(Line_0051): 8. X-- On March 1, a seller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to a buyer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31. The buyer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to a creditor of the seller in satisfaction of a debt which the seller said he had promised to pay the creditor.
(Line_0052): On March 10, the buyer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to the creditor. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed $45,000 rather than $46,000 as the purchase price. Neither the buyer nor the seller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to the creditor.
(Line_0053): In an action by the creditor against the buyer for $25,000, which of the following, if proved, would best serve the buyer as a defense?
(Line_0054): A. There was no consideration to support the seller's antecedent promise to pay the creditor the $25,000.
(Line_0055): B. On March 5, before the creditor was aware of the oral agreement between the seller and the buyer, the seller agreed with the buyer not to pay any part of the purchase price to the creditor.
(Line_0056): C. Whatever action the creditor may have had against the buyer was barred by the statute of limitations prior to March 1.
(Line_0057): D. Before he instituted his action against the buyer, the creditor had not notified either the buyer or seller that he had accepted the buyer-seller arrangement for paying the creditor.

Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to the creditor. If the buyer refused to pay more than $45,000 for Homestead, in an action by the seller against the buyer for an additional $1,000, it would be to the seller's advantage to try to prove that
(Line_0060): A. the writing was intended only as a sham.
(Line_0061): B. the writing was only a partial integration.
(Line_0062): C. there was a mistake in integration.
(Line_0063): D. there was a misunderstanding between the seller and the buyer concerning the purchase price.

(Line_0065): 10. A landowner was the owner of a large subdivision. A purchaser became interested in purchasing a lot but could not decide between Lot 40 and Lot 41. The price and fair market value of each of those two lots was $5,000. The purchaser paid the landowner $5,000, which the landowner accepted, and the landowner delivered to the purchaser a deed which was properly executed, complete, and ready for recording in every detail except that the space in the deed for the lot number was left blank. The landowner told the purchaser to fill in either Lot 40 or Lot 41 according to his decision and then to record the deed. The purchaser visited the development the next day and completely changed his mind, selecting Lot 25. He filled in Lot 25 and duly recorded the deed. The price of Lot 25 and its fair market value was $7,500. Before the landowner had time to learn of the purchaser's actions, the purchaser sold Lot 25 to a neighbor for $6,000 by a duly and properly executed, delivered, and recorded warranty deed. The neighbor knew that the landowner had put a price of $7,500 on Lot 25, but he knew no other facts regarding the landowner-purchaser transaction. The neighbor's attorney accurately reported the purchaser's record title to be good, marketable, and free of encumbrances. Neither the neighbor nor his attorney made any further investigation outside the record. The landowner brought an appropriate action against the neighbor to recover title to Lot 25. If the landowner loses, the most likely basis for the judgment is that
(Line_0066): A. the Statute of Frauds prevents the introduction of any evidence of the landowner's and the purchaser's agreement.
(Line_0067): B. recording of the deed from the landowner to the purchaser precludes any question of its genuineness.
(Line_0068): C. as between the landowner and a bona fide purchaser, the landowner is estopped.
(Line_0069): D. the clean hands doctrine bars the landowner from relief.

(Line_0071): 11. While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile driven by a woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident." The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill.
(Line_0072): The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating that his son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate. The father replied: "If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you."
(Line_0073): In an action by the woman against the father for wages lost while she was incapacitated as a result of the accident, which of the following would be the father's best defense?
(Line_0074): A. Lack of consideration
(Line_0075): B. Mistake of fact as to basic assumption
(Line_0076): C. Statute of Frauds
(Line_0077): D. Indefiniteness of the father's promise

(Line_0080): The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries.
(Line_0081): Which of the following, if true, would be significant in determining whether or not there was bargained-for consideration to support the father's promise to the physician?
(Line_0082): I. The physician had not begun treating the woman before the father called him.

(Line_0084): II. The father had a contract with the woman.
(Line_0085): A. I only

(Line_0092): If the physician discontinued treating the woman before she had fully recovered and the woman brought an action against the physician for breach of contract, which of the following arguments, if any, by the physician would probably be effective in defense?
(Line_0093): I. The woman furnished no consideration, either express or implied.
(Line_0094): II. The physician's contract was with the father and not with the woman.
(Line_0095): III. Whatever contract the physician may have had with the woman was discharged by novation on account of the agreement with the father.

The father replied: "If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you."
(Line_0103): If the creditor did not file action against the son's estate, would the creditor succeed in an action against the father for $200?
(Line_0104): A. Yes, because the creditor had detrimentally relied on the father's promise.
(Line_0105): B. Yes, because the father's promise was supported by a bargained-for exchange.
(Line_0106): C. No, because the creditor's claim against the son's estate was worthless.
(Line_0107): D. No, because the father at most had only a moral obligation to pay the son's debts.

The father replied: "If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you."
(Line_0110): The father honestly believed that he did not owe the creditor anything and at first refused to pay anything to the creditor. If the creditor, honestly believing that the father owed him $200, then accepts $150 from the father in settlement of the claim, will the creditor succeed in an action against the father for the remaining $50?
(Line_0111): A. Yes, because the son's debt of $200 was liquidated and undisputed.
(Line_0112): B. Yes, because the creditor honestly believed that he had a legal right against the father for the full $200.
(Line_0113): C. No, because the father honestly believed that the creditor did not have a legal right against him for the $200.
(Line_0114): D. No, because the father was not contractually obligated to pay the creditor $200 in the first place.

(Line_0116): 16. On March 1, a computer programming company orally agreed with a department store to write a set of programs for the department store’s computer and to coordinate the programs with the department store’s billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety:
(Line_0117): The department store will pay the computer programming company $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store’s Zenon 747 computer; the computer programming company to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing.
(Line_0118): On June 6, the computer programming company demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. The parties orally agreed that the store should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of the store’s computer systems manager. On July 5, the programming company completed the programs. Tests showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with the store’s billing methods, cut processing time by only 47 percent. The department store’s computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion, requested that the escrow agent return the $20,000, and asserted that nothing was owed to the programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs.
(Line_0119): The department store denies liability on the ground that the programming company had orally agreed to coordinate with the department store’s methods of accounting, and the programming company seeks to bar introduction of that agreement based on the parol evidence rule. The department store’s most effective argument is that
(Line_0120): A. the parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence for the purpose of interpreting a written agreement.
(Line_0121): B. the memorandum was not a completely integrated agreement.
(Line_0122): C. the department store detrimentally relied on the oral promise of coordination in signing the memorandum.

(Line_0129): On July 5, the computer programming company completed the programs. Tests showed that the computer programs cut processing time by only 47 percent. The department store’s computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs.
(Line_0130): If the computer programming company in fact had half-completed the job on June 6, would it then have been entitled to $10,000?
(Line_0131): A. Yes, because June 6 was within one month of completion
(Line_0132): B. Yes, because the computer programming company had done one-half the job.
(Line_0133): C. No, because of a constructive condition precedent requiring at least substantial completion of the work before the department store would have a duty to pay.
(Line_0134): D. No, because "within one month of completion" would, in these circumstances, be interpreted to mean "within one month after completion."

(Line_0140): Was the escrow agreement a valid modification?
(Line_0141): A. Yes, because it was the compromise of an honest dispute.
(Line_0142): B. Yes, because the Statute of Frauds does not apply to subsequent oral modifications.
(Line_0143): C. No, because it was oral.

The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, the computer programming company completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by the computer programming company and the department store computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with the department store’s billing methods, cut processing time by only 47 percent. They would, however, save the department store $12,000 a year. Further, if the department store would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by the computer programming company, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58 percent, saving the department store another $8,000 a year.

The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs.
(Line_0150): Assume that the programs completed on July 5 had cut processing time by one-half for all of the department store’s financial transactions. Is the department store entitled to renounce the contract because of the computer programming company’s delay in completion?
(Line_0151): A. Yes, because "the computer programming company to complete by July 1" is an express condition.
(Line_0152): B. Yes, because the doctrine of substantial performance does not apply to commercial contracts.
(Line_0153): C. No, because both parties manifested an understanding that time was not of the essence.

Can the computer programming company nevertheless recover the reasonable value of its service?
(Line_0170): A. Yes, because continued use of the programs by the department store would save at least $12,000 a year.
(Line_0171): B. Yes, because the department store was continuing to use programs created by the computer programming company for which, as the department store knew, the computer programming company expected to be paid.

(Line_0175): 22. X-- An assistant professor was hired by a college to teach mathematics and he is now in his third consecutive one-year contract. Under state law he cannot acquire tenure until after five consecutive annual contracts. In his third year, the assistant professor was notified that he was not being rehired for the following year. Applicable state law and college rules did not require either a statement of reasons or a hearing, and in fact neither was offered to the assistant professor.
(Line_0176): Which of the following, if established, sets forth the strongest argument the assistant professor could make to compel the college to furnish him a statement of reasons for the failure to rehire him and an opportunity for a hearing?
(Line_0177): A. There is no evidence that tenured teachers are any more qualified than he is.
(Line_0178): B. He leased a home in reliance on an oral promise of reemployment by the college president.
(Line_0179): C. He was the only teacher at the college whose contract was not renewed that year.
(Line_0180): D. In the expectation of remaining at the college, he had just moved his elderly parents to the town in which college is located.
(Line_0181):  
(Line_0182): 23. An elderly widower lived alone on a small farm which he owned. Except for the farm, including the house and its furnishings, the widower owned substantially no property. Under proper management, the farm was capable of producing an adequate family income, but the widower was unable to do farm work or even to provide for his own personal needs. The widower entered into an oral contract with his nephew by which the widower agreed to convey the farm to his nephew if the nephew moved into the house with the widower, operated the farm, and took care of the widower for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was to be conveyed. The nephew, who lived about fifty miles away where he was operating a small business of his own, terminated his business and moved in with the widower. With the assistance of his wife, the nephew gave the widower excellent care until the widower died intestate about five years after the date of the contract.
(Line_0183): In his final years the widower was confined to his bed and required much personal service of an intimate and arduous sort. The widower was survived by his only son who was also the widower's sole heir. The son resided in a distant city and gave his father no attention in his father's final years. The son showed up for the widower's funeral and demanded that the nephew vacate the farm immediately. Upon the nephew's refusal to do so, the son brought an appropriate action for possession. The nephew answered by way of a counterclaim to establish the nephew's right to possession and title to the farm.
(Line_0184): If the court's decision is in favor of the nephew, it will be because
(Line_0185): A. the land is located in a state where the Statute of Frauds will not be applied if there has been such part performance as will result in an irreparable hardship if the contract is not performed.
(Line_0186): B. the land is located in a state where the Statute of Frauds will not be applied if there has been such part performance that is by its very nature unequivocally referable to the contract.
(Line_0187): C. the son is precluded by the "clean hands" doctrine from enforcing his claim against the nephew.
(Line_0188): D. the blood relationship of uncle-nephew is sufficient to remove the necessity for any writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.
(Line_0189):  
(Line_0190): 24. X-- During 2006 a series of arsons, one of which damaged a huge store, occurred in a city. In early 2007 the city’s City Council adopted this resolution:
(Line_0191): The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed here.
(Line_0192): The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 "for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire." Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store’s president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective’s investigation, the store’s employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward.

(Line_0198):  
(Line_0199): 25. X-- During 2006 a series of arsons, one of which damaged a huge store, occurred in a city. In early 2007 the city’s City Council adopted this resolution:
(Line_0200): The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed here.
(Line_0201): The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 "for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire." Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store’s president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware.

(Line_0230): A. The city was benefited as a result of the detective's services.
(Line_0231): B. The city's offer was in the nature of a bounty, so that the elements of contract are not essential to the city's liability.
(Line_0232): C. The fact that the city attempted to revoke its offer only a few months after making it demonstrated that the attempted revocation was in bad faith.
(Line_0233): D. Although there was no bargained for exchange between the detective and the city, the detective's claim for the reward is supported by a moral obligation on the part of the city.

The manufacturer's sales people are employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission, the salesperson must be in the employment of the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer.
(Line_0243): In 2006, a salesperson for the manufacturer worked for eight months to get an order from a large corporation for a $750,000 computer. He consulted extensively with the corporation's top executives and worked with its operating personnel to develop detailed specifications for the new equipment. He also promised the corporation, with the manufacturer's knowledge and approval, to assist the corporation for six months after installation in making the equipment work.
(Line_0244): On January 1, 2007, the corporation signed an order, and on March 1, the computer was installed. On March 15, the manufacturer fired the salesperson on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 2005 and 2006 sales quotas.

(Line_0248): B. The salesperson will win, because he had promised the corporation that he would assist in making the equipment work.
(Line_0249): C. The manufacturer will win, because the coworker is entitled to the commission on a quantum meruit basis.
(Line_0250): D. The manufacturer will win, because the salesperson was not employed as the manufacturer's salesperson when the company was billed for the computer.

(Line_0257): B. The salesperson will win, because the manufacturer made an implied-in-fact promise to pay a reasonable commission for services that result in sales.
(Line_0258): C. The salesperson will lose, because there is an express contractual provision pre-empting the subject of compensation for his services.
(Line_0259): D. The salesperson will lose, because he cannot perform his agreement to assist the customer for six months.

X-- A new business enterprise about to commence the manufacture of clothing, entered into written agreement to purchase all of its monthly requirements of a certain elasticized fabric for a period of three years from a fabric company at a specified unit price, and agreed upon delivery and payment terms. The agreement also provided:
(Line_0275): 1. The parties covenant not to assign this contract.
(Line_0276): 2. Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business enterprise to the creditor of the fabric company. The fabric company promptly made an "assignment of the contract" to a finance company as security for a $100,000 loan.

(Line_0307): Two weeks after making the $5,000 payment to the fabric company, the new business enterprise, by written notice to the fabric company, terminated the agreement for purchase of the elasticized fabric because market conditions had in fact forced the new business enterprise out of the clothing manufacture business. In an immediate suit by the finance company against the new business enterprise for total breach, which of the following would be useful in the new business enterprise's defense?
(Line_0308): A. The fabric company's rights under its agreement with the new business enterprise were personal and therefore nonassignable.
(Line_0309): B. The fabric company's "assignment of the contract" to the finance company to secure a loan would normally be interpreted as a delegation of the fabric company's duties under the contract as well as an assignment of its rights; and its duties, owed to the new business enterprise, were personal and therefore non-delegable.
(Line_0310): C. The original contract between the new business enterprise and the fabric company was unenforceable by either party for want of legally sufficient consideration for the fabric company's promise to supply the new business enterprise's requirements of the elasticized fabric.

The contract provided for an "inside date" of April 1, 2007 and an "outside date" of May 1, 2007, for completion of the house and delivery of a deed. Neither party tendered performance on the dates stated. On May 3, 2007, the builder notified the landowner in writing of the builder's election to cancel the contract because of the landowner's failure to deliver title by May 1. On May 12, the landowner notified the builder that some unanticipated construction difficulties had been encountered but that the landowner was entitled to a reasonable time to complete. The notification also included a promise that the landowner would be ready to perform by May 29 and that he was setting that date as an adjourned closing date. The landowner obtained a certificate of occupancy and appropriate documents of title, and he tendered performance on May 29. The builder refused. The landowner brought an action to recover damages for breach of contract. The decision in the case will most likely be determined by whether
(Line_0314): A. The landowner acted with due diligence in completing the house.
(Line_0315): B. The landowner can prove actual "undue hardship" caused by the delay.
(Line_0316): C. the expressions "inside date" and "outside date" are construed to make time of the essence.

(Line_0330): C. has a cause of action against the painter for damages only after he has first exhausted his remedies against the contractor.
(Line_0331): D. does not have a cause of action against the painter for damages, because he waived his rights against the painter by permitting the contractor to perform the work.

(Line_0365): On November 12, the widget salesman took his Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman's residence; he arrived at 11:15 a.m. The pharmaceutical salesman was asleep and did not answer the ringing doorbell until 12:15 p.m. The pharmaceutical salesman then rejected the widget salesman's bike on the ground that he had already bought someone else's bike.
(Line_0366): In the pharmaceutical salesman's letter of October 8, what was the legal effect of the language: "This offer is not subject to countermand"?
(Line_0367): A. Under the Uniform Commercial Code the offer was irrevocable until noon, November 12.
(Line_0368): B. Such language prevented an effective acceptance by the widget salesman prior to noon, November 12.
(Line_0369): C. At common law, such language created a binding option in the widget salesman's favor.
(Line_0370): D. Such language did not affect the offeror's power of revocation of the offer.

(Line_0372): 44. X-- Two salesmen, who lived in different suburbs twenty miles apart, were golfing acquaintances at the Interurban Country Club. Both were traveling salesmen--one for a pharmaceutical company and the other for a widget manufacturer. The pharmaceutical salesman wrote the widget salesman by United States mail on Friday, October 8:
(Line_0373): I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club and will buy your Sujocki for $1,200 upon your bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or before noon, November 12 next. This offer is not subject to countermand.
(Line_0374): Sincerely,
(Line_0375): [signed] the pharmaceutical salesman
(Line_0376): The widget salesman replied by mail the following day:
(Line_0377): I accept your offer, and promise to deliver the bike as you specified.

(Line_0384): In a lawsuit by the widget salesman against the pharmaceutical salesman for breach of contract, what would the court probably decide regarding the widget salesman's letter of October 9?
(Line_0385): A. The letter bound both parties to a unilateral contract as soon as the widget salesman mailed it.
(Line_0386): B. Mailing of the letter by the widget salesman did not, of itself, prevent a subsequent, effective revocation by the pharmaceutical salesman of his offer.
(Line_0387): C. The letter bound both parties to a bilateral contract, but only when received by the pharmaceutical salesman on November 10.
(Line_0388): D. Regardless of whether the pharmaceutical salesman's offer had proposed a unilateral or a bilateral contract, the letter was an effective acceptance upon receipt, if not upon dispatch.

(Line_0401): What is the probable legal effect of the friend's conversation with the widget salesman and report that he (the friend) had sold his Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman on November 10?
(Line_0402): A. This report had no legal effect because the pharmaceutical salesman's offer was irrevocable until November 12.
(Line_0403): B. Unless a contract had already been formed between the widget salesman and the pharmaceutical salesman, the friend's report to the widget salesman operated to terminate the widget salesman's power of accepting the pharmaceutical salesman's offer.
(Line_0404): C. This report has no legal effect because the offer had been made by a prospective buyer (the pharmaceutical salesman) rather than a prospective seller.
(Line_0405): D. The friend's conversation with the widget salesman on November 11 terminated the pharmaceutical salesman's original offer and operated as an offer by the friend to buy the widget salesman's Sujocki for $950.

(Line_0407): 46. On May 1 a lot owner telegraphed a buyer, "Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grover subdivision at $5,000 each. Details will follow in letter." The letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of payment, insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, "This offer remains open until June 1."
(Line_0408): On May 2, after he had received the telegram but before he had received the letter, the buyer telegraphed the owner, "Accept your offer with respect to lot 101." Both parties knew that there were fifty lots in the Grover subdivision and that they were numbered 101 through 150.
(Line_0409): Assume that the owner and the buyer were bound by a contract for the sale of lot 101 for $5,000, that on May 3 the owner telephoned the buyer to explain that because he had just discovered that a shopping center was going to be erected adjacent to the Grove subdivision, he would "have to have $6,000 for each of the lots including lot 101," that the buyer thereupon agreed to pay him $6,000 for lot 101, and that on May 6 the buyer telegraphed, "Accept your offer with respect to the rest of the lots." Assuming that two contracts were formed and that there is no controlling statute, the buyer will most likely be required to pay
(Line_0410): A. only $5,000 for each of the fifty lots.
(Line_0411): B. only $5,000 for lot 101, but $6,000 for the remaining forty-nine lots.
(Line_0412): C. $6,000 for each of the fifty lots.
(Line_0413): D. $6,000 for lot 101, but only $5,000 for the remaining forty-nine lots.

(Line_0417): Assume that on May 5 the owner telephoned the buyer to explain that he had sold lots 102 through 150 to someone else on May 4 and that the buyer thereafter telegraphed the owner, "Will take the rest of the lots." Assume further that there is no controlling statute. In an action by the buyer against the owner for breach of contract, the buyer probably will
(Line_0418): A. succeed, because the owner had promised him that the offer would remain open until June 1.
(Line_0419): B. succeed, because the owner's attempted revocation was by telephone.
(Line_0420): C. not succeed, because the buyer's power of acceptance was terminated by the owner's sale of the lots to another party.
(Line_0421): D. not succeed, because the buyer's power of acceptance was terminated by an effective revocation.

(Line_0425): Assume that on May 6 the buyer telegraphed the owner, "Will take the rest of the lots," and that on May 8 the owner discovered that he did not have good title to the remaining lots. Which of the following would provide the best legal support to the owner's contention that he was not liable for breach of contract as to the remaining forty-nine lots?
(Line_0426): A. Impossibility of performance
(Line_0427): B. Unilateral mistake as to basic assumption
(Line_0428): C. Termination of the offer by the buyer's having first contracted to buy lot 101
(Line_0429): D. Excuse by failure of an implied condition precedent.

(Line_0431): 49. X--A victim, injured by a driver in an auto accident, employed an attorney to represent him in the matter. The victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, the attorney wrote into their contract his promise to the victim "to pay from any settlement with the driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for the victim's injuries." The contract also provided that the attorney's duties were "non-assignable." The attorney immediately filed suit against the driver. The victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at $1,000, from a doctor, but failed to inform the doctor of the attorney's promise.
(Line_0432): After receiving a bill from the doctor for $1,000, the victim immediately wrote doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with the attorney.
(Line_0433): The victim then asked the attorney about payment of this bill, but the attorney requested a release from their employment contract, stating that he would like to refer the victim's claim to a colleague and that the colleague was willing to represent the victim in the pending lawsuit. The victim wrote a letter to the attorney releasing him from their contract and agreeing to the colleague's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to the doctor. The colleague subsequently promised the attorney to represent the victim and soon negotiated a settlement of the victim's claim against the driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by the victim to creditors other than the doctor. The victim remains insolvent.
(Line_0434): In an action by the doctor against the victim to recover $1,000, the doctor's best theory of recovery is that the doctor
(Line_0435): A. is a creditor beneficiary of the employment contract between the victim and the attorney.
(Line_0436): B. is a donee beneficiary of the employment contract between the victim and the attorney.
(Line_0437): C. provided services essential to the preservation of victim's health.
(Line_0438): D. has a claim based upon an implied-in-fact contract with the victim.

The victim remains insolvent.
(Line_0443): In an action by the doctor against the attorney upon the attorney's employment contract with the victim, the attorney is likely to argue in defense that
(Line_0444): A. the anti-assignment clause in the attorney's contract with the victim is void as against public policy.
(Line_0445): B. the attorney has relied to his detriment on the victim's letter of release.
(Line_0446): C. third parties cannot acquire valid claims under an attorney-client contract.
(Line_0447): D. the doctor has not materially changed his position in reliance upon the attorney's employment contract.

(Line_0452): In an action by the doctor against the attorney upon the attorney's employment contract with the victim, if the attorney attempted to use the victim's release as a defense, the doctor is likely to argue that
(Line_0453): A. the release was ineffective, because the doctor had impliedly assented to the victim-attorney contract.
(Line_0454): B. the release was ineffective, because the victim would thereby be unjustly enriched.
(Line_0455): C. there was no consideration for the victim's release of the attorney.
(Line_0456): D. the attorney's contract duties were too personal to be effectively delegated to the colleague.

(Line_0461): A. the colleague made only a gratuitous promise to the attorney.
(Line_0462): B. at the time the colleague promised to represent the victim, the doctor was only a member of an unidentified class of beneficiaries.
(Line_0463): C. there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the doctor was either a creditor or donee beneficiary of the colleague's promise to the attorney.

(Line_0466): 53. On March 1, a landowner and builder orally agreed that the builder would erect a boathouse on the landowner's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse, across a neighbor's lot, to a lake. The neighbor had already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15, and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10,000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2,500 on March 15; $2,500 when the boathouse was completed; $5,000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel.
(Line_0467): Assume that the landowner tendered the $2,500 on March 15, and that the builder refused to accept it or to perform. In an action by the landowner against the builder for breach of contract, which of the following can the builder successfully use as a defense?
(Line_0468): I. The neighbor-landowner agreement permitting the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot was not in writing.
(Line_0469): II. The landowner-builder agreement was not in writing.

Pursuant to that promise, the father telephoned his old contractor-friend on May 1, 2001, and made the following oral agreement--each making full and accurate written notes thereof:
(Line_0486): The contractor was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by the father, and the father was to pay therefore $20 per tree. The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of $18,000. The father agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1, 2001, upon monthly presentation of certificate by Builders, Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met.
(Line_0487): The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001, when he also began building the house. The father made three $2,000 payments for the work done in July, August, and September 2001, without requiring a certificate. The contractor worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 2001, to the end of February 2002, because of bad weather, and the father made no payments during that period. The contractor did not object. On March 1, 2002, the contractor demanded payment of $2,000, but the father refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement.
(Line_0488): Assuming that the contractor committed a total breach on March 1, 2002, what would be the probable measure of the father's damages in an action against the contractor for breach of contract?
(Line_0489): A. Restitution of the three monthly installments paid in August, September, and October
(Line_0490): B. What it would cost to get the house completed by another contractor, minus installments not yet paid to the contractor
(Line_0491): C. The difference between the market value of the partly built house, as of the time of the contractor's breach, and the market value of the house if completed according to specifications

Because the customer suddenly became ill, the photographer was unable to take the necessary photograph of the customer and his family until the first week of December. The final week's delay was caused by the photographer's not being notified promptly by the the customer of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17, the photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, the customer refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm's length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, "The photograph makes me look too old.

There was no current public quotation of the price of Chemco stock. The book value of Chemco stock, according to the statement, was $5 a share; its actual value was $30 a share.
(Line_0647): Knowing these facts, the engineer offered to purchase from a stockholder at $6 a share the 1,000 shares of Chemco stock owned by the stockholder. The stockholder and the engineer had not previously met. The stockholder sold the stock to the engineer for $6 a share.

On January 15, in a signed writing, an artist agreed to remodel a building owner's building according to certain specifications, and the owner to pay the agreed price of $5,000 to the artist's niece as a birthday present. The niece did not learn of the agreement until her birthday on May 5. Before they signed the writing, the artist and the owner had orally agreed that their "written agreement will be null and void unless the owner is able to obtain a $5,000 loan from the bank before January 31." The owner was unable to obtain the loan, and, on January 31, phoned the artist and told him, "Don't begin the work. The deal is off." In an action for breach of contract brought against the owner by the proper party, will the owner be successful in asserting as a defense his inability to obtain a loan?
(Line_0676): A. Yes, because obtaining a loan was a condition precedent to the existence of an enforceable contract.
(Line_0677): B. Yes, because the agreement about obtaining a loan is a modification of a construction contract and is not required to be in writing.
(Line_0678): C. No. because the agreement about obtaining a loan contradicts the express and implied terms of the writing.
(Line_0679): D. No, because the owner is estopped to deny the validity of the written agreement.

(Line_0682): The owner obtained the loan, the artist completed the remodeling on May 1, and on May 3, at the artist's request, the owner paid the $5,000 to the artist. If the niece learns of the owner's payment to the artist on May 5 at the same time she learns of the written the artist-owner contract, will she succeed in action against the owner for $5,000?
(Line_0683): A. Yes, because she is an intended beneficiary of the written artist-owner contract.
(Line_0684): B. Yes, because the written artist-owner contract operated as an assignment to the niece, and the artist thereby lost whatever rights he may have had to the $5,000.
(Line_0685): C. No, because the niece had not furnished any consideration to support the owner's promise to pay $5,000 to her.
(Line_0686): D. No, because on May 3, the artist and the owner effectively modified their written contract, thereby depriving the niece of whatever right she may have had under that contract.

When a woman's 21-year-old daughter finished college, the woman handed her a signed memorandum stating that if she would go to law school for three academic years, she would pay her tuition, room, and board and would "give her a $1,000 bonus" for each "A" she got in law school. The daughter's uncle, who was present on this occasion, read the memorandum and thereupon said to the daughter, "and if she doesn't pay your expenses, I will." The woman paid her tuition, room, and board for her first year but died just before the end of that year. Subsequently, the daughter learned that she had received two "A's" in the second semester. The executor of the woman's estate has refused to pay her anything for the two "A's" and has told her that the estate will no longer pay her tuition, room, and board in law school.
(Line_0691): In an action by the daughter against the uncle on account of the executor's repudiation of the woman's promise to pay future tuition, room, and board, which of the following would be the uncle's strongest defense?
(Line_0692): A. The parties did not manifestly intend a contract.
(Line_0693): B. The woman's death terminated the agreement.
(Line_0694): C. The agreement was oral.
(Line_0695): D. The agreement was divisible.

The executor of the woman's estate has refused to pay her anything for the two "A's" and has told her that the estate will no longer pay her tuition, room, and board in law school. In an action against the woman's estate for $2,000 on account of the two "A's" if the only defense raised is lack of consideration, the daughter probably will
(Line_0698): A. succeed under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
(Line_0699): B. succeed on a theory of bargained-for exchange for her mother's promise.
(Line_0700): C. not succeed, because the $1,000 for each "A" was promised only as a bonus.
(Line_0701): D. not succeed, because the daughter was already legally obligated to use her best efforts in law school.

(Line_0703): 81. A seller contracted in writing to deliver to a buyer 100 bushels of wheat on August 1 at $3.50 a bushel. Because his suppliers had not delivered enough wheat to him by that time, the seller on August 1 had only 95 bushels of wheat with which to fulfill his contract with the buyer. If the seller tenders 95 bushels of wheat to the buyer on August 1, and the buyer refused to accept or pay for any of the wheat, which of the following best states the legal relationship between the seller and the buyer?
(Line_0704): A. The seller has a cause of action against the buyer, because the seller has substantially performed his contract.
(Line_0705): B. The seller is excused from performing his contract because of impossibility of performance.
(Line_0706): C. The buyer has a cause of action against the seller for the seller's failure to deliver 100 bushels of wheat.
(Line_0707): D. The buyer is obligated to give the seller a reasonable time to attempt to obtain the other five bushels of wheat.
(Line_0708):  
(Line_0709): 82. On March 31, a seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement in which the seller agreed to fabricate and sell to the buyer 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by the buyer. The contract provided that the buyer would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give the seller funds to "tool up" for the work; that the seller would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that the buyer would pay the balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that the seller would deliver the balance of the brake linings on June 30. On May 10, the seller notified the buyer that it was doubtful whether the seller could perform because of problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15, however, the seller assured the buyer that the production difficulties had been overcome, and the buyer paid the seller the first 50 percent installment of the purchase price. The seller did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on May 31, or at any time thereafter; and on June 10, the seller notified that it would not perform the contract.
(Line_0710): Which of the following correctly states the buyer's rights and obligations immediately after receipt of the seller's notice on May 10?
(Line_0711): A. The buyer can treat the notice as an anticipatory repudiation, and has cause of action on May 10 for breach of the entire contract.
(Line_0712): B. The buyer can treat the notice as an anticipatory repudiation, and can sue to enjoin an actual breach by the seller on May 31.
(Line_0713): C. The buyer has no cause of action for breach of contract, but can suspend its performance and demand assurances that the seller will perform.
(Line_0714): D. The buyer has no cause of action for breach of contract, and must pay the installment of the purchase price due on May 15 to preserve its rights under the contract.

(Line_0718): Which of the following is NOT a correct statement of the parties' legal status immediately after the seller's notice on June 10?
(Line_0719): A. The buyer has a cause of action for total breach of contract because of the seller's repudiation, but that cause of action will be lost if the seller retracts its repudiation before the buyer changes its position or manifests to the seller that the buyer considers the repudiation final.
(Line_0720): B. The buyer can bring suit to rescind the contract even if it elects to await the seller's performance for a commercially reasonable time.
(Line_0721): C. The buyer can await performance by the seller for a commercially reasonable time, but if the buyer awaits performance beyond that period, it cannot recover any resulting damages that it reasonably could have avoided.
(Line_0722): D. The buyer has a cause of action for breach of contract that it can successfully assert only after it has given the seller a commercially reasonable time to perform.

(Line_0724): 84. A corporation, through its president, requested from a financing company a short-term loan of $100,000. On April 1, the corporation's president and the financing company's loan officer agreed orally that the financing company would make the loan on the following terms: (1) The loan would be repaid in full on or before the following July 1 and would carry interest at an annual rate of 15 percent (a lawful rate under the applicable usury law), and (2) the corporation's president would personally guarantee repayment. The loan was approved and made on April 5. The only document evidencing the loan was a memorandum, written and supplied by the financing company and signed by the corporation's president for the corporation, that read in its entirety:
(Line_0725): "April 5
(Line_0726): In consideration of a loan advanced on this date, the corporation hereby promises to pay the financing company, $100,000 on September 1.
(Line_0727): The corporation
(Line_0728): By /s/ the president"
(Line_0729): The corporation did not repay the loan on or before July 1, although it had sufficient funds to do so. On July 10, the financing company sued the corporation as principal debtor and the corporation's president individually as guarantor for $100,000, plus 15 percent interest from April 5.
(Line_0730): At the trial, can the financing company prove the corporation's oral commitment to repay the loan on or before July 1?
(Line_0731): A. Yes, because the oral agreement was supported by an independent consideration.
(Line_0732): B. Yes, because the evidence of the parties' negotiations is relevant to their contractual intent concerning maturity of the debt.
(Line_0733): C. No, because such evidence is barred by the preexisting duty rule.
(Line_0734): D. No, because such evidence contradicts the writing and is barred by the parol evidence rule.

(Line_0736): 85. A corporation, through its president, requested from a financing company a short-term loan of $100,000.

(Line_0737): "April 5
(Line_0738): In consideration of a loan advanced on this date, the corporation hereby promises to pay the financing company, $100,000 on September 1.
(Line_0739): The corporation

(Line_0742): At the trial, can the financing company prove the president's oral promise to guarantee the loan?
(Line_0743): A. Yes, because the president signed the memorandum.
(Line_0744): B. Yes, because, as president of the debtor company, the president is a third-party beneficiary of the loan.
(Line_0745): C. No, because there was no separate consideration for the president's promise.
(Line_0746): D. No, because such proof is barred by the statute of frauds.

(Line_0748): 86. A landowner owned Broadacres in fee simple. For a consideration of $5,000, the landowner gave his neighbor a written option to purchase Broadacres for $300,000. The option was assignable. For a consideration of $10,000, the neighbor subsequently gave an option to his friend to purchase Broadacres for $325,000. The friend exercised his option.

(Line_0750): The neighbor thereupon exercised his option. The neighbor paid the agreed price of $300,000 and took title to Broadacres by deed from the landowner. Thereafter, the friend refused to consummate his purchase.
(Line_0751): The neighbor brought an appropriate action against the friend for specific performance, or, if that should be denied, then for damages. The friend counterclaimed for return of the $10,000. In this action the court will
(Line_0752): A. grant money damages only to the neighbor.
(Line_0753): B. grant specific performance to the neighbor.
(Line_0754): C. grant the neighbor only the right to retain the $10,000.
(Line_0755): D. require the neighbor to refund the $10,000 to the friend.
(Line_0756):  
(Line_0757): 87. X--A written contract was entered into between a financier-investor and a winery. The contract provided that the financier-investor would invest $1,000,000 in the winery for its capital expansion and, in return, that the winery, from grapes grown in it famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under a label with the financier's name on it.
(Line_0758): The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by the winery only through a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility.
(Line_0759): A bank lent the financier-investor $200,000 and the financier-investor executed a written instrument providing that the bank "is entitled to collect the debt from my share of the profits, if any, under the the winery-investor contract." The bank gave prompt notice of this transaction to the winery.
(Line_0760): If the winery thereafter refused to account for any profits to the bank, and the bank sues the winery for the financier-investor's share of profits then realized, the winery's strongest argument in defense is that
(Line_0761): A. the investor-winery contract did not expressly authorize an assignment of rights.
(Line_0762): B. the financier-investor and the winery are partners, not simply debtor and creditor.
(Line_0763): C. the bank is not an assignee of the financier-investor's rights under the investor-winery contract.
(Line_0764): D. the bank is not an intended third-party beneficiary of the investor-winery contract.
(Line_0765):  
(Line_0766): 88. A written contract was entered into between a financier-investor and a winery. The contract provided that the financier-investor would invest $1,000,000 in the winery for its capital expansion and, in return, that the winery, from grapes grown in it famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under a label with the financier's name on it.
(Line_0767): The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by the winery only through a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility.
(Line_0768): Soon after making its contract with the the financier-investor, the winery, without the the financier-investor's knowledge or assent, sold its vineyards but not its winery to a large agricultural corporation. Under the terms of this sale, the agricultural corporation agreed to sell to the winery all grapes grown on the land for five years. The agricultural corporation's employees have no experience in winegrape production, and the agricultural corporation has no reputation in the wine industry as a grape producer or otherwise. The investor-winery contract was silent on the matter of the winery selling any or all of its business assets.
(Line_0769): If the financier-investor seeks an appropriate judicial remedy against the winery for entering into the winery-agricultural corporation transaction, is the financier-investor likely to prevail?
(Line_0770): A. Yes, because the winery-agricultural corporation transaction created a significant risk of diminishing the profits in which the financier-investor would share under his contract with the winery.
(Line_0771): B. Yes, because the investor-winery contract did not contain a provision authorizing a delegation of the winery's duties.
(Line_0772): C. No, because the winery remains in a position to perform under the investor-winery contract.
(Line_0773): D. No, because the winery, as a corporation, must necessarily perform its contracts by delegating duties to individuals.

(Line_0775): 89. X-- On June 1, a manufacturer of men's neckties received the following order from a retailer: "Ship 500 two-inch ties, assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34. Delivery by July 1."
(Line_0776): On June 1, the manufacturer shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at the retailer's place of business on June 3. The retailer immediately telegraphed the manufacturer: "Reject your shipment. Order was for two-inch ties." The retailer, however, did not ship the ties back to the manufacturer. The manufacturer replied by telegram: "Will deliver proper ties before July 1." The retailer received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it.
(Line_0777): On June 30, the manufacturer tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No. V34, but the retailer refused to accept them.
(Line_0778): Did the retailer properly reject the ties delivered on June 3?
(Line_0779): A. Yes, because the ties were nonconforming goods.
(Line_0780): B. Yes, because the manufacturer did not notify the retailer that the ties were shipped as an accommodation to the retailer.
(Line_0781): C. No, because the manufacturer could accept the retailer's offer by prompt shipment of either conforming or nonconforming goods.
(Line_0782): D. No, because the retailer waived his right to reject the ties by not returning them promptly to the manufacturer.
(Line_0783):  
(Line_0784): 90. On June 1, a manufacturer of men's neckties received the following order from a retailer: "Ship 500 two-inch ties, assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34. Delivery by July 1."

(Line_0785): On June 30, the manufacturer tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No. V34, but the retailer refused to accept them.
(Line_0786): Did the retailer properly reject the ties tendered on June 30?
(Line_0787): A. Yes, because the manufacturer's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was a present breach of contract.
(Line_0788): B. Yes, because the manufacturer's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was an anticipatory repudiation.
(Line_0789): C. No, because the manufacturer cured the June 1 defective delivery by his tender of conforming goods on June 30.
(Line_0790): D. No, because a contract for sale of goods can be modified without consideration.

(Line_0792): 91. A wealthy widow, wishing to make a substantial and potentially enduring gift to her beloved adult stepson, established with a bank a passbook savings account by an initial deposit of $10,000.
(Line_0793): The passbook was issued solely in the stepson's name, but the widow retained possession of it, and the stepson was not then informed of the savings account. Subsequently, the widow became disgusted with the stepson's behavior and decided to give the same savings account solely to her beloved adult daughter. As permitted by the rules of the bank, the widow effected this change by agreement with the bank. This time she left possession of the passbook with the bank. Shortly thereafter, the stepson learned of the original savings account in his name and the subsequent switch to the widow's daughter's name.
(Line_0794): If the stepson now sues the bank for $10,000 plus accrued interest, will the action succeed?
(Line_0795): A. Yes, because the stepson was a third-party intended beneficiary of the original widow-bank deposit agreement.
(Line_0796): B. Yes, because the stepson was a constructive assignee of the widow's claim, as depositor, to the savings account.
(Line_0797): C. No, because the stepson never obtained possession of the passbook.
(Line_0798): D. No, because the stepson's right, if any, to the funds on deposit was effectively abrogated by the second widow-bank deposit agreement.
(Line_0799):  
(Line_0800): 92. X--A wealthy widow, wishing to make a substantial and potentially enduring gift to her beloved adult stepson, established with a bank a passbook savings account by an initial deposit of $10,000.
(Line_0801): The passbook was issued by the bank to the widow solely in her own name. That same day, disinterested witnesses being present, she handed the passbook to her stepson and said, "As a token of my love and affection for you, I give you this $10,000 savings account." Shortly thereafter, she changed her mind and wrote her stepson, "I hereby revoke my gift to you of the $10,000 savings account with the bank. Please return my passbook immediately," and signed her name. The stepson received the letter but ignored it, and the widow died unexpectedly a few days later.
(Line_0802): In litigation between the stepson and the widow's estate, which of the following is a correct statement of the parties' rights with respect to the money on deposit with the bank?
(Line_0803): A. The estate prevails, because the widow's gift to the stepson was revocable and was terminated by her death.
(Line_0804): B. The estate prevails, because the widow's gift to the stepson was revocable and was terminated by her express revocation.
(Line_0805): C. The stepson prevails, because he took the widow's claim to the savings account by a gratuitous but effective and irrevocable assignment from the widow.
(Line_0806): D. The stepson prevails, because his failure to reject the gift, even if the assignment was revocable, created an estoppel against the widow and her estate.
(Line_0807):  
(Line_0808): 93. A buyer purchased a used car from a used car dealer. Knowing them to be false, the dealer made the following statements to the buyer prior to the sale:
(Line_0809): Statement 1. This car has never been involved in an accident.
(Line_0810): Statement 2: This car gets 25 miles to the gallon on the open highway.
(Line_0811): Statement 3: This is as smooth-riding a car as you can get.
(Line_0812): If the buyer asserts a claim against the dealer based on deceit, which of the false statements made by the dealer would support the buyer's claim?

(Line_0814): A. Statement 1 only
(Line_0815): B. Statement 2 only
(Line_0816): C. Statements 1 and 2 only
(Line_0817): D. Statements 2 and 3 only

(Line_0819): 94.On October 1, a toy store entered into a written contract with a toy factory for the purchase at $20 per unit of 1,000 mechanical dogs to be specially manufactured by the factory according to the store's specifications. The factory promised to deliver all of the dogs "not later than November 15, for the Yule shopping season," and the store promised to pay the full $20,000 price upon delivery. In order to obtain operating funds, the factory as borrower entered into a written loan agreement on October 5 with a finance company. In relevant part, this agreement recited, "[the factory] hereby transfers and assigns to [the finance company] its [the factory's] October 1 mechanical dog contract with the store, as security for a 50-day loan of $15,000, the advance and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged by [the factory]. . ." No copy of this agreement, or statement relating to it, was filed in an office of public record.
(Line_0820): On October 15, the factory notified the store, "We regret to advise that our master shaft burned out last night because our night supervisor let the lubricant level get too low. We have just fired the supervisor, but the shaft cannot be repaired or replaced until about January 1. We can guarantee delivery of your order, however, not later than January 20." The store rejected this proposal as unacceptable and immediately contracted with the only other available manufacturer to obtain the 1,000 dogs at $30 per unit by November 15.
(Line_0821): On November 1, the store sues the factory for damages and alleges the above facts, except those relating to the factory-finance loan agreement. Upon the factory's motion to dismiss the complaint, the court should
(Line_0822): A. sustain the motion, because the factory on October 15 stated its willingness, and gave assurance of its ability, to perform the contract in January.
(Line_0823): B. sustain the motion, because the store's lawsuit is premature in any case until after November 15.
(Line_0824): C. deny the motion, because the store's complaint alleges an actionable tort by the factory.
(Line_0825): D. deny the motion, because the store's complaint alleges an actionable breach of contract by the factory.

(Line_0827): 95.

The store rejected this proposal as unacceptable and immediately contracted with the only other available manufacturer to obtain the 1,000 dogs at $30 per unit by November 15.
(Line_0829): By November 16, the factory, without legal excuse, has delivered no dogs, and the store has brought an action against the factory. In an action brought on November 16 by the store against the finance company on account of the factory's default, the store can recover

(Line_0831): A. nothing, because the October 5 assignment by the factory to the finance company of the factory's contract was only an assignment for security.
(Line_0832): B. nothing, because no record of the October 5 transaction between the factory and the finance company was publicly filed.
(Line_0833): C. $10,000 damages, because the store was a third-party intended beneficiary of the October 5 transaction between the factory and the finance company.
(Line_0834): D. $10,000 in damages, because the October 5 transaction between the factory and the finance company effected, with respect to the store as creditor, a novation of debtors.

At that time the teenager agreed in writing to pay $400 for the set on July 1 when he would reach his eighteenth birthday. Eighteen is the applicable statutory age of majority, and on that date the teenager was to receive the proceeds of a trust. On July 1, when the reasonable value of the television set was $250, the teenager sent the dealer a signed letter stating, "I'll only pay you $300; that is all the set is worth."
(Line_0837): In an action against the teenager for money damages on July 2, what is the maximum amount that the dealer will be entitled to recover?
(Line_0838): A. Nothing
(Line_0839): B. $250, the reasonable value of the set
(Line_0840): C. $300, the amount the teenager promised to pay in his letter of July 1

X--The inventor of the LBVC, a laser-beam vegetable chopper, ran a television ad that described the chopper and said, "The LBVC is yours for only $49.99 if you send your check or money order to Box 007, Greenville. Not available in stores." The owner of a retail specialty shop, wrote the inventor, "What's your best, firm price for two dozen LBVC's." The inventor sent a written reply that said in its entirety, "We quote you for prompt acceptance $39.99 per unit for 24 LBVC's." The owner of the retail specialty shop subsequently mailed a check to the inventor in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, "I accept your offer for 24 LBVC's."
(Line_0844): A contract would arise from these communications only if
(Line_0845): A. both parties were merchants.
(Line_0846): B. the inventor had at least 24 LBVC's in stock when the owner of the retail specialty shop's check and memo were received.
(Line_0847): C. the owner of the retail specialty shop's check and memo were mailed within three months after his receipt of the inventor's letter.

X-- The inventor of the LBVC, a laser-beam vegetable chopper, ran a television ad that described the chopper and said, "The LBVC is yours for only $49.99 if you send your check or money order to Box 007, Greenville. Not available in stores." The owner of a retail specialty shop, wrote the inventor, "What's your best, firm price for two dozen LBVC's." The inventor sent a written reply that said in its entirety, "We quote you for prompt acceptance $39.99 per unit for 24 LBVC's." The owner of the retail specialty shop subsequently mailed a check to the inventor in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, "I accept your offer for 24 LBVC's."

(Line_0852): The inventor shipped 24 LBVC's to the owner of the retail specialty shop after receiving his check and memo, and with the shipment sent the owner of the retail specialty shop an invoice that conspicuously stated, among other things, the following lawful provision: "These items shall not be offered for resale at retail." The owner of the retail specialty shop received and read but disregarded the invoice restriction and displayed the 24 LBVC's for resale.
(Line_0853): The inventor has a cause of action against the owner of the retail specialty shop for breach of contract only if
(Line_0854): A. The inventor, as inventor of the LBVC, was not a merchant.
(Line_0855): B. the invoice restriction was a material alteration of the pre-existing terms.
(Line_0856): C. the inventor's written reply that quoted $39.99 per LBVC, but did not contain a restriction on retail sales, was not an offer that the owner of the retail specialty shop accepted by ordering 24 LBVC's.
(Line_0857): D. the owner of the retail specialty shop was consciously aware when taking delivery of the goods that the television ad had said, "Not available in stores."

(Line_0859): 99. In a writing signed by both parties, a renowned architect agreed for a fee of $25,000 to design and supervise construction of a new house for a famous sculptor, the fee to be paid upon completion of the house. The architect and sculptor got along poorly, and, when the design plans were about two-thirds complete, they had a heated argument over the proper location of a marble staircase. Hoping to avoid such encounters, the architect, without the sculptor's knowledge, assigned to a newly-licensed architect practicing solo, "all of my rights and duties under my design and construction supervision contract with the sculptor." The newly-licensed architect expressly promised the architect to carry out the work to the best of her ability.
(Line_0860): Assume that the sculptor on learning of the assignment refused to allow the newly-licensed architect to proceed as architect and brought an action against the renowned architect to compel him to resume and complete performance of the contract.
(Line_0861): Is the sculptor entitled to such relief?
(Line_0862): A. Yes, because the renowned architect's services under the contract are unique.
(Line_0863): B. Yes, because the renowned architect has personally completed two-thirds of the design work.
(Line_0864): C. No, because the architect-sculptor contract is one for personal services by the renowned architect.
(Line_0865): D. No, because the renowned architect effectively delegated his remaining duties under the architect-sculptor contract to the newly-licensed architect.
(Line_0866):

The newly-licensed architect expressly promised the renowned architect to carry out the work to the best of her ability.
(Line_0868): Assume that the sculptor allowed the newly-licensed architect to proceed with the design work but that the newly-licensed architect, without legal excuse, abandoned the project shortly after construction began.
(Line_0869): Which of the following legal conclusions are correct?
(Line_0870): I. The renowned architect is liable to the sculptor for legal damages, if any, caused by the newly-licensed architect's default.
(Line_0871): II. The newly-licensed architect is liable to the sculptor for legal damages, if any, caused by her default.
(Line_0872): III. The sculptor is indebted to the newly-licensed architect, on a divisible contract theory, for a prorated portion of the agreed $25,000 architect's fee promised to the renowned architect.

(Line_0878): 101. X-- The German-made Doppelpferd is the most popular automobile in the United States. Its U.S. sales are booming, and the average retail markup in such sales is 30 percent. A franchised Doppelpferd dealer in the United States contracted with a purchaser to sell him a new Doppelpferd for $9,000 cash, the sale to be consummated after delivery to the dealer of the car, which the dealer ordered for the purchaser. The signed retail contractual document was a contract drafted by the dealer's lawyer, and the purchaser did not question or object to any of its terms, including the price inserted by the dealer. When the car arrived from Germany, the purchaser repudiated the contract. The dealer at once sold the car for $9,000 cash to another interested buyer, for whom the dealer had also ordered from the manufacturer a Doppelpferd identical to the purchaser's.
(Line_0879): In an action against the purchaser for breach of contract, the dealer will probably recover
(Line_0880): A. $9,000 minus what it cost the dealer to purchase the car from the manufacturer.
(Line_0881): B. $9,000 minus the wholesale price of an identical Doppelpferd in the local wholesale market among dealers.
(Line_0882): C. nominal damages only, because the dealer resold the car to the other interested buyer without lowering the retail price.
(Line_0883): D. nothing, because the parties' agreement was an adhesion contract and therefore unconscionable.
(Line_0884):  
(Line_0885): 102. On January 1, a builder and a landlowner agreed in writing that the builder would build a house on the landowner's lot according to the landowner's plans and specifications for $60,000, the work to commence on April 1. The landowner agreed to make an initial payment of $10,000 on April 1, and to pay the balance upon completion of the work.
(Line_0886): On February 1, the builder notified the landowner that he (the builder) would lose money on the job at that price and would not proceed with the work unless the landowner would agree to increase the price to $90,000. The landowner thereupon, without notifying the builder, agreed in writing with a third-party for the third-party, commencing April 1, to build the house for $75,000, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done.
(Line_0887): On April 1, both the builder and the third-party showed up at the building site to begin work, the builder telling the landowner that he had decided to "take the loss" and would build the house for $60,000 as originally agreed. The landowner dismissed the builder and allowed the third-party to begin work on the house.
(Line_0888): In a contract action by the builder against the landowner, which of the following would the court decide under the prevailing American view?

(Line_0890): A. The landowner will win, because the builder in legal effect committed a total breach of contract.
(Line_0891): B. The landowner will win, because the third-party's contract price was $15,000 lower than the $90,000 demanded by the builder on February 1.
(Line_0892): C. The builder will win, because the landowner did not tell him before April 1 about the contract with the third-party
(Line_0893): D. The builder will win, because he attempted to perform the contract as originally agreed.
(Line_0894): 103. On January 1, a builder and a landowner agreed in writing that the builder would build a house on the landowner's lot according to the landowner's plans and specifications for $60,000, the work to commence on April 1. The landowner agreed to make an initial payment of $10,000 on April 1, and to pay the balance upon completion of the work.

(Line_0896): On April 1, both the builder and the third-party showed up at the building site to begin work, the builder telling the landowner that he had decided to "take the loss" and would build the house for $60,000 as originally agreed. The landowner dismissed the builder and allowed the third-party to begin work on the house.
(Line_0897): The third-party finished the house on schedule and then showed the landowner that he (the third-party) had spent $85,000 on the job. The landowner thereupon paid the third-party the full balance of their contract price plus an additional $10,000, so that the third-party would not lose money.
(Line_0898): In a contract action by the landowner against the builder, the landowner will recover
(Line_0899): A. the difference between the fair market value of the completed house and the builder's original contract price.
(Line_0900): B. $30,000, the difference between the builder's original contract price and the amount the builder demanded on February 1.
(Line_0901): C. $25,000, the difference between the builder's original contract price and the total amount the landowner paid the third-party for building the house.

(Line_0904): 104. X-- A farmer leased in writing a 100-acre farm from a landowner for five years at $2,000 per year, with an option to purchase "five acres of the land for $10,000 cash" at the end of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the landowner orally promised to have a five-acre parcel surveyed before the end of the lease term. The farmer took possession of the farm and paid the rent for five years. During the fifth year, having decided that he would exercise the purchase option, the farmer planted several fruit trees and built a large grain silo on the property. At the end of the term, the farmer tendered the landowner $10,000 and demanded a conveyance, but the landowner repudiated the option agreement and retook possession of the farm. He had never had the five-acre parcel surveyed.
(Line_0905): In an action by the farmer against the landowner for specific performance of the option agreement, which of the following is the landowner's best defense?
(Line_0906): A. The option part of the agreement is unenforceable because it lacked a separate consideration.
(Line_0907): B. The description of the property to be sold in the parties' written agreement is too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.
(Line_0908): C. The landowner's failure to have the five-acre parcel surveyed was failure of a condition precedent to his own duty of performance.
(Line_0909): D. The option part of the agreement is unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.

(Line_0911): 105.

(Line_0913): The landowner is not liable to the farmer for breach of land-sale contract. In an action by the farmer against the landowner for the reasonable value of the improvements that the farmer added to the farm, which of the following theories would best support the farmer's claim?
(Line_0914): A. Quasi-contract, for benefits inofficiously and non-gratuitously conferred upon the landowner by the farmer
(Line_0915): B. Tort, for conversion by the landowner in retaking possession of the improvements
(Line_0916): C. Breach of trust by the landowner as trustee of a resulting trust of the improvements
(Line_0917): D. Breach by the landowner of an implied-in-fact promise (manifested by his retaking possession of the farm and improvements) to compensate the farmer for the improvements

(Line_0919): 106. X--On January 2, a landowner and a builder entered into a written contract in which the builder agreed to build on the landowner's lot a new house for the landowner, according to plans and specifications furnished by the landowner's architect at a contract price of $200,000. The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $40,000 upon the landowner's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. Further, under a "liquidated damages" clause in the agreement, the builder promised to pay the homeowner $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1. The homeowner, however, told the builder on January 2, before the contract was signed, that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1.
(Line_0920): Because she was overextended on other construction jobs, the builder did not complete the house until October 15. The landowner returned on November 1 as planned and occupied the house. Ten days later, after making the $40,000 final payment to the builder, the landowner learned for the first time that the house had not been completed until October 15.
(Line_0921): If the landowner sues the builder for breach of contract on account of the fifteen-day delay in completion, which of the following will the court probably decide?
(Line_0922): A. The homeowner will recover damages as specified in the contract, i.e., $500 multiplied by fifteen.
(Line_0923): B. The homeowner will recover his actual damages, if any, caused by the delay in completion.
(Line_0924): C. Having waived the delay by occupying the house and making the final payment, the landowner will recover nothing.
(Line_0925): D. The landowner will recover nothing because the contractual completion date was impliedly modified to November 1 when the landowner on January 2 advised the builder about the landowner's prospective trip and return date.
(Line_0926):  
(Line_0927): 107. A high-volume pleasure boat retailer entered into a written contract with a boater, signed by both parties, to sell the boater a power boat for $12,000. The manufacturer's price of the boat delivered to the retailer was $9,500. As the contract provided, the boater paid the retailer $4,000 in advance and promised to pay the full balance upon delivery of the boat. The contract contained no provision for liquidated damages. Prior to the agreed delivery date, the boater notified the retailer that he would be financially unable to conclude the purchase, and the retailer thereupon resold the same boat that the boater had ordered to a third person for $12,000 cash.
(Line_0928): If the boater sues the retailer for restitution of the $4,000 advance payment, which of the following should the court decide?
(Line_0929): A. The boater's claim should be denied, because, as the party in default, he is deemed to have lost any right to restitution of a benefit conferred on the retailer.
(Line_0930): B. The boater's claim should be denied, because, but for his repudiation, the retailer would have made a profit on two boat sales instead of one.
(Line_0931): C. The boater's claim should be upheld in the amount of $4,000 minus the amount of the retailer's lost profit under its contract with the boater.
(Line_0932): D. The boater's claims should be upheld in the amount of $3,500 ($4,000 minus $500 as statutory damages under the UCC).
(Line_0933): 108. X-- A testator, whose nephew was his only heir, died leaving a will that gave his entire estate to charity. The nephew, knowing full well that the testator was of sound mind all of his life, and having no evidence to the contrary, nevertheless filed a suit contesting the testator's will on the ground that the testator was incompetent when the will was signed. The testator's executor, offered the nephew $5,000 to settle the suit, and the nephew agreed.
(Line_0934): If the executor then repudiates the agreement and the foregoing facts are proved or admitted in the nephew's suit against the executor for breach of contract, is the nephew entitled to recover under the prevailing view?
(Line_0935): A. Yes, because the nephew-executor agreement was a bargained for exchange.
(Line_0936): B. Yes, because the law encourages the settlement of disputed claims.
(Line_0937): C. No, because the nephew did not bring the will contest in good faith.
(Line_0938): D. No, because an agreement to oust the court of its jurisdiction to decide a will contest is contrary to public policy.
(Line_0939):  
(Line_0940): 109. On August 1, a geriatric company operating a "lifetime care" home for the elderly admitted an 84-year-old man for a trial period of two months. On September 25, the 84-year-old man and the geriatric company entered into a written lifetime care contract with an effective commencement date of October 1. The full contract price was $20,000, which, as required by the terms of the contract, the 84-year-old man prepaid to the geriatric company on September 25. The 84-year-old man died of a heart attack on October 2.
(Line_0941): In a restitutionary action, can the administratrix of the 84-year-old man's estate, a surviving sister, recover on behalf of the estate either all or part of the $20,000 paid to the geriatric company on September 25?
(Line_0942): A. Yes, because the geriatric company would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the 84-year-old man's expense.
(Line_0943): B. Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.
(Line_0944): C. No, because the 84-year-old man's life span and the duration of the geriatric company's commitment to him was a risk assumed by both parties.
(Line_0945): D. No, but only if the geriatric company can show that between September 25 and the 84-year-old man's death it rejected, because of its commitment to the 84-year-old man, an application for lifetime care from another elderly person.
(Line_0946):  
(Line_0947): 110. X-- The plaintiff, a baseball star, contracted with the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, Inc., to perform for $5,000 at a children's concert as narrator of "Peter and the Wolf." Shortly before the concert, the baseball star became embroiled in a highly publicized controversy over whether he had cursed and assaulted a baseball fan. The orchestra canceled the contract out of concern that attendance might be adversely affected by the baseball star's appearance.
(Line_0948): The baseball star sued the orchestra for breach of contract. His business agent testified without contradiction that the cancellation had resulted in the baseball star's not getting other contracts for performances and endorsements.
(Line_0949): The trial court instructed the jury, in part, as follows: "If you find for the plaintiff, you may award damages for losses which at the time of contracting could reasonably have been foreseen by the defendant as a probable result of its breach. However, the law does not permit recovery for the loss of prospective profits of a new business caused by breach of contract."
(Line_0950): On the baseball star's appeal from a jury verdict for the baseball star, and judgment thereon, awarding damages only of the $5,000 fee promised by the orchestra, the judgment will probably be
(Line_0951): A. affirmed, because the trial court stated the law correctly.
(Line_0952): B. affirmed, because the issue of damages for breach of contract was solely a jury question.
(Line_0953): C. reversed, because the test for limiting damages is what the breaching party could reasonably have foreseen at the time of the breach.
(Line_0954): D. reversed, because under the prevailing modern view, lost profits of a new business are recoverable if they are established with a reasonable certainty.
(Line_0955):  
(Line_0956): 111. Under a written agreement, a pastry company promised to sell its entire output of baked buns at a specified unit price to a baked goods retailer for one year. The baked goods retailer promised not to sell any other supplier's baked buns. Shortly after making the contract, and before the pastry company had tendered any buns, the baked goods retailer decided that the contract had become undesirable because of a sudden, sharp decline in its customers' demand for baked buns. It renounced the agreement and the pastry company sues for breach of contract.
(Line_0957): Which of the following will the court probably decide?
(Line_0958): A. The baked goods retailer wins, because mutuality of obligation was lacking in that the baked goods retailer made no express promise to buy any of the pastry company's baked buns.
(Line_0959): B. The baked goods retailer wins, because the agreement was void for indefiniteness of quantity and total price for the year involved.
(Line_0960): C. The pastry company wins, because the baked goods retailer's promise to sell at retail the pastry company's baked buns exclusively, if it sold any such buns at all, implied a promise to use its best efforts to sell the pastry company's one-year output of baked buns.
(Line_0961): D. The pastry company wins, because under applicable law both parties to a sale-of-goods contract impliedly assume the risk of price and demand fluctuations.
(Line_0962):  
(Line_0963): 112. X-- Under a written agreement, a pastry company promised to sell its entire output of baked buns at a specified unit price to a baked goods retailer for one year. The baked goods retailer promised not to sell any other supplier's baked buns.
(Line_0964): The parties' contract included a provision for termination by either party at any time upon reasonable notice. After six months of performance on both sides, the pastry company, claiming that its old bun-baker had become uneconomical and that it could not afford a new one, dismantled the bun-baker and began using the space for making dog biscuits. The pastry company's output of baked buns having ceased, the baked goods retailer sued for breach of contract. The baked goods retailer moves for summary judgment on liability, and the pastry company moves for summary judgment of dismissal.
(Line_0965): Which of the following should the court rule?
(Line_0966): A. Summary judgment for the baked goods retailer, because as a matter of law the pastry company could not discontinue production of baked buns merely because it was losing money on that product.
(Line_0967): B. Summary judgment for the pastry company, because its cessation of baked-bun production and the baked goods retailer's awareness thereof amounted as a matter of law to valid notice of termination as permitted by the contract.
(Line_0968): C. Both motions denied, because there are triable issues of fact as to whether the the pastry company gave reasonable notice of termination or whether its losses from continued production of baked buns were sufficiently substantial to justify cessation of production.
(Line_0969): D. Both motions denied because the pastry company may legally cease production of baked buns, but under the circumstances it must share with the baked goods retailer its profits from the manufacture of dog biscuits until the end of the first year.

(Line_0971): 113. On July 18, a shovel manufacturer received an order for the purchase of 500 snow shovels from a wholesaler. The wholesaler had mailed the purchase order on July 15. The order required shipment of the shovels no earlier than September 15 and no later than October 15. Typed conspicuously across the front of the order form was the following: "[the wholesaler] reserves the right to cancel this order at any time before September 1." The manufacturer's mailed response, saying "We accept your order," was received by the wholesaler on July 21.
(Line_0972): As of July 22, which of the following is an accurate statement as to whether a contract was formed?
(Line_0973): A. No contract was formed, because of the wholesaler's reservation of the right to cancel.
(Line_0974): B. No contract was formed, because the wholesaler's order was only a revocable offer.
(Line_0975): C. A contract was formed, but prior to September 1 it was terminable at the will of either party.
(Line_0976): D. A contract was formed, but prior to September 1 it was an option contract terminable only at the will of the wholesaler.

The manufacturer's mailed response, saying "We accept your order," was received by the wholesaler on July 21.
(Line_0979): The wholesaler did not cancel the order, and the manufacturer shipped the shovels to the wholesaler on September 15. When the shovels, conforming to the order in all respects, arrived on October 10, the wholesaler refused to accept them.
(Line_0980): Which of the following is an accurate statement as of October 10 after the wholesaler rejected the shovels?
(Line_0981): A. The wholesaler's order for the shovels, even if initially illusory, became a binding promise to accept and pay for them.
(Line_0982): B. The wholesaler's order was an offer that became an option after shipment by the manufacturer.
(Line_0983): C. The wholesaler's right to cancel was a condition subsequent, the failure of which resulted in an enforceable contract.
(Line_0984): D. In view of the wholesaler's right to cancel its order prior to September 1, the shipment of the shovels on September 15 was only an offer by the manufacturer.

(Line_0987): If the boater sues the retailer for restitution of the $4,000 advance payment, which of the following should the court decide?
(Line_0988): A. The boater's claim should be denied, because, as the party in default, he is deemed to have lost any right to restitution of a benefit conferred on the retailer.
(Line_0989): B. The boater's claim should be denied, because, but for his repudiation, the retailer would have made a profit on two boat-sales instead of one.
(Line_0990): C. The boater's claim should be upheld in the amount of $4,000 minus the amount of the retailer's lost profit under its contract with the boater.
(Line_0991): D. The boater's claims should be upheld in the amount of $3,500 ($4,000 minus $500 as statutory damages under the UCC).
(Line_0992):  
(Line_0993): 116. X-- A developer, needing a water well on one of his projects, met several times about the matter with a well driller. Subsequently, the well driller sent a developer an unsigned typewritten form captioned "WELL DRILLING PROPOSAL" and stating various terms the two had discussed but not agreed upon, including a "proposed price of $5,000." The form concluded, "This proposal will not become a contract until signed by you [the developer] and then returned to and signed by me [the well driller]."
(Line_0994): The developer signed the form and returned it to the well driller, who neglected to sign it but promptly began drilling the well at the proposed site on the developer's project. After drilling for two days, the well driller told the developer during one of the developer's daily visits that he would not finish unless the developer would agree to pay twice the price recited in the written proposal. The developer refused, the well driller quit, and the developer hired substitute to drill the well to completion for a price of $7,500.
(Line_0995): In an action by the developer against the well driller for damages, which of the following is the probable decision?
(Line_0996): A. The developer wins, because his signing of the well driller's form constituted an acceptance of an offer by the well driller.
(Line_0997): B. The developer wins, because the well driller's commencement of performance constituted an acceptance by the well driller of an offer by the developer and an implied promise by the well driller to complete the well.
(Line_0998): C. The well driller wins, because he never signed the proposal as required by its terms.
(Line_0999): D. The well driller wins, because his commencement of performance merely prevented the developer from revoking his offer, made on a form supplied by the well driller, and did not obligate the well driller to complete the well.

(Line_1001): 117. A property owner and a landscape architect signed a detailed writing in which the landscape architect agreed to landscape the owner's residential property in accordance with a design prepared by the landscape architect and incorporated in the writing. The owner agreed to pay $10,000 for the work upon its completion. The owner's spouse was not a party to the agreement and had no ownership interest in the premises.
(Line_1002): Shortly before the agreement was signed, the owner and landscape architect orally agreed that the writing would not become binding on either party unless the owner's spouse should approve the landscaping design.
(Line_1003): If the owner's spouse disapproves of the design and the owner refuses to allow the landscape architect to proceed with the work, is evidence of the oral agreement admissible in the landscape architect's action against the owner for breach of contract?
(Line_1004): A. Yes, because the oral agreement required approval by a third party.
(Line_1005): B. Yes, because the evidence shows that the writing was intended to take effect only if the approval occurred.
(Line_1006): C. No, because the parol evidence rule bars evidence of a prior oral agreement even if the latter is consistent with the terms of a partial integration.
(Line_1007): D. No, because the prior oral agreement contradicted the writing by making the parties' duties conditional.
(Line_1008):  
(Line_1009): 118. A property owner and a landscape architect signed a detailed writing in which the landscape architect agreed to landscape the owner's residential property in accordance with a design prepared by the landscape architect and incorporated in the writing. The owner agreed to pay $10,000 for the work upon its completion. The owner's spouse was not a party to the agreement, and had no ownership interest in the premises.
(Line_1010): At the owner's insistence, the written owner-architect agreement contained a provision that neither party would be bound unless the owner's law partner, an avid student of landscaping, should approve the landscape architect's design. Before the landscape architect commenced the work, the owner's law partner, in the presence of both the owner and the landscape architect, expressly disapproved the landscaping design. Nevertheless, the owner ordered the landscape architect to proceed with the work, and the landscape architect reluctantly did so. When the landscape architect's performance was 40% complete, the owner repudiated his duty, if any, to pay the contract price or any part thereof.
(Line_1011): If the landscape architect now sues the owner for damages for breach of contract, which of the following concepts best supports the landscape architect's claim?
(Line_1012): A. Substantial performance.
(Line_1013): B. Promissory estoppel.
(Line_1014): C. Irrevocable waiver of condition.
(Line_1015): D. Unjust enrichment.

(Line_1017): 119. X-- An expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, contracted in a signed writing to lift and emplace certain air-conditioning equipment atop a builder's building. An exculpatory clause in the contract provided that the expert would not be liable for any physical damage to the builder's building occurring during installation of the air-conditioning equipment. There was also a clause providing for per diem damages if the expert did not complete performance by a specified date and a clause providing that "time is of the essence." Another clause provided that any subsequent agreement for extra work under the contract must be in writing and signed by both parties.
(Line_1018): With ample time remaining under the contract for commencement and completion of his performance, the expert notified the builder that he was selling his business to a man who was equally expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, and that the man had agreed to "take over the the expert-builder contract."
(Line_1019): If the builder refuses to accept the man's services, which of the following clauses in the the expert-builder contract will best support the builder's contention that the expert's duties under the contract were not delegable without the builder's consent?

(Line_1021): A. The exculpatory clause.
(Line_1022): B. The liquidated-damage clause.
(Line_1023): C. The "time is of the essence" clause.
(Line_1024): D. The extra-work clause.
(Line_1025):  
(Line_1026): 120. An expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, contracted in a signed writing to lift and emplace certain air-conditioning equipment atop a builder's building. An exculpatory clause in the contract provided that the expert would not be liable for any physical damage to the builder's building occurring during installation of the air-conditioning equipment. There was also a clause providing for per diem damages if the expert did not complete performance by a specified date and a clause providing that "time is of the essence." Another clause provided that any subsequent agreement for extra work under the contract must be in writing and signed by both parties.
(Line_1027): With ample time remaining under the contract for commencement and completion of his performance, the expert notified the builder that he was selling his business to a man who was equally expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, and that the man had agreed to "take over the the expert-builder contract."
(Line_1028): Assume that the builder orally agreed with the expert to accept the man's services and that the man performed on time but negligently installed the wrong air-conditioning equipment.
(Line_1029): Will the builder succeed in an action against the expert for damages for breach of contract?
(Line_1030): A. Yes, because the builder did not agree to release the expert from liability under the expert-builder contract.
(Line_1031): B. Yes, because the builder received no consideration for the substitution of the man for the expert.
(Line_1032): C. No, because by accepting the substitution of the man for the expert, the builder effected a novation, and the expert was thereby discharged of his duties under the expert-builder contract.
(Line_1033): D. No, because the liquidated-damage clause in the expert-builder contract provided only for damages caused by delay in performance.
(Line_1034):  
(Line_1035): 121. X-- The aged mother of a sister and brother, both adults, wished to employ a live-in companion so that she might continue to live in her own home. The mother, however, had only enough income to pay one-half of the companion's $2,000 monthly salary. Learning of their mother's plight, the sister and brother agreed with each other in a signed writing that on the last day of January and each succeeding month during their mother's lifetime, each would give their mother $500. Their mother then hired the companion.
(Line_1036): The siblings made the agreed payments in January, February, and March. In April, however, the brother refused to make any payment and notified his sister and their mother that he would make no further payments.
(Line_1037): There is a valid contract between the siblings, but their mother has declined to sue the brother.
(Line_1038): Will the sister succeed in an action against the brother in which she asks the court to order the brother to continue to make his payments to their mother under the terms of the the sibling's contract?
(Line_1039): A. Yes, because the sister's remedy at law is inadequate.
(Line_1040): B. Yes, because the sister's burden of supporting her mother will be increased if her brother does not contribute his share.
(Line_1041): C. No, because a court will not grant specific performance of a promise to pay money.
(Line_1042): D. No, because the brother's breach of contract has caused no economic harm to the sister.
(Line_1043):  
(Line_1044): 122. X-- A retailer of guns in a state received on June 1 the following signed letter from a gun-wholesaler in another state: "We have just obtained 100 of the assault rifles you inquired about and can supply them for $250 each. We can guarantee shipment no later than August 1."
(Line_1045): On June 10, the wholesaler sold and delivered the same rifles to another merchant for $300 each. Unaware of that transaction, the retailer on the morning of June 11 mailed the wholesaler a letter rejecting the latter's offer, but, changing his mind an hour later, retrieved from his local post office the letter of rejection and immediately dispatched to the wholesaler a letter of acceptance, which the wholesaler received on June 14.
(Line_1046): On June 9, a valid federal statute making the interstate sale of assault rifles punishable as a crime had become effective, but neither the retailer nor the wholesaler was aware until June 15 that the statute was already in effect.
(Line_1047): As between the retailer and the wholesaler, which of the following is an accurate statement?
(Line_1048): A. No contract was formed, because of wholesaler's June 10 sale of the rifles to another merchant revoked the offer to the retailer.
(Line_1049): B. If a contract was formed, it is voidable because of mutual mistake.
(Line_1050): C. If a contract was formed, it is unenforceable because of supervening impracticability.
(Line_1051): D. No contract was formed, because the retailer's June 11 rejection was effective on dispatch.
(Line_1052):  
(Line_1053): 123. A man owed his friend $1,000, plus interest at 8% until paid, on a long-overdue promissory note, collection of which would become barred by the statute of limitations on June 30. On the preceding April 1, the man and his friend both signed a writing in which the man promised to pay the note in full on the following December 31, plus interest at 8% until that date, and the friend promised not to sue on the note in the meantime. The friend, having received some advice from his nonlawyer brother-in-law, became concerned about the legal effect of the April 1 agreement. On May 1, acting pro se as permitted by the rules of the local small claims court, he filed suit to collect the note.
(Line_1054): Assuming that there is no controlling statute, is the April 1 agreement an effective defense for the man?
(Line_1055): A. Yes, because the man's promise to pay interest until December 31 was consideration for the friend's promise not to sue.
(Line_1056): B. Yes, because the law creates a presumption that the man relied on his friend's promise not to sue.
(Line_1057): C. No, because there was no consideration for the friend's promise not to sue, in that the man was already obligated to pay $1,000 plus interest at 8% until the payment date.
(Line_1058): D. No, because the man's April 1 promise is enforceable with or without consideration.
(Line_1059):  
(Line_1060): 124. X-- A man owed his friend $1,000, plus interest at 8% until paid, on a long-overdue promissory note, collection of which would become barred by the statute of limitations on June 30. On the preceding April 1, the man and his friend both signed a writing in which the man promised to pay the note in full on the following December 31, plus interest at 8% until that date, and the friend promised not to sue on the note in the meantime. The friend, having received some advice from his nonlawyer brother-in-law, became concerned about the legal effect of the April 1 agreement. On May 1, acting pro se as permitted by the rules of the local small claims court, he filed suit to collect the note.
(Line_1061): Assume that on January 2 of the following year the friend's suit has not come to trial, the man has not paid the note, the friend has retained a lawyer, and the lawyer, with leave of court, amends the complaint to add a second count to enforce the promise the man made in the April 1 agreement.
(Line_1062): Does the new count state a claim upon which relief can be granted?
(Line_1063): A. Yes, because the man's failure to pay the note, plus interest, on December 31 makes the friend's breach of promise not to sue before that date no longer material.
(Line_1064): B. Yes, because the man's April 1 promise is enforceable by reason of his moral obligation to pay the debt.
(Line_1065): C. No, because such relief would undermine the policy of the statute of limitations against enforcement of stale claims.
(Line_1066): D. No, because the man's April 1 promise was lawfully conditioned upon the friend's forbearing to sue prior to December 31.
(Line_1067):  
(Line_1068): 125.  A father and his adult daughter encountered an old family friend on the street. The daughter said to the family friend, "How about lending me $1,000 to buy a used car? I'll pay you back with interest one year from today." The father added, "And if she doesn't pay it back as promised, I will." The family friend thereupon wrote out and handed to the daughter his personal check, payable to her, for $1,000, and the daughter subsequently used the funds to buy a used car. When the debt became due, both the daughter and the father refused to repay it, or any part of it.
(Line_1069): In an action by the family friend against the father to recover $1,000 plus interest, which of the following statements would summarize the father's best defense?
(Line_1070): A. He received no consideration for his conditional promise to the family friend.
(Line_1071): B. His conditional promise to the family friend was not to be performed in less than a year from the time it was made.
(Line_1072): C. His conditional promise to the family friend was not made for the primary purpose of benefiting himself (the father).
(Line_1073): D. The loan by the family friend was made without any agreement concerning the applicable interest rate.
(Line_1074):  
(Line_1075): 126. A borrower asked a lender to lend her $1,000. The lender replied that he would do so only if the borrower's father would guarantee the loan. At the borrower's request, the father mailed a signed letter to the lender: "If you lend $1,000 to my daughter, I will repay it if she doesn't." On September 15, the lender, having read the father's letter, lent $1,000 to the borrower, which the borrower agreed to repay in installments of $100 plus accrued interest on the last day of each month beginning October 31. The father died on September 16. Later that same day, unaware of the father's death, the lender mailed a letter to the father advising that he had made the $1,000 loan to the borrower on September 15.

(Line_1077): The borrower did not pay the installments due on October 31, November 30, or December 31, and has informed the lender that she will be unable to make repayments in the foreseeable future.
(Line_1078): On January 15, the lender is entitled to a judgment against the borrower for which of the following amounts?
(Line_1079): A. Nothing, because if he sues before the entire amount is due, he will be splitting his cause of action.
(Line_1080): B. $300 plus the accrued interest, because the borrower's breach is only a partial breach.
(Line_1081): C. $1,000 plus the accrued interest, because the borrower's unexcused failure to pay three installments is a material breach.
(Line_1082): D. $1,000 plus the accrued interest, because the failure to pay her debts as they come due indicates that the borrower is insolvent and the lender is thereby entitled to accelerate payment of the debt.
(Line_1083):  
(Line_1084): 127. A borrower asked a lender to lend her $1,000. The lender replied that he would do so only if the borrower's father would guarantee the loan. At the borrower's request the father mailed a signed letter to the lender: "If you lend $1,000 to my daughter, I will repay it if she doesn't." On September 15, the lender having read the father's letter, lent $1,000 to the borrower, which the borrower agreed to repay in installments of $100 plus accrued interest on the last day of each month beginning October 31. The father died on September 16. Later that same day, unaware of the father's death, the lender mailed a letter to the father advising that he had made the $1,000 loan to the borrower on September 15.
(Line_1085): The borrower did not pay the installments due on October 31, November 30, or December 31, and has informed the lender that she will be unable to make repayments in the foreseeable future.
(Line_1086): Assume that the borrower's entire $1,000 debt is due and that she has failed to repay any part of it.
(Line_1087): In an action by the lender against the father's estate for $1,000 plus accrued interest, which of the following, if any, will serve as (an) effective defense(s) for the father's estate?
(Line_1088): I. There was no consideration to support the father's promise, because he did not receive any benefit.
(Line_1089): II. The father died before the lender accepted his offer.
(Line_1090): III. The father died before the lender notified him that his offer had been accepted.
(Line_1091): A. I only.
(Line_1092): B. II only.
(Line_1093): C. I and III only.
(Line_1094): D. Neither I nor II nor III.
(Line_1095):  
(Line_1096): 128. A radio manufacturer and a retailer, after extensive negotiations, entered into a final written agreement in which the manufacturer agreed to sell and the retailer agreed to buy all of its requirements of radios, estimated at 20 units per month, during the period January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990, at a price of $50 per unit. A dispute arose in later December, 1990, when the retailer returned 25 undefective radios to the manufacturer for full credit after the manufacturer had refused to extend the contract for a second three-year period.
(Line_1097): In an action by the manufacturer against the retailer for damages due to return of the 25 radios, the manufacturer introduces the written agreement, which expressly permitted the buyer to return defective radios for credit but was silent as to the return of undefective radios for credit. The retailer seeks to introduce evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned, for various reasons, 125 undefective radios, for which the manufacturer had granted full credit. The manufacturer objects to the admissibility of this evidence.
(Line_1098): The trial court will probably rule that the evidence proffered by the retailer is
(Line_1099): A. inadmissible, because the evidence is barred by the parol evidence rule.
(Line_1100): B. inadmissible, because the express terms of the agreement control when those terms are inconsistent with the course of performance.
(Line_1101): C. admissible, because the evidence supports an agreement that is not within the relevant statute of frauds.
(Line_1102): D. admissible, because course-of-performance evidence, when available, is considered the best indication of what the parties intended the writing to mean.
(Line_1103):  
(Line_1104): 129. A radio manufacturer and a retailer, after extensive negotiations, entered into a final written agreement in which the manufacturer agreed to sell and the retailer agreed to buy all of its requirements of radios, estimated at 20 units per month, during the period January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990, at a price of $50 per unit. A dispute arose in later December, 1990, when the retailer returned 25 undefective radios to the manufacturer for full credit after the manufacturer had refused to extend the contract for a second three-year period.
(Line_1105): In an action by the manufacturer against the retailer for damages due to return of the 25 radios, the manufacturer introduces the written agreement, which expressly permitted the buyer to return defective radios for credit but was silent as to the return of undefective radios for credit. The retailer seeks to introduce evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned, for various reasons, 125 undefective radios, for which the manufacturer had granted full credit. The manufacturer objects to the admissibility of this evidence.
(Line_1106): Assume the following facts. When the retailer returned the 25 radios in question, it included with the shipment a check payable to the manufacturer for the balance admittedly due on all other merchandise sold and delivered to the retailer. The check was conspicuously marked, "Payment in full for all goods sold to the retailer to date." The manufacturer's credit manager, reading this check notation and knowing that the retailer had also returned the 25 radios for full credit, deposited the check without protest in the manufacturer's local bank account. The canceled check was returned to the retailer a week later.
(Line_1107): Which of the following defenses would best serve the retailer?
(Line_1108): A. The manufacturer's deposit of the check and its return to the retailer after payment estopped the manufacturer thereafter from asserting that the retailer owed any additional amount.
(Line_1109): B. By depositing the check without protest and with knowledge of its wording, the manufacturer discharged any remaining duty to pay on the part of the retailer.
(Line_1110): C. By depositing the check without protest and with knowledge of its wording, the manufacturer entered into a novation discharging any remaining duty to pay on the part of the retailer.
(Line_1111): D. The parties' good faith dispute over return of the radios suspended the duty of the retailer, if any, to pay any balance due.

(Line_1113): 130. A woman entered into a contract with a painter, by the terms of which the painter was to paint the woman's office for $1,000 and was required to do all of the work over the following weekend so as to avoid disruption of the woman's business. Assume the following facts. If the painter had started to paint on the following Saturday morning, he could have finished before Sunday evening. However, he stayed home that Saturday morning to watch the final game of the World Series on TV and did not start to paint until Saturday afternoon. By late Saturday afternoon, the painter realized that he had underestimated the time it would take to finish the work over the weekend unless he hired a helper. He also stated that to do so would require an additional charge of $200 for the work. The woman told the painter that she apparently had no choice but to pay "whatever it takes" to get the work done as scheduled.
(Line_1114): The painter hired a friend to help finish the painting and paid the friend $200. The woman has offered to pay the painter $1,000. The painter is demanding $1,200.

(Line_1116): How much is the painter likely to recover?
(Line_1117): A. $1,000 only, because the woman received no consideration for her promise to pay the additional sum.
(Line_1118): B. $1,000 only, because the woman's promise to pay "whatever it takes" is too uncertain to be enforceable.
(Line_1119): C. $1,200, in order to prevent the woman's unjust enrichment.
(Line_1120): D. $1,200, because the impossibility of the painter's completing the work alone discharged the original contract and a new contract was formed.
(Line_1121):  
(Line_1122): 131. A business owner entered into a contract with a painter, by the terms of which the painter was to paint the owner's office for $1,000 and was required to do all of the work over the following weekend so as to avoid disruption of the owner's business.
(Line_1123): Assume the following facts. The painter commenced work on Saturday morning and had finished half the painting by the time he quit work for the day. That night, without the fault of either party, the office building was destroyed by fire.
(Line_1124): Which of the following is an accurate statement?
(Line_1125): A. Both parties' contractual duties are discharged, and the painter can recover nothing from the owner.
(Line_1126): B. Both parties' contractual duties are discharged, but the painter can recover in quasi-contract from the owner.
(Line_1127): C. Only the painter's contractual duty is discharged, because the owner's performance (payment of the agreed price) is not impossible.
(Line_1128): D. Only the painter's contractual duty is discharged, and the painter can recover his reliance damages from the owner.
(Line_1129):  
(Line_1130): 132. A seller and a buyer, standing on Greenacre, orally agreed to its sale and purchase for $5,000 and orally marked its bounds as "that line of trees down there, the ditch that intersects them, the fence on the other side, and that street on the fourth side."
(Line_1131): In which of the following is the remedy of reformation most appropriate?
(Line_1132): A. As later reduced to writing, the agreement by clerical mistake included two acres that are actually beyond the fence.
(Line_1133): B. The buyer reasonably thought that two acres beyond the fence were included in the oral agreement but the seller did not. As later reduced to writing, the agreement included the two acres.
(Line_1134): C. The buyer reasonably thought that the price orally agreed upon was $4,500, but the seller did not. As later reduced to writing, the agreement said $5,000.
(Line_1135): D. The buyer reasonably thought that a dilapidated shed backed up against the fence was to be torn down and removed as part of the agreement, but the seller did not. As later reduced to writing, the agreement said nothing about the shed.
(Line_1136):  
(Line_1137): 133. A buyer ordered from a seller 500 bushels of No. 1 Royal Fuzz peaches, at a specified price, "for prompt shipment." The seller promptly shipped 500 bushels, but by mistake shipped No. 2 Royal Fuzz peaches instead of No. 1. The error in shipment was caused by the negligence of the seller's shipping clerk.
(Line_1138): Which of the following best states the buyer's rights and duties upon delivery of the peaches?
(Line_1139): A. The seller's shipment of the peaches was a counteroffer and the buyer can refuse to accept them.
(Line_1140): B. The seller's shipment of the peaches was a counteroffer but, since peaches are perishable, the buyer, if it does not want to accept them, must reship the peaches to the seller in order to mitigate the seller's losses.
(Line_1141): C. The buyer must accept the peaches because a contract was formed when the seller shipped them.
(Line_1142): D. Although a contract was formed when the seller shipped the peaches, the buyer does not have to accept them.
(Line_1143):  
(Line_1144): 134. X-- A debtor's $1,000 contractual obligation to a creditor was due on July 1. On the preceding June 15, the creditor called her niece and said, "As my birthday gift to you, you may collect on July 1 the $1,000 the debtor owes me." The creditor also called the debtor and told him to pay the $1,000 to the niece on July 1. On July 1, the debtor, saying that he did not like the niece and wouldn't pay anything to her, paid the $1,000 to the creditor, who accepted it without objection.
(Line_1145): Will the niece succeed in an action for $1,000 against the debtor?
(Line_1146): A. Yes, because the creditor had effectively assigned the $1,000 debt to her.
(Line_1147): B. Yes, because the creditor's calls to the niece and the debtor effected a novation.
(Line_1148): C. No, because the creditor's acceptance of the $1,000, without objection, was in effect the revocation of a gratuitous assignment.
(Line_1149): D. No, because the debtor cannot be compelled to render performance to an assignee whom he finds personally objectionable.

(Line_1151): 135. X-- A rancher and a fancier of horses signed the following writing: "For $5,000, the rancher will sell to the fancier a gray horse that the fancier may choose from among the grays on the rancher's ranch."
(Line_1152): The fancier refused to accept delivery of a gray horse timely tendered by the rancher or to choose among those remaining, on the ground that during their negotiations the rancher had orally agreed to include a saddle, worth $100, and also to give the fancier the option to choose a gray or a brown horse. The fancier insisted on one of the rancher's brown horses, but the rancher refused to part with any of his browns or with the saddle as demanded by the fancier.
(Line_1153): If the fancier sues the rancher for damages and seeks to introduce evidence of the alleged oral agreement, the court probably will
(Line_1154): A. admit the evidence as to both the saddle and the option to choose a brown horse.
(Line_1155): B. admit the evidence as to the saddle but not the option to choose a brown horse.
(Line_1156): C. admit the evidence as to the option to choose a brown horse but not the promise to include the saddle.
(Line_1157): D. not admit any of the evidence.
(Line_1158):  
(Line_1159): 136. X--A landowner contracted in a signed writing to sell Greenacre, a 500-acre tract of farmland, to a farmer. The contract provided for exchange of the deed and purchase price of $500,000 in cash on January 15. Possession was to be given to the farmer on the same date. On January 15, the landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30, the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then, but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. When the landowner tendered the deed and possession on January 30, the farmer refused to accept either, and refused to pay the $500,000. Throughout the month of January, the market value of Greenacre was $510,000, and its fair monthly rental value was $5,000.
(Line_1160): Will the landowner probably succeed in an action against the farmer for specific performance?
(Line_1161): A. Yes, because the court will excuse the delay in tender on the ground that there was a temporary impossibility caused by the tenant's holding over.
(Line_1162): B. Yes, because time is ordinarily not of the essence in a land-sale contract.
(Line_1163): C. No, because the landowner breached by failing to tender the deed and possession on January 15.
(Line_1164): D. No, because the landowner's remedy at law for monetary relief is adequate.
(Line_1165):  
(Line_1166): 137. A landowner contracted in a signed writing to sell Greenacre, a 500-acre tract of farmland, to a farmer. The contract provided for exchange of the deed and purchase price of $500,000 in cash on January 15. Possession was to be given to the farmer on the same date. On January 15, landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30, the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then, but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. Throughout the month of January, the market value of Greenacre was $510,000, and its fair monthly rental value was $5,000.
(Line_1167): On January 30, the farmer accepted a conveyance and possession of Greenacre and paid the $500,000 purchase price, but notified the landowner that he was reserving any rights he might have to damages caused by the landowner's breach. The farmer intended to use the land for raising cattle and had entered into a contract for the purchase of 500 head of cattle to be delivered to Greenacre on January 15. Because he did not have possession of Greenacre on that date, he had to rent another pasture at a cost of $2,000 to graze the cattle for 15 days. The landowner had no reason to know that the farmer intended to use Greenacre for raising cattle or that he was purchasing cattle to be grazed on Greenacre.
(Line_1168): In an action by the farmer against the landowner for damages, the farmer is entitled to recover
(Line_1169): A. nothing, because by paying the purchase price on January 30, he waived whatever cause of action he may have had.
(Line_1170): B. nominal damages only, because the market value of the land exceeded the contract price.
(Line_1171): C. $2,500 only (the fair rental value of Greenacre for 15 days).
(Line_1172): D. $2,500 (the fair rental value of Greenacre for 15 days), plus $2,000 (the cost of grazing the cattle elsewhere for 15 days).
(Line_1173):  
(Line_1174): 138. On December 1, a broker contracted with a collector to sell her one of a certain type of rare coin for $12,000, delivery and payment to occur on the next March 1. To fulfill that contract, and without the collector's knowledge, the broker contracted on January 1 to purchase for $10,000 a specimen of that type of coin from a hoarder, delivery and payment to occur on February 1. The market price of such coins had unexpectedly fallen to $8,000 by February 1, when the hoarder tendered the coin and the broker repudiated.
(Line_1175): On February 25, the market in such coins suddenly reversed and had stabilized at $12,000 on March 1. The broker, however, had failed to obtain a specimen of the coin and repudiated his agreement with the collector when she tendered the $12,000 agreed price on March 1.
(Line_1176): Later that day, after learning by chance of the broker's dealing with the collector, the hoarder telephoned the collector and said: "Listen, the broker probably owes me at least $2,000 in damages for refusing wrongfully to buy my coin for $10,000 on February 1 when the market was down to $8,000. But I'm in good shape in view of the market's recovery since then, and I think you ought to get after the so-and-so."
(Line_1177): If the collector immediately sues the broker for his breach of the broker-hoarder contract, which of the following will the court probably decide?
(Line_1178): A. The broker wins, because the collector, if a beneficiary at all of the broker-hoarder contract, was only an incidental beneficiary.
(Line_1179): B. The broker wins, because as of March 1 neither the hoarder nor the collector had sustained any damage from the broker's repudiation of both contracts.
(Line_1180): C. The collector wins, because she was an intended beneficiary of the broker-hoarder contract, under which damages for the broker's repudiation became fixed on February 1.
(Line_1181): D. The collector wins, because she took an effective assignment of the hoarder's claim for damages against the broker when the hoarder suggested that the collector "get after the so-and-so."
(Line_1182):  139. X-- For an agreed price of $20 million, a builder contracted with a property owner to design and build on the property owner's commercial plot a 15-story office building. In excavating for the foundation and underground utilities, the builder encountered a massive layer of granite at a depth of 15 feet. By reasonable safety criteria, the building's foundation required a minimum excavation of 25 feet. When the contract was made, neither the property owner nor the builder was aware of the subsurface granite, for the presence of which neither party had hired a qualified expert to test.
(Line_1183): Claiming accurately that removal of enough granite to permit the construction as planned would cost him an additional $3 million and a probable net loss on the contract of $2 million, the builder refused to proceed with the work unless the property owner would promise to pay an additional $2.5 million for the completed building.
(Line_1184): If the property owner refuses and sues the builder for breach of contract, which of the following will the court probably decide?
(Line_1185): A. The builder is excused under the modern doctrine of supervening impossibility, which includes severe impracticability.
(Line_1186): B. The builder is excused, because the contract is voidable on account of the parties' mutual mistake concerning an essential underlying fact.
(Line_1187): C. The property owner prevails, because the builder assumed the risk of encountering subsurface granite that was unknown to the property owner.
(Line_1188): D. The property owner prevails, unless subsurface granite was previously unknown anywhere in the vicinity of the property owner's construction site.
(Line_1189):  
(Line_1190): 140. X-- A notorious spendthrift, who was usually broke for that reason, received the following letter from his uncle, a wealthy and prudent man: "I understand you're in financial difficulties again. I promise to give you $5,000 on your birthday next month, but you'd better use it wisely or you'll never get another dime from me." The spendthrift thereupon signed a contract with a car dealer to purchase a $40,000 automobile and to make a $5,000 down payment on the day after his birthday.
(Line_1191): If the spendthrift sues his uncle for $5,000 after the latter learned of the car-purchase contract and then repudiated his promise, which of the following is the uncle's best defense?
(Line_1192): A. A promise to make a gift in the future is not enforceable.
(Line_1193): B. Reliance by the promisee on a promise to make a future gift does not make the promise enforceable unless the value of the promised gift is substantially equivalent to the promisee's loss by reliance.
(Line_1194): C. Reliance by the promisee on a promise to make a future gift does not make the promise enforceable unless that reliance also results in an economic benefit to the promisor.
(Line_1195): D. Reliance by the promisee on a promise to make a future gift does not make the promise enforceable unless injustice can be avoided only by such enforcement.

(Line_1197): 141. X-- A wallpaper hanger sent a general contractor, this telegram:
(Line_1198): Will do all paperhanging on new Doctors' Building, per owner's specs, for $14,000 if you accept within reasonable time after main contract awarded.
(Line_1199): /s/ the wallpaper hanger
(Line_1200): Three other competing hangers sent the general contractor similar bids in the respective amounts of $18,000, $19,000, and $20,000. The general contractor used the wallpaper hanger's $14,000 figure in preparing and submitting her own sealed bid on Doctors' Building. Before the bids were opened, the wallpaper hanger truthfully advised the general contractor that the former's telegraphic sub-bid had been based on a $4,000 computational error and was therefore revoked. Shortly thereafter, the general contractor was awarded the Doctors' Building construction contract and subsequently contracted with another paperhanger for a price of $18,000. The general contractor now sues the wallpaper hanger to recover $4,000.
(Line_1201): Which of the following, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor's prospect of recovery?
(Line_1202): A. After the wallpaper hanger's notice of revocation, the general contractor made a reasonable effort to subcontract with another paperhanger at the lowest possible price.
(Line_1203): B. The general contractor had been required by the owner to submit a bid bond and could not have withdrawn or amended her bid on the main contract without forfeiting that bond.
(Line_1204): C. The wallpaper hanger was negligent in erroneously calculating the amount of his sub-bid.
(Line_1205): D. The general contractor dealt with all of her subcontractors in good faith and without seeking to renegotiate (lower) the prices they had bid.
(Line_1206):  
(Line_1207): 142. A wallpaper hanger sent a general contractor, this telegram:
(Line_1208): Will do all paperhanging on new Doctors' Building, per owner's specs, for $14,000 if you accept within reasonable time after main contract awarded.

The general contractor now sues the wallpaper hanger to recover $4,000.
(Line_1211): Which of the following, if proved, would best support the wallpaper hanger's defense?
(Line_1212): A. The general contractor gave the wallpaper hanger no consideration for an irrevocable sub-bid.
(Line_1213): B. The wallpaper hanger's sub-bid expressly requested the general contractor's acceptance after awarding of the main contract.
(Line_1214): C. Even after paying $18,000 for the paperhanging, the general contractor would make a net profit of $100,000 on the Doctors' Building contract.
(Line_1215): D. Before submitting her own bid, the general contractor had reason to suspect that the wallpaper hanger had made a computational mistake in figuring his sub-bid.
(Line_1216):  
(Line_1217): 143. For several weeks, a wealthy, unemployed widow, and Nirvana Motors, Inc., negotiated unsuccessfully over the purchase price of a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce Sedan, which, as Nirvana knew, the widow wanted her son to have as a wedding gift. On April 27, Nirvana sent the widow a signed, dated memo saying, "If we can arrive at the same price within the next week, do we have a deal?" The widow wrote "Yes" and her signature at the bottom of his memo and delivered it back to Nirvana on April 29.
(Line_1218): On May 1, the widow wrote Nirvana a signed letter offering to buy "one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1." By coincidence, Nirvana wrote the widow a signed letter on May 1 offering to sell her "one new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1." These letters crossed in the mail and were respectively received and read by the widow and Nirvana on May 2.

(Line_1220): On May 4, the widow and Nirvana Motors both signed a single document evidencing a contract for the sale by Nirvana to the widow, "as a wedding gift for the widow's son," a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan, under the same terms as previously stated in their correspondence. On May 5, the widow handed the son a carbon copy of this document. In reliance on the prospective gift, the son on May 20, sold his nearly new Cheetah (an expensive sports car) to a dealer at a "bargain" price of $50,000 and immediately informed the widow and Nirvana that he had done so.
(Line_1221): On May 25, however, the widow and Nirvana Motors by mutual agreement rescinded in a signed writing "any and all agreements heretofore made between the undersigned parties for the sale-and-purchase of a new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan." Later that day, Nirvana sold for $190,000 cash to another buyer the only new Mark XX Rolls-Royce that it had in stock or could readily obtain elsewhere. On June 1, the son tendered $180,000 in cash to Nirvana Motors and demanded delivery to him "within a reasonable time" of new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment.
(Line_1222): Nirvana rejected the tender and denied any obligation.
(Line_1223): If the son sues Nirvana for breach of contract, which of the following will the court probably decide?
(Line_1224): A. The son wins, because his rights as an assignee for value of the May 4 Widow-Nirvana contract cannot be cut off by agreement between the original parties.
(Line_1225): B. The son wins, because his rights as a third-party intended beneficiary became vested by his prejudicial reliance in selling his Cheetah on May 20.
(Line_1226): C. Nirvana wins, because the son, if an intended beneficiary at all of the Widow-Nirvana contract, was only a donee beneficiary.
(Line_1227): D. Nirvana wins, because it reasonably and prejudicially relied on its contract of mutual rescission with the widow by selling the only readily available new Mark XX Rolls-Royce sedan to another buyer.

(Line_1229): 144. On June 1, a widget manufacturer entered into a written agreement with a tool maker in which the tool maker agreed to produce and sell to the manufacturer 12 sets of newly designed dies to be delivered August 1 for the price of $50,000, payable ten days after delivery. Encountering unexpected expenses in the purchase of special alloy steel required for the dies, the tool maker advised the manufacturer that production costs would exceed the contract price; and on July 1, the manufacturer and the tool maker signed a modification to the June 1 agreement increasing the contract price to $60,000. After timely receipt of 12 sets of dies conforming to the contract specifications, the manufacturer paid the tool maker $50,000 but refused to pay more.
(Line_1230): Which of the following concepts of the Uniform Commercial Code, dealing expressly with the sale of goods, best supports an action by the tool maker to recover $10,000 for breach of the manufacturer's July 1 promise?
(Line_1231): A. Bargained-for exchange.
(Line_1232): B. Promissory estoppel.
(Line_1233): C. Modification of contracts without consideration.
(Line_1234): D. Unconscionability in the formation of contracts.

(Line_1236): 145. X-- A construction company contracted with a warehouse owner to construct for $500,000 a warehouse and an access driveway at highway level. Shortly after commencing work on the driveway, which required for the specified level some excavation and removal of surface material, the construction company unexpectedly encountered a large mass of solid rock.
(Line_1237): The construction company informed the warehouse owner (accurately) that because of the rock, the driveway as specified would cost at least $20,000 more than figured, and demanded that for that reason a total contract price of $520,000. Since the warehouse owner was expecting warehousing customers immediately after the agreed completion date, he signed a writing promising to pay the additional $20,000. Following timely completion of the warehouse and driveway, which conformed to the contract in all respects, the warehouse owner refused to pay the construction company more than $500,000.
(Line_1238): What is the maximum amount to which the construction company is entitled?
(Line_1239): A. $500,000, because there was no consideration for warehouse owner's promise to pay the additional $20,000.
(Line_1240): B. $500,000, because the warehouse owner's promise to pay the additional $20,000 was exacted under duress.
(Line_1241): C. $520,000, because modification was fair and was made in the light of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the original contract was made.
(Line_1242): D. $520,000, provided that the reasonable value of the construction company's total performance was that much or more.

(Line_1244): 146. X-- A construction company contracted with a warehouse owner to construct for $500,000 a warehouse and an access driveway at highway level. Shortly after commencing work on the driveway, which required for the specified level some excavation and removal of surface material, the construction company unexpectedly encountered a large mass of solid rock.
(Line_1245): Upon encountering the rock formation, the construction company, instead of incurring additional costs to remove it, built the access driveway over the rock with a steep grade down to the highway. The warehouse owner, who was out of town for several days, was unaware of this nonconformity until the driveway had been finished. As built, it is too steep to be used safely by trucks or cars, particularly in the wet or icy weather frequently occurring in the area. It would cost $30,000 to tear out and rebuild the driveway at highway level. As built, the warehouse, including the driveway, has a fair market value of $550,000. The warehouse owner has paid $470,000 to the construction company, but refuses to pay more because of the nonconforming driveway, which the construction company has refused to tear out and rebuild.
(Line_1246): If the construction company sues the warehouse owner for monetary relief, what is the maximum amount that the construction company is entitled to recover?
(Line_1247): A. $30,000, because the fair market value of the warehouse and driveway "as is" exceeds the contract price by $50,000 (more than the cost of correcting the driveway).
(Line_1248): B. $30,000, because the construction company substantially performed and the cost of correcting the driveway would involve economic waste.
(Line_1249): C. $30,000, minus whatever amount the construction company saved by not building the driveway at the specified level.
(Line_1250): D. Nothing, because the warehouse owner is entitled to damages for the cost of correcting the driveway.
(Line_1251):  
(Line_1252): 147. X-- Responding to the county's written advertisement for bids, a tire salesman was the successful bidder for the sale of tires to the county for the county's vehicles. The tire salesman and the county entered into a signed, written agreement that specified, "It is agreed that the tire salesman will deliver all tires required by this agreement to the county in accordance with the attached bid form and specifications, for a one-year period beginning September 1, 1990." Attached to the agreement was a copy of the bid form and specifications. In the written advertisement to which the tire salesman had responded, but not in the bid form, the county had stated, "Multiple awards may be issued if they are in the best interests of the county." No definite quantity of tires to be bought by the county from the tire salesman was specified in any of these documents.
(Line_1253): In January 1991, the tire salesman learned that the county was buying some of its tires from one of the tire salesman's competitors. Contending that the tire salesman-county agreement was a requirements contract, the tire salesman sued the county for the damages caused by the county buying some of its tires from the competitor.
(Line_1254): If the county defends by offering proof of the advertisement concerning the possibility of multiple awards, should the court admit the evidence?
(Line_1255): A. Yes, because the provision in the written agreement, "all tires required by this agreement," is ambiguous.
(Line_1256): B. Yes, because the advertisement was in writing.
(Line_1257): C. No, because of the parol evidence rule.
(Line_1258): D. No, because it would make the contract illusory.

(Line_1262): If the court concludes that the tire salesman-county contract is an agreement by the county to buy its tire requirements from the tire salesman, the tire salesman probably will
(Line_1263): A. recover under the contracts clause of the United States Constitution.
(Line_1264): B. recover under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.
(Line_1265): C. not recover, because the agreement lacks mutuality of obligation.
(Line_1266): D. not recover, because the agreement is indefinite as to quantity.

(Line_1268): 149. An automobile retailer had an adult daughter who needed a car in her employment but had only $3,000 with which to buy one. The retailer wrote to his daughter, "Give me your $3,000 and I'll give you the car on our lot that we have been using as a demonstrator." The daughter thanked her father and paid him the $3,000. As both the retailer and his daughter knew, the demonstrator was reasonably worth $10,000. After the daughter had paid the $3,000, but before the car had been delivered to her, one of retailer's sales staff sold and delivered the same car to a customer for $10,000. Neither the salesperson nor the customer was aware of the transaction between the retailer and his daughter.
(Line_1269): Does the daughter, after rejecting a tendered return of the $3,000 by her father, have an action against him for breach of contract?
(Line_1270): A. Yes, because the retailer's promise was supported by bargained-for consideration.
(Line_1271): B. Yes, because retailer's promise was supported by the moral obligation a father owes his child as to the necessities of modern life.
(Line_1272): C. No, because the payment of $3,000 was inadequate consideration to support the retailer's promise.
(Line_1273): D. No, because the salesperson's delivery of the car to the customer made it impossible for the retailer to perform.
(Line_1274):  
(Line_1275): 150.  An owner and operator of a small business encourages "wellness" on the part of his employees and supports various physical-fitness programs to that end. Learning that one of his employees was a dedicated jogger, the business owner promised to pay her a special award of $100 if she could and would run one mile in less than six minutes on the following Saturday. The employee thanked him and did in fact run a mile in less than six minutes on the day specified. Shortly thereafter, however, the business owner discovered that for more than a year the employee had been running at least one mile in less than six minutes every day as a part of her personal fitness program. He refused to pay the $100.

(Line_1277): In an action by the employee against the business owner for breach of contract, which of the following best summarizes the probable decision of the court?
(Line_1278): A. The business owner wins, because it is a compelling inference that his promise did not induce the employee to run the specified mile.
(Line_1279): B. The business owner wins, because the employee's running of the specified mile was beneficial, not detrimental, to her in any event.
(Line_1280): C. The employee wins, because running a mile in less than six minutes is a significantly demanding enterprise.
(Line_1281): D. The employee wins, because she ran the specified mile as requested, and her motives for doing so are irrelevant.





(Line_2381): 1. Answer C is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a contractor's material breach of contract may justify the owner from withholding performance. However, if the contractor has substantially performed on the contract, the owner is still obligated to perform. Therefore, the owner's refusal to pay any of the amount due under the contract would be a total breach. A and B are incorrect because the owner's refusal to pay would not be a partial breach. D is incorrect because if the contractor had not substantially performed, the owner would be justified in withholding performance.
(Line_2382): 2. Answer C is correct. A promise to settle a claim may be consideration to support a return promise so long as there is a good faith dispute over the validity of the claim. The owner's June 18th letter, together with his check for $1,800 with the notation "payment in full" is an offer of accord and satisfaction. The contractor accepted this offer when he retained and cashed the check without objection. In doing so, he impliedly promised to repaint the porch.
(Line_2383): 3. Answer A is correct. A promise to settle a claim may be consideration to support a return promise so long as there is a good faith dispute over the validity of the claim. The owner's June 18 letter, read in conjunction with the $1,800 check marked "payment in full," is an offer of accord and satisfaction which was accepted when the contractor cashed the check. The contractor's implicit promise to repaint the porch was supported by consideration - the owner's promise to settle the claim for $1,800. When the contractor cashed the check marked "Payment in full as per letter dated June 18," he implicitly accepted the accord (the offer to settle for $1,800 in exchange for the promise to repaint).
(Line_2384): 4. Answer D is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's material breach of an obligation, if uncured, may discharge the other party's obligation under the contract. Therefore, the agent's obligation may only be discharged if the actress's inability to perform for one week is found to be a material breach. Whether the breach will be found to be material will depend on a number of factors, including the prospect that the actress may cure the breach, whether damages are available to compensate the agent for the harm suffered and the degree to which the actress's failure to perform substantially deprived the agent of his expected benefit under the contract. If the actress is found not to have materially breached, then the agent's failure to accept her services for the remainder of the engagement would in turn be found to be a material breach.
(Line_2385): 5. Answer A is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's material breach of an obligation, if uncured, may have the effect of discharging the other party's obligation under the contract. Therefore, the agent's obligation may only be discharged if the actress's inability to perform for one week is found to be a material breach. Whether the breach will be found to be material will depend on a number of factors, including the prospect that the actress will cure the breach, whether damages are available to compensate the agent for the harm suffered and the degree to which the actress's failure to perform substantially deprived the agent of his expected benefit under the contract. The fact that the agent could only find a replacement who demanded a six-month contract speaks to the extent of the loss to the agent due to the actress's absence, and suggests that he was justified in withholding his own performance
(Line_2386): 6. Answer D is correct. Under the statute of frauds, promises made to answer for the debt of another generally fall within the suretyship clause of the statute and therefore must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute. However, the suretyship clause does not apply where the surety promise was made to the principal (seller) and not to the obligee (the creditor). Contracts for the sale of an interest in land fall within the statute of frauds as well. The promise that the creditor is seeking to enforce, however, is not part of a contract for the sale of an interest in land but rather a promise to repay a $25,000 debt owed to the creditor by the seller. Therefore neither of the two statements is correct.
(Line_2387): 7. Answer A is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). The buyer and the seller entered into a final written agreement that was silent with respect to the verbal promise that the creditor seeks to enforce (the buyer's promise to repay the seller's debt). Because the writing was silent with respect to this, in effect the creditor seeks to supplement rather than contradict the writing with extrinsic evidence of the promise. Whether or not the promise will be admissible hinges on whether the writing is completely or only partially integrated.
(Line_2388): 8. Answer B is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise, such as where the promisor knows that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary unless and until the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if he manifests assent to or materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise before receiving notice of the discharge. Since the promise at issue is the buyer's promise to pay $25,000 "to the creditor," it appears that the creditor is an intended beneficiary, since the performance flows directly to him. But if the buyer and seller later agreed not to pay any of the purchase price to the creditor, this agreement would modify the March 1 agreement, and if it were done before the creditor was aware of the existence of the agreement, it would be effective in discharging the creditor's rights as intended beneficiary.
(Line_2389): 9. Answer C is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of evidence of an agreement made prior to the adoption of a final writing if the prior agreement relates to matters within the scope of that writing. Where a clerical error has been made in reducing an agreement to writing, however, a party may bring an action in equitable reformation to have the writing reformed to correct the error or to include an omitted provision, and the parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence to show the mistake that forms the basis for reformation. Therefore, if the buyer and the seller verbally agreed that the buyer would pay $46,000 in exchange for Homestead but the writing stated $45,000 due to an error in transcription, the seller may seek to have the writing reformed on grounds of mistake.
(Line_2390): 10. Answer C is correct. A bona fide purchaser for value is one who takes without notice before delivery of conveyance or payment of the purchase price and is protected as to reasonable expectations arising from the apparent ownership of his assignor. Although the neighbor knew of the $1,500 price differential, this was insufficient to put him on reasonable notice that he should inquire regarding the purchaser's ownership interest in Lot 25. Thus, the landowner would be estopped from claiming superior title to the neighbor, a bona fide purchaser.
(Line_2391): 11. Answer A is correct. A promise must be bargained for to create an enforceable contract. The woman provided no consideration for the father's gratuitous promise to pay for her losses resulting from the accident. B is incorrect because even if the father's mistake of law is treated as a part of the total state of facts at the time he made the promise, he would bear the risk of mistake and enforcement of his promise would not be unconscionable. C is incorrect because the father's promise does not fall within one of the categories of contracts required to be in writing. It could be performed in one year, and it is not a suretyship agreement; the father thought he was liable, not his son. D is incorrect because a promise is sufficiently definite if it provides a basis for determining breach and for giving a remedy. Although the father's promise to pay for "any losses" is vague, when read in conjunction with the limiting language "as a result of the accident," judicial construction for breach remains possible.
(Line_2392): 12. Answer C is correct. Because the father's promise to pay the physician was made before the physician began treating the woman, there is no problem with past consideration regarding the physician's services and the physician's care of the woman. It makes no difference that the physician's consideration is conferred upon a third party. Thus, number I is correct.
(Line_2393): 13. Answer D is correct. In order for a promise to be supported by consideration, the consideration must be bargained-for, or sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. As long as the consideration is bargained-for, it is immaterial whether it was furnished by the promisee or by a third person. Therefore the physician's promise is enforceable despite the fact that the father furnished the consideration for the physician's promise to treat the woman (therefore statement I is incorrect). Although the woman was not a party to the father-physician contract, she may enforce the contract as a third-party beneficiary if recognition of such a right in her is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties. This intention seems to be present, since the physician's obligation (to "take care of the woman") flows directly to her (therefore statement II is incorrect). Because statements I and II are both incorrect, A, B and C are incorrect as well.
(Line_2394): 14. Answer B is correct. The father sought the creditor's forbearance in exchange for the father's promise to pay the creditor. It makes no difference that the creditor's consideration would be conferred upon a third party and not upon the father.
(Line_2395): 15. Answer C is correct. Unilateral modifications of contractual obligations lack consideration under the preexisting duty rule and therefore may be unenforceable. However, a promise to surrender a legal claim is sufficient consideration to support a return promise even if the claim turns out to be invalid, so long as the person surrendering the claim has a good faith belief in its validity. Although the creditor may argue that the settlement agreement is unenforceable under the preexisting duty rule, the father will argue that his agreement to settle the claim against the creditor furnished sufficient consideration because he held a genuine belief that the creditor had no legal right against him to collect $200.
(Line_2396): 16. Answer B is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to interpret an ambiguity in the writing. The department store seeks to introduce in litigation extrinsic evidence of a prior oral agreement by the computer programming company to coordinate its computer program with the department store’s methods of accounting. Since the written memo between the parties is silent with respect to this issue, the evidence should be admissible so long as the writing is found to be partially and not completely integrated. The fact that the writing is only two sentences long and does not contain a merger clause suggests that the memo was only partially integrated, and therefore the department store should be successful in introducing the evidence.
(Line_2397): 17. Answer D is correct. Where a party's obligation is subject to a constructive condition, that party remains obligated to perform so long as the other party to the contract substantially performed. However, if the obligation is subject to an express condition, the condition must be completely satisfied; if the condition is not satisfied in all respects then the obligation that is subject to the condition will be excused. The department store’s obligation to pay $20,000 is subject to an express condition, since it agrees to pay only "if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time." The department store is not obligated to pay any portion of the purchase price unless and until the condition is satisfied. Because of the existence of the express condition, the language "within one month of completion" cannot reasonably be construed to require payment before completion has occurred.
(Line_2398): 18. Answer A is correct. The UCC controls for a sale of goods and, because this transaction involved the sale of computer programs, it qualifies. UCC 2-209 and Comment 2 permit modifications made in good faith. The oral escrow agreement was not the result of duress or extortion and therefore was made in good faith. B is incorrect because the Statute of Frauds does apply to modifications under 2-209(3). C is incorrect because a modification that does not satisfy the Statute of Frauds can operate as a waiver of the contract provision prohibiting oral modifications under 2-209(4). D is incorrect because UCC 2-209 permits modifications without consideration.
(Line_2399): 19. Answer C is correct. A party is not required to perform by the express date stated in the contract unless time is made of the essence. If time is not of the essence, a reasonable delay is not a material breach. The computer programming company completed performance within 4 days of the completion date specified in the contract, which is a reasonable delay.
(Line_2400): 20. Answer B is correct. A breaching party can recover the reasonable value of a benefit conferred onto the non-breaching party in quasi-contract as long as the breach did not involve seriously wrongful or unconscionable conduct. If the other party's contractual duties have been discharged, a party can recover for restitution if: (1) the plaintiff has conferred a benefit on the defendant, (2) the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of being paid, (3) the benefits were conferred at the request of the defendant, and (4) the defendant would be unjustly enriched if retained the benefits without compensation.
(Line_2401): 21. Answer B is correct. A breaching party can recover the reasonable value of a benefit conferred onto the non-breaching party in quasi-contract as long as the breach did not involve seriously wrongful or unconscionable conduct. If the other party's contractual duties have been discharged, a party can recover for restitution if: (1) the plaintiff has conferred a benefit on the defendant, (2) the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of being paid, (3) the benefits were conferred at the request of the defendant, and (4) the defendant would be unjustly enriched if it retained the benefits without compensation.
(Line_2402): 22. Answer B is correct. If the assistant professor leased a home in response to an oral promise of reemployment by the college president, this establishes reliance on the part of the assistant professor and knowledge of that reliance on the part of the president. Therefore, under Restatement section 90, a statement of reasons would be necessary to determine whether injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the promise.
(Line_2403): 23. Answer A is correct. Part performance standing alone does not make a contract that is within the Statute of Frauds enforceable. Those jurisdictions adopting the approach in Restatement section 129 allow specific enforcement of a promise to convey land if the party seeking enforcement "in reasonable reliance on the contract and on the continuing assent of the party against whom enforcement is sought, has so changed his position that injustice can only be avoided by specific enforcement." The nephew's reliance and hardship are demonstrated by the following facts: The nephew terminated his business and moved fifty miles to care for the widower and fully performed by continuing to care for the widower for five years, the final years of which required "intimate and arduous care."
(Line_2404): 24. Answer C is correct. The resolution is an offer of a reward made to the general public. A reasonable interpretation of its words and the circumstances surrounding its broadcast on television indicate that it is inviting anyone to provide the information necessary to arrest and convict.
(Line_2405): 25. Answer D is correct. Revocation of general offers made to the public must be given publicity equal to that given to the offer and no better means of notification should be reasonably available. If the offer is not revoked, as with ordinary offers, a general offer will lapse after a reasonable time. A is incorrect because the offer was also revocable and there are no facts to support that December 31st was a reasonable time as to lapse. B is incorrect because the rules of lapse also apply to general offers made to the public. C is incorrect because general offers may be revoked so long as the revocation is given publicity equal to that given the offer and no better means of notification of revocation is reasonably available.
(Line_2406): 26. Answer C is correct. Revocation of general offers made to the public must be given publicity equal to that given to the offer and no better means of notification should be reasonably available. A is incorrect because the offer was published on the city's sole television station once daily for one week and other means may not give as sufficient notice as a daily television broadcast. B is incorrect because the television station is no longer available and the rules of revocation allow notification by other means reasonably available. D is incorrect because revocation does not require actual notice, but that the revocation be given publicity equal to that given the offer.
(Line_2407): 27. Answer D is correct. The written memorandum called for the detective to "perform" by "investigating the fire." Thus, it was unilateral, and it specified a daily rate of pay for "each day's work."
(Line_2408): 28. Answer B is correct. If the reward were characterized as a government bounty, the detective's knowledge of the reward after obtaining the confession and the earlier attempted revocation would not be determinative.
(Line_2409): 29. Answer B is correct. The mechanic was not entitled to payment unless he satisfied his contractual duties, and every contract for work or services contains an implied duty to perform in good faith or in a workmanlike manner. A is incorrect because the mechanic was not delegating his duties to the creditor under the contract; he was assigning his right to payment. C is incorrect because contract rights are freely assignable unless assignment is specifically precluded by the agreement, and the contract is silent as to assignment. D is incorrect because when the contract was made, it was not intended to confer a benefit and enforceable rights upon a third party.
(Line_2410): 30. Answer D is correct. An express contractual condition to recovery of the commission requires that a sales person be employed by the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer. A is incorrect because although the salesperson had procured the sale, his written employment agreement required that he also be employed by the manufacturer when the bill was sent to the customer. B is incorrect because the salesperson's oral promise to a third party cannot modify an express condition in his contract with his employer. C is also incorrect because although the coworker will confer a benefit upon the corporation in servicing the account, his express written contract with the manufacturer would create his expectation of payment, not a theory based upon restitution.
(Line_2411): 31. Answer C is correct. The express terms of the contract control the salesperson's right to recovery and his reasonable expectations. A is incorrect because at the time that the salesperson conferred a benefit to the manufacturer, he had no reasonable expectation of payment unless he met the express terms of his agreement. B is incorrect because the manufacturer's express contract with the salesperson is inconsistent with an implied agreement to pay a reasonable commission, and the express language controls. D is also incorrect because the salesperson's right to the commission is not dependent upon servicing the contract; rather, it is dependent upon his employment status on the date that the customer is billed.
(Line_2412): 32. Answer C is correct. III is not relevant and could not be the basis of a claim against the manufacturer because either party can terminate the employment relationship at any time in an "at-will" employment contract. Furthermore, although it may be a persuasive fact as to the salesperson's character as a good employee, it would not significantly strengthen any claim against the manufacturer because under an "at will" contract, even good employees can be fired at anytime, for any reason, as long as it is not against public policy.
(Line_2413): 33. Answer C is correct. The fabric company breached the contract because it contained an express prohibition of assignment of rights. A prohibition against the assignment of a contract takes away the assignor's right to assign, not the assignor's power to assign. If an assignment is made in breach of an express contractual provision, the obligor (the business enterprise) has a right to damages for the breach, but this right does not render the assignment ineffective unless the assignee (the finance company) knew of the prohibition. For this reason, A is incorrect. Note: a prohibition against assignment is not the same as an invalidation of an assignment. In the latter situation, if a contractual provision renders an assignment void, the assignor has neither the right nor the power to assign the contract. B is incorrect because the covenant does allow the business enterprise to sue for damages for breach of the covenant. D is incorrect because covenants against assignment can apply to either the buyer or seller, and the express terms of the agreement preclude both parties from assigning the contract.
(Line_2414): 34. Answer B is correct. The fabric company was required to provide clear and adequate notice to the business enterprise of the assignment to the finance company before the business enterprise made payment. A and C are incorrect because when the business enterprise paid the fabric company before receiving notice of the assignment, the business enterprise's obligation was discharged. D is incorrect because an effective assignment by the fabric company to the finance company resulted in the finance company's standing in the place of the fabric company for receipt of payment. The anti-assignability clause in the contract between the business enterprise and the fabric company took away the fabric company's right to assign, but not its ability to assign.
(Line_2415): 35. Answer D is correct. Number I is incorrect because an incidental beneficiary is one who fortuitously and incidentally anticipates a benefit resulting from a transaction between others. Pursuant to the express language of the agreement, payments were to be made directly to the creditor for two months, rendering payment not fortuitous, but deliberately contemplated by the agreement. Number II is incorrect because although the creditor is an intended creditor beneficiary of the fabric company, it had no knowledge of its rights under the contract. Without knowledge, there could be no justifiable reliance or assent, without which its rights to payment under the contract had not vested.
(Line_2416): 36. Answer D is correct. A party's obligations under a requirements contract subject to the UCC 2-306 are measured by good faith. A shut-down by a requirements buyer for lack of orders or market conditions meets the good faith standard.
(Line_2417): 37. Answer C is correct. If this language is construed as making time of the essence, it becomes an express condition to the builder's obligation to pay. The landowner's failure to meet this condition would discharge the builder's duty to perform.
(Line_2418): 38. Answer C is correct. Unless the contract provides otherwise, a contractual duty may be delegated to another unless the other party to the contract has a substantial interest in having the original obligor perform. Typically the other party will have such an interest where the contract is a personal services contract involving aesthetic taste and judgment. Although the painter-farmer contract is one for personal services (painting), the item to be painted is a standard barn and therefore the contract is not one involving aesthetic taste or judgment, and the farmer should be indifferent about whether the work is done by the the painter or by the contractor. Therefore, the painter's delegation of the duty was not a breach, even if it was done without the consent of the farmer, and if the farmer refuses performance by the contractor, he will be in breach of contract. A and B are thus incorrect. D is incorrect because the mere delegation of a duty, even if assented to by the obligee (the farmer), does not effect a novation; a novation would require an express agreement by the farmer to substitute the contractor for the painter.
(Line_2419): 39. Answer A is correct. Unless the other party to the contract (the farmer) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor (the painter). Therefore, where the duty to paint the farmer's barn has been delegated and the delegatee (the contractor) breaches the duty by failing to meet contract specifications, the farmer may enforce the contract against the original obligor (the painter). B and D are incorrect because, although the farmer may also enforce the obligation against the contractor (since the farmer is the intended beneficiary of the agreement that delegated the duty), delegation does not discharge the painter of his obligation to the farmer. C is incorrect because the farmer has a right to enforce the obligation against either party.
(Line_2420): 40. Answer C is correct. Pursuant to UCC 2-512(2), if the contract requires payment before inspection, payment does not constitute acceptance or impair a buyer's right to inspect or any of the buyer's remedies. For this reason both A and B are incorrect. D is incorrect because such payment provisions are valid pursuant to UCC 2-512(1).
(Line_2421): 41. Answer C is correct because a buyer is entitled to reject nonconforming goods and to obtain damages pursuant to UCC 2-712(2), which is calculated as the difference between the cost of cover for substitute goods and the contract price. A is incorrect because there are no facts to support a conclusion that blue wool No. 1 quality is unique or that there are other proper circumstances pursuant to UCC 2-716(1), such as an inability to cover. B is incorrect. The difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of conforming goods is the appropriate remedy under UCC 2-714 for accepted goods and the buyer tendered back the goods. D is also incorrect because payment prior to inspection does not constitute an acceptance or a waiver of any contract remedies under UCC 2-512(2).
(Line_2422): 42. Answer B is correct. Pursuant to UCC 2-711(3) and 2-706(3), the buyer had a security interest in the goods and had a right to resell. Thus, D is incorrect. A is incorrect because the buyer's right to resell at a private sale exists only if the seller is given reasonable notice. C is incorrect because the sale may be either public or private - UCC 2-706(2).
(Line_2423): 43. Answer D is correct because the pharmaceutical salesman was not a merchant (UCC), and no consideration was paid for the option (common law), thus the offer was freely revocable. A is incorrect because UCC 2-205 limits firm offers to merchants; the pharmaceutical salesman is a sales person who does not deal in motorcycles or otherwise hold himself out by occupation as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the goods involved in the transaction (UCC 2-104).
(Line_2424): 44. Answer B is correct. The widget salesman's letter was not an appropriate method of acceptance because the pharmaceutical salesman's letter offer requested performance; thus, the mail box rule would not apply to make the acceptance effective upon dispatch, and the pharmaceutical salesman's offer remained freely revocable. A is incorrect because the letter could not be reasonably construed as the beginning of performance. C is incorrect because the offer called for a unilateral acceptance. D is also incorrect because the offer did not invite the widget salesman to choose between acceptance by promise and acceptance by performance.
(Line_2425): 45. B is the correct answer. The call of the question asks for the probable legal effect of the friend's conversation with the widget salesman regarding the purchase of the friend's motorcycle, which indicates that the issue is revocation of an offer. The question to be answered, therefore, is whether a contract had been formed between the pharmaceutical salesman and the widget salesman, and if the conversation with the friend impacted that contract. The pharmaceutical salesman offered the widget salesman a unilateral contract. The method of acceptance was the presentation of the motorcycle on or before November 12. B is the best answer because it thoroughly addresses the issues of revocation between the widget salesman and the pharmaceutical salesman, both of which are probable legal effects of the conversation between the widget salesman and the friend.
(Line_2426): 46. Answer B is correct. A valid contract existed for the sale of lot 101 for $5,000; the owner did not supply consideration for the modification, the modification was coercive to the buyer and not fair and equitable, and the owner could have anticipated that a shopping center was going to be built on adjacent property. The $6,000 price for the remaining forty-nine lots will be enforced because there was no agreement as to these lots, and the owner's statement on May 3 amounted to a revocation of his original offer as to the remaining lots and a new offer.
(Line_2427): 47. Answer D is correct. The owner's telephone call on May 5 informing the buyer that the remaining lots had been sold was a manifestation of the owner's intention not to enter into a contract with the buyer for the remaining lots and thus a revocation of his May 1 offer.
(Line_2428): 48. Answer C is correct. When the buyer accepted the owner's offer to buy lot 101 on May 2, he implicitly rejected the offer to purchase the remaining lots, and his rejection terminated his power of acceptance as to the remaining lots. A is incorrect because at the time the contract was made on May 2, the owner either had reason to know that he did not have good title to the remaining lots or he was at fault in not knowing, and thus his performance would not be excused as impossible or impracticable. B is incorrect because both parties were mistaken as to the owner's interest in the property. D is incorrect because, although the law does imply a condition into the agreement that the owner convey marketable title, the owner's failure to do so allows the buyer to elect to either rescind or to take title with the defect and to pay the full purchase price.
(Line_2429): 49. Answer D is correct. An implied-in-fact contract is a type of enforceable contract, but one that is based on a tacit rather than an express promise. An implied-in-fact promise may be inferred from parties' conduct, such as where services are rendered by one person to another under circumstances where it may fairly be presumed that the parties understood that compensation would be paid. The doctor is entitled to recover payment from the victim on an implied-in-fact contract theory, since the victim implicitly agreed to pay for services rendered when the victim sought and received medical treatment from the doctor.
(Line_2430): 50. Answer D is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise, such as where the promisor must know that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary unless and until the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if he materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise or manifests assent to the promise at the request of the promisor or promisee. The doctor appears to be an intended beneficiary of the agreement between the victim and the attorney, since the promise to pay "any physician" who treats the victim's injuries manifests an intent by the parties to confer standing on the doctor to enforce the promise. The doctor's rights as beneficiary did not vest, however, before the victim and the attorney discharged the duty when they executed the release. Although the doctor received notice of the promise, he did not rely on it, since the services were rendered before he received notice of the promise.
(Line_2431): 51. Answer A is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise, such as where the promisor must know that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary unless and until the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if he materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise or manifests assent to the promise at the request of the promisor or promisee. The doctor appears to be an intended beneficiary of the agreement between the victim and the attorney, since the promise to pay "any physician" who treats the victim's injuries manifests an intent by the parties to confer standing on the doctor to enforce the promise. Although the doctor received notice of the promise before the victim and the attorney executed the release, he never gave express notice of his assent to the promise to the victim or to the attorney. The doctor may try to argue, however, that his assent to the promise was implied and therefore his rights as beneficiary had vested, thereby cutting off the right to effect a discharge of the promise to pay.
(Line_2432): 52. Answer C is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise. A party will be found to be an intended beneficiary where recognition of standing to enforce the promise is appropriate to effectuate the intent of the parties and where the beneficiary is either a creditor beneficiary (where performance of the promise will satisfy a debt of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary) or a donee beneficiary (where the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the performance). If anything, the doctor is merely an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the colleague and the victim, since the colleague's promise to represent the victim in his action against the driver neither satisfies the victim's debt to the doctor nor does it relate to any intent on the victim's part to confer a benefit on the doctor. D is incorrect because any reliance by the doctor on the colleague's promise would not be reasonable, as he cannot show that he is an intended beneficiary of that promise.
(Line_2433): 53. Answer D is correct. Under the Statute of Frauds, a promise to sell an interest in land must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute to be enforceable. Although the land contract provision of the statute has been broadly construed to include rights of way, the neighbor-landowner agreement does not fall within the land contract provision because the neighbor's promise ("permitting the digging") was a gratuitous conveyance and not a contract for sale. Similarly, a promise that cannot be performed within a year of its making falls within the one-year provision of the statute. Because the landowner-builder agreement was made on March 1 and the performance is to be completed by June 1, this agreement falls outside the one-year provision since it can be performed within a year of its making. Because neither agreement falls within the statute of frauds, the fact that the agreements were not in writing is not a valid defense. Therefore, A, B and C are incorrect.
(Line_2434): 54. Answer A is correct. Number I is correct because the builder has partially breached his contract with the landowner by performing late. The landowner is thus entitled to damages caused by the delay. Number II is not correct because the builder has substantially performed, and the landowner therefore cannot withhold his entire payment. Instead the landowner must pay the $5,000 minus any offset for damages caused by the one-month delay.
(Line_2435): 55. Answer B is correct. The father is entitled to damages representing the reasonable cost of completion, which is an amount equal to what another contractor would require to complete performance minus what the father would have paid to the contractor to complete performance.
(Line_2436): 56. Answer C is correct. In addition to direct expectation recovery, the father would be entitled to damages for consequential loss because the contractor knew of the special circumstances for which the house was being built and the deadline giving rise to these damages for delay.
(Line_2437): 57. Answer B is correct. The condition in the contract fixing the time for payment was not a material part of the agreed exchange and therefore was subject to repeated waiver when the contractor failed to object as each of the four months passed without payment. By doing so, he voluntarily abandoned this contractual condition for these months. The condition requiring a monthly certification prior to payment was waived by the father each time he made monthly payments without requiring certification. He was, however, permitted to revoke the waiver and reinstate the certification condition as to future payments if he allowed the contractor reasonable time to obtain the certificates and if the contractor had not detrimentally relied upon the waiver.
(Line_2438): 58. C is correct. To answer this question, you must first map out the required order of performances. The building owner must convey the apartment to the purchaser, and at the same time the purchaser must convey the farm to the building owner, or no further duty arises on anyone's part. After the purchaser conveys the farm (but no more than three months after), the building owner has a duty to remove the shed behind the apartment. So, the building owner's conveyance of the apartment and the purchaser's tender of the farm are concurrent conditions, and the building owner's removal of the shed is a condition precedent to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000. Based on the contract language and order of performances cited in the question, answer C is the least accurate statement concerning that order.
(Line_2439): 59. A is the correct answer. While the responses seem confusingly similar, this answer can be reached through the process of elimination. D can be eliminated immediately. Clearly, the issue here is the determination of whether the obligation to remove the shed is a condition subsequent or condition precedent, not whether it is a condition at all. Black's Law dictionary defines a condition precedent as "an act or event, other than the lapse of time, that must exist or occur before a duty to perform something promised arises." The building owner's obligation to remove the shed within three months cannot be a condition precedent because it turns on the lapse of time. Therefore, B can be eliminated. Black's Law defines a condition subsequent as "a condition that, if it occurs, will bring something else to an end." In form, the building owner's obligation to remove the shed within three months of the transfer of property was a condition subsequent to the exchange of the purchaser's farm for the building owner's apartment house. In substance, however, it was a condition precedent to the purchaser's obligation to pay the additional $1,000 six months after the exchange. As a result, C is clearly an incomplete response and can be eliminated. Thus, A is the appropriate response and B, C and D are incorrect.
(Line_2440): 60. Answer B is correct. Unilateral modifications of contractual obligations lack consideration under the preexisting duty rule and therefore may be unenforceable. However, a promise to surrender a legal claim is sufficient consideration to support a return promise even if the claim turns out to be invalid, so long as the person surrendering the claim has a good faith belief in its validity. Because the borrower may argue that the unilateral modification of the debt is unenforceable due to the preexisting duty rule, the lender may argue that his promise to settle the claim provided sufficient consideration. The lender's argument will not succeed, however, if the lender knew that the claim was not valid.
(Line_2441): 61. Answer A is correct. An implied-in-fact contract is an enforceable contract based on a tacit, rather than an express, promise. An implied-in-fact promise may be inferred from parties' conduct or from their statements when interpreted in the context of broader circumstances. Although the president did not expressly promise that she would type the professor's manuscript on the following Monday in exchange for payment, such an exchange may fairly be implied from the broader context of her responses to the professor's statements.B and D are incorrect because in order for the professor to enforce the president's promise on a detrimental reliance theory, he would need to show that his change in position in reliance on the president's promise was such a detriment that enforcement of the promise would be necessary to avoid injustice.
(Line_2442): 62. Answer B is correct. An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter a bargain, which is made in such a way that the offeree is justified in thinking that her assent will conclude a bargain. Advertisements or announcements directed to the public at large typically are construed as invitations to deal and not as offers, in part out of concern that an open-ended offer to the public would expose the offeror to excessive liability. This rationale will not apply, however, if the language in the announcement is qualified with limiting language such as "first come first served." Because the faculty's $500 offer was limited to the winner of the competition, the public posting of the faculty's notice may reasonably be construed to be an offer.
(Line_2443): 63. Answer C is correct. Where an offer is for a unilateral contract (an offer that seeks only performance and does not seek a return promise) and the offeree begins the invited performance, the offeror may not revoke the promise. This rule is intended to protect the substantial reliance of the offeree that results when accepting an offer for a unilateral contract by performance over a period of time. Because the faculty's offer of $500 sought only performance (winning the competition) and did not seek a commitment to perform, it was an offer for a unilateral contract. Once the student commenced performance, the faculty was not free to revoke the offer, so its attempted revocation on April 1 was ineffective.
(Line_2444): 64. Answer A is correct. An offer for a unilateral contract is one that seeks only performance and does not seek a return promise. Offers for both unilateral and bilateral contracts may be accepted by commencing performance; what distinguishes unilateral contracts from bilateral contracts is that with the former, the offeree is not bound to complete the requested performance. The faculty's offer seeks a unilateral contract only, because it would be unreasonable to construe the offer as seeking a return commitment by the offeree to complete the requested performance, since no student can guarantee that she will be the winner of the competition. B, C and D are incorrect because each suggests that the offer reasonably could be construed as an offer for a bilateral contract.
(Line_2445): 65. Answer B is correct. An offer seeking only a performance and not a return promise is an offer for a unilateral contract. Such an offer is accepted once the requested performance has been completed and notice of acceptance has been given to the offeror. Once the offeree under a unilateral contract begins the invited performance, the offeror may not revoke the promise; however, the offeror's obligation is conditioned upon the offeree completing performance in accordance with the offer's terms. Even if the student were killed on April 16, the student's representative would still be entitled to enforce the faculty's promise because the requested performance (completion of the winning research paper) was completed and because the faculty's attempt to revoke the offer on April 1 was ineffective.
(Line_2446): 66. Answer B is correct. When a party's obligation under a contract is subject to a satisfaction condition, generally the party may not avoid liability simply by expressing dissatisfaction with the performance - the dissatisfaction must be expressed either reasonably or in good faith, depending on the nature of the obligation. Where the performance at issue involves aesthetic taste and judgment (such as an obligation to take a family portrait or holiday photo), the party whose obligation to pay is subject to the condition may only express dissatisfaction honestly, or in good faith. Therefore, so long as the customer subjectively thought that the photograph was unsatisfactory, he is discharged of his obligation to pay, even if a reasonable person would have been satisfied with the work.
(Line_2447): 67. Answer D is correct. The agreement expressly stated that the customer would have thirty days after the photographer completed performance to make payment. Additionally, the contract contained a conditional satisfaction clause rendering payment due only if the customer was satisfied with the photographer's performance.
(Line_2448): 68. Answer C is correct. Where the existence of a particular person is necessary for the performance of a duty, his incapacity, if sufficient to make performance impracticable, may operate to excuse performance of the contract. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the contract between the customer and the photographer required the photographer to take a photograph of "[the customer] and his family," the customer's availability was necessary for the performance of the photographer's duty and therefore his illness excused the photographer's delay in completing the cards by the December 15 due date. Since the photographer had no way of knowing of the customer's recovery, his obligation to resume performance was conditioned upon receiving notice of it. Although the customer might have taken the position that the delay beyond December was material, thereby justifying the discharge of any further obligation, his conduct (informing the photographer to "take the photograph anyway") amounted to a waiver of the December 15 deadline. Answer C is the least accurate statement since, as explained above, the customer's illness provided a basis for excuse of the delay.
(Line_2449): 69. Answer C is correct. In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by bargained-for consideration. Consideration is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. Although the husband's promise states that it is given "in consideration of the man's saving" the wife's life, in fact it is not sufficient consideration to support the husband's promise. The husband did not make the promise to pay $1,000 in exchange for the man's act, nor did the man save the wife's life in exchange for the husband's promise.
(Line_2450): 70. Answer B is correct. A promise to surrender a legal claim is sufficient consideration to support a return promise even if the claim turns out to be invalid, so long as the person surrendering the claim has a good faith belief in its validity. As long as the man genuinely believed that he had a valid claim against the husband, his promise to relinquish such claim provides sufficient consideration to support the husband's promise to pay the man $1,000.
(Line_2451): 71. Answer A is correct. The man supplied consideration for the husband's promise to pay the man $1,000 because his forbearance to assert a claim against the husband's qualifies as consideration so long as the man had a good faith belief in his right to make such a claim.
(Line_2452): 72. Answer A is correct. A party's performance under a contract may be excused on grounds of supervening impracticability where the performance is made impracticable without his fault due to the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the flood was an act of God that related to a basic assumption of the agreement to repair the homeowner's house, it operated to excuse any resulting delay in completing the requested work. Whether or not the delay was sufficiently severe to discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract depends on whether circumstances have so changed that performance will become materially more burdensome than the agreed-upon performance. The carpenter's busy schedule after March suggests that continued performance after the delay would be materially burdensome and thus his obligation should be completely discharged.
(Line_2453): 73. Answer C is correct. The engineer made no representations or partial disclosures to the stockholder regarding the facts. A is incorrect because the engineer did not misrepresent this knowledge to the stockholder. B is incorrect because the engineer had no confidential or other relationship with the stockholder requiring disclosure. D is incorrect because the stockholder could have obtained this publicly available statement, but absent some relationship requiring disclosure, the engineer would not be required to disclose her superior knowledge regarding the facts of the transaction.
(Line_2454): 74. Answer A is correct. Although the contract required consent for assignment and the buyer has the right to damages for breach of this prohibition, the assignment of payment rights to the friend is effective. Assignment of contractual rights, such as the right to be paid, are effective even if the contract prohibits it, unless the clause makes assignments "void" or the assignee had notice, neither of which is present here. Thus, D is incorrect. B is incorrect because the chairs were destroyed and their market value would be zero; thus, the expectation interest is the contract price. C is incorrect because, under the UCC, the risk of loss passed to the buyer when the goods were delivered by the seller to the carrier.
(Line_2455): 75. Answer D is correct. Under the UCC, the risk of loss passed to the buyer when the seller delivered the goods to the carrier for shipment. For this reason, A and B are incorrect. C is also incorrect because even if the risk of loss had not shifted to the buyer, the subject matter of the contract remains available in the form of replacement chairs, and performance is thus not impossible or impracticable.
(Line_2456): 76. Answer D is correct. The plumber's rejection of the owner's offer on the 15th ended that negotiation, and the letter sent on the 20th was a new, separate, and distinct offer. There was no contract because silence could only operate as an acceptance in this case if the owner wished or intended to be bound by his silence. The plumber bears the risk of uncertainty in phrasing his offer in this manner; the purpose underlying this rule of law is to protect the offeree from imposition. Thus, the owner's silence will operate as acceptance only if he intends for his silence to manifest acceptance. Because he is unaware of the plumber's performance, there are no facts to support his intent to accept the offer made by the plumber on March 20.
(Line_2457): 77. A is the correct answer.
(Line_2458): 78. Answer D is correct. Prior to the modification, the niece had no knowledge and thus no reliance on her status as a third-party beneficiary under the contract. As such, her rights had not vested. For these reasons A is incorrect. B is incorrect because payment to the niece was set forth in the original agreement as a gift. An assignment, on the other hand, involves the transfer of rights under an existing contract. C is also incorrect because an intended beneficiary, even if gratuitous, need not supply consideration in order to enforce a right to recovery. All that is necessary is that the right vest.
(Line_2459): 79. Answer C is correct. Under the statute of Frauds, promises made to answer for the debt of another generally fall within the suretyship clause of the statute and therefore must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute. The uncle's promise to the daughter falls within the suretyship provision of the statute, since it is a promise by the uncle to the daughter to answer for the debt of the woman. Because the promise was oral, it did not meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute and therefore is not enforceable.
(Line_2460): 80. Answer B is correct because the parties had entered into a valid unilateral contract supported by consideration when the woman promised to pay the daughter if she got A's. Although the woman had died, the contract was not impaired and, in fact, became enforceable upon the daughter's performance. Answer A is incorrect because promissory estoppel applies only in the absence of consideration.
(Line_2461): 81. Answer C is correct. Under the UCC's perfect tender rule, when a delivery under a contract for the sale of goods fails to conform in any respect to the contract, the buyer has the right to reject the delivery and, if the defective delivery is not timely cured, pursue remedies for breach of contract. Since the seller promised to deliver 100 bushels of wheat on August 1 and delivered only 95 bushels on that date, the buyer is entitled to reject the delivery and claim damages for breach.
(Line_2462): 82. Answer C is correct. Under the UCC, repudiation of a contractual obligation may be treated as a total breach of that obligation. In order to amount to repudiation, however, the statement must be unequivocal; a statement that merely expresses doubt over a party's ability or willingness to perform is not sufficient. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the other party's performance, the other may make a written demand for adequate assurances of performance and suspend return performance if commercially reasonable. Failure to respond to a justified demand for assurances is a repudiation of the contract. At the time of the buyer's receipt of the seller's notice on May 10, the seller had not repudiated the contract, as the notice only expressed doubt over whether performance was possible. The notice did, however, provide reasonable grounds for the buyer to demand adequate assurances of performance and to suspend its return performance.
(Line_2463): 83. Answer D is correct. Under the UCC, when either party repudiates a contract for the sale of goods with respect to a performance whose loss will substantially affect the value of the contract, the non-repudiating party may await performance for a commercially reasonable time or immediately resort to remedies for breach of contract. The non-repudiating party, however, may not recover damages that he might have mitigated with reasonable effort. The repudiating party is still free to retract its repudiation unless the non-repudiating party has relied on it or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final. The seller's June 10 statement that it would not perform the contract, when read in light of its earlier communications and failure to make a delivery when due, amounts to a repudiation that gives the buyer the right to bring immediate action for breach. Therefore, each of A, B and C are incorrect, since each of the statements is accurate. D is the least accurate because as of June 10, in light of the seller's repudiation, the buyer can immediately bring an action for breach and is not obligated to give the seller a commercially reasonable time for performance.
(Line_2464): 84. Answer D is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). The oral commitment that the financing company seeks to introduce (that the loan would be repaid "on or before July 1") contradicts the final writing executed between the parties (stating that the corporation promises to repay the loan "on September 1"). Therefore, it is barred by the parol evidence rule.
(Line_2465): 85. Answer D is correct. The Statute of Frauds requires that agreements to act as a surety or to guarantee the debt of another, when there has not been a novation, are within the statute and require a writing.
(Line_2466): 86. Answer B is correct. An option promise is a promise not to revoke an offer to enter into a contract, and it requires separate consideration to be enforceable. When a party exercises an option, that party in effect accepts the offer and binds himself to the contract. The friend paid the neighbor $10,000 in exchange for the neighbor's promise not to revoke his offer to sell. When the friend exercised the option, he became obligated to purchase Broadacres for $325,000, and his failure to consummate his purchase entitled the neighbor to pursue remedies for breach of contract. Specific performance generally will be awarded for breach of contract where an award of monetary damages would be inadequate or impracticable. Contracts involving the sale of land historically have been regarded as unique, and therefore equitable relief traditionally has been allowed, even where the breaching party is the buyer. Because the obligation that the neighbor seeks to enforce is the friend's obligation to purchase Broadacres (a contract to purchase land), specific performance will be awarded.
(Line_2467): 87. Answer C is correct. The language of the financier-investor's promise may not be sufficient to assign its rights of payment from its contract with the winery. The language simply says the bank can collect to satisfy the financier-investor's debt to the bank "from my share of the profits." A is incorrect because contract rights are freely assignable. B is incorrect because if the agreement between the financier-investor and the winery were found to be a partnership agreement, partnership interests are assignable. D is incorrect because the bank need not qualify as a beneficiary under the first contract to acquire the financier-investor's right to profits under that agreement.
(Line_2468): 88. Answer A is correct. The financier-investor relied upon the fact that the winery was famous for its vineyards when the financier-investor entered into the five-year agreement with the winery. The winery was thus not free to delegate its duty of grape production to an inexperienced buyer, because this act of delegation would impair the financier-investor's reasonable expectations under the agreement.
(Line_2469): 89. Answer A is correct. The retailer satisfied its duty to promptly notify the manufacturer that the goods were rejected as nonconforming.
(Line_2470): 90. Answer C is correct. When the retailer rejected the ties, the agreed time for performance (July 1) had not expired; thus, the manufacturer, who had performed in good faith and who notified the retailer of an intent to cure by shipping conforming ties, could do so as long as the conforming delivery was made within the agreed time. UCC 2-508(1). For these reasons, A is incorrect. B is incorrect because anticipatory repudiation consists of an indication by the seller through words or conduct that breach would occur when performance was due. The nonconforming shipment without notice was an attempted acceptance and simultaneous breach. D is incorrect because even if the manufacturer's telegram "Will deliver proper ties before July 1" could be construed as an offer and not a notice of intent to cure, the retailer's silence in response could not constitute acceptance of an offer to modify.
(Line_2471): 91. Answer D is correct. To the extent that the stepson was a third-party beneficiary of the deposit agreement, his rights were abrogated before they vested because he neither knew about nor relied upon the existence of the deposit account prior to abrogation. For this reason A is incorrect. B is incorrect because the widow did not assign her rights under another agreement to her stepson when she established the first deposit agreement. C is incorrect because the stepson's possession of the passbook was not necessary for the right to vest. His possession would constitute performance of the duty to him under the contract after the right had vested.
(Line_2472): 92. Answer C is correct. The widow orally manifested her intent to gratuitously assign her rights in the passbook savings account directly to her stepson. A and B are incorrect because only promises to make future gifts are revocable. Completed gifts are not revocable, and when she gave her stepson the passbook, she lost her right to revoke. D is incorrect because an assignment takes effect immediately and is not revocable.
(Line_2473): 93. Answer C is correct. Statements 1 and 2 involve false representations of fact about the car, which the dealer knows to be false, which were made with intent to induce the buyer to enter into the contract, which would induce the buyer to enter into the agreement, and which would cause injury to the buyer because the false statements were made by someone with superior knowledge about the car and they related to its value and ascertainable facts about the car. For these reasons, A and B are incorrect. D is incorrect because Statement 3 represents either an opinion that is open to question or, more likely, a statement of "puffery" upon which the buyer should not have relied.
(Line_2474): 94. Answer D is correct. Because the contract specified that the goods were to be delivered "not later than November 15, for the Yule shopping season," time was of the essence and was an express condition requiring strict compliance by the factory. The factory's failure to meet this condition gave the store the right to terminate their contract and to claim damages for the factory's breach.
(Line_2475): 95. Answer A is correct. The factory's assignment to the finance company was made to secure a loan and, as such, was an assignment of payment rights, not a delegation of duties. The assignment was also made conditional upon the factory not paying its $15,000 loan with the finance company within 50 days. The 50-day time for repayment had not passed on November 16 when the lawsuit was filed, the factory was not in default, and the finance company had not yet assumed any rights under this agreement.B is incorrect because a public filing is not required for a valid assignment. Notice to the obligor (the store) is required.
(Line_2476): 96. Answer C is correct. Because the promises were exchanged when the teenager was a minor, he had voidable rights under the contract. His July 1 letter was written upon his eighteenth birthday, and because agreements cannot be partially disaffirmed, this letter amounted to a disaffirmance of the prior agreement. Thus, the only amount the dealer can receive is the amount now offered by the teenager.
(Line_2477): 97. Answer D is correct. The inventor's letter to the owner of the retail specialty shop, when taken in conjunction with the surrounding circumstances - the television advertisement - constituted an offer to the owner, which the owner could accept by complying with the television advertisement's method of acceptance. Since no duration was stated in either the advertisement or the letter to the owner, the offer would lapse after a reasonable time under the circumstances.
(Line_2478): 98. Answer C is correct. If the inventor's written reply were construed as an offer, the owner of the retail specialty shop accepted that offer when it tendered the requested payment and did not attempt to state additional or different terms in its acceptance. The inventor's letter with shipment, which contained an additional provision, would have no legal effect, and the inventor would not have a cause of action against the owner of the retail specialty shop. However, answer C assumes that the inventor's written reply that quoted $39.99 was not an offer. Based on that assumption, the inventor's shipment of the LBVCs with the attached invoice stating "these items shall not be offered for resale at retail" would be considered an offer and the owner of the retail specialty shop's acceptance and display of the products after reading the invoice would be considered an acceptance of the offer. Because the owner of the retail specialty shop accepted the offer, which included the provision restricting resale of the products, the inventor would have a cause of action against the owner.
(Line_2479): 99. Answer C is correct. Specific performance is not an available remedy in a dispute involving a contract for personal services because such an order might violate the involuntary servitude clause of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and such an order would be difficult to supervise and enforce. Contract remedies also reflect a reluctance to restrict individual autonomy and instead permit breach followed by payment of damages.
(Line_2480): 100. Answer A is correct. Number I is correct because when a party delegates duties under a contract with the consent of the obligee (the sculptor), it does not result in a complete substitution of the delegatee (the newly-licensed architect) for the delegator (the renowned architect). The architect cannot unilaterally release himself from his obligation to the sculptor, and remains liable for the newly-licensed architect's failure to perform or defective performance.
(Line_2481): 101. Answer A is correct. The dealer's expectation recovery under the contract is the purchase price paid by the purchaser minus the cost the dealer incurred in obtaining the car.
(Line_2482): 102. Answer A is correct. When the builder contacted the landowner on February 1 stating that he would not perform unless the landowner paid the builder more money for the same work, the builder was in total breach of the contract because his statement to the builder made clear that he was going to breach when performance became due. This statement was an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement.
(Line_2483): 103. Answer D is correct. The landowner is entitled to damages representing the difference between the original contract price with the builder ($60,000) and his contract price with the third-party ($75,000). He is not entitled to an additional amount representing the $10,000 extra that he paid the third-party because he was not contractually obligated to pay that amount to the third-party. It would, therefore, not be a part of the actual loss he avoided by the substitute transaction. For this reason C is incorrect.
(Line_2484): 104. Answer B is correct. The subject matter of the option, five acres of a 100-acre farm, was not identified with reasonable specificity and as such was vague and unenforceable. A is incorrect because separate consideration is not necessary to support an option that is a term under an existing contract, such as the five-year lease agreement between the landowner and the farmer. The option is simply considered one of the rights purchased by the lessee under the lease and is also supported by the $2,000 yearly consideration paid by the farmer. C is incorrect. The landowner's oral promise to survey the land was a promise to perform an act, and this promise was not
(Line_2485): 105. Answer A is correct. The benefits (planting trees and building grain silo) were not done officiously or gratuitously because at the time the farmer did these things, he reasonably believed that he could exercise his option to purchase a five-acre portion of the farm, which he could only exercise at the end of the lease.
(Line_2486): 106. Answer B is correct. Both parties knew that the landowner would not be available to take possession on October 1. The liquidated damages provision thus operates as a penalty and will not be enforced because it does not fix damages in light of anticipated or actual harm. Damages will thus be limited to any harm the landowner suffered in taking possession two weeks after the stated completion date. For this reason, A is incorrect. C is incorrect because occupation and payment without knowledge of the delay cannot constitute a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a right. D is incorrect because this statement, standing alone, is insufficient to indicate the landowner's intent to modify the completion date.
(Line_2487): 107. Answer C is correct. By repudiating his obligation to pay the remainder of the contract price, the boater breached and the retailer is entitled to recover its lost profit on the sale to the boater. The advance payment must be restored to the boater to the extent it exceeds the lost profit under the agreement and it does ($4,000.00 minus $2,500.00, the latter of which is the selling price of $12,000.00 minus the manufacturer's price of $9,500.00).
(Line_2488): 108. Answer C is correct. The nephew did not provide consideration when he agreed to settle his claim against the testator's estate because he knew that he was surrendering an invalid claim. Answer A is incorrect because although the nephew bargained for the settlement, he knew he was not agreeing to surrender any right at the time he entered into the agreement. Answer B is incorrect because although the law encourages settlement, it does so when the settlement is undertaken based upon the good faith belief that the party is relinquishing a valid claim. Answer D is incorrect because parties can modify legal rights and settle disputes so long as they do so in good faith.
(Line_2489): 109. Answer C is correct. Restitution generally is not available to recover a benefit conferred pursuant to a valid and binding contract. When determining whether a contract may be unenforceable on grounds of unconscionability, the fairness of the exchange is determined as of the time that the contract was entered into. Although the price of $20,000 may seem unfair as of October 2, the risk that the 84-year-old man would die within a short period was one that he assumed when he entered into the contract on September 25.
(Line_2490): 110. Answer D is correct. Damages for breach of contract may be recovered for loss that the breaching party had reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach at the time the contract was made. In addition, damages may not be recoverable to the extent that they cannot be determined with reasonable certainty. Although new businesses may have trouble making this determination with respect to lost profits caused by a breach of contract (such as the baseball star's lost opportunities to obtain other contracts or endorsements), such damages may be awarded if they are not based on mere conjecture and speculation.
(Line_2491): 111. Answer C is correct. Under the UCC, a contract for exclusive dealing in a good imposes on the part of the seller an obligation to use best efforts to supply the good and an obligation on the part of the buyer to use its best efforts to promote the good's sale. Therefore the baked goods retailer was under an implied obligation to use its best efforts to promote the sale of the pastry company's buns for the duration of the contract.
(Line_2492): 112. Answer C is correct. Under the UCC, a quantity term in a contract that is measured by the output of the seller means such actual output as may occur in good faith. The pastry company is permitted under the contract to reduce its output of buns, even to discontinue bun-making entirely, but only if the reason for doing so was made in good faith rather than to avoid its obligation under the contract. Therefore there is a question of fact as to whether the pastry company's decision to discontinue bun-making was made in good faith. A, B and D are incorrect because the question of whether the pastry company has breached the output contract involves an issue of material fact.
(Line_2493): 113. Answer A is correct. A promise is not consideration to support a return promise if by its terms the promisor unconditionally reserves the right of alternative performances, such as reserving the right to cancel an order. Such a promise is an illusory promise. When the wholesaler reserved the right to cancel the order at any time before September 1, this meant that as of July 22, the wholesaler gave only an illusory promise to purchase the shovels. Therefore, as of that time the contract was not enforceable against either party.
(Line_2494): 114. Answer A is correct. An illusory promise may become consideration if the time during which the promisor could choose alternative performances has passed. Although reserving the right to terminate a contract for a specified period makes a promise illusory, the promise becomes consideration once the period for exercising the right to terminate has passed. Therefore, because the wholesaler did not exercise its right to cancel the order, the manufacturer became bound to the contract as of September 1.
(Line_2495): 115. Answer C is correct. The UCC allows a breaching buyer a limited right to restitution of a downpayment, minus either the liquidated damages amount (whether agreed-upon or the statutory minimum) or the actual damages that can be proven by the seller. Where an injured seller can demonstrate that breach by a buyer has caused it to lose profits due to a lower volume of sales, the seller may recover the profit that the seller would have made from full performance. Because the retailer is a high-volume retailer, the boater's breach likely caused it to lose profits due to lost volume. Therefore the boater may recover restitution of the $4000 downpayment, less the profit that the retailer would have made on the sale.
(Line_2496): 116. Answer B is correct. An offer is a manifestation of a willingness to bargain that creates a capacity in the offeree to form a contract by consent. Since the form that the well driller sent to the developer stated that the proposal would not be a contract until signed by both parties, it is not an offer because it does not manifest an intent to conclude a contract upon mere signing by the developer. However, after the developer signed the form, the form became an offer that the well driller could accept either by signing the form or by manifesting assent in some other way (such as by commencing performance).
(Line_2497): 117. Answer B is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to prove the existence of a condition precedent to the written agreement. Therefore, evidence of the owner and landscape architect's oral agreement is admissible because it demonstrated the existence of a condition precedent to the writing's taking effect.
(Line_2498): 118. Choice C is correct. The nonoccurrence of an express condition will discharge the contractual obligation of a party who is subject to the condition, unless the nonoccurrence of the condition has been waived by that party. Once the waiver has been given, it cannot be revoked where it is made after the time for the fulfillment of the condition has passed or where the other party has relied on the waiver. Therefore, although the express condition to the owner-architect agreement did not occur (since the necessary approval was not given), the owner waived the condition when the owner ordered the work to proceed. Since the waiver occurred after the nonoccurrence of the condition, and since the landscape architect relied on the waiver by completing 40% of the work, the owner may not revoke the waiver.
(Line_2499): 119. Answer A is correct. An obligor may delegate its duty under a contract to another unless the other party to the contract has a substantial interest in having the original obligor perform. Therefore, the expert may delegate its duty under its contract with the builder unless the builder has a substantial interest in having the expert (and not the man) perform the contract.
(Line_2500): 120. Answer A is correct. Unless the other party to the contract (the obligee) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor. Although the builder orally agreed to accept the delegation of the expert's duties to the man, that agreement did not effect a novation, or a release of the expert's obligation under the contract.
(Line_2501): 121. Answer A is correct. A court may grant specific performance of a contractual obligation where an award of monetary damages is inadequate - in other words, where damages would not be a just or reasonable substitute for performance of the promise, or where calculation of adequate damages would be impracticable. Because the brother promised to pay support to their mother and not to the sister, calculating damages to measure the sister's injury for breach of that promise would be impossible to ascertain. B is incorrect because the increased burden to the sister in and of itself would not be a sufficient reason for granting specific performance. C is incorrect because, although typically breach of a promise to pay money will give rise to an adequate damage recovery, it does not necessarily follow that specific performance is never available for breach of a promise to pay money. D is incorrect because the absence of economic harm to the sister should not preclude recovery for breach of contract.
(Line_2502): 122. Answer B or C is correct. A party's obligation under a contract may be discharged on grounds of mutual mistake if the mistake related to a basic assumption of the contract having a material effect on the exchange, and if the party seeking discharge should not bear the risk of the mistake. Similarly, a party's obligation under a contract may be discharged on grounds of supervening impracticability if the impracticability is due to an event, the nonoccurrence of which is a basic assumption of the contract, occurring without the fault of either party, and where the party seeking discharge should not bear the risk of the event. Because the federal statute criminalizes the performance required under the contract (the interstate sale of assault rifles), it relates to a basic assumption of the contract and renders performance impracticable for both the retailer and the wholesaler. Because neither party had reason to know that the statute would be in effect, neither party should bear the risk of the event.
(Line_2503): 123. Answer A is correct. A promise to perform a pre-existing legal duty is not sufficient consideration to support a return promise. Since as of April 1, the man was already obligated to pay the friend $1000 at 8% interest, normally a promise to do the same would not be sufficient consideration to support the friend's promise to refrain from suit. However, the friend's right to sue on the debt was to be barred by the statute of limitations as of June 30. Since the effect of the April 1 agreement was to revive an obligation that would otherwise have become time-barred, the man's promise was sufficient consideration to support the friend's obligation.
(Line_2504): 124. Answer D is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's obligation under a contract is conditioned upon substantial performance of the other party's obligation under the same agreement. In other words, a material breach of an obligation has the effect of discharging the other party's obligation. Therefore, the man's obligation to pay the note in full was conditioned upon the friend refraining from bringing suit on the note. The friend breached that obligation on May 1, and therefore the man's obligation is no longer enforceable.
(Line_2505): 125. Answer C is correct. Generally, a promise to guarantee a debt to a third person falls under the Statute of Frauds and therefore must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged in order to be enforceable. However, the promise will not fall under the statute where the principal purpose of making the guarantee was to benefit the promisor himself. Therefore, if the father's promise was made for the primary purpose of benefiting his daughter, then his promise to guarantee his daughter's debt falls within the statute of frauds. Because the promise was made verbally, there is no signed writing to satisfy the requirements of the statute. Answer A is incorrect because consideration was given to the daughter.
(Line_2506): 126. Answer B is correct. Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, an unequivocal statement of unwillingness or inability to perform a future contractual obligation, if material, may be treated as a total breach of that obligation and give rise to a right to immediately recover damages for that breach. A repudiation of a duty will not operate as a total breach, however, if it occurs after the repudiating party has received all of the agreed exchange for that duty. In such a case, the non-repudiating party must wait until the obligation becomes due before enforcing it. Although the borrower failed to make three repayments of the debt and expressed her inability to repay the debt in the future, the lender cannot accelerate the debt unless the contract specified otherwise. Therefore, the lender can only recover for the three months of unpaid debt that is due and outstanding as of January 15.
(Line_2507): 127. D is the correct answer. The father's letter to the lender was a unilateral contract, accepted upon performance. Therefore, when the lender made the loan to the borrower on the 15th, the contract was effectively accepted even if the father had not yet been notified. Thus, the father's death on the 16th does nothing to render the promise made in his letter to the lender ineffective, and II and III could not be a defense for the father's estate. Additionally, lack of consideration is not a defense because there was valid consideration; the requirement of a benefit to the father as the promisor is broad enough to encompass his getting what he wants - namely, that his daughter be given a loan. Thus, neither, I, II, nor III creates a defense for the father's estate.
(Line_2508): 128. Answer D is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of extrinsic evidence of certain statements made prior to the adoption of a final written agreement. Evidence of course-of-performance, however, is admissible to interpret a writing so long as the evidence can reasonably be construed in a way that is consistent with the writing. Because the written agreement between the manufacturer and the retailer is silent on the issue of returning undefective radios for credit, evidence of the parties' performance during the first three years of the agreement on this issue is admissible to interpret the writing.
(Line_2509): 129. Answer B is correct. Under the rules of accord and satisfaction, a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute by offering a check marked "payment in full." If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have understood it, and if the amount owed to the creditor is an unliquidated sum, then cashing the check without protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt. Although mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the accord, consideration is furnished where the amount owed to the creditor is genuinely in dispute. Because there was a good faith dispute between the retailer and the manufacturer relating to the amount that the retailer owed, the check that was sent to settle the dispute furnished sufficient consideration to support the manufacturer's implicit promise to discharge the debt.
(Line_2510): 130. Answer A is correct. A unilateral modification of a contract (such as the woman's promise to pay an additional $200 for the same work) lacks consideration because of the preexisting duty rule. However some unilateral modifications may be enforceable notwithstanding the lack of additional consideration if the modification was done in good faith in light of circumstances that the parties did not anticipate at the time the contract was formed. Because the painter should have anticipated the circumstances that required his hiring an extra worker, the modification is not enforceable and the woman is not bound by her promise to pay the extra $200. B is incorrect because the promise viewed in the context of the painter's demand was sufficiently definite. C is incorrect because unjust enrichment is not applicable where the benefit has been conferred pursuant to a binding contract. D is incorrect because the facts do not show that performance was impossible.
(Line_2511): 131. Answer B is correct. When the existence of a specific thing (such as the owner's office) is necessary for the performance of a contractual obligation, the destruction of that thing is a supervening event that relates to a basic assumption of the contract; this effectively discharges any obligation of either party under that contract. However, any benefit conferred under the contract prior to the supervening event may be recovered in restitution. Therefore, the destruction of the owner's office discharged the painter's obligation to paint and the owner's obligation to pay for the work. Payment for the work that was already done, however, is nonetheless recoverable in restitution, or quasi contract. Answer A is incorrect because the painter can recover in restitution. Answer C is incorrect because both parties' obligations are effectively discharged. Answer D is incorrect because generally a party cannot recover for reliance damages when a contract has been discharged on grounds of impossibility.
(Line_2512): 132. Answer A is correct. Where a clerical error has been made in reducing an agreement to writing, a party may bring an action in equitable reformation to have the writing reformed to correct the writing or include an omitted provision. The parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence to show the mistake that forms the basis for reformation. Because the seller and the buyer verbally agreed that the boundary of Greenacre was the fence, the writing may be reformed if it mistakenly includes a reference to the two acres beyond the fence. B, C and D are incorrect because reformation is not available to correct a mistake unless the parties actually reached an agreement prior to reducing the agreement to writing.
(Line_2513): 133. Answer D is correct. Under the UCC, an order to buy goods "for prompt shipment" is interpreted as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by a prompt shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods. Where the goods delivered fail to conform to the contract, the buyer may reject the goods if the rejection is made within a reasonable time after delivery. When the buyer ordered 500 bushels of peaches "for prompt shipment," the seller accepted by shipping No. 2 (rather than No. 1) Royal Fuzz peaches, and therefore the buyer has the right to reject them. Answers A and B are incorrect because the prompt shipment will be interpreted as an acceptance even if the goods are non-conforming. Answer C is incorrect because although a contract was formed, the buyer has the right to reject non-conforming goods.
(Line_2514): 134. Answer C is correct. Although contract rights generally are freely assignable, when a contract right is assigned to a party gratuitously (i.e., without receiving anything in exchange), the assignor retains the power to revoke the assignment unless and until the assignee obtains performance from the obligor. On June 15, the creditor made a gratuitous assignment to the niece of her right to collect $1,000 from the debtor. Because the assignment was a gift, the creditor retained the power to revoke the assignment, which she did when she accepted without objection the $1,000 payment from the debtor.B is incorrect because a novation did not occur on these facts. D is incorrect because contract rights are freely assignable except in very limited circumstances, such as where assignment would materially change the duty of the obligor.
(Line_2515): 135. Answer B is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of evidence of an agreement made prior to the adoption of a final written contract if the prior agreement relates to matters within the scope of the writing. However, if the prior agreement does not contradict the writing but merely supplements it, evidence of the prior agreement may be admitted if the court finds that the writing is only partially integrated (it did not encompass their entire agreement). Since the written agreement between the rancher and the fancier provides for the sale of a gray horse, evidence of an oral agreement to sell a brown horse contradicts the writing and would therefore be excluded under the rule. On the other hand, evidence relating to the rancher's alleged promise to include a saddle merely supplements the writing, and therefore a court is likely to consider extrinsic evidence on this issue if it finds that the writing is only partially integrated rather than completely integrated.
(Line_2516): 136. Answer B is correct. When a party has committed only a partial (as opposed to a total) breach of a contract, the other party to the contract remains obligated to perform, and refusal to perform will give the partially-breaching party the right to either specific performance or damages for total breach. Because the facts suggest that timely delivery of possession of Greenacre is not of the essence in this agreement, the two-week delay is only a partial breach, and therefore the farmer's refusal to pay the purchase price was a repudiation which justified an action by the landowner for specific performance.Choice D is incorrect because contracts involving the sale of land have historically been regarded as unique and therefore equitable relief has traditionally been allowed, even where the breaching party is the buyer.
(Line_2517): 137. Answer C is correct. Where a partial breach of contract occurs, the non-breaching party remains obligated to perform the contract but may recover damages for the partial breach. Consequential damages for breach of contract are limited to those that the breaching party had reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach at the time that the contract was made. When the landowner delivered possession of Greenacre 15 days after the time specified in the contract, he committed a partial breach, entitling the farmer to damages for the loss to him resulting from the delay. Because the landowner had no reason to know of the farmer's intended use of the land, the landowner is not obligated to pay damages for the cost of renting another pasture. The landowner is, however, obligated to pay the fair rental value of Greenacre for the 15-day period of delay. Choice D is incorrect because the $2,000 cost of renting another pasture was not reasonably foreseeable to the landowner and therefore not recoverable as consequential damages.
(Line_2518): 138. Answer A is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise. A party is an intended beneficiary of a promise if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intent of the parties, such as where the promisor must know that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The collector is only an incidental beneficiary of the broker-hoarder contract because the facts suggest that, in agreeing to sell the rare coin to the broker on February 1, the hoarder did not intend to confer a benefit on the collector.
(Line_2519): 139. Answer C is correct. A contract may be rescinded on grounds of mutual mistake of fact if the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract and has a material effect on the exchange, unless the court determines that the party asserting mistake should bear the risk of the mistake. As one who is engaged in the business of excavation and who had the opportunity but failed to investigate the condition of the ground to be excavated, the builder should assume the risk that the ground included granite.
(Line_2520): 140. Answer D is correct. Under the theory of detrimental reliance, a gratuitous promise may be enforceable notwithstanding lack of consideration if the party making the promise has reason to expect the promise will induce reliance on the part of the promisee, there has been reliance in fact, and injustice may be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The uncle should have foreseen that his promise would induce action on the spendthrift's part, and the spendthrift did in fact rely on the promise. However, the nature of the spendthrift's reliance (buying a car that he could not afford) is inconsistent with the intended purpose of the uncle's gift, which suggests that justice does not require enforcement of the promise.
(Line_2521): 141. Answer B is correct. Unless the promisor has given an option promise supported by consideration, generally an offer is freely revocable until the time of acceptance. However, an offer may be irrevocable to the extent necessary to avoid injustice if the offeror should reasonably expect the offer to induce substantial reliance on the part of the offeree and where there is reliance in fact. The terms of the wallpaper hanger's offer suggest that the wallpaper hanger expected the general contractor to rely on his bid by utilizing it in calculating the general contractor's overall bid, and the general contractor in fact did rely on his bid. The fact that the general contractor was required to submit a bid bond to guarantee her bid demonstrates the substantial nature of the general contractor's reliance, because it shows the general contractor cannot pass the additional wallpapering cost on to the owner. Therefore this fact, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor's case for recovery.
(Line_2522): 142. Answer D is correct. A contract may be rescinded on grounds of unilateral mistake if the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract that has a material effect on the exchange, if the party asserting mistake should not bear the risk of the mistake and if either (i) the non-mistaken party has reason to know of the mistake or (ii) the effect of the mistake would make enforcement of the contract unconscionable. The wallpaper hanger may argue that the sub-contract should be rescinded on grounds of the $4,000 mistake that he made in computing his sub-bid. If the general contractor had reason to know of the computational error, this would greatly support the wallpaper hanger's argument. Choice A is incorrect because the bid may be found to be irrevocable on a reliance theory even in the absence of an option promise supported by consideration. B is incorrect because it is irrelevant. C is incorrect because the mere fact that the general contractor would make a substantial profit on the contract does not make the effect of the mistake unconscionable.
(Line_2523): 143. Answer B is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise, such as where the promisor knows that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary unless and until the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if he materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise before receiving notice of the discharge. The son is an intended beneficiary of the Widow-Nirvana contract, since Nirvana knew of the widow's intent to give the Mark XX Rolls-Royce to her son. The son's rights as an intended beneficiary under the contract vested when he sold his expensive sports car at a discounted price.
(Line_2524): 144. Answer C is correct. Under the UCC, a modification to a contract for the sale of goods needs no additional consideration to be binding if the modification was made in good faith. Although the modification increasing the purchase price under the tool maker-manufacturer contract was unilateral, and therefore not supported by consideration, the modification was made in light of unexpected increased production costs, which suggests that it was proposed in good faith rather than to coerce the manufacturer into paying a higher price. Answer A is incorrect because of the UCC rule dispensing with consideration for good faith modifications. Answers B and D are incorrect because the facts do not show either detrimental reliance or unconscionability.
(Line_2525): 145. Answer C is correct. Under the common law, a unilateral modification of a contract is unenforceable for lack of consideration (since performance of a pre-existing duty is not sufficient consideration to support the modification). As an exception to the common law rule, a unilateral modification that is fair and equitable and made in light of circumstances not anticipated at the time that the contract was concluded will be binding. Since the construction company's proposal to increase the contract price to $520,000 was made in light of unexpected circumstances (his encounter with solid rock), and since the price increase accurately reflected the increased cost of excavating rock, the construction company should recover the modified contract price.Choice A is incorrect because it fails to take into account the exception to the common law rule.
(Line_2526): 146. Answer D is correct. The general damages rule for measuring loss to an owner for breach of a construction contract is that owner is entitled to damages in an amount equivalent to the cost to complete the work as promised. An exception to the rule is where cost to complete damages would be grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the performance contracted for, in which case damages will be limited to the diminution in market value of the construction due to the defect. Although the fair market value of the warehouse and the defective driveway exceeds the contract price, the warehouse owner nonetheless is entitled to the cost to complete damages, because these damages fairly reflect his loss resulting from the defective construction. The warehouse owner therefore was justified in withholding $30,000 from the contract price paid to the construction company.
(Line_2527): 147. Answer A is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of evidence of a prior agreement that contradicts the terms of a final written contract. Notwithstanding the parol evidence rule, however, such evidence may be introduced to explain an ambiguity in the written contract. The written contract between the tire salesman and the county provided for the sale to the county of "all tires required by this agreement." It is not clear whether this language manifests an intent by the parties to enter into a requirements contract, which is a type of sales contract that obligates the buyer to purchase all of its requirements of a good from the seller. Because the written contract is ambiguous on this issue, the advertisement may be admitted to demonstrate that the county was not obligated to purchase tires exclusively from the tire salesman.
(Line_2528): 148. Answer B is correct. Under the UCC, a contract for the sale of a good that measures the quantity by the requirements of the buyer for that good means such actual requirements that may occur in good faith. At a minimum this means that the buyer must purchase all of its requirements for the good exclusively from the seller. If the court concludes that the tire salesman-county contract is a requirements contract, then the fact that the county is buying some of its tires from a competitor would mean that the county has breached the requirements contract, entitling the tire salesman to damages. A is incorrect because the contracts clause is not at issue. C is incorrect because the UCC rules regarding requirements contracts make clear that such agreements impose binding obligations on both the buyer and the seller. D is incorrect because, although the quantity term in a requirements contract is flexible, it is sufficiently definite for a court to enforce.
(Line_2529): 149. Answer A is correct. In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by bargained-for consideration. Consideration is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise. The retailer's promise to give his daughter the car was supported by consideration because the promise was conditioned upon the daughter's promise to pay her father $3,000. Answer B is incorrect because moral obligation does not suffice as consideration. Answer C is incorrect because courts at law do not inquire into the adequacy of considerations exchanged. Answer D is incorrect because the fact that the car was sold to a third party does not discharge the retailer's contractual obligation to sell the car to his daughter, although the daughter may be limited to recovering monetary damages.
(Line_2530): 150. Answer D is correct. In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by bargained-for consideration. Consideration is bargained for if it is given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. It does not matter that the promisee may have benefited from the requested performance, or that her motives for furnishing the requested performance were different from the promisor's, so long as the promisee restrained her freedom of action in some way in reliance on the promise. Because the employee's right to collect the $100 is conditioned upon her running the mile in under six minutes, the business owner's promise is enforceable so long as the employee furnishes the requested act

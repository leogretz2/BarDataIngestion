How to Use This Book
This  book  contains  a  collection  of  questions  (called  “items”)  in  the
Multistate  Bar  Exam  format,  accompanied  by  answers  (called  “options”)
and  explanations.  Each  of  the  explanations  is  intended  to  be  a  mini-
dissertation on the topic involved.

The chapter entitled Strategies & Tactics: Playing the MBE Game to
Win (what we call the Multistate Method) sets forth a detailed method for
approaching  and  dealing  with  items  in  this  format.  You  should  study  the
chapter diligently before beginning to practice with the items that follow it.
By the time you have worked your way through 50 or 60 items, you should
have become so familiar with this Multistate Method that its use is second
nature.

The  questions  are  divided  into  the  seven  subject  areas  tested  on  the
Multistate  Bar  Examination:  Civil  Procedure,  Constitutional  Law,
Contracts, Criminal Law, Evidence, Real Property, and Torts. If you are still
in law school, you can use the separate sections to review the material that
you are studying in each of the subject areas. Each section is accompanied
by a subject matter outline and a question index. Using the question index,
you can look for questions dealing with the particular topics and subtopics
that you wish to review.

The items that appear in this book are similar in content and form to the
questions  that  appear  on  the  Multistate  Bar  Examination  (MBE).  On  the
MBE,  each  item  tests  only  one  general  subject  area  but  is  likely  to  cover
several topics and subtopics within that area. A Torts question, for example,
may test knowledge of intentional torts, negligence, nuisance, and proximate
cause, all in the same set of answers (options).

For  this  reason,  most  questions  (items)  in  this  book  may  be  listed  in
several  different  places  in  the  question  index.  If  you  have  just  completed
your  study  of  intentional  torts  and  wish  to  field  questions  that  test  your
newly acquired knowledge, you can find them by looking at the appropriate
place in the Torts question index. You may discover, however, that the same
questions also test knowledge of topics that you have not yet studied. This
need not prevent the questions from being useful to you.

The Multistate Method game plan suggests that, in answering Multistate
items, you treat each option (i.e., proposed answer) as a separate true-false
question. Using this approach, you can choose to deal only with the options

7

for  which  your  studies  have  prepared  you.  The  explanation  accompanying
each item analyzes why the answer we pick is correct and why each of the
incorrect  options  is  incorrect.  You  can  use  these  analyses  to  check  your
responses to the options.

If you are preparing for the MBE, you should work on the items in each
of  the  subject  areas  after  completing  your  review  of  those  areas.  If  your
review has not prepared you for all the options, you will know what areas
need further review. The explanations can help you complete your study.

In  addition,  this  book  contains  a  200-question  practice  exam  in  which
the items are shuffled, as they are on the MBE, so that the seven subjects are
tested in random order. If you need additional questions to review, or want
Strategies & Tactics on each MBE subject, you should purchase a copy of
Strategies & Tactics for the MBE, also published by Aspen and available
at your local bookstore. For each MBE subject, Strategies & Tactics for the
MBE delivers detailed advice on what to study and what traps to watch for,
as well as actual released MBE questions with detailed answers.

For substantive MBE review, you should check out the Law in a Flash
MBE Set, which contains flash cards on all MBE subjects (Civil Procedure,
Constitutional Law, Contracts, Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure [tested on
the MBE as part of Criminal Law], Evidence, Future Interests [tested as part
of Property], Real Property, Sales [tested as part of Contracts], and Torts)
as  well  as  a  copy  of  Strategies  &  Tactics  for  the  MBE.  The  MBE  Set  is
available at your local bookstore.

If  you  are  preparing  for  the  bar  exam,  you  should  wait  until  you  have
completed  your  review  of  all  seven  Multistate  subjects  before  taking  the
practice  exam  contained  in  this  book.  It  may  be  a  good  idea  to  simulate
examination conditions when taking it. Turn off your phone, lock your door,
tell the rest of the world to go away, and give yourself three uninterrupted
hours for each half of the exam.

GOOD LUCK!

Strategies 

& Tactics®—Playing the MBE Game
to Win

TERROR AND THE MBE

It's given on the last Wednesday of February and July in almost every

one of the 50 states, and it has become a significant factor in the bar
admitting standards of most states. It evokes loathing and paranoia from the
souls of embryonic attorneys across the land. It's the Multistate Bar
Examination (the MBE), an all-day challenge consisting of 200 questions on
seven important subjects. It scares the devil out of most of us.

The reason it's so frightening to us is that our profession attracts people
who learned as they were growing up that they could talk their way into and
argue their way out of most situations. I'm one of these people. You
probably are, too. Much of the time, people like us treat life as a game. The
trouble with the MBE is that it doesn't give us a chance to talk or argue,
which is what we believe we do best. We find it too structured, too
restrictive. There's not enough game in it. It cramps our style.

When we think that, though, we're forgetting that the people who create

the MBE are cut from the same cloth as we are. They are law professors
and practitioners who have argued their way into and out of trouble all their
lives. They've been playing the same game with their lives that we've been
playing with ours. The ideas that appeal to them also appeal to us. The only
difference is that they specialize in testing and finding out what other
lawyers are made of. Their exam does a pretty good job of it, but we have
to approach it the way we approach other problems in our lives—as a game
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
that must be played from a position of strength.

It helps to realize that, by its very nature, the MBE has certain aspects
that work in our favor. First, because it is given in most of the states, it can
test only general principles of law—no petty details. Second, because its
multiple choice format eliminates the options of argument or explanation,
each issue must be so precisely drawn that only one of the four possible
answers satisfies the requirements of the question. Most important, because
it is given to budding lawyers, the most argumentative and litigious people

in the world, it must be scrupulously fair and unassailable.

To assure that the exam will be just and to protect it against attack, the
creators of the MBE have developed a method for constructing questions.
They stick to a policy that requires that there be no trick questions and no
trick answers. No problem will be solved on the basis of a subtle turn of
word or phrase. They even have rules to assure the effective use of
apostrophes and to eliminate the confusing misuse of pronouns. Questions
are screened repeatedly before they are used, and then screened again.

After the exam has been given, the answers are analyzed. Questions that

proved too tricky to be fair are invalidated and eliminated from further
consideration. Questions that show themselves to have no correct answer or
more than one correct answer are also invalidated. Applicants are not
supposed to be asked to select the best of four bad answers or four good
answers. There is only one demonstrably correct answer to each question.
The others are clearly incorrect. That is, it's clear if we follow the right
analytical steps.

Since they have a method for creating the exam, we need a method for
taking it. This chapter provides a unique Multistate Method. To develop our
method, we must begin by understanding theirs.

STRUCTURE OF QUESTIONS

Questions, or “items,” as the examiners call them, can be broken into

three distinct parts: the root, the stem, and the options.

The root is the part of the item containing the underlying facts.

The stem is the part of the item containing the call of the options or
assigning a task. Sometimes it is in the form of a question; sometimes it calls
for the completion of a sentence.

The options are the answer choices. Sometimes they state conclusions
and nothing more; sometimes they link a conclusion with a reason to support
it. Sometimes two or more of the options seem to be related to each other;
sometimes each of the four is independent of the other three. One of them is
always the correct option; three of them are always incorrect.

Exhibit A shows a typical item.

DISTRACTORS AND FOILS

The examiners spend a lot of time and energy creating three wrong

10

options for each item. They call the incorrect options “distractors” or
“foils.” In using those names, they have unwittingly tipped their hand.
According to Webster, a “distractor” is something that compellingly and
confusingly attracts in the wrong direction. A “foil” is something that serves
to set off another thing to advantage or disadvantage by contrasting with it.
By definition, some of the incorrect options are there to make the others
look good, and some of them are there to make the correct option seem bad.

Here, again, the nature of the exam works in our favor. The examination

is supposed to be a test of knowledge. The correct choice must be
somewhere among the four options, but it can't be left exposed for everyone
to see; it has to be hidden. According to their own rules, the examiners can't
use tricky devices or puzzling language, so they have to hide it behind a
screen of distractors and foils. Like a magician's banter, these are designed
to make us look away from the real action. That's how the game is played.

Many of the people who create the MBE are law professors or former
law professors. In creating distractors and foils, they use insight that comes
from their experience with law students. After all, the main purpose of the
exam is to find out whether we are finished studying the law and ready to
start practicing it. Their foils and distractors are usually based on
anticipating the errors that law students are likely to make.

11

Their method gives all the options a look of superficial plausibility. At
first glance, every option appears to be correct. Our response to their bag of
tricks must therefore include a careful reading of the language that they use.

Incomplete definitions and arguments

No one needs to be more precise in the use of language than a lawyer.

Learning to communicate precisely is one of the goals of a law school
education. A first-semester law student may define “murder” as the
unjustified killing of a human being, but a lawyer knows that an
unjustified killing isn't murder unless it's an unjustified killing of another
human being with malice aforethought.

Some of the foils and distractors that appear on the MBE consist of
incomplete or imprecise statements, like those made by beginners in the
classroom. An option that says, “John is guilty of murder because he
committed the unjustified killing of a human being,” is wrong because it
is based on an incomplete definition. Don't assume that the examiners left
out the rest of the definition by mistake, or that they expect you to know
what they really mean. Don't allow yourself to complete the argument or
definition in your mind and conclude that it is correct.

Dealing with the facts

Lawyers must be very careful with facts. They must assume nothing in

addition to what has been established or given. In summing up to a jury,
for example, trial counsel may not refer to any facts that have not been
proven. Frequently, distractors and foils are designed to find out whether
we have the ability to play the game the way a lawyer plays it. If a
prosecutor proved only that the defendant shot the victim and that the
victim died an hour later, the defendant's prosecution for murder would
have to be dismissed unless the prosecutor had also proven that the
defendant's bullet caused the victim's death. If the facts in the root of the
item do not say that the victim died as a result of the defendant's bullet,
don't assume or infer that she did. Only a medical expert is competent to
draw such a conclusion, and you are probably not a doctor. Without such
proof, we must conclude that the defendant's guilt has not been
established.

On the other hand, lawyers can't get away with ignoring facts that
have been established. In arguing appeals, for example, lawyers may not
claim that the facts proven at the trial should be ignored. They are
restricted to making arguments about the legal effects of the proven facts.

12

Since examiners are out to determine whether we can do a lawyer's job,
they are likely to fill the root with implausible facts in an effort to trick us
into rejecting or disbelieving them. Falling for their ploy can be
disastrous. In taking the MBE, we must accept the facts that are given to
us, no matter how unlikely or implausible they may seem.

We may have been taught, for example, that an intoxicated person is

not capable of driving her car in a reasonable manner. If, however, an
item's root tells us that after the defendant drank two quarts of whiskey,
she was driving her car in a reasonable manner when she collided with
the plaintiff, we must accept this as true. Since negligence is
unreasonable conduct, and since we are told that the defendant was
driving her car in a reasonable manner, we must conclude that she was
not negligent.

Common errors

Some areas of the law are so confusing to law students that they
furnish the examiners with a fertile field in which to cultivate foils and
distractors. The literature distributed by the examiners indicates that
incorrect options contained in MBE items are frequently based on
common errors made by law students. Often, these common errors result
from misunderstandings about the significance of legal expressions that
have different meanings for lawyers than for laypersons.

The doctrine of “last clear chance” is an example of how this
common confusion can be used to create an effective foil or distractor.
“Last clear chance” is a doctrine that can be raised only by a plaintiff; its
only effect is to eliminate the consequence of the plaintiff's contributory
negligence. Thus, even in a jurisdiction that applies the “all-or-nothing”
rule of contributory negligence, a plaintiff who goes to sleep in the
middle of the road and is struck by a defendant who sees her in time but
fails to take reasonable steps to avoid striking her may still win her case.
In finding for the plaintiff, the court is likely to say that the plaintiff's
negligence does not bar her recovery because the defendant had the “last
clear chance” to avoid the accident.

Knowing that many students are confused about this doctrine, the
examiners may create a distractor that says, “The defendant wins because
the plaintiff had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.” It sounds
logical, but not to someone who understands that “last clear chance” is a
doctrine available only to plaintiffs.

13

Similarly, a foil or distractor may be based on the “dead man's rule,”

which excludes evidence of certain conversations with a person now
deceased. Although the “dead man's rule” sometimes keeps evidence out,
it never justifies the admission of evidence. Thus, an option that says,
“The evidence is admissible under the dead man's rule” has to be
incorrect, even though at first glance it sounds logical.

Overlooking the obvious

Some lawyers lose cases because they overlook the obvious. Perhaps

that's why the examiners occasionally create an option that is so
obviously correct that there is no rational excuse for missing it. It's
amazing how many applicants reject such an option in the belief that
nothing so important could possibly be so easy.

Items regarding the sufficiency of a deed description are good
examples of this technique. The general rule is that a description in a
deed is sufficient if it adequately identifies the realty conveyed. Usually,
it is impossible to decide whether a description satisfies this requirement
without knowing something about surveying in general and the
geographical area involved in particular. Since the MBE is not a test of
surveying or geographical knowledge, however, its creators cannot
expect us to determine the validity of a particular description. Instead,
they are likely to give the language of a deed description, tell you that it
adequately identifies the realty conveyed, ask whether it is valid, and then
create an option that says, “The description is valid because it adequately
identifies the realty conveyed.” Can anything be more obviously correct?
Don't miss a gift like that one.

Plausible creations

Some applicants are so intimidated by the examination process that
they are sure the correct options will involve concepts they never heard
of before. This not only leads them to reject options that are obviously
correct, it causes them to select options that consist of meaningless
garbage. Knowing this, the examiners occasionally indulge their sense of
whimsy by building foils and distractors around Latin words or phrases
that sound momentous but are used in a context that makes them
meaningless.

Post hoc ergo propter hoc is an example of a Latin phrase that may

be at the core of one of these seemingly plausible creations. The
expression translates as “after which, therefore because of which,” and is

14

a name given to the error in reasoning that leads people to offer such
arguments as “It always rains after I wash my car, so washing my car
makes it rain” (i.e., it rains after (and, therefore, because) I wash my car).
This is likely to show up as a foil or distractor in an option that says
something like, “John will win under the doctrine of post hoc ergo
propter hoc.”

If that kind of bluff fools us, we will end up at the examiners' mercy.
In a question that actually appeared on a past MBE, many applicants were
taken in by a double-talk option that stated that a plaintiff could not be the
holder of a certain easement because “an incorporeal hereditament lies
only in grant.” One way to avoid falling for such seemingly plausible
creations is to remember that after passing all your law school finals,
taking a bar review course, and cramming for the exam, you probably are
familiar with any rule of law that will matter to the examiners. If an
option cites a doctrine or rule that you never heard of, it's probably
incorrect.

Unfamiliar phrases

This doesn't mean that all the correct options will use familiar

language. One of the goals of the exam is to determine whether we really
understand the law that we've learned or whether we've just been trained
like parrots to spout phrases. To accomplish this goal, the examiners may
describe familiar concepts in nontraditional words. Instead of saying, for
example, that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care
because he created a foreseeable risk to her, they may say, “The
defendant owed an obligation to the plaintiff because it appeared that the
defendant's conduct would injure her.” Instead of saying that strict
liability is imposed on one who engages in an ultra-hazardous activity,
they may say that “a defendant is liable without regard to fault because
his or her occupation is extremely dangerous.” Remember that there are
many ways of saying anything, and that substance is far more important
than form.

PLAYING THE RIGHT ROLE

In the real world, lawyers play various roles. Sometimes they are
judges, deciding the outcome of an issue or selecting the winner of a case.
Sometimes they are advocates, making the best argument possible for one of
the parties, even though there's no telling whether that party is going to win.
Sometimes they are scholars, unconcerned about who wins or loses,

15

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

interested only in seeing the legal significance of a fact or in selecting the
most applicable rule of law, without caring whose interest will be served. It
is natural that the items appearing in the MBE game should cast us in each of
these three roles. This makes knowing how to act in each of the roles an
important part of our Multistate Method.

Acting as the judge

[Typical stem: If the plaintiff sues the defendant for battery, the court

should find in favor of . . . ]

In the real world, the judge starts out with no particular result or
conclusion in mind. He or she does not decide questions of fact but is
always alert for misstatements about the facts in lawyers' arguments. If an
argument does not accurately characterize the facts, is based on an
inference not justified by the facts, or is based on a rule of law that is not
correctly stated, the judge rejects it. He or she rules in favor of the
argument in which accurate statements about the facts and law are
consistent with the conclusion with which they are coupled.

When you are asked to act as judge, do not decide questions of fact.

Do not try to determine who should win or how the issue should be
resolved until you have considered all the arguments presented in the
options. Examine each option in turn. First, see whether the facts and law
are accurately stated. If not, reject the option. See whether the conclusion
offered is consistent with the argument advanced. If not, reject the option.
There will be only one option in which the argument advanced is based
on accurate statements of fact and law and is consistent with the
conclusion offered. This is the correct choice. Select it, even though you
may not like the result. After all, you're a judge.

Acting as the advocate

[Typical stem: Which of the following is the most effective argument

in favor of the defendant's position?]

Unlike the judge, the advocate works toward a particular result—the

one he or she's been paid or assigned to accomplish. It doesn't matter
whether he or she believes that the client will win. So long as there is any
question at all for either the judge or jury, he or she understands that a
client is entitled to representation. The advocate assumes that the client
can win and then makes the argument that is most likely to bring about the
victory. He or she doesn't invent facts but presents and interprets in the
light most favorable to the client those facts that have been established.

16

When an item asks you to be an advocate, examine each of the options

in turn to see whether the law is accurately stated and whether the
inferences on which the option is based are justified by the facts that are
given. If not, reject it. See whether the option presented could possibly
result in victory for the client the stem has assigned you to represent. If
not, reject it. There will be only one option in which the argument
advanced is based on accurate statements of law and fact and which
supports your client's position. Choose it, even if you don't really believe
that your client can win. After all, you're an advocate.

Acting as the scholar

[Typical stem: The interest in the land that the son had on the day after

the landowner's death is best described as a . . . ]

The scholar doesn't try to decide or influence the outcome of a case.
The scholar uses his or her knowledge of the law to recognize the legal
significance of a particular fact or to select the most applicable rule. He
or she sees an intellectual challenge and nothing more. Like a professor
asking a question in the classroom, he or she doesn't care who wins or
loses. He or she focuses on a specific and limited issue, listens to each of
the options chosen by the students, and then smiles at the student whose
choice comes closest to the one he or she had in mind when he or she
asked the question.

Do the same with an item that casts you in the role of a scholar. Forget

about who will win or lose. Don't worry whether the option you select
will result in justice. Just focus on the specific issues involved and try to
resolve them in your mind. Then examine each of the options carefully
and select the one that comes closest to the selection you have already
formulated.

TIMING

Our Multistate Method must teach the most efficient possible use of
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
time. Most people barely manage to answer all the items in the allotted time.
You probably will not have an opportunity to go back and check your
choices. It's wise to get them right on the first pass because that's probably
the only chance you will get.

According to the Examiners, seven subjects are tested. The test presents

200 questions total—28 questions in Contracts, and 27 questions each in
Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, Evidence, Real Property, Torts, and

17

Civil Procedure (10 questions are being “tested” by the Examiners that do
not form part of your score, but you won't be able to distinguish these
questions). You should recognize, however, that in reality, 10 law school
subjects are tested—the section on Contracts includes questions on Sales,
the section on Property includes questions on Future Interests, and the
section on Criminal Law includes questions on Criminal Procedure.

There are usually two or more versions of each exam so that, although
everyone gets the same questions, the questions are not in the same order.
They are randomly shuffled in each version. Therefore, you may see two
real property items in a row and then not see another until 10 or 20 items
later.

Everyone feels stronger in some of the subjects than in others, and there

will be a powerful temptation to go looking for those questions that deal
with your best subjects. Resist that temptation. Answer the questions in the
order in which they appear.

There are three good reasons why you should take this advice. First, the

tough ones aren't going to get any easier with the passage of time. If
anything, fatigue will make them seem even tougher, so there's no point in
putting them off. Second, if you read item #3, for example, and decide not to
answer it until later, part of your mind will still be working on it when you
try to answer subsequent items. This will keep you from devoting all your
energy to the item before you and may even cause you to base a choice in
one question on facts that you still remember from item #3. Third and most
important, if you skip item #3, there will be a blank space on your answer
sheet, and you may become confused into putting the answer to item #4 in
the space for item #3. Once you do that, every choice that follows will be
written in the wrong space.

This potential pitfall alone makes it better to guess than to leave a blank
space. But there's more. The examiners give you one point for every correct
choice and don't subtract any points for a wrong choice. This means that a
wrong choice is certainly no worse than a blank space. In most states, you
can get 60 or more wrong and still pass the exam. If you can't come up with
the correct option, guess and move ahead. You have at least a 25 percent
chance of guessing correctly.

After the exam is over, the examiners usually determine that some of the

items—sometimes as many as 10—were invalid. When this happens, they
often give credit for any option chosen. This means that you may receive a
point even if you guessed wrong. If you left it blank, though, you'll get

18

nothing.

You won't really be guessing anyway, because a “guess” is a choice that

is based on no real knowledge. By the time you get to the bar exam, your
head will be so filled with information that there won't be any item that you
don't know at least something about. Even if it's buried deep in the
unconscious recesses of your mind, this knowledge will increase the
probability that the option you choose is correct.

Time is not on your side. You'll have two three-hour sessions with 100
items in each. That breaks down to 33.3 items per hour, about 17 items per
half hour, or 1.8 minutes per item. It is important to stay on schedule. Each
item is worth one point. You don't get anything extra for the ones you spend
extra time on. Every extra second you spend on one item is a second less
that you'll have to spend on the next.

THE TEST BECOMES A GAME

After observing a courtroom proceeding for the first time, the layperson

typically scratches his or her temple and says, “It's a game. Nothing but a
game.” We, on the other hand, say it's serious business. But when we reflect
on the origins of the adversary system, we see knights in armor jousting on a
field of battle in the belief that the righteous was assured of winning the
contest.

It started out as a game, and we're kidding ourselves if we try to believe
that there isn't any game left in it. In a way, the phrase “adversary system” is
a euphemism for a complex and exciting game that society plays, with
lawyers as its game pieces. It is fitting, therefore, that the bar examination,
which tests competency to practice law, is, itself, a kind of game, testing,
among other things, the applicant's ability to play.

All games involve a combination of knowledge and strategy. A craps
shooter has no control over the numbers that come up on the dice; he or she
wins or loses by making bets based on his or her knowledge of the odds. A
card player decides “when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em” by knowing
what cards are in the deck and remembering which ones have already been
dealt. Trivial Pursuit champions win by moving their game pieces in the
most advantageous way, but they don't get to move them at all unless they
know the answers to the questions that appear on the game cards.

The MBE is a game that can't be won without knowledge but knowledge
isn't everything. Given enough time, any decent lawyer who approaches the
MBE seriously enough to prepare for it adequately can get a passing score.

19

But the exam is long and the hours are short. Without an effective strategy,
an applicant is likely to be cut down by the clock. Ding dong. Game over.

To avoid running out of time, move through every item as swiftly as

possible. To avoid being foiled and distracted, however, read every
relevant word patiently and carefully. At first, these goals seem to be
inconsistent with each other. By beginning with an orientation, our
Multistate Method provides us with a strategy for accomplishing both of
them.

ORIENTATION

The fact pattern in an item's root may raise dozens of issues, some of
which can be resolved and some of which won't ever be resolved. Usually,
however, the stem is more narrowly drawn to eliminate all but one or two of
the possible issues. If we waste time answering questions that weren't
asked, we won't have a chance of answering the ones that were.

To avoid being drawn in to a series of false directions, always begin

with a quick reading of the stem to determine the call of the question.
Look for the role that each stem assigns and the task that it sets before you. It
may specify a particular cause of action, it may name a crime, it may point
to a clause of the United States Constitution, or it may designate the parties,
plaintiff, and defendant.

After the stem, quickly read the root. We're still not ready to begin
choosing among the options, so we aren't sure what we're looking for, even
though the stem gave us a pretty good idea. This first reading of the root is
part of our orientation.

Don't struggle too hard at this point to understand all the facts. Don't
worry about keeping the chronology straight. Don't begin drawing those
little diagrams you learned about in law school or bar review. Some facts in
the root may not even be relevant to the options, and attempting to deal with
them at this point may turn out to be a waste of time. If necessary, you can
always return to the root to check the facts again.

MAKING THE PLAY

Our first reading of the stem and root was an orientation, designed to
find out what role we've been assigned to play and what task we've been
asked to accomplish. Now it's time to accomplish it. Read the stem again,
more carefully this time.

20

Basic game plan

Because the examiners' game plan includes options that make us look
in the wrong direction, our Multistate Method must adopt a game plan that
will keep us from being foiled and distracted. Since the wrong options
are supposed to make the other options look either good or bad by
comparison, don't compare one option to the others. Treat each as a
separate option and as if it were the only one before you. Recall that,
according to the examiners' policy, only one can be correct. To play it
safe, even if you have found one that you think is true, don't stop until you
have checked all four options.

With pencil in hand, examine each option carefully, returning to the
root to confirm facts if necessary. Mark the option with a “T” if it is true,
with an “F” if it is false, and with a “?” if you can't make up your mind.
When you're done, you should have three “F”s and one “T.” So long as
you have a good clear “T,” count “?”s as “F”s. If you have no “T”s at all,
treat a “?” as a “T.” The option with the “T” next to it is the correct
answer.

Although this basic game plan works for all MBE item types, there
are a few variations that may help us deal more efficiently with particular
kinds of items.

Negative response

Occasionally a stem asks for a “reverse” response, such as “Which of

the following is LEAST likely to violate the Fourteenth Amendment?”
When that happens, restate the stem in the reverse: “Would the following
violate the Fourteenth Amendment?” You should end up with three “T”s
(yes) and one “F” (no). Choose the one that got the “F.”

Overlapping options

Sometimes some of the options contain parts of others. Typical

options:

The defendant is guilty of
(A) Burglary only.
(B) Robbery only.
(C) Burglary and Robbery.
(D) Neither Burglary nor Robbery.

Instead of trying to deal with these overlapping options in
combination, break them down into the individual components (e.g.,

21

Burglary and Robbery). Give each of the individual choices a “T” or “F,”
and then find the option that contains the correct combination of choices.

Three-to-one options

In some items, three of the options offer one conclusion coupled with

different reasons for it, while the fourth offers the opposite conclusion
with no reason at all. A typical question:

The defendant will
(A) lose.
(B) win, because . . . .
(C) win, because . . . .
(D) win, because . . . .

Since the odd option is unaccompanied by a reason, it is impossible
to select it without eliminating the other three first. For this reason, when
confronted by a three-to-one options item, always consider the odd option
last. Then choose it only if all of the others have received “F”s.

What-if options

Sometimes the options offer additional facts and the stem calls for
selection of the fact pattern that would be most likely to bring about a
particular result. This kind of item is like the classroom game in which
the professor changes the facts in a case under discussion by saying,
“Now, what if . . . ?”

[Typical stem: Which of the following additional facts or inferences,

if it was the only one true, would be most likely to result in a judgment
for the plaintiff?]

It is important to remember that this kind of item does not require you
to decide whether the additional fact or inference in the “what if” option
is true; it directs you to assume that it is. If you encounter one of these,
combine the stem with each “what-if” option in turn, accepting as true the
facts that it contains. In assigning a “T” or “F,” don't ask whether the facts
are true or the inference is justified; assume that they are. Then decide
whether the existence of these additional facts or inferences would be
likely to bring about the particular result (e.g., in the previous item, ask,
“If this fact were true or this inference were justified, would it result in a
judgment for the plaintiff?”).

SELECTING THE CORRECT OPTION

22

Selecting the correct option is easy once you've placed three “F”s and
one “T” next to the given options. The hard part is deciding whether to give
an option a “T” or “F.” This becomes easier if an appropriate strategy is
applied. Although the MBE will present you with 800 options (i.e., four for
each question), all options fall into only two categories. Our Multistate
Method provides a strategy to use for each of the categories.

Simple options

Some options only state possible conclusions. These are called

“simple options.” Here's a typical simple-option item:

A man took a diamond ring to a pawnshop and borrowed $20 on it. It
was agreed that the loan was to be repaid within 60 days, and if it was
not, the pawnshop owner, the defendant, could sell the ring. A week
before the expiration of the 60 days, the defendant had an opportunity to
sell the ring to a customer for $125. He did so, thinking it was unlikely
that the man would repay the loan and that if he did, the defendant would
be able to handle him somehow, even by paying for the ring if necessary.
Two days later, the man came in with the money to reclaim his ring. The
defendant told him that it had been stolen when his shop was burglarized
one night and that therefore he was not responsible for its loss. 
Larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses are separate crimes in the
jurisdiction.

Which of the following crimes has the defendant most likely committed?

(A) Larceny.
(B) Embezzlement.
(C) Larceny by trick.
(D) Obtaining by false pretenses.

These options are “simple” rather than “complex,” but not “simple”

rather than “difficult.” Since nothing is given but a bare conclusion,
simple options usually require the most work. In dealing with each simple
option, it is necessary to remember the essential elements of whatever
rule of law is applicable and to check the root to see whether every one
of those elements is satisfied by the facts given.

In the previous example, to decide whether to mark option (A) with a

“T” or “F,” it is first necessary to remember that larceny is the
trespassory taking and carrying off of personal property known to be
another's with the intent to permanently deprive. Then it is necessary to
return to the root to see whether the defendant trespassorily took the ring,
whether he carried it off, whether he knew that the ring belonged to
another, and whether he had the intent to permanently deprive. The option

23

can receive a “T” only if all the elements of the crime are satisfied by the
facts.

In the real world, it is likely that some of these elements will raise

questions of fact for a jury to determine or questions of law that
ultimately will be decided by an appellate court. Different juries may
come up with different answers to the questions of fact, and different
appellate courts may come up with different answers to the questions of
law. An MBE item must have three options that are clearly incorrect,
however, and one that is clearly correct. This means that the facts must be
structured so as to make it clear that at least one of the elements of the
rule applicable in each option is unsatisfied.

In the previous example, the defendant's act cannot be larceny (option

A) because there was clearly no trespassory taking. A defendant
trespassorily takes when he or she receives possession contrary to the
rights of the owner. Since the defendant received possession of the ring
lawfully, with the man's consent, and with no improper purpose, he did
not trespassorily take it and cannot be guilty of larceny. Larceny by trick
(option C) is committed by fraudulently obtaining temporary possession
of personal property known to be another's. Since the defendant was not
planning to do so when he obtained the ring from the man, he cannot be
guilty of larceny by trick. Obtaining by false pretenses (option D) is
committed by fraudulently inducing another to transfer title to a chattel.
Since the man never transferred title to the ring, the defendant cannot be
guilty of obtaining it by false pretenses. As can be seen, options A, C, and
D are clearly incorrect.

At the same time, the facts must establish that all the elements of the
rule supporting the correct option are satisfied. Embezzlement (option B)
is committed by criminally converting property of which the defendant
has lawful custody. Since the man delivered the ring to the defendant
before the defendant developed the intent to steal it, the defendant's
custody was clearly lawful. Because only a person with the right to do so
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
is entitled to sell a chattel, and because the defendant did not have the
right to sell it, his sale of the ring was clearly a criminal conversion.
Since all the elements of embezzlement are clearly satisfied, (B) must be
the correct option.

Complex options

Most of the time, an option will consist of two parts: a conclusion and a

24

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

reason giving rise to the conclusion. Here's a typical complex-option item:

The plaintiff was eating in a restaurant when he began to choke on a
piece of food that had lodged in his throat. The defendant, a physician
who was dining at a nearby table, did not wish to become involved and
did not render any assistance, although prompt medical attention would
have been effective in removing the obstruction from the plaintiff's
throat. Because of the failure to obtain prompt medical attention, the
plaintiff suffered severe brain injury from lack of oxygen. The
jurisdiction had a statute that relieved physicians of malpractice liability
for emergency first aid. When the defendant saw the plaintiff choking, he
knew the plaintiff was substantially certain to sustain serious injury.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for his injuries, the
court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the defendant did not cause the piece of

food to lodge in the plaintiff's throat.

(B)  the  plaintiff,  because  a  reasonably  prudent  person  with  the
defendant's  experience,  training,  and  knowledge  would  have
assisted the plaintiff.

(C)  the  plaintiff,  because  the  jurisdiction  has  a  statute  which
relieves physicians of malpractice liability for emergency first
aid.

(D) the defendant, because the defendant knew that the plaintiff was

substantially certain to sustain serious injury.

“Because” as a conjunction

It is important to understand what an option built around the

conjunction “because” or its synonym “since” means. An option of this
kind actually makes two statements. If I say, “The street is wet because it
is raining,” my conclusion is “the street is wet,” and my reason is “it is
raining.” If it isn't raining, my whole statement is false. Even if it is
raining, my statement is true only if the rain is what is making the street
wet.

To decide whether to give the option a “T” or “F,” we must first
determine whether the reason given is based on an accurate statement. In
the real world, we can find out whether it is raining by looking out the
window. In an MBE option, if the reason given involves a statement about
the facts, we must return to the root to see whether the facts are accurate.
If the reason involves a statement about the law, we must search our bank
of knowledge to see whether it states the law accurately. If the reason is
based on an inaccurate statement of either facts or law, the option gets an

25

“F.”

But even if the reason given is based on an accurate statement of the
facts or law (i.e., it is actually raining), we cannot give the option a “T”
unless the reason logically justifies the conclusion. Since rain does make
the street wet, the reason given in the previous statement (i.e., it is
raining) justifies the conclusion (i.e., the street is wet), and the entire
statement is correct. If the statement is, “The street is wet because the sun
is shining,” the statement is incorrect even if the sun is shining, because
sunshine does not make the street wet.

Option (A) in the previous item says that the court should find for “the
defendant, because the defendant did not cause the piece of food to lodge
in the plaintiff's throat.” Since the reason given (i.e., the defendant did not
cause the piece of food to lodge in the plaintiff's throat) is a statement
about the facts, we must return to the root to see whether it is accurate.
According to the root, the defendant happened to be dining at a nearby
table when the plaintiff began choking on food. Since there is no fact
indicating that the defendant had anything to do with the food in the
plaintiff's throat, the reason is based on an accurate statement about the
facts. So far, option A is valid.

Next, we must decide whether the fact that the defendant did not cause

the food to lodge in the plaintiff's throat justifies the conclusion that the
court should find for the defendant. Here, of course, it is necessary to rely
on our knowledge of the law. Under the law of negligence, a defendant is
generally not under a duty to assist a plaintiff in peril unless the defendant
did something to cause that peril. Since the defendant did not cause the
food to lodge in the plaintiff's throat, the defendant had no obligation to
help remove it, and his failure to do so cannot result in liability. Since the
reason is an accurate statement, and since it logically justifies the
conclusion with which it is coupled, option A should receive a “T.”

If option A states the reason as follows: “The court should find for the

defendant because the plaintiff's brain injury resulted from a lack of
oxygen,” the option would be incorrect. The root states that the plaintiff's
brain injury was caused by a lack of oxygen, and this establishes that the
reason is based on an accurate statement of the facts. But the medical
cause of an injury does not necessarily determine whether a particular
defendant is liable. Thus, the reason given does not justify the conclusion
to which it is coupled, and the option should receive an “F.”

Option (B) is incorrect because it is a misstatement of the law. Since

26

a defendant is generally not under a duty to assist a plaintiff in peril
unless the defendant did something to cause the peril in the first place, the
defendant's liability is not measured by what any other person would
have done. Since the fact that a reasonably prudent person with the
defendant's experience, training, and knowledge would have assisted the
plaintiff would not justify the conclusion that the court should find for the
plaintiff, option (B) should receive an “F.” Option (C) references a
statute that is in effect in the jurisdiction (a common distractor in MBE
questions). Here, the question tells you that the jurisdiction has a statute
that relieves physicians of malpractice liability for emergency first aid.
Where they exist, statutes of the kind described (i.e., Good Samaritan
laws) protect a physician who renders aid, but they do not require that he
or she render aid. For this reason, the existence of such a statute would
not impose a duty on the defendant and would not be relevant to the
defendant's liability. Its existence would not make him or her liable. For
this reason, this option should receive an “F.” Option (D) also relies upon
our knowledge of the law. A defendant who performs a voluntary act with
the knowledge that it is substantially certain to result in injury intends that
injury and may be liable for causing it. Intentional tort liability cannot be
based on a failure to act, however, unless there was an obligation to act
in the first place. Because of the rule that provides that a defendant has no
duty to assist a plaintiff in peril unless the defendant caused that peril, the
defendant had no obligation to assist the plaintiff. Thus, even if he was
substantially certain that his failure to do so would result in injury, he is
not liable for the injury. The option should receive an “F.”

PRACTICE MAKES BETTER

Anyone who says that practice makes perfect is telling a tall tale; no one

and nothing can be perfect. Practice does lead to improvement, though. No
matter how good you are at answering Multistate-type questions now, the
more you practice, the better you'll get at it. If you know your law,
practicing our Multistate Method will equip you with a strategy for
achieving success on the MBE.

People who think that there is a way to get the actual MBE questions in

advance are dreaming. It's true that each MBE contains 50 questions that
have been used before. But the examiners publish only the ones that they
will not use again. So if you have a compilation of released questions, such
as Strategies & Tactics for the MBE, don't expect to see any of them on
your exam.

27

Some publishers and bar reviewers take the exam every time it is given
and tell you that their books contain verbatim copies of all the questions that
were on it. This is an empty promise. There's no such thing as a fully
photographic memory. Nobody can take a six-hour exam and come out of it
remembering even a single question word for word. MBE questions are
written so precisely that even a slight change of wording alters the effect of
the entire question.

Instead of trying to find out what the questions are going to be,

concentrate on mastering the Method so that you'll be ready for whatever
comes. The questions in this book are similar to those that the Multistate Bar
Examiners use.

Try to deal with each item by using the Method outlined in this chapter.
Start by orienting yourself to the item with a quick reading of the stem and
root, paying careful attention to the role that each assigns to you. Then apply
the basic game plan, treating each option as a separate true-false choice and
marking it with a “T,” “F,” or “?.”

The MBE is a very special game because it's a game played only by
prospective lawyers. Some will be winners, and others will be losers.
Decide in advance which you intend to be and build your whole attitude
from that basic decision. When you've learned to think of the MBE as a
game, you may even find that you look forward to playing it. Afterwards,
you may hear yourself saying that it was fun. Nevertheless, it's a game you
don't want to play more than once. So practice, practice, practice.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

1. A woman was injured when her car collided with a man's vehicle in

State A. The woman was a citizen of State B, and the man was a citizen
of State C. The woman filed her complaint in federal court in State C
based on diversity jurisdiction. Because the man was deceased, she
named the man's executor as defendant. The executor was also a citizen
of State C. Because the executor was not home at the time the woman
served her complaint, she left it with the executor's wife as allowed
under the applicable federal rule. However, both the State C rule and
the State A rule required personal service of process on executors of
estates. The executor moved for summary judgment, arguing service
was invalid because the woman failed to personally serve him with the
complaint.

The court should

(A) grant the motion, because the federal court must apply the law of

the state in which it is sitting.

(B) grant the motion, because the federal court must apply the law of

the state in which the claim arose.

(C) deny the motion, because the motion for summary judgment will

affect the woman's substantive rights.

(D) deny the motion, because the rule is arguably procedural.

2. A man sued a company in federal court for claims based on the federal
National Labor Relations Act. Thirty days after the service of the last
pleading, the man's lawyer filed and served a demand for a jury trial.
The court granted the demand, finding juries normally tried such claims
and there was no compelling reason not to do so.

Is the court's decision correct?

(A) Yes, because the court has the discretion to allow an untimely

request for a jury trial.

(B) Yes, because there is no indication the man intended to waive his

right to a jury trial.

(C) No, the right to a jury trial is waived unless demand is made within

14 days after service of the last pleading.

32

(D) No, a jury trial demand must be made in the initial complaint.

3. A musician, a citizen of State A, sued a company in federal court,

claiming the company violated his federal copyright in a song he had
written when the company used it as an advertising jingle without his
permission. The company was incorporated in State B, and all of its
executives and other decision-makers were headquartered in State C.
The musician sought $30,000 in damages. Later, the woman who co-
wrote the song, who was a citizen of State B, was allowed to join the
lawsuit. She claimed $100,000 in damages.

The company moved to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction. How should the court rule?

(A) Deny the motion, because the woman's claim can be added to the
musician's to meet the amount in controversy requirement.

(B) Deny the motion, because the musician is making a federal

copyright claim.

(C) Grant the motion, because the woman is a citizen of State B.

(D) Grant the motion, because the musician is only claiming $30,000 in

damages.

4. After a man, a citizen of State A, was injured in an automobile

accident, he sued several defendants for $100,000 in damages in state
court in State B. The man sued a truck driver, a citizen of State B, a
doctor, a citizen of State C, and a company, incorporated in State C and
had headquartered in State D. The doctor filed a notice of removal to
federal court in State B. Neither the truck driver nor the company
objected to removal.

Can the suit be removed to federal court?

(A) Yes, because neither the truck driver nor the company objected.

(B) Yes, because the case could have originally been brought in federal

court.

(C) No, because no federal question is involved.

(D) No, because the truck driver is a citizen of State B.

5. A doctor, a citizen of State A, sued a pharmaceutical company,

incorporated in State B and with its primary place of business in State

33

B, in federal court in State B. The doctor claimed $500,000 in
damages based on breach of contract and tortious interference claims,
arguing the actions of the company made it impossible for him to make
necessary contracts with medical suppliers in State C, where he also
had a practice.

In deciding the doctor's claims, what law regarding contracts and torts
should the court apply?

(A) The law of State A, because a plaintiff is the master of his or her

claim.

(B) The law of State B, because jurisdiction is based on diversity.

(C) The law of State C, because this is where the claim arose.

(D) The federal common law, because the doctor chose to sue in

federal court.

6. After being injured by faulty construction work that was done on her
home, a woman, a citizen of State A, sued a contractor, a citizen of
State B, in federal court in State B. The woman claimed $30,000 for
personal injuries, $40,000 for breach of contract, and $10,000 for
negligence. After a trial, the jury only awarded $10,000 in damages for
the woman's personal injuries, and $10,000 in damages for negligence.
The contractor then challenged the verdict, arguing the federal court
lacked jurisdiction over the claim. Did the federal court have proper
jurisdiction?

(A) Yes, because the amount in controversy was over $75,000.

(B) Yes, because the contractor waived jurisdiction by not challenging

it when the complaint was filed.

(C) No, because the woman was only awarded $20,000 total.

(D) No, because no individual claim was in excess of $75,000.

7. A freelance writer sued a magazine in federal court claiming federal
civil rights violations. The court believed the claims made in the
writer's complaint put the magazine on notice and supported a possible
claim, but not a plausible one.

Does the writer's complaint fulfill the applicable requirements of the
federal rules?

34

(B) Yes, because it supported a possible claim.

(C) No, because it did not contain detailed assertions of the facts

underlying the claim.

(D) No, because it did not support a plausible claim.

8. A man was called as a juror in a case brought in federal court against
his boss. During voir dire, he stated that he was positive he could be
fair and impartial, was planning to start a new job in a few months in a
different state, and had no strong feelings or prior knowledge regarding
the issues brought in the plaintiff's complaint.

Would it be proper for the juror to be excused?

(A) Yes, because his boss was one of the parties.

(B) Yes, because it is likely he had an actual bias in favor of his boss.

(C) No, because he was positive he could be fair and impartial.

(D) No, because he had no strong feelings or prior knowledge

regarding the issues brought in the complaint.

9. A filmmaker from State A filed suit against a producer from State B in
State B federal court. The filmmaker claimed $100,000 in damages
related to business dealings between the two men. The state rules for
service of process were identical to the federal ones. In order to serve
the summons and complaint, the filmmaker first went to the producer's
business office, but the producer was not there. Two adult employees,
members of the company's executive team working on the new video
game that was at the heart of the lawsuit, were at the office, and offered
to accept service. Just as the employees made their offer, the
producer's administrative assistant, who had just turned 18 years old
that day, returned from lunch and offered to accept service. At the same
time, the producer's wife arrived at the office and said she would take
it. The filmmaker declined the offers and went to the producer's home
to see if he was there. When he knocked on the door, the producer's
adult sister answered the door. Although she had nothing to do with the
producer's business, she told the filmmaker she had been living with
her brother for two years and would accept service of the complaint.

Who would be the most appropriate person to accept service?

35

(A) The members of the executive team, because they are company

decision makers.

(B) The sister, because she lives with the producer.

(C) The administrative assistant, because she has implied authority to

act on the producer's behalf.

(D) The wife, because she is married to the producer.

10. A woman, a citizen of State A, sued a doctor, a citizen of State B, in

federal court in State B, claiming $200,000 in damages after she had an
adverse reaction to a drug the doctor prescribed her. The doctor filed a
motion for summary judgment, arguing State B's statute of limitations
for claims such as the woman's had already expired. The woman
countered that her claim was filed well within the federal statute of
limitations.

The court should rule in favor of

(A) the woman, because statutes of limitation are arguably procedural.

(B) the woman, because the federal court applies federal common law

in determining the appropriate statute of limitations.

(C) the doctor, because statutes of limitations are substantive law.

(D) the doctor, because the federal court should apply the law of the

state in which it is sitting.

11. A company filed a diversity action in federal district court in State A
against a man for breach of contract. After a trial, the district court
found the applicable law of contracts in State A was unsettled.
However, the district court ultimately determined that the highest court
in the state would likely rule in favor of the company on that particular
issue. The man appealed, arguing the district court misinterpreted state
law. The court of appeals affirmed, stating it would defer to the district
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
court's determination of state law since it was seated in that state.

Was the court of appeals decision correct?

(A) Yes, because the challenged law is substantive.

(B) Yes, because the district court sits in State A.

(C) No, because the district court was determining unsettled state law.

(D) No, because the district court should have sent the question to the

36

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

state's highest court for a determination.

12. A man, a citizen of State A, sued a company, incorporated in State B

and with its primary headquarters in State C, in federal district court in
State A for $100,000 in damages after he was injured by one of the
company's products. The company filed a pre-answer motion to
dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction based on diversity
because it was unlikely a court would award the man more than $500.
The court denied the motion. In its subsequent answer, the company
argued the case should be dismissed because the court lacked personal
jurisdiction over it since it had never tried to make money in State A or
use any of State A's roads.

If the company is correct in its assertion, the court should

(A) dismiss the action, because the company did not purposefully avail
itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum
state.

(B) dismiss the action, because exercise of jurisdiction would not be

fair and reasonable.

(C) not dismiss the action, because the company did not raise the issue

in its first motion.

(D) not dismiss the action, because the company put a product into the

stream of commerce.

13. An independent contractor, a citizen of State A, sued a company,

incorporated in State B and with its primary place of business in State
C, in federal district court. The contractor claimed $100,000 for false
imprisonment, stating “the contractor was confined in a storage room
overnight when a company employee negligently locked the door with
the contractor still inside.” The contractor did not suffer any physical
harm caused by his time in the storage room.

The company filed a motion to dismiss. How should the court rule?

(A) Grant the motion, because the contractor failed to state a claim.

(B) Grant the motion, because it is unlikely a court would award over

$75,000 in damages in this case.

(C) Deny the motion, because the complaint puts the company on notice

of the claim being asserted.

37

(D) Deny the motion, because there is no indication that it is impossible

for recovery to be over $75,000.

14. A man owned a home in State A and lived there for 30 years. After

meeting a woman online, he decided to sell his house and move to her
home in State B for the foreseeable future to “give love a try.” Three
days later, the man was involved in an accident with a doctor who was
domiciled in State B. He sued the doctor for $100,000 in federal
district court in State B. Shortly after filing his suit, the man moved
back to State A when his relationship with the woman unexpectedly
ended after a fight. The doctor moved to dismiss for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction.

Does the district court have jurisdiction over the claim?

(A) Yes, because the man was a citizen of State A when the injury

occurred.

(B) Yes, because the man was a citizen of State A when the suit was

filed.

(C) No, because the man was a citizen of State B when the injury

occurred.

(D) No, because the man was a citizen of State B when the suit was

filed.

15. A man, a citizen of State A, bought a life insurance online from a

company based in State B. Several years later, a company based in
State C agreed to assume the obligations of the State B company and
mailed a reinsurance certificate to the man. The man accepted the new
offer and paid premiums by mail from State A to the company's office
in State C. The State C company had no other contacts with State A.
When the man died, the company refused to pay the beneficiary of the
policy because it believed the man had committed suicide, which
wasn't covered under the policy. The beneficiary sued the company in
State A pursuant to State A's long arm statute. The company argued the
State A court had no personal jurisdiction over it.

Does the State A court have personal jurisdiction over the company?

(A) Yes, because of State A's interest in protecting its residents in cases

like this.

(B) Yes, because the original policy was purchased online.

38

(C) No, because the company did not have sufficient minimum contacts

with State A.

(D) No, because any judgment would violate the company's due

process rights.

16. A truck driver from State A sued a trucking company in State A court
for violations of the state's wage and hours laws. The truck driver
claimed over $200,000 in damages. The trucking company moved to
have the case removed to federal district court. The trucking company
was incorporated in State B and all of its directors and top
management who directed the company worked in State B. However,
the company had 60 percent of its trucking fleet, its truck-driving
school, and all of its repair centers in State A.

Is removal of the claim to federal district court appropriate?

(A) Yes, because the company is incorporated in State B.

(B) Yes, because the company is directed from State B.

(C) No, because the company has done a significant amount of business

in State A.

(D) No, because the truck driver's claims are based on State A law.

17. A woman sued a company in federal court, claiming several violations

of federal patent law. During discovery, the woman's attorney
inadvertently disclosed a draft report written by one of the woman's
expert witnesses to the opposing party.

May the attorney still claim work-product protection for the draft
report?

(A) Yes, by notifying the company of the accidental disclosure.

(B) Yes, by asking the court for a protective order.

(C) No, because the attorney waived work-product protection by

disclosing the report.

(D) No, because the report was not the final report intended for trial.

18. In 2016, a woman sued a company in federal court after a remote-

controlled toy sold by the company exploded and severely injured her.
She sent a discovery request to the company asking for “all
electronically stored sales records relating to sales of the toys from

39

2006–2016.” Although the company could produce the records for
2013–2016, the remaining sales records had been deleted a month
before the woman had filed suit. The company said that under a new
cost-saving initiative, it had started routinely deleting all sales records
more than three years old to free up space on the company's computers.
However, now that the suit had been filed, it had suspended the
deletions. The woman contacted a computer expert, who said it might
be possible to recover the lost records if the company had an old
machine that had been retired from use before the routine deletions, but
that finding the records would be very expensive and might not recover
anything. The woman argued the company should pay for the necessary
experts to find the missing information.

If the company does not produce the missing information, should the
court order it to do so?

(A) Yes, because the company intentionally deleted the requested

information.

(B) Yes, because the information was potentially recoverable.

(C) No, because the deletions were done as part of the company's cost-

saving initiative.

(D) No, because it was reasonable for the company to delete sales

records that were more than three years old.

19. A man sued a doctor in federal court. The doctor decided to answer the

(C) Lack of personal jurisdiction.

(D) Lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

20. After staying in a hotel in State A, a woman, a resident of State B, sued
the hotel for breach of contract in a state court in State B. The hotel

business in State B, nor did it have any bank accounts or employees in
State B. However, the hotel did advertise on a billboard in State B and
its Internet site gave driving directions from several cities in State B,
advertised its proximity to State B, and accepted reservations and

40

credit card payments from people all over the world (including people
in State B).

Is the hotel subject to personal jurisdiction in State B?

(A) Yes, because its advertising and Internet site targeted State B

consumers.

(B) Yes, because it advertised on a billboard in State B.

(C) No, because it did not do any business in State B.

(D) No, because the injury occurred in State A.

21. A woman, a shareholder of a company, brought a class action lawsuit
on behalf of herself and all other shareholders against the company in
federal district court. The woman claimed $10,000 in damages, and
noted that there were approximately 50 shareholders of company stock.
If all 50 claims were aggregated, the amount in controversy would be
$500,000 dollars.

Would the federal district court have subject matter jurisdiction over
the claim?

(A) Yes, because it is being brought as a class action.

(B) Yes, because the aggregated amount in controversy exceeds

$75,000.

(C) No, because there is no indication all shareholders will agree to

join the action.

(D) No, because there is no indication any individual claim exceeds

$75,000.

22. In 2016, a man, a citizen of State A, sued a woman, a citizen of State B,
in federal district court in State B. The man and woman had been
married for 10 years in State A before they were granted a divorce by
a court in State A. The woman moved to State B in 2015. During the
original divorce proceedings, the woman was granted custody of the
couple's children, who were born in State A. The man now seeks
custody of the children and alimony in excess of $75,000.

Does the federal court have jurisdiction over the case?

(A) Yes, because the woman moved to State B.

41

(B) Yes, because the children were born in State A.

(C) No, because the divorce was granted by State A.

(D) No, because the man is seeking custody of the children and

alimony.

23. A student, who is a citizen of Ireland, sued a restaurant, incorporated in
State A and with all of its offices in State A, in federal district court in
State A. The student claimed $50,000 in personal injury and $50,000
for breach of contract.

Does the federal court have jurisdiction over the claim?

aggregated.

federal court's jurisdiction.

24. A man, a citizen of State A, sued a woman, a citizen of State B, for
$100,000 in personal injuries caused by an automobile accident
between the two. After a trial in federal district court, the court ruled

woman then filed suit in the same federal district court for $100,000 in
personal injuries she suffered in the same accident. Soon thereafter, the
man moved to State B, intending to stay there indefinitely.

May the woman file her claim in the federal court?

(A) Yes, because the federal court had subject matter jurisdiction over

the first action regarding the accident.

(B) Yes, because citizenship is determined at the time the suit is filed.

(C) No, because the woman's claim is barred under the compulsory

counterclaim rule.

(D) No, because the woman's claim is barred by res judicata.

25. A man sued a company in federal court claiming violations of federal
civil rights and employment laws. Ten days after service of the last
pleading directed to an important fact issue, the man filed a written
demand for a jury trial on that issue with the court and served it on the

42

company. Ten days after his demand, the man reconsidered and moved
to have his jury demand withdrawn. The company opposed the man's
motion.

How should the court rule on the man's motion?

of the last pleading directed to the issue.

(C) Deny the motion, because the man did not request withdrawal

within seven days of the jury demand.

(D) Deny the motion, because the company did not consent to the

withdrawal.

26. State A sent a certified letter to a homeowner informing him that if he
did not pay his delinquent tax bill his property would be put up for
public sale. By state law, the homeowner was required to keep his
mailing address updated, but he had failed to do so when he had moved
out of the home and into an apartment he owned in a nearby city.
Consequently, the letter was returned as “unclaimed” to the state. The
state took no further action before putting the property up for public
sale 20 days later.

After his property was sold, the homeowner sued, claiming the state
had violated his due process rights by failing to notify him of the sale.
Was the state's notification of the sale sufficient?

(A) Yes, because the state sent notification by certified mail to the

homeowner's last known address.

(B) Yes, because the state sent notification by certified mail to the

property that was subject to the delinquent tax bill.

(C) No, because the letter was returned undelivered.

(D) No, because the property was put up for sale less than 60 days after

the letter was returned.

27. After a jury trial in federal district 

court based on diversity jurisdiction, the 
court believed the jury's compensatory 
damage award met the state standard for excessiveness. Consequently,
the court offered the plaintiff the choice of either accepting a lower

43

award than that 
given by the jury or submitting to a new 
trial.

May the court do so?

(A) Yes, because the court believed the award was excessive under the

state standard.

(B) Yes, because the court could simply lower the jury's award if it

chose to do so.

(C) No, because there was no indication the jury's award was so

excessive as to “shock the conscience.”

(D) No, because forcing the plaintiff to accept a potentially lower

award 
violates the Seventh 
Amendment.

28. In what situation may a court grant a party relief from a final judgment

on the basis that the final judgment is void?

the company's CEO and other decision-making officers were based in
State A. The gas station owner claimed $20,000 in actual damages and
$1 million in punitive damages, arguing the trucking company violated
federal trucking laws by habitually using a vacant strip of land
adjoining the owner's gas station as a place to move hazardous cargo
from one truck to another as trucks passed through the state.

Does the federal district court have subject matter jurisdiction over the
owner's claim?

44

(A) Yes, because the claim involves a question of interstate commerce.

(B) Yes, because the owner's claim is based on federal law.

(C) No, because the owner is only claiming $20,000 in actual damages.

(D) No, because the trucking company is also a citizen of State A.

30. A songwriter sued a singer in federal court, claiming violation of
federal copyright laws. The songwriter notified the singer that he
planned to depose him for trial. However, on the day of the singer's
deposition, the singer failed to appear.

Was the notice of deposition sufficient to compel the singer's
appearance at the deposition?

(A) Yes, because the singer is an adverse party.

(B) Yes, because there is likely substantial need for the singer's

deposition.

(C) No, because the songwriter did not subpoena the singer.

(D) No, because the singer will likely be called to testify at trial.

31. A woman sued a man in federal district court, claiming his use of her
artwork on his blog constituted a violation of federal copyright law.
The man defended himself by arguing that his use of the artwork met
the legal definition of “fair use” under the applicable law because his
blog was educational and he was writing critically about the artwork.
The federal district court ruled in favor of the man, finding the way he
used the artwork met the legal definition of “fair use.” The woman
appealed the decision.

What standard of review will the appellate court use in making a
decision regarding whether the use of the artwork was “fair use”?

(A) De novo, because whether the use meets the legal definition of “fair

use” is a question of fact.

(B) De novo, because whether the use meets the legal definition of “fair

use” is a mixed question of law and fact.

(C) Abuse of discretion, because whether the use meets the legal

definition of “fair use” is a question of fact.

definition of “fair use” is a matter of law.

45

tax violated both the State A and Federal Constitutions. The court ruled
in favor of the county, finding the tax was lawful under both
constitutions. Several county employees in State A then brought a class
action suit against the county, challenging the same tax on the same
basis as the prior claim. The county employees received no notice of
the earlier lawsuit nor were they represented in the prior claim.

Are the employees barred from asserting their claim?

action.

34. An alternative energy company, incorporated in State A, placed 100
large wind turbines five miles off the coast of State B for the purpose
of generating electric power for the citizens of State A, B, and C. After
a hurricane, many of the turbines were destroyed. Much of the
wreckage ended up in a State B city's harbor, making the harbor
inaccessible to its large scallop and fishing fleet for several weeks.
While some of the ships were able to sail farther up the coast to

46

another harbor in State C, several tons of seafood were lost or spoiled
because the ships couldn't offload their cargo fast enough. Although
there was no way to clearly calculate the damages, city accountants
estimated that the city lost at least $1 million in port fees and fish
processing costs.

The city sued the energy company in federal court, and the company
moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Does the
federal court have jurisdiction over the city's suit?

(A) Yes, because the city's claim is substantially related to interstate

commerce.

(B) Yes, because the incident was substantially related to maritime

activity.

(C) No, because all of the company's turbines were off the coast of

State B.

(D) No, because all of the company's turbines were less than 10 miles

offshore.

35. After severe flooding in State A, the Federal Emergency Management
Association issued a check to a woman in State A to fix her home's air
conditioning and heating units. Before the woman received the check, it
was stolen from her mail carrier and cashed with the woman's forged
signature at a small check-cashing business. The check was then turned
over to a bank in State A, and the bank collected the funds owed on the
check from the Federal Reserve. Eight months later, when the United
States learned the check had been stolen, it sued the bank in federal
district court in State A to recover the amount of the check. The bank
responded that the applicable statute of limitations in State A barred
the lawsuit because the federal district court was located in State A
and there was no federal statue on point regarding the issue. The
United States argued that there was no applicable statute of limitations
under federal common law.

and the United States was barred from bringing its suit. Is the district
court's decision correct?

(B) Yes, because the federal court must follow the substantive law of

47

State A.

(C) No, because the law is arguably procedural.

(D) No, because the action involves the obligations of the United

States.

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

every piece of merchandise that had ever been produced, every single
book, and was the founding member of a group of people who dressed
up as the franchise's characters and went to sporting events, carnivals,
and other events. Finally, he named all of his children after franchise
characters and turned his car into a life-size model of one of the
franchise's spaceships. After a 20-year gap between movies, the
franchise finally released a new film. The man went to go see it and
thought it was terrible. In fact, he thought it was so terrible that it
ruined everything he had ever liked about the franchise. Consequently,
he sued the franchise's owners in federal court for damages to
compensate him for having to buy a new car, rename his children, and
sell all of his merchandise.

copyright law and State A unfair competition laws. The playwright
moved to dismiss the unfair competition claim for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction.

Does the federal district court have jurisdiction over the state claim?

(A) Yes, because success on the federal claim is a prerequisite to

success on the state claim.

(B) Yes, because both claims arose out of production of the play in

State A.

(C) No, because the federal claim does not create pendent jurisdiction

over the state claim.

(D) No, because the unfair competition claim is governed by State A

substantive law.

41. A model, a citizen of State A, sued a lawyer and an accountant in state
court in State A for injuries sustained during a fight at a baseball game.

49

The lawyer was a citizen of State A, and the accountant was a citizen
of State B. The model claimed $100,000 in damages for cuts to his
face and a broken nose that cost him several important modeling jobs.
A year after filing suit, a surveillance tape at the stadium was
discovered. It showed that the lawyer was not involved in the fight at
all, so the model dismissed his claim against him. Twenty days after
the dismissal, the accountant sought removal of the case to federal
district court in State A.

Can the accountant have the case removed to federal court?

(A) Yes, because the lawyer's dismissal was based on newly

discovered evidence.

(B) Yes, because the accountant sought removal within 30 days of the

lawyer's dismissal.

(C) No, because the accountant sought removal more than 14 days after

the lawyer's dismissal.

the state court case was commenced.

against his former employer alleging discrimination based on age and
national origin. The federal district court dismissed the complaint,
finding it failed to allege specific facts constituting a prima facie case
of employment discrimination.

(A) Yes, because the man needed to show he had a prima facie case
before the former employer would be required to answer.

(B) Yes, because the action was based on a federal question.

(C) No, because the man only needed to make a short and plain

statement of his claim.

(D) No, because there was no indication that there was no set of facts

After the repairs were done, a man, his ex-wife, and a mortgage lender
all claimed to be the true owner of the boat. The mechanic does not
want to keep the boat, and he fears that if he gives it to the wrong

50

person, the other two will sue him for damages.

action?

(A) File an interpleader action.

(B) File a declaratory judgment action.

44. A plane traveling from State A to State B crashed in State A, killing all
of the passengers. One hundred wrongful death actions against the
airline were filed in federal district court in State A. Fifty wrongful
death actions against the airline were filed against the airline in State
B. State A and State B had very different laws regarding the amount of
damages available in wrongful death actions. The airline requested a
transfer of the 50 State B actions to State A federal district court based
on convenience, noting the crash occurred in State A and the majority
of those killed in the crash were State A residents.

If the State B actions are transferred to federal court in State A, what
law will the federal court in State A apply to the State B actions?

(A) State A, because the federal district court is sitting in State A.

(B) State A, because the crash occurred in State A.

(C) State B, because the actions originated in State B.

(D) Federal common law, because there is a conflict between the laws

of State A and State B.

45. A woman, a citizen of State A, underwent surgery in State B. During
the surgery, a medical device that was being implanted in her back
snapped and damaged her spine. The woman sued the manufacturer of
the device in federal district court in State B and sued the doctor and
the hospital in State B state court. The manufacturer moved to dismiss
the woman's action for failure to join the doctor and hospital as
necessary parties under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a).

Should the federal district court dismiss the woman's case?

(A) No, because the doctor and hospital are joint tortfeasors.

51

(B) No, because the doctor and hospital are potential defendants in the

woman's action.

(C) Yes, because the doctor and hospital are necessary and

indispensable parties.

(D) Yes, because the doctor and hospital are likely jointly and

severally liable.

46. A cellphone company sued an Internet provider for patent infringement

in federal district court. The Internet provider filed a motion to
dismiss, and the district court ruled in the Internet provider's favor and
awarded attorney's fees and costs. In granting the motion, the court
found that the president and sole shareholder of the cellphone company
had acted in an inequitable way and that his inequitable conduct was
chargeable to the cellphone company. Because it was afraid it would
be unable to collect the court's award, the Internet provider moved to
amend its pleading to add the president personally under Fed. R. Civ.
P. 15 and to amend the judgment to make him immediately liable for the
award under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).

Should the court grant the Internet provider's motion?

(A) No, because the president has not had an opportunity to respond to

the claim for personal liability.

(B) No, because there is no indication that the new claim was the result

of newly discovered evidence.

(C) Yes, because the president was president and sole shareholder of

the cellphone company.

(D) Yes, because the president's actions are chargeable to the cellphone

company.

47. A man sued a carpenter for negligence in federal district court after a
ceiling repaired by the carpenter collapsed and injured the man. The
district court ruled in the carpenter's favor, finding he was not negligent
in making the repairs. The man then sued the company that employed
the carpenter in federal district court, arguing its employee was
negligent in repairing the roof.

May the man do so?

(A) No, because his claim is barred by res judicata.

52

(B) No, because his claim is barred by issue preclusion.

(C) Yes, under the doctrine of respondeat superior.

(D) Yes, because the company was not a party to the claim against the

carpenter.

48. A processor sued a retailer for violation of one of its patents. Pursuant
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), the retailer moved for judgment as a matter of
law, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the
processor's claim. The court denied the motion and sent the case to the
jury. The jury ruled in favor of the processor. The retailer appealed,
again arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim.
The processor responded that the retailer could not raise the evidence
question on appeal because it did not move for either a renewed
judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) or for a new
trial under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59.

May the court of appeals review the sufficiency of the evidence?

(A) No, because the retailer failed to move for a renewed judgment as

a matter of law or a new trial.

(B) No, because the processor received a final judgment from the jury.

(C) Yes, because questions regarding the sufficiency of the evidence

may be brought at any time.

(D) Yes, because the retailer had moved for judgment as a matter of

law before the jury's verdict.

49. Under which of the following situations is a court LEAST likely to find

proper service of process?

51. A student sued a university for racial discrimination in federal district
court. During discovery, the student asked for “all items concerning
university admission practices.” Several years earlier, a professor at
the university had written a highly critical internal memorandum
concerning the university's admission policies. After the receipt of the
memorandum, the university immediately turned it over to the
university's attorneys, who were now representing the university in the
student's action and used the memorandum in preparing the university's
defense. Due to its inflammatory nature and the amount of hearsay it
contained, the memorandum was inadmissible at trial.

Does the university have to provide the memorandum to the student?

(A) No, because it is inadmissible evidence.

(B) No, because it is privileged work product.

(C) Yes, because it could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

(D) Yes, because it would likely be impossible for the student to obtain

the information in any other way.

company, incorporated in State B and with its primary place of
business in State C, in federal district court in State C after one of the

State C. The man claimed $100,000 in damages, while the woman
claimed $30,000 in damages.

Does the federal district court have subject matter jurisdiction over the
woman's claim?

(A) Yes, because the man is claiming $100,000 in damages.

(B) Yes, the woman's claim arose from the same auto accident.

(C) No, because the company is incorporated in State B.

54

(D) No, because the woman's claim is less than $75,000.

53. An artist, a citizen of State A, sued a writer, a citizen of State B in state
court in State B for injuries sustained during a fistfight in State B. The
artist claimed $30,000 in damages. The writer filed a counterclaim for
$80,000 in damages based on the same fight.

The artist would like to remove the action to federal court based on
diversity jurisdiction. May the artist do so?

(A) No, because the writer's counterclaim is permissive.

(B) No, because the artist filed the action against the writer.

(C) Yes, because the amount in controversy is now over $75,000.

(D) Yes, because the writer's counterclaim is compulsory.

54. A man sued a company for civil rights violations. When the man's

attorney failed to comply with a discovery order, the company moved

granted the motion and also disqualified the attorney as counsel. The
attorney immediately appealed the order for sanctions. The appellate
court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

Is the appellate court's decision correct?

(A) No, because the sanctions are immediately appealable under the

collateral order doctrine.

(B) No, because the attorney was disqualified as counsel.

(C) Yes, because there has been no final decision in the case.

(D) Yes, because appellate review of the order for sanctions is

discretionary.

received during an auto accident. The court found that the engineer was
negligent and ruled in favor of the professor. A woman who was also
involved in the accident then sued the engineer in federal court in State
B. The woman sought to use issue preclusion to stop the engineer from
denying his negligence based on the State A decision. The laws of
State A would allow her to do so, but the laws of State B would not.

May the woman use issue preclusion to stop the engineer from denying
his negligence?

55

(A) No, because the federal court must follow the laws of State B.

(B) No, because the woman was not part of the first lawsuit.

(C) Yes, because the state courts of State A would allow it.

(D) Yes, because the State A decision would have res judicata effect.

56. A man, who was a citizen of State A, sued a corporation for violations
of federal copyright law in state court in State B. His claim was for an
injunction that he valued at over $100,000. The corporation, which
was incorporated in State B and had its primary place of business in
State C, filed a petition to remove the action to federal district court in
State B.

Should the action be removed to federal district court in State B?

(A) Yes, because the man is suing for violations of federal copyright

law.

(B) Yes, because there is complete diversity of citizenship.

(C) No, because the corporation is a citizen of State B.

(D) No, because the amount in controversy requirement was not met.

57. A man sued a company for violation of federal employment

discrimination laws, claiming he was unlawfully terminated from his
job. During discovery, the company asked in an interrogatory when,
where, and by whom the man was fired from his position. The
company's president answered the interrogatory, saying the company
vice president fired the man in person in the man's office on December
1. However, after filing his answer, the president learned that the man
was actually fired the day before, by the director of personnel, in the
director's office, and that the vice president only happened to speak to
the man on December 1 because he walked by when the man was
cleaning out his office.

Under the circumstances, does the company need to amend its answer?

(A) No, because the man has not filed a response challenging the

answer.

(B) No, because the company demonstrated good faith in filing its

initial response.

(C) Yes, because the company's response was not based on the

56

president's personal knowledge.

(D) Yes, because the company's response was materially incorrect.

58. A woman, a citizen of State A, was the editor of a magazine that was
incorporated and had its primary place of business in State A. A rival
magazine, incorporated in State B and with its primary place of
business in State B, wrote several editorials in its magazine making fun
of the woman. The woman sued the rival magazine for libel in federal
district court in State C because it was the only state in the nation
where the statute of limitations had not yet run out. Each magazine was
sold nationally, and each magazine sold around 10,000 copies per
month in State C.

The federal district court in State C dismissed the woman's claim,
finding State C did not have jurisdiction. Is the federal district court's
decision correct?

(A) No, because the rival magazine was marketed and sold in State C.

(B) No, because the only forum available was State C.

(C) Yes, because the woman did not have sufficient minimum contacts

with State C.

(D) Yes, because the rival magazine did not have sufficient minimum

contacts with State C.

59. A motorcyclist brought an action in federal district court in the

Northern District of State A against a company after he was injured by
one of the company's trucks. The action was filed shortly before the
statute of limitations ran out on the motorcyclist's claim. The company
moved to dismiss on the grounds that the federal court lacked personal
jurisdiction over the company and that the venue was incorrect. The
federal district court agreed with both of the company's claims.
However, because the statute of limitations on the claim has run out,
the district court believed it would be unfair to the motorcyclist to
dismiss the claim.

What can the court do in regards to the motorcyclist's claim?

(A) The court can only dismiss the case, because it lacks personal

jurisdiction.

(B) The court can only dismiss the case, because venue is incorrect.

57

(C) The court does not have to dismiss the case because it will lead to

an unfair result.

(D) The court can transfer the case to a proper venue.

60. A fireman sued a landlord for negligence in federal district court in

State A based on diversity jurisdiction. The fireman wanted to depose
one of the landlord's former tenants as a witness because he was the
only witness to some of the landlord's allegedly negligent actions.
However, the tenant, who was not a party to the lawsuit, now lived 500
miles away in State B. The fireman's attorney served a notice of
deposition at the tenant's residence, which stated that the deposition
would take place in State A and that the attorney would pay the tenant's
travel expenses. The tenant refused to travel to State A.

Can the fireman's attorney subpoena the witness to compel him to
attend the deposition in State A?

(A) No, because there is no indication the fireman's attorney is licensed

in State B.

(B) No, because the tenant now lives 500 miles away.

(C) Yes, because the tenant was the only witness.

(D) Yes, because the attorney is willing to pay the tenant's travel

expenses.

61. A bar owner sued a doctor in state court in State A for damages related

to an alleged assault and battery. Pursuant to State A law, the bar
owner applied for an attachment of $76,000 on the doctor's home in
order to protect his ability to receive a monetary judgment if he was
successful in his suit. The relevant statute authorized the attachment of
real property without notice or opportunity for a prior hearing,
although a defendant could request a hearing within 30 days after the
property was attached. To receive an attachment, the plaintiff had to
file an affidavit regarding his or her good faith belief that the claim
would be successful. The state court granted the attachment and
immediately informed the doctor.

The doctor filed suit in federal district court in State A, arguing the
attachment violated his rights under the United States Constitution.
How should the court rule?

(A) In favor of the bar owner, because the amount is over $75,000.

58

(B) In favor of the bar owner, because the doctor has 30 days in which

to request a hearing.

(C) In favor of the doctor, because he must be awarded a hearing within

14 days of the attachment of real property.

(D) In favor of the doctor, because the attachment was granted based on

the bar owner's allegations.

62. An engineer sued an oil company for injuries the engineer sustained

during an oilfield explosion. The engineer learned a truck driver who
was nearby was the only physical witness to the explosion, although a
security camera recorded a video of the explosion as well. Twenty
days after filing the complaint, the engineer served the truck driver
with a set of interrogatories asking the truck driver to describe what he
saw. The truck driver doesn't want to answer because he wasn't
supposed to be at the oilfield that day.

Is the truck driver subject to sanctions if he fails to answer the
interrogatories?

(A) Yes, because he was the only witness to the explosion.

(B) Yes, because he was served within 60 days of the suit being filed.

(C) No, because he is not a party to the action.

(D) No, because the engineer can get the same information from the

security camera.

63. A man sued a woman in federal district court in State A for injuries he
sustained from a fight. The woman moved for summary judgment and
provided evidence that she was at work in another city at the time the
fight was alleged to have occurred. In opposition to the motion, the
man submitted an affidavit giving more detailed information about the
fight with the woman. The federal district court believed that there was
very little chance the man wasn't either mistaken or lying regarding the
woman's involvement in a fight with him on the date and time the man
alleged it occurred.

Should the federal district court grant summary judgment?

(A) No, because there is still some chance the man's claim is valid.

(B) No, because the man only submitted an affidavit in opposition.

59

(C) Yes, because the court believes the man is likely mistaken or lying.

(D) Yes, because the court believes there is very little chance the man's

claim will be successful.

64. A banker went into an attorney's office seeking representation against a
bus company. The banker claimed a company bus ran over him while
he was crossing the street, causing serious injuries that led him to
being in a coma for several weeks. The banker said the lingering
effects of the coma made him unable to work. The attorney had a good
faith belief that the banker was telling him the truth, so he filed a
complaint against the company for $5 million in damages on 
the banker's behalf without getting a copy of the police report or any
other evidence. During trial, the police report regarding the bus
accident was produced. It showed that it was the banker's brother who
was hit by the bus and that he only suffered minor injuries. It was also
shown that the banker was never hospitalized and had never stopped
working. Ultimately, the company won the case, but it spent a
considerable amount of money in attorney's fees to do so.

Can the company recover the lost attorney's fees from the banker or the
banker's attorney?

(A) No, because it won the case.

(B) No, because the fees represent a valid contract between the

company and its attorney.

(C) Yes, because the attorney and the banker conspired to commit fraud.

(D) Yes, because the attorney did not make a reasonable inquiry into the

banker's claim.

65. A man sued a woman in federal court for injuries he sustained in an

auto accident. The court ordered the attorneys involved in the action to
attend a pretrial conference. Sometime later, the court ordered a
second pretrial conference. This time, the court required the man and
woman to be present. The man did not want to attend the second
conference because he did not want to see the woman any more than he
had to.

Does the man have to attend the second conference?

(A) No, because a party cannot be ordered to attend a pretrial

conference.

60

(B) No, because a court cannot order more than one pretrial

conference.

(C) Yes, because the court may require him to be available to consider

possible settlement.

(D) Yes, because the man is the plaintiff in his suit.

66. A software manufacturer sued a computer company in federal district
court in State A for breach of contract. The court's jurisdiction was
based on diversity. At the close of the computer company's case, the
computer company asked the judge to instruct the jury regarding certain
points of State A contract law. The judge failed to do so, and the
computer company's attorney failed to notice the omission. The jury
found in the software manufacturer's favor. The computer company
appealed, arguing the judge's failure to give the requested instruction
constituted reversible error. The court of appeals believed the judge
was wrong in failing to give the requested instruction.

How should the appellate court rule?

(A) Reverse the decision, because the computer company had requested

the proper instruction.

(B) Reverse the decision, because the requested instruction was based

on State A law.

(C) Affirm the decision, because the requested instruction was based

on State A law.

(D) Affirm the decision, because the computer company's attorney

failed to object.

67. A woman sued a doctor in federal district court for injuries she

sustained during a surgical procedure. Her attorney hired an 18-year-
old process server, who served the summons and complaint by leaving
it at the doctor's home with his 17-year-old son. The doctor failed to
file any response with the court.

If the woman moves for a default judgment, how should the court rule?

(A) Grant the motion, because the doctor had to respond within 21

days.

(B) Grant the motion, because the doctor had to respond within 60

days.

61

(C) Deny the motion, because the doctor's son was only 17 years old.

(D) Deny the motion, because the process server was only 18 years

old.

68. A civil rights activist filed a class action in federal district court in
State A against the State A Board of Education. The suit alleged that

students, specifically by giving more funding to schools in richer areas
than to schools in poorer areas. A woman, who was the parent of a
child who attended a school in one of the poorer areas, sought to
intervene as of right in the action as a co-plaintiff.

May the woman intervene as of right?

(A) Yes, because there is no indication the existing parties will

adequately represent her interest.

(B) Yes, because she has a child attending a school in a poorer area.

(C) No, because the action is being brought as a class action.

(D) No, because the action is being brought against a government entity.

69. A woman sued a psychiatrist for damages she claimed resulted from

two members claimed that the club systematically denied membership
perks to black members. The doctor and the lawyer each claimed
$100,000 in damages. There were 10 other black members of the club,
who likely had damages of around $10,000 each.

in damages.

(B) Yes, because a class action serves the interest of judicial economy.

ANSWERS TO 
CIVIL PROCEDURE QUESTIONS

1. D  While  federal  courts  sitting  in  diversity  apply  the  substantive  law  of
the state in which they are sitting, they apply federal procedural law if
the law is valid and on point. Importantly, under Hanna v. Plumer, 380
U.S.  460  (1965),  a  federal  court  sitting  in  diversity  will  apply  the
applicable  federal  rule  if  it  is  “arguably  procedural.”  Here,  the
conflicting rules in question cover the procedure necessary for service
of process, so the federal law is on point.

A  is  incorrect  because  while  a  federal  court  sitting  in  diversity  is
required  to  apply  the  state's  substantive  law,  it  is  not  required  to
apply the state's procedural law. Consequently, the statement in A is
too  broad.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  law  of  the  state  in  which  the
claim arose would be irrelevant in this case. C is incorrect because
although  the  motion  for  summary  judgment  itself  may  affect  the
woman's  substantive  rights,  the  issue  regarding  service  is  a
procedural one.

2. A Rule 38 states that failure to demand a jury trial within 14 days after
service  of  the  last  pleading  directed  to  the  issue  on  which  a  jury  is
sought results in a waiver of the right to a jury trial. However, Rule 39
gives  a  court  the  discretion  to  grant  a  belated  motion.  Importantly,  a
court  should  do  so  in  the  absence  of  compelling  reasons  to  the
contrary.  See  Cox  v.  Masland  &  Sons,  Inc.,  607  F.2d  138  (5th  Cir.
1979). Therefore, C is incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  although  there  is  no  indication  the  man
intended to waive his right, the decision to allow a jury trial is still
within the discretion of the court. D is incorrect because the demand
for a jury trial does not need to be made in the initial complaint.

3. B Under 28 U.S.C. §1331, federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction
over  claims  arising  under  federal  law.  Here,  since  the  musician  is
making a federal copyright claim, the jurisdiction of the federal court
is proper.

If a claim arises under federal law, there is no amount in controversy

jurisdiction  in  any  way.  Therefore,  A  and  C  are  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect because there is no amount in controversy requirement for
federal question jurisdiction, so it doesn't matter that the musician is
only claiming $30,000 in damages.

4. D  If  an  action  that  is  brought  in  state  court  could  have  originally  been
brought in federal court, it can be removed to federal court under 28
U.S.C.  §1441(a).  Only  defendants  can  remove,  and  if  there  is  more
than  one  defendant,  all  defendants  must  consent  to  the  removal.
However,  if  federal  jurisdiction  is  based  only  on  diversity,  a  case
cannot be removed to federal court if one of the defendants is a citizen
of  the  state  in  which  the  case  was  originally  brought.  Here,  although
the  man  could  have  brought  the  case  in  federal  court  based  on
diversity, the truck driver is a citizen of State B, where the state action
was  brought.  Consequently,  the  case  cannot  be  removed  to  federal
court. Therefore, A and B are incorrect.

C  is  incorrect  because  actions  with  jurisdiction  based  on  diversity
can also be removed to federal court, not simply actions based on a
federal question.

5.  B  When  exercising  jurisdiction  based  on  diversity,  a  federal  court  is
required to apply the substantive law of the state in which it is sitting.
Here, the federal court is sitting in State B.

A is incorrect because the plaintiff does not get to choose which laws
the  federal  court  will  follow  simply  because  he  or  she  brought  the
claim. C is incorrect because choice of law issues are not based upon
what state the claim arose in. D is incorrect because although there is
federal common law, federal courts cannot use federal common law
to decide state law claims.

6.  A  For  diversity  jurisdiction  to  be  proper  under  28  U.S.C.  §1332,  the
amount  in  controversy  must  be  in  excess  of  $75,000,  exclusive  of
interest  and  costs.  In  meeting  the  jurisdictional  threshold,  all  of  the
plaintiff's  claims  against  a  single  defendant  can  be  aggregated.  Here,
the woman's three claims total $80,000, so the jurisdictional amount is
met.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  federal  court's  jurisdiction  can  be
challenged at any time, not just at the time the complaint is filed. C is
incorrect  because  the  amount  in  controversy  is  determined  by  the
plaintiff's complaint, not by what is actually awarded. D is incorrect

68

because  the  woman  could  aggregate  all  of  her  claims  against  the
contractor.

7. D The federal rules generally require only that a complaint put the other
side on notice of the claim and they generally do not require detailed
assertions  of  the  facts  underlying  the  claim.  However,  under  Bell
Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal,
556  U.S.  662  (2009)  the  facts  in  the  complaint  need  to  support  a
plausible claim, not just a possible one.

Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.

8.  A  During  voir  dire,  potential  jurors  are  asked  questions  to  determine
whether  they  have  some  potential  bias  in  the  case.  If  questioning
reveals  a  juror  is  biased,  the  juror  may  be  excused  for  cause.  There
are two types of biases. An actual bias is when a juror indicates he or
she would use predetermined beliefs or principles instead of the facts
presented to determine a case. Implied bias is when it is very likely an
average  person  in  the  same  position  as  the  juror  would  be  partial  to
one of the parties. Even if the juror states he or she can still be fair and
impartial,  he  or  she  must  be  excused  from  the  case.  Here,  since  the
juror's  boss  is  one  of  the  parties,  bias  can  be  implied  and  the  juror
should be excused. Therefore, C and D are incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  facts  state  an  implied  bias,  not  an  actual
one.

9. B Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4, service is proper if the service is (i) personal,
(ii)  left  at  the  defendant's  usual  place  of  abode  with  a  person  of
suitable  age  and  discretion  who  resides  therein,  or  (iii)  served  upon
the  defendant's  authorized  agent.  Here,  since  the  sister  is  an  adult
living  with  the  producer  at  his  home,  and  there  is  no  indication  she
does not have suitable discretion, leaving the complaint with her at the
producer's home is proper.

A  and  C  are  incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  either  the
assistant or the members of the executive team are acting as agents for
the producer, whatever their job titles may be. D is incorrect because
the simple fact the producer and his wife are married would not make
service of process on the wife proper.

10. C Under Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), a federal court
in  a  diversity  case  must  apply  the  substantive  law  of  the  state  in
which it is sitting, but it follows federal procedural law. The United

69

States  Supreme  Court  has  ruled  that  statutes  of  limitations  are
substantive  law  when  determining  whether  to  apply  federal  or  state
rules.  See  Guaranty  Trust  Co.  v.  York,  326  U.S.  99  (1945).
Consequently, the federal court must follow the statute of limitations
rules of State B.

A is  incorrect  because  statutes  of  limitation  are  substantive  law  for
Erie  purposes.  B  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  rule  stating  that
federal  courts  will  follow  federal  common  law  in  determining  an
appropriate  statute  of  limitations.  D  is  incorrect  because  federal
courts  may  apply  federal  procedural  law,  so  this  statement  is  too
broad to be correct.

11.  C  When  determining  state  law,  the  federal  court  must  apply  the
substantive law that would be applied by the state's highest court. If
the  state  law  is  unsettled,  the  federal  court  may  determine  what  the
highest  court  of  the  state  would  likely  do  if  faced  with  the  issue.
Importantly,  federal  courts  of  appeal  review  the  district  courts'
decisions  as  to  unsettled  state  law  de  novo.  Therefore,  since  the
district court was determining state law, the court of appeals should
not have deferred to the district court's decision.

A is incorrect because deferral to the district court's decision would
still  be  incorrect  even  if  the  law  is  substantive.  B  is  incorrect
because  the  court  of  appeals  should  not  defer  to  the  district  court's
decision  simply  because  it  sits  in  the  same  state  the  claim  was
brought  in.  D  is  incorrect  because  although  the  federal  court  could
have abstained from hearing the state law claim or possibly certified
the issue to the state courts to obtain a ruling, it could also have made
a determination itself regarding how the state courts would rule.

12. C If a defendant files a pre-answer motion to dismiss and does not raise
personal  jurisdiction  in  that  motion,  the  defendant  waives  any
objection  to  personal  jurisdiction.  Here,  the  company  should  have
asserted this defense in its first response to the complaint.

While it is true that under Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235 (1958), a
defendant must purposefully avail himself or herself of the privilege
of  conducting  activities  within  the  forum  state,  and  that  this  can  be
shown  through  a  defendant's  attempts  to  make  money  in  the  state  or
use its roads, the issue here is that the company did not claim lack of
personal  jurisdiction  in  its  first  response.  Therefore,  C  is  the  best

70

answer and A is incorrect. While exercise of jurisdiction should be
fair  and  reasonable,  the  issue  here  is  the  company's  mistake  in  not
bringing  up  the  issue  immediately.  Therefore,  B  is  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  merely  putting  a  product  into  the  stream  of
commerce without more is not enough for personal jurisdiction.

13. A  Under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(6),  a  court  will  dismiss  a  claim  if  the
complaint  contains  an  allegation  that  negates  one  of  the  elements  of
the cause of action. False imprisonment is an intentional tort, and the
contractor's  complaint  states  he  was  locked  in  the  storage  room
through  an  employee's  negligence.  Consequently,  the  allegation  of
negligence negates the intent necessary for a successful claim of false
imprisonment, and the court should dismiss the claim.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  amount  in  controversy  requirement  for
diversity jurisdiction requires a good faith allegation of damages, not
probability of those damages being awarded. C is incorrect because
although  a  complaint  should  put  the  defendant  on  notice,  the  issue
here is that the complaint itself negates one of the elements of a false
imprisonment  claim.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  issue  here  is  the
failure  of  the  complaint  to  state  a  claim,  not  whether  the  amount  in
controversy requirement was met.

14. D Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity so
long  as  no  plaintiff  is  a  citizen  of  the  same  state  as  any  defendant.
Citizenship of the parties is determined on the date the suit is filed. If
a  person  moves  to  a  state  and  intends  to  stay  there  indefinitely,  the
person becomes a citizen of that new state. Here, at the time of filing,
the  man  had  moved  to  State  B  and  intended  to  stay  there  for  the
foreseeable  future.  Consequently,  the  man  was  a  citizen  of  State  B
when the action was filed, meaning both the doctor and the man were
citizens of the same state.

Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.

15. A Most states have long arm statutes that grant in personam jurisdiction
over nonresidents in certain situations. However, even if a state has
such a long arm statute, the constitutionality of that jurisdiction must
still be determined. In a similar scenario to the situation posed by the
question,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  ruled  in  McGee  v.
International  Insurance  Co.,  355  U.S.  220  (1957)  that  the  forum
state's strong interest in protecting its citizens from the potential bad

71

acts of insurance companies gave the forum state personal jurisdiction
over the out-of-state insurance company. Importantly, the court noted
the company renewed the insurance policy in question with the forum
state resident and continued to accept premiums from the forum state
resident. Consequently, A is the best answer choice, and C and D are
incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  the  policy  was  originally  purchased
online would not change the analysis.

16. B If an action brought in a state court could have originally been brought
in  federal  court,  a  defendant  can  have  it  removed  to  federal  court
under  28  U.S.C.  §1441.  Federal  courts  have  subject  matter
jurisdiction over claims where the plaintiff and defendant are citizens
of  different  states  and  the  amount  in  controversy  is  over  $75,000.
Here, the truck driver is claiming $200,000 in damages, so the amount
in  controversy  is  met.  Also,  the  truck  driver  is  a  citizen  of  State  A.
Consequently, federal jurisdiction will be appropriate so long as the
company is not a citizen of State A. The citizenship of a corporation
is any state where it is incorporated and the state where its principal
place  of  business  is  located.  A  corporation's  principal  place  of
business  is  the  place  where  the  corporation's  directors  and  top
management  direct  the  corporation's  business  activities.  See  Hertz
Corp.  v.  Friend,  559  U.S.  77  (2010).  While  the  company  does  a
significant  amount  of  business  in  State  A,  since  the  company  is
directed in State B, it will be deemed a citizen of State B for both its
place  of  incorporation  and  because  that's  where  the  decisions
regarding the company are made. Therefore, A and C are incorrect. D
is  incorrect  because  the  claim  can  still  be  removed  to  federal  court
even though it is based on state law.

17. A  Work  product  made  in  anticipation  of  litigation  is  privileged  and  is
not  discoverable  by  an  opposing  party  unless  that  party  makes  a
showing  of  substantial  need  and  undue  hardship  in  getting  the
materials  in  some  other  way.  Under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  26,  if  a  party
inadvertently discloses such material to the opposing party, he or she
can  notify  the  opposing  party  of  the  disclosure  and  the  basis  for
claiming work-product protection. If the disclosing party does so, the
other  party  cannot  use  the  material  until  the  court  makes  a
determination  regarding  the  validity  of  the  claim.  Therefore,  C  is
incorrect.

72

B  is  incorrect  because  the  attorney  does  not  need  to  ask  for  a
protective  order  to  claim  work-product  protection.  D  is  incorrect
because work product includes the draft reports of trial experts, and
any  final  report  intended  for  trial  is  likely  not  protected  as  work
product.

18.  C  Under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  37,  a  party  is  not  subject  to  sanctions  if  it
deletes  or  loses  electronically  stored  data  in  the  routine  and  good
faith operation of its electronic data systems. However, a party must
take  reasonable  steps  to  protect  the  data  once  it  becomes  clear  it
would be discoverable in litigation. Here, since the deletion was part
of  a  new,  routine  cost-saving  initiative,  and  there  was  no  indication
the  company  deleted  the  information  in  anticipation  of  litigation,  it
would  not  be  subject  to  any  sanctions,  such  as  paying  for  recovery
experts, for failing to produce the requested information.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  the  deletion  wasn't  a  mistake,  the
company  is  still  protected  by  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  37's  safe  harbor
provision for electronically stored data since the deletion occurred as
a  routine  part  of  maintaining  its  information  systems.  B  is  incorrect
because there is no rule stating that electronically stored data must be
absolutely unrecoverable before the safe harbor provision comes into
play.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  operative  question  is  whether  the
deletion  was  part  of  the  routine  and  good  faith  operation  of  the
information system, not whether the deletion itself was reasonable.

19. D The defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any
time,  even  on  appeal.  However,  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b),
insufficient service of process, improper venue, and lack of personal
jurisdiction  must  be  raised  at  the  time  a  party  responds  to  the
complaint  either  by  filing  a  motion  or  an  an-swer.  Therefore,  A,  B,
and C are incorrect.

20.  A  In  determining  personal  jurisdiction,  International  Shoe  Co.  v.
Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945) established that a party must have
sufficient  minimum  contacts  with  a  state  that  it  would  be  fair  and
reasonable  for  the  state  to  exercise  jurisdiction  over  that  party.  In
Snowney  v.  Harrah's  Entertainment  Inc.,  112  P.2d  28  (2006),  the
California court found that a hotel in Nevada that focused advertising
on  California  residents  through  billboards  and  its  Internet  site  was
subject to personal jurisdiction in California because it targeted and
solicited business from California residents.

73

B  is  incorrect  because  the  mere  fact  that  a  party  advertised  on  a
billboard located in a state would likely not be enough to subject it to
personal jurisdiction in that state. C is incorrect because although it
did not do any business in State B, the hotel did solicit business from
State  B  residents  by  using  a  billboard  in  State  B,  giving  driving
directions  from  State  B,  and  noting  its  proximity  to  State  B.  D  is
incorrect  because  personal  jurisdiction  is  not  based  on  where  the
injury at issue occurred.

21. D For a federal court to have subject matter jurisdiction over a claim,
the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. While aggregation of
separate  claims  is  allowed  in  the  case  of  a  single  plaintiff  suing  a
single  defendant,  aggregation  is  not  allowed  in  the  case  of  several
plaintiffs  against  one  defendant  (unless  the  plaintiffs  are  seeking  to
enforce  a  single  title  or  right  in  which  they  share  an  undivided
interest). In the case of class actions, the claims of the separate class
members  cannot  be  aggregated  if  their  claims  are  not  joint  or
common.  Here,  the  claims  all  involve  different  shares  of  company
stock,  so  the  claims  are  not  joint  or  common.  In  that  case,  the  court
would only have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim if one of
the  claims  exceeded  $75,000.  Here,  there  is  no  indication  that  one
does.

Importantly, although the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 loosened
certain  jurisdictional  requirements  for  some  class  actions,  the  Act
only applies when there are at least 100 proposed members in a class
and the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million dollars.

Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.

22.  D  Federal  courts  will  not  take  jurisdiction  over  claims  involving  the
issuance  of  a  divorce,  alimony,  or  a  child  custody  decree.  See
Akenbrandt  v.  Richards,  504  U.S.  689  (1992).  Here,  the  man  is
seeking custody of the children and alimony.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  there  is  apparently  diversity  of
citizenship, the issue is that the man is seeking custody and alimony.
B is incorrect because although the children were born in State A and
now reside in State B, this does not create any kind of special federal
jurisdiction over the claim. C is incorrect because the issue is not that
the  divorce  was  granted  by  State  A,  it's  that  the  man  is  asking  the
federal court to make a decision regarding custody and alimony.

74

23.  A  28  U.S.C.  §1332(a)(2)  grants  subject  matter  jurisdiction  over  any
dispute  between  a  citizen  of  a  U.S.  state  and  a  citizen  of  a  foreign
country. Here, the question states that the student is an Irish citizen, so
the federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over his claim.

B is incorrect because although the amount in controversy is met, the
specific issue presented by the question is that the student is a citizen
of a foreign country. If the student had been a citizen of a U.S. state
other than State A, B would have been an appropriate answer. C is
incorrect  because  all  claims  brought  by  a  single  plaintiff  against  a
single  defendant  can  be  aggregated  for  the  purpose  of  meeting  the
amount  in  controversy  requirement.  D  is  incorrect  because  subject
matter jurisdiction is not dependent upon a defendant's consent to suit.

24. C If a counterclaim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as
the  plaintiff's  claim,  it  is  a  compulsory  counterclaim  that  must  be
asserted  by  the  defendant.  Otherwise,  the  counterclaim  is  barred.
Here,  since  the  woman's  claim  arises  out  of  the  same  automobile
accident,  it  was  a  compulsory  counterclaim  that  had  to  be  raised  at
during the first action.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  the  man  sued  in  federal  court  in  the
first  action  involving  the  accident  would  not  automatically  confer
jurisdiction  to  federal  courts  for  subsequent  actions  involving  the
accident. B is incorrect because, although citizenship is determined at
the time the suit is filed, the issue here is the fact the woman should
have  brought  her  injury  claim  as  a  compulsory  counterclaim.  D  is
incorrect  because  res  judicata  applies  to  situations  where  the  same
cause  of  action  is  brought  by  the  same  plaintiff  against  the  same
defendant. Here, the woman's claim would turn her into the plaintiff
and the man into the defendant, so res judicata would not apply.

25. D Fed. R. Civ. P. 38 requires a party who desires a jury trial on a fact
issue  to  file  a  written  demand  with  the  court  and  serve  it  on  the
opposing  party  within  14  days  after  the  service  of  the  last  pleading
directed  to  that  issue.  Once  a  jury  demand  is  made,  it  cannot  be
withdrawn  unless  all  parties  consent  to  the  withdrawal.  Here,  since
the  company  opposes  withdrawal,  the  court  should  deny  the  man's
motion.

A is incorrect because the mere fact the man made the original jury
demand does not give him free reign to withdrawal it. B and  C  are

75

incorrect because the question of whether withdrawal is appropriate
is not dictated by when the withdrawal is made.

26. C In its decision in Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220 (2006), the United
States  Supreme  Court  ruled  that  the  Fourteenth  Amendment's  Due
Process Clause requires the government to take additional reasonable
steps after mailed notice of a pending action is returned undelivered.
Although  the  Federal  Rules  do  not  require  actual  notice,  a  party
cannot proceed with his or her claim if he or she knows the opposing
party  did  not  receive  notice  and  there  are  practical  alternatives  to
informing the opposing party (such as remailing the notice or posting
it on the property's door). Here, since the state took no further action
to  try  to  notify  the  homeowner  before  selling  the  property,  the  state
violated the homeowner's due process rights.

A and B are incorrect because the state took no further action to try to
notify the homeowner after the letter was returned undelivered. D is
incorrect  because  the  notice  issue  is  not  affected  by  when  the
property was actually put up for sale.

27. A When a court believes a jury award is excessive, remittitur allows a
court to offer a plaintiff the choice of a reduced award or a new trial.
If the suit is in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, the court
can  look  at  whether  the  award  meets  the  state  standard  for
excessiveness.

B  is  incorrect  because  a  court  cannot  simply  reduce  a  jury  award
without  giving  a  plaintiff  the  option  of  a  new  trial.  See  Hetzel  v.
Prince William County, 523 U.S. 208 (1998). C is incorrect because
the award does not necessarily have to “shock the conscience.” If the
federal  court  is  sitting  in  diversity,  the  court  can  look  to  the  state
standard.  D  is  incorrect  because  remittitur  does  not  violate  the
Seventh  Amendment  (however,  additur,  or  offering  a  defendant  the
choice  between  a  higher  award  or  a  new  trial  when  damages  are
inadequate, does).

28. B A judgment is void only when there was a fundamental flaw such as a
lack of jurisdiction or a party's deprivation of his or her due process
rights through failure to give notice or an opportunity to be heard. See
United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260 (2010).

While  parties  can  be  relieved  from  final  judgments  based  on  new
evidence  or  fraud,  such  situations  do  not  make  the  judgment  void.

76

Therefore, A and C are incorrect. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(a), courts
can correct clerical errors at any time, and such errors do not make a
judgment void. Therefore, D is incorrect.

29. B Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over claims based on
federal  law.  Here,  since  the  owner's  claim  is  based  on  federal
the  federal  court  would  have  subject  matter
trucking 
jurisdiction.

laws, 

A  is  incorrect  because  questions  of  interstate  commerce  do  not
necessarily involve questions of federal law. C is incorrect because
there is no amount in controversy requirement for federal claims. D is
incorrect  because  the  citizenship  of  the  parties  is  irrelevant  if  the
claim is based on federal law.

30.  A  A  notice  of  deposition  is  sufficient  to  compel  the  deposition

appearance of an adverse party.

B is incorrect because a party does not have to show substantial need
in order to depose a witness or adverse party. C is incorrect because
subpoenas  are  only  necessary  if  the  witness  to  be  deposed  is  not  a
party to the lawsuit. D is incorrect because the likelihood of a party's
testimony  at  trial  does  not  affect  whether  or  not  that  party  may  be
compelled to attend a deposition.

31. B Appellate courts review mixed questions of law and fact de novo. In
general,  whether  a  situation  meets  a  legal  standard  is  a  mixed
question of law and fact. However, you do not need to know whether
the issue presented here is a matter of law, question of fact, or mixed
question  of  law  and  fact  to  get  the  correct  answer.  Importantly,  the
other  three  answer  choices  are  incorrect  because  they  pair  an
incorrect legal question with each standard.

A is  incorrect  because  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  52(a)(6)  states  that  a  court's
findings regarding questions of fact are not disturbed unless they are
“clearly erroneous.” C is incorrect because abuse of discretion is the
standard  applied  to  a  trial  court's  decisions  regarding  discretionary
matters,  such  as  leaves  to  amend.  D  is  incorrect  because  matters  of
law are reviewed de novo.

32. C If a party receives no notice and is not represented in a prior party's
unsuccessful  litigation,  that  party  is  not  barred  from  asserting  the
same  claim  in  a  subsequent  lawsuit.  See  Richards  v.  Jefferson

77

County, 517 U.S. 793 (1996).

Res  judicata  applies  only  in  situations  where  the  first  and  second
cases  are  brought  by  the  same  plaintiff  against  the  same  defendant.
Therefore, A  is  incorrect.  Claim  preclusion  is  another  term  for  res
judicata. Therefore, B is incorrect. D is incorrect because under the
circumstances  the  fact  the  second  claim  is  being  brought  as  a  class
action has no bearing on whether the second claim is barred.

33. C A party can request a temporary restraining order when an injury will
occur before the grant of a preliminary injunction. Consequently, the
correct  order  for  such  actions  is  temporary  restraining  order  first,
preliminary  injunction  second.  In  addition,  a  preliminary  injunction
cannot be issued without notice to the adverse party.

To  receive  an  ex  parte  temporary  restraining  order,  a  party  must
provide  security  in  case  the  adverse  party  is  wrongfully  restrained,
certify  efforts  to  notify  the  adverse  party,  and  state  specific  facts
showing  the  party  will  suffer  immediate  and  irreparable  injury.
Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

34.  B  If  an  action  involves  a  “potentially  disruptive  effect  on  maritime
commerce” and the activity giving rise to the action has a “substantial
relationship  to  traditional  maritime  activity,”  federal  courts  have
original  jurisdiction  over  the  action  because  of  its  maritime  nexus.
See Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513
U.S. 527 (1995). Here, the turbine wreckage has shut down the harbor
for  several  weeks,  and  made  it  inaccessible  to  the  fishing  fleet.
Consequently, it appears to have the necessary connection to maritime
activity, making B the best answer.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  mere  fact  an  action  involves  interstate
commerce  is  not  enough  to  give  a  federal  court  subject  matter
jurisdiction.  C  is  incorrect  because  this  action  can  be  brought  into
federal  court  based  on  its  relationship  to  maritime  activity,  making
the  citizenship  of  the  opposing  parties  irrelevant.  D  is  incorrect
because  there  is  no  minimum  offshore  mileage  requirement  for  an
action to arise under maritime law.

35. D Under the rule provided in Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318
U.S.  360  (1943),  the  federal  courts  are  allowed  to  make  federal
common law when the rights and obligations of the United States are
at issue. Here, since the action is based on the federal government's

78

obligations  to  pay  on  its  check,  the  federal  court  would  use  federal
common law to make its determination. Therefore, B is incorrect.

Although Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938)  found  that
federal courts cannot make federal common law when ruling on state
law claims, federal courts are allowed to make federal common law
when  dealing  with  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  United  States.
Therefore, A is incorrect. C is incorrect because the deciding issue
here is not whether the rule is substantive or procedural, but that the
rights  and  obligations  of  the  United  States  are  being  determined  by
the court.

36. A  Under  28  U.S.C.  §1391,  venue  is  proper  in  (a)  the  judicial  district
where any defendant resides, so long as all defendants are residents
of  the  state  in  which  the  district  is  located;  (b)  a  judicial  district
where  a  substantial  part  of  the  events  giving  rise  to  the  claim
occurred; or, (c) if no district in the United States satisfies either (a)
or (b), a judicial district where any defendant is subject to the court's
personal jurisdiction in regards to such action. Here, since not all the
defendants are citizens of the same state, the only appropriate venue
would be the Eastern District of State B, where the accident occurred.

Therefore, B, C, and D are incorrect.

37. C  Under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(e),  if  a  party  finds  that  a  complaint  is  so
vague  or  ambiguous  that  the  party  cannot  reasonably  frame  a
response, the party may move for a more definite statement. However,
such  a  motion  must  be  made  before  the  party  responds  by  filing  an
answer or other reply.

A  is  incorrect  because  lack  of  subject  matter  jurisdiction  can  be
raised  at  any  time,  even  on  appeal.  B  and  D  are  incorrect  because
they  can  be  raised  at  the  time  the  party  files  a  motion  or  his  or  her
answer.

38. D  If  a  Rule  12  motion  is  not  made,  a  defendant  who  was  mailed  the
complaint  and  who  waived  formal  service  must  answer  within  60
days after the request for waiver was mailed. If a defendant is served
formally  with  a  summons  and  complaint,  he  or  she  must  answer
within 21 days after service. If the court grants a motion for a more
definite statement, the answer is due within 14 days. Therefore, A, B,
and C are incorrect.

79

39. D Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b), a defendant can make a motion to dismiss
for  failure  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief  can  be  granted.  This
means  that  even  if  all  of  the  plaintiff's  allegations  are  true,  there  is
still  no  claim  for  which  the  court  can  grant  relief.  Here,  even  if  the
man is correct that the movie is so terrible that it ruins the franchise
for him, this would not entitle him to any type of judicial relief. If the
franchise  owners  are  granted  this  motion,  they  will  not  need  to  file
any type of answer to the complaint.

A is incorrect because the issue here is not that the complaint is too
vague,  the  issue  is  that  hating  a  terrible  movie  does  not  create  any
kind of legal action for the viewer. B is incorrect because a motion
for  summary  judgment  requires  the  court  to  look  at  all  the  evidence
presented  by  the  parties.  Here,  the  matter  can  be  deposed  of  much
more quickly with a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. C
is incorrect because declaratory judgments are used to determine the
rights and status of the parties involved in a case, and such a ruling
does  not  require  that  any  action  be  taken.  Here,  the  issue  is  that  the
man is suing because he hates a movie, which is not something he can
be  granted  relief  for,  so  the  court  should  just  dismiss  his  claim
without requiring the parties to do anything else.

40. B If jurisdiction is based on a question of federal law, the federal court
will  also  have  jurisdiction  over  state  law  claims  arising  from  the
same case or controversy. See Hurn v. Oursler, 289 U.S. 238 (1933).
Here,  both  the  federal  and  state  claims  arise  from  the  playwright
putting on the play in State A.

A  is  incorrect  because  it  is  unclear  whether  the  federal  claim  is
actually  a  prerequisite  to  the  state  claim.  In  any  event,  it  would  not
matter since both claims arise out of the same case or controversy. C
is  incorrect  because,  as  stated  above,  the  federal  court  would  have
supplemental or pendent jurisdiction over the state law claim because
it is part of the same controversy as the federal claim. D is incorrect
because  the  mere  fact  a  claim  might  be  governed  by  state  law  does
not remove that claim from potential federal jurisdiction.

41. D  Under  28  U.S.C.  §1446(b),  an  action  cannot  be  removed  to  federal
court  based  on  diversity  more  than  one  year  after  the  action  was
commenced  in  state  court.  Here,  the  claim  became  removable  when
the  model  dismissed  his  claim  against  the  lawyer  because  the
opposing parties are now citizens of different states. However, a year

80

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

has already passed since the beginning of the action in state court, so
it cannot now be removed.

A  case  must  be  removed  no  later  than  30  days  after  the  defendant
discovers the case is removable. However, because of the one-year
rule, A, B, and C are incorrect.

42. C Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9, a complaint only needs to provide a short and
plain  statement  of  the  claim.  The  Federal  Rules  only  require
heightened and more specific pleading when the claim involves fraud,
mistake,  or  special  damages.  Here, 
the  man's  employment
discrimination claim would not need to meet the heightened pleading
requirements,  and  the  federal  courts  cannot  require  more  specific
pleading  outside  the  narrow  group  of  situations  provided  for  in  the
Rules.  See  Swierkiewicz  v.  Sorema  N.A.,  534  U.S.  506  (2002).
Therefore, A is incorrect.

B is incorrect because not all federal questions require more specific
pleading.  D  is  incorrect  because  this  answer  choice  refers  to  the
standard required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) for a motion to dismiss
for failure to state a claim.

43. A  Under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  22  and  28  U.S.C.  §1335, a  person  who  is  in
possession of property claimed by more than one party (known as a
“stakeholder”) can file an interpleader action to require the property
claimants  to  litigate  amongst  themselves  to  determine  who  owns  the
property. In this way, the stakeholder can avoid liability.

B  is  incorrect  because  a  declaratory  judgment  is  generally  used  to
determine the rights, duties, or obligations of parties without ordering
any  action  or  awarding  damages. C  is  incorrect  because  impleader
refers to the ability of a party to bring a non-party into the action if
that  non-party  may  be  liable  for  any  part  of  the  judgment.  D  is
incorrect  because  intervention  of  right  refers  to  when  a  non-party
claims  an  interest  in  the  subject  matter  of  an  action  and  demands  to
join the action.

44. C Under 28 U.S.C. §1404, for the convenience of parties or witnesses,
the  federal  district  court  may  transfer  a  civil  action  to  any  other
district  or  division  where  the  action  might  have  been  brought  or  to
any district or division to which all of the parties have consented. If a
transfer is made purely on the grounds of convenience, the transferee
court will apply the law that would have been applied in the original

81

court. See Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612 (1964). Consequently,
the State A court will apply the law of State B.

Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

45.  A  Joint  tortfeasors  with  potential  joint-and-several  liability  are
permissive parties to an action. Consequently, they are not “necessary
and indispensable” parties subject to compulsory joinder under Fed.
R.  Civ.  P.  19.  See  Temple  v.  Synthes  Corp.,  498  U.S.  5  (1990).
Therefore,  the  federal  case  should  not  be  dismissed  simply  because
the woman failed to join the doctor and the hospital.

B is incorrect because the mere fact that the doctor and hospital are
potential defendants does not make them subject to Fed. R. Civ. P. 19.
C is incorrect because the United States Supreme Court has held that
joint  tortfeasors  are  not  necessary  and  indispensable  parties.  D  is
incorrect  because  the  fact  the  doctor  and  hospital  are  likely  jointly
and  severally  liable  does  not  make  them  parties  necessary  for  the
federal adjudication.

46. A A pleading cannot be amended if the amendment violates a party's due
process  rights.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  ruled  that
amending a pleading and simultaneously making the new party liable
violates due process because the new party does not have a chance to
respond before the entry of judgment against him or her. See Nelson v.
Adams USA, Inc., 529 U.S. 460 (2000).

B is incorrect because a pleading can be amended for other reasons
besides  the  discovery  of  new  evidence.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
mere fact that the president was president and sole shareholder of the
cellphone  company  would  not  automatically  make  him  personally
liable  for  the  cellphone  company's  liability.  D  is  incorrect  because
although  his  actions  are  chargeable  to  the  cellphone  company,  this
does  not  mean  he  had  a  chance  to  contest  his  potential  personal
liability.

47. B Issue preclusion (also known as collateral estoppel) bars a party from
re-litigating  issues  that  were  actually  litigated  and  necessary  for  the
judgment in the first action. Here, since the man was unsuccessful in
his negligence claim against the carpenter, who was primarily liable
for  his  alleged  negligence,  he  cannot  now  re-litigate  the  same  claim
against  the  company,  who  was  secondarily  liable  for  the  alleged
negligence.

82

A  is  incorrect  because  res  judicata  usually  applies  to  a  situation
where  the  same  claimant  is  suing  the  same  defendant  for  the  same
cause  of  action.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  doctrine  of  respondeat
superior  does  not  address  the  fact  that  the  issue  of  the  carpenter's
negligence was already litigated. D is incorrect because even though
the man did not sue the company in the prior action, this fact does not
mean the man can now sue the company.

48. A A motion for judgment as a matter of law is made before the case is
submitted  to  a  jury  and  asks  the  court  for  judgment  in  the  moving
party's favor based on the argument that no reasonable person could
come to a different conclusion. A renewed motion for judgment as a
matter of law comes after entry of judgment and can only be made if
the  moving  party  made  a  motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law
during the trial. A motion for a new trial is made after judgment and
may be granted because of trial error, juror misconduct, or problems
with the verdict.

The United States Supreme Court has ruled that if a party wishes to
raise the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, the party
making  the  appeal  must  have  already  moved  for  either  a  renewed
judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  or  a  new  trial.  See  Unitherm  Food
Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U.S. 394 (2006). Therefore,
B, C, and D are incorrect.

49. A  Under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  4,  service  is  proper  if  (a)  a  party  is  served
personally, (b) service is left at the defendant's usual place of abode
with  a  person  of  suitable  age  and  discretion  who  resides  within,  or
(c) service is made upon the defendant's authorized agent. Service can
be made by any person who is at least 18 years old and is not a party
to  the  action.  Consequently,  the  plaintiff  could  not  personally  serve
the defendant.

B is incorrect because service may be made by a U.S. Marshal at a
party's request and it is likely an executive officer of the company is
an  authorized  agent  of  the  company.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
process server is at least 18 years old, and the defendant's daughter
likely  resides  at  the  defendant's  home.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
process  server  is  over  18  years  of  age  and  the  18-year-old  renter
resides in the defendant's home.

50. D  Oral  depositions  are  governed  by  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  30.  They  can  be

83

taken over the telephone or by other electronic means.

A is incorrect because leave of the court or stipulation of the parties
is required to depose the same person more than once. B is incorrect
because a deposition cannot be longer than “one day of seven hours”
without leave of the court or stipulation of the parties. C is incorrect
because a party cannot take more than 10 depositions without leave
of the court or stipulation of the parties.

51. C  Under  the  discovery  rules  in  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  26(b)(1),  a  party  must
provide “any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim
or  defense.”  Additionally,  information  “need  not  be  admissible  in
evidence”  if  it  is  likely  to  lead  to  the  discovery  of  admissible
evidence.  Consequently, 
the
memorandum to the student. Therefore, A is incorrect.

should  provide 

the  university 

B is incorrect because work product is material made in anticipation
of  litigation.  Here,  the  memorandum  was  written  several  years
earlier. D  is  incorrect  because  it  is  not  necessary  for  the  student  to
show it is impossible for him to obtain the information in any other
way.

52.  C  Although  claims  that  fail  to  meet  the  amount  in  controversy
requirement  of  $75,000  can  be  heard  based  on  supplemental
jurisdiction if they arise from a common nucleus of fact, supplemental
jurisdiction does not override the rules regarding complete diversity
of  citizenship.  Here,  the  woman  is  a  citizen  of  State  B,  and  the
company  is  incorporated  in  State  B,  so  the  court  would  not  have
subject  matter  jurisdiction  over  the  claim  because  both  the  woman
and  the  company  are  citizens  of  the  same  state.  Importantly,  a
corporation  is  a  citizen  of  both  the  state  in  which  it  is  incorporated
and its primary place of business.

Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

53. B Only defendants may remove an action to federal court. Here, since
the  artist  brought  the  action,  he  is  the  plaintiff  and  cannot  request
removal.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  writer's  counterclaim  is  a  compulsory
counterclaim since it arises from the same transaction or occurrence.
C is incorrect because the fact the plaintiff is now facing a claim for
over  $75,000  would  not  allow  the  plaintiff  to  remove  the  case  to

84

federal  court.  Additionally,  the  fact  the  defendant's  counterclaim  is
compulsory  would  not  allow  the  plaintiff  to  remove  an  action  to
federal court. Therefore, D is incorrect.

54. C Except for certain interlocutory orders such as injunctions, only final
decisions  are  reviewable  by  an  appellate  court.  In  Cunningham  v.
Hamilton  County,  527  U.S.  198  (1999),  the  United  States  Supreme
Court found that an order imposing sanctions on an attorney was not a
final decision regarding the case despite the fact the attorney was no
longer involved in the litigation. Therefore, B is incorrect.

A is incorrect because the collateral order doctrine refers to a narrow
exception  to  the  final  decision  rule  that  allows  parties  to  appeal
certain interlocutory rulings without waiting for a final decision. D is
incorrect  because  there  has  not  been  a  final  decision  in  the  case.
Consequently,  the  appellate  court's  inability  to  hear  the  appeal  was
not simply discretionary.

55.  C  Under  28  U.S.C.  §1738,  a  federal  court  must  give  state  court
judgments  the  same  effect  as  the  state  itself  would  give  to  the
judgment. In regards to issue preclusion, this rule applies in all but a
few  narrow  situations  delineated  by  Congress.  Here,  since  State  A
would  allow  the  judgment  to  be  used  this  way,  the  federal  district
court in State B must do so as well.

A is incorrect because this question does not focus on what law the
federal court should apply, but on what effect the State A state court
judgment  should  have  in  the  woman's  litigation.  B  is  incorrect
because issue preclusion does not require the woman to be a party to
the  first  lawsuit.  D  is  incorrect  because  res  judicata  and  issue
preclusion are two different legal concepts, and this answer choice is
simply lumping them together.

56. A  If  a  plaintiff  raises  a  federal  question,  a  defendant  may  remove  the
action to federal court even if that defendant is a citizen of the state in
which the claim was originally brought. This differs from the rule for
an  action  that  may  be  removed  to  federal  court  based  on  diversity
jurisdiction.  In  that  case,  if  the  defendant  is  a  citizen  of  the  state
where the action was brought, he or she cannot remove the action to
federal  court.  Here,  because  the  man's  claim  raised  a  federal
question, any issue regarding the removal's appropriateness based on
diversity  jurisdiction  is  irrelevant.  Therefore,  B,  C,  and  D  are

85

incorrect.

57. D Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1), if a party learns that a response to an
interrogatory was materially incomplete or incorrect, that party must
supplement  or  correct  the  response.  Here,  the  response  was
materially incorrect regarding the time, place, and person who fired
the man from his position.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  responding  party's  duty  to  correct  the
response  is  not  dependent  upon  the  other  party  challenging  the
answer. B  is  incorrect  because  even  though  the  company  seemed  to
have answered the question in good faith, this would not relieve it of
the duty to amend the response once it discovered it was incorrect. C
is  incorrect  because  whether  the  response  was  based  on  the
president's personal knowledge is immaterial to the question.

58.  A  In  Keeton  v.  Hustler  Magazine,  465  U.S.  770  (1984),  the  United
States Supreme Court ruled that a state had personal jurisdiction over
a  defendant  magazine  for  a  libel  suit  because  the  magazine  sold
10,000  copies  per  month  in  that  state.  This  was  true  even  though
neither the plaintiff nor the defendant were citizens of the forum state
or  had  any  other  contacts  with  the  forum  state.  Importantly,  by
exploiting  the  state's  market,  the  Court  found  the  magazine  should
have  reasonably  anticipated  “being  haled  into  court  there  in  a  libel
action  based  on  the  contents  of  its  magazine.”  Therefore,  D  is
incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  mere  fact  State  C  was  the  only  state  in
which  the  statute  of  limitations  had  not  yet  run  out  would  not  give
State C jurisdiction over the claim. C is incorrect because the fact the
woman  did  not  have  much  contact  with  the  state  would  not  affect
whether the state had personal jurisdiction over the rival magazine.

59. D Under 28 U.S.C. §1406(a), if a case is filed in an improper venue, the
court  may  transfer  the  case  to  any  district  or  division  it  could  have
been brought in “if it be in the interest of justice.” Consequently, if the
court  believes  dismissing 
the
motorcyclist, it can transfer the case to the proper district.

the  case  would  be  unfair 

to 

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  this  rule  applies  even  though  the
federal  district  court  does  not  have  proper  jurisdiction  over  the
claim.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  dismissal  would  lead  to  an
unfair result does not give the federal district court jurisdiction.

86

60. B  A  subpoena  for  a  deposition  may  command  a  witness  who  is  not  a
party to the lawsuit to attend a deposition that is “within 100 miles of
where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business
in person.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c). Here, since the tenant lives 500
miles away, he cannot be compelled to attend.

The  issue  here  is  that  the  attorney  can  depose  the  tenant,  she  just
needs  to  travel  to  State  B  to  do  it.  A  is  incorrect  because  the
fireman's attorney can subpoena the witness to attend a deposition in
State B even if she is not licensed in State B. C is incorrect because
if  she  wants  the  deposition,  she  can  travel  to  State  B  to  get  it.  D  is
incorrect because it doesn't matter that the attorney is willing to pay
the costs of the tenant's travel.

61. D In Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1(1991), the United States Supreme
Court found that a statute allowing prejudgment attachment without a
showing  of  extraordinary  circumstances  violated  the  Due  Process
Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  In  determining  the  process
necessary before a state can deprive a person of his or her property
through  a  prejudgment  attachment,  courts  should  look  at  (1)  the
interest  that  will  be  affected,  (2)  the  risk  of  erroneous  deprivation,
and (3) the interest of the party seeking the prejudgment remedy. Here,
the  State  A  statute  allows  attachment  based  only  on  an  affidavit
provided  by  the  requesting  party,  which  creates  a  high  risk  of
erroneous deprivation.

A is incorrect because amount in controversy is an issue for subject
matter jurisdiction, which is not an issue created by this question. B
and C are incorrect because the Due Process issue in this case would
not be solved by a hearing after the attachment.

62. C Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a), only parties to an action are required to
respond  to  interrogatories.  Non-party  witnesses  are  subject  to  being
deposed. Consequently, the truck driver does not need to answer the
interrogatories.

Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

63. A  Under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(a),  summary  judgment  is  appropriate  only
when  “there  is  no  genuine  dispute  as  to  any  material  fact  and  the
movant  is  entitled  to  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law.”  Here,  since  the
court  believes  that  there  is  still  some  chance  that  the  man's  claim
might  be  valid,  it  would  be  inappropriate  for  the  court  to  grant

87

summary judgment.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  issue  here  isn't  the  sufficiency  of  the
evidence; it is whether there is no genuine dispute as to any material
fact. C is incorrect because the standard for summary judgment is not
focused  on  whether  the  non-moving  party  is  mistaken  or  lying.  D  is
incorrect  because  summary  judgment  is  only  appropriate  when  the
court believes that as a matter of law all issues should be decided in
the movant's favor.

64. D Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, when an attorney files a pleading, motion, or
other paper with the court, that attorney certifies that “after an inquiry
reasonable  under  the  circumstances  .  .  .  the  factual  contentions  have
evidentiary  support.”  If  an  attorney  violates  this  rule,  he  or  she  is
subject  to  sanctions.  Here,  since  the  attorney  did  not  do  any
investigation into the factual contentions regarding the banker's claim
(such  as  getting  the  police  report),  it  is  likely  the  company  could
move  for  Rule  11  sanctions  and  receive  a  court  order  requiring  the
attorney and/or the banker to pay the lost attorney's fees.

A is  incorrect  because  even  though  the  company  won  the  case,  this
does not fix the harm caused by the lost attorney's fees. B is incorrect
because  the  fee  agreement  between  the  company  and  its  attorney  is
not  at  issue.  C  is  incorrect  because  there  was  no  indication  the
banker's  attorney  was  acting  in  bad  faith,  so  they  did  not  conspire
together to commit fraud.

65. C Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16, a court may order the attorneys to appear for
one  or  more  pretrial  conferences  for  several  reasons,  such  as
expediting  the  action,  discouraging  wasteful  pretrial  activities,  and
facilitating settlement. Importantly, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c)(1), “if
appropriate, the court may require that a party or its representative be
present or reasonably available by other means to consider possible
settlement.” In fact, if the man fails to attend, he could be subject to
sanctions. Therefore, A and B are incorrect.

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

D is incorrect because the fact the man is the plaintiff does not change
the analysis.

66.  D  If  a  party  believes  that  the  court  has  failed  to  give  a  proper  jury
instruction, Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d) states that a party may assign error
to  “failure  to  give  an  instruction,  if  that  party  properly  requested  it
and—unless the court rejected the request in a definitive ruling on the

88

the  computer
record—also  properly  objected.”  Here,  since 
company's attorney did not object, the computer company waived its
right to the instruction.

Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.

67.  A  If  a  party  has  “failed  to  plead  or  otherwise  defend,”  the  opposing
party  can  move  for  a  default  judgment  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  55(a).
Generally,  a  defendant  must  serve  an  answer  “within  21  days  after
being  served  with  the  summons  and  complaint.” See  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.
12.

B is incorrect because a defendant has 60 days to respond if he or she
has waived service. Here, since there is no indication that the doctor
waived service, he would have had 21 days to respond. This makes
A the stronger answer. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4, service is proper if
(a) a party is served personally, (b) service is left at the defendant's
usual  place  of  abode  with  a  person  of  suitable  age  and  discretion
who  resides  within,  or  (c)  service  is  made  upon  the  defendant's
authorized  agent.  There  is  no  strict  age  requirement  regarding  who
service  can  be  left  with,  so  the  17-year-old  son  was  probably
appropriate. Therefore, C  is  incorrect.  Service  can  be  made  by  any
person who is at least 18 years old and is not a party to the action.
Therefore, D is incorrect.

68. A Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24, “the court must permit anyone to intervene
who . . . claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that
is  the  subject  of  the  action,  and  is  so  situated  that  disposing  of  the
action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability
to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that
interest.” As the mother of a student in a poor-area school, the woman
clearly  has  an  interest  in  the  action  and  could  lose  her  ability  to
protect  that  interest  if  the  civil  rights  activist  loses  the  case.  The
important point here is that there is no indication the existing parties
will adequately represent her interests.

B  is  incorrect  because  if  the  court  found  that  the  existing  parties
would  adequately  protect  the  woman's  interest,  she  would  not  be
allowed to intervene as of right. C and D  are  incorrect  because  the
underlying nature of the action is irrelevant.

69. D “A party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the
other parties . . . any insurance agreement under which an insurance

89

business may be liable to satisfy all or part of a possible judgment.”
See  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  26(a)(1)(A). Consequently,  the  attorney  does  not
have to do anything to get the information she wants.

Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.

70.  C  For  a  class  action  to  be  brought,  the  class  must  meet  four
requirements. First, the class must be so numerous that joinder of all
its  members  is  impracticable.  Second,  there  must  be  a  common
question of law or fact. Third, the representatives must have a claim
or  defense  typical  to  the  other  members  of  the  class.  Fourth,  the
representatives must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the
class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Here, since there are only 12 potential
class members, it is unlikely a court would find the class so numerous
that joinder is impracticable. Therefore, A and B are incorrect.

D is incorrect because it is not necessary in a class action that each of
the  unnamed  members  of  the  class  claim  over  a  certain  amount  in
damages.

71.  B  Collateral  estoppel  (also  known  as  issue  preclusion)  refers  to  the
situation where a particular issue of fact or law has been determined
in a prior proceeding, and a party seeks to use that determination in a
subsequent  proceeding.  In  that  case,  courts  state  that  a  party  is
collaterally  estopped  from  re-litigating  the  issue.  In  Parklane
Hosiery  Co.  v.  Shore,  439  U.S.  322  (1979),  the  United  States
Supreme  Court  ruled  that  in  a  similar  situation  a  party  could  use
collateral  estoppel  offensively  against  another  party  when  it  was
unlikely that the party seeking estoppel could have intervened in the
first  action.  Here,  since  it  was  unlikely  the  shareholder  could  have
intervened  in  an  action  brought  by  the  SEC,  he  can  use  collateral
estoppel  to  prevent  re-litigation  of  the  issue  in  his  suit  against  the
company.

A is incorrect because its not enough that the issue was decided in the
prior action—there must be some indication that the party seeking to
use  collateral  estoppel  in  this  way  would  not  have  been  able  to
intervene  in  the  prior  lawsuit.  C  is  incorrect  because  such  use  of
collateral  estoppel  does  not  violate  a  party's  Seventh  Amendment
right to a jury trial even if the prior action involves equitable claims.
D is incorrect because the shareholder can use the prior ruling even if
he was not a party to the SEC action.

90

72.  A  The  Seventh  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  gives  a
right to a jury for suits “at common law.” Consequently, with only a
few exceptions, there is only a right to a jury trial for claims that are
“legal”  (those  claims  that  involve  a  claim  for  damages).  There  is
generally  no  right  to  a  jury  trial  for  claims  that  are  “equitable”
(claims that involve an injunction). Here, since the singer is seeking
an injunction, he is not entitled to a trial by jury.

Therefore, B, C, and D are incorrect.

73. A Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 48, “a jury must begin with at least six and no
more  than  12  members.”  In  addition,  “unless  the  parties  stipulate
otherwise, the verdict must be unanimous and must be returned by a
jury of at least six members.” Since there is no indication the parties
stipulated otherwise, the jury's verdict has to be unanimous before it
can be entered in the man's favor. Therefore, C and D are incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because,  as  stated  above,  a  jury  can  have  between  6
and 12 members.

74. C A crossclaim is when a party makes a claim against a co-plaintiff or
co-defendant. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g), a crossclaim must be part
of  the  same  transaction  or  occurrence.  However,  a  crossclaim  is
always  optional.  Consequently,  the  store  can  file  its  own  claim
against the delivery service.

A and B are incorrect because the crossclaim is still optional even if
it is fully litigated in the other action and even if it arises out of the
same transaction or occurrence. D is incorrect because the citizenship
of the parties does not change the analysis regarding the crossclaim.

75. A In International Shoe v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), the United
States  Supreme  Court  ruled  that  an  out-of-state  company  had
sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state when that company
purposely availed itself of the chance to do business there, and should
have  anticipated  being  required  to  litigate  claims  in  the  forum  state.
Here,  by  having  a  salesman  in  the  state,  the  supplier  purposefully
availed  itself  of  the  chance  to  do  business  there  and  should  have
anticipated the possibility of litigation.

Therefore, B, C, and D are incorrect.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

1. A state enacts the Continuing Professional Education Act, which
provides that all persons licensed by the state to practice any
profession other than medicine are required to complete 10 units per
year of state-approved continuing education studies as a condition for
renewal of their professional licenses.

The day after the statute goes into effect, a law school graduate, who
has applied for but not yet received a license to practice law, sues in
federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Continuing
Professional Education Act is unconstitutional. Which of the following
is the clearest ground for dismissal of this action by the court?

(A) No substantial federal question is presented.

(B) The suit presents a non-justiciable political controversy.

(C) The student lacks standing to attack the statute.

(D) The validity of the statute has not yet been determined by a state

court.

2. A state law declares a wild pig to be an endangered species and

prohibits the killing or shooting of any wild pig within the state. A new
national park was established by the federal government to preserve

95

plants and animals native to the region, and is located entirely within
the state. The wild pig is so hardy that it has begun to displace other
wildlife in the national park. Because the wild pig is actually
descended from European stock, the United States Department of the
Interior has contracted with an exterminator, a resident of another state,
to kill all wild pigs living within the national park. The contract with
the exterminator is specifically authorized by federal statutes regulating
the operation of national parks.

If the exterminator is prosecuted by the state for violating the law that
prohibits the killing of wild pigs, which of the following is the
exterminator's strongest argument in defense against that prosecution?

(A) Only the federal government can declare a species to be

endangered.

(B) As applied, the state statute unduly interferes with interstate

commerce.

(C) As applied, the state statute violates the Obligation of Contracts

Clause of the United States Constitution.

(D) As applied, the state statute violates the Supremacy Clause of the

United States Constitution.

3. A state statute prohibits the killing of any animal “in a manner which

causes unnecessary pain or suffering of said animal.” The defendant is
prosecuted for violating the statute by strangling a chicken as part of a
religious ritual in which he participated. The defendant defends on the
ground that the state statute as applied in his case unconstitutionally
interferes with his free exercise of religion.

Which of the following may the court NOT consider in determining
the constitutionality of the statute?

(A) Whether the statute is necessary to protect a compelling state

interest.

(B) Whether the religious belief that requires the strangling of a chicken

is reasonable.

(C) Whether the religious ritual involving the strangling of chickens has

been practiced for a long period of time.

(D) Whether the defendant is sincere in the religious belief that requires

96

the strangling of a chicken.

4. Congress passes a law regulating the wholesale and retail prices of

“every purchase of an automobile in the United States.” The strongest
argument in support of the constitutionality of such a statute is that

(A) taken as a whole, the domestic purchases and sales of such

products affect interstate commerce.

(B) the United States Constitution expressly authorizes Congress to

pass laws for the general welfare.

(C) Congress has the authority to regulate the prices of products

purchased and sold because commerce includes buying and selling.

(D) Congress has the right to regulate interstate transportation and the

importation of products from abroad.

5. A federal statute directs payment of federal funds to states for use in

the improvement and expansion of state hospital facilities. The terms of
the statute provide that “No state shall award a contract for hospital
improvement or expansion financed in whole or in part by funds
received under this section unless said contract requires that the
contractor pay its employees a minimum wage of $10 per hour.”

A state contracted with a builder for the construction of a new wing on
the State Hospital, after receiving funds for that purpose under the
federal statute. The contract did not require the builder to pay its
employees a minimum wage of $10 per hour. Upon learning this,
federal officials demanded that the state either modify its contract with
the builder or return the funds received under the statute. When the
state refused, the federal government sued the state in federal court for
return of the money.

In the action by the United States against the state, the court should find
for

(A) the state, because fixing the minimum wage of employees is a

traditional state function.

(B) the state, because the regulation of hospitals and of construction

practices are traditional state functions.

(C) the United States, because Congress has the power to regulate the

way in which federal funds are spent.

97

(D) the United States, because some of the materials used in hospital

construction are traded in interstate commerce.

6. A bird is a rare species of quail found only in the state. Because its

flesh is tasty, it was hunted nearly to extinction until 30 years ago. At
that time, the state instituted conservation and game management
programs designed to preserve the bird. These programs included the
establishment of breeding preserves, the employment of ornithologists
to study the bird's habits, the passage of laws restricting the hunting of
the birds, and the employment of game wardens to enforce those laws.
The expense of maintaining the programs was financed in part by the
sale of hunting licenses. A recent statute passed by the state legislature
fixes the fee for a hunting license at $10 per year for state residents,
and $20 per year for nonresidents. A hunter who resides outside the
state was arrested in the state and prosecuted for hunting without a
license in violation of the statute. He defended by asserting that the
statute is unconstitutional because the hunting license fee for
nonresidents is higher than for residents.

Which of the following correctly identifies the clause or clauses of the
United States Constitution violated by the state hunting license statute?

(A) The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

(B) The Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth

Amendment.

(C) Both the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV and the
Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(D) Neither the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV nor the
Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

7. An organization asserts that government should be abolished. Its slogan

is, “What if they made a law and nobody obeyed?” Its published
literature urges all persons to violate laws, no matter how logical they
might seem, and in this way to help bring about the abolition of
government.

While in law school, a student joined the organization for the purpose
of acquiring material for a book that he was writing. Although he had
heard that the organization was dangerous and subversive, the student
thought its members to be fools and believed their slogan and
literature to be too ridiculous to ever convince anybody of anything.

98

So that he could have access to the organization's records, he
volunteered to be Party Secretary. In his capacity as such, he
frequently typed handbills written by the organization's Propaganda
Chairperson and arranged to have them printed for subsequent
distribution, although he did not intend for anybody to be convinced by
them. All of these handbills contained the organization's slogan and
urged the deliberate violation of laws. Eventually, the student wrote a
book about the organization. When he finished law school and applied
for admission to the bar, his application was rejected. The state bar
examiners stated that the only reason for the rejection of the student's
application was a state law that provided that “No person shall be
licensed to practice law who has belonged to any organization
advocating unlawful activity.” If the student brings an appropriate
judicial proceeding for an order directing the state bar examiners to
admit him to practice law, should the student win?

(A) Yes, because he joined the organization for the purpose of gathering

information for a book that he was writing.

(B) Yes, because he did not intend for the organization to succeed in

convincing people to violate laws.

(C) No, because he knew that the organization advocated unlawful

conduct when he joined the organization.

(D) No, because he played an active role in the organization's

activities.

8. A state statute requires cable television stations to set aside one hour
of airtime per week to be made available without charge for the
broadcasting of spiritually uplifting programs produced by recognized
religious organizations. The statute further provides that airtime
thereby made available shall be equally divided among Jewish, Roman
Catholic, and Protestant organizations. A religious organization known
as the American Buddhist League produced a spiritually uplifting
program but was advised by several cable television stations that it
could not be broadcast under the statute. The American Buddhist
League has instituted a proceeding in federal court challenging the
constitutional validity of the state statute.

The clearest reason for finding that the statute is unconstitutional is that
it violates

(A) the Free Exercise Clause, in that it treats religions unequally.

99

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

(B) the Establishment Clause, in that it is not closely fitted to furthering

a compelling governmental interest.

(C) the Equal Protection Clause, in that it applies only to cable

television stations.

(D) the Supremacy Clause, in that broadcasting is an area already

subject to extensive federal regulation.

9. When revolutionaries seized control of the government of a foreign
republic, they confiscated and nationalized several privately owned
businesses, including some belonging to citizens of the United States.
The President of the United States ordered the Secretary of Defense to
prepare to send troops into the country to protect United States
interests there. When the Secretary of Defense began giving
appropriate orders to military leaders, action was instituted in a
federal court for an injunction prohibiting the Secretary of Defense
from sending troops to the country. The plaintiff in that action asserted
that the President's order to invade the country violated a federal
statute that limited the President's power to invade such nations. The
Secretary of Defense asked the court to dismiss the case, on the ground
that it lacked jurisdiction.

Does the federal court have jurisdiction to issue the requested
injunction?

(A) No, because the President is Commander-in-Chief of the Army and

Navy.

(B) No, because the federal courts lack the power to review the

constitutional validity of a presidential order.

(C) Yes, because federal officials are subject to the jurisdiction of the

federal courts even when carrying out presidential orders.

(D) Yes, because the President lacks the power to order the invasion of

a foreign nation without a declaration of war.

10. A federal statute prohibits male employees of the United States Census

Bureau from wearing beards or moustaches, although no such
prohibition exists for employees of other federal agencies. The
plaintiff was discharged from his employment with the U.S. Census
Bureau for violating the statute by refusing to remove his moustache. If
the plaintiff asserts a claim on the ground that the statute was invalid,

100

his most effective argument is that the law

(A) denies him a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.

(B) invidiously discriminates against him in violation of the Fifth

Amendment to the United States Constitution.

(C) invidiously discriminates against him in violation of the Fourteenth

Amendment to the United States Constitution.

(D) deprives him of a property right without just compensation.

11. A state constitution contains an equal protection clause identical in

language to the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment
to the United States Constitution. The state legislature passed a law
empowering insurance companies within the state to charge different
rates for males and females where actuarial analysis revealed a
relationship between gender and increased risk. Shortly after its
passage, the plaintiff sued in the state court for a judgment declaring
that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the state
constitution. The trial court found the statute to be valid, and the
plaintiff appealed to the Court of Judicial Appeals, the highest court of
the state. The Court of Judicial Appeals affirmed the ruling of the
lower court.

If the plaintiff seeks United States Supreme Court review of the state
Court of Judicial Appeals decision, United States Supreme Court
review is available

(A) by appeal only.

(B) by certiorari only.

(C) either by appeal or by certiorari.

(D) neither by appeal nor by certiorari.

12. Congress passes the Federal Humane Act prohibiting the interstate

transportation of dogs for use in dogfighting competitions or
exhibitions. The defendant is prosecuted in a federal court for violating
the Federal Humane Act, and defends by asserting that the statute is not
constitutionally valid because it was enacted for purposes that were
entirely noncommercial. The most effective argument in support of the
constitutionality of the statute is that

(A) Congress is empowered to prohibit cruelty to animals under the

101

federal police power.

(B) the power to regulate interstate commerce includes the power to
completely exclude specified items from interstate commerce
without regard to congressional motives.

(C) under the “Cooley Doctrine,” the federal and state governments

have concurrent power to prohibit cruelty to animals.

(D) acts of Congress are presumptively constitutional.

13. A woman who was not a citizen of the United States applied for

temporary employment with the state. She was rejected, however,
because the Civil Service Law of the state prohibits temporary state
employment of a person who is not a United States citizen. The woman
sued in a state court for an order directing the state Civil Service
Commission to reconsider her application, on the ground that the
section of the Civil Service Law that prohibited the temporary
employment of noncitizens was unconstitutional.

The woman asserted that the section in question was invalid under the
Supremacy Clause. In determining the constitutionality of the section in
question, which of the following would be most relevant?

(A) The unemployment rate in the state.

(B) Federal civil service laws.

(C) The immigration laws and treaties of the United States.

(D) The percentage of persons residing in the state who are not citizens

of the United States.

14. Congress enacts the Truth in Selling Act, requiring that certain

disclosures be made by sellers in interstate sales transactions, and
fixing civil damages for failure to make the requisite disclosures. The
Act authorizes parties allegedly damaged by violations of the Truth in
Selling Act to sue in either state or federal courts. The Act further
provides that any decision of a lower state court construing a section of
the Truth in Selling Act may be appealed directly to the United States
Supreme Court.

The provision of this statute that authorizes appeal of a lower state
court decision directly to the United States Supreme Court is

(A) constitutional, because Congress has the power to regulate

102

interstate commerce.

(B) constitutional, because Congress may establish the manner in which
the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court is
exercised.

(C) unconstitutional, because Article III of the United States

Constitution does not authorize the United States Supreme Court to
directly review the decisions of lower state courts.

(D) unconstitutional, because it infringes the sovereign right of a state

to review decisions of its own lower courts.

15. Congress enacts the Aid to Education Act, which authorizes the direct
expenditure of federal tax funds for the purchase of computers and
audiovisual equipment that are then to be donated to private schools
for educational purposes. The Act makes the equipment available on
equal terms to religiously oriented and non-religiously oriented private
schools. However, a provision of the Act states that the equipment so
purchased and donated must be used solely for non-religious purposes
and non-religious education.

The parents of several students at public schools located in the state
have sued in federal court for an order enjoining the use of federal tax
funds for the purchase of equipment to be used by religious schools, on
the ground that such expenditure is unconstitutional.

Should the court issue the injunction?

(A) Yes, because expenditures of public funds for the purchase of

equipment to be used by religious schools violates the
Establishment Clause.

(B) Yes, because regulation of education is solely a function of the

states.

(C) No, because the petitioners lack standing to challenge the

expenditure of funds by the federal government.

(D) No, because the Aid to Education Act permits such expenditures

only for non-religious purposes.

16. An ordinance of the city provides for the election of a mayor every

four years. The ordinance makes all persons living in the city for one
year eligible to vote in mayoral elections. It specifies how a candidate

103

may have his or her name placed on the ballot, and provides that a
voter may vote for a person whose name is not on the ballot by writing
that person's name onto the ballot at a place provided for that purpose.

Although she was not associated with any political party, a lawyer
decided to run for the office of mayor. It was too late for the lawyer to
have her name placed on the ballot, so she campaigned for write-in
votes. Because many of the people she regarded as her constituents
were not United States citizens and did not read or write English, the
lawyer furnished prospective voters with self-adhesive stickers
imprinted with her name and told them that they could cast a “sticker
vote” for her by placing the sticker in the appropriate place on the
ballot. Because he feared that stickers would separate from the ballots
to which they were attached and attach themselves to other ballots, the
City Elections Commissioner advised the lawyer before the election
that sticker votes would not be counted.

The lawyer instituted a judicial proceeding for an order compelling
the City Elections Commissioner to count sticker votes on the ground
that his refusal to do so violated the constitutional rights of voters.
Which of the following would be the City Elections Commissioner's
most effective argument in support of the constitutionality of his
refusal to count sticker votes?

(A) The lawyer is not entitled to assert the constitutional rights of

others.

(B) The use of sticker votes would interfere with the accuracy and

convenience of ballot counts.

(C) Persons who are unable to read and write English should not be

permitted to vote.

(D) The use of sticker votes would enable a person to vote who was

not familiar with the issues or candidates.

17. The federal Interstate Riverboat Act provides that the minimum wage
for persons employed on river boats engaged in interstate commerce
shall be $6.50 per hour and authorizes the United States Department of
Labor to impose sanctions for violations of its provisions.

As part of a new tourism campaign, the state runs scenic cruises on a
river that serves as a border between it and another state. Persons

104

employed by the state as crew members are regulated by the state
Civil Service Code. Employees making less than $6.50 per hour assert
a claim against the state in a federal court for money damages
consisting of the difference between the wages they have been
receiving and $6.50 per hour as required under the federal Interstate
Riverboat Act. If the state moves to dismiss the action, should the
motion to dismiss be granted?

(A) Yes, under the doctrine of abstention.

(B) Yes, because the Eleventh Amendment to the United States
Constitution grants the states immunity from such actions.

(C) No, because the state employs the plaintiffs to engage in the
business of tourism, which is not a traditional state function.

(D) No, under the Supremacy Clause.

18. The defendant purchased several pornographic videotapes by mail

from a distributor of “adult” products and showed them to friends who
attended a barbecue at his home. The defendant was arrested and
charged with presenting an obscene performance in violation of state
penal code section 123. The distributor was charged with being an
accessory to the defendant's violation.

The defendant pleaded guilty and received a suspended sentence in
return for his promise to testify against the distributor in its
prosecution for being an accessory to the defendant's violation. In
defense against that prosecution, the distributor contended that, as
applied, penal code section 123 unconstitutionally violated the
defendant's constitutional rights. Does the distributor have standing to
assert a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights in its own
defense?

(A) Yes, because the videotapes the defendant had been prosecuted for

showing were purchased from the distributor.

(B) Yes, because any person may challenge the validity of a statute

regulating freedom of expression.

(C) No, because the defendant waived his constitutional rights by

pleading guilty to the prosecution.

(D) No, because no person may defend against a criminal charge by

asserting the constitutional rights of third persons.

105

19. To finance federal aviation services, a federal statute requires the
payment of an annual federal tax of $1,000 on every aircraft of a
certain size. The state Department of Farming owns an airplane that it
uses for aerial surveying of agricultural land in the state. Although the
size of the airplane makes it subject to the tax, the state paid the tax
under protest. If the state sues in an appropriate federal court for the
return of the tax payment that it made to the federal government, the
court should find for

(A) the state, because the power to tax is the power to destroy.

(B) the state, under the doctrine of state immunity.

(C) the federal government, under the doctrine of state subordination.

(D) the federal government, because the state receives benefit from

federal aviation services.

20. The honors program of the state's flagship university appealed to the

state, claiming that the large size of the program was starting to hurt its
effectiveness. In response, the state passed a new law limiting
enrollment in the program to only students who are in the top 5 percent
of their high school class or who score in the top 5 percent of the SAT
or ACT. Importantly, admissions officers are no longer able to take any
other factors into account, such as race, gender, economic
disadvantage, or sports and club membership. A group of concerned
citizens sues, arguing the honors college will not have as diverse of a
student body because race will no longer be taken into account in
determining enrollment. Is the new law constitutional?

(A) Yes, because courts will defer to institutional judgment in matters

of education.

(B) Yes, because it does not mention race or target racial minorities.

(C) No, because the law has a discriminatory effect.

(D) No, because the state has not shown the law is necessary to achieve

a compelling state interest.

21. The federal Protected Shellfish Act provides that contractors hired to

enforce the Act shall be exempt from the payment of state income taxes.
The state imposes a personal income tax on the income of persons
residing within the state. A contractor employed by the federal
government to enforce the Act derives his entire income from his
contract with the federal government. Although the contractor resides

106

in the state, he has refused to pay the state income tax.

If the contractor is prosecuted in a state court for failing to pay the
state income tax, which of the following would be the contractor's
most effective argument in defense against the prosecution?

(A) Income from federal employment is exempt from taxation by the

state.

(B) The state income tax imposes a burden on the federal government,
since it is likely to increase the costs of enforcing the Protected
Shellfish Act.

(C) The state does not have the power to tax income derived from

activities conducted on the high seas.

(D) Under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress has the power to

exempt federal contractors from the payment of state tax.

22. The state requires persons applying for state welfare assistance,

driver's licenses, admission to the state university, or certain other
state benefits to list their federal social security numbers as part of
their applications. In this connection, state agencies refer to an
applicant's social security number as his or her “Central File Number.”
The plaintiff has brought an action in a federal court against certain
specified state officials for an order enjoining them from using social
security numbers in this fashion. In support of his position, the plaintiff
argues that at some time almost all citizens of the state apply for some
form of state benefit, and that the compilation of a central file on each
citizen of the state is likely to have a chilling effect on the exercise of
rights granted by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The clearest reason for the dismissal of the plaintiff's suit is that

(A) the action is unripe.

(B) the question presented is moot.

(C) under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution,

state officials are immune to lawsuits of this kind.

(D) the creation of a central file on each person applying for state

benefits involves the resolution of political questions.

23. The city council passed an ordinance making it illegal to sell meat that
had not been certified by the city health department. A grocer was soon

107

arrested after selling uncertified meat. The grocer admitted violating
the ordinance but argued that the ordinance was not valid under the
United States Constitution.

Does the city's municipal court have jurisdiction to determine the
constitutionality of the ordinance?

(A) No, if determining the constitutionality of the ordinance requires

interpretation of the United States Constitution.

(B) No, because the grocer will not have standing to challenge the

constitutionality of the ordinance until he has been convicted of
violating it.

(C) Yes, because any court has the power to interpret the United States

Constitution.

(D) Yes, only if the municipal court is a state court under the laws of

the state.

24. After severe flooding in several states, Congress passed a law creating
grants available to state governments that could only be used to fund
new flood-control projects on state rivers and streams. The money
could not be used for any other purpose. A citizen group challenged the
law, arguing it was unconstitutional because it took away fiscal
decision-making from the states. Is the new law constitutional?

(A) Yes, because it necessarily affects interstate commerce.

(B) Yes, because Congress may tax and spend for the general welfare.

(C) No, because there is no indication the grants are limited to federal

property.

(D) No, because there is no indication the rivers and streams are

navigable waters.

25. In which of the following fact situations has there most clearly been a

violation of the plaintiff's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution?

(A) Plaintiff is a black person whose application for state employment
was rejected because he failed to pass the state Civil Service
examination. Statistics reveal that 10 percent of the black
applicants and 60 percent of the white applicants who have taken
the exam have passed it.

108

(B) Plaintiff is an American of Mexican descent who was denied
admission to a privately owned hospital solely because of her
ethnic background, but who received competent professional
treatment at a state hospital instead.

(C) Plaintiff is a Jewish person who resided in a federally operated
housing project, and who was excluded from a prayer breakfast
held by the federal agency that ran the project solely because of his
religion.

(D) Plaintiff is a woman whose application for employment as a deputy

sheriff was rejected by the county solely because of her sex.

26. The state recently passed a law that prohibits the drivers of trucks over
a certain length from driving within the state for more than four hours
without stopping to rest for at least 30 minutes. A trucker was
prosecuted for violating the law while driving a truck through the state
on an interstate run. As part of his defense, he asserted that the state
statute was unconstitutional in that it unduly burdened interstate
commerce. The trial court took judicial notice that there is no federal
law requiring interstate truck drivers to stop for rest breaks.

In view of the absence of a federal law requiring interstate truck
drivers to stop for rest breaks, which of the following is the state's
most effective argument in support of the constitutionality of the
statute?

(A) The absence of a federal law indicates that Congress does not

regard the matter as one requiring national uniformity.

(B) The requirement that truck drivers stop for rest breaks is largely a

matter of local concern.

(C) The statute requiring truck drivers to stop for rest breaks is

enforceable only within the state.

(D) In the absence of preemptive legislation by Congress, a state is free

to impose restrictions on interstate commerce.

27. A state statute known as the Unlawful Assembly Law contains the

following provision:

Section I—It shall be a misdemeanor for any group of three or more
persons to gather on a public sidewalk and to deliberately conduct
themselves in a manner that is offensive to passersby.

109

When the governor of the state refused to grant a pardon to a college
student who had been convicted of destroying state college property
during a campus protest, members of a student organization decided to
disrupt state government operations by conducting a loud and
boisterous demonstration outside a state government office building
that they selected at random. About 30 members gathered on the
sidewalk outside the building with noisemakers and musical
instruments and began marching while making a loud and disturbing
noise. Several persons who had business inside the building were
unable to get past the crowd of demonstrators to enter. The defendant,
one of the participants, was arrested for marching and shouting
obscene words that many passersby found offensive.

The defendant is prosecuted for violating Section I of the Unlawful
Assembly Law. He defends by asserting that the section is overbroad.
The court should find him

(A) guilty, because his conduct was in fact offensive to passersby.

(B) guilty, because the reasonable passerby would have been offended

by the defendant's conduct.

(C) guilty, because the reasonable person in the defendant's position
would have known that his or her conduct would be offensive to
passersby.

(D) not guilty, because some of the conduct that the law prohibited is

constitutionally protected.

28. In a certain presidential election, relations between the United States
and a foreign republic were the basis of a substantial disagreement
between the candidates, each supporting the view of his political party.
After taking office, the new President communicated with the U.S.
ambassador to the republic, who had been appointed by the former
President (a member of the opposing party) with the advice and
consent of the Senate. The new President demanded that the
ambassador either agree to support the foreign policy contained in his
party's platform or resign. When the ambassador refused to do either,
the new President told him that he was dismissed from the office of
ambassador.

Given the facts, did the new President have the power to remove the
ambassador from office?

110

(A) Yes, because ideological differences constitute cause for dismissal

from ambassadorial office.

(B) Yes, because the President has the power to dismiss ambassadors

without cause.

(C) No, because an ambassador appointed with the advice and consent
of the Senate cannot be dismissed from office without the advice
and consent of the Senate.

(D) No, because removal of an ambassador is a de facto withdrawal of

diplomatic relations with a foreign power.

29. The Assembly Appropriations Committee of the State Assembly of the
state was considering a bill that would appropriate state funds for
advertising the availability of abortion to indigent women. Prior to
discussion of the bill, the Committee directed the state attorney general
to seek an advisory opinion from the state court regarding the validity
of the proposed bill under both the state and the federal constitutions.
The attorney general made the appropriate ex parte motion pursuant to
the state procedure code before the Court of Errors, the highest court in
the state. The Court of Errors rendered an advisory opinion in which it
stated that the proposed bill did not violate the state constitution, but
that it did violate the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution.

The Assembly Appropriations Committee voted to reject the proposed
legislation in reliance on the advisory opinion of the Court of Errors.
Does the United States Supreme Court have jurisdiction to review the
advisory opinion rendered by the state Court of Errors?

(A) Yes, because it interpreted a section of the United States

Constitution.

(B) Yes, because the decision did not rest on an adequate state ground.
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
(C) No, because an advisory opinion is not a case or controversy under

the United States Constitution.

(D) No, because there has been no opportunity for appellate review by

a state court.

30. A city is home to a large state college, and many students rent houses
together in the city neighborhoods. Due to problems with noise, trash,
and other complaints, the city passes an ordinance making it illegal for

111

any one household to have more than five people under the age of 23
living under the same roof. A family with five children, ages 22, 21,
19, 15, and 14, challenges the law, arguing the law violates their
constitutional rights. Is the ordinance constitutional?

(A) Yes, because three of the children are legally adults and not part of

a protected class.

(B) Yes, because the ordinance is valid as a means of protecting the

health and welfare of city residents.

(C) No, because it violates the family's right of privacy.

(D) No, because there is no indication the law's effect will be limited

to students attending the state college.

31. In the Mutual Aid Treaty of 1957, the United States and a foreign

republic agreed to defend each other against aggression. In connection
with a century-old border dispute, one of the republic's neighbors
recently threatened to attack the republic if the republic did not
relinquish its claim to a certain peninsula. At the request of the
republic's prime minister, the President of the United States has
ordered United States troops to be flown to the republic immediately
for the purpose of defending the republic against attack.

If the President's order is challenged in an appropriate proceeding in a
federal court, the strongest argument in support of the validity of the
order is that the President

(A) has the power to declare war.

(B) has the power to commit United States armed forces to foreign

hostilities to satisfy treaty obligations.

(C) has the power to make treaties with the advice and consent of the

senate.

(D) is the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy.

32. A student attended a privately owned medical college. One weekend
during the school semester, the student was arrested by city police for
participating in a demonstration against the government's position on
nuclear disarmament. When the student was brought before a judge for
arraignment, however, the court dismissed the charge with the consent
of the public prosecutor. The following day, the dean of college called
the student into her office. The dean referred to the arrest and said that

112

because his conduct had embarrassed the school, the student was
expelled. The student subsequently sued the college for damages
resulting from his dismissal.

The most effective argument in support of the student's claim is that the
dismissal violated the student's right

(A) to an administrative hearing.

(B) to due process.

(C) to freedom of expression.

(D) under an implied contract with the college.

33. In which of the following fact situations is the plaintiff most likely to

have standing in a federal court to challenge the statute involved on the
ground that it is unconstitutional?

(A) The plaintiff is the chairperson of an organization dedicated to

preventing cruelty to animals. She sues in that capacity to enjoin the
enforcement of a state statute that permits state officials to seize
and destroy unlicensed dogs without notice to their owners.

(B) The plaintiff is a state in which mining is a major industry. It is

suing for a judgment declaring unconstitutional a federal statute that
imposes a tax on the mining of certain specified metals on the
ground that the tax invidiously discriminates against members of
the mining industry.

(C) The plaintiff is a federal taxpayer. He sues to recover taxes paid by
him under protest on the ground that the money so paid is being
used to support military activities against a nation with which the
United States is not at war, and that the statute authorizing its use
for that purpose is therefore unconstitutional.

(D) The plaintiff is a state taxpayer whose taxes are used, among other

purposes, to support the activities of local school districts.
Although she has no children of school age, the plaintiff is suing to
enjoin enforcement of a state law, the terms of which permit
counselors employed by local school districts to advise students
about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

34. After examining the effects of diesel exhaust on the environment,
Congress enacts a statute requiring the owners of diesel-powered
trucks used in interstate commerce to pay a diesel-powered vehicle use

113

tax of $800 per vehicle. A trucking company that operates more than
1,000 trucks in interstate commerce refuses to pay the diesel-powered
vehicle use tax and sues in a federal court for an injunction prohibiting
the enforcement of the tax statute. Which of the following is the
company's most effective argument in opposition to the tax?

(A) The tax is regulatory in nature.

(B) Imposition of the tax violates the company's right to Equal
Protection under the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution.

(C) The tax is so burdensome as to amount to a taking of private

property, for which just compensation is required.

(D) The tax is coercive in nature, since it is likely to discourage the use

of diesel-powered vehicles in interstate commerce.

35. Several years ago, the state legalized certain forms of gambling and
began issuing licenses for the operation of gambling casinos. Since
then, legal gambling has become the state's most economically
significant industry. People travel to the state from all over the United
States to visit nearly 2,000 licensed casinos located within the state.
All of the casinos discourage the use of cash at gaming tables and sell
chips for gamblers to use when participating in the games that they
operate. For this reason, many visitors to the state find themselves to
be in possession of chips when returning home. For the convenience of
tourists, the state legislature passed the Casino Chip Law requiring
restaurants and retail business located at state airports, train stations,
and bus terminals to accept chips from customers in lieu of cash, at
two-thirds the face value of the chips so tendered. The owner of a
restaurant located at an airport in the state was prosecuted in a state
court for violating the state law by refusing to accept casino chips from
a customer who attempted to use them to pay for food purchased at the
restaurant.

If the restaurant owner defends by asserting that the law violates the
United States Constitution, which of the following arguments would
most effectively support his position?

(A) The law denied the restaurant owner due process, since it required
him to give up merchandise without receiving cash in return.

(B) By its terms, the law violated the Commerce Clause, since the

114

businesses that were subject to it were all involved in interstate
travel.

(C) The power to coin and fix the value of money is exclusively that of

Congress.

(D) Requiring the restaurant to accept casino chips in return for
merchandise is a taking of private property without just
compensation.

36. After several studies show United States students are falling behind on
their math scores when compared to other nations, Congress passes a
provision providing for the distribution of free math textbooks to
students in both public and private schools. The books contain no
mention of religion or religious instruction. The vast majority of
private schools in most states are religiously affiliated. A concerned
federal taxpayer challenges the provision, arguing it unconstitutionally
supports religious entities. Does the taxpayer have standing to make the
challenge?

(A) Yes, because any federal taxpayer can challenge congressional

spending authorizations.

(B) Yes, because the taxpayer's claim is based on a possible violation

concerning the limits of congressional spending authority.

(C) No, because there is no proof that any money freed up by the free

textbooks will be spent for religious purposes.

(D) No, because the taxpayer hasn't shown a sufficient nexus between

his claim and the book expenditures.

37. In 2009, the United States and a foreign republic entered into a treaty
by which each country agreed not to tax citizens of the other. Pursuant
to that treaty, Congress enacted the National Tax Immunity Act, which
exempts nationals of the republic residing in the United States from the
obligation to pay income tax to the United States. Recently, however, a
United States citizen living in the republic was prosecuted by the
republic's government for failing to pay the republic's income tax. Last
week, the President of the United States issued an executive order
requiring the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income tax
from the republic's citizens residing in the United States.

Which of the following persons would be most likely to have standing
to challenge the constitutional validity of the presidential order in a

115

federal court?

(A) An organization dedicated to the principle that the United States

should keep its promises.

(B) A United States citizen who owns land both in the United States and

in the republic.

(C) A citizen of the republic living in the United States.

(D) A representative of the republic's government suing on behalf of the

republic.

38. In an attempt to reduce air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels,
Congress passes the Fossil Fuel Use Tax Act, which imposes a tax
upon the owners of buildings heated by burning fossil fuels. The state
owns an office building which was once used to house state
government offices. Since the state government moved to new quarters,
offices in the building have been rented by the state to tenants engaged
in various aspects of private enterprise. Although the building is heated
by fossil fuels, the state has refused to pay the tax imposed by the
Fossil Fuel Use Tax Act. The federal government has commenced a
proceeding against the state for taxes due under the Fossil Fuel Use Tax
Act as a result of the use of fossil fuel to heat the building.

Which of the following is the most effective argument in support of the
federal government's position?

(A) Under Article I of the United States Constitution, Congress has

unlimited power to impose taxes.

(B) Protection of the environment is a legitimate reason for imposing a

tax.

(C) The states owe the federal government the obligation of paying

those taxes fixed by federal law.

(D) As applied, the Fossil Fuel Use Tax Act taxes the state's activities

as a landlord rather than as a state.

39. After examining studies indicating that chewing gum was directly

related to the incidence of tooth decay, the state legislature enacted a
law prohibiting the advertising of chewing gum in all media. Which of
the following is the clearest reason for holding the law to be
unconstitutional?

116

(A) A state may not interfere with commercial speech.

(B) The sale of chewing gum frequently involves interstate commerce.

(C) The law imposes a prior restraint on publication.

(D) There are less restrictive ways of protecting the public against

tooth decay that would be equally effective.

40. Congress enacted a statute making education through the 12th grade

compulsory. Which one of the following facts or inferences, if it was
the only one true, would be most likely to lead to finding that the statute
is constitutionally valid?

(A) The majority of people living in states that have inadequate
compulsory education requirements are members of ethnic
minorities.

(B) Educational levels in England, France, China, and Russia are
superior to those in several states in the United States.

(C) By its terms, the statute is applicable only to residents of the
District of Columbia and of United States military bases.

(D) The majority of schoolchildren in the United States move from one
state to another at some time during the first 12 years of their
education.

41. While serving a 10-year sentence for murder in state prison, the

defendant was accused of leading a riot that resulted in the death of a
prison guard. Without a hearing, the warden ordered the defendant
placed in solitary confinement for the remainder of his sentence. The
defendant sued in a United States district court for an order directing
his removal from solitary confinement on the grounds that he was
deprived of due process and that solitary confinement for the
remainder of his sentence was a cruel and unusual punishment. The
district court rendered judgment against the defendant, who appealed to
the United States Court of Appeals. The United States Court of
Appeals affirmed, and the defendant petitioned for certiorari to the
United States Supreme Court. While the defendant's petition was
pending, parole officials voted to release him from prison although it
was three years before the end of his sentence, on condition that he
meet with a federal probation officer once per month, that he seek
gainful employment, that he refrain from consorting with criminals, and
that he be returned immediately to prison upon violation of any of the

117

conditions of parole. In opposing the defendant's petition for certiorari,
the state's attorney asserted that his release from prison made the issue
moot.

Which of the following is the strongest reason for finding that the
issues presented by the defendant's petition are NOT moot?

(A) The defendant is no longer a prisoner.

(B) In granting parole, parole officials have acknowledged a violation

of the defendant's constitutional rights.

(C) The defendant's claim is capable of repetition if it evades judicial

review.

(D) The defendant might be returned to solitary confinement if he is re-

incarcerated for violating the conditions of his parole.

42. A state statute provides that no person can be elected to state office
who is not a citizen of the United States. The constitutionality of the
statute is challenged in an appropriate action by the plaintiff.

If the court hearing the plaintiff's challenge takes judicial notice of the
treaties and immigration laws of the United States, it will be because
they are relevant to the validity of the statute under

(A) the Supremacy Clause.

(B) the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

(C) the due process requirement.

(D) the doctrine of separation of powers.

43. Under which of the following circumstances is a court most likely to
uphold the constitutionality of a statute that requires the taking of a
loyalty oath by public employees?

(A) Only persons appointed to state office by the governor are required

by law to take the loyalty oath.

(B) The statute requires that the loyalty oath be taken by all state

employees.

(C) The loyalty oath required by the statute consists entirely of a

promise “to uphold the United States Constitution and to oppose the
overthrow of the state or federal government by unlawful means.”

118

(D) The loyalty oath is required only of persons appointed to positions
with the state militia that are likely to expose them to classified
information.

44. In an attempt to improve air quality, several states pass laws providing
that vehicles powered by diesel engines of more than a certain size
must be equipped with a specified smog-elimination system to be
driven on highways within the state. A trucking company challenges
such a law in the state on the ground that it unreasonably burdens
interstate commerce. Which of the following is the state's best
argument in support of the law?

(A) The law applies to intrastate as well as interstate shipments.

(B) The law applies to all vehicles traveling through the state,
including those that are garaged primarily in the state.

(C) The law is necessary to protect the health and safety of residents of

the state.

(D) Other states have similar requirements.

45. A coastal state has enacted the Ocean Fishing License Act, which
regulates the right to fish in coastal waters. Section 1 of the Act
provides that no person shall fish in the ocean from a vessel registered
in the state who has not obtained an ocean-fishing license from the state
Department of Fish and Game. Section 2 of the Act sets the fees for
ocean-fishing licenses at $10 per year for residents of the state and $20
per year for nonresidents. Section 3 of the Act provides that if any
section of the Act is found invalid for any reason, such finding should
not affect the validity of any other section of the Act.

Which of the following would provide the strongest basis for
declaring Section 1 of the Ocean Fishing License Act to be INVALID?

(A) A federal law that authorizes a federal agency to issue licenses for

fishing in coastal waters of the United States.

(B) The absence of any federal law regulating fishing in coastal waters

of the United States.

(C) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the

United States Constitution.

(D) The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United

States Constitution.

119

46. The state enacts legislation appropriating several million dollars of

state funds to be spent on conservation of agricultural lands within the
state. The statute directs the distribution of such funds to Agricultural
Conservation Districts geographically equivalent to the counties of the
state, authorizes the creation of such Agricultural Conservation
Districts, and empowers them with responsibility for administering
funds assigned to them. The statute provides that fiscal decisions of
each District shall be made by a Board of Governors to be elected by
its residents. The statute also provides that participation in district
elections is open only to persons who are able to pass a simple test of
reading and writing in the English language and who own agricultural
land within the geographic boundaries of the District, and that voters in
such elections may cast one vote for each acre of agricultural land that
they own within the District.

The constitutionality of the statute has been challenged by a litigant
who claims that it violates the “one person, one vote” principle. The
best argument in response to that claim is that the principle

(A) applies only to elections for statewide and federal office.

(B) does not apply where property rights are involved.

(C) does not apply because of rights reserved to the states by the Tenth

Amendment.

(D) does not apply because results of District elections will principally

affect the owners of agricultural land.

47. In a case where the constitutionality of a state law regulating the sale of
birth control devices is in issue, which party will have the burden of
persuasion?

(A) The state, because procreation involves a fundamental right, and

the law may have a substantial impact on that right.

(B) The state, because the state law is more likely to have a substantial

impact on women than on men.

(C) The person challenging the statute, since there is a rebuttable

presumption that all state laws are constitutional.

(D) The person challenging the statute, since the regulation on non-

expressive sexual conduct is reserved to for the states by the Tenth
Amendment.

48. A state law makes it a crime to interfere with “any right conferred by

the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution.” In which one of the following cases is the
defendant LEAST likely to be convicted of violating the law?

(A) The defendant, the manager of an apartment building funded and

operated by a federal housing agency, refused to rent an apartment
to a black family solely because of their race.

(B) The defendant, the commissioner of police of a large city, refused
to hire homosexuals as police officers solely because of their
sexual preference.

(C) The defendant, threatening violence, induced a school bus driver,
employed by a public school district, to refuse Jewish students
rides solely because of their religion.

(D) The defendant, the proprietor of a restaurant located in a state
office building and rented from the state, refused to serve
Vietnamese immigrants solely because of their place of national
origin.

49. After the state raised property taxes, the defendant became active in an
organization against tax raises. As part of a protest, the defendant
paraded nude in front of the tax collector's office, carrying a sign that
read, “Soaring taxes take the clothes off our backs!” The defendant was
arrested under a statute newly enacted by the state legislature. The
complete text of the law was, “No person shall behave in a shocking or
offensive manner in a public place. Any violation of this section shall
be punished by a term not to exceed six months in a county detention
facility.”

If the defendant defends by asserting that the statute is unconstitutional,
his most effective argument would be that

(A) under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, expressive conduct

may not be punished by the state.

(B) the statute is vague.

(C) the reasonable person is not likely to have been shocked or

offended by the defendant's conduct.

(D) conviction under a newly enacted statute is a violation of due

process.

121

50. A law permitting the payment of public funds as financial aid to
schools operated by religious organizations is most likely to be
constitutionally valid if it directs payment to

(A) primary schools, for enhancement of the salaries of teachers who

do not instruct on religious subjects.

(B) primary schools at which no more than 10 percent of the

instructional time is spent on religious subjects, for the purchase of
laboratory equipment.

(C) secondary schools, for the purchase of textbooks on secular

subjects.

(D) colleges, for the purchase of athletic equipment.

51. Because a river is wide, deep, and flows through several states, it is an
important thoroughfare for interstate commercial cargo ships. The
state, through which the river flows, has passed a law imposing strict
water pollution controls on ships using rivers within the state. A
transport company that operates ships on the river has challenged the
statute, asserting that it violates the Commerce Clause of the United
States Constitution.

Which one of the following facts or inferences, if found to be true,
would be most likely to result in a finding that the statute is
constitutionally valid?

(A) The river is a source of water for agricultural irrigation in all the

states through which it passes.

(B) Congress has not prohibited state regulation of water pollution.

(C) Congress has enacted laws regulating water pollution in interstate

rivers.

(D) The company operates only within the state.

52. The defendant was a member of an organization that worshipped 12
different deities, each said to be in charge of a different field of
worldly activity. Each month of the year, the organization conducts a
festival dedicated to a different one of the deities. In March, a festival
was held to honor the goddess of love. As part of the festival, members
met to engage in activities involving nudity and group sexual
intercourse. Along with other members of the organization, the
defendant, who participated in the festival, was arrested by police

122

from the county vice squad. He was convicted of violating a state law
that made it a crime “for any adult to engage in sexual intercourse with
another while any third person is present.”

If the defendant appeals, the conviction

(A) must be overturned, because the group sexual activity was required

by a reasonable interpretation of the organization's religious
beliefs.

(B) must be overturned, because the conduct was part of the free

exercise of a religion.

(C) may be upheld, on the ground that an organization that worships

multiple deities is not a “religion” for First Amendment purposes.

(D) may be upheld, even if the group sexual activity was required by

the defendant's sincere religious beliefs.

53. A state statute made the distribution of birth control illegal. The law

had been on the books for 80 years, with one reported prosecution. Ten
married couples and a doctor challenged the law's constitutionality in
federal court. In doing so, they alleged that they violated the law
repeatedly. The court believed that it was very unlikely that the state
would enforce the law. The court should find

(A) the case cannot be decided because it is not yet ripe.

(B) the case cannot be decided because it is moot.

(C) the case can be decided because violation of the law is capable of

repetition.

(D) the case can be decided since the couples and the doctor have

admitted to violating the law.

54. A small political organization advocates racial segregation and

occasionally runs a candidate for election to office in the state. The
organization planned to hold a campaign rally at the state capitol two
weeks prior to the last statewide election. Because anonymous threats
of violence were received by the state police, however, a state court
issued an injunction prohibiting the organization from conducting any
public rallies until after the election. After the election was over, the
organization sought United States Supreme Court review of the state
court's decision.

123

The United States Supreme Court should

(A) review the state court's decision if the organization desires to hold

future rallies in the state.

(B) review the state court's decision, because any interference with the
right to assemble violates the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution.

(C) not review the state court's decision, since the question presented

has become moot.

(D) not review the state court's decision, since the aims of the

organization violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution.

55. In 1999, the state enacted the Energy Conservation Tax Rebate Act,
creating a state income tax credit for persons who installed solar
and/or wind-powered generators in residential realty. The plaintiff
began to install a solar generator in his home in the state in November
2012, but did not complete the installation until February 2013. In
December 2012, however, the state legislature repealed the Energy
Conservation Tax Rebate Act, effective January 1, 2013.

If the plaintiff challenged the repeal of the Act on the ground that it
was constitutionally invalid, his most effective argument would be that
repeal of the statute violated the

(A) Obligations of Contracts Clause.

(B) Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

(C) Privileges and Immunities Clause.

(D) Just Compensation Clause.

56. Congress passes a law requiring all females who are 18 years of age to
register for a new draft. A nonprofit organization advertises that it will
provide an attorney and defend without charge any female prosecuted
for failing to register. State statutes prohibit advertising by attorneys. If
the Bar Association of the state sues to enjoin further publication of the
advertisement in that state, the injunction should be

(A) granted, because state statutes prohibit advertising by attorneys.

(B) granted, since the advertisement could have the effect of

encouraging young women to violate the law.

124

(C) denied, since the advertisement constitutes commercial speech.

(D) denied, under the First Amendment to the United States

Constitution.

57. Congress passes the Schools Construction Act, providing for grants of
federal funds to states to help finance the construction of new school
buildings. A section of the Act provides that states that do not alter
their building codes to prohibit the use in school construction of certain
substances listed as carcinogenic (cancer-causing) are ineligible for
federal funds under the law. The state is the home of an industry that
produces one of the materials listed in the federal law as carcinogenic.
Its legislature has refused to alter the state building code to conform to
the requirements of the Schools Construction Act.

In a federal court, which of the following potential plaintiffs is most
likely to be able to obtain a judicial determination of the validity of
the section of the Schools Construction Act dealing with state building
codes?

(A) The parent of a child who currently attends a public school in the

state and who fears that the quality of education in the state will
decline if the state does not receive federal funds for school
construction.

(B) An organization dedicated to protecting the concept of “states
rights” against encroachment by the federal government.

(C) A taxpayer of the United States and the state, who fears that if the
state does not receive federal funds for school construction, her
state taxes will be increased to pay for school construction that
would otherwise have been federally funded.

(D) A building contractor who has been hired by the state to construct a
school building, under a contract that is contingent upon receipt by
the state of federal school-construction funds to which it would
otherwise be entitled.

58. A law in the state requires any person doing business in that state to

obtain a business license from the state's Department of Commerce. A
recently enacted amendment to that statute prohibits convicted felons in
the state from doing business in that state and authorizes the state's
Department of Commerce to deny a business license to any such
person.

125

The plaintiff, a convicted felon who was released from a state prison
after completion of his sentence, applied for a business license after
the passage of the amendment described above. He brings an action in
a federal court to enjoin the state's Department of Commerce from
enforcing the amendment against him on the ground that it is
constitutionally invalid.

The plaintiff's strongest argument is that

(A) states are forbidden by the Obligation of Contracts Clause from

interfering with the rights of felons to do business.

(B) the statute unreasonably interferes with the right of felons to travel

from one state to another.

(C) the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth

Amendment to the United States Constitution.

(D) he has already paid his debt to society and should be given the
opportunity to make a fresh start in life by engaging in a lawful
occupation.

59. Congressional legislation abolishing all legal penalties for gambling

could most easily be upheld

(A) as a regulation of interstate and international commerce.

(B) under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.

(C) if scientific studies showed gambling to be a harmless activity.

(D) if it applied only to the District of Columbia.

60. The plaintiff, a resident of the state, recently lost her job when her

employer went out of business. While employed, the plaintiff worked
on the night shift and attended college during the day. She applied for
unemployment compensation benefits under the state's Unemployment
Compensation Act. Although she was otherwise entitled to benefits,
she was denied them under a provision of the Act that prohibits the
payment of benefits to any person who attends school between the
hours of 8 A.M. and 6 P.M. After exhausting all administrative
remedies, the plaintiff appealed the denial of benefits, asserting that the
prohibition against payment of benefits to day students violated the
Equal Protection Clause.

Which of the following is the minimum finding that would result in a

126

ruling that the statute is constitutionally valid?

(A) The classification is a reasonable way of protecting a compelling

state interest.

(B) The classification has a rational basis.

(C) The receipt of unemployment benefits is a privilege rather than a

right.

(D) The payment of benefits to day students would result in a clear and

present danger.

61. The state requires all public and private hospitals to be accredited by

the state Department of Health, which is empowered to inspect hospital
facilities prior to accreditation and as a condition of continued
accreditation. All hospital employees are required to be licensed by
the Department of Health. The Department is also responsible for the
distribution of funds under a state law that provides financial aid to all
accredited hospitals for the purchase of equipment. The state law
makes each hospital's share proportional to the number of patients that
it treated the previous year.

A privately operated hospital accredited by the state denies admission
to whites except under emergency circumstances. An organization has
brought an action against the hospital in a state court for an injunction
directing it to discontinue its racially exclusionary policy on the
ground that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Which of the following is the strongest argument in
support of the position taken by the organization?

(A) Under the Fourteenth Amendment, no place of public

accommodation may discriminate against persons because of their
race.

(B) The licensing of hospital employees by the state requires the
hospital to act as the state would act in complying with
requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(C) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires
the state court to eliminate racial discrimination in places of public
accommodation.

(D) The state's involvement in hospital regulation and support makes
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment

127

applicable to the hospital.

62. In which of the following cases is the defendant's conviction most

likely to be reversed on constitutional grounds?

(A) The defendant is convicted of operating a theater showing

pornographic films in violation of a zoning ordinance that prohibits
such activity from being conducted within 500 feet of a school.

(B) The defendant is convicted of giving weekly parties at his home at
which obscene films are shown to persons who pay an entrance
fee, in violation of a county ordinance that prohibits the display to
groups of three or more persons of materials defined by state law
as obscene.

(C) The defendant, a professional bookseller, is convicted of selling an
obscene book to an undercover police officer, in violation of a
state law that provides: “It shall be a misdemeanor for any person
to sell or to possess for the purposes of sale any obscene book,
magazine, or other publication.”

(D) The defendant, a magazine publisher, is convicted of sending

obscene materials through the mails in a trial at which the court
permitted the introduction of evidence that the defendant advertised
his magazine in a way that pandered to the prurient interests of
readers.

63. Relations between the United States of America and another country
have been strained for the past four decades. In an attempt to improve
these relations, the President of the United States and the Premier of the
other country enter into a series of executive agreements. One of these
agreements requires the government of each country to discourage its
press from making derogatory references about the other country. At the
President's request and in support of that agreement, Congress enacts
the Friendly Nations Publications Act, which prohibits the publication
of certain specified disparaging statements about the other country in
any magazine or newspaper published by the armed forces of the
United States.

Which of the following would be the strongest argument against the
constitutionality of the Friendly Nations Publications Act?

(A) The President lacked the power to make an executive agreement
requiring the United States to discourage its press from making

128

derogatory references to the other country.

(B) The executive agreement could have been implemented in a less

burdensome manner.

(C) The executive agreement violates the First Amendment to the

United States Constitution.

(D) The Friendly Nations Publications Act violates the First

Amendment to the United States Constitution.

64. A police officer frequently visited a website where random users

could video chat with each other. After five minutes, the video chat
would switch to another random user in the system. Most users
engaged in sexually explicit conduct while on the site. The police
officer also engaged in sexually explicit conduct on the site, often
while in his uniform. The police department discovered that the officer
was using the site and fired him. The officer sued, arguing that the
firing violated his First Amendment rights. The police department
firing

(A) violated his right to freedom of speech.

(B) violated his right to freedom of association.

(C) violated his right to freedom of assembly.

(D) did not violate his First Amendment rights.

65. Congress passes a law that provides that whenever the President of the
United States delegates any person to travel to a foreign nation for the
purpose of negotiating an executive agreement, the President must
designate a member of the United States Senate to accompany and
advise that person. The President vetoes the law, but the presidential
veto is overridden by a two-thirds majority of both houses of
Congress. The President subsequently delegates an ambassador to
travel to a foreign nation for the purpose of negotiating an executive
agreement without appointing a member of the United States Senate to
accompany and advise the ambassador.

Which of the following arguments would most effectively justify that
action by the President?

(A) The President has sole and exclusive power over foreign affairs.

(B) The law unconstitutionally discriminates against members of the

129

House of Representatives.

(C) The law violates the principle of separation of powers by

interfering with the President's power to delegate authority in the
field of foreign affairs.

(D) A presidential veto of a law relating to foreign affairs is final, and

may not be overridden by Congress.

66. When the plaintiff declared herself to be a candidate for election to the

United States Senate from the state, the state Commissioner of
Elections refused to place her name on the ballot. The commissioner
said that his decision was based on the fact that state records indicated
that the plaintiff was only 27 years of age. The plaintiff subsequently
instituted a proceeding against the commissioner in a state court. After
examining state birth records, and after taking the testimony of the
plaintiff's mother and of a physician who was present at the plaintiff's
birth, the court found that the plaintiff was 30 years of age and directed
the commissioner to list her as a candidate. The plaintiff won the
election, but after she began her term of office, the Senate expelled her,
declaring that she did not meet the constitutional age requirement.

If the plaintiff institutes a proceeding in a federal court for an order
reinstating her to her seat in the Senate, which of the following would
be the most effective argument in support of a motion to dismiss her
proceeding?

(A) The plaintiff should be collaterally estopped from maintaining the

proceeding.

(B) No substantial federal question is presented.

(C) The plaintiff has already had her day in court.

(D) The plaintiff's claim presents a non-justiciable political question.

67. Congress passes the Federal Aid to Scholars Act, providing for grants
of federal funds to college and university students who meet certain
financial and scholastic standards. A provision of the Act, however,
restricts such payments to citizens of the United States. The plaintiff is
a foreign national studying at a university located in the United States
under an appropriate visa granted by the Department of State. If the
plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of the citizenship requirement
of the Federal Aid to Scholars Act, the court should rule that provision

130

(A) valid, because Congress has plenary power to regulate the rights of

aliens.

(B) valid, because resident aliens are not protected by the United States

Constitution.

(C) invalid, because it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment.

(D) invalid, because resident aliens are entitled to the same

constitutional protections as citizens.

68. After several natural disasters, a new state law required property

owners to permit cable television companies to install cable lines in
their buildings so that all state residents would have immediate and
reliable access to government notices, news, and other emergency
information. A landlord sued, arguing that the mandatory cabling
resulted in a taking. The landlord belonged to a church that believed
television violence was the main cause of several recent school
shootings. During trial, the state showed that the encroachment on
landowners' properties only consisted of cables less than ½ inch in
diameter and had a minimal economic impact on the property owner. In
determining the existence of a taking, the court should rule in favor of

(A) the landlord, because there was a physical invasion of the property.

(B) the landlord, because he belonged to a church that was anti-

television.

(C) the state, because there was an important countervailing interest in

informing the public during natural disasters.

(D) the state, because the physical invasion and economic impact of the

statute was minimal.

69. The Clean Roads Act authorized the state Department of Transportation
to determine without a hearing the identity of persons spilling toxic
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
chemicals on state highways and to order the removal of such
chemicals by such persons. The law also provided that failure to
comply with such an order within 30 days after receiving it was a
crime. On May 1, state investigators submitted a report stating that a
leak in the defendant's truck had caused the deposit of chemical
residues on roads within the state during the period from January 2012
through January 2013. The same day, the Department of Transportation
ordered the defendant to remove all chemical residues from the roads

131

of the state. The defendant refused to do so, and on August 15 he was
convicted of violating the Clean Roads Act by failing to comply with
the Department of Transportation order.

If the defendant appeals his conviction, his most effective argument
would be that the Clean Roads Act

(A) was an ex post facto law.

(B) was a bill of attainder.

(C) violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the

United States Constitution.

(D) violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to

the United States Constitution.

70. A recently enacted state statute provides that no person shall be granted
a high school diploma without first passing a series of examinations
designed to test minimum competency in reading, writing, mathematics,
and United States history. The statute requires that the examinations are
to be written by the state Board of Regents and are to be administered
on the same day throughout the state. It further provides that each high
school in the state may elect to have the examinations administered
either by its own employees or, without cost, by agents of the state.

The plaintiff, a taxpayer of the state, has sued in a federal court to
enjoin the state from enforcing the statute on the ground that the
administration of the examinations in religious schools by agents of the
state violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution. Which of the following is the most
effective argument against the plaintiff's claim?

(A) The plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of the

statute.

(B) The law does not discriminate among religions.

(C) The law has neither the effect nor the primary purpose of advancing

religion.

(D) The state has a compelling interest in the competency of high

school graduates.

71. A city ordinance provides as follows:

132

Section 1—No person shall conduct a public speech or demonstration
in  the  city  without  first  obtaining  an  assembly  permit  from  the  city
mayor, who shall not issue such a permit if, in his or her opinion, the
speech  or  demonstration  is  likely  to  result  in  a  breach  of  the  public
peace.

The defendant desired to hold a rally in the city. After submitting his
application for an assembly permit, the defendant stated in a radio
interview that he planned to lead the people at the rally to raid and
burn an abortion clinic operated by the city. Upon hearing the radio
broadcast, the mayor of the city denied the defendant's application.

The defendant conducted the rally, calling for the immediate
destruction by fire of the city abortion clinic. He passed flaming
torches to people in the crowd, saying, “Follow me, and we'll burn out
that nest of evil!” However, he was arrested as the crowd began to
follow him toward the abortion clinic, and he was subsequently
convicted of conducting a public rally without an assembly permit in
violation of the above ordinance. On appeal, the defendant's
conviction should be

(A) reversed, because prior restraint of speech or assembly is
inconsistent with the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution.

(B) reversed, because although punishment of the defendant's conduct

may be constitutionally valid, his conduct cannot be punished under
this ordinance.

(C) affirmed, because as a result of the defendant's attempt to incite

unlawful action, he lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality
of the ordinance.

(D) affirmed, because an ordinance that requires a permit for the

conduct of a public meeting is constitutionally valid.

72. A state statute provides that:

No producer of unrefined petroleum within the state may sell more
than half its annual production to buyers outside the state.

The plaintiff is a producer of unrefined petroleum within the state and
operates a trucking company for the transportation of his product.

133

There is no federal statute concerning the right of a state to regulate the
sale of unrefined petroleum produced within that state. If the plaintiff
challenges the constitutionality of the statute in an appropriate
proceeding, which of the following would be the plaintiff's most
effective argument?

(A) The production and sale of unrefined petroleum is a matter of
national concern, requiring uniform federal regulation.

(B) The unrefined petroleum sold by the plaintiff remains in its original

package until it reaches the ultimate consumer.

(C) The state's attempt to regulate the sale of unrefined petroleum in

interstate commerce violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the
United States Constitution.

(D) Regulation of the sale of unrefined petroleum is preempted by

congressional silence.

73. Congress passes the State Highway Subsidy Act, which makes

matching federal funds available to states for the construction of state
highways on condition that states receiving such funds prohibit trucks
longer than a specified size from operating on state highways. The state
has refused to amend its statutes to comply with the Act.

Which of the following persons is most likely to have standing to
challenge the constitutionality of the State Highway Subsidy Act?

(A) A taxpayer of the state who believes that if the state does not
receive matching federal funds for the construction of new
highways, the state's roads will soon become inadequate for use by
its residents.

(B) A federal taxpayer who believes that if the state does not receive
matching federal funds for the construction of new highways, its
roads will soon become inadequate for use in interstate commerce.

(C) A non-partisan political-action membership organization dedicated
to the preservation of “states' rights” that believes that the State
Highway Subsidy Act interferes with the state's right to regulate the
size of trucks using its highways.

(D) A road construction company that has a contract to build a road for
the state and that believes that without matching federal funds, the
state will be unable to honor its contract.

134

74. The defendant was convicted of murder in a state court after a trial in

which evidence was admitted over the defendant's objection that it was
obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. On appeal to the
highest court in the state, the defendant's conviction was affirmed.
After the defendant's petition for certiorari was denied by the United
States Supreme Court, he filed a petition for habeas corpus in the
appropriate United States District Court on the ground that the
evidence used to convict him was obtained in violation of his Fourth
Amendment rights. The defendant's petition for habeas corpus should
be

(A) granted, because the United States District Court may consider de

novo a constitutional challenge to the admissibility of evidence in a
state court.

(B) granted, because the defendant has exhausted all available state

remedies.

(C) denied, because the United States Supreme Court did not grant

certiorari.

(D) denied, because the state court has already determined that the
defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by
admission of the evidence.

75. The plaintiff's application for employment as a state police officer was
rejected pursuant to a state law that prohibited state employment of
“sexual deviates,” on the ground that he was a homosexual. The
plaintiff subsequently challenged the validity of the state law in a state
court, asserting that it violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the
constitutions of the United States and of the state, the language of which
is substantially the same. No state court has ever interpreted the phrase
“sexual deviates” as used in the state law.

While his state court action was pending, the plaintiff instituted a
proceeding in a United States district court seeking an order enjoining
the state police commissioner from enforcing the law described above
on the grounds that it violates the federal constitution's Equal
Protection Clause. If the court declines to grant the plaintiff relief, it
will most likely be

(A) based on the abstention doctrine.

(B) based on the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

135

(C) on the ground that the question is moot.

(D) on the ground that the plaintiff lacks standing.

76. A state statute requires hairdressers to be licensed by the State

Department of Education. The statute further provides that no person
shall qualify for a hairdresser's license who has not completed a
prescribed program of study, including a two-semester-unit course in
biology. The plaintiff, who held a valid hairdresser's license from
another state, moved to the state and applied to the state Department of
Education for a hairdresser's license. The plaintiff's application was
rejected on the ground that, although he had completed all other
requirements for a state hairdresser's license, he had never studied
biology as required by the state law. If the plaintiff seeks judicial
review of the denial of his application, his most effective argument
would be that the law

(A) has no rational basis.

(B) violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States

Constitution.

(C) discriminates against out-of-staters.

(D) violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth

Amendment to the United States Constitution.

77. The defendant placed the following advertisement in a magazine:

STEAMY FORBIDDEN SEX! The United States Supreme Court has
said  that  nobody  can  interfere  with  the  private  possession  of
pornography for private viewing in the privacy of your own home. SO,
NOW,  FOR  THE  FIRST  TIME  EVER,  we  are  offering  films  TOO
HOT  for  commercial  showing.  Fill  out  this  coupon  and  SEND  NOW
for  porno  too  sizzling  to  be  legal  in  theaters  or  clubs.  THIS  OFFER
AVAILABLE  ONLY  FOR  PRIVATE  POSSESSION  FOR  PRIVATE
VIEWING IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN HOME.

A federal police officer ordered films from the defendant by sending a
check to the address given in the advertisement.

After the officer received the films, the defendant was charged in a
federal court with violating a federal statute that prohibits sending
obscene films through the mail.

136

At the defendant's trial, an attempt is made by the prosecution to offer
into evidence a copy of the advertisement to which the officer had
responded. Upon timely objection by the defendant, the court should
rule the advertisement

(A) admissible, because pandering is not protected by the First

Amendment.

(B) admissible as evidence that the films sold by the defendant appeal

primarily to prurient interest.

(C) inadmissible as constitutionally protected commercial speech.

(D) inadmissible, because the advertisement is not itself obscene.

78. A United States ambassador was appointed by a former President with
the advice and consent of the Senate. Three days after taking office, a
new President requests the ambassador's resignation after the
ambassador posted a photo of himself online in the nude. Upon the
ambassador's refusal to resign, the President issues an order purporting
to remove the ambassador from office. Is the presidential order valid?

(A) Yes, because there was cause for the ambassador's removal from

office.

(B) Yes, because the President has the power to remove ambassadors

without cause.

(C) No, because the President may not remove an ambassador without

the advice and consent of the Senate.

(D) No, because the Senate has not ratified the order by consenting to

the appointment of a new ambassador.

79. The city, as part of an economic development plan for the city's

waterfront area, condemned 15 houses owned by the plaintiffs. The
properties were not blighted and were not rundown in any way. The
plan was to give the properties to a private developer to create new
office space. The plaintiffs challenged the city's action. The court
should rule in favor of

(A) the plaintiffs, because the houses were being given to a private

party.

(B) the plaintiffs, because the houses were in good repair.

(C) the city, because the houses were condemned as part of an

137

economic development plan.

(D) the city, because the condemnation resulted in mere land use

regulation.

80. A state statute provides that no license shall be issued for the marriage
of any male person below the age of 19 years or any female person
below the age of 17 years. An 18-year-old male desires to marry an
18-year-old female. Because of the provisions of the statute, however,
the boy has not yet asked the girl to marry him. If the boy challenges the
statute in a state court, asserting that it violates his rights under the
United States Constitution, which of the following would be the most
effective argument in opposition to the boy's claim?

(A) He lacks standing to challenge the statute.

(B) The statute has a rational basis.

(C) Females mature earlier than males.

(D) The right to regulate marriage is reserved to the states by the Tenth

Amendment.

81. A policy of the State University prohibits use of campus facilities by

persons or organizations without a permit from the University
Chancellor. The plaintiff, a student at State University, is president of a
student organization. On three occasions, the plaintiff's applications for
permits to use a classroom for meetings of the organization were
denied by the University Chancellor. The reason given by the
Chancellor was that the organization advocates interference with
freedom of speech as protected by the state's constitution.

Following the most recent denial of her application, the plaintiff
commenced a proceeding in a U.S. district court seeking an injunction
prohibiting denial of permits to the organization on the ground that it
violates the organization's constitutional right to freedom of assembly.
Before a hearing could be held on the plaintiff's claim, the University
Chancellor reversed his prior decision and granted the organization a
permit for the use of campus facilities, declaring that the philosophy
embraced by a student organization would no longer be considered in
deciding whether that organization would receive a permit for use of
campus facilities. If the University attorney moves to dismiss the
plaintiff's claim, the motion should be

(A) denied, because none of the University Chancellor's decisions were

138

based on an adequate state ground.

(B) denied, because the plaintiff's claim is one that is capable of

repetition and likely to evade judicial review.

(C) denied, because the plaintiff was damaged by past denials of her

application.

(D) granted, because the claim is moot.

82. After archaeologists discovered the fossil remains of a Stone Age

society in the state, Congress passed a law establishing “the National
Museum of Prehistoric Artifacts for the enjoyment and education of all
residents of the United States.” Under the statute, the museum was to be
built in the state, near the site of the archeological find. It was to be
funded entirely by the federal government, using revenues derived from
the national income tax. The federal law provided that the museum was
to display prehistoric artifacts and fossils gathered from all parts of the
United States, in addition to those artifacts that had been discovered in
the state. The attorney general of another state instituted a proceeding
in a federal district court for an injunction against the use of federal
funds to establish the National Museum of Prehistoric Artifacts in the
state, asserting that such expenditure would be an unconstitutional
disbursal of federal funds. Which of the following is most likely to
support a finding in favor of the constitutionality of the federal statute?

(A) The congressional spending power.

(B) The Commerce Clause.

(C) The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

(D) The doctrine of state sovereign immunity.

83. Because of a series of destructive forest fires in the state, the National
Preserve Service issues a regulation closing a national preserve to
public use from dusk to dawn. The national preserve is located entirely
within the state. Although the national preserve is a tract of land owned
by the federal government, people who have state fishing licenses are
permitted to fish in the preserve. As a result of the closing, there is a
reduction in the number of persons applying for state fishing licenses
and this causes a decline in state revenues. For this reason, the state
Department of Fish and Game institutes a proceeding in a federal court,
challenging the constitutionality of the regulation.

139

Which of the following would provide the National Preserve Service
with its strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of its
regulation?

(A) The Commerce Clause of Article I of the United States

Constitution.

(B) The Property Clause of Article IV of the United States Constitution.

(C) The federal police power.

(D) The federal government's right of eminent domain.

84. A state's economy was falling apart because of widespread home
foreclosures. The state passed legislation temporarily ordering a
moratorium on mortgage repayments. A local bank challenged the law,
arguing that the state was unlawfully interfering with private contracts.
During trial, the court found that the state was acting reasonably, and
the moratorium was in pursuit of a legitimate public purpose. The court
should rule in favor of

(A) the bank, because the state may not pass a law impairing the

obligation of private contracts.

(B) the bank, because the state may only pass laws impairing the

obligation of public contracts.

(C) the state, because the state is acting reasonably in pursuit of a

legitimate public purpose.

(D) the state, because only the federal government is subject to the

Contract Clause.

85. Because a revolution in a Central American republic threatens to

topple its government, the President of the United States orders federal
troops to invade the republic. Congress subsequently passes a
resolution directing the President to recall the troops. When the
President refuses to do so, a proceeding is instituted in a United States
district court seeking an order compelling the President to comply with
the congressional directive. Which of the following would be the
President's most effective argument in opposition to that proceeding?

(A) United States district courts lack power over the President.

(B) The President is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.

(C) The matter is a non-justiciable political question.

140

(D) The presidential order sending troops to the republic amounted to a

declaration of war.

86. A state statute makes it a felony for a person over the age of 21 years to
engage in sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years.
The statute further provides that if persons who are unrelated to each
other by blood or marriage spend more than three hours in the same
hotel room together, they are conclusively presumed to have engaged in
sexual intercourse.

The defendant was charged with violating the statute by engaging in
sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 years. The defendant
and the girl were not related to each other by blood or marriage. In its
instructions to the jury, the court said, “If you find that the defendant
and the girl spent more than three hours in the same hotel room, you
must find that they engaged in sexual intercourse.” The jury found the
defendant guilty.

If the defendant subsequently challenged the constitutionality of the
statute in an appropriate proceeding, the defendant's most effective
argument would be that the statute violated

(A) procedural due process requirements.

(B) substantive due process requirements.

(C) the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(D) the prohibition against bills of attainder.

87. The defendant, an alien convicted of murder in a state court, appeals
his conviction on the ground that aliens were systematically excluded
from serving on the jury.

A federal law prohibits aliens from serving on juries in state court
proceedings, but there is no state law creating such a prohibition. If the
defendant's appeal results in a reversal of his conviction, it will
probably be because the federal law

(A) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

(C) is invalid under the doctrine of separation of powers.

(D) is invalid under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI.

141

88. A state law provides that the names of prospective jurors in county
courts shall be drawn from the list of county residents holding state
driver's licenses. The plaintiff, a county resident, is a 22-year-old
black woman who does not hold a driver's license. She has never been
called as a prospective juror in the county court. In a federal court, the
plaintiff challenges the constitutional validity of the state law, claiming
that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. In support of her challenge, the plaintiff offers proof that
black women between the ages of 18 and 23 make up a large portion of
the population of the county, but that no member of this group holds a
state driver's license or has ever been called as a prospective juror in
the county court.

Evidence that no black women between the ages of 18 and 23 who
reside in the county hold state driving licenses should be

(A) excluded, because a state law does not violate the Equal Protection

Clause on its face unless its purpose is to discriminate.

(B) excluded, because a state law does not violate the Equal Protection

Clause as applied unless it is applied with a discriminatory
purpose.

(C) admitted, because a law that has a discriminatory effect may violate

the Equal Protection Clause even if its purpose is not to
discriminate and it is not applied with a discriminatory purpose.

(D) admitted, because the exclusion of black women between the ages

of 18 and 23 years may be evidence that the law had a
discriminatory purpose or was applied with a discriminatory
purpose.

89. In an attempt to improve the position of United States companies in the
world pleasure-cruise market, Congress voted to sell five former
battleships to a cruise line for $1 each. If a competitor of the cruise
line challenges the constitutionality of the congressional action in an
appropriate proceeding, the sale will probably be found

(A) invalid as a denial of equal protection under the Fourteenth

Amendment.

(B) invalid as a bill of attainder.

(C) valid under the Property Clause of Article IV.

142

(D) valid under the general police powers of Congress.

90. Under authority granted by Congress, the United States Department of
Defense awarded a contract to a company for the production of
airborne bombsights. The contract called for all work to be performed
at the company factory located on the banks of Winding River in the
state. A clause of the contract prohibited the company from discharging
more than three units per day of a pollutant into Winding River as a
result of bombsight production.

While producing bombsights pursuant to its contract with the
Department of Defense, the company routinely discharged between
two and three units of the pollutant per day into Winding River.
Subsequently, the state prosecuted the company for violating a state
statute that prohibits any person or business entity from discharging
more than two units of the pollutant per day into any river or stream
located in the state. In defense, the company asserted that as a federal
contractor, it was immune to regulation by the state.

Which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were
the only one true, would most effectively support the state's argument?

(A) Winding River is located entirely within the state.

(B) Prohibiting the discharge of more than two units of the pollutant per
day into Winding River would not increase the cost of producing
the bombsights called for by the contract.

(C) Congress has not expressly exempted the company from compliance

with state water pollution statutes.

(D) Winding River is not a navigable river.

91. Congress authorizes the National Park Service to sell trees grown in
the national parks. A logging company who also sells trees complains
that the National Park Service is engaging in unfair competition
because it sells trees for half the price charged by commercial
growers. The logging company files suit in federal court. In response,
the National Park Service immediately raises tree prices to the level
charged by commercial growers. The National Park Service then
moves to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that it is moot.

The National Park Service's motion should be

143

(A) granted, because the issue has been rendered moot by the price

change.

(B) granted, because Congress has the power to dispose of property

belonging to the United States.

(C) dismissed, because the National Park Service might lower its

prices again in the future.

(D) dismissed, because the proceeding involves the application of

Article IV of the United States Constitution.

92. Congress passes the Securities and Exchange Court Act, establishing
the federal Securities and Exchange Court. Under the Act, the new
court is to hear civil actions for damages resulting from federal
securities and exchange law violations. The Act also provides that
there is no right of appeal from decisions of the Securities and
Exchange Court, and that the Court will cease to exist at the end of six
years unless Congress specifically authorizes it to continue for an
additional period. If a defendant against whom a judgment is rendered
by the new court challenges the constitutionality of the Securities and
Exchange Court Act, which of the following arguments would be most
likely to result in a finding that the Act is unconstitutional?

(A) The Securities and Exchange Court Act does not require that judges

be appointed to serve for life.

(B) The provision that there is no right of appeal violates the Due

Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

(C) The United States Constitution does not provide for the

establishment of a federal court to hear prosecutions for federal
securities and exchange violations.

(D) The United States Constitution gives the Supreme Court the power

of judicial review over all inferior federal courts.

93. After negotiation, the President of the United States and the President

of the Republic of Ruritania reached an executive agreement. Under the
terms of the agreement, profits earned by Ruritanian corporations in the
United States would not be subject to taxation in the United States, and
profits earned by United States corporations in Ruritania would not be
subject to taxation in Ruritania. The plaintiff is a Ruritanian
corporation operating in the state. A state statute imposes a tax on all
income earned within the state and designates the State Revenue

144

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

Service as the agency that collects it.

The State Revenue Service demands that the plaintiff pay income tax
as required by state law. If the plaintiff challenges the state law, the
plaintiff's most effective argument would be that, as applied to the
plaintiff, the law is unconstitutional

(A) because no state may tax imports or exports without the consent of

Congress.

(B) under the Supremacy Clause.

(C) under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

(D) because the power to tax is the power to destroy.

94. Following an investigation by a congressional committee, an

impeachment proceeding was brought against a federal judge before
the United States Senate. The judge was not permitted to be
represented by counsel at the proceeding, although she asked for
representation and offered to pay for the services of her own attorney.
The Senate found that the judge engaged in improper acts and entered a
judgment of impeachment, removing the judge from office. The judge
subsequently asked a federal court to set aside the judgment on the
grounds that the denial of her request for representation by counsel at
the impeachment proceeding was a violation of her constitutional
rights. If the federal court refuses to grant the relief requested by the
judge, it will probably be

(A) because the Right to Counsel applies only to criminal prosecutions.

(B) under the doctrine of separation of powers.

(C) under the abstention doctrine.

(D) because a judgment of impeachment cannot extend further than to

removal and disqualification from office.

95. A city ordinance requires any person desiring to use public streets for
a parade to first obtain a parade permit from the Police Commissioner.
The ordinance sets forth procedures and requirements for obtaining
such a permit. The defendant challenged these procedures and
requirements in a federal court, and they were found to be
constitutional on their face. The defendant subsequently applied to the
Police Commissioner for a permit to conduct a street parade. Although
the defendant complied with all the requirements contained in the

145

ordinance, the Police Commissioner denied the application, saying,
“You look like a rebel to me.” Two months later, the defendant
conducted the parade and was arrested for parading without a permit in
violation of the ordinance described above. In defense, the defendant
asserted that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to him
because the Police Commissioner had arbitrarily and capriciously
denied his application for a parade permit. Which of the following
would be the most effective argument in response to the defendant's
assertion?

(A) There was sufficient time for the defendant to seek judicial review

of the Police Commissioner's denial of his application.

(B) The constitutionality of the statute is res judicata.

(C) The statute imposes a time, place, and manner regulation that is not

based on message content.

(D) The street is a traditional public forum.

96. Congress passes a law making it a crime in the District of Columbia to
operate any commercial motor vehicle that is not equipped with a
specified noise suppression device. If the constitutionality of the law is
challenged in an appropriate proceeding, the law should be declared

(A) valid as an exercise of the congressional police power over the

District of Columbia.

(B) valid as a reasonable exercise of the congressional power to

protect the environment.

(C) invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth

Amendment.

(D) invalid under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

97. The state enacts a law imposing a one-cent tax on each use of any
video arcade machine located within the state. All such existing
machines are equipped with coin slots that accept only quarters. Since
it would be too expensive to convert the coin slots to accept additional
pennies, the practical effect of the new law will be to require the tax to
be paid by video arcade operators. All such machines are
manufactured outside the state. Which of the following would be most
likely to have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute?

(A) A child who regularly plays video arcade amusement machines.

146

(B) An association of video arcade operators.

(C) An out-of-state manufacturer of video arcade amusement machines.

(D) A corporation located within the state that is in the business of
converting the coin slots on video arcade amusement machines.

98. Congress passes a law imposing a tax on the owners of buildings

containing insulating materials made of asbestos. The law provides
that funds derived from the tax shall be used to help finance research
into the treatment of diseases caused by exposure to asbestos. The
constitutional validity of the statute is challenged in an appropriate
proceeding on the ground that one of the purposes of the tax is to
discourage the use of asbestos insulation in buildings. The statute
should be declared

(A) constitutional, as a valid exercise of the congressional taxing

power.

(B) constitutional under the general federal police power.

(C) unconstitutional, because Congress does not have the power to

regulate the use of building materials.

(D) unconstitutional, because the law was passed for a purpose other

than to raise revenue.

99. A state law prohibits the ownership of land within three miles of the

coast by any person who is not a citizen of the United States.

Which of the following is most likely to have standing to challenge the
constitutional validity of the state law?

(A) An association of persons owning land in a community located
within three miles of the coast that asserts that the statute will
prevent the cultural growth of the community.

(B) A citizen who seeks to sell his property to a non-citizen and asserts

that the statute will prevent the sale.

(C) A state taxpayer who asserts that the statute will affect the price of

real estate, thereby reducing tax revenue.

(D) A real estate broker who asserts that the statute will reduce the

number of prospective purchasers of realty.

100. The plaintiff was a clerk in the back office of the State Department of

147

Motor Vehicles where he had minimal contact with the public. He was
strictly a clerical staff member and had no policy-making role. The
plaintiff read on his computer that someone had just tried and failed to
assassinate the President. The plaintiff turned to a co-worker and said,
“Hopefully the next guy will be a better shot.” The Department of
Motor Vehicles then tried to fire the plaintiff, claiming the remark
reflected poorly on the Department. The plaintiff claimed that such a
firing would violate his First Amendment rights. Can the Department
of Motor Vehicles lawfully fire the plaintiff for making the remark?

(A) Yes, because the remark had to do with a matter of public concern

and the plaintiff was a public employee.

(B) Yes, because the plaintiff's remark advocated the assassination of

the President.

(C) No, because the plaintiff had no contact with the public and no

policy-making role.

(D) No, because the plaintiff's statement did not signal any significant

job unfitness.

101. Which of the following state laws is LEAST likely to be declared

unconstitutional?

(A) A law that imposes a tax on all owners of real property within the

state, including the federal government.

(B) A law that imposes a registration tax on all vehicles garaged within

the state, including those owned by the federal government.

(C) A law that imposes a tax on all building contractors operating
within the state, including those who work exclusively for the
federal government.

(D) A law that imposes a tax only on persons who lease grazing land

from the federal government.

102. A local church was well known for going door-to-door ringing

doorbells and handing out flyers condemning homosexuality. Because
they wanted to make sure people were home to listen to their message,
church members would arrive on people's doorsteps either early in the
morning or late at night. After months of ruined breakfasts, dinners, and
bedtimes, an overwhelming majority of city residents signed a petition
asking the city to outlaw the passing out of handbills door-to-door. A
second petition signed by people who worked at night and slept during

148

the day asked the city to ban doorbell ringing for political purposes. In
their petition, the nightworkers showed that their productivity was way
down from lack of sleep, which adversely affected the city economy.
In response to the petitions, the city passed an ordinance that stated
“All doorbell ringing for the purpose of handing out handbills is
strictly forbidden.” The church challenged the new ordinance, claiming
it was unconstitutional. Is the new ordinance constitutional?

(A) Yes, because the church can spread its message in other ways.

(B) Yes, because an overwhelming majority of city residents wanted to

outlaw the passing out of handbills door-to-door.

(C) Yes, because the city ordinance allowed nightworkers to sleep

during the day, which was a public benefit.

(D) No.

103. Because there were limited facilities in the state for disposing of toxic
wastes, the state enacted a law prohibiting the disposal within the state
of toxic wastes generated outside the state. A manufacturing company
located outside the state had previously contracted for the disposal of
toxic wastes at a disposal center located inside the state. If the
manufacturing company brings an appropriate proceeding challenging
the constitutionality of the state law, the argument LEAST likely to
result in a finding that the law is invalid is that it violates the

(A) Obligations of Contracts Clause.

(B) Commerce Clause.

(C) Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(D) Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

104. A disastrous earthquake in Mexico resulted in the loss of thousands of
lives and the destruction of millions of dollars' worth of property.
Following the disaster, the President of the United States issued an
executive order sending U.S. military troops into Mexico to assist in
the evacuation of earthquake victims and in general recovery efforts.
Congress was not in session at the time. If the constitutionality of the
presidential order is challenged, which of the following arguments is
most likely to result in a finding that the President's action was
constitutional?

(A) The order was a valid exercise of the President's emergency

149

powers.

(B) The order was required by the humanitarian obligations of the

President.

(C) The President is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.

(D) The President has power over foreign affairs.

105. Congress passes a law that grants federal funds to states for the

purchase of equipment to be used in public hospitals for the treatment
of diseases caused by cigarette smoking. Paragraph 7 of the law
provides that “no state shall be eligible to receive such funds unless
said state shall have imposed a tax of seven cents on every package of
cigarettes sold in such state in addition to whatever cigarette tax is
already in existence at the time that this act takes effect.” From which
of the following does Congress derive the power to enact paragraph 7
of the law?

(A) The congressional taxing power.

(B) The congressional spending power.

(C) The general federal police power.

(D) The congressional power to regulate interstate commerce.

106. Because of extremely high unemployment in the state, the state requires
that state residents be given absolute preference over non-residents for
all jobs on the state oil pipeline. The requirement is

(A) valid, under the Contract Clause.

(B) valid, under the interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause.

(C) invalid, under the Contract Clause.

(D) invalid, under the interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause.

107. The Followers of the Holy Flame is a religious organization.

According to its religious philosophy, fire is symbolic of the presence
of the Creator in all living things. As part of their system of worship,
members of the Followers of the Holy Flame attend meetings once per
month at which all sit in a circle around a blazing campfire to sing
hymns and recite prayers. Usually, they attempt to conduct their
meetings on top of the highest mountain in the region, in the belief that
such a location is closest to Heaven. For the past several years, they
have conducted their monthly meetings on a mountain located in

150

Mountain Range National Park, a preserve owned and maintained
entirely by the federal government. This year, because of the danger of
wildfire, Congress passed a law prohibiting campfires anywhere
within Mountain Range National Park. An attorney representing the
Followers of the Holy Flame has commenced an appropriate
proceeding on behalf of that organization challenging the validity of the
law on the ground that it violates the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution by interfering with the free exercise of religion.

Which of the following would be the most effective argument in
support of the constitutionality of the law?

(A) The use of fire is not a traditional religious practice.

(B) In view of the danger of wildfire, the use of fire is not a reasonable

religious practice.

(C) The prohibition of fires within Mountain Range National Park does
not discriminate between religions and has a primarily secular
effect.

(D) The law is a valid exercise of the power granted to Congress under

the Property Clause of the Constitution.

108. After intense lobbying by an organization made up of professional

personal trainers, the state passed a law barring gyms from employing
any personal trainer who did not have a college degree in either
physical therapy or sports medicine. The legislature's stated intent
behind the law was to protect people from injury. A woman who had
been employed as a personal trainer for 15 years was fired from the
privately-owned gym she worked at because she did not have a
college degree. She filed suit to challenge the law, arguing the law
clearly disadvantaged people without the financial ability to attend
college.

Which statement is correct?

(A) The court will uphold the law because it involves issues of health

and safety.

(B) The court will uphold the law because it does not involve a suspect

classification.

(C) The court will hold the law invalid because a classification based
on financial ability is not substantially related to an important

151

government interest.

(D) The court will hold the law invalid because it regulates the

activities of privately owned gyms.

109. The state enacts the Continuing Professional Education Act, which
provides that all persons licensed by the state to practice any
profession other than medicine are required to complete 10 units per
year of state-approved continuing education studies as a condition for
renewal of their professional licenses.

An action is brought in a state court by an attorney in the state for an
injunction prohibiting enforcement of the Continuing Professional
Education Act and an order declaring it to be unconstitutional on the
ground that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution. Which one of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it were true, would most
effectively support a finding that the statute is constitutional?

(A) Competency in law is based upon the knowledge of principles that

change more quickly than those upon which competency in
medicine is based.

(B) A license to practice law is a privilege rather than a right.

(C) The power to license professionals is reserved to the states by the

Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

(D) The state bar association passed a resolution approving of the

requirements contained in the Continuing Professional Education
Act.

110. A federal statute directs payment of federal funds to states for use in
the improvement and expansion of state hospital facilities. The terms
of the statute provide that “No state shall award a contract for hospital
improvement or expansion financed in whole or in part by funds
received under this section unless said contract requires that the
contractor pay its employees a minimum wage of $10 per hour.”

A state contracted with a builder for the construction of a new wing on
the State Hospital after receiving funds for that purpose under the
federal statute. The contract did not require the builder to pay its
employees a minimum wage of $10 per hour.

152

Several employees of the builder who received less than $10 per hour
while working on the State Hospital expansion instituted an action for
damages against the state in a federal court, and the state moved to
dismiss their cause of action. Which of the following is the clearest
reason for dismissal of the suit?

(A) The state is immune from such an action under the Eleventh

Amendment to the United States Constitution.

(B) No federal question is involved.

(C) The state did not employ the plaintiffs.

(D) The plaintiffs voluntarily accepted the wage that the builder paid

them.

111. A state statute requires cable television stations to set aside one hour
of airtime per week to be made available without charge for the
broadcasting of spiritually uplifting programs produced by recognized
religious organizations. The statute further provides that airtime
thereby made available shall be equally divided among Jewish,
Roman Catholic, and Protestant organizations. A Buddhist organization
produced a spiritually uplifting program, but was advised by several
cable television stations that it could not be broadcast under the
statute. The organization has instituted a proceeding in federal court
challenging the constitutional validity of the state statute.

The state moved to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that the
organization lacked standing to challenge the constitutional validity of
the statute. Should the motion be granted?

(A) Yes, because an intellectual interest in the outcome of a

constitutional challenge is not a sufficient personal stake to confer
standing.

(B) No, because Buddhism is a recognized religion.

(C) No, because the organization produced a spiritually uplifting
television program that will not be broadcast because of the
statute's provisions.

(D) No, because the religious sensibilities of the organization are

offended by the statute.

112. A state constitution contains an equal protection clause identical in

language to the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment

153

to the United States Constitution. The state legislature passed a law
empowering insurance companies within the state to charge different
rates for males and females where actuarial analysis revealed a
relationship between gender and increased risk. Shortly after its
passage, the plaintiff sued in the state court for a judgment declaring
that the statute violated the equal protection clause of the state
constitution. The trial court found the statute to be valid, and the
plaintiff appealed to the Court of Judicial Appeals, the highest court of
the state. The Court of Judicial Appeals affirmed the ruling of the
lower court.

After the decision by the state Court of Judicial Appeals, the owner of
an automobile registered in the state sued in a United States district
court for an injunction prohibiting the state Insurance Commissioner
from authorizing different rates for males and females on the ground
that the statute empowering him to do so violates the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
If the insurance commissioner moves to dismiss the proceeding, the
motion to dismiss should be

(A) granted, because adequate state grounds exist for the validity or

invalidity of the statute in question.

(B) granted, under the abstention doctrine.

(C) denied, because the United States district court is empowered to
determine the validity of a state statute under the United States
Constitution.

(D) granted, because the Eleventh Amendment to the United States

Constitution prevents a federal court from hearing claims against a
state brought by citizens of that state.

113. A woman who was not a citizen of the United States applied for

temporary employment with the state. She was rejected, however,
because the Civil Service Law of the state prohibits temporary state
employment of a person who is not a United States citizen. The woman
sued in a state court for an order directing the state Civil Service
Commission to reconsider her application, on the ground that the
section of the Civil Service Law that prohibited the temporary
employment of non-citizens was unconstitutional.

The woman asserted that the section in question was invalid because it

154

violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution. Which of the following would be her
most effective argument in support of that position?

(A) The right to earn a living is a fundamental interest.

(B) All state discrimination against aliens is invidious since alienage is

a suspect classification.

(C) The section has no rational basis and is not necessary to serve a

compelling state interest.

(D) An alien is not a “person” for purposes of the Equal Protection

Clause.

114. A city ordinance provides for the election of a mayor every four years.
The ordinance makes all persons living in the city for one year eligible
to vote in mayoral elections.

The City Elections Commissioner advised a voter, who is not a citizen
of the United States but has been living in the city for 10 months, that
he will not be permitted to vote in the mayoral election because he
fails to meet the one-year residency requirement of the city ordinance.
Is the one-year residency requirement imposed by the ordinance
constitutionally valid as applied to the voter?

(A) Yes, because a municipality has a compelling interest in assuring
that voters will be interested in and familiar with the issues.

(B) Yes, because aliens have no constitutional right to vote.

(C) No, because a state may not make durational residency a

prerequisite for eligibility to vote.

(D) No, because although a state may establish durational residency

requirements for eligibility to vote, a requirement of one year does
not serve a compelling state interest.

115. The federal Interstate Riverboat Act provides that the minimum wage
for persons employed on river boats engaged in interstate commerce
shall be $6.50 per hour. However, the state's Civil Service Code
provides that crew members of riverboats engaged in interstate
commerce are paid from $6 to $8 per hour depending on seniority.

Persons employed by the state as riverboat crew members at wages
less than $6.50 per hour assert a claim in state court for money

155

damages consisting of the difference between the wages they have
been receiving and $6.50 per hour as required under the federal
Interstate Riverboat Act. The court should find for

(A) the employees, because as to them, the state Civil Service code is

superseded by the federal Interstate Riverboat Act.

(B) the employees, because the federal government has the power to set

minimum wages to promote the general welfare.

(C) the state, because fixing the wages of state employees is a

traditional state function.

(D) the state, because the state is immune from wage regulations under

the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

116. The defendant purchased several pornographic videotapes by mail and
showed them to friends who attended a barbecue at his home. The
defendant was arrested and charged with presenting an obscene
performance in violation of state law.

The defendant pleaded not guilty and asserted in his defense that, as
applied, the state statute violated his rights under the United States
Constitution. Which of the following would be the defendant's most
effective argument in support of his position?

(A) The statute violates the defendant's rights to freedom of speech and
the press because the right to hear, see, or read is part of the
freedom of expression.

(B) Application of the statute to the defendant is unconstitutional

because it violates the filmmaker's rights to freedom of speech and
the press.

(C) The defendant's constitutional right of privacy was violated
because it includes his right to privately possess obscene
materials.

(D) The law that the defendant is charged with violating was intended
to punish the publishers rather than the purchasers of obscenity.

117. To enforce the Protected Shellfish Act, the federal government

contracts with private enforcement agencies. The state imposes a
Building Rental Tax of $10 per year on tenants occupying rented
commercial space within the state. A contractor employed by the
federal government rents space for the conduct of his business in a

156

federal office building located in the state at an annual rental of $1.

If the contractor is prosecuted in a state court for failing to pay the
state Building Rental Tax, which of the following would be the
contractor's most effective argument in defense against the
prosecution?

(A) The Building Rental Tax violates the Equal Protection Clause of the

United States Constitution.

(B) The state may not tax the landlord-tenant relationship with the

federal government.

(C) The contractor's tenancy is specifically authorized by the Protected

Shellfish Act.

(D) The contractor is a federal contractor.

118. A grocer was convicted of violating a food safety ordinance by a city

municipal court. State laws do not permit appeal from judgments of the
city municipal court. The grocer seeks direct review by the United
States Supreme Court. Does the United States Supreme Court have
jurisdiction to review the decision of the city municipal court?

(A) Yes, because by convicting the grocer, the city municipal court has,
in effect, declared the ordinance to be valid under the United States
Constitution.

(B) Yes, because state laws do not permit appeal from judgments of the

city municipal court.

(C) No, because state law does not specifically authorize appeal of city
municipal court judgments directly to the United States Supreme
Court.

(D) No, because under Article III of the United States Constitution, the
United States Supreme Court may only review decisions of federal
courts and of the highest state courts.

119. A state statute known as the Unlawful Assembly Law contains the

following provision:

It  shall  be  a  misdemeanor  for  any  group  of  three  or  more  persons  to
engage  in  a  public  demonstration  on  a  public  sidewalk  in  front  of  any
state  government  office  during  regular  business  hours  unless  said
demonstration  is  related  to  matters  under  consideration  by  officials

157

employed in said government office.

The defendant took part in a public demonstration that prevented those
with business inside a state government office building from entering.
The defendant is prosecuted for violating the Unlawful Assembly Law,
and he defends by asserting that the section violates the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court should find
him

(A) not guilty, because the public sidewalk in front of a government

building is traditionally regarded as a public forum.

(B) not guilty, because the statute unlawfully regulates the subject

matter of demonstrations conducted outside government offices.

(C) guilty, because the state has a compelling interest in the orderly

conduct of governmental affairs.

(D) guilty, because the demonstration in which the defendant

participated kept persons with lawful business from entering
government offices to transact it.

120. The state legislature adopted a law allowing for the use of state funds
to advertise the availability of abortions to indigent women. The
plaintiff, a state taxpayer and the chairperson of an organization
dedicated to campaigning for the rights of unborn children, instituted a
proceeding in the federal district court for an injunction prohibiting
state officials from disbursing funds under the new law. Which of the
following is the best reason for the court to conclude that the plaintiff
has standing to challenge the statute?

(A) Any person has standing to challenge a statute on the ground that it

violates a First Amendment right.

(B) Unborn children are a discrete and insular class that cannot be

represented in any other way.

(C) The law involves a direct expenditure of state tax funds.

(D) The plaintiff is chairperson of a special-interest political group that
has a philosophical and moral interest in preventing enforcement of
the statute.

121. A youth organization with chapters and members in all 50 states

rejected a girl's application solely on the basis of her race, advising
her in writing that membership was open only to white children.

158

A federal statute makes it a crime for an organization with members in
more than one state to deny membership to any person on the basis of
that person's race.

The organization is prosecuted in a federal court for violation of the
federal statute. The organization asserts that the statute is invalid under
the United States Constitution. Which of the following would be the
prosecutor's most effective argument in supporting the constitutional
validity of the federal statute?

(A) The policy of the organization violates the spirit of the Commerce

Clause.

(B) The policy of the organization establishes a badge of servitude in

violation of the spirit of the Thirteenth Amendment.

(C) The United States Supreme Court has found racial discrimination to

violate the United States Constitution.

(D) Racial discrimination is inimical to the general welfare of the

citizens of the United States.

122. A student passed his state's licensing examination and petitioned the
state Board of Medical Licensing Examiners for a license to practice
medicine. Solely because of an arrest by the city police, the Board
refused to issue him a license. When the student was brought before a
judge for arraignment after the arrest, the court dismissed the charge
with the consent of the public prosecutor.

Because of the Board's refusal to license him, the student sued the
Board in state court and was unsuccessful. If the student sues the
Board in a federal court for an order directing the Board to license
him, the court should find for

(A) the Board, because a license to practice medicine is a privilege

rather than a right.

(B) the student, because the student first attempted to sue in a state court

and was unsuccessful.

(C) the student, because the Board's action was arbitrary and

capricious.

(D) the student, because the Board's decision deprives the student of

property without due process.

159

123. After examining the effects of diesel exhaust on the environment,
Congress enacts a statute requiring the owners of diesel-powered
trucks used in interstate commerce to pay a Diesel-Powered Vehicle
Use Tax of $800 per vehicle. A trucking company that operates more
than 1,000 trucks in interstate commerce refuses to pay the Diesel-
Powered Vehicle Use Tax and sues in a federal court for an injunction
prohibiting the enforcement of the tax statute.

Which of the following is the federal government's strongest argument
in opposition to the trucking company's claim that the Diesel-Powered
Vehicle Use Tax is invalid?

(A) The tax protects the general welfare by discouraging the use of

diesel-powered vehicles in interstate commerce.

(B) Protection of the environment is part of the federal police power.

(C) The tax is a valid exercise of the spending power since it enables
Congress to assure that the money that it gives states for the
construction of roads will be most efficiently spent.

(D) The trucking company lacks standing since it has not yet paid the

tax.

124. In 1999, the United States entered into a treaty with another country by

which each country agreed not to tax citizens of the other. Pursuant to
that treaty, Congress enacted the National Tax Immunity Act, which
exempts that country's nationals residing in the United States from the
obligation to pay income tax to the United States. Last week, the
President of the United States issued an executive order requiring the
Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income tax from the
country's citizens residing in the United States.

If the constitutional validity of the presidential order is challenged by
a person with standing to do so, the court should find that the order is

(A) valid, since the nation must speak with one voice in matters of

foreign affairs.

(B) valid, since the President has broad discretionary powers in

matters of foreign affairs.

(C) invalid, since the President may not abrogate foreign treaties

without the advice and consent of the Senate.

160

(D) invalid, since the President lacks the power to suspend enforcement

of the National Tax Immunity Act.

125. A state statute provides that no person can be elected to state office
who is not a citizen of the United States. The constitutionality of the
statute is challenged in an appropriate action by the plaintiff.

The plaintiff's challenge was heard by the highest appellate court of
the state, and the court declared the statute to be unconstitutional on the
ground that it violated the equal protection clause of the state
constitution. If the state seeks review by the United States Supreme
Court, which of the following statements is most accurate?

(A) The United States Supreme Court can properly review the decision

by certiorari.

(B) The United States Supreme Court can properly review the decision

by appeal.

(C) The United States Supreme Court can properly review the decision

by certiorari or appeal.

(D) The United States Supreme Court cannot review the decision.

126. A coastal state has enacted the Ocean Fishing License Act, which

regulates the right to fish in coastal waters. Section 1 of the Act
provides that no person shall fish in the ocean from a vessel registered
in the state who has not obtained an ocean-fishing license from the
state Department of Fish and Game. Section 2 of the Act sets the fees
for ocean-fishing licenses at $10 per year for residents of the state and
$20 per year for nonresidents.

An action is brought in a federal court by a resident of the state for an
injunction to prohibit the state from enforcing Section 2 of the Ocean
Fishing License Act. Which of the following arguments would be
LEAST likely to lead to a finding that the provisions of that section
are invalid?

(A) The Act violates the Commerce Clause.

(B) The Act violates the Equal Protection Clause.

(C) The Act violates the Necessary and Proper Clause.

(D) Section 1 of the Act is constitutionally invalid.

161

127. The state enacts legislation providing that participation in certain

elections is open only to persons who are able to pass a simple test of
reading and writing in the English language.

The constitutionality of the statute has been challenged by a litigant
who objects to the literacy requirement. If that challenge is successful,
it will probably be because the requirement violates

(A) the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) the “race, color, or previous condition of servitude” clause of the

Fifteenth Amendment.

(C) freedom of the press under the First Amendment.

(D) the Twenty-Sixth Amendment (granting the right to vote to persons

18 years of age and above).

128. Congress passes the Schools Construction Act, providing for grants of

federal funds to states to help finance the construction of new school
buildings. A section of the Act provides that states that do not alter
their building codes to prohibit the use in school construction of
certain substances listed as carcinogenic (cancer-causing) are
ineligible for federal funds under the law. The state is the home of an
industry that produces one of the materials listed in the federal law as
carcinogenic. Its legislature has refused to alter the state building code
to conform to the requirements of the Schools Construction Act.

In defending the validity of the section, which of the following
arguments would be most effective?

(A) The section is a necessary and proper extension of the

congressional power to regulate education.

(B) The states surrendered their authority over school construction by

accepting federal funds for that purpose in the past.

(C) The federal government can regulate school construction without

limitation because the federal government is paying for some of the
construction costs.

(D) It was reasonable for Congress to believe that compliance with the

section will assure that the federal money spent on school
construction will result in greater benefit than harm to the general
public.

162

129. A law in the state requires any person doing business in that state to

obtain a business license from the state's Department of Commerce. A
recently enacted amendment to that statute prohibits convicted felons in
the state from doing business in that state and authorizes the state's
Department of Commerce to deny a business license to any such
person.

The plaintiff, a convicted felon who was released from a state prison
after completion of his sentence, applied for a business license after
the passage of the amendment described above. He brings an action in
a federal court to enjoin the state's Department of Commerce from
enforcing the amendment against him on the ground that it is
constitutionally invalid.

A federal court will probably

(A) dismiss the action, because no federal question is involved.

(B) dismiss the action, since the plaintiff is a resident of the state

against which the action is being brought.

(C) hear the action, since the plaintiff is a resident of the state against

which the action is being brought.

(D) hear the action, since the plaintiff has asserted that the statute is

constitutionally invalid.

130. A recently enacted state statute provides that no person shall be
granted a high school diploma without first passing a series of
examinations designed to test minimum competency in reading,
writing, mathematics, and United States history.

A religious high school in the state sues in a federal court to enjoin
enforcement of the statute. In support of its petition, the school asserts
that its students belong to a religion that opposes all secular education,
and therefore the statute violates their rights and those of the school
under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution. Which of the following would be the most
effective argument in opposition to that claim?

(A) The school lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of the

statute.

(B) Opposition to all secular education is not a reasonable religious

163

belief.

(C) The law is not primarily intended to interfere with a religious

belief.

(D) The state has a compelling interest in the competency of high

school graduates.

131. A city ordinance provides as follows:

Section 1—No person shall conduct a public speech or demonstration
in  the  city  without  first  obtaining  an  assembly  permit  from  the  city
mayor, who shall not issue such a permit if, in his or her opinion, the
speech  or  demonstration  is  likely  to  result  in  a  breach  of  the  public
peace.

Section  2—A  fee  of  $10  shall  accompany  every  application  for  an
assembly  permit,  unless  the  application  is  for  a  permit  to  conduct  a
political campaign rally, in which case no fee shall be required.

Section  3—The  provisions  of  this  ordinance  are  severable,  and  a
judicial declaration that one section hereof is unconstitutional shall not
affect the validity of any other section.

Which of the following is the LEAST likely reason for holding that
Section 2 of the ordinance is invalid?

(A) Section 2 violates the Necessary and Proper Clause of the United

States Constitution.

(B) Section 2 discriminates against speech on the basis of its content.

(C) Section 2 is vague and/or overbroad.

(D) Section 1 is vague and/or overbroad.

132. A state statute provides that every carrier transporting unrefined

petroleum over roads within the state is required to pay a state
highway use tax based upon a formula that combines the quantity
transported and the distance over which it is moved within the state.

The plaintiff is a producer of unrefined petroleum within the state and
operates a trucking company for the transportation of his product.

If the plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of the statute in an
appropriate proceeding, which of the following additional facts or

164

inferences, if it was the only one true, would be the most likely to
result in a finding that the statute is unconstitutional?

(A) More than 50 percent of the transportation of unrefined petroleum
over roads in the state is connected with interstate commerce.

(B) There is no federal statute concerning the right of a state to tax the

transportation of unrefined petroleum within that state.

(C) The state imposes no tax on the transportation of any other product

within the state.

(D) The other states bordering the state have indicated an intention to
impose similar taxes on transportation over their highways.

133. Congress passes the State Highway Subsidy Act, which makes

matching federal funds available to states for the construction of state
highways on condition that states receiving such funds prohibit trucks
longer than a specified size from operating on state highways. The
state has refused to amend its statutes to comply with the Act.

The State Highway Subsidy Act is most likely to be held constitutional

(A) as an exercise of the general police power of the federal

government.

(B) as an exercise of the spending power of Congress.

(C) under the Property Clause of Article IV of the United States

Constitution.

(D) under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

134. A man applied for a job as a city clerk. He was later rejected based on
a state law that gave employment preference to graduates of state
colleges and universities. The man sued, arguing the law violated the
Equal Protection Clauses of both the United States and state
constitutions. The state court found the law valid under both
constitutions, and the state appellate court affirmed. The man appealed
to the highest court in the state, but his petition for certiorari was
denied. He now seeks judicial review from the United States Supreme
Court.

May the United States Supreme Court grant review?

(A) Yes, because the state court found the law was valid under the

165

United States Constitution.

(B) Yes, because the highest court in the state denied certiorari.

(C) No, because classification based on attendance at a college or

university is not a suspect classification.

(D) No, because there has been no determination on the merits by the

highest court in the state.

135. A federal police officer ordered pornographic films from the defendant

by sending a check to the address given in an advertisement. After the
officer received the films, the defendant was charged in a federal court
with violating a federal statute that prohibits sending obscene films
through the mail.

Which of the following may the court properly consider in determining
whether the films sold by the defendant are obscene?

(A) Expert testimony that the films have serious value as works of

erotic art.

(B) Expert testimony that activities in the films are likely to appeal to

the prurient interest of persons under the age of 18 years.

(C) Expert testimony that the films have serious value as art, and expert

testimony that the films are likely to appeal to the prurient interest
of persons under the age of 18 years.

(D) No expert testimony.

136. A state law sets the mandatory retirement age for public high school
teachers at 60 years for physical education teachers of either gender.

A 60-year-old public high school physical education teacher
challenges the law, asserting that it violates the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Which of the following
additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one true, would be
most likely to result in a finding that the statute is constitutional?

(A) The teacher is not as vigorous and healthy as he was at the age of

50 years.

(B) Physical education teachers must engage in strenuous physical

activities likely to be hazardous to the health of a person over the
age of 60 years.

166

(C) The state has the right to set the retirement age for teachers and

other state employees.

(D) State law provides that physical education teachers who reach the
age of 60 years must be given first preference in being hired for
other teaching positions for which they qualify.

137. The defendant, an alien convicted of murder in a state court, appeals

on the ground that aliens were systematically excluded from serving on
the jury.

A state law prohibits aliens from serving on juries in state court
proceedings, but there is no federal law creating such a prohibition. If
the defendant's appeal results in a reversal of his conviction, it will
probably be because

(A) a state law may not discriminate on the basis of alienage.

(B) the state law violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment.

(C) the state law violates the prohibition against discrimination on the

basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude contained in
the Fifteenth Amendment.

(D) the state law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI.

138. A state law provides that police rescue divers must be males between
the ages of 25 and 30. In its preamble, the law justifies itself by noting
the physical strength and stamina necessary to be able to perform the
job, including swimming in flood waters, lifting heavy objects off the
bottom of lakes, and breaking open submerged cars. A 32-year-old
woman challenges the state law, claiming it violates the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, she
argues that the law discriminates against people based on sex and age.

Which of the following statements is correct?

(A) The woman's claim for sex discrimination should fail if the law is

necessary to achieve a compelling state interest.

(B) The woman's claim for age discrimination should fail if the law is

substantially related to an important government interest.

(C) The woman's claim for sex discrimination should fail if the law has

a rational basis.

167

(D) The woman's claim for age discrimination should fail if the law has

a rational basis.

139. The state commences an appropriate proceeding to challenge the

constitutionality of an executive agreement between the United States
and a foreign country. Under the agreement, neither country can tax the
other country's corporations. Which of the following additional facts
or inferences, if it was the only one true, would be most likely to result
in a finding that the executive agreement was unconstitutional?

(A) The executive agreement was self-executing.

(B) If the state does not collect taxes from the other country's

corporations doing business in the state, the tax burden imposed on
other state residents will be increased.

(C) No federal statute authorizes the President to make executive

agreements with the foreign country.

(D) Prior to the agreement, Congress enacted a statute prohibiting the

President from agreeing not to tax foreign corporations without the
advice and consent of the Senate.

140. A federal act prohibited federal executive-branch employees from

getting involved in “political management or . . . political campaigns.”
The plaintiffs, a group of federal civil servants, attacked the
constitutionality of the act. In their complaint, the plaintiffs stated that
they wanted to engage in prohibited political activities, although they
were not specific as to what they were planning to do. However, they
conceded that they had not yet engaged in such activities. The court
should find

(A) the act is constitutional because the plaintiffs are federal

employees.

(B) the act is unconstitutional because it violates the plaintiffs' freedom

of expression.

(C) the act is unconstitutional because it violates the plaintiffs' freedom

of association.

(D) the plaintiff's action should be dismissed.

141. The plaintiff, who was employed as fire chief by a municipality of the
state, was required to retire under a state statute that mandated the
retirement of all fire department personnel at the age of 55 years.

168

The plaintiff institutes a proceeding against the state in a federal
district court, seeking an order enjoining the enforcement of the state's
mandatory retirement law on the ground that it violates the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiff's
application for an injunction should be

(A) denied, because the proceeding is barred by the Eleventh

Amendment.

(B) denied, because the law has a rational basis.

(C) denied, because the law is substantially related to important

government interests.

(D) granted, because the statute discriminates against a suspect class.

142. A city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the sale in the city of
meat processed at a processing plant not certified by the City Health
Department.

A person with standing to do so sues in an appropriate federal court
for an order enjoining enforcement of the city ordinance on the ground
that it is invalid under the Commerce Clause of the United States
Constitution. Which of the following is the best argument in support of
granting the injunction?

(A) As applied, the ordinance interferes with interstate commerce.

(B) Regulation of the purity of food is not a matter of local concern.

(C) The concurrent power to regulate commerce does not apply to

municipalities.

(D) There are equally effective and less burdensome ways of regulating

the purity of food sold in the city.

143. Congress passes the Schools Construction Act, providing for grants of

federal funds to states to help finance the construction of new school
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
buildings. A section of the Act provides that states that do not alter
their building codes to prohibit the use in school construction of
certain substances listed as carcinogenic (cancer-causing) are
ineligible for federal funds under the law.

The section in question is probably

(A) constitutional, on the basis of the federal police power.

(B) constitutional, on the basis of the spending power.

(C) constitutional, under both the federal police power and the

spending power.

(D) unconstitutional.

144. After severe flooding caused a deficit in the city's budget, the city

council imposed a new fee on users of city pools. In the past, the pools
had been free for all city residents. Under the new fee system, city
pool users could either buy a yearly membership for $500 or pay $5
per entry. The city pools were primarily used by low-income residents
who would likely be unable to afford the new fees.

Which group or person is most likely to have standing to challenge the
constitutionality of the new fee?

(A) A wealthy doctor who owns his own pool, but uses a city pool to

swim laps every day because it is closer to his office.

(B) A low-income family who does not use city pools, but fears the fee

will prevent them from using the pools in the future.

(C) An organization dedicated to promoting free access to city services

for low-income residents.

(D) An organization of city lifeguards that claims many of its members
will lose their jobs or have their hours cut if the new fee is not put
in place.

145. Traditionally, a park next to the local elementary school was used for

art fairs, concerts, political speeches, and other public functions. After
a political rally used posters and imagery that frightened several
children, the city passed an ordinance requiring all political speeches
to be moved to another city park one mile away. Non-political
functions were unaffected by the ordinance.

Which statement regarding the ordinance is most likely to be true?

(A) The ordinance is valid because it is a valid time, place, and manner

restriction.

(B) The ordinance is valid because the park is government property.

(C) The ordinance is valid if it is substantially related to an important

government interest.

170

(D) The ordinance is valid if it is narrowly tailored to achieve a

compelling governmental interest.

146. A state law provides that the names of prospective jurors in county
courts shall be drawn from the list of county residents holding state
driver's licenses. The plaintiff is a 22-year-old black woman who
does not hold a driver's license. She has never been called as a
prospective juror in a county court. In a federal court, the plaintiff
challenges the constitutional validity of the state law, claiming that it
violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In
support of her challenge, the plaintiff offers proof that no black woman
in the county between the ages of 18 and 23 holds a state driver's
license or has been called as a prospective juror.

If a motion is made to dismiss the plaintiff's claim on the ground that
she lacks standing, the motion should be

(A) granted, because the plaintiff does not hold a state driver's license.

(B) granted, because the plaintiff has never been called as a

prospective juror.

(C) denied, because being deprived of the opportunity to serve on a

jury is a concrete harm.

(D) denied, because the exclusion of black women between the ages of
18 and 23 could deprive the plaintiff of due process if she is ever a
litigant in a county court.

ANSWERS TO 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW QUESTIONS

1.  C  The  “case  or  controversy”  requirement  of  the  United  States
Constitution  requires  a  person  attacking  the  constitutionality  of  a
statute in a federal court to satisfy the burden of showing some actual
or  immediately  threatened  concrete  personal  injury  that  would  be
prevented if his or her challenge were sustained. Since the student has
not  yet  been  licensed  to  practice  law,  the  Continuing  Professional
Education  Act  does  not  affect  him;  declaring  it  unconstitutional  will
not  protect  him  against  immediately  threatened  injury.  He  therefore
lacks standing to challenge it.

A challenge to the validity of a statute on the ground that it violates
the  United  States  Constitution  is  a  federal  question.  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  A  claim  is  said  to  present  a  non-justiciable  political
controversy  if  its  adjudication  would  unduly  interfere  with  the
exercise  of  powers  of  co-equal  branches  of  government  or  with
national policy. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
federal  courts  are  not  required  to  wait  until  the  state  courts  have
acted before determining the constitutionality of a state statute.

2. D Under the Supremacy Clause, an otherwise valid state statute may be
superseded  by  federal  legislation  to  the  extent  that  the  two  are
inconsistent. The contract to kill the wild pigs in the national park was
authorized  by  federal  statutes.  Since  the  Property  Clause  gives
Congress the power to control federal property, the federal statutes are
valid, and so the state law that prohibits the killing of the wild pigs is
superseded, at least as to killings within the national park.

The power to protect the environment is held by both the federal and
state governments, so states do have the power to declare a species to
be  endangered  and  to  enact  legislation  protecting  it.  A  is  therefore
incorrect. Since the state statute prohibits the killing of wild pigs only
within the state, and since there is no indication that anyone other than
the exterminator is interested in coming from outside the state to kill
them or that killing them is commerce, the statute probably does not
unduly  interfere  with  interstate  commerce.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.
The Obligation of Contracts Clause prevents the state from interfering
with rights acquired under existing contracts but does not prevent the
state from prohibiting activities that parties might otherwise contract

173

to perform. C is therefore incorrect.

3. B Basic to freedom of religion is the rule that a court may not inquire into

the truth or reasonableness of a particular religious belief.

A is incorrect because in free exercise cases, the state's pursuit of a
compelling  state  interest  would  certainly  be  sufficient  (though  not
necessary)  to  lead  to  the  upholding  of  the  statute.  In  Wisconsin  v.
Yoder,  406  U.S.  205  (1972),  the  United  States  Supreme  Court
examined the sincerity of a claimant's religious beliefs in determining
whether a state statute as applied violated the Free Exercise Clause.
In doing so, the court referred to the fact that the belief involved was
of longstanding tradition. C and D are therefore incorrect.

4.  A  Under  the  Commerce  Clause,  Congress  has  the  power  to  regulate
commerce among the states. The Necessary and Proper Clause permits
Congress to do whatever is reasonably necessary to the exercise of its
enumerated  powers.  It  has  been  held  that  if  in  the  aggregate  a
particular  industry  has  an  impact  on  interstate  commerce,  Congress
may regulate even those aspects of it that are completely intrastate.

B is incorrect because no provision of the United States Constitution
gives  Congress  the  power  to  legislate  for  the  general  welfare  (i.e.,
federal  police  power).  C  is  incorrect  because  the  congressional
power to regulate commerce is limited to interstate commerce, or at
least  to  trade  that  has  an  impact  on  interstate  commerce.  D  is  a
correct statement, but it would not furnish an argument in support of
the  constitutionality  of  the  statute  in  question  since  the  statute
regulates “every purchase of an automobile in the United States,” and
this may include those that are sold domestically and intrastate.

5. C  Under  the  Necessary  and  Proper  Clause,  Congress  has  the  power  to
make  laws  regulating  the  use  of  federal  money  disbursed  pursuant  to
the spending power. This may enable Congress to control functions that
are traditionally those of the state.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  An  intrastate  activity  may  be
controlled by Congress under the Commerce Clause if its impact on
interstate  commerce  justifies  regulation  to  protect  or  promote
interstate  commerce.  D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  fact  that
some of the materials used are traded in interstate commerce is not,
alone, sufficient to establish such an impact.

174

6. D The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV requires each state
to  treat  nonresidents  in  the  same  manner  as  it  treats  residents.  An
exception  has  been  made,  however,  for  a  law  that  makes  it  more
burdensome  for  nonresidents  than  for  residents  to  exploit  a  state's
natural resources for recreational purposes. See Baldwin v. Montana
Fish  and  Game,  436  U.S.  371  (1978)  (holding  that  charging
nonresidents  a  higher  fee  than  residents  for  hunting  licenses  was
consistent  with  the  Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  Article  IV).
The  Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment
protects  only  those  rights  that  persons  enjoy  as  citizens  of  the  United
States (e.g.,  the  right  to  travel  from  state  to  state,  to  vote  for  federal
officials, to sue in federal courts, etc.). Since there is no federal right
to  hunt,  the  Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth
Amendment does not apply.

7.  B  A  person  in  an  organization  that  advocates  illegal  conduct  can  be
punished or disqualified for a state benefit only when he or she is an
active member of it, knows that it advocates illegal conduct, and has
the specific intent to bring about the accomplishment of its illegal goal.
Although  the  student  was  an  active  member  of  the  organization  and
knew  that  it  advocated  illegal  conduct,  he  did  not  intend  for  it  to
succeed  in  accomplishing  its  illegal  goal.  He  therefore  cannot
constitutionally be punished for his membership in it.

C and D are therefore incorrect. A  is  incorrect  because  freedom  of
the press applies only to the communication of ideas, and not to the
conduct involved in acquiring the information to be communicated.

8.  B  A  state  law  that  discriminates  among  religions  violates  the
Establishment  Clause  unless  it  is  closely  fitted  to  furthering  a
compelling  governmental  interest.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  statute  in
question  would  satisfy  that  test,  but,  in  any  event,  the  argument
contained  in  B  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  support  the
challenge. B is therefore correct.

A  statute  does  not  violate  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  unless  it
interferes with a practice required by a religious belief. Since there
is  no  indication  that  the  religious  beliefs  of  the  American  Buddhist
League  require  the  broadcasting  of  their  program,  A  is  incorrect.
Although the statute's discrimination against cable television stations
might  violate  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  C  is  incorrect  because
only  a  victim  of  that  discrimination  (i.e.,  a  cable  television  station)

175

would have standing to assert that challenge. D is incorrect for two
reasons: First, the power to regulate use of the airwaves is, to some
extent, shared by the federal and state governments, and second, the
Supremacy  Clause  makes  a  state  law  invalid  only  when  it  is
inconsistent with some valid federal statute affecting the same subject
matter. Since there is no indication that there is a federal statute that
differs from the state law in question, D cannot be the correct answer.

9.  C  Although  there  is  some  question  about  the  court's  ability  to
enforce orders directed at the President, it is clear that the court may
exercise  control  over  the  conduct  of  executive  officials  even  when
they are carrying out presidential orders.

B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Although  the  power  to  commit  troops  to
foreign  hostilities  without  consulting  Congress  is  one  of  the
emergency powers of the President, it may be limited in advance by
federal statutes. If the presidential order was, in fact, a violation of
the federal statute cited by the plaintiff, it may be held invalid. A is
therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  president  may
mobilize  troops  against  foreign  nations  in  the  protection  of  the
national interest without a declaration of war.

10. B By the process of “reverse incorporation,” the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment has been held to require equal protection from
the  federal  government  similar  to  what  the  Fourteenth  Amendment
requires  of  state  governments.  The  plaintiff  may  argue  that  since  the
statute  applies  only  to  employees  of  the  Census  Bureau  and  not  to
other  federal  employees  who  deal  with  the  public,  it  arbitrarily
discriminates against him.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibits  states
from  abridging  the  privileges  or  immunities  of  national  citizenship
but  does  not  prohibit  the  federal  government  from  doing  so,  and
because  the  right  to  wear  a  moustache  is  probably  not  protected  by
the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it is not fundamental. C
is  incorrect  because  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibits  invidious
discrimination  by  the  states,  but  not  by  the  federal  government.  The
Fifth  Amendment  prohibits  the  taking  of  private  property  for  public
use  without  just  compensation,  but  is  inapplicable  here  since  no
property has been taken from the plaintiff for a public purpose. D is
therefore incorrect.

176

11. D The decision of the state court was based solely on its determination
of whether the statute in question violated the state constitution. Since
the United States Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to interpret state
constitutions, it has no power to review the decision of the state court
interpreting its own constitution.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

12.  B  The  congressional  power  to  regulate  interstate  commerce  has  been
held to include the power to exclude whatever items Congress wants
to  exclude  from  commerce  between  the  states.  The  courts  do  not
usually  examine  congressional  motives 
the
constitutionality of such a statute.

in  determining 

A is incorrect because there is no federal police power. The “Cooley
Doctrine” provides that the commerce power, at least in part, is held
concurrently  by  the  state  and  federal  governments.  C  is  incorrect
because the “Cooley Doctrine” has nothing to do with the prohibition
against  cruelty 
to  animals.  Although  acts  of  Congress  are
presumptively constitutional, D is not an effective argument because
the presumption of constitutionality is a rebuttable one.

13. C Under the Supremacy Clause, an otherwise valid state law is invalid
if  it  is  inconsistent  with  a  federal  law  covering  the  same  subject
matter.  Since  the  immigration  laws  and  treaties  of  the  United  States
might  contain  provisions  that  are  inconsistent  with  a  state  law
restricting  the  employment  of  aliens,  they  would  be  relevant  to
determining its validity under the Supremacy Clause.

If  the  state  law  is  invalid  under  the  Supremacy  Clause,  it  is
unconstitutional no matter what the unemployment rate in the state is
and  no  matter  how  many  noncitizens  reside  there.  A  and  D  are
therefore incorrect. B is incorrect because federal civil service laws
regulate employment by the federal government and, therefore, do not
cover the same subject matter as the state's Civil Service Law.

14. B Article III of the United States Constitution gives the Supreme Court
appellate jurisdiction over all controversies arising under the laws of
the  United  States,  and  authorizes  Congress  to  determine  the  ways  in
which that jurisdiction shall be exercised. Since the Truth in Selling
Act is a federal law, the court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from
decisions construing it, and Congress may authorize appeals directly
from lower state courts.

177

The  power  to  regulate  interstate  commerce  may  empower  Congress
to authorize a statute requiring disclosures in interstate transactions,
but A is incorrect because the power to regulate interstate commerce
is separate from and unrelated to the power to regulate the exercise of
appellate jurisdiction by the Supreme Court. C  is  incorrect  because
Article III gives the Supreme Court jurisdiction over cases involving
federal  laws,  and  empowers  Congress  to  determine  how  that
jurisdiction  should  be  exercised.  Although  a  state  has  the  right  to
review the decisions of its own courts, the United States Constitution
gives  the  Supreme  Court  the  power  to  review  decisions  relating  to
federal laws. Its exercise of that power is thus constitutionally valid,
and not an infringement on the sovereignty of the states. D is therefore
incorrect.

15.  D  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  upheld  such  a  program  against
Establishment  Clause  attack  in  Mitchell  v.  Helms,  530  U.S.  793
(2000). A majority of the Court believed that the fact that the program
treated religious and non-religious schools identically was enough to
avoid  Establishment  Clause  problems,  so  long  as  there  was  no
evidence that the equipment was actually being diverted for religious
purposes.

A  is  incorrect  for  the  same  reason  that  D  is  correct.  B  is  incorrect
because  the  power  to  spend  for  the  general  welfare  includes  the
power  to  subsidize  education.  Since  the  use  of  tax  money  for
religious  schools  is  likely  to  reduce  the  amount  of  tax  money
available for use by non-religious schools, C is incorrect because the
petitioners have the necessary standing.

16. B Since the right to vote has been held to be a fundamental interest, state
interference with the right to vote is unconstitutional unless it can be
shown  to  serve  a  compelling  state  interest.  Since  the  state  has  a
compelling  interest  in  the  accuracy  and  facility  of  ballot  counts,  the
refusal  to  count  sticker  votes  will  be  valid  if  the  City  Elections
Commissioner  shows  that  it  serves  that  interest.  Although  it  is  not
certain that this argument will be successful, it is the only one listed
that could possibly support the Commissioner's position.

The  existence  of  certain  relationships  has  been  held  to  justify  the
assertion  by  one  person  of  another's  constitutional  rights.  A  is
incorrect  since  the  relationship  between  candidate  and  voter
probably  is  one  of  these,  and  because,  as  a  voter,  the  lawyer  is

178

asserting her own rights. A federal statute prohibits the use of literacy
tests in determining eligibility to vote. Even without it, however, C is
incorrect  because  it  would  not  eliminate  illiterate  voters  until  after
they  had  cast  what  they  believed  to  be  a  vote.  D  is  a  non  sequitur
since  familiarity  with  issues  and  candidates  does  not  logically
require the ability to write a person's name on a ballot, and because
most  traditional  voting  methods  (i.e.,  marking  an  “X”  or  flipping  a
lever) require no more literacy than the sticker vote method.

17.  B  The  Eleventh  Amendment  provision  that  the  judicial  power  of  the
federal  government  shall  not  be  extended  to  suits  brought  against  a
state by residents of another state has been held to prohibit the federal
courts from entertaining suits for money damages against a state by its
residents, unless authorized by valid federal statute. For this reason,
the  federal  court  action  against  the  state  by  its  employees  must  be
dismissed.

The  doctrine  of  abstention  prohibits  a  federal  court  from  deciding
constitutional  issues  that  are  premised  upon  unsettled  questions  of
state law upon which the determination of the action would depend.
Since no such unsettled question exists, A is incorrect. Tourism is not
a traditional state function, and since under the Commerce Clause the
federal  government  has  the  power  to  regulate  interstate  commerce,
the  Supremacy  Clause  makes  the  federal  Interstate  Riverboat  Act
supersede  the  state  Civil  Service  Code.  C  and  D  are  incorrect,
however,  because  under  the  Eleventh  Amendment,  the  federal  court
lacks jurisdiction to hear an action for damages against a state.

18. A Although a party challenging the validity of a statute is not ordinarily
permitted  to  assert  the  constitutional  rights  of  third  persons,  the
distributor may do so for two reasons: First, if the statute as applied
violated the defendant's constitutional rights, the defendant could not
be  guilty  of  violating  it,  and  the  distributor  could  not  be  called  an
accessory  to  the  commission  of  a  crime,  and  second,  vendors  have
been  held  to  have  standing  to  assert  the  constitutional  rights  of  their
customers.

B is incorrect because a person challenging the validity of any statute
on  any  constitutional  ground  must  have  standing  to  do  so.  C  is
incorrect  because  although  the  defendant  can  waive  his  own
constitutional  rights,  he  cannot  waive  those  of  the  distributor.  If  the
statute's application to the defendant was unconstitutional, convicting

179

the  distributor  of  being  an  accessory  to  it  would  violate  the
distributor's  constitutional  rights.  D  is  incorrect  because  it  is
overbroad.  Several  exceptions  to  this  general  rule  exist,  including
one  that  permits  a  vendor  to  assert  the  constitutional  rights  of  its
customers.

19.  D  Although  the  doctrine  of  state  immunity  prevents  Congress  from
exercising  its  commerce  or  taxing  power  in  a  way  that  substantially
interferes  with  traditional  state  functions,  there  is  no  reason  why  a
state should not have to carry its share of the burdens of government
by paying taxes for benefits that it receives. Since the federal tax in
question  is  applied  to  all  who  derive  benefit  from  federal  aviation
services, and since it does not interfere with a traditional function of
the state, it is valid.

The  power  to  tax  may  be  the  power  to  destroy,  and  for  this  reason
states  may  not  freely  tax  the  federal  government.  A  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  federal  government  is  not  under  the  same
restraint  in  taxing  the  states.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  doctrine  of
state immunity does not protect the state against paying its fair share
for the federal services that it receives. C is a fabrication; there is no
“doctrine of state subordination.”

20.  B  For  a  law  to  trigger  strict  or  intermediate  scrutiny,  it  must  have  a
discriminatory  intent.  A  mere  discriminatory  effect  is  not  enough  to
trigger  the  higher  levels  of  scrutiny  under  the  Equal  Protection
Clause.  There  is  no  indication  in  the  facts  that  the  law  is  meant  to
have a discriminatory intent, nor is there any indication or mention of
race in the law. In fact, it also bans admissions officers from taking
into  account  many  other  factors,  such  as  gender,  economic
disadvantage,  and  sports  and  club  membership.  Therefore,  C  and  D
are incorrect.

A is incorrect because there is no rule allowing an institution to do
whatever it wants in the name of education.

21.  D  Under  the  Necessary  and  Proper  Clause,  Congress  has  the  right  to
make  whatever  laws  are  necessary  and  proper  in  implementing  its
other powers. This right has been held to include the power to grant
immunity from state taxation.

Although the federal government is itself immune from state taxation,
the immunity is not derivative. For this reason, federal employees and

180

contractors  are  not  automatically  immune  from  state  taxation,  even
though such taxation may indirectly burden the federal government. A
and B are therefore incorrect. C is an incorrect statement of law since
it  has  been  held  that  a  nondiscriminatory  state  income  tax  may  be
imposed on state residents who derive their income from out-of-state
activities.

22. A  A  controversy  is  not  “ripe”  for  decision  unless  the  issues  are  fully
developed  and  clearly  defined,  and  not  merely  speculative,
conjectural,  or  premature.  Usually,  this  requires  a  showing  that
objective harm will occur if the issues are not decided. Mere general
allegations of a possible subjective “chill” are not sufficient to satisfy
this requirement.

A case is “moot” when no unresolved contested questions essential to
the  effective  disposition  of  the  particular  controversy  remain  for
court  decision.  B  is  incorrect  because  all  the  issues  raised  by  the
action  are  unresolved.  C 
the  Eleventh
Amendment  does  not  prevent  lawsuits  to  enjoin  state  officials  from
enforcing  laws  claimed  to  be  invalid.  A  question  is  political  if  its
resolution  would  unduly  interfere  with  the  operation  of  a  co-equal
branch  of  the  federal  government  or  with  national  policy.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

incorrect  because 

is 

23. C Since the United States Constitution is the supreme law of the land,
every court must determine whether the laws that it enforces violate
the Constitution either by their terms or by the way in which they are
applied. This necessarily involves interpretation of the Constitution.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the
municipal  court  determines  who  has  standing  to  appear  or  make
particular  arguments  before  it,  and  second,  even  if  the  municipal
court's  rules  regarding  standing  were  identical  to  the  federal  rules,
the  grocer  would  have  standing  because  the  possibility  of  his
conviction is sufficient to give him a personal stake in the outcome of
the constitutional argument. D is incorrect because every court has the
power to interpret the Constitution.

24.  B  Article  I,  Section  8  the  power  to  spend  for  public  purposes  that
provide  for  “the  common  defense  and  general  welfare,”  so  long  as
that  spending  does  not  adversely  affect  other  constitutional  rights.
Here,  providing  funding  for  flood-control  projects  is  clearly

181

beneficial for the general welfare, and there is no indication that any
other constitutional right is involved.

A  is  incorrect  because,  although  Congress's  actions  might  affect
interstate  commerce  (for  example,  the  rivers  and  streams  might  be
used  for  interstate  travel  and  commerce),  the  Commerce  Clause
generally  deals  with  federal  laws  that  directly  regulate  state  action.
Here, Congress is merely providing money, which makes B a better
answer. C is incorrect because there is no requirement that a federal
program  like  this  be  limited  to  federal  property.  D  is  incorrect
because  there  is  no  requirement  that  a  federal  program  like  this  be
limited to navigable waters.

25. D The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides
that “no state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws.” Actions of a county or other political
subdivision  of  a  state  are  regarded  as  state  actions.  The  fact  that
plaintiff's  application  was  rejected  solely  because  of  her  sex  would
probably  make  that  rejection  invidious,  and  a  violation  of  her
Fourteenth Amendment rights.

In A, the disparity between the pass rates of black persons and white
persons  might  be  evidence  that  a  law  is  being  applied  in  a
discriminatory manner, but it does not establish it conclusively. A is
therefore  incorrect.  Although  discrimination  based  solely  on  ethnic
background  may  violate  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  B  is  incorrect
because  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibits  state  action  only,  and
the discrimination in B was practiced by a privately owned hospital.
C  is  incorrect  for  the  same  reason  since  the  discrimination  was
practiced by a federal agency rather than a state one.

26. B Under the Cooley Doctrine, the state's power to regulate commerce is
held concurrently with the federal government's commerce power. If
an activity is one largely of local concern, the state may regulate it in
the  absence  of  a  federal  statute  indicating  congressional  intention  to
preempt  the  field.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  activity  is  one  requiring
national  uniformity,  the  state  may  not  regulate  it  in  the  absence  of  a
federal  statute  specifically  authorizing  regulation  by  the  states.  For
these reasons, the absence of a federal statute would establish that the
state  regulation  is  constitutional  only  if  the  activity  regulated  is  one
largely of local concern. Although it is not certain that the argument in
B  would  succeed,  it  is  the  only  one  that  could  possibly  support  the

182

constitutionality of the statute.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  absence  of  a  federal  statute  might  mean
that  Congress  regards  the  matter  of  rest  breaks  for  truck  drivers  as
one  requiring  national  uniformity  but  does  not  consider  a  statute
requiring  such  breaks  to  be  a  good  idea.  Although  the  statute  is
enforceable only within the state, it clearly has an effect on interstate
commerce.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  a  correct  statement  if  the
activity involved is not one requiring national uniformity. If, however,
it  does  require  national  uniformity,  the  states  are  not  free  to  impose
restrictions upon it unless authorized to do so by Congress.

27.  D  A  statute  is  void  for  overbreadth  if  it  punishes  expression  that  is
constitutionally  protected  along  with  expression  that  can  validly  be
punished.  Although  certain  types  of  offensive  expression  (including,
perhaps,  the  defendant's)  may  be  prohibited  by  statute,  a  law  that
prohibits  “offensive”  conduct  is  so  vague  that  it  may  also  end  up
punishing  constitutionally  protected  speech.  Such  a  law  is  therefore
overbroad.

A, B,  and  C  are  incorrect  because  a  person  whose  conduct  can  be
constitutionally  punished  under  a  statute  has  standing  to  assert  the
rights  of  persons  whose  conduct  is  unconstitutionally  prohibited  by
the statute. Thus, although it might have been constitutional to punish
the defendant's conduct, the law is constitutionally invalid because of
other  conduct  that  it  might  reach,  and  if  invalid,  cannot  be  enforced
even against the defendant.

28.  B  Although  the  Constitution  requires  the  advice  and  consent  of  the
Senate  for  ambassadorial  appointments,  the  United  States  Supreme
Court has held that the President may dismiss an ambassador at will
and without cause.

A  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  Whether  the  removal  of  an
ambassador constitutes a withdrawal of diplomatic relations depends
on  the  reason  for  the  ambassador's  removal.  D  is  incorrect  for  this
reason,  and  because  the  President  has  the  power  to  withdraw
diplomatic relations with a foreign government.

29. C  The  “case  or  controversy”  requirement  of  Article  III  of  the  United
States  Constitution  prevents  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  from
exercising jurisdiction in anything but a concrete dispute in which the
Court may effectively remedy damage to a legal right by rendering a

183

judicial  decree.  Since  an  advisory  opinion  does  not  determine  the
rights of any person, the opinion of the state Court of Errors is not a
case  or  controversy,  and  the  Supreme  Court  has  no  jurisdiction  to
review it.

A is therefore incorrect. If a state court's decision that a state law is
invalid rests on an adequate state ground, it is not subject to review
by the Supreme Court because such review would be futile. If a state
court's  decision  in  a  matter  that  qualified  as  a  case  or  controversy
were based on its interpretation of the federal Constitution, the United
States  Supreme  Court  could  review  it.  B  is  incorrect,  however,
because the advisory opinion of the Court of Errors was not a case or
controversy.  Where  a  constitutional  issue  is  involved,  the  Supreme
Court may review the decision of a state's highest court, even though
that decision was based on an exercise of original jurisdiction. D is
therefore incorrect.

30. C  The  right  to  marry  is  a  fundamental  liberty  interest,  and  the  United
States Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause's right of
privacy protects the integrity of the family. People who are related by
blood  or  marriage  have  a  right  to  live  together  in  a  common
household.  Here,  the  only  way  for  the  family  to  comply  with  the
ordinance  is  to  have  at  least  one  of  the  children  move  out.
Consequently, the ordinance clearly impinges on the family's right of
privacy, and is thus unconstitutional.

A is incorrect because the fact that some of the children are over 18
and may be considered legally adults does not change the fact that the
family's right to live together is being impinged by the ordinance. B is
incorrect  because  the  ordinance's  apparent  intention  of  protecting
health and welfare doesn't change the fact it impinges the integrity of
the family. D  is  incorrect  because  limiting  the  law's  effects  to  state
college students doesn't necessarily keep it from violating a family's
right to live together.

31. B The emergency powers of the President have been held to include the
power  to  commit  United  States  military  personnel  to  foreign
hostilities in satisfaction of existing treaty obligations.

A is incorrect because Article I of the Constitution grants the power
to declare war to Congress rather than the President. C  is  incorrect
because the validity of the treaty is not in issue. As Commander-in-

184

Chief,  the  President  is  the  ultimate  maker  of  military  policy.  D  is
incorrect,  however,  because  the  decision  to  send  troops  to  the
republic is a matter not of military policy, but of foreign policy.

32. D  Constitutional  guarantees  of  due  process  and  freedom  of  expression
protect only against government action. Since the college is privately
owned,  it  is  not  bound  to  give  the  student  due  process  or  to  avoid
interfering with his freedom of expression. Common law and contract
rights are thus the only ones that he may hope to enforce against the
university.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

33. C To have standing to litigate the constitutionality of a statute, a plaintiff
must show that he or she has a personal stake in the action. Federal
taxpayers do not usually have standing to challenge an expenditure of
federal money because their interest in the taxes that they pay into the
federal  treasury  is  too  remote  to  be  regarded  as  substantial.  If  the
federal  taxpayer  is  suing  to  recover  taxes  paid  under  protest,
however, he or she has the right to urge any appropriate objections to
the  validity  of  the  tax  —  including  a  constitutional  challenge  to  the
law  that  imposed  the  tax  or  directed  disbursement  of  tax  money
collected.

A is incorrect because a moral or intellectual interest in the outcome
of litigation is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a personal
stake in the action. B is incorrect because a state does not ordinarily
have  standing  to  bring  an  action  as  a  representative  of  its  citizens
since they are said to be protected by their political representation in
Congress.  State  taxpayers  have  standing  to  challenge  a  direct  and
substantial  expenditure  of  their  tax  money.  But  where  the  activity
involved has only a tenuous relationship to an expenditure of funds, it
is  necessary  for  the  plaintiff  to  show  a  direct  injury  to  his  or  her
financial interest. D is incorrect because no such injury is shown to
exist.

34. B The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits arbitrary
discrimination by the federal government. Since the law requires the
payment of a tax by diesel-powered vehicle users that is not required
from non-diesel-powered vehicle users, it is possible to argue that the
law  discriminates  against  the  operators  of  diesel  vehicles.  The
argument  is  very  likely  to  fail  since  the  prohibition  falls  before  an

185

overriding national interest, but it is the only one listed that has any
chance of success whatsoever.

A is incorrect because the fact that the tax has a regulatory effect is
not,  alone,  enough  to  make  it  invalid.  The  argument  that  a  tax  is  so
burdensome as to constitute an unconstitutional taking has been held
to be a political question for which appropriate judicial standards of
judgment are not available. C is therefore incorrect. The use of a tax
to  discourage  certain  activities  has  been  upheld  if  it  is  imposed  to
accomplish  an  objective  within  the  scope  of  some  other  delegated
power. D is incorrect because the tax is probably justified under the
Commerce Clause.

35. C Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution grants Congress
the  exclusive  right  to  “coin  money  and  regulate  the  value  thereof.”
Since  the  state  statute  requires  certain  businesses  to  accept  casino
chips  in  payment  for  merchandise  and  services,  in  effect  it  makes
those chips legal tender (i.e., money), thus exercising a function that
exclusively belongs to Congress.

the  requirement  of  due  process  applies  only 

Ordinarily, 
to
governmental  deprivations.  A  is  incorrect  for  this  reason,  and
because  the  Casino  Chip  Law  provides  a  method  for  the  persons
affected to be paid, and even to receive a profit (of one-third) for the
handling  of  the  chips.  According  to  the  Cooley  Doctrine,  the
commerce  power  is  held  concurrently  by  the  state  and  federal
governments. B  is  incorrect  because  under  the  Cooley  Doctrine,  the
fact that state law affects interstate commerce is not, alone, sufficient
to  make  it  invalid.  Since  the  Casino  Chips  Law  requires  licensed
casinos  to  redeem  the  chips  at  face  value,  the  “taking”  (if  there  is
one)  is  not  without  compensation.  Although  the  restaurant  owner
might argue that the compensation is not “just,” the argument in D is
not nearly as strong as the one raised by C, to which there is really no
possible response.

36.  B  Generally,  federal  taxpayers  do  not  have  standing  to  challenge  the
spending  of  tax  dollars  because  their  interest  is  too  attenuated.
However,  a  taxpayer  can  challenge  a  spending  measure  if  he  or  she
can  show  the  challenged  measure  was  enacted  under  Congress's
taxing  and  spending  power  and  exceeds  the  specific  limitations  on
this  power.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  stated  that  the
Establishment  Clause  is  such  a  limit  on  the  power.  Consequently,

186

since the challenge concerns the Establishment Clause and its limit on
congressional spending, the taxpayer bringing the challenge will have
standing.

A  is  incorrect  because  it  is  too  broad.  A  federal  taxpayer  does  not
have standing to challenge any and all spending authorizations for any
and all reasons. C  is  incorrect  because  the  issue  regarding  how  the
money  will  be  spent  does  not  affect  the  taxpayer's  standing.  D  is
incorrect because the term “nexus” usually applies to state taxation of
interstate commerce, which is not the situation here.

37. C  Standing  to  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  a  law  or  an  executive
order  requires  a  “personal  stake”  in  the  outcome.  This  requires  that
the plaintiff be threatened with immediate damage to his or her rights
that can be avoided if the court grants the requested relief. A citizen
of the republic living in the United States was immune from taxation
until the presidential order was issued, and under that order he will
be required to pay taxes. Sufficient personal stake thus exists.

A  is  incorrect  because  an  intellectual  or  political  interest  is  not
sufficient to give a plaintiff the personal stake required. B is incorrect
because a United States citizen was not immune from taxation before
the  order  and  therefore  has  no  personal  stake  in  having  it  declared
unconstitutional. D is incorrect because foreign governments have no
rights under the United States Constitution and therefore have no right
to seek its enforcement.

38.  D  A  federal  tax  on  state  activities  is  valid  so  long  as  it  is  non-
discriminatory and does not seriously interfere with the functioning of
state  government  as  a  sovereign  entity.  If  the  activity  on  which  a
federal tax is imposed is not one unique to the state government, the
tax  probably  does  not  interfere  with  the  functioning  of  state
government  as  a  sovereign  entity.  Since  the  building  is  rented  to
private  tenants  much  as  any  other  commercial  office  building,  the
state's  activity  in  operating  it  is  not  one  that  is  unique  to  state
government.

A  is  incorrect  because  Congress's  power  to  tax  is  subject  to  all
constitutional limitations. Although protection of the environment is a
legitimate  reason  for  imposing  a  tax,  a  state  will  be  immune  from
such  a  tax  if  it  interferes  with  the  functioning  of  the  state  as  a
sovereign entity. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect for the same

187

reason.

39. D  Although  the  state  may  interfere  with  commercial  speech  to  serve  a
substantial  governmental  interest,  it  must  not  do  so  in  a  way  that  is
unnecessarily  restrictive.  Thus,  even  though  the  state  may  have  a
substantial  interest  in  protecting  the  public  against  tooth  decay,  the
the  advertising  of  chewing  gum  would  be
law  prohibiting 
constitutionally 
less  restrictive  ways  of
there  are 
accomplishing  the  same  objective  (e.g.,  by  requiring  a  warning).
Although  it  is  not  certain  that  the  argument  in  D  would  result  in  a
finding  that  the  law  is  invalid,  it  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could
possibly support such a finding.

invalid 

if 

A is an incorrect statement of law since freedom of expression is not
absolute and may be interfered with to serve a substantial government
interest.  The  mere  fact  that  a  state  law  will  have  an  effect  on
interstate commerce is not enough to make that law invalid unless it
imposes  an  unreasonable  burden  on  interstate  commerce.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  Although  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  is
wary of laws that impose prior restraint on publication, it is far less
concerned  when  those  laws  affect  commercial  speech  only.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  speech  involved  is  commercial,  and  the  fact
that the law imposes a prior restraint is therefore not sufficient alone
to render it constitutionally invalid.

40. C Congress has the power to make laws regulating conduct on federal
property and in the District of Columbia, virtually without limitation.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  police  powers  of  the  states  include  the
power to regulate education. Although states must do so in a way that
does  not  deny  equal  protection  to  persons  within  their  jurisdiction,
there  is  no  constitutional  requirement  that  each  state  do  so  in  an
identical way. Some highly imaginative argument might lead a court
to conclude that if B were true, the statute would be valid under the
war and national defense powers of Congress, or that if D were true,
the  statute  would  be  valid  under  the  Commerce  Clause.  No  such
stretch of the imagination is necessary in C, however, so B and D are
incorrect.

41. D A question is moot when the issues that it raises have ceased to exist.
Although  the  defendant  has  been  released  from  physical  custody,
violations  of  the  conditions  of  his  parole  would  result  in  his  re-

188

incarceration  for  the  remainder  of  his  sentence.  Since  the  warden
ordered his confinement to be solitary for the rest of his sentence, a
return  to  prison  would  subject  him  to  enforcement  of  the  warden's
order. The issues raised by his petition have therefore not ceased to
exist.

A is incorrect because although the defendant is no longer in prison,
he was paroled on a conditional basis and could be returned to prison
for  the  remainder  of  his  sentence.  B  is  incorrect  because  there  are
many reasons why parole might be appropriate even if the defendant's
rights were not violated. Sometimes the nature of the judicial process
makes it impossible for the court to reach a decision in a particular
kind  of  claim  before  it  becomes  moot  (e.g.,  challenges  to  a  law
prohibiting abortion could never reach the Supreme Court before the
birth of a petitioner's baby). In such cases, if the claim is one that is
capable of being repeated but likely to evade judicial review, it will
not be moot even though the petitioner is unable to show that specific
damage will result from a refusal to hear it. The defendant's petition
is  not  such  a  case,  however,  because  there  is  no  indication  that  the
warden's order was part of a policy that would lead to repetition of
claims like the defendant's, and, even if it were, there is no indication
that subsequent claims by other prisoners are likely to become moot
before being reached by the Court. C is therefore incorrect.

42.  A  Under  the  Supremacy  Clause,  state  legislation  is  invalid  if  it  is
inconsistent with federal law. In a challenge to the constitutionality of
a  statute  excluding  non-citizens  from  public  office,  the  treaties  and
immigration laws of the United States might be relevant to determine
whether federal legislation has already addressed the subject, and, if
it has, to determine whether the state law is inconsistent with it.

B  is  incorrect  since  the  treaties  and  immigration  laws  of  the  United
States  are  not  relevant  to  determine  what  the  privileges  and
immunities of citizenship are. C is incorrect because substantive due
process  has  not  been  held  to  include  the  right  to  hold  public  office,
and procedural due process does not prevent the enactment of a law.
The  doctrine  of  separation  of  powers  refers  to  the  relationship
between  the  three  branches  of  the  federal  government,  not  to  the
relationship of state governments to the federal government, so D is
also incorrect.

43. C  An  oath  to  uphold  the  United  States  Constitution  and  to  oppose  the

189

unlawful overthrow of government is nothing more than a promise to
do something that public employees are legally obligated to do.

A, B, and D are incorrect because some loyalty oaths (such as those
that require a disclaimer of membership in organizations referred to
as  subversive)  have  been  held  to  deny  the  freedom  of  assembly  to
public officials who are required by statute to take them.

44.  C  A  state  law  that  burdens  interstate  commerce  is  valid  if  the  state
interest that the law is designed to protect outweighs the burdens that
the  law  imposes  on  interstate  commerce.  Although  not  enough  facts
are given to allow a determination of whether this is so in the instant
case, C is the only argument that offers any support at all to the state's
argument.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  the  law  is  likely  to  discourage
commerce  from  out  of  state,  even  though  it  applies  equally  to
intrastate  shipments  and  vehicles  garaged  within  the  state.  If  all  or
most  other  states  have  similar  requirements,  that  fact  might  be
relevant in determining that the burden on interstate commerce is not
an unreasonable one. But the fact that some other states have such a
requirement is not enough alone to establish that it is reasonable. D is
therefore incorrect.

45. A Under the Supremacy Clause, a state law that is otherwise valid may
be declared invalid if it is inconsistent with a federal law concerning
the  same  subject  matter.  If  there  is  a  federal  law  like  the  one
described  in  A,  the  Ocean  Fishing  License  Act  may  be  inconsistent
with it. If so, the Act will be invalid.

In the absence of any conflicting federal law, the state law might be a
valid  exercise  of  police  powers  or  revenue-raising  powers.  B  is
therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because there is no indication that
enforcement  of  Section  1  results  in  discrimination.  D  is  incorrect
because  the  Fifth  Amendment  imposes  restrictions  on  the  federal
government, but it is irrelevant to state action.

46.  D  Because  the  activities  of  Agricultural  Conservation  Districts  will
affect  only  owners  of  agricultural  land,  and  because  such  owners
constitute  a  narrow  class  of  persons,  elections  do  not  have  to  be
conducted according to the “one person, one vote” principle.

A  and  B  are  under-inclusive  since  the  “one  person,  one  vote”

190

principle applies to all elections that affect the general public. C is
incorrect  because  states  may  not  exercise  their  own  powers  in  a
manner  inconsistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  United  States
Constitution.

law 

47. A In a challenge to state interference with a “fundamental right,” or to a
that  allegedly  discriminates  against  a  “suspect
state 
classification,” the state has the burden of establishing that the law is
necessary  to  serve  a  compelling  state  interest.  The  United  States
Supreme  Court  has  characterized  marriage  and  procreation  as
fundamental rights.

B is incorrect because although gender-based classification is subject
to heightened scrutiny, the Supreme Court has not held gender to be a
suspect  classification.  C  is  incorrect  because  interference  with
fundamental rights is presumed to be unconstitutional. D is incorrect
for the same reason, and because state exercises of powers reserved
under 
the  Tenth  Amendment  must  be  consistent  with  other
requirements of the federal constitution.

48.  A  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits  states  from  engaging  in
invidious  discrimination.  In  A,  the  discriminatory  action  was  by  a
federal officer rather than by a state officer.

Convictions in B and C are likely since the clause has been held to
apply  to  municipal  as  well  as  state  action.  A  conviction  in  D  is
possible if it is found (and it has been in similar cases) that because
of its location in a state office building, and because of the fact that it
is rented from the state, the restaurant is so closely linked to the state
that the Equal Protection Clause should apply to its management.

49.  B  Statutory  language  that  does  not  allow  the  person  of  ordinary
intelligence to know what conduct is prohibited by the statute is vague
and  therefore  unconstitutional.  Language  such  as  that  given  here  has
frequently been held to be vague. Although it is not certain that a court
would  come  to  that  conclusion,  B  is  the  only  argument  that  could
possibly support the defendant's position.

Although  it  may  be  expressive,  conduct  like  the  defendant's  can  be
prohibited as part of “time, place, and manner” restrictions not aimed
at the content of the symbolic speech. A is therefore incorrect. C is
incorrect for two reasons: First, it may not be an accurate appraisal
of  the  reasonable  person's  response  to  the  defendant's  conduct,  and

191

second, the constitutionality of a statute depends on how the person of
ordinary  intelligence  would  understand  it  without  regard  to  any
particular conduct. If the language of a statute can be understood by
the  person  of  ordinary  intelligence,  it  is  not  vague  and  a  conviction
under  it  does  not  violate  due  process  for  the  sole  reason  that  the
statute has been newly enacted and not yet judicially construed. D is
therefore incorrect.

50. D  The  Supreme  Court  has  been  permissive  of  public  aid  to  religious
colleges  since  the  restraint  imposed  by  the  academic  disciplines  of
their instructors and the age of their students make it unlikely that they
are primarily devoted to religious indoctrination.

Almost all direct aid to primary and secondary schools operated by
religious  organizations  has  been  held  to  violate  the  Establishment
Clause.  A  and  B  are  incorrect  for  this  reason,  and  because
investigation  and  classification  of  the  teachers  and  curricula  of
schools  seeking  such  aid  would  necessarily  result  in  excessive
entanglement  of  the  state  with  religious  schools.  Although  the
Supreme  Court  has  approved  the  loan  of  textbooks  purchased  with
public  funds  to  students  at  religious  schools,  C  is  incorrect  since  it
would  involve  the  payment  of  public  money  directly  to  the  school,
and this, too, would probably result in excessive entanglement.

51. B Because problems of water pollution tend to vary from place to place,
it  is  generally  understood  that,  in  the  absence  of  congressional
mandates  to  the  contrary,  states  are  free  to  exercise  inconsistent
pollution controls in the interest of local health and safety.

A is incorrect because problems of pollution may differ, even though
the  water  is  used  for  the  same  purpose  in  various  states.  C  is
incorrect  because  if  Congress  has  enacted  laws  regulating  water
pollution in interstate rivers, inconsistent state regulations are likely
to be invalid under the Supremacy Clause. D is incorrect because the
intrastate nature of the company's business is not relevant to the effect
that the statute may have on interstate commerce.

52.  D  A  state  interference  with  the  free  exercise  of  a  religious  belief  is
constitutionally valid if it is necessary in light of a compelling state
interest.  Since  a  court  might  find  that  a  prohibition  of  the  kind  of
activity  described  by  the  statute  serves  a  compelling  interest  of  the
state, D is correct.

192

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  in
considering a challenge to the constitutionality of a state interference
with religion, the court may not consider the validity of the religious
beliefs in question.

53. A A case cannot be heard by a federal court unless it is ripe. A case is
not  ripe  if  it  has  not  become  sufficiently  concrete  to  be  easily
adjudicated.  If  a  court  believes  that  it  is  very  unlikely  that  a  statute
will be enforced, the court will likely treat the case as not being ripe.
This is so even if the plaintiff has admitted to violating the statute and
is likely to do so again.

D  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  case  is  moot  if  it  no  longer  involves  an
actual  controversy  because  events  occurring  after  the  filing  have
deprived  the  litigant  of  an  ongoing  stake  in  the  controversy  (for
example,  someone  suing  a  school  for  discriminatory  admissions
policies who is allowed to attend and manages to graduate before the
case  is  heard).  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  In  a  few  situations,  courts
will hear a case that is moot — for instance, if the issue is capable of
repetition, yet will likely continue to evade review. This is a situation
where,  if  the  case  was  declared  moot,  a  different  person  might  be
injured  in  the  same  way  by  the  same  defendant,  and  that  different
person's  claim  would  become  moot  before  review.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.

54. A The proper means of attacking an injunction is by judicial proceeding.
Because  of  the  short  time  period  involved,  however,  it  would  have
been impossible to obtain judicial review before the election. If the
organization desires to hold rallies in the future, there is a likelihood
that similarly issued injunctions will likewise evade review. Where a
problem is capable of repetition but likely to evade review — even
though, as here, the injunction being challenged is no longer in effect
— Supreme Court review is available.

B  is  incorrect  because  some  state  interference  with  the  right  to
assemble is permitted, as in the case of valid time, place, and manner
restrictions. C is incorrect because the possibility that similar future
claims will evade review prevents the question from being regarded
as  moot.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  is  not
relevant to anything but state action, and the organization is a private
organization.

193

55. A  If  the  Rebate  Act  was  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract,  and  if  the
plaintiff's  commencement  of  performance  can  be  regarded  as  an
acceptance  of  that  offer  (or  as  a  condition  that  prevents  its
withdrawal),  then  the  repeal  of  the  Act  may  be  found  to  impair  the
obligations of a contract. Although it is unlikely that the Act will be
found to constitute an offer, this is the only one of the arguments that
could possibly benefit the plaintiff.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth
Amendment applies only to federal action. There are two Privileges
and  Immunities  Clauses,  but  neither  is  applicable  here.  That  of
Article  IV  prohibits  discrimination  against  out-of-staters,  while  that
of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prevents  states  from  denying  persons
the  rights  conferred  by  United  States  citizenship.  C  is  therefore
incorrect. D is incorrect since the Just Compensation Clause requires
payment for private property that is taken for public use, and here no
private property was taken.

56.  D  It  has  been  held  that  the  First  Amendment  protects  the  right  of
nonprofit organizations who use litigation as an instrument of political
expression to solicit prospective clients.

A  is  incorrect  since  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  nondeceptive
advertising of legal services is protected by the First Amendment. B
is  incorrect  because  the  fact  that  the  advertisement  “could  have  the
effect” of inciting illegal conduct is not sufficient. For that argument
to  be  valid,  there  must  be  both  an  intention  that  the  expression  will
cause  illegal  conduct  and  an  imminent  probability  that  such  illegal
conduct  will  occur.  C  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  although
commercial speech is entitled to First Amendment protection, the fact
that speech is commercial does not in itself mean that laws regulating
it  are  invalid,  and  second,  the  communication  in  this  case  is  more
likely to be regarded as political expression rather than commercial
speech since it does not relate solely to economic interests.

57. D Since the results of litigation become part of the law, the requirement
of  standing  is  designed  to  assure  that  the  person  challenging  the
constitutionality of a statute has an incentive to litigate all issues fully
and vigorously. Ordinarily, this requires that the plaintiff show some
actual  or  imminent  concrete  personal  injury  that  would  be  remedied
or  prevented  if  his  or  her  claim  were  sustained.  The  building
contractor  in  D  stands  to  lose  the  economic  benefits  of  his  contract

194

with the state unless the section in question is invalidated.

A and C are incorrect because the damage apprehended is less direct
and  imminent  than  that  in  D.  B  is  incorrect  since  it  is  generally
understood  that  a  mere  political  or  intellectual  interest  does  not
satisfy the requirement of a personal injury.

58. C The Equal Protection Clause provides that “No state shall . . . deny to
any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” A
statute that invidiously discriminates against members of a particular
class  violates  its  requirements.  Although  some  questions  might  exist
as 
is
“invidious,” there is no need to make a determination because, of the
arguments listed, C is the only one with which the plaintiff stands any
chance at all.

the  statute's  discrimination  against  felons 

to  whether 

A  is  incorrect  because  the  statute  in  question  did  not  interfere  with
rights  under  a  preexisting  contract.  Since  the  statute  applies  only  to
persons convicted of felonies within the state, it does not discourage
the interstate travel of felons, so B is incorrect. D is little more than a
statement of moral philosophy and has no basis in constitutional law.

59.  D  Since  the  United  States  Constitution  gives  Congress  the  exclusive
power of legislation over the District of Columbia, there could be no
question about the validity of a federal law applicable only there.

Although  legalizing  gambling  would  probably  promote  certain
interstate economic activity, state concerns for public morals would
probably outweigh the federal interest in protecting such commerce.
This is especially true since all states prohibit or regulate gambling.
A  is  therefore  not  as  effective  an  argument  as  D.  The  Supremacy
Clause applies only where state legislation conflicts with federal law
enacted  within  the  scope  of  the  powers  delegated  to  Congress.
Whether a federal gambling law would be within the scope of these
powers presents a serious question. B is therefore not the best of the
four  arguments.  Since  there  is  no  general  federal  police  power,
Congress  lacks  the  power  to  substitute  scientific  opinion  (or
congressional  opinion)  for  that  of  the  state  regarding  the  public
morality. C is therefore incorrect.

60.  B  In  cases  of  economic  regulation,  the  proper  test  of  constitutional
validity is whether there was a rational basis for the law. This means
that  if  any  situation  can  be  imagined  in  which  the  law  would  be  a

195

reasonable way of accomplishing a legitimate purpose, it is valid.

A  is  incorrect  since  the  “compelling  state  interest”  standard  is
ordinarily  applied  only  in  cases  involving  interference  with  a
“suspect classification” or a “fundamental right.” C is incorrect since
the  distribution  of  any  entitlements,  whether  they  are  classified  as
“privileges” or “rights,” must be consistent with the requirements of
the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  “clear  and
present danger” test has been applied only to interference with First
Amendment rights.

61.  D  It  has  been  held  that  significant  state  involvement  in  a  particular
private activity might make the Equal Protection Clause applicable to
the  private  activity.  It  is  possible  that  the  state's  licensing,  funding,
inspection, and oversight of the hospital operation would be sufficient
to have this effect. While it is not certain that a court would come to
that  conclusion,  the  argument  in  D  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could
possibly support the position of the organization.

A is incorrect because the Fourteenth Amendment relates only to state
action or to private action in which the state is significantly involved.
B  is  incorrect  because  cases  have  held  that  licensing  alone  is  not
sufficient  state  involvement.  Although  the  Equal  Protection  Clause
prevents  state  courts  from  enforcing  private  policies  of  racial
discrimination, it does not require state courts to eliminate privately
practiced discrimination. C is therefore incorrect.

62. C A statute that makes the possession or sale of obscene material by a
bookseller  a  crime  without  imposing  any  requirement  of  scienter  is
unconstitutional  because  it  is  likely  to  have  a  chilling  effect  on
booksellers, who probably cannot familiarize themselves with all the
books that they sell.

Statutes  like  that  described  in  A  have  been  declared  valid  on  the
ground that they are justified by a municipality's interest in land-use
planning. Although the United States Supreme Court has held that no
person may be punished for private possession of materials judged to
be obscene unless they involve child pornography, showing films for
a  fee  is  not  private  possession,  even  when  done  in  the  home.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  Court  has  held  that
evidence  of  pandering  may  be  relevant  to  the  questions  of  whether
material alleged to be obscene appeals primarily to prurient interest

196

and  whether  it  lacks  serious  value,  two  elements  of  the  Supreme
Court's definition of obscenity.

63.  D  Since  the  First  Amendment  provides  that  “Congress  shall  make  no
law  .  .  .  abridging  the  freedom  of  .  .  .  the  press,”  a  statute  that
prohibits certain publications probably violates it.

A is not the strongest argument since the President's power to make
executive  agreements  is  broad  and  may  cover  any  area  of
international concern. B is incorrect because there is no constitutional
requirement that an executive agreement must be implemented in the
least  burdensome  manner  possible.  The  executive  agreement  simply
calls  for  the  government  of  each  country  to  “discourage”  the  press
from  making  certain  statements.  Since  this  can  be  accomplished
without violating the First Amendment, C is not a correct statement.

64. D In some cases where a public employee's expressive activities lead to
dismissal,  the  employee  will  be  protected  by  his  or  her  First
Amendment rights and reinstated to his or her position. Here, because
the police officer's activities did not involve political news or public
information about the police department's functioning, his expression
was  not  a  matter  of  public  concern  worthy  of  First  Amendment
protection. Importantly, the officer's speech purposefully exploited the
police department and likely harmed its missions and functions. A is
therefore  incorrect.  Freedom  of  association  is  not  specifically
mentioned  in  the  First  Amendment,  but  is  derived  from  individuals'
rights  of  speech  and  assembly.  Freedom  of  association  refers  to  the
idea  that  if  an  individual  has  a  First  Amendment  right  to  engage  in
particular  expressive  activities,  a  group  has  the  freedom  of
association to engage in that same activity. Here, as stated above, the
officer's  expressive  conduct  did  not  rise  to  the  level  of  conduct  that
would  cause  the  First  Amendment  to  protect  him  in  his  job.
Consequently, B and C are therefore incorrect.

65. C Since the President has broad authority as the chief spokesperson for
the United States in the area of foreign affairs, delegations of authority
by  the  President  in  this  field  are  constitutionally  valid.  On  the  other
hand, the President's broad powers to delegate authority in this area
make  interference  by  Congress  with  such  delegations  a  violation  of
the principle of separation of powers.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  United  States  Constitution  specifically

197

gives  Congress  the  power  to  exercise  some  control  over  foreign
affairs  (e.g.,  the  senatorial  power  to  “advise  and  consent”  in  the
execution  of  treaties),  thus  preventing  the  President's  power  in  this
area  from  being  truly  “sole”  or  “exclusive.”  B  is  incorrect  because
the  Constitution  gives  the  Senate,  not  the  House  of  Representatives,
power  over  foreign  affairs.  Likewise,  D  is  incorrect  since  any
presidential veto can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of Congress.

66. D A case presents a non-justiciable political question when a decision
would  unduly  interfere  with  the  operation  of  a  co-equal  branch  of
government. Article I of the United States Constitution provides that
each house of Congress “shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns,
and  Qualifications  of  its  own  members.”  Since  the  order  that  the
plaintiff  seeks  would  interfere  with  this  power  of  the  Senate,  her
petition might be said to present a non-justiciable political question.

Collateral estoppel prevents the re-litigation of an issue identical to
one that has already been judicially determined. There is some doubt
about  whether  the  doctrine  would  apply  to  determinations  by  non-
judicial  bodies  (such  as  the  Senate).  In  any  event,  A  is  incorrect
because if the doctrine were applied, it would aid the plaintiff's case
rather  than  lead  to  its  dismissal  since  the  issue  of  her  age  was
determined  in  her  favor.  Since  the  qualifications  of  a  United  States
Senator  are  established  by  the  United  States  Constitution,  any
question  about  whether  a  person  is  qualified  to  be  a  United  States
Senator  is  a  federal  one.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  fact  that  the
plaintiff has already had her day in court might lead to a dismissal of
her  claim  if  the  state  court's  decision  had  been  unfavorable  to  her.
Since it found in her favor, however, its decision should not justify a
dismissal of her case. C is therefore incorrect.

67. A Article I, Section 8, clause 4 gives Congress the power to “establish
an  uniform  Rule  of  Naturalization.”  This  has  been  held  to  grant
Congress plenary power over aliens that includes the power to treat
non-citizens  differently  from  citizens  so  long  as  the  discrimination
bears  some  rational  relationship  to  national  policy.  Since  the

naturalization,  it  is  probably  justified  by  the  plenary  power  of
Congress over aliens.

in  question  could  have 

B and D are incorrect because resident aliens are entitled to many of
but  not  all  the  protections  guaranteed  by  the  United  States

198

Constitution. Since the Equal Protection Clause applies only to action
by the states and is inapplicable to federal action, C is incorrect.

68.  A  The  Fifth  Amendment  “Taking”  Clause  states  that  private  property
cannot  be 
just  compensation.
taken  for  public  use  without 
Consequently,  while  the  government  may  take  private  property  in
certain circumstances, it must pay a fair price for it. Importantly, if the
government  makes  or  authorizes  a  permanent  physical  occupation  of
private property, this action automatically results in a taking no matter
how  minor  the  interference  with  the  owner's  use  and  no  matter  how
important the government interest. C and D are therefore incorrect. B
is  incorrect  because  the  landlord's  religious  beliefs  do  not  become
part of the takings analysis.

69. D  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prevents  the
states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without
due process of law. Since the Clean Roads Act made violation of an
administrative  order  a  crime,  it  violated  Fourteenth  Amendment  due
process  by  permitting  the  order  to  be  issued  without  giving  the
defendant an opportunity to be heard.

An ex post facto law is one that punishes as criminal an act that was
not prohibited when it was performed. The Clean Roads Act was not
an ex post facto law because it did not impose punishment for an act
that had already been committed. Instead, it permitted the issuance of
an  administrative  order,  the  future  violation  of  which  would  be  a
crime.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  bill  of  attainder  is  a  law  that
punishes  a  person  without  the  benefit  of  a  judicial  trial.  Since  the
defendant's conviction was the result of a trial, the Clean Roads Act
cannot be called a bill of attainder, making B incorrect. C is incorrect
because the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies only
to the federal government and has no application to the states.

70. C The United States Supreme Court has held that state aid to religious
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
schools  is  constitutionally  valid  if  it  has  a  secular  purpose,  a
primarily  secular  effect,  does  not  result  in  undue  entanglement
between  state  and  religion,  and  does  not  produce  political
divisiveness  along  religious  lines.  Since  the  examinations  are
designed to test competence in secular subjects and are to be given in
all  high  schools,  their  administration  in  religious  schools  by  state
employees  is  not  likely  to  result  in  entanglement  or  political
divisiveness. Therefore, if the law has a purpose and effect that are

199

primarily secular, it does not violate the Establishment Clause.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  courts  have  generally  held  that  a  state
taxpayer has standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute that
will  directly  result  in  an  expenditure  of  state  funds.  B  is  incorrect
because even a law that does not discriminate between religions may
be found to violate the Establishment Clause if it serves to advance
religion in general. If a law violates any of the four prongs of the test
outlined  above,  the  fact  that  it  was  enacted  to  serve  a  compelling
state interest does not prevent it from being unconstitutional under the
Establishment Clause. D is therefore incorrect.

71. B The defendant advocated an act of arson; the fact that the crowd —
carrying  flaming  torches  —  began  following  him  toward  the  clinic
indicates  that  unlawful  conduct  was  immediately  probable.  Speech
that advocates illegal conduct may be constitutionally prohibited if it
advocates action and involves incitement of immediate and probably
unlawful  conduct.  The  defendant's  conduct  may,  therefore,  be
constitutionally  prohibited.  A  law  that  requires  a  permit  for  the
conduct  of  a  public  assembly  but  provides  vague  standards  for  the
granting  of  such  a  permit  violates  the  First  Amendment,  however.
Since  this  ordinance  granted  the  mayor  unfettered  discretion  in
granting permits, it was unconstitutional.

A is incorrect because speech that advocates unlawful action and is
probable  to  immediately  incite  such  unlawful  action  may  be  subject
to  prior  restraint  that  is  constitutionally  permissible.  Although  the
defendant probably did not have a constitutional right to engage in the
conduct  described,  the  requirement  of  standing  is  relaxed  in  a
constitutional  challenge  based  on  vagueness  or  overbreadth.  Thus,
even though the defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by
the  ordinance,  he  has  standing  to  challenge  it  on  the  ground  that  its
vagueness  or  overbreadth  might  result  in  a  violation  of  the
constitutional rights of others. C is therefore incorrect. D is incorrect
because  it  is  over-inclusive.  Some  permit  requirements  (like  those
that  regulate 
time,  place,  and  manner  of  speech)  are
constitutionally valid. Others (like this one, which is based on vague
standards) are constitutionally invalid.

the 

72. A Although the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution gives
Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, it is understood
that the states may exercise some regulation as well. If, however, the

200

interstate  activity  in  question  is  of  national  concern  and  requires
uniform  federal  regulation,  then  the  states  may  not  regulate  it  in  the
absence  of  a  federal  statute  specifically  authorizing  them  to  do  so.
Since  this  question  calls  for  the  assumption  that  there  is  no  such
federal  statute,  the  state's  attempt  to  regulate  the  interstate  sale  of
petroleum produced within the state would be unconstitutional if that
activity  is  of  a  national  concern  and  requires  uniform  federal
regulation.

Whether an imported product remains in its original package may be
relevant to determining a state's right to tax it under Article I, Section
10(2), which prohibits the states from taxing imports or exports. B is
incorrect,  however,  because  the  “original  package  doctrine”  has
never  been  relevant  to  determining  whether  a  state  may  regulate  a
particular activity. Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, a state is
required  to  enforce  judgments  and  decrees  of  the  courts  of  other
states. Since the facts in this case do not involve an attempt to enforce
the judgment or decree of the court of another state, the Full Faith and
Credit  Clause  is  inapplicable,  and  C  is  incorrect.  Under  the
Supremacy Clause, a state law is invalid if it conflicts with a federal
law dealing with the same subject matter. In such cases, the field is
said  to  be  “preempted”  by  the  existence  of  a  federal  statute  dealing
with the same subject matter. Here, since there is no federal statute,
there  has  been  no  “preemption,”  and  the  Supremacy  Clause  is
inapplicable. D is therefore incorrect.

73.  D  Because  the  determination  of  any  constitutional  issue  is  likely  to
become an important part of U.S. law, the requirement of standing is
designed  to  assure  that  persons  litigating  constitutional  issues  have
incentive to litigate them vigorously and effectively. For this reason,
standing requires that a party seeking to assert a constitutional issue
must have a personal stake in the outcome. Usually, this takes the form
of an actual or immediately threatened concrete injury that would be
prevented  by  a  favorable  determination  of  the  claim.  Since  the
construction company in D  will  lose  profits  if  the  state  is  unable  to
honor  its  contract,  it  has  the  necessary  personal  stake  to  confer
standing.

Although  a  state  taxpayer  may  have  standing  to  challenge  the
constitutionality of an outlay of state funds, A is incorrect because the
challenge in this case is to a federal statute, not to the expenditure of

201

state  funds.  The  relationship  between  a  federal  taxpayer  and  the
federal  treasury  is  regarded  as  too  indirect  to  confer  standing  on  a
federal taxpayer seeking to challenge an outlay of federal funds. B is
therefore incorrect. An interest that is purely intellectual or political
is generally not held to be sufficiently “personal” to confer standing,
making C incorrect.

74.  D  The  primary  purpose  of  the  exclusionary  rule  is  to  deter  police
misconduct  in  gathering  evidence.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court
has held, however, that after a person has had a full and fair hearing
in  a  state  court  on  his  or  her  claim  that  evidence  against  him  or  her
was seized illegally, additional review by the federal court would be
of  minimal  use  in  deterring  police  misconduct.  For  this  reason,  in  a
habeas  corpus  proceeding,  the  federal  court  is  bound  by  the  state
court's finding regarding a claimed Fourth Amendment violation.

A is therefore incorrect. Although a habeas corpus petition based on
an asserted violation of the United States Constitution can be heard in
a  federal  court  only  after  all  state  court  remedies  have  been
exhausted,  the  exhaustion  of  state  remedies  alone  is  not  sufficient
reason  for  the  federal  court  to  grant  the  petition.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. C is incorrect because a denial of certiorari by the United
States  Supreme  Court  indicates  only  that  fewer  than  four  judges
wanted to hear the claim. It does not reflect any finding on the merits
by the United States Supreme Court, and it does not affect the power
of any other court — state or federal — to hear the claim.

75. A  The  abstention  doctrine  prevents  federal  trial  courts  from  deciding
constitutional issues that are premised on unsettled questions of state
law.  Since  the  constitutionality  of  the  state  statute  would  likely
depend  on  the  meaning  of  the  term  “sexual  deviates,”  and  since  the
facts  say  that  the  state  courts  have  never  interpreted  that  term,  the
United  States  District  Court  should  refrain  from  considering  the
validity  of  the  statute  until  the  state  court  has  had  an  opportunity  to
determine the meaning of the term.

Although  the  Eleventh  Amendment  prevents  federal  courts  from
entertaining damage claims against a state by its citizens or by those
of  another  state,  it  does  not  prevent  those  courts  from  issuing  an
injunction  ordering  a  state  official  not  to  violate  federal  law
(including the United States Constitution). B is therefore incorrect. A
question is said to be moot if there is no longer an issue the judicial

202

determination  of  which  would  affect  the  rights  of  the  parties.  Since
the rejection of the plaintiff's application was based on the state law
described, an order enjoining the state from enforcing it could result
in the hiring of the plaintiff. The question is therefore not moot, so C
is incorrect. A person has standing to assert a constitutional claim if a
judicial determination would prevent a concrete and direct injury to
him  or  her.  Since  a  favorable  decision  could  result  in  the  plaintiff's
being hired, he does have standing. D is therefore incorrect.

76.  A  A  statutory  system  of  classification  is  unconstitutional  if  it  lacks  a
rational basis. Whether or not this statutory requirement has a rational
basis is uncertain, but of the arguments listed, A is the only one with
any possibility of success.

While the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires a state to honor the
judgments  of  the  courts  of  other  states,  it  has  never  been  held  to
require that states honor professional licenses issued by other states.
B is therefore incorrect. Since biology may be studied anywhere, and
since  the  statute  makes  the  study  of  biology  a  requirement  for  all
persons  —  state  residents  and  non-residents  alike  —  there  is  no
indication  that  the  statute  discriminates  against  out-of-staters.  C  is
therefore  incorrect.  The  Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the
Fourteenth Amendment prevents states from interfering with the rights
that  flow  from  the  relationship  between  a  United  States  citizen  and
the  federal  government.  Since  the  right  to  be  a  hairdresser  does  not
arise from that relationship, D is incorrect.

77. B Material is obscene if it appeals primarily to prurient interest, depicts
sexual  activity  in  a  way  that  offends  contemporary  community
standards, and, on the whole, is lacking in serious artistic or scientific
value.  Although  a  “pandering”  advertisement  used  to  sell  allegedly
obscene  material  might  not  itself  be  obscene,  the  United  States
Supreme Court has held that its contents may be admitted as evidence
relevant  to  a  determination  of  whether  the  material  so  advertised
appeals  primarily  to  prurient  interest  and  whether  it  is  lacking  in
serious value.

The  defendant  has  not  been  charged  with  publishing  an  obscene
advertisement,  so  it  does  not  matter  whether  the  advertisement  is
constitutionally  protected.  Its  admissibility  depends  not  on  whether
the advertisement can be constitutionally punished, but on whether it
is  relevant  to  a  material  issue  in  the  case.  A  and  C  are  therefore

203

incorrect. D is incorrect because, even though not itself obscene, the
advertisement  may  be  relevant  to  determining  whether  the  film  is
obscene.

78.  B  Although  many  presidential  appointments  are  subject  to  the  advice
and  consent  of  the  Senate,  it  has  been  held  that  the  president  may
remove appointees at will so long as they do not perform judicial or
quasi-judicial  functions.  Since  ambassadors  perform  functions  that
are strictly executive, the President may remove them at will.

A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

79. C Under the Fifth Amendment “Takings” Clause, the government cannot
take property without fair compensation. Importantly, private property
can  only  be  taken  for  a  public  use.  Consequently,  the  government
cannot  simply  take  private  property  and  hand  it  to  another  private
owner without some sort of public use. However, the property does
not have to be generally open to the public after a taking, and it can be
given over to a private party so long as the public can be expected to
receive  some  benefit  from  its  use.  Here,  since  the  houses  were
condemned  as  part  of  an  economic  development  plan  benefiting  the
public,  the  condemnation  was  a  legal  taking  even  though  a  private
party was developing the property.

A and B  are  therefore  incorrect.  In  some  circumstances,  a  land  use
regulation can result in a taking. D is therefore incorrect.

80.  A  Because  the  determination  of  any  constitutional  issue  is  likely  to
become  an  important  part  of  United  States  law,  the  requirement  of
standing  is  designed  to  assure  that  persons  litigating  constitutional
issues have incentive to litigate them vigorously and effectively. For
this  reason,  standing  requires  that  a  party  seeking  to  assert  a
constitutional  issue  must  have  a  personal  stake  in  the  outcome.
Usually,  this  takes  the  form  of  an  actual  or  immediately  threatened
concrete injury that would be prevented by a favorable determination
of the claim. Since the girl has not yet consented to marry the boy, the
state law does not injure or imminently threaten to injure him.

B is incorrect because marriage is a fundamental right, and a statute
that interferes with a fundamental right is valid only if it is necessary
to serve a compelling state interest. Unless males under the age of 19
are not sufficiently mature for marriage and females over the age of
17  are  sufficiently  mature  for  marriage,  the  fact  that  females  mature

204

earlier than males — even if accurate — is irrelevant. C is therefore
incorrect. D is incorrect because the exercise of a power reserved to
the  state  —  even  a  reserved  power  under  the  Tenth  Amendment  —
must be consistent with the United States Constitution.

81. D A claim is moot when there are no unresolved questions for the court
to  determine.  Since  the  injunction  that  the  plaintiff  seeks  has  been
made  unnecessary  by  the  change  in  University  policy,  there  is  no
longer a need for judicial determination. D is therefore correct.

Federal courts lack the power to interpret state constitutions. For this
reason, a federal court may not review a state court decision that is
based on an interpretation of the state constitution (i.e., based on an
adequate  state  ground).  This  principle  does  not  prevent  a  federal
court  from  hearing  a  challenge  to  state  action,  however,  if  that
challenge  is  based  on  the  United  States  Constitution.  Since  the
plaintiff's  federal  court  proceeding  asserts  that  the  United  States
Constitution  prohibits  the  Chancellor's  act,  the  existence  or  absence
of an adequate state ground for the Chancellor's act is irrelevant. A is
therefore  incorrect.  A  court  may  hear  a  claim  even  though  it  has
become moot if the nature of it is such that the question may come up
again and that it is likely to evade judicial review. (For example, the
constitutionality of a statute preventing the abortion of a child could
not  possibly  be  determined  by  the  United  States  Supreme  Court
before  the  birth  of  the  child.)  B  is  incorrect,  however,  because,  in
view of the change in University policy, there is no reason to believe
that  the  claim  will  come  up  again.  Since  the  Eleventh  Amendment
prevents  federal  courts  from  hearing  damage  claims  against  a  state,
the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  had  been  damaged  by  past  denials  of  her
application would not give the court a reason to hear the claim that is
otherwise moot. C is therefore incorrect.

82. A The spending power authorizes Congress to expend funds to promote
the  general  welfare.  Since  the  museum  was  intended  to  serve  all
residents of the United States, the congressional decision to establish
and fund it is probably justified under the spending power.

The Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to regulate the interstate
movement  of  people  or  commodities.  Although  the  museum  is  to
serve  Americans  from  all  states,  the  statute  makes  no  attempt  to
regulate their movement or that of the artifacts to be displayed. B is
therefore incorrect. The Eleventh Amendment prevents federal courts

205

from  hearing  claims  against  a  state.  Since  this  claim  is  against  the
United States, and not against any individual state, C is incorrect. The
doctrine of state immunity relieves states of the obligations imposed
by certain federal laws. D is incorrect because the statute in question
imposes no obligations on a state.

83. B  Article  IV  provides,  in  part,  that  Congress  shall  have  the  power  to
make all needful rules and regulations respecting property belonging
to  the  United  States.  This  has  been  construed  to  mean  that  Congress
— or an agency authorized by Congress — may exercise power over
federal lands substantially, without limitation.

The  Commerce  Clause  is  inapplicable  here  because  there  is  no
indication  that  the  national  preserve  is  involved  in  interstate
commerce  or  movement.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect
because,  although  Congress  is  empowered  to  spend  for  the  general
welfare,  there  is  no  general  federal  police  power.  The  power  of
eminent  domain  permits  the  government  to  take  private  property  for
public  use  (subject  to  the  Fifth  Amendment  requirement  of  “just
compensation”). Since there has been no taking of private property, D
is incorrect.

84. C The Contract Clause (Article I, Sec. 10) provides that no state shall
pass  any  law  impairing  the  obligation  of  contracts.  The  Clause
applies both to federal and state governments. While state attempts to
rewrite public contracts are subject to strict scrutiny, judicial review
is  not  so  stringent  for  private  contracts.  Consequently,  if  a  state  is
acting  reasonably  in  pursuit  of  a  legitimate  public  purpose,  “mere
rationality”  review  applies  and  even  substantial  modifications  to
private contracts will be allowed. Here, the court has found that the
state's  action  to  save  its  economy  is  reasonable  and  in  pursuit  of  a
legitimate public purpose, so the legislation will be upheld.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

85. C An issue presents a non-justiciable political question when a decision
would  unduly  interfere  with  the  exercise  of  powers  vested  by  the
Constitution in other co-equal branches of government. Although it is
by no means certain that this is such an issue, C is the only one of the
arguments listed that has any possibility of success.

It is not clear how a federal court could go about enforcing process
against the President if he or she refused to obey a judicial order, but

206

it is generally understood — and was so held in U.S. v. Nixon, 418
U.S. 683 (1974) — that the federal courts have jurisdiction over the
President. A is therefore incorrect. B  is  incorrect  because,  although
the President is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, his or her
power  as  such  is  subject  to  limitations  imposed  by  Congress.  The
United States Constitution gives Congress — not the President — the
power to declare war. Thus, if the presidential order sending troops
to the republic was a declaration of war, it would be constitutionally
invalid. D is therefore incorrect.

86. A Procedural due process requires, among other things, a jury trial on
issues  of  fact.  For  this  reason,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  has
held  that  an  arbitrary  statutory  presumption  violates  procedural  due
process by depriving the defendant of his or her right to a jury trial on
the 
irrebuttable
involved.  The  state  statute  creates  an 
presumption that persons who spent more than three hours together in
a  hotel  room  had  sexual  intercourse.  If  that  presumption  is  an
arbitrary one, it violates the requirements of procedural due process.

issue 

Substantive due process requirements are said to be violated when a
statute  interferes  with  certain  constitutionally  protected  individual
freedoms. This statute forbids sexual intercourse with persons under
the  age  of  16  years.  Since  there  is  clearly  no  constitutionally
protected right to engage in sexual intercourse with such persons, B is
incorrect. The Equal Protection Clause is violated by a state law that
invidiously  discriminates.  Since  statutes  designed  to  protect  young
people against their own lack of mature judgment — particularly with
respect to sexual intercourse — have been held not to be invidious, C
is  incorrect.  A  bill  of  attainder  is  a  law  that  has  the  effect  of
punishing  specific  individuals  without  benefit  of  a  trial.  When  the
law  in  question  does  not  name  the  specific  individuals  to  be
punished, it is a bill of attainder if it mandates a punishment based on
preexisting  and  unalterable  characteristics.  Since  the  state  statute
does  not  impose  punishment  without  a  trial,  it  is  not  a  bill  of
attainder. D is therefore incorrect.

87.  B  The  Fifth  Amendment  provides  in  part  that  no  person  shall  be
deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Due
process includes the right to a fair trial. Since it is possible to argue
that  the  systematic  exclusion  of  aliens  from  the  jury  denied  the
defendant a fair trial, it is possible that the federal statute excluding

207

aliens from juries violated his due process rights. It is, of course, far
from certain that a court would come to this conclusion, but of all the
arguments listed, that set forth in B is the only one that could possibly
lead to a reversal of the defendant's conviction.

A is incorrect because the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment  prohibits  discrimination  only  by  the  state  and  cannot,
therefore,  be  the  basis  of  a  decision  that  a  federal  law  is
unconstitutional.  The  doctrine  of  separation  of  powers  requires  that
the  duties  of  the  federal  government  be  divided  among  the  three
branches  created  by  the  United  States  Constitution  (i.e.,  executive,
legislative, and judicial). It is not applicable here because there is no
claim  that  Congress  interfered  with  any  other  branch  of  the  federal
government by passing the law in question. C is therefore incorrect.
Under the Supremacy Clause, when a state law is inconsistent with a
valid  federal  law,  the  state  law  is  invalid.  For  this  reason,  it  could
not support a conclusion that a federal statute was unconstitutional. D
is therefore incorrect.

88. D The Equal Protection Clause prohibits invidious discrimination by the
state. Since not all discrimination is invidious, a series of standards
have  been  developed  to  determine  whether  a  particular  form  of
discrimination  is  constitutionally  valid.  If  a  discriminatory  purpose
(i.e., a desire to exclude black women between the ages of 18 and 23
from county court juries) was a motivating factor in enacting the law,
or if the law is deliberately applied for that purpose, it is necessary to
turn  to  the  standards  mentioned  above.  If,  however,  a  law  is  neutral
on  its  face  and  is  not  purposely  applied  in  a  discriminatory  way,  it
does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, even though it may have
a discriminatory effect. Thus, the fact that a law has a discriminatory
effect  is  not  sufficient  to  result  in  its  invalidity  under  the  Equal
Protection  Clause  unless  it  is  shown  that  the  law  had  been  or  was
applied  with  a  discriminatory  purpose.  The  fact  that  the  law
effectively  excluded  a  particular  group  may  be  circumstantial
evidence that it was intended — either on its face or in its application
— to have that effect.

A and B are therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because the fact that
an otherwise neutral law had a discriminatory effect is not enough to
make it invalid unless there was a discriminatory purpose.

89. C Article IV, Section 3 of the United States Constitution provides in part

208

that  Congress  shall  have  the  power  “to  dispose  of  .  .  .  property
belonging  to  the  United  States.”  Since  the  battleships  are  property
belonging to the United States, Congress has the power to dispose of
them under this constitutional provision.

A is incorrect because the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment prohibits certain discrimination by the states, but it is not
applicable  to  the  federal  government.  A  bill  of  attainder  is  a
legislative  act  punishing  an  individual  or  a  group  of  individuals
without  a  judicial  trial.  Since  the  sale  of  battleships  did  not  punish
anyone,  it  could  not  be  a  bill  of  attainder.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.
Although Congress has the power to spend for the general welfare, it
is generally understood that there is no general federal police power.
D is therefore incorrect.

90. B Under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, a state
law is invalid if it conflicts with a valid federal law dealing with the
same subject matter. This principle is frequently used to support the
conclusion that a state attempt to regulate the federal government or a
federal  activity  is  invalid.  A  state  is  free  to  regulate  federal
contractors,  however,  so  long  as  such  regulations  do  not  interfere
with  federal  purposes  or  policies.  If  the  state  pollution  law  were
likely  to  have  the  effect  of  increasing  the  cost  of  producing  bomb
sights for the Department of Defense, it could successfully be argued
that it is invalid under the Supremacy Clause. If, on the other hand, the
state  pollution  law  would  not  significantly  increase  the  costs  of  the
bombsights,  it  would  probably  not  interfere  with  any  federal  policy
and would therefore be valid.

If Winding River is located entirely within the state, it might not be
subject  to  valid  congressional  regulation  under  the  Commerce
Clause. A is incorrect, however, because Congress has other powers
that  might  justify  federal  regulation  concerning  Winding  River.
Congress  may  exempt  federal  contractors  from  compliance  with  a
state  regulation  on  the  ground  that  the  regulation  unduly  interferes
with a federal activity. Since Congress may create such an exemption
impliedly, however, the fact that it has not expressly done so would
not be conclusive. C is therefore incorrect. The question of whether a
river  is  “navigable”  is  relevant  in  determining  whether  the  federal
courts  have  admiralty  jurisdiction  over  it.  D  is  incorrect,  however,
because  congressional  power  to  regulate  activities  on  the  banks  of

209

Winding  River  may  come  from  other  sources  (e.g.,  the  power  to
provide for the common defense).

91.  C  When  an  issue  appears  to  be  moot  as  the  result  of  the  voluntary
conduct  of  the  party  moving  for  dismissal,  the  party  must  show  that
there  is  no  reasonable  expectation  that  the  wrong  will  be  repeated.
Otherwise,  parties  could  avoid  litigation  simply  by  temporarily
changing their actions and then repeating their prior actions as soon as
the  case  was  dismissed.  Since  the  National  Park  Service  has  not
shown that the wrong will not be repeated, C is the best answer.

A  claim  is  moot  when  there  are  no  longer  any  contested  questions
essential  for  the  disposition  of  the  controversy.  However,  A  is
incorrect  because,  as  stated  above,  there  is  no  indication  that  the
National Park Service will not cut tree prices in the future. Although
Congress does have the power to dispose of property belonging to the
United States under Article IV, this power has no relation to whether
a claim is moot or not. Consequently, since the question specifically
states the National Park Service is moving to dismiss on the ground
that the issue is moot, both B and D are incorrect.

92. B  The  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  provides  in
part  that  no  person  shall  be  deprived  of  life,  liberty,  or  property
without  due  process  of  law.  Although  “due  process”  is  an  elusive
term,  it  is  generally  held  to  include  the  right  of  appeal.  For  this
reason,  the  provision  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Court  Act  that
provides that there shall be no right of appeal probably violates the
Due Process Clause.

Article  III  of  the  United  States  Constitution  provides  that  federal
judges  shall  hold  their  offices  during  good  behavior.  This  has  been
held  to  mean  that  so  long  as  a  judge  does  not  act  improperly,  he  or
she may not be removed from office during his or her lifetime. This
does not mean that the office itself may not be abolished, however. A
is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because Article III of the United
States  Constitution  specifically  empowers  Congress  to  ordain  and
establish federal courts inferior to the United States Supreme Court.
Although  the  United  States  Constitution  vests  the  judicial  power  of
the United States in the United States Supreme Court, it provides that
the  Court's  appellate  jurisdiction  is  subject  to  such  exceptions  as
Congress shall make. D is therefore incorrect.

210

93.  B  Under  the  Supremacy  Clause  of  Article  VI  of  the  United  States
Constitution,  the  statutes  and  treaties  of  the  United  States  are  the
supreme  law  of  the  land.  This  means  that  a  state  law  that  is
inconsistent with any valid federal law or treaty is invalid. Although
an  executive  agreement  is  not  a  treaty,  it  has  the  same  effect  as  a
federal law under the Supremacy Clause. Since the application of the
state income tax law is inconsistent with the executive agreement that
prohibits  the  taxation  of  Ruritanian  corporations  within  the  United
States,  the  Supremacy  Clause  may  make  the  state  law  invalid  as
applied to the plaintiff.

Although  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  the  states  from
taxing  imports  or  exports  without  congressional  consent,  A  is
incorrect  because  the  state  income  tax  is  not  a  tax  on  imports  or
exports. The Necessary and Proper Clause gives Congress the power
to  do  whatever  is  necessary  and  proper  in  carrying  out  its  other
powers.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  constitutionality  of  an  act  of
Congress is not in question. It has been said that states are prevented
from taxing the federal government because “the power to tax is the
power  to  destroy.”  This  argument  is  not  applicable  in  this  case
because the state is making no attempt to tax the federal government.
D is therefore incorrect.

94. B A federal court may refuse to hear a case because it presents a “non-
justiciable  political  question.”  An  issue  is  non-justiciable  if  a
decision  would  unduly  interfere  with  the  exercise  of  powers  vested
by  the  Constitution  in  a  co-equal  branch  of  government,  or  if  it
involves a matter that the text of the Constitution commits to one of the
other branches of government. Since this concept is designed to keep
the judiciary from interfering with the activities of the executive and
legislative  branches  of  government,  it  derives  from  the  doctrine  of
separation  of  powers.  Since  the  United  States  Constitution  provides
that cases of impeachment shall be tried by the Senate, the doctrine of
separation  of  powers  could  result  in  the  court's  refusal  to  hear  the
judge's challenge.

in  criminal
The  Sixth  Amendment  provides 
proceedings shall enjoy the right to counsel. A is incorrect, however,
because the Due Process Clause protects the right to counsel at other
proceedings as well. The abstention doctrine prevents a federal court
from  considering  a  constitutional  question  based  on  an  unsettled

that  defendants 

211

question  of  state  law.  Since  the  judge's  right  to  counsel  at  an
impeachment  proceeding  does  not  depend  on  state  law,  C  is
incorrect.  Article  II,  Section  3  of  the  United  States  Constitution
provides  that  a  judgment  of  impeachment  cannot  extend  beyond
removal  and  disqualification  from  office.  Federal  employment  may
be a “property” interest, however, to which the Due Process Clause
applies. Thus, the fact that the impeachment proceeding results in no
more  than  loss  of  a  job  is  not  sufficient  to  prevent  the  Due  Process
Clause from requiring the right to counsel.

95. A If a law requiring a permit for the exercise of First Amendment rights
is  invalid  on  its  face,  its  constitutionality  may  be  attacked  as  a
defense against a charge of violating it. If, on the other hand, the law
is invalid as applied, the unconstitutionality of its application may not
be  raised  as  a  defense  against  a  charge  of  violating  it.  Instead,  the
appropriate  course  is  to  apply  for  a  permit  and  then  seek  judicial
review  of  the  denial  of  the  application,  unless  there  is  no  time  for
such judicial review. Since the law was already held to be valid on
its face, and since the only claim made by the defendant is that the law
was  unconstitutionally  applied,  this  claim  may  not  be  raised  by  the
defendant  as  a  defense  unless  two  months  would  not  have  been
sufficient  time  to  obtain  judicial  review.  The  facts  do  not  disclose
whether this is so, but the argument set forth in A is the only one listed
that could possibly be an effective response to the defendant's claim.

Although the constitutionality of the ordinance on its face has already
been  decided  by  a  federal  court  (and  is  therefore  res judicata),  the
defendant's  claim  is  that  the  ordinance  is  being  applied  in  an
unconstitutional manner. Since even a valid ordinance may be applied
in  an  invalid  way,  B  is  incorrect.  To  promote  the  public  order  or
other  public  good,  a  law  may  impose  time,  place,  and  manner
restrictions  on  expressive  conduct  so  long  as  these  restrictions  are
not  based  on  the  message  content  of  the  expression.  Since  the
ordinance was found to be constitutional on its face, it probably did
constitute  a  valid  time,  place,  and  manner  restriction.  Like  B,
however, C is incorrect because the application of the ordinance is
being  challenged.  Although  laws  may  regulate  expressive  conduct
even  in  traditional  public  forums,  D  is  not  a  good  response  to  the
defendant's  claim  because  not  all  such  regulations  are  valid.  (Note:
Actually,  regulations  applicable  to  traditional  public  forums  must
face a stricter test than other such regulations.)

212

96. A  The  Constitution  gives  Congress  the  exclusive  power  of  legislation
over  the  District  of  Columbia.  Thus,  although  there  is  no  general
federal  police  power,  Congress  does  have  police  power  over  the
District of Columbia. A is therefore correct.

B is incorrect because there is no general federal police power and
no  specific  congressional  power  to  protect  the  environment.  The
Equal  Protection  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  provides  that
no state shall deny equal protection of the law to any person within
its jurisdiction. Since it applies only to state action and not to action
by the federal government, C is incorrect. The Necessary and Proper
Clause  gives  Congress  the  power  to  do  whatever  is  necessary  and
proper  in  exercising  its  enumerated  powers  under  the  United  States
Constitution.  Although  it  may  result  in  a  finding  that  an  act  of
Congress is valid, it cannot be used to justify a finding that an act of
Congress is invalid. D is therefore incorrect.

97.  B  The  requirement  of  standing  exists  to  assure  that  all  constitutional
issues will be vigorously and thoroughly litigated. To have standing to
challenge  the  constitutionality  of  a  statute,  it  is  necessary  for  the
challenger to have a personal stake in the outcome of the challenge. In
general,  one  who  is  likely  to  sustain  concrete  harm  that  could  be
avoided  by  a  declaration  that  the  statute  is  invalid  has  sufficient
personal stake to challenge its validity. Since the statute will have the
effect  of  requiring  video  arcade  operators  to  pay  the  tax,  and  since
they  will  not  have  to  pay  the  tax  if  the  statute  is  declared
unconstitutional,  a  video  arcade  operator  would  have  sufficient
personal stake to challenge the statute's validity. Since an association
has standing to assert the rights of its members, B is correct.

Since the arcade operators would be paying the tax, persons who use
video arcade machines will not lose anything if the statute is declared
constitutional.  For  this  reason,  A  is  incorrect.  Since  there  is  no
indication  that  the  new  statute  will  have  any  effect  at  all  on  the
manufacturers  of  video 
the
arcade 
manufacturers  of  such  machines  have  no  personal  stake  in  the
outcome  of  the  challenge  and  thus  lack  standing  to  assert  it.  C  is
therefore incorrect. If the statute has any effect on a corporation that
is  in  the  business  of  converting  coin  slots,  it  would  be  to  increase
rather than decrease its earnings. For this reason, D is incorrect.

amusement  machines, 

98. A  Under  the  United  States  Constitution,  direct  taxes  must  be  allocated

213

among  the  states  in  proportion  to  population,  all  customs  duties  and
excise taxes must be uniform throughout the United States, and no tax
may  be  imposed  on  exports  from  any  state.  Except  for  these
limitations  and  prohibitions,  the  congressional  power  to  tax  is
plenary. For this reason, A is correct.

Although the United States Constitution gives Congress the power to
spend  for  the  general  welfare,  B  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no
general  federal  police  power.  So  long  as  a  tax  is  within  the  lawful
power  of  Congress,  a  court  may  not  inquire  into  the  congressional
motive  for  the  imposition  of  that  tax.  For  this  reason,  C  and  D  are
incorrect.

99. B To assure that constitutional issues will be thoroughly and vigorously
litigated, the requirement of standing makes it necessary for a person
challenging the constitutionality of a statute to have a personal stake
in the outcome of the challenge. A challenger has sufficient personal
stake when he or she has suffered or is about to suffer some concrete
harm  that  can  be  remedied  or  prevented  by  the  court.  Since  the
challenger  in  B  asserts  that  the  statute  will  prevent  the  sale  of  his
property,  he  faces  imminent  concrete  harm.  Since  a  declaration  that
the statute is unconstitutional will permit the sale of his property, thus
preventing that harm, he has sufficient personal stake and has standing
to assert the challenge.

Although an association may have standing to assert the rights of its
members, it is necessary that its members would have standing to sue
on  their  own.  A  is  incorrect  because  the  harm  faced  by  the
association members is not sufficiently concrete to give any of them
standing  to  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  the  statute.  A  state
taxpayer  lacks  standing  to  challenge  any  statute  except  one  that
provides  directly  for  an  expenditure  of  public  funds.  C  is  therefore
incorrect. D is incorrect because the harm that the challenger asserts
is neither concrete nor imminent.

100.  C  Under  the  First  Amendment,  a  public  employee  receives  limited
protection  for  speech  or  associational  activities.  Specifically,  the
employee  may  receive  protection  for  activities  that  are  critical  of
superiors  or  that  the  employer  believes  are  inappropriate  for  the
workplace.  If  the  speech  involves  a  matter  of  public  concern,  the
court  will  balance  the  speech  rights  of  the  employee  and  the
government's  interest  as  an  employer  in  promoting  efficiency  on  the

214

job. Importantly, if the employee has a relatively non-public and non-
policy-making  role,  the  court  is  less  likely  to  find  that  the  speech
justifies  dismissal.  Here,  the  plaintiff  may  not  be  fired  because  his
statement was on a matter of public concern, and his non-public and
non-policy-making  role  meant  the  statement  did  not  show  any
significant  job  unfitness  outweighing  his  right  to  comment  on  public
matters as a private person. A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

101. C  Although  the  federal  government  is  immune  from  state  taxation,  that
immunity does not shield persons working for the federal government,
even where the cost of such taxation will eventually be borne by the
federal  government.  For  this  reason,  a  tax  on  building  contractors
who work for the federal government is constitutionally valid so long
as it does not discriminate against them. C is therefore correct.

Because the power to tax is the power to destroy, it has been held that
any  attempt  by  a  state  to  impose  a  tax  directly  on  the  federal
government  or  its  activities  is  constitutionally  invalid.  A  and  B  are
therefore incorrect. Although persons doing business with the federal
government  may  be  taxed  by  a  state,  the  state  law  may  not
constitutionally  discriminate  against  people  doing  business  with  the
federal government. D is incorrect because the law taxes only those
persons leasing land from the federal government.

102.  D  Under  the  First  Amendment,  a  speaker's  right  to  canvass,  ring
doorbells,  and  give  out  handbills  receives  substantial  protection.
While an individual homeowner is always free to tell the speaker that
he or she doesn't want to listen to the speaker, the government cannot
tell the speaker that he or she cannot speak in advance. Consequently,
even if an ordinance is content-neutral and merely designed to protect
unwilling listeners, the government cannot ban all canvassing even if
a majority of people wishes it would do so.

B  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  is  incorrect  because  a  total  ban  on
canvassing violates the First Amendment whether or not the speaker
has other ways to spread his or her message. C is incorrect because
an outright ban is not made lawful simply because it causes a public
benefit.  The  best  the  city  could  do  here  is  to  pass  an  ordinance
limiting canvassing to certain times.

103. A  A  state  law  regulating  private  contracts  violates  the  Obligations  of
Contracts Clause only if it is limited to altering contractual rights and

215

remedies. Thus a law, such as this one, that regulates private conduct
does not violate the Obligations of Contracts Clause merely because
it incidentally reduces the value of existing contracts. Since the statute
is  not  limited  to  altering  contract  rights  and  remedies,  it  does  not
violate this clause, and A is correct.

The Commerce Clause has been held to prohibit discrimination by a
state  against  out-of-staters  since  this  would  have  the  effect  of
preventing  the  free  movement  of  persons  and  things  between  the
states.  Since  the  state  law  permits  the  disposal  of  wastes  generated
inside  the  state  while  prohibiting  the  disposal  of  wastes  generated
outside  the  state,  a  court  could  find  that  it  violates  the  Commerce
Clause.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause
prohibits a state from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws. Since the state law in question denies to
out-of-staters a benefit that is available to state residents, it could be
held  to  violate  equal  protection.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  The
Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  Article  IV  requires  a  state  to
accord  out-of-staters  within  a  state  the  same  treatment  as  residents.
Since this statute does not, it could be held to violate the Privileges
and Immunities Clause. D is therefore incorrect.

104. C  Although  there  are  few  cases  regarding  the  extent  of  the  President's
powers  as  Commander-in-Chief,  it  is  clear  that  they  include  the
command  of  the  military  forces  of  the  United  States.  While  it  is  not
certain  that  this  includes  the  power  to  send  troops  into  a  foreign
country in the absence of any military threat to United States interests,
C is correct because it is the only argument listed that could possibly
justify the presidential order.

A is incorrect because the President's emergency powers apply only
when  there  is  some  threat  to  the  national  interest.  B  is  incorrect
because  the  United  States  Constitution  recognizes  no  humanitarian
power  or  obligation  of  the  President.  The  President's  power  over
foreign  affairs  generally  is  understood  to  refer  only  to  diplomatic
matters,  such  as  the  negotiation  of  treaties  and  executive  agreement
and the receiving of foreign diplomats. D is therefore incorrect.

105. B The United States Constitution grants to Congress the power to spend
for  the  general  welfare.  The  Necessary  and  Proper  Clause  adds  the
power  to  do  whatever  is  necessary  and  proper  to  the  execution  of
Congress's  other  powers.  It  has  been  held  that  in  spending  for  the

216

general welfare, the Necessary and Proper Clause permits Congress
to impose conditions to assure that it gets its money's worth. Since the
federal funds covered by the law are to be used for the treatment of
diseases caused by smoking, it is possible to argue that a required tax
that  makes  cigarettes  more  expensive  and  thus  discourages  people
from  using  them  is  a  necessary  and  proper  way  of  protecting  the
investment of federal funds. While it is not certain that a court would
come  to  this  conclusion,  B  is  the  only  principle  listed  that  could
possibly justify the provision in question.

The  taxing  power  is  the  power  to  lay  and  collect  revenues  for  the
federal government. Since the challenged provision would not require
any  payment  to  the  federal  government  or  result  in  any  federal
revenue,  A  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  general
federal  police  power  under  the  United  States  Constitution.  The
congressional power to regulate interstate commerce is the power to
control  the  movement  of  people  and  things  across  state  lines.  Since
there  is  no  indication  that  the  addition  of  a  seven-cent  tax  by  states
would  have  any  effect  at  all  on  movement  across  state  lines,  D  is
incorrect.

106. D Article IV of the Constitution states that the citizens of each state shall
be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several
states. This is the interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause, which
is  distinguished  from  the  Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the
Fourteenth  Amendment,  which  prevents  a  state  from  denying  certain
rights  of  national  citizenship  (like  the  right  to  travel).  The  interstate
Privilege and Immunities Clause prevents a state from discriminating
against non-residents, but it only covers rights that are fundamental to
national  unity.  Rights  that  are  fundamental  to  national  unity  are  all
related to commerce. These include the right to be employed, the right
to engage in business, and the right to practice one's profession. Here,
since  access  to  employment  is  a  right  fundamental  to  national  unity,
the state's decision to prefer its own citizens is invalid. B is therefore
incorrect.  The  Contract  Clause  generally  involves  situations  where
the government is interfering with a public or private contract that has
already been agreed to. Here, the question doesn't make any specific
mention of a current contract being affected by the state preference. A
and C are therefore incorrect.

107.  D  The  Property  Clause  gives  Congress  the  power  to  make  laws

217

disposing of and making regulations concerning the use of all property
of  the  federal  government.  This  includes  the  power  to  make
restrictions  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  injury  to  federal  lands.
Since Mountain Range National Park is owned and maintained by the
federal  government,  the  Property  Clause  authorizes  Congress  to
prohibit fires within its boundaries. D is therefore correct.

One  of  the  factors  to  be  considered  in  freedom  of  religion  cases  is
whether  the  challengers  are  sincere  in  their  religious  beliefs.  The
United  States  Supreme  Court  has  indicated  that  the  fact  that  a
religious group has engaged in a particular practice for a long period
of time is relevant to determining whether the challengers' beliefs are
sincerely held. Except for this limited purpose, however, the fact that
a particular practice is or is not a traditional one is of no importance.
Since  no  question  has  been  raised  regarding  the  sincerity  of  the
beliefs held by the Followers of the Holy Flame, A is incorrect. B is
incorrect  because  courts  may  not  inquire  into  the  reasonableness  of
any  religious  belief  or  practice.  A  law  that  interferes  with  the  free
exercise of religion is valid if necessary to achieve a compelling state
interest, considering the weight of the government interest, the degree
of  interference  with  a  religious  practice,  and  the  availability  of
alternate  means  of  protecting  the  government  interest.  Although
discrimination between religions and the primarily secular effect of a
law are factors to be considered in Establishment Clause cases, they
play  no  role  in  free  exercise  challenges.  For  this  reason,  C  is
incorrect.

108. A  Under  the  police  power,  states  may  regulate  the  health,  safety,  and
welfare of their citizens. The regulation requiring personal trainers to
have a college degree in physical therapy or sports medicine does not
involve  a  suspect  classification,  so  the  rational  basis  test  would
apply. The goal of protecting citizens from injury is clearly legitimate.
A  court  will  uphold  the  classification  if  there  is  any  conceivable
purpose served by the classification. Here, it is rational for the state
to believe limiting the employment of personal trainers to those with
college degrees in physical therapy or sports medicine would protect
the  health  and  safety  of  state  citizens.  Consequently,  A  is  the  best
answer.

B  is  incorrect  because  even  though  no  suspect  classification  is
involved, a court will not uphold the law if there is no rational basis

218

for  it.  C  is  incorrect  because  financial  ability  is  not  a  suspect
classification,  and  thus  would  not  be  held  to  the  standard  of
substantially  related  to  an  important  government  interest.  D  is
incorrect  because  the  fact  this  law  will  regulate  the  activities  of
privately-owned gyms will not change the analysis.

109.  A  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  United  States  Constitution
prohibits  classifications  based  on  invidious  discrimination.  Not  all
classifications  are  invidious,  however  (e.g.,  persons  licensed  as
attorneys  are  not  permitted  to  perform  surgery,  but  persons  licensed
as  physicians  are).  A  system  of  economic  classification  is  not
invidious if it has a rational basis. If it is more important for lawyers
to keep up to date on the law than it is for doctors to keep up to date
on  developments  on  medicine,  then  the  system  of  classification
adopted  by  the  Continuing  Professional  Education  Act  is  not
invidious and does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

B is incorrect because even where a state has the right to determine
conditions for a license, it may not do so in a way that denies equal
protection.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  states  may  not  exercise  their
powers  in  a  way  that  violates  constitutionally  protected  rights.
Although the United States Constitution does not specifically protect
the  right  to  practice  a  profession,  it  does  protect  the  right  to  equal
protection.  If  the  statute  invidiously  discriminates  against  certain
professionals,  it  violates  that  right.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  state
bar  association  does  not  have  the  power  to  waive  the  constitutional
rights of its members.

110.  A  The  Eleventh  Amendment  bars  action  against  a  state  for  money
damages in a federal court by a resident or non-resident of the state if
a  judgment  in  the  action  would  have  to  be  paid  out  of  the  state's
general treasury.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  suit  arises  under  a  federal  statute.  C  is
incorrect because this question does not depend on who the plaintiff's
employer  was,  since  the  action  by  employees  of  the  builder  is  for
damages resulting from the state's failure to require the builder to pay
the $10 wage. Unless the employees were aware of their rights, they
could  not  have  waived  them.  D  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no
indication that the employees knowingly waived their rights.

111.  C  Standing  to  challenge  the  constitutional  validity  of  a  state  statute

219

requires  a  personal  stake  in  the  outcome.  The  fact  that  the
organization's production will not be shown so long as the statute is
enforced is a sufficient personal stake to confer standing.

A is incorrect because the personal stake thus created is more than an
intellectual  interest.  B  is  incorrect  because  a  non-recognized
organization would be denied benefits under the statute and thus has
the  necessary  personal  stake.  D  is  incorrect  because  an  affront  to
religious  sensibilities  is  insufficient  to  confer  standing  except  in  a
challenge to the validity of a tax or spending law.

112. C Article III of the United States Constitution gives the federal courts the
power  to  decide  questions  arising  under  the  federal  Constitution.
Since the action in the United States district court is for an injunction
based  on  the  invalidity  of  a  state  statute  under  the  United  States
Constitution, the United States district court has jurisdiction.

A state court decision that rests on an adequate state ground may not
be  appealed  to  the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  but  A  is  incorrect
because this is a new action, not an appeal of a state court decision.
The  abstention  doctrine  may  prevent  a  federal  court  from  taking  a
question  regarding  the  constitutionality  of  a  state  law  when  the
meaning of the state law is uncertain and may be cleared up by a state
court decision. B is incorrect because there is no uncertainty about the
meaning  of  the  state  statute  in  question,  and  therefore  there  is  no
reason to wait for interpretation by a state court. B is also incorrect
because  no  relevant  state  proceeding  is  pending.  D  is  incorrect
because  although  the  Eleventh  Amendment  prohibits  a  federal  court
from hearing a claim for damages against a state, it does not prevent a
constitutional challenge to a state law.

113. C Three tests exist to determine whether a state system of classification
violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  depending  on  the  basis  of  the
classification. Most statutes that regulate economic or social interests
are  constitutionally  valid  if  they  have  a  rational  basis.  Statutes  that
discriminate  against  suspect  classes  or  that  interfere  with  a
fundamental  right  are  valid  only  if  they  are  necessary  to  achieve  a
compelling  state  interest.  Statutes  that  discriminate  against  classes
that  are  close  to  being  suspect  or  that  interfere  with  rights  that,
although  not  fundamental,  are  very  important,  are  valid  only  if  they
are substantially related to an important government interest. Although
alienage  is  ordinarily  regarded  as  a  suspect  classification  requiring

220

application of the compelling state interest test, the rational basis test
is applied when the discriminatory legislation involves standards for
employment in executing public policy or performing functions that go
to  the  heart  of  representative  government.  The  argument  in  C  is
effective in either event.

So  far,  the  right  to  earn  a  living  has  not  been  found  to  be  a
fundamental interest. A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect because
systems of classification that serve a compelling state interest are not
invidious even if based on alienage. D is an incorrect statement of the
law; aliens are “persons” under the Equal Protection Clause. Even if
it  was  a  correct  statement,  however,  D  would  not  support  the
woman's position.

114.  D  It  has  been  held  that  a  state  may  establish  durational  residency
requirements to assure that voters will have sufficient interest in the
outcome  of  an  election.  It  has  also  been  held,  however,  that  overly
long  durational  requirements  serve  no  compelling  state  interest  and
are  therefore  invalid.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has
specifically held one year to be too long. See Dunn v. Blumstein, 405
U.S. 330 (1972).

A and C are therefore incorrect. The United States Constitution sets
requirements  for  determining  eligibility  to  vote  in  national  elections
but is silent about the right of aliens to vote in local elections. B  is
incorrect, however, because the city ordinance extends the right to all
persons who satisfy the residency requirement.

115. A Under the Supremacy Clause, a state law is invalid to the extent that it
is  inconsistent  with  a  valid  federal  law  affecting  the  same  subject
matter.  Although  in  paying  its  employees,  the  state  may  be  immune
from federal regulation, this is so only when the state is engaging in a
traditional state function. The United States Supreme Court has held,
however,  that  engaging  in  interstate  commerce  is  not  a  traditional
state  function.  For  this  reason,  federal  law  fixing  the  wages  of
persons  employed  in  interstate  commerce  is  applicable  to  state
employees, and, under the Supremacy Clause, supersedes inconsistent
state law.

B is incorrect because there is no general federal police power (i.e.,
power  to  legislate  for  the  general  welfare).  In  determining  whether
the  state  is  engaging  in  a  traditional  state  function,  and  thereby

221

possibly  immune  from  federal  regulation,  it  is  necessary  to  be  more
specific  than  the  argument  in  C  would  suggest.  Although  paying
employees  is  a  traditional  state  function,  paying  them  to  operate
interstate cruise boats is not. C is therefore incorrect. D is incorrect
because the immunity granted to states under the Eleventh Amendment
is applicable only in federal courts.

116. C The United States Supreme Court has held (Stanley v. Georgia, 394
U.S.  557  (1969))  that  there  is  a  constitutional  right  to  privacy  that
for
protects 
noncommercial use.

the  private  possession  of  obscene  materials 

A is incorrect because the First Amendment freedoms of expression
protect the rights to speak or print, offering only indirect protection to
the rights to see, read, or hear. B is incorrect for two reasons: First,
one  is  not  ordinarily  permitted  to  assert  the  constitutional  rights  of
third  persons.  Although  vendors  may  assert  the  rights  of  their
customers,  no  rule  has  developed  that  permits  vendees  to  assert  the
right of their suppliers. Second, freedom of speech and the press does
not  protect  the  publication  of  obscenity.  D,  too,  is  incorrect  for  two
reasons:  First,  there  is  no  indication  that  the  statute  in  question  was
not  designed  to  punish  purchasers  of  obscenity,  and,  second,  if  the
defendant  presented  an  obscene  performance  as  charged,  he  is  a
publisher of obscenity.

117.  A  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the
United  States  Constitution  provides  that  no  state  shall  deny  to  any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Since
the  Building  Rental  Tax  is  imposed  on  those  who  occupy  rented
space, but not on those who occupy space that they own, it is possible
to  argue  that  the  law  denies  equal  protection.  This  argument  might
fail, but it is the only one listed that has any chance at all of success.

Although  the  federal  government  is  immune  from  taxation  by  the
states,  that  immunity  is  not  enjoyed  by  persons  doing  business  with
the  federal  government,  even  though  their  business  is  specifically
authorized by federal statute. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

118.  B  Federal  statutes  limit  the  Supreme  Court's  review  of  state  court
decisions  to  those  of  the  highest  state  court  to  which  appeal  is
possible. If no appeal is possible in the state courts, then there is no
reason why the United States Supreme Court cannot review decisions

222

of the municipal court.

A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  if  appeal  to  a  higher  state  court
were  possible,  the  case  would  not  be  ripe  for  consideration  by  the
Supreme Court until the highest state court decided it. C is incorrect
because  under  Article  III  of  the  United  States  Constitution,  the
appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is regulated by Congress
and  not  by  the  states.  At  present,  applicable  federal  statutes  limit
Supreme  Court  review  to  decisions  of  federal  courts  and  of  the
highest state courts. D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  this  limitation
does not appear in the Constitution.

119.  B  The  state  may  impose  “time,  place,  and  manner”  restrictions  on
expression  in  protection  of  its  interest  in  promoting  free  access  to
government  buildings  and  the  orderly  conduct  of  governmental
activities. These restrictions may not, however, be based on message
content  because  such  restrictions  unconstitutionally  interfere  with
freedom of speech. Since the statute permits demonstrations involving
one  kind  of  message  and  prohibits  demonstrations  involving  a
different kind of message, it violates the First Amendment.

Although the United States Supreme Court has held that a statute may
not  completely  prohibit  expression  in  traditional  public  forums  like
streets and parks, A is incorrect because this statute is directed only
at the sidewalks in front of government office buildings and does not
prevent  the  use  of  other  parts  of  the  public  forum  for  purposes  of
expression.  The  state's  compelling  interest  in  the  orderly  conduct  of
governmental  affairs  and  in  the  protection  of  free  access  to
government buildings would probably justify a law prohibiting noise
or  demonstrations  in  front  of  government  office  buildings.  C  and  D
are incorrect, however, because the statute imposes restrictions on the
message content of such demonstrations.

120. C Federal taxpayers are usually regarded as being too remote from the
expenditure  of  federal  funds  to  have  standing  to  challenge  them,  but
state taxpayers are not. If a state law involves a direct expenditure of
funds,  as  this  one  does,  any  state  taxpayer  may  have  standing  to
challenge it.

A is incorrect because standing requires a personal stake even if the
challenge is based on an alleged violation of the First Amendment. B
is incorrect for several reasons, but the simplest is that a statute that

223

authorizes  the  advertising  of  services  that  already  exist  does  not
threaten  the  rights  of  unborn  children.  D  is  incorrect  because
philosophical,  moral,  intellectual,  or  political  interest  is  insufficient
to confer standing on a person challenging a law.

121. B The Thirteenth Amendment abolishes slavery and gives Congress the
power  to  make  laws  enforcing  its  provisions.  Discrimination  based
solely on race has been held to involve a “badge” of slavery that the
Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress to abolish.

The  Commerce  Clause  gives  Congress  the  power  to  regulate
interstate  commerce  but  imposes  no  obligations  on  anyone.  The
organization's  policy  could  not,  therefore,  violate  “the  spirit  of  the
Commerce Clause,” so A is incorrect. C is incorrect because racial
discrimination  violates  the  United  States  Constitution  only  when
practiced by government. D  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  federal
police  power,  and  thus  there  is  no  congressional  power  to  legislate
for the general welfare.

122. D Whether it is classified as a right or a privilege, a license to practice
medicine  is  an  entitlement  of  which  a  person  cannot  be  deprived
without due process. A is therefore incorrect. Since the denial of this
entitlement  was  based  on  an  arrest  that  did  not  involve  a  hearing,  it
has  been  accomplished  without  due  process  and  thus  violates  the
student's constitutional right.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  federal  courts  have  jurisdiction  to
adjudicate federal questions, and an asserted violation of rights under
the  United  States  Constitution  obviously  raises  a  federal  question.
The deprivation of property interest without a hearing violates the due
process  requirement,  even  though  not  arbitrary  or  capricious.  C  is
therefore incorrect.

123. A If diesel exhaust is harmful to the environment, a tax discouraging the
use of the diesel-powered vehicles might be beneficial to the general
welfare.  Since  Article  I,  Section  8  of  the  United  States  Constitution
gives Congress the power to impose taxes to provide for the general
welfare, A is the best argument in support of the tax.

Although  Congress  may  tax  for  the  general  welfare,  B  is  incorrect
because  there  is  no  “federal  police  power.”  C  is  incorrect  because
the tax is not tied to spending, and there is no indication either that it
is applicable only in states that have received federal highway funds

224

or  that  it  will  result  in  more  efficient  use  of  such  funds.  A  taxpayer
has  standing  to  challenge  the  validity  of  a  tax  that,  if  valid,  will
require  payment  from  the  one  challenging  it  since  he  or  she  has  the
necessary  personal  stake  in  the  outcome  of  the  litigation.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

124. D The President may have the power to abrogate treaties when certain
circumstances  make  such  abrogation  necessary  for  protection  of  the
national  interest.  He  or  she  does  not  have  the  power  to  suspend
enforcement  of  laws  enacted  by  Congress,  however,  except  in
extraordinary  circumstances  (e.g.,  wartime  emergencies,  etc.).  Once
Congress enacted the National Tax Immunity Act, the immunity of the
country's nationals was protected by law, rather than by treaty.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

125. D Since the United States Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction to
determine  whether  a  statute  violates  the  provisions  of  a  state
constitution,  it  could  not  overturn  the  state  court's  finding  that  the
statute  in  question  violates  the  state  constitution.  A,  B,  and  C  are
therefore incorrect.

126.  C  The  Necessary  and  Proper  Clause  permits  Congress  to  do  what  is
necessary and proper in carrying out the powers delegated to it by the
Constitution.  It  is  therefore  irrelevant  to  the  constitutionality  of  this
state statute.

A  might  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  section  is  invalid  since  it
obviously discriminates against interstate commerce. B might lead to
the  same  conclusion  since  the  higher  license  fee  imposed  on
nonresidents  could  constitute  invidious  discrimination.  If  Section  1,
which requires a license, is constitutionally invalid, Section 2, which
sets the fees for such licenses, could not be validly enforced. For this
reason,  D  might  likewise  justify  the  conclusion  that  Section  2  is
invalid.

127.  A  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits  invidious  discrimination.
Although a literacy requirement in a voting statute is not necessarily
invidious, A is the only reason listed that could result in a judgment
that the statute is unconstitutional.

Literacy  tests  have  sometimes  been  found  to  be  a  tool  of  racial
discrimination,  but  such  a  finding  generally  leads  to  the  conclusion

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

225

that there has been a denial of equal protection rather than a violation
of the somewhat narrower prohibitions of the Fifteenth Amendment. B
is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because the literacy requirement
does  not  prohibit  or  otherwise  regulate  the  written  use  of  foreign
languages.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  Twenty-Sixth  Amendment
prohibits only discrimination in the franchise based on age.

128.  D  Since  the  United  States  Constitution  grants  Congress  the  power  to
spend  for  the  general  welfare,  Congress  is  entitled  to  attach
conditions  to  its  grants  to  assure  that  such  spending  does,  in  fact,
promote the general welfare. The use of federal funds in a way that is
likely to give cancer to schoolchildren would not promote the general
welfare, and so Congress is empowered to guard against it.

A is incorrect because Congress does not have the power to regulate
education.  B  is  incorrect  because  receipt  of  federal  funds  does  not
result  in  a  surrender  by  the  states  of  the  powers  reserved  to  them
under  the  Constitution.  C  is  incorrect  because  Congress's  power  to
regulate  by  attaching  conditions  to  federal  spending  programs  is
limited,  at  least,  to  conditions  that  are  themselves  constitutionally
valid.

129. D  The  United  States  Constitution  gives  the  federal  courts  jurisdiction

over all cases arising under the Constitution.

Since  the  plaintiff's  argument  is  that  the  statute  violates  the  United
States  Constitution,  and  thus  involves  a  federal  question,  A  is
incorrect.  The  Constitution  does  not  give 
the  federal  courts
jurisdiction over cases between a state and a citizen of that state, so C
is  incorrect.  But  because  a  federal  question  is  involved,  B  is  also
incorrect.

130.  D  In  deciding  whether  an  interference  with  an  activity  required  by
religious  belief  violates  the  Free  Exercise  Clause,  the  courts  apply
the  compelling  state  interest  standard.  Thus,  if  a  statute  serves  a
compelling  state  interest  and  is  sufficiently  narrow  to  be  the  least
burdensome  method  of  achieving 
it  may  be
constitutionally  valid  even  though  it  interferes  with  a  particular
religious practice.

interest, 

that 

A is incorrect for two reasons: First, associations are frequently held
to  have  standing  to  assert  the  constitutional  rights  of  their  members,
and second, since the statute may necessitate a change in the school's

226

curriculum with attendant financial outlays, the school has a personal
stake in the outcome. Although the sincerity of a professed religious
belief  may  be  examined  in  a  free  exercise  challenge,  B  is  incorrect
because the Establishment Clause prevents a court from inquiring into
the  reasonableness  of  a  religious  belief.  Even  a  law  that  is  not
primarily intended to interfere with a religious belief may violate the
Free Exercise Clause if it has that effect. C is therefore incorrect.

131.  A  The  Necessary  and  Proper  Clause  authorizes  Congress  to  do
whatever  is  necessary  and  proper  in  carrying  out  its  other  powers,
and  is  therefore  irrelevant  to  the  given  facts,  which  involve  a
municipal ordinance.

Although  certain  regulations  concerning  the  time,  place,  and  manner
of  holding  public  meetings  are  constitutionally  permissible,  such
regulations may not be directed against or in favor of particular types
of message content. B might, therefore, be a good argument since the
ordinance requires a fee for a permit to conduct an assembly for some
purposes,  but  not  for  others.  A  law  is  vague  or  overbroad  if  the
person of reasonable intelligence would not be able to understand its
terms.  Since  Section  2  makes  special  provision  for  “political
campaign” rallies without defining them, it is possible to argue that it
is  vague  or  overbroad.  C  might,  therefore,  be  a  valid  argument.  If
Section 1 is vague or overbroad (which it probably is in view of the
unfettered discretion that it grants to the mayor), it cannot be enforced.
If Section 1 — which requires a permit — cannot be enforced then,
obviously, neither can Section 2 — which fixes a fee for the permit
application.  Thus,  in  spite  of  Section  3,  which  purports  to  make
Sections 1 and 2 severable, D is a good argument.

132. C The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits
invidious discrimination by the state. If the state imposes a tax on the
transportation of unrefined petroleum, but not on the transportation of
any  other  product,  it  is  possible  to  conclude  that  it  is  invidiously
discriminating against transporters of unrefined petroleum. While it is
not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the argument in
C is the only one listed that could possibly result in a finding that the
statute is unconstitutional.

Although  the  United  States  Constitution  is  silent  as  to  the  rights  of
states  to  tax  interstate  commerce,  it  is  generally  understood  that  a
state tax is valid if it requires interstate commerce to pay its fair share

227

of the value of state services without discriminating in favor of local
commerce.  Thus,  the  fact  that  the  tax  is  imposed  on  interstate
transporters  as  well  as  local  ones  is  not  enough  to  make  it  invalid,
and  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  state's  power  to  tax  activities
performed  within  the  state  does  not  depend  on  a  statutory  grant  of
authority  by  the  federal  government.  Thus,  unless  a  federal  statute
specifically  prohibits  a  particular  form  of  state  taxation,  it  is
presumed  valid.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  state  tax  on  interstate
commerce is ordinarily valid if it bears a fair relationship to services
provided by the state to the taxpayer and will not produce cumulative
tax  burdens.  Since  transporters  of  petroleum  receive  the  benefit  of
using  state  roads,  a  tax  based  on  distance  and  the  quantity  of  cargo
transported bears a fair relationship to that benefit.

Although  neighboring  states  may  impose  similar  taxes,  there  is  no
danger of duplicative taxing since the amount of the tax is related to
activity actually performed within the state. D is therefore incorrect.

133.  B  Article  I,  Section  8  of  the  United  States  Constitution  empowers
Congress  to  spend  money  for  the  general  welfare.  Under  the
Necessary  and  Proper  Clause,  this  spending  power  includes  the
power to impose conditions designed to assure that Congress will get
its  money's  worth  for  sums  spent.  Since  the  size  of  the  vehicles  that
use a highway could affect its longevity, the condition contained in the
State  Highway  Subsidy  Act  is  probably  a  valid  exercise  of  the
spending power.

A is incorrect because there is no general federal police power. The
Property Clause (Article IV, Section 3) empowers Congress to make
needful rules and regulations concerning federal property. Since the
State  Highway  Subsidy  Act  applies  to  the  construction  of  state
highways, the Property Clause is inapplicable and C is incorrect. The
Eleventh  Amendment  prevents  federal  courts  from  hearing  certain
claims  against  states.  It  is  therefore  inapplicable  to  determining  the
constitutionality of a federal law. D is therefore incorrect.

134. A The United States Supreme Court may review a decision when a state
court has held a state law valid under the United States Constitution.
Here,  the  state  court  has  held  the  law  was  valid  under  the  Equal
Protection  Clause  of  the  United  States  Constitution,  so  review  is
available.

228

the 

law 

B  is  incorrect  because  the  important  point  is  that  the  state  court  has
found 
the  United  States
to  be  constitutional  under 
Constitution, not that the highest court in the state denied certiorari. C
is  incorrect  because  whether  a  particular  classification  is  suspect
determines  the  burden  of  proof  to  be  met  for  a  constitutional
challenge,  not  the  availability  of  Supreme  Court  review.  D  is
incorrect because the state supreme court's denial of certiorari means
the appellate court was the highest state court available to the man's
challenge.

135. A  Although  expert  testimony  is  not  necessary  to  establish  that  a  work
does or does not have serious value, it is admissible for that purpose,
so A is correct and D is incorrect. Unless the material is targeted to a
specific  group,  however,  the  standards  of  the  adult  community  must
be applied.

B and C are therefore incorrect.

136. B A statute that discriminates on the basis of age is constitutional if its
system  of  classification  has  a  rational  basis  (i.e.,  if  facts  can  be
imagined  that  would  make  the  statute  a  reasonable  means  of
accomplishing a legitimate purpose). Protection of public health is a
legitimate legislative purpose. Thus, if the work of physical education
teachers is hazardous to the health of older persons, the statute's age
classification  is  a  reasonable  means  of  achieving  a  legitimate
legislative purpose.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  physical  condition  of  one  60-year-old
person is not sufficient to establish a rational basis for a statute that
discriminates against all persons of that age. Even when exercising its
legitimate powers, a state must do so in a way that is consistent with
requirements  of  the  United  States  Constitution.  C  is  therefore
incorrect. Since some physical education teachers may be unqualified
for other teaching positions, the fact assumed in D would leave them
no better off than they would be without it. D is therefore incorrect.

137. D Under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, a state law is invalid if it
is  inconsistent  with  a  valid  federal  law  covering  the  same  subject
matter.  It  is  easy  to  decide  whether  a  state  law  that  specifically
contradicts  a  federal  law  is  invalid  under  the  Supremacy  Clause.  It
becomes  more  difficult  when,  as  here,  the  state  law  prohibits
something  that  the  federal  law  does  not  mention  at  all.  The  fact  that

229

the  federal  law  is  silent  about  aliens  serving  on  state  juries  might
mean that Congress has permitted aliens to serve on state juries by not
prohibiting such service. It could also mean, however, that Congress
deliberately  left  the  matter  to  regulation  by  the  states.  In  deciding
which conclusion to draw, it is necessary to consider the dominance
of federal interest. Since Congress has primary authority to determine
the legal status of aliens, state legislation that affects aliens is likely
to be preempted by congressional silence. While it is not certain that
a court would come to this conclusion, the argument set forth in D is
the  only  one  listed  that  could  support  a  reversal  of  the  defendant's
conviction.

Although  state  laws  that  discriminate  on  the  basis  of  alienage  are
unconstitutional unless they are necessary to serve a compelling state
interest, they are not per se in-valid. (Also remember that there's an
important exception to the general rule that a compelling state interest
must  be  served:  Where  the  government  job  involves  a  “traditional
government function,” even just a rational basis is enough to make the
restriction of the job to citizens valid.) A is therefore incorrect. The
Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment
prohibits  a  state  from  interfering  with  rights  that  result  from  United
States citizenship. It is inapplicable to this case since aliens are not
United States citizens. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect for two
reasons: First, discrimination against aliens is not necessarily based
on  race,  color,  or  previous  condition  of  servitude,  and  second,  the
Fifteenth  Amendment  prohibits  such  discrimination  only  in  denying
the right to vote.

138. D  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  age  is  not  a  suspect
classification.  Consequently,  a  claim  of  age  discrimination  will  be
unsuccessful  if  the  government  can  show  the  challenged  law  has  a
rational basis. Therefore, B is incorrect.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  “achieve  a  compelling  state  interest”
standard only applies to classifications based on race, alienage, and
national  origin,  not  gender.  For  classifications  based  on  gender,  the
law will only be upheld if it is substantially related to an important
government interest. Therefore, C is incorrect.

139. D Like treaties, executive agreements are the supreme law of the land.
Unlike  treaties,  however,  executive  agreements  do  not  stand  on  the
same  footing  as  acts  of  Congress.  Thus,  while  a  treaty  supersedes

230

prior  inconsistent  federal  statutes,  an  executive  agreement  does  not.
For this reason, Congress may, by statute, limit the president's power
to make executive agreements. If Congress had done so by a prior law
that prohibited the President from making this kind of agreement, the
agreement may be declared void.

Some  executive  agreements  require  subsequent  congressional  action
to operate. Others, called “self-executing,” require no subsequent act
of  Congress  to  become  operative.  This  distinction  is  related  to  the
effect  of  an  executive  agreement,  but  not  to  its  validity.  For  this
reason,  A  is  incorrect.  As  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  prevents  invidious  discrimination  by  the
states, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment bars arbitrary
discrimination by the federal government. When federal regulation (to
which an executive agreement is equivalent) has nationwide impact,
however,  the  existence  of  overriding  national  interests  may  permit
regulation that would be forbidden to the states. For this reason, the
fact that the executive agreement imposes an increased tax burden on
other  corporations  is  not  by  itself  sufficient  to  make  it  invalid.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  President's  power  to
make  executive  agreements  is  inherent,  and  therefore  it  does  not
require specific authorization from Congress.

140. D A case is not yet ripe and is therefore not yet decidable by a federal
court  if  it  has  not  yet  become  sufficiently  concrete  to  be  easily
adjudicated.  Here,  since  the  plaintiffs  have  not  been  specific  about
the precise acts that they wish to carry out, a court will likely find the
case  is  not  yet  ripe.  When  a  federal  court  determines  an  action  is
unripe, it must dismiss the action entirely.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

141. B In deciding equal protection cases, the United States Supreme Court
has developed three levels of scrutiny. State regulations of social or
economic interests are valid if they have a rational basis. Statutes that
discriminate  against  a  suspect  class  or  that  interfere  with  a
fundamental right are not valid unless they are necessary to achieve a
compelling  state  interest.  Statutes  that  discriminate  against  a  group
that  is  close  to  being  a  suspect  class  are  valid  only  if  they  are
substantially  related  to  important  government  interests.  It  has  been
held that discrimination based on age does not involve a suspect class
or a group that is close to being a suspect class. For this reason, the

231

statute is valid if it has a rational basis. C is therefore incorrect.

The  Eleventh  Amendment  prevents  the  federal  courts  from  hearing
damage claims against a state. Since this proceeding is not an action
for  damages,  however,  the  Eleventh  Amendment  does  not  prevent  it
from being heard. A is therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because age
is  not  a  suspect  class,  and  because  even  a  statute  that  does
discriminate against a suspect class may be valid if it is necessary to
achieve a compelling state interest.

142. D Under its police power, a state may enact laws to protect the welfare
of its residents, even though those laws impose a burden of some kind
on  interstate  commerce,  so  long  as  there  is  no  reasonable,  less
burdensome  way  of  accomplishing  that  purpose.  If,  however,  the
burden that it imposes on interstate commerce is an unreasonable one,
the statute will be in-valid under the Commerce Clause. Although it is
not  certain  that  the  argument  in  D  would  succeed,  it  is  the  only  one
listed that could possibly support granting of the injunction.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  that  a  statute  interferes  in  some  way
with interstate commerce is not by itself sufficient to make it invalid.
Since the state's police power permits it to enact laws for the welfare
of its residents, the purity of food is clearly a matter of local concern.
B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Powers  reserved  to  the  states  may  be
delegated by them to their municipalities and agencies. C is incorrect
because the state's power to regulate commerce is concurrent with the
federal  commerce  power  and  may  thus  be  exercised  by  municipal
governments within the state.

143. B A and C  are  inaccurate  statements  since  there  is  no  general  federal
police  power.  B  is  an  accurate  statement  since  the  spending  power
entitles the federal government to take steps to assure that its spending
benefits the public welfare.

144. A In order to assert a constitutional claim, a person or organization must
have  standing.  This  means  the  person  or  organization  must  have  a
personal stake or direct interest in the outcome. To have standing, the
person or organization must be in danger of suffering some concrete
injury  that  would  be  prevented  or  remedied  if  the  court  grants  the
requested relief. Because the doctor actually uses the city pools, and
the  new  fee  will  increase  his  cost  in  doing  so,  he  will  suffer  a
concrete injury if the new fee is put in place. If a court finds the new

232

injury.
fee  unconstitutional, 
Consequently,  he  has  standing  to  challenge  the  new  fee.  His  wealth
and ownership of his own pool are irrelevant.

the  doctor  will  not  suffer 

that 

B  is  incorrect  because  the  family  only  fears  that  an  increase  could
affect  them  in  the  future.  Unless  the  family  could  show  the  feared
effect is likely to occur, they have no concrete injury. C is incorrect
because a mere intellectual interest in the outcome is not sufficient for
standing. Unless the organization can show its members actually use
the city pools, it lacks the personal stake necessary for standing. D is
incorrect because a declaration that the fee is unconstitutional would
likely  cause  the  very  harm  the  organization  of  city  lifeguards  fears.
Consequently,  such  a  declaration  would  not  prevent  them  from
suffering an injury.

145. D A restriction on speech in a traditional public forum such as a public
park  or  street  corner  is  subject  to  strict  scrutiny.  This  means  the
restriction  must  be  narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  a  compelling
governmental  interest.  The  government  can  impose  time,  place,  and
manner restrictions on speech, but those restrictions must be content-
neutral. This ordinance specifically targets political speech, so A is
incorrect. B is incorrect because the government may not limit speech
on  property  simply  because  it  is  the  property  owner.  C  is  incorrect
because it states the wrong level of scrutiny.

146. C To assure that constitutional challenges will be fully and vigorously
prosecuted, the concept of standing requires that a person challenging
the  constitutionality  of  a  statute  have  some  personal  stake  in  the
outcome.  Usually  this  means  that  the  challenger  must  face  some
imminent concrete harm that would be avoided if the court grants the
relief that he or she requests. Since the plaintiff's complaint is that the
law effectively prevents her from serving on a jury, she lacks standing
unless being deprived of an opportunity to serve on a jury constitutes
concrete harm.

Since  the  plaintiff  does  not  have  a  driver's  license,  the  existing  law
makes her ineligible for jury service. Since a declaration that the law
is  invalid  would  remove  the  disability  imposed  by  the  statute,  the
plaintiff's failure to have a driver's license is more likely to result in a
finding  that  she  has  standing  than  a  finding  that  she  does  not.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  Under  the  existing  law,  the  plaintiff  will  not  be
called as a prospective juror so long as she does not have a driver's

233

license. On the other hand, a declaration that the law is invalid would
have  the  effect  of  making  her  eligible  to  be  called  as  a  prospective
juror.  Since  this  would  eliminate  the  harm  that  the  existing  statute
causes, the fact that she has never been called is more likely to defeat
than  to  support  the  motion  to  dismiss  her  claim.  B  is  therefore
incorrect.  Since  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  the  plaintiff  is  or  is
about to become a litigant in the County Court, the possibility that she
will be denied due process if she ever does become one is not harm
that is imminent or concrete. D is therefore incorrect.

CONTRACTS

1. Immediately after his graduation from college in June, the plaintiff

announced his plan to begin law school the following September and to

237

marry his girlfriend in December. The plaintiff's father was afraid that
marriage during the plaintiff's first year of law school might cause him
to fail or drop out of school. He called the plaintiff on the phone and
said that if the plaintiff postponed his wedding plans until after the
completion of his first year of law school, he would give him a cash
bonus of $1,000 and would pay the plaintiff's tuition for the second
year of law school. The plaintiff agreed and called his girlfriend to tell
her that he wanted to postpone the wedding. She became so angry at
him that she broke off their engagement. Two months later, the
plaintiff's girlfriend married someone else.

The plaintiff's father died soon after the plaintiff began school, but the
plaintiff successfully completed his first year. Although the plaintiff
earned excellent grades, he decided that he was not really interested
enough in the law to want to continue his legal education. After failing
to register for a second year of law school, he notified his father's
administrator of his decision. The plaintiff said that although there
would be no tuition expense, he expected to be paid the $1,000 cash
bonus that his father had promised him. The administrator refused to
pay anything.

If the plaintiff brought suit against the administrator of his father's
estate for $1,000, the plaintiff would probably be

(A) unsuccessful, because his contract with his father violated public

policy.

(B) unsuccessful, because the plaintiff failed to register for a second

year of law school.

(C) unsuccessful, because the plaintiff's death terminated his offer.

(D) successful.

2. A furniture dealer had 500 chairs for sale. The chairs had a fair market
value of $100 each. The manufacturer had discontinued production of
the chairs, however, and they were the last ones the dealer had. For
that reason, the dealer advertised them at $75 each, even though at that
price, her profit would be only $10 per chair. An interior decorator
had contracted with the dealer to provide furniture for a new hotel. On
May 4, after seeing the chairs advertised, the decorator wired the
dealer, “Please ship me 500 chairs as advertised at $75 per chair
COD.” On May 5, immediately upon receipt of the telegram, the dealer

238

wired the decorator, “Accept your offer. Will ship 500 chairs
tomorrow.” The decorator telephoned the dealer immediately upon
receipt of the dealer's telegram on May 6, saying that, after discussing
the chairs with his client, he had decided to cancel the order. On May
7, the dealer sold all the chairs to another buyer at $75 each. If the
dealer sued the decorator for breach of contract, the court should
award the dealer

(A) $5,000 (500 chairs at $10 profit per chair).

(B) $37,500 (500 chairs at $75 per chair).

(C) $12,500 (fair market value of $100 minus contract price of $75

times 500 chairs).

(D) nothing, since the dealer sustained no damage.

3. On March 12, the plaintiff hired the defendant to construct a three-car
garage on the plaintiff's realty. After negotiation, they entered into a
valid written contract that fixed the price at $8,000. According to the
terms of the contract, the plaintiff was to pay $4,000 when the work
was half completed, on or before April 25, and to pay the balance upon
completion. All work was to be completed by June 1. On April 10,
when the work was one-quarter complete, the partial structure was
totally destroyed in a fire that started without fault by either party. The
damage done by the fire made it impossible to complete construction
on time. Because he was committed to begin construction on a hotel on
June 1, the defendant notified the plaintiff on April 12 that he would
perform no further work for the plaintiff. The plaintiff subsequently
hired another contractor to build the garage at a price of $9,000. The
plaintiff instituted an action against the defendant for damages resulting
from breach of contract, and the defendant asserted a defense based on
impossibility of performance. The court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the fire was not his fault.

(B) the defendant, because he has not yet received any compensation

from the plaintiff.

(C) the plaintiff, because the work was only one-quarter complete when

fire destroyed the structure.

(D) the plaintiff, because the defendant's obligation was to work for the

plaintiff until June 1.

4. The buyer agreed to purchase 250 2” × 4” construction-grade wooden

239

studs from the seller by a written contract that provided that the buyer
would make payment prior to inspection. The studs were delivered to
the buyer by truck and were covered with a canvas tarpaulin when they
arrived at the buyer's work site. The driver demanded payment before
he would unload or uncover the studs.

The buyer refused to pay for the studs before inspecting them, and the
driver returned them to the seller. If the seller asserts a claim for
breach of contract against the buyer, the court should find for

(A) the seller, because the buyer's refusal to pay prior to inspection

was a breach.

(B) the seller, because the buyer's refusal to pay prior to inspection was

an anticipatory repudiation.

(C) the buyer, because the contract provision calling for payment prior

to inspection was unconscionable.

(D) the buyer, because the seller failed to deliver the studs.

5. A manufacturer of computer hardware and software was seeking a way
to speed up the operation of its Basic Computer Program. On March 1,
it posted the following notice in the employees' lounge:

The stockholders of this company are offering a cash prize of $200 to
any employee who develops a modification of the Basic Computer
Program that will double its operating speed. Design modification
entries should be submitted to the head of the Basic Program
Department prior to June 1. In the event that modifications are
submitted by more than one employee, the prize will go to the
employee who submits the design which, in the opinion of the Basic
Program Department, can be used most economically.

An engineer employed by the company read the notice on March 5, and
immediately began working on program modifications in his spare
time. On March 8, he wrote and signed a memo that said, “I accept the
stockholders' offer of a $200 prize for redesigning the Basic Computer
Program. I am hard at work on the project and expect to submit my
modification design within a week or two.” The engineer sent the note
to the head of the Basic Program Department by the interoffice
correspondence system, but it was somehow diverted and was never
received by the department head. The notice that was posted on March

240

1 constituted

(A) an offer for a unilateral contract.

(B) an offer for a bilateral contract.

(C) an offer for a unilateral contract that ripened into a bilateral
contract when the engineer wrote the memo on March 8 and
deposited it in the interoffice correspondence system.

(D) a preliminary invitation to deal, analogous to a newspaper

advertisement for the sale of goods.

6. When he moved into a new condo, the owner entered into a written
contract with a gardener. Pursuant to its terms, the gardener was to
perform certain specified gardening services in the yard of the condo
each week for a period of one year, for which the owner was to pay the
sum of $50 per month. The contract contained a clause that stated, “The
condo owner hereby agrees not to assign this contract without the
written permission of the gardener.” Three months after entering into
the agreement, the owner informed the gardener that he was selling the
condominium to the plaintiff, and asked the gardener to consent to the
owner's assignment of the contract to the plaintiff. Because the costs of
landscaping materials had increased dramatically in the last three
months, the gardener was glad for an opportunity to be relieved of his
obligations under the contract and refused to consent to the assignment.
The owner assigned the contract to the plaintiff anyway, but the
gardener refused to perform any further work on the yard. After
formally demanding performance from the gardener, the plaintiff hired
another gardener to do the same work for $75 per month, which was
the best price the plaintiff could negotiate.

In an action by the plaintiff against the gardener for breach of contract,
the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the gardener had no right to unreasonably

withhold consent to the assignment.

(B) the plaintiff, because the assignment was valid in spite of the

gardener's refusal to consent.

(C) the gardener, because the contract prohibited assignment by the

owner without the gardener's consent.

(D) the gardener, because the contract was for personal services.

241

7. On June 1, after arson fires had damaged several city buildings, the
city council voted to offer a reward to aid in apprehension of the
arsonists. On June 2, by order of the city council, signs were posted in
various locations throughout the city. The posters identified the
buildings that had been burned and stated: “$1,000 REWARD is
hereby offered by the city to any person furnishing information leading
to the conviction of persons responsible for setting fire to said
buildings.” A police officer employed by the city saw the posters on
June 5 and resolved to make a special effort to catch the arsonists.
Although he was not officially assigned to the case, he notified his
fellow police officers and his usual underworld informants that he was
especially interested in the case. As a result, another police officer and
an underworld informant passed information to the police officer that
they thought might relate to the arson crimes. The tip the first police
officer received from the other officer proved to be of no assistance,
but the tip he received from the informant led him to conduct a further
investigation. His efforts eventually resulted in the arrest of two men
who pleaded guilty to setting fires in public buildings. The first police
officer demanded that the city council pay him $1,000, but the council
refused.

If the police officer institutes a lawsuit against the city for the $1,000
reward offered in the signs posted on June 2, which of the following
would be the city's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The reward should go to the informant, since it was his information

that eventually led to the arrest of the arsonists.

(B) The reward was not accepted, since the arsonists were not

convicted but pleaded guilty.

(C) The police officer gave no consideration for the city's promise to
pay a reward, since he was already obligated to attempt the
apprehension of the arsonists.

(D) There was no enforceable promise by the city, since the offer was

for a gratuitous cash award.

8. A foreign country is an English-speaking republic on the continent of
Europe. Its unit of currency is the “dollar,” which is worth about 85
U.S. cents. While on a business trip in the United States, the plaintiff,
who owned a glue factory in the foreign country, entered into a written
contract with the defendant. According to the contract, the defendant

242

was to purchase 30 tons of liquid glue from the plaintiff, to be
delivered on or before July 10. The contract stated the total price of the
glue to be “NINE THOUSAND ($9,000) DOLLARS.” After receiving
the shipment, the defendant sent the plaintiff an international money
order for 9,000 of the foreign country's dollars. The plaintiff wrote to
the defendant, claiming that the agreement called for the payment of
9,000 U.S. dollars, but the defendant refused to make any further
payment. The plaintiff instituted an action against the defendant in the
United States and offered to testify that, prior to executing the written
memorandum, she and the defendant agreed that the price expressed in
the writing was to be in U.S. dollars.

If the defendant objects to the testimony, the objection should be

(A) sustained, since the oral agreement about which the plaintiff is

offering to testify was made prior to the execution of the written
memorandum of sale.

(B) sustained, only if the written memorandum was prepared by the

defendant.

(C) overruled, unless the writing is found to be a complete integration

of the agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff.

(D) overruled, because the evidence that the plaintiff is offering to
present does not modify or contradict the terms of the writing.

9. The plaintiff was fishing on her boat when she heard a call for help.

Looking around, she saw a man drowning and flailing his arms over his
head. The plaintiff jumped into the water and swam toward the man,
dropping her fishing gear into the lake and losing it in her effort to aid
the man. She grabbed the man by the hair and swam to the shore,
dragging him out of the water. The man was unconscious, but she gave
him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until he regained consciousness.
When the man opened his eyes, he said, “I know I can never repay you
for saving my life, but I promise to pay you $100 the first of next month
as a token of my gratitude.” A few days later, the man died from causes
not related to the incident.

The following month, the plaintiff made demand upon the man's
executor for the $100 that the man promised her and for an additional
$100, which was the value of the fishing gear that she lost in her
attempt to rescue the man. The executor rejected both demands. If the

243

plaintiff institutes an action for the value of her fishing gear against the
executor of the man's estate, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, on a theory of quantum meruit.

(B) the plaintiff, because danger invites rescue.

(C) the plaintiff, because the reasonable person in the man's position
would have offered to pay for the loss of the fishing gear in
exchange for the plaintiff's attempt to rescue him or her.

(D) the executor of the man's estate.

10. A woman's hobby was restoring and collecting antique automobiles.

After acquiring an antique automobile, she contacted a body shop about
having the car repainted. The body shop said that it would paint the car
for $700 and would sell the woman a new bumper for an additional
$150. Using an order blank from a pad that he purchased at a stationery
store, the body shop's owner wrote out all the terms of the agreement.
On a printed line marked “PAYMENT,” he wrote, “Paint job—$700,
payable $300 in advance and $400 on completion. Bumper—$150
payable on delivery.” Both the body shop's owner and the woman
signed at the bottom of the form. Which of the following statements
most correctly describes the obligations set forth in the writing signed
by the woman and the body shop owner?

(A) Payment by the woman of the initial $300 is a condition precedent
to the body shop's obligation to paint the car, and the body shop's
painting of the car is a condition precedent to the woman's
obligation to pay the additional $400.

(B) Payment by the woman of the initial $300 is a condition precedent
in form and substance to the body shop's obligation to paint the car,
and the body shop's painting of the car is a condition precedent in
form, but subsequent in substance to the woman's obligation to pay
the additional $400.

(C) Payment by the woman and painting of the car by the body shop are

concurrent conditions.

(D) Neither party's obligation to perform is conditioned upon

performance by the other party.

11. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as department manager
pursuant to a written contract. The contract was for a five-year term
and fixed the plaintiff's compensation at $2,000 per month. The

244

plaintiff's work was satisfactory, but two years after entering into the
contract with him, the defendant reorganized the company. As a result
of the reorganization, the plaintiff's department was eliminated, and the
defendant terminated the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff
advertised in the “jobs wanted” section of the newspaper, but he did
not find a job until six months after his discharge, when he went to
work for another company doing the same general sort of work that he
had been doing for the defendant and earning the same salary. In an
action by the plaintiff against the defendant for damages resulting from
breach of the employment contract, the court should give judgment to

(A) the defendant, since the plaintiff's position was eliminated.

(B) the plaintiff, for severance pay in a sum equivalent to two months'

salary.

(C) the plaintiff, in a sum equivalent to the salary that the plaintiff lost
between the time of his discharge and the time he began working
for the new company, plus the cost of advertising in the “jobs
wanted” section of the newspaper.

(D) the plaintiff, in a sum equivalent to the salary that the plaintiff
would have received during the balance of the contract term.

12. The plaintiff was the owner of a fleet of taxis that he leased to

independent drivers in return for 60 percent of the fares that they
collected. All the leases were scheduled to expire on December 31.
Because the cars in his fleet were beginning to look shabby, the
plaintiff decided to have them all painted during the first week of
January, before negotiating new leases with the drivers. At the
beginning of December, he called the defendant's auto-painting
company to inquire about his price for painting all the cars in the
plaintiff's fleet. The defendant said he would do the job for $150 per
car.

The plaintiff said, “I'm talking about 60 cars. That's a lot of business.
I'll give you the job if you'll do it for $125 per car.”

“I'd really like to have your business,” replied the defendant.

“See you the first week in January,” the plaintiff said.

On January 3, the plaintiff brought one of his taxis to the paint shop
and offered to make arrangements for bringing in the rest of the cars to

245

be painted. The defendant said that he had just obtained a contract to
paint some school buses and that he was too busy to do any work for
the plaintiff. The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim for damages
against the defendant.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the
only one true, would be most helpful to the plaintiff in his action
against the defendant?

(A) The defendant's statement, “I'd really like to have your business,”

implied a promise to paint all the cars in the plaintiff's fleet at $125
per car.

(B) The plaintiff relied on the defendant's statement by bringing the taxi

to the shop.

(C) Immediately prior to January 3, the plaintiff could have had the

taxis painted at another shop for $125 each, but immediately after
January 3, the lowest price he could find was $150.

(D) On January 3, when the defendant told the plaintiff that he was too
busy to do the work, the plaintiff offered to pay the defendant $150
per car and tendered payment of that sum.

13. When the plaintiff's uncle died, he left her a 10-story office building

that had a motion picture theater on its ground floor. The offices in the
building were all occupied when the plaintiff acquired title to it. The
motion picture theater was vacant, however, so she advertised for a
tenant. The defendant had researched the neighborhood and decided
that it was a good location for a pornographic movie theater. When he
saw the plaintiff's advertisement, he contacted her and said that he was
interested in leasing the theater. He did not tell her what type of films
he intended to show because he thought that she might be unwilling to
rent it to him for that purpose. On April 1, they entered into a written
rental agreement for the theater, occupancy to begin on May 1. On
April 15, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the showing
of pornographic films in the neighborhood where the theater was
located. As a result, the defendant advised the plaintiff that he was
canceling the rental agreement.

If the plaintiff sues the defendant for breach of contract, the court
should find for

(A) the defendant, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

246

(B) the defendant, under the doctrine of impossibility of performance.

(C) the defendant, because after the contract had been formed,
government action made its subject matter unlawful.

(D) the plaintiff.

14. A builder contracted to add a room to a homeowner's house for $3,000,
with the understanding that the materials used by the builder were to be
included in that price. The day before work was to begin, the
homeowner wired the builder, “The deal is off. Do not begin work.”
The builder subsequently asserted a claim against the homeowner for
breach of contract. The homeowner raised non-compliance with the
Statute of Frauds as a defense. Which of the following statements is
most correct about the application of the Statute of Frauds to the
contract between the homeowner and the builder?

(A) The contract was required to be in writing if the materials that
would have been required had a price in excess of $500.

(B) The contract was required to be in writing if, at the time of

contracting, the parties intended that the materials required would
have a price in excess of $500.

(C) The contract was required to be in writing if the materials that

would have been required had a price in excess of $500, and the
parties intended that the materials required would have a price in
excess of $500 at the time of contracting.

(D) The contract was not required to be in writing.

15. After the plaintiff said that the defendant owed him $3,000, the

defendant promised to pay $2,000, which the plaintiff agreed to accept
as payment in full. Subsequently, the defendant refused to make
payment, and the plaintiff asserted a claim for $2,000 based on the
defendant's promise. If it was the only one true at the time of the
defendant's promise, which of the following additional facts or
inferences would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
plaintiff?

(A) The defendant honestly believed that he owed the plaintiff $3,000,
but the plaintiff did not believe that the defendant owed him the
money.

(B) The plaintiff honestly believed that the defendant owed him $3,000,
but the defendant did not believe that he owed the plaintiff the

247

money.

(C) The plaintiff was threatening to institute a lawsuit against the

defendant for $3,000 plus costs and interest.

(D) The plaintiff had already commenced a lawsuit against the

defendant for $3,000 plus costs and interest.

16. A building contractor's daughter was about to celebrate her 21st
birthday, and the contractor wanted to give her a gift that would
express his sentiments for her. He was a wealthy and successful
contractor, but he had begun his career as an assistant bricklayer.
Instead of purchasing something for his daughter, he decided to give
her a gift with the labor of his hands. The contractor entered into a
written contract with the defendant. According to its terms, the
contractor agreed to build a brick fireplace for the defendant,
performing all the labor himself. In return, the defendant agreed to pay
the sum of $1,000 to the contractor's daughter on her birthday, February
12, upon completion of the work by the contractor to the defendant's
satisfaction. The daughter did not learn of the transaction until
February 12. Before signing the written contract, the defendant and the
contractor agreed orally that the defendant would make a reasonable
effort to obtain a loan to pay for the work, but that if the defendant was
unsuccessful in doing so by January 1, the agreement between them
would be of no effect. The defendant made efforts to obtain the loan but
could not do so. On January 1, the defendant informed the contractor
that because he was unable to obtain the loan, he was calling off the
deal. In an action for breach of contract brought against the defendant
by the proper party, will the defendant be successful in asserting as a
defense his inability to obtain a loan?

(A) Yes, because obtaining a loan was a condition precedent to the

existence of an enforceable contract.

(B) Yes, because a modification of a construction contract may be by

oral agreement.

(C) No, because the defendant is estopped from denying the validity of

the written agreement.

(D) No, because the agreement concerning the loan is an oral agreement
that was made prior to the writing and it contradicts the terms of
the writing.

17. Assume that the defendant in each of the following fact patterns objects

248

to enforcement of the agreement on the ground that it violates the
Statute of Frauds. In which of the following fact patterns is the
agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant LEAST likely to be
enforced over the defendant's objection?

(A) The defendant orally agreed to purchase a series of porcelain

figurines from the plaintiff to be delivered one per week for 15
weeks at a price of $100 per figurine. Prior to the first delivery, the
defendant advised the plaintiff that he was no longer interested in
receiving the figurines.

(B) The defendant orally agreed to purchase a hand-carved entry door
for the defendant's home with the defendant's coat of arms on it for
a price of $600. After the plaintiff completed the rough carving of
the defendant's coat of arms, the defendant changed her mind and
notified the plaintiff that she would not accept delivery of the door.

(C) The defendant's pleadings admitted making an oral agreement to
purchase a painting from the plaintiff for $900 but asserted as an
affirmative defense that the agreement was unenforceable under the
Statute of Frauds.

(D) The defendant orally agreed to a price of $1,200 for the purchase

of 100 lawn-trimmers manufactured by the plaintiff for resale in the
defendant's store. The plaintiff then sent the defendant a
memorandum signed by the plaintiff and outlining the terms of their
agreement. The defendant did not sign the memorandum or respond
to it in any way.

18. The plaintiff, a minor, purchased a used car from the defendant for

$1,200. The reasonable rental value of the car was $150 per month.
After she had owned the car for two months, the steering failed while
she was driving it, causing it to collide with a tree. Although the
plaintiff was unhurt, the car sustained $400 worth of damage. The
plaintiff returned the damaged car to the defendant and demanded her
money back, but the defendant refused to refund her money. If the
plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant, the court should award
her a judgment in the amount of

(A) $1,200 (the full purchase price of the car).

(B) $900 (the purchase price of the car less its reasonable rental

value).

249

(C) $800 (the purchase price of the car less the damage that it

sustained).

(D) nothing.

19. The seller and the buyer were neighbors who owned homes on

adjoining parcels of realty. They were both in the business of selling
art supplies, each operating an art supply store that engaged in friendly
competition with the other. The seller owned a garden tractor that he
used for cultivating vegetables in the backyard of his home. The buyer,
who wanted to plant a garden in his own backyard, sent the seller a
note in which he offered to buy the tractor from the seller for $500. The
seller responded on February 15 by sending the buyer a letter that
stated, “I will sell you my garden tractor for $600, and not a penny
less. To give you time to think it over, I promise to hold this offer open
until March 15.” On March 5, the buyer noticed a similar garden
tractor in the yard of another neighbor. He called that neighbor on the
phone and offered to buy it for $500, but he said, “Are you kidding? I
just bought it from [the seller] for $600.” On March 6, the buyer went
to the seller's store with $600 in cash, and said, “I've decided to buy
that tractor from you. Here's the money.” The seller refused the money
and told the buyer that he had already sold the tractor to the other
neighbor. If the buyer asserts a claim against the seller for damages
resulting from the seller's refusal to sell the tractor on March 6, the
court should find for

(A) the buyer, because the seller's offer of February 15 was irrevocable

until March 15.

(B) the buyer, because the seller did not notify him that he was

withdrawing his offer to sell the buyer the garden tractor until after
the buyer accepted it.

(C) the seller, because the buyer learned of the sale to the other

neighbor on March 5.

(D) the seller, because his letter of February 15 was a rejection of the

buyer's original offer to purchase the garden tractor.

20. The seller and the buyer entered into a written contract for the sale of
200 electric power drills. Although they orally agreed on a price, they
inadvertently failed to include it among the terms of the written
agreement. In an action for breach of the contract, the court should

(A) admit oral testimony to establish the price that the parties intended.

250

(B) refuse to enforce the contract if it is one that the Statute of Frauds

required to be in writing.

(C) conclude that the contract calls for the payment of a reasonable

price.

(D) disregard the writing since it fails to contain all the essential terms

of the agreement.

21. On May 15, after negotiation, a painter and a homeowner entered into a

written agreement for the painting of the homeowner's home. The
writing stated that the price was to be $300 plus the cost of materials,
that the work was to begin on June 2 and be completed by June 12, that
stucco portions of the house were to be painted yellow and wood trim
was to be painted brown, and that the written memorandum was a full
and final expression of the agreement between the painter and the
homeowner. During litigation between the painter and the homeowner
to enforce the contract, the homeowner offered to testify to the
following additional facts. Which is the LEAST likely to be admitted
into evidence over timely objection by the painter?

(A) Prior to signing the memorandum, the painter and the homeowner
orally agreed that the contract would have no legal effect if the
homeowner sold his house prior to June 2.

(B) Prior to signing the memorandum, the painter and the homeowner
orally agreed that the homeowner would use no paint without first
submitting it for the homeowner's approval.

(C) While signing the memorandum, the painter and the homeowner
orally agreed that any promises made by either of them during
negotiations were to be enforceable, even if they were omitted
from the memorandum.

(D) While signing the memorandum, the painter and the homeowner
orally agreed that the painter would spend no more than $10 per
gallon for paint.

22. On May 20, on a form provided by an air-conditioning company, the
defendant agreed to purchase from the company 100 described air-
conditioning units at a price of $250 each, FOB the company's factory.
The contract contained a clause that prohibited either party from
assigning its rights or obligations under the contract without the consent
of the other party. On June 1, the company's employees loaded the units

251

on a truck owned and operated by an independent trucking company.
When the loading was complete, the air-conditioning company phoned
the defendant that the shipment was on its way. Later that day, the
company executed a document that contained the following language:
“In consideration of $20,000 to me in hand paid by the plaintiff this
date, I hereby assign to the plaintiff all rights under my contract with
the defendant dated May 20.” On June 2, while en route to the
defendant's warehouse, the truck containing the air-conditioning units
overturned, and the entire shipment was destroyed.

The defendant did not consent to the company's assignment of rights to
the plaintiff. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the
plaintiff will probably recover

(A) the contract price of $25,000 (100 air-conditioning units at $250

each).

(B) the difference between the contract price and the market value of

the air-conditioning units.

(C) nothing, since recovery from the defendant would unjustly enrich

the plaintiff.

(D) nothing, since the contract between the defendant and the plaintiff

prohibited assignment.

23. A world-renowned artist's will left a collection of 30 of his paintings
to his niece, an art dealer. The paintings inherited by the niece were
untitled, but they were identified by the numbers 1 through 30. The
niece had a catalog printed containing photographs and descriptions of
each painting in the collection. On August 1, she sent a copy of the
catalog to another art dealer, with the following cover letter:

I  know  how  much  you  like  my  uncle's  work,  so  I'm  giving  you  an
opportunity to buy some of these paintings before I offer them to any
other  dealers.  The  price  is  $2,000  per  painting,  no  matter  how  many
you  buy.  Telegraph  your  order  within  two  weeks,  or  I'll  put  them  on
the market.

(signed)

On August 2, the art dealer sent the niece a telegram that said, “I
accept your offer to sell painting Number 30 for $2,000. I will come to
your gallery in two days to pick up the painting, and will pay cash at

252

that time.”

On August 3, after receiving the telegram, the niece telephoned the
dealer and said that because of favorable publicity that the collection
had received, she would not sell painting Number 30 for less than
$3,000. The dealer agreed on the telephone to pay $3,000 for painting
Number 30. Between August 1 and August 3 the fair market value of
the painting increased by $1,000.

On August 4, the dealer sent and the niece received a telegram that
said, “I accept your offer to sell your uncle's paintings 1 through 29 for
$2,000 each. I will pick up the paintings tomorrow, and will pay for
them at that time.”

On August 5, the dealer presented herself at the niece's gallery and
tendered payment of $2,000 each for all 30 paintings. However, the
niece refused to sell her any of the paintings except Number 30, for
which the niece insisted the agreed price was $3,000. The dealer left
without buying it, saying that the niece would be hearing from her
lawyer.

If the niece asserts a claim against the dealer for breach of a contract
to purchase painting Number 30 for $3,000, the court should find for

(A) the dealer, because her promise to pay $3,000 for the painting was

not in writing.

(B) the niece, because the fair market value of painting Number 30

increased by $1,000 between August 1 and August 3.

(C) the niece, because she relied on the dealer's promise to pay $3,000

for painting Number 30.

(D) the niece, because she had not received payment from the dealer

prior to their conversation on August 3.

24. On March 1, an aluminum siding contractor entered into a written

contract with the homeowner for the installation of aluminum siding on
the exterior of the homeowner's home. The contract called for
completion of the job by April 1 and contained a clause that prohibited
assignment by either party without the other party's written consent.
The contractor started work immediately upon the signing of the
contract. On March 15, the homeowner sold his house, assigning to the

253

new owner his contract with the contractor.

In which of the following fact situations is the plaintiff LEAST likely
to succeed in his action against the defendant?

(A) The contractor finished the job in a workmanlike manner on March
29 and demanded but did not receive payment. The contractor
instituted an action against the original homeowner for payment.

(B) The contractor finished the job in a workmanlike manner on March
29 and demanded but did not receive payment. The contractor
instituted an action against the new owner for payment.

(C) When the contractor learned of the home-

owner's assignment to the new owner, he refused to do any further
work. The original homeowner instituted an action against the
contractor for breach of contract on April 15.

(D) When the contractor learned of the original homeowner's

assignment to the new owner, he refused to do any further work.
The new owner instituted an action against the contractor for
breach of contract on April 15.

25. On August 1, a wholesaler of office supplies contracted by telephone
to sell 50 cases of typewriter ribbons to a business equipment retailer
at a total price of $450. On August 15, the wholesaler telephoned the
retailer and told him that because of a shortage of materials, the price
that the wholesaler had to pay for typewriter ribbons had increased
drastically. The wholesaler said that if he delivered the ribbons at the
price of $450, he would lose a great deal of money. He asked the
retailer to consent to a higher price, suggesting that the retailer pass the
increase along to his customers. After further discussion, the retailer
and the wholesaler agreed to change the price of the order from $450
to $650. On August 18, the retailer succeeded in purchasing 50 cases
of typewriter ribbons from another supplier for $500. On September 1,
the wholesaler delivered 50 cases of typewriter ribbons to the retailer,
together with a bill for $650. The retailer rejected the delivery.

In an action by the wholesaler against the retailer for breach of
contract, which of the following would be the retailer's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) The wholesaler's demand for more money was unconscionable,
since typewriter ribbons were available at a lower price.

254

(B) The August 15 agreement increasing the price was not in writing.

(C) The retailer's promise to pay $650 was unsupported by

consideration.

(D) An increase in the wholesaler's cost resulting from a shortage of

materials was foreseeable on August 1.

26. The seller was an importer of arts and crafts products from

Mediterranean countries, selling mainly to large department stores and
import shops. To keep his sales force down to a minimum, the seller
did most of his selling by sending catalogs describing products and
prices to prospective customers and taking orders by mail on forms
provided with the catalogs. The phrase “10 percent discount on COD
orders only” appeared on the order form and on each page of the
catalog. After receiving one of the seller's catalogs, the buyer decided
to order 1,000 Greek coffeepots for sale in her import shop. On April
25, she typed the following across the seller's order form: “Send
immediately 1,000 Greek coffeepots (Catalog #6047) at 10 percent
discount. Payment within 10 days of receipt and acceptance.” The
seller received the order on April 27. On April 28, the seller shipped
1,000 Greek coffeepots to the buyer, who received and accepted them
on May 2. On April 29, the seller wrote to the buyer, “I am shipping
pursuant to your request and will expect payment within 10 days. Since
discounts apply only to COD shipments, you are herewith billed at full
price.” The buyer received the letter and enclosed bill on May 3. On
May 4, the buyer sent the seller a check in payment of the amount
billed, less 10 percent.

When was a contract for sale of the coffeepots formed?

(A) On April 25, when the buyer sent the order to the seller.

(B) On April 27, when the seller received the order from the buyer.

(C) On April 28, when the seller shipped the coffeepots to the buyer.

(D) On May 2, when the buyer received the shipment of coffeepots.

27. After lengthy negotiations, the plaintiff purchased a car from the

defendant, a car dealer. The plaintiff was driving it the following day
when the brakes failed due to a defect that existed at the time the
defendant delivered the car to the plaintiff. As a result, the car collided
with a pole and was damaged. The plaintiff asserted a claim against
the defendant for damages resulting from breach of the implied

255

warranty of merchantability. Which one of the following additional
facts, if it were the only one true, would be most likely to result in a
judgment for the defendant?

(A) At the time of the sale, both the defendant and the plaintiff signed a

document stating that the car was being sold “as is.”

(B) The car that the plaintiff bought from the defendant was a used car.

(C) The defect that caused the brakes to fail could not have been
discovered by reasonable inspection prior to the sale.

(D) The plaintiff purchased the car in reliance on the advice of a
mechanic whom she hired to inspect it prior to making the
purchase.

28. The defendant, who broke his leg falling from a ladder, was treated by
a doctor. At the time treatment began, the defendant explained that he
was short of cash, but that his treatment was covered by group
insurance. The doctor agreed to wait for his fee until the insurance
company made payment and offered to bill the insurance company
directly for the services that he rendered to the defendant. The
defendant provided the doctor with claim forms from the company that
insured the defendant's union. The doctor filled out the form, had the
defendant sign a portion of it authorizing the insurance company to
make payment directly to the doctor, and submitted the form to the
company. Because of an error by employees of the insurance company,
the payment was sent to the defendant, who failed to make any payment
at all to the doctor.

If the doctor asserts a claim against the defendant to recover the
amount of the unpaid bill, the court will probably find for

(A) the doctor, because he is a creditor third-party beneficiary of the

group insurance policy that covered the defendant.

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
(B) the doctor, because the defendant impliedly promised to pay the

doctor for his services.

(C) the defendant, because the doctor agreed to accept payment from

the insurance company.

(D) the defendant, because the doctor billed the insurance company

directly.

29. A landowner wanted to open an amusement park on a parcel of real

256

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

estate that he owned. After negotiation, the landowner hired a
contractor to build a roller coaster and several other amusement
devices on the land according to specifications furnished by the
landowner. The landowner and the contractor entered into a written
contract by which the contractor agreed to begin construction on
August 1, to be finished with everything but the roller coaster by
November 1, and to complete construction of the roller coaster by
December 15. The contract price was $150,000, to be paid as follows:
$50,000 on August 1, $50,000 upon completion of everything but the
roller coaster, and the balance of $50,000 upon completion of the
roller coaster. The contractor began work on August 1, after receiving
$50,000 from the landowner. By November 1, the contractor
completed construction of everything but the roller coaster in
accordance with the specifications.

On November 1, the contractor demanded the landowner pay him
$50,000, but the landowner refused to do so. Which of the following
statements is most correct concerning the rights of the contractor?

(A) The contractor is entitled to damages limited to the sum of $50,000.

(B) The contractor is entitled to damages in the sum of $100,000.

(C) The contractor may refuse to perform any further work without

incurring liability for breach of contract.

(D) The contractor may not sue the landowner for breach of contract

until he completes construction of the roller coaster.

30. A landowner was suffering from a terminal disease and did not expect
to live much longer. She was the owner of a parcel of realty known as
Blackacre and wanted her son to have it. Blackacre was worth
$500,000, but it was subject to a non-assumable mortgage securing a
note with a balance of $100,000. For this reason, the landowner
offered to sell Blackacre to her son for $100,000. Her son said that he
would like to buy it, but that it would take him a while to raise the
money. Fearful that she would die before the transaction could be
completed and that her administratrix would be unwilling to sell the
realty to her son for that price, the landowner wrote and signed a
document that said, “In consideration of $20 paid to me by my son, I
hereby promise to convey my realty known as Blackacre to him for the
sum of $100,000 if he pays the entire purchase price within one
month.” Two days later, the landowner died. One week after that, her

257

son tendered the sum of $100,000 to the administratrix of the
landowner's estate, demanding that she convey Blackacre to him, but
the administratrix refused.

If the son instituted a proceeding against the landowner's
administratrix for an order directing her to sell Blackacre to him for
$100,000, the court should find for

(A) the son, because the document written and signed by the landowner

was a valid option contract.

(B) the son, because the document written and signed by the landowner

was intended to be a testamentary substitute.

(C) the landowner's administratrix, because $20 is not sufficient

consideration for a $100,000 option.

(D) the landowner's administratrix, because $100,000 is not sufficient

consideration for realty valued at $500,000.

31. The plaintiff, a minor who looked older than he was, wished to

purchase a motorcycle. The plaintiff went to the defendant's motorcycle
shop and looked at some of the models on display. Selecting a
motorcycle he liked, he began negotiating with the defendant. The
defendant offered to sell him the motorcycle that was on display in the
showroom, but the plaintiff said that he wanted a new one. The
defendant explained that the display model was the only one she had,
but she said that she was planning to order some new motorcycles from
the manufacturer anyway and would order one for the plaintiff if he
agreed to purchase it. The plaintiff and the defendant entered into a
written contract for the sale of a new motorcycle at a price of $1,000,
to be paid on delivery within two weeks. The following day, the
defendant ordered 10 new motorcycles from the manufacturer, and the
plaintiff purchased materials and began building a storage shed for the
motorcycle.

One week after contracting with the plaintiff, the defendant notified the
plaintiff that the new motorcycle was ready for delivery, but that the
defendant would not deliver it to the plaintiff unless the plaintiff either
proved himself to be over the age of majority or found an adult to act
as co-purchaser of the motorcycle. If the plaintiff immediately
commenced an action against the defendant for breach of contract, the
court should find for

258

(A) the defendant, because if she delivered the motorcycle to the

plaintiff, the plaintiff might subsequently disaffirm the contract and
demand the return of the purchase price.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff lacked contractual capacity.

(C) the plaintiff, because he purchased materials for and began

construction of a storage shed for the motorcycle in justified
reliance on the defendant's promise to deliver it.

(D) the plaintiff, because one who contracts with a minor is obligated

to perform.

32. On March 22, by a written memorandum signed by both parties, the

seller agreed to sell and the buyer agreed to buy a described parcel of
realty. The buyer and seller were both in the business of buying and
selling real estate. The contract called for closing of title on May 30
and fixed all other terms, but it did not indicate the price to be paid. On
May 30, the buyer tendered $60,000 cash, but the seller refused to
convey the realty. The buyer subsequently instituted an action against
the seller for specific performance of the contract and offered evidence
that $60,000 was the fair market value of the realty both on March 22
and on May 30. In defense, the seller asserted that the memorandum
failed to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. The buyer's
suit against the seller should

(A) succeed, because the buyer and the seller are both in the business

of buying and selling real estate.

(B) succeed, because under the UCC, a contract that is silent as to price

is presumed to call for payment of fair market value.

(C) fail, because the written contract did not fix the price to be paid.

(D) succeed, because there is likely evidence establishing that the

parties orally agreed that the price to be paid was the fair market
value of the realty.

33. A rescuer saved the life of a man's wife, who subsequently promised to

change her will to leave $500 to the rescuer. The wife later died
intestate, however, survived only by her husband. After the wife's
death, the husband executed a document that read as follows:

In consideration of my wife's promise to leave the rescuer $500, of the
rescuer's saving my wife's life, and of the rescuer's promise not to

259

assert any claim against the estate of my wife, I hereby promise to pay
the rescuer the sum of $500.

The husband died two months after signing the above agreement. The
rescuer submitted a claim for $500 to the administrator of the
husband's estate, but the administrator denied the claim.

Is the fact that the rescuer saved the wife's life sufficient consideration
for the husband's promise to pay him $500?

(A) Yes, because it is recited as consideration in the document that the

husband signed.

(B) Yes, because it materially benefited the husband.

(C) No, because the husband did not ask the rescuer to save his wife.

(D) No, because the value of the service rendered by the rescuer to the

husband was speculative.

34. A woman, who was dying, wanted to leave her house to her niece. The
woman's will left the house to her husband. Because the woman was
unlikely to live long enough for a new will to be drafted, her husband
promised her that if she kept the will the same, he would leave the
niece enough money in his will to make up for the niece not getting the
house. The woman died, and the husband failed to make any changes to
his will. The niece then sued his estate for the value of the house. Will
she recover?

(A) No, because she is not a creditor beneficiary of the agreement

between the wife and her husband.

(B) No, because a will speaks on death, and neither the wife nor the

husband ever changed theirs.

(C) Yes, because she was an intended beneficiary of the agreement

between the wife and her husband.

(D) Yes, because she was a donee beneficiary of the agreement

between the wife and her husband.

35. In preparation for an annual convention that was to be held on January
9, the buyer ordered 500 ballpoint pens from the seller at a total price
of $285, paying for them in advance. Because the pens were to be
given to conventioneers as souvenirs, they were to be imprinted with
the name and slogan of the association and were to be delivered to the

260

buyer on or before January 8. The seller and the buyer entered into a
written contract containing the above terms on November 16. The
seller tendered 475 ballpoint pens to the buyer on January 8.

Which of the following correctly states the legal relationship between
the buyer and the seller on January 8?

(A) The buyer must accept the tendered delivery of 475 pens but may
successfully sue for damages resulting from breach of contract.

(B) The buyer may elect to accept the tendered delivery of 475 pens but

may not successfully sue for breach of contract if it does so.

(C) The buyer may reject the tendered delivery of 475 pens but may
successfully sue only for the return of its advance payment if it
does so.

(D) The buyer may reject the tendered delivery of 475 pens and may
successfully sue for the return of its advance payment and for
damages resulting from breach of contract if it does so.

36. A man texted his friend, “I really want to sell my motorcycle. I would
consider $2,000 for it.” His friend immediately texted back, “I accept!
I'll give you a check immediately!” The friend then went to his bank
and had a cashier's check for $2,000 prepared. He also went out and
bought a motorcycle helmet, motorcycle leathers, and a shed in which
to store his new motorcycle. The next day when the friend showed up
for the motorcycle, the man refused to give it to him. If the friend sues
for specific performance, the court should find for

(A) the friend, because he accepted the man's offer.

(B) the friend, because he detrimentally relied on the man's offer.

(C) the man, because he merely made a statement of future intention.

(D) the man, because he was merely soliciting bids.

37. On June 1, the plaintiff, a licensed real estate broker, entered into a
written contract with the defendant. According to the contract, the
plaintiff was given the exclusive right to sell the defendant's home at a
price of $100,000 for a period of three months. The defendant agreed
to pay the plaintiff a 7 percent commission “upon transfer of title.” On
July 1, as a result of the plaintiff's efforts, a buyer agreed to purchase
the defendant's home at a price of $100,000. According to the terms of
the contract, the defendant was to deliver evidence of clear title prior

261

to July 20. At the defendant's request, an abstract company researched
the chain of title and delivered an abstract to the defendant on July 15
showing clear title. The defendant did not deliver the abstract to the
buyer, however, because his neighbor was unhappy with the prospect
of having the buyer move into the defendant's home and asked the
defendant to try to get out of the deal. On July 21, the buyer notified the
defendant that he would not go through with the transaction because of
the defendant's failure to deliver the abstract of title as agreed.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for a 7 percent commission based on
the defendant's contract with the buyer. Which of the following would
be the plaintiff's most effective argument in support of her claim?

(A) The plaintiff delivered a buyer “ready, willing, and able” to

purchase the defendant's property.

(B) But for a willful breach by the defendant, the buyer would have

taken title to the realty.

(C) The defendant and the buyer entered into a contract for the sale of

the defendant's realty as a result of the plaintiff's efforts.

(D) The defendant's refusal to deliver the abstract frustrated the

purpose of the contract between the defendant and the plaintiff.

38. The seller and the buyer entered into a written contract for the sale of

500 bicycles at a total price of $50,000. The contract required delivery
by the seller prior to June 1 and payment by the buyer within 30 days
after delivery. On May 15, the seller delivered the bicycles to the
buyer, who received and accepted them. On May 21, because the seller
was having cash flow problems, he telephoned the buyer, asking
whether the buyer could pay for the bicycles immediately. The buyer
said that he would pay by May 25 if the seller was willing to accept
$45,000 in cash as payment in full. The seller agreed, but by June 20,
the buyer had made no payment at all. The seller subsequently
instituted an action against the buyer for $50,000. The buyer admitted
the existence of the contract, the delivery of the bicycles, and his non-
payment; but he asserted that he was liable for only $45,000 because of
the agreement that he made with the seller on May 21.

Is the buyer's assertion correct?

(A) No, because the buyer did not pay $45,000 by May 25.

262

(B) No, because a promise to perform a preexisting obligation is not

valuable consideration.

(C) Yes, because there has been a valid novation.

(D) Yes, because there has been a valid agreement of accord.

39. A publisher mailed an offer to publish a writer's first book for

$25,000. The writer immediately mailed back her acceptance. The
acceptance was properly addressed with the correct amount of
postage. However, the post office lost the letter and the publisher never
received it. Is there a contract?

(A) No, because the post office lost the letter.

(B) No, because the publisher was excused from performance since he

did not receive the letter.

(C) Yes, because the acceptance was properly addressed with the

correct amount of postage.

(D) Yes, because the writer mailed her acceptance.

40. When the plaintiff was admitted to law school, her mother was so

proud of the plaintiff that she said, “If you successfully complete your
first year, I'll buy all your books for the following two years. In
addition, I'll give you $250 for every ‘A’ that you earn in your first
year.” The plaintiff made extra efforts to earn “A”s. The plaintiff's
mother died while the plaintiff was in her first year of law school, but
the plaintiff succeeded in earning two “A”s in her first year, and
completed school in two additional years. The plaintiff demanded that
her mother's executrix pay her $250 for each of the two “A”s that she
received in her first year, and pay for the books that she had purchased
in her second and third year, but the executrix refused.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the executrix for $500 for the
two “A”s that she received in her first year of law school, will the
plaintiff's claim be successful?

(A) No, because she was already obligated to use her best efforts while

in law school.

(B) No, because the plaintiff's mother died before the plaintiff received

the “A” grades.

(C) Yes, because prior to her mother's death, the plaintiff made extra

263

efforts in an attempt to earn “A”s.

(D) Yes, because the plaintiff got into law school.

41. In a transaction involving the sale of a bicycle, which of the following

persons is NOT a merchant under the UCC?

(A) The owner of a bicycle store who sells her own personal bicycle
after using it for 14 months by placing an advertisement under the
heading “Used Merchandise” in the classified section of the
newspaper.

(B) The owner of an automobile dealership who buys a bicycle for use
by employees of the dealership's parts department in making
deliveries.

(C) A bicycle mechanic who buys a new bicycle from a retail store to

give as a gift to his nephew.

(D) The owner of a messenger service who employs a full-time bicycle
mechanic to maintain bicycles used in her business, and who sends
the mechanic to inspect a new bicycle before buying it for use by
messengers in her employ.

42. The defendant was the owner and operator of a summer resort located
at a high elevation in the northern part of the country. Because the hotel
was open only during the summer, the defendant usually employed a
single resident caretaker to live and work at the hotel during the winter
months. On August 1, after applying for the job of winter caretaker, the
plaintiff entered into a valid written contract with the defendant.
According to its terms, the plaintiff was to take up residence at the
hotel on October 1, and to remain in residence until the following
April 1, at which time the defendant was to pay him $10,000. During
the plaintiff's period of residence, he was to receive free room and
board and to perform certain maintenance tasks. On August 15, the
plaintiff enlisted in the U.S. Navy, his period of service to begin on
September 25 and to continue for three years. Mention of the plaintiff's
enlistment appeared in the “Hometown Gossip” section of a local
newspaper and was seen by executives of the defendant. The defendant
immediately began seeking another winter caretaker and hired another
caretaker on September 15, entering into a valid written contract with
him on that date that contained terms identical to those in the contract
with the plaintiff.

264

On September 20, the plaintiff failed the physical examination
performed by Navy physicians and was rejected for naval service.
The plaintiff reported for work at the hotel on October 1 but was
advised that his services were not required.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from breach of contract, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, since he was ready, willing, and able to perform as

agreed on October 1.

(B) the plaintiff, since he never informed the defendant that he would

not be reporting to work as agreed.

(C) the defendant, since the plaintiff's enlistment was an anticipatory

repudiation of his contract with the defendant.

(D) the defendant, since the defendant hired another caretaker in

reliance on the reasonable belief that the plaintiff would be unable
to perform as agreed.

43. On May 1, the defendant hired the plaintiff to reshingle the roof of his
house at an agreed price of $5,000, to be paid within 10 days after
completion, and with all work to be completed by July 1. The plaintiff
began work on May 2 and worked diligently until May 15. At that time,
the plaintiff had performed services that were worth $1,500, and which
increased the value of the defendant's house by $1,500. On May 16,
through no fault of either party, the house caught fire and was totally
destroyed. Although the proceeds that the defendant received from his
fire insurance policy were sufficient to cover the cost of building a
new house, the defendant decided to sell the property instead. The
plaintiff demanded payment under the contract, but the defendant
refused to pay.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim for payment against the defendant, a
court should award judgment to the plaintiff in the sum of

(A) $5,000, since it was the price on which the plaintiff and the

defendant agreed.

(B) $1,500, since it was the value of the plaintiff's work.

(C) $0, since the defendant derived no benefit from the plaintiff's work.

(D) $5,000, because the defendant could have rebuilt the house with the

265

proceeds from the fire insurance policy.

44. At the age of 14, the plaintiff designed a program for a computer game.

He demonstrated the program to the defendant, a company in the
business of marketing computer software. The defendant executives
were so impressed by the program designed by the plaintiff that they
hired him as a game program consultant at a salary of $30,000 per
year. In addition, they offered to purchase marketing rights to the game
by a separate contract. According to the terms of the contract that they
offered, the defendant would have the exclusive rights to copy and
market the program for the game and would pay the plaintiff 30 percent
of all revenues derived from the exercise of those rights. After
consulting with his parents and their attorney, the plaintiff accepted the
defendant's offer and signed the contract. Three months later, before the
defendant had begun marketing the plaintiff's game program, the
plaintiff needed cash to purchase expensive computer equipment. For a
large cash payment, he assigned his rights under the contract to his
friend. His friend intended to inform the defendant of the assignment
but neglected to do so. One month later, the plaintiff assigned the same
rights to another software company as security for a credit purchase of
additional computer equipment. The other company was unaware of the
assignment to the plaintiff's friend and never notified the defendant that
the plaintiff had assigned the rights to it. Two months later, the
defendant began marketing the game, realizing high profits from its
sale. Although the plaintiff has demanded payment pursuant to the terms
of his contract, the defendant has refused to make any payments.

If the plaintiff commences an action against the defendant for royalties
equivalent to 30 percent of the revenues generated by the sale of the
game, which of the following would be the defendant's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff was a minor at the time he contracted with the

defendant.

(B) The plaintiff has made at least one effective assignment of the

contract rights.

(C) Neither the friend nor the other company notified the defendant

about the assignment from the plaintiff.

(D) An assignment of wages is invalid.

45. A woman and her sister lived together in the woman's house in the

266

town of Wildwood. On March 1, the woman called her daughter on the
telephone and said that she was beginning to have premonitions of her
own death. The woman said that she was willing to deed her home to
her daughter while she was alive rather than put her daughter through
probate expenses. The woman said, however, that she would do so
only if her daughter agreed to permit her aunt to stay in the house for
the rest of her life and to permit her brother, who resided in another
state, to live in the house for as long as he wanted if he should ever
decide to come to Wildwood. The daughter promised to do so, and on
March 15, the woman deeded the home to her as agreed. At the time,
the home had a value of $100,000. The daughter called her brother on
March 10, and told him that their mother had deeded her the house but
did not tell him about her promise to allow her brother to live there.
On March 15, the aunt wrote to the brother:

“I don't think that either your mother or I have much longer to live, and
we both miss you terribly. If you agree to come and live here in
Wildwood for as long as either of us lives, I will leave you my entire
estate.

Love,

(signed)

On March 17, the brother called his sister and told her about the note
that he had received from their aunt. He said that he was thinking of
moving to Wildwood, and that if his sister promised to allow him to
live in the house that their mother had deeded to her until their aunt
died, he would give her 50 percent of the inheritance. The daughter
agreed, and her brother immediately wrote to their aunt, telling her that
he was moving to Wildwood in response to her offer. Their aunt
received the brother's letter on March 20. The brother made
arrangements to move to Wildwood, and did so, at an expense of
$800. Both their mother and their aunt died on March 22, but the
brother did not learn of their deaths until he arrived in Wildwood on
March 24. At that time, his sister refused to allow him to move into the
house.

The brother instituted an action against his sister for damages resulting
from her refusal to allow him to move into the house, and the only
defense asserted by the sister was that her promises were not in

267

writing. Which of the following would be the sister's most effective
argument in support of her position?

(A) Her promises to her mother and her brother were promises to

create an interest in land.

(B) It was possible that the promise that she made to her mother and her

brother would not be performed within a year.

(C) The house had a value in excess of $500.

(D) She received no consideration from her brother for either promise.

46. A painter entered into a contract to paint the homeowner's house for

$5,000. After painting the doors and the trim, the painter got a job offer
in a different state that he had to accept immediately or would lose. He
asked the homeowner if he could get out of the agreement, and the
homeowner, realizing the spot the painter was in, agreed. The painter
then asked if he could be paid for the amount of painting he did do. The
homeowner refused. Can the painter sue to recover the value of the
partial performance he rendered?

(A) No, because the painter was the one who requested to end the

agreement.

(B) No, because there was a mutual rescission of the contract.

(C) Yes, because the homeowner received value from the painter.

(D) Yes, because the painter was entitled to be paid for his part

performance.

47. The defendant, a manufacturer of widgets, entered into a valid written
contract that called for the sale of 2,000 widgets to the plaintiff at a
price of $10 per widget. Several weeks prior to the date set for
delivery, the defendant telephoned the plaintiff and advised her that
because of difficulty in locating a sufficient supply of frammis rods, the
defendant would be unable to deliver more than 1,000 widgets. After
discussion, the plaintiff agreed to accept 1,000 widgets at $10 per
widget instead of 2,000 as originally agreed. After the defendant
delivered 1,000 widgets, however, the plaintiff brought an action
against him for damages resulting from breach of contract. In
adjudicating the plaintiff's claim, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because her agreement to accept 1,000 widgets was

not in writing.

268

(B) the plaintiff, because her promise to accept 1,000 widgets was not

supported by consideration.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff agreed to accept 1,000 widgets.

(D) the defendant, because there has been an accord and satisfaction.

48. A man and the plaintiff were neighbors in a recently created

subdivision. Since both wanted to have landscaping work done, they
decided to join forces in hopes of getting a better price. They hired a
landscaper to plant grass and shrubs in their yards, directing him to bill
each of them for the labor and materials attributable to his separate
realty. After the landscaper completed the work, he submitted his bills
to the man and the plaintiff, who paid them immediately. The following
week, however, the man concluded that the landscaper had erroneously
billed him for some work done on the plaintiff's land. He showed his
calculations to the plaintiff, asking that the plaintiff reimburse him for
the amounts that he claimed to have paid on the plaintiff's account. The
plaintiff was certain that his neighbor was incorrect, but because he
did not want to come to bad terms with his new neighbor, he offered to
hire a gardener to keep the man's lawn mowed and trimmed for the next
two years. The man agreed to accept the offered services in lieu of
payment.

The plaintiff hired the defendant to maintain his lawn and the man's
lawn for the next two years, agreeing to pay him $50 per month for
certain specified services. The plaintiff and the defendant signed a
memorandum of agreement, and the plaintiff gave a photocopy of it to
his neighbor. Two months later, the plaintiff sold his house. At the
closing of title, the plaintiff handed the new homeowner the original
memorandum of his agreement with the defendant and executed an
assignment to the new homeowner of his rights thereunder. The
defendant continued rendering services as agreed for an additional six
months, receiving a check for $50 from the new homeowner each
month. Then, the defendant notified the man and the new homeowner
that he would no longer be able to work on their lawns. The man
wrote to the plaintiff and the new homeowner, demanding that they
make arrangements to have his lawn maintained for the remaining 16
months pursuant to his agreement with the plaintiff, but neither
responded.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for breaching their agreement

269

regarding maintenance of the lawns. Which one of the following facts
or inferences, if it were the only one true, would furnish the
defendant's most effective argument in defense against the plaintiff's
claim?

(A) There are equally competent gardening services in the area which,
for $50 per month, would perform work comparable to that which
the defendant agreed to perform.

(B) The value of labor and materials used in lawn maintenance has

increased dramatically since the signing of the memo.

(C) The agreement between the man and the plaintiff was oral.

(D) The defendant's inability to work on the lawns was the result of a
serious heart attack that led his doctors to advise him against ever
working again.

49. In response to an advertisement that he saw in the newspaper, the

homeowner telephoned the contractor and asked him to come to the
homeowner's home to estimate the cost of providing and installing new
aluminum screens for all the homeowner's windows. After taking
measurements, the contractor returned to his shop and prepared a
written estimate, in which he said that he would do the entire job for
$350. When the homeowner received the contractor's written estimate,
he wrote across it with a red felt-tipped pen, “I'll pay $300, but not a
penny more,” and mailed it to the contractor. When the contractor
received the estimate with the homeowner's statement written on it, he
wrote on the estimate, “I'll do it for $325.” He sent the estimate back to
the homeowner on September 5, but on September 12, having received
no response, he sent the homeowner a note that said, “All right, you
win. I'll do the job for $300. Unless I hear from you to the contrary, I'll
be there with the new screens on September 28. Signed, the
contractor.”

The homeowner received the note on September 14, but made no
response. On September 28, without the homeowner's knowledge and
while the homeowner was at work, the contractor went to the
homeowner's home and installed new aluminum window screens.

Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship
between the homeowner and the contractor AFTER installation of the
window screens on September 28?

270

(A) A contract was formed when the homeowner failed to respond to
the contractor's letter of September 12 within a reasonable time
after he received it.

(B) A contract was formed when the contractor began to install the

screens on September 28.

(C) A quasi-contract was formed when the contractor finished installing
the screens on September 28, obligating the homeowner to pay a
price equivalent to their reasonable value.

(D) No contractual relationship existed between the homeowner and the

contractor.

50. The defendant signed a five-year contract with the plaintiff. According

to the contract, the plaintiff would bag apples produced in the
defendant's orchard. There was a fixed price for each pound bagged,
with a minimum of 5,000 pounds to be bagged each year. A liquidated
damages clause provided that if the defendant requested less than the
5,000-pound minimum, the defendant would still pay the per-pound
bagging price for each pound by which the defendant's order was less
than the minimum. This was so regardless of whether the plaintiff was
required to do any work. In the second year, the defendant requested
significantly less than the 5,000-pound minimum of bagged apples. If
the plaintiff sues for breach and requests damages based on the
liquidated damages clause, the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the liquidated damages clause is a poor

estimate of actual losses.

(B) the defendant, because the liquidated damages clause was an

unenforceable penalty.

(C) the plaintiff, because the liquidated damages clause was a
reasonable estimation of damages under the contract.

(D) the plaintiff, because damages in this situation would be difficult to

calculate.

51 A woman knew that a local writer often gave private lessons in memoir
writing for $50 an hour. The market rate for such courses was closer to
$30 an hour, but the writer had already published two memoirs and
was somewhat famous. One day, the woman ran into the writer at the
grocery store. The woman told the writer how much she admired her
memoir writing. The writer then said, “I can come by your house

271

tomorrow to give you some lessons.” The woman said nothing. The
next day, the writer showed up at the woman's house and the two of
them worked on some of the woman's writing for an hour. For four
weeks, the writer showed up at the woman's house at the same time, on
the same day, and the two of them worked for an hour. At the end of the
month, the writer asked the woman to pay her. How much does the
woman owe?

(A) Nothing, because the woman never agreed to pay the writer.

(B) $120, the fair market value of the writer's lessons since the two of

them never had a formal agreement.

(C) Nothing, because by showing up at the woman's house, the writer

was making a gratuitous gift.

(D) $200, since this represented the writer's standard fee.

52. A boxer, the son of a poor family, grew up on his family's small farm
just outside of town. Despite the handicaps of poverty and lack of
education, the boxer eventually became the world's heavyweight
boxing champion. Proud of the boxer's accomplishments, the town
council voted to erect a statue commemorating the boxer's victory over
his social and economic disadvantages. Pursuant to town ordinances
and regulations, bids were accepted from several sculptors, including
the plaintiff. Because the plaintiff's work was relatively unknown, she
attempted to make her bid more attractive to the council by including a
guarantee that her work would be satisfactory. On February 1, the town
council entered into a written contract with the plaintiff, hiring her to
create the statue, and agreeing to pay her $5,000 upon its installation
on the steps of the town hall on or before June 30. A clause in the
contract provided, “It is expressly understood that the personal
satisfaction of the Mayor is a condition precedent to the council's
obligation to make payment hereunder. Upon completion of the statue,
it shall be made available for inspection by said mayor. If said mayor
is unsatisfied with the work, he shall notify the plaintiff immediately,
and the contract shall be canceled without liability of any party.”

The plaintiff sculpted a likeness of the boxer in farmer's overalls with
his hands in boxing gloves clasped victoriously over his head, which
she completed on June 10. The boxer had been arrested in another
state on May 30, however, and charged with possession of a
dangerous drug. His trial was scheduled for September 10. The town

272

council was fearful that the boxer would be convicted and that the
statue would embarrass the town.

The mayor went to the plaintiff's studio on June 11 after receiving
notice that the statue was ready for inspection. When he arrived, the
statue was covered with a canvas tarpaulin. When the plaintiff
removed the cover, the mayor said, “It's too small. The deal is off.”
The mayor truly believed the statue was too small, even though he was
also fearful of the conviction. The plaintiff subsequently demanded
that the town council pay for the statue, but the council refused. In an
action by the plaintiff against the town council, the court should find
for

(A) the plaintiff, because a reasonable person would have found the

plaintiff's work to be satisfactory.

(B) the plaintiff, because the mayor was fearful that the statue would

embarrass the town if the boxer was convicted.

(C) the town council, because the contract gave the mayor the absolute

right to reject the plaintiff's finished work.

(D) the town council, because the mayor actually believed that the

statue was too small.

53. The plaintiff worked for a corporation for 40 years. The corporation
told the plaintiff that the plaintiff would be given the right to retire at
any time with a lifetime pension. The plaintiff continued to work for a
few more years, then retired after downsizing her home so that her
expenses could be covered by the pension. She received the pension
for several years. After the founder of the corporation died, the
corporation stopped paying the pension. The plaintiff then sued. The
court should rule in favor of

(A) the plaintiff, because she chose to retire when she could have kept

on working.

(B) the plaintiff, because she received the pension in recognition of her

40 years of service.

(C) the plaintiff, because she worked for a few more years after

receiving the pension promise.

(D) the defendant, because there was no consideration supporting the

promise of the pension.

273

54. By a written contract, the plaintiff, the operator of a natural foods

store, agreed to purchase 200 pounds of large nuts from the defendant
at a specified price. A term of the contract provided that “payment
shall be due immediately on delivery and prior to inspection of the
shipment.” When a box containing the nuts was delivered, the plaintiff
paid the agreed price without inspecting its contents. One hour later,
the plaintiff opened the box and discovered that it contained small nuts
instead of large nuts. When the plaintiff telephoned the defendant to ask
that the defendant exchange the small nuts for large ones, the defendant
refused. The plaintiff repackaged the nuts and returned them to the
defendant. Subsequently, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the
defendant for breach of contract.

In considering the contract provision that required payment prior to
inspection, a court is most likely to hold that

(A) it is unconscionable and therefore not subject to enforcement.

(B) it constitutes a waiver of the buyer's right to inspect prior to

acceptance.

(C) it does not impair the buyer's right to inspect prior to acceptance.

(D) it was not enforceable when the contract was made, but since the

plaintiff did pay before inspecting the goods, he waived his right to
a preacceptance inspection.

55. The buyer and the seller were members of the graduating class of a
college. The buyer, who was planning to go to law school, told the
seller that he might need some law books. The seller had recently
inherited a law library, so he compiled a list of the books in the
collection and mailed it to the buyer on July 5 with a note that said,
“Interested in buying?” The buyer wrote the following letter on a copy
of the booklist and mailed it to the seller on Tuesday, July 8:

Dear seller,

I  will  buy  your  law  library  consisting  of  the  books  on  this  list  for
$2,600  cash  if  you  deliver  the  books  to  my  home  by  the  time  I  start
law  school  in  mid-September.  I  promise  to  hold  this  offer  open  until
September 1.

Yours truly,

274

[signed] the buyer

In the buyer's letter of July 8, what was the legal effect of the
statement, “I promise to hold this offer open until September 1”?

(A) The language did not prevent the buyer from revoking the offer.

(B) At common law, the language creates an irrevocable option in the

seller's favor.

(C) Under the UCC, the buyer was prevented from revoking the offer

until September 1.

(D) The language created an option in favor of the seller, subject to the

condition that the buyer actually begin law school.

56. Which of the following is most likely to be regarded as valid

consideration for a man's oral promise to pay his neighbor $1,000?

(A) The fact that his neighbor had saved the man's house from a fire the

day before the man's promise was made.

(B) The fact that at the same time the man made the promise to pay, his
neighbor promised to deliver to the man fire-fighting equipment
valued at $1,000.

(C) The fact that after the man made the promise, his neighbor relied
upon it by committing himself to the purchase of fire-fighting
equipment at a price of $1,000.

(D) The fact that immediately after the man made the promise, his

neighbor sent the man a written memorandum of their agreement, to
which the man did not object within 30 days.

57. An airline agreed to buy all of its jet fuel requirements from a jet-fuel
supplier. The supplier committed to supply those requirements at a
price pegged to the industry-wide posted price for crude oil. Then,
because of a war, the price increased dramatically. The supplier
reneged on the agreement. The airline sued. The court should rule in
favor of

(A) the supplier, because the war was not foreseeable at the time of

contracting.

(B) the supplier, because the plaintiff was not bound to buy any goods

at all.

275

(C) the airline, because it bound itself to act reasonably and in good

faith in estimating the quantity of fuel it required.

(D) the airline, because a mere price increase would not invalidate the

agreement.

58. After the commercial success of a rock music group, its lead singer

entered into a contract with the defendant. According to its terms, the
singer, singing alone, was to record a song for the defendant. The
defendant was to pay $2,000 to the singer 30 days after the record was
made, whether or not it was ever commercially released. If the record
was released, the singer was to receive additional compensation
depending on the number of copies of the record that were sold.

The singer made the record required by the contract on March 1. On
March 15, the singer bought a piano, promising to pay for it when he
received payment from the defendant. As security for his promise, the
singer assigned to the piano seller his right to collect the $2,000 that
the defendant owed him for making the record. The piano seller
immediately notified the defendant of the assignment. On April 1, the
singer purported to assign the same right to his landlord to induce him
to refrain from instituting eviction proceedings based on non-payment
of rent. The landlord immediately notified the defendant of the
assignment. On April 20, the singer sued the defendant for non-
payment of the $2,000.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the
only true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
defendant?

(A) The singer was an infant at the time of all the transactions

described above.

(B) The singer made at least one effective assignment of the right to

collect the $2,000.

(C) The singer's performance at the March 1 recording session was so

bad that the record can never be commercially released.

(D) A statute in the jurisdiction prohibited the assignment of future

wages by employees.

59. In an agreement made on April 15, the plaintiff agreed to design a coat
of arms for the defendant and to fabricate a wooden door with the coat

276

of arms carved into it for the front of the defendant's home. The
defendant agreed to pay $650 for the door, but it was understood that if
the defendant was not completely satisfied with the coat of arms and
the door, he would be under no obligation to go through with the deal.
Before the plaintiff completed the door, the defendant came to the
conclusion that he did not really want a coat of arms. When the plaintiff
brought the finished door to the defendant, the defendant took a quick
glance at it. Although the coat of arms was properly designed and
carved, and although the door had been fabricated in a workmanlike
manner, the defendant said, “I just don't like it,” and refused to accept
it.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, which of the
following would be the defendant's best defense?

(A) The agreement was not in writing as required by the Statute of

Frauds.

(B) The agreement was an offer for a unilateral contract that the

defendant rejected by refusing to accept the finished door.

(C) The defendant's subjective satisfaction was a condition precedent

to his obligation to accept the door.

(D) Since the coat of arms was not yet associated with the defendant, it

was possible for the plaintiff to find another buyer for it.

60. Because its property was filling up with a lot of unwanted recycled
plastic it didn't want to pay to have removed, a landfill gave a
construction firm free recycled plastic for use in its construction work.
All the firm had to do was come to the landfill and pick it up. The
plastic turned out to be defective, and the firm sued the landfill for
breach of contract. The landfill argued that there were no contractual
obligations to the firm because any promise it made was not supported
by consideration. The landfill argued it had merely made a gift of the
plastic on the condition that the firm come and pick it up. Can the firm
successfully sue for breach of contract?

(A) Yes, because the firm relied on the 
landfill's promise to its detriment.

(B) Yes, because the landfill wanted the firm to take the plastic and

benefited when it did so.

(C) No, because the landfill did not bargain for the firm's performance.

277

(D) No, because the unwanted plastic was a gift.

61. When the buyer's employer prepared to transfer him to its plant located
in Twin Oaks, the buyer contracted with the seller for the purchase of
the seller's home located in Twin Oaks. According to the contract, title
was to close and the home was to be vacant and ready for occupancy
by the buyer no later than April 20. Because the buyer was arranging to
move his family to Twin Oaks on April 20, at the buyer's insistence the
contract contained a liquidated damages clause. The clause provided
that if the house was not ready for occupancy on April 20, the seller
would pay the buyer $75 for each day thereafter that it remained
unavailable for occupancy. When the buyer and his family moved to
Twin Oaks on April 20, the home was not ready for occupancy. As a
result, the buyer and his family had to stay at a motel. On May 1, the
seller advised the buyer that he did not intend to go through with the
sale of this house. On May 10, the buyer instituted an action against the
seller for specific performance and damages.

With respect to the buyer's demand for specific performance, a court

(A) may find for the buyer, whether or not the liquidated damages

clause is held to be enforceable.

(B) may find for the buyer, because the liquidated damages clause is

unenforceable.

(C) may find for the buyer, because the liquidated damages clause is

enforceable.

(D) must find for the seller.

62. On June 11, the homeowner asked a local handyman whether the

handyman would be interested in painting the homeowner's house.
Following their conversation, they entered into the following
handwritten agreement, which the handyman wrote on the back of an
old envelope and which both signed:

The  homeowner  and  the  handyman  hereby  agree  that  the  handyman
will  paint  the  outside  of  the  homeowner's  house  for  $700  as  follows:
wood trim brown; doors and window frames green; siding yellow (two
coats).

The handyman painted the siding yellow and gave it two coats of
paint. He painted the wood trim brown and the doors and window

278

frames green, but gave them only one coat of paint. The homeowner
refused to pay unless the handyman gave the wood trim, doors, and
window frames a second coat. The handyman instituted an action
against the homeowner for $700. At the trial, the homeowner
attempted to testify that prior to executing the agreement, he and the
handyman agreed orally that the handyman would apply two coats of
paint to the wood trim, doors, and window frames, as well as to the
siding.

The trial judge should rule the homeowner's testimony

(A) admissible only for the purpose of establishing that the phrase

“(two coats)” is ambiguous.

(B) admissible for the purpose of establishing that the phrase “(two

coats)” is ambiguous and for the additional purpose of explaining
the ambiguity.

(C) admissible, because the agreement was written by the handyman.

(D) inadmissible, since the writing was a complete expression of the

agreement of the parties.

63. A man, who had been studying the writings of various mystical

philosophers, decided to sell all his worldly possessions, give the
money to charity, and wander about in the desert for a while to seek
insight and spiritual fulfillment. After about a month in the desert, the
man became ill and collapsed into unconsciousness. When he woke, he
was in the home of a retired surgeon who now lived like a hermit in the
desert, and who had found him in a helpless condition. As the doctor
fed soup to the man, the man said, “I have no money. I can never pay
you for any of this.” The doctor replied, “I'm not doing this for money.”

During the next week, the doctor fed the man and gave him medical
treatment. When the man was well enough to travel, the doctor
borrowed an old pickup truck from a distant neighbor and drove the
man to the house of the man's mother. The following week, after the
man told his mother what the doctor did for him, the man's mother
wrote the doctor: “In gratitude for the services that you rendered my
son, I hereby promise to pay you $350.00 when I get my dividend
check next month.” Before the dividend check arrived, however, both
the man's mother and the doctor died. The plaintiff, the doctor's
administrator, advised the mother's husband of the letter that his wife

279

had sent and indicated that he intended to make a claim against her
estate for $350.

After a discussion with the plaintiff, in which the plaintiff agreed not
to assert a claim against the mother's estate, the husband prepared a
document that read, “In consideration of services rendered by the
doctor to my wife's son, and of the plaintiff's promise to make no
claim against the estate of my wife, I hereby agree to pay $350.00 to
the doctor's estate.” After signing the document, the husband handed it
to the plaintiff. The husband never paid anything to the estate,
however, and the plaintiff instituted suit against him. The husband
defended on the ground that his promise to pay $350 was not
supported by consideration.

If the plaintiff's lawsuit against the mother's husband is successful, it
will most likely be for which of the following reasons?

(A) The document that the husband executed was an offer for a

unilateral contract that the plaintiff accepted by not making a claim
against the mother's estate.

(B) A judgment for the husband would result in his being unjustly

enriched.

(C) The husband is estopped from denying the validity of his agreement

with the plaintiff.

(D) The husband's agreement with the plaintiff was a compromise.

64. On September 10, the company, a well-known publisher of law books,
posted the following notice on the bulletin board at a law school:

As  an  incentive  to  research  and  scholastic  excellence,  the  company
announces  the  institution  of  an  award.  The  award  will  consist  of  a
complete set of the company's encyclopedias and will be presented to
the  student  in  each  graduating  class  of  the  law  school  who  attains  the
highest  overall  cumulative  Grade  Point  Average.  In  the  event  two  or
more  students  graduate  with  the  same  Grade  Point  Average,  the  dean
will  be  asked  to  select  the  winner  from  among  them  based  on  school
service and community involvement.

A student, who had just begun her final year at the law school, saw the
notice. Her grades already placed her toward the top of her class, but
she resolved to work harder than ever before in an attempt to win the

280

company's award. On September 20, she mailed a letter to the
company saying, “I accept your offer for the award and will do my
best to win it.” Her letter was received by the company, but it was lost
in the mailroom before any company officials had an opportunity to
see it.

Which of the following statements is most correct about the company's
notice?

(A) It was an offer for a unilateral contact.

(B) It was an offer for a bilateral contract.

(C) It was an offer for either a unilateral contract or a bilateral contract

at the offeree's option.

(D) It was an offer for a unilateral contract that ripened into a bilateral
contract when the student achieved the highest grade point average
in her class.

65. The defendant's 20-year-old son became ill while traveling. The

plaintiff, a youth hostel operator, let the son stay in one of the hostel's
rooms and nursed the son back to health. The plaintiff contacted the
defendant, who thanked the plaintiff and promised to pay the plaintiff
for any of his expenses. The plaintiff then sent the defendant a bill. The
defendant refused to pay. What result?

(A) There was an enforceable contract based on the plaintiff's promise

to pay the defendant's expenses.

(B) There was no enforceable contract because the defendant's promise

was not supported by consideration.

(C) There was an enforceable contract because the plaintiff

detrimentally relied on the defendant's promise.

(D) There was no enforceable contract because the plaintiff had a

moral obligation to give aid to the son.

66. The plaintiff was a manufacturer of sewing supplies, including thread,

needles, thimbles, and patterns. The defendant was an engineer
employed by the plaintiff in its product design department. Working at
home on his days off, the defendant invented a device that could be
used to increase the fuel efficiency of automobile engines. Without
telling his employer anything about it, the defendant obtained a patent
on the device and sold the patent rights for $100,000 to a motor vehicle

281

manufacturer. The plaintiff subsequently learned about the defendant's
invention and demanded the money that the defendant had received
from the manufacturer. In support of its demand, the plaintiff referred to
a provision of the defendant's employment contract that required him to
devote all his working time and energies to his employment. The
plaintiff's attorneys argued that because of this provision, the device
had been invented on company time, and that the patent rights therefore
belonged to the plaintiff. At a conference with the plaintiff's attorneys,
the defendant signed a promissory note for $50,000, payable to the
plaintiff, and the plaintiff agreed to abandon its claim. When the note
came due, the defendant refused to pay it.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant on the promissory
note, which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was
the only one true, would be most helpful to the defendant's defense?

(A) The employment contract was oral, although the Statute of Frauds

required it to be in writing.

(B) At the time the defendant signed the promissory note, the plaintiff

did not honestly believe that it was entitled to the patent rights, but
the defendant believed that the plaintiff was entitled to the patent
rights.

(C) At the time the defendant signed the promissory note, the plaintiff

honestly believed that it was entitled to the patent rights, but the
defendant did not believe that the plaintiff was entitled to the patent
rights.

(D) The plaintiff was not entitled to the patent rights under the

employment contract.

67. The plaintiff was a manufacturer of wood-finishing products with a

plant in the city. The defendant was a manufacturer of wooden furniture
with a factory located in the town. Pursuant to a written agreement, the
defendant agreed to purchase 50 gallons of wood stain from the
plaintiff at $5 per gallon, “FOB the defendant's factory.” The plaintiff
delivered the wood stain to a trucking company that loaded it safely
onto a truck in the city. While en route to the town, however, the truck
was hijacked by thieves. Its contents were never recovered.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for the agreed price
of the stain, which of the following comments is most correct?

282

(A) The plaintiff fulfilled her obligation to the defendant when the stain

was loaded safely aboard a truck in the city.

(B) The risk of loss passed to the defendant when the plaintiff

delivered the stain to the trucking company, although title to the
stain never actually passed to the defendant.

(C) The risk of loss did not pass to the defendant.

(D) The risk of loss was not on the plaintiff, since the loss was the

result of action by the public enemy.

68. When a landowner's daughter and a painting contractor's son

announced that they were getting married, the landowner and the
contractor decided to give them a house as a wedding present. On
January 1, the two men entered into a written agreement with each
other, pursuant to which they were to have a house built on the
landowner's lot, with the landowner and the contractor each paying
half the cost. It was further agreed that after completion of the house,
the contractor would pay the landowner $10,000 as his share of the
cost of the lot, and the landowner would convey the lot to their
children.

On February 2, the two men entered into a written contract with the
plaintiff, a builder. The contract called for payment in installments,
each payment being due upon completion of a specified stage of
building. In addition to its other terms, the contract contained a clause
providing that as each payment came due, the plaintiff would bill and
collect half of it from the landowner and half of it from the contractor.
In the contract, the plaintiff agreed that neither would be responsible to
him for more than half of the price.

On March 3, the contractor entered into a separate contract with the
plaintiff. Pursuant to this contract, the plaintiff hired the contractor as a
subcontractor to do all the painting required in connection with the
construction of the house. Because the house was being built for his
son, the contractor agreed to do the job for $3,000 although his work
was worth $5,000. The $3,000 was to be deducted from the final
payment that the contractor would owe the plaintiff for construction of
the house.

In April, the contractor became ill. Because he could no longer work,
he sold his painting business to his son, a competent and licensed

283

painting contractor, for about half of what it was actually worth. As
one of the terms of the contract of sale, the contractor's son promised
to do all the painting work on the house that the plaintiff was
constructing. The contractor notified the plaintiff of his agreement with
his son. When the house was ready to be painted, however, the
contractor's son informed the plaintiff that he would not paint it.

The plaintiff hired another painting subcontractor to do the job at a
price of $5,000 and asserted a claim for breach of contract against the
contractor's son. If there was an enforceable contract between the
contractor and his son, the court should find for

(A) the contractor's son, because there was no privity between the

plaintiff and him.

(B) the contractor's son, because a contract for personal services is not

assignable.

(C) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff was an intended donee

beneficiary of the contract between the contractor and his son.

(D) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff was an intended creditor

beneficiary of the contract between the contractor and his son.

69. The seller and the buyer had been friends for years. The seller was the
owner of a rare antique sports car, which the buyer had offered to buy
from her on several occasions but which the seller had never been
willing to sell. On the buyer's birthday, the seller and the buyer went
out for dinner and drinks. After dinner, the seller continued drinking
until she was somewhat intoxicated. During their conversation, the
seller said, “As a birthday present, I've decided that I'm going to sell
you my sports car for $500. And just to make sure that I don't change
my mind after I sober up, I'll put it in writing.” With that, she wrote on
a paper napkin, “We agree to the sale of my sports car to the buyer for
$500, COD,” and signed her name at the bottom. The buyer also signed
the napkin and put it in her purse. The following day, the buyer
tendered $500 in cash to the seller, but the seller refused to sell her the
car, claiming that she had been drunk when she made the offer.

In an action by the buyer against the seller for breach of contract,
which of the following additional facts, if it was the only one true,
would be most helpful to the seller's defense?

(A) The seller was so drunk when she wrote on the napkin that she did

284

not know the legal consequences of her act.

(B) The seller would not have offered to sell the car to the buyer for

$500 if she had not been drunk.

(C) The car was worth more than $500.

(D) The seller changed her mind about selling the car before the buyer

tendered the cash.

70. The defendant was the owner and operator of a store that sold exotic

birds and aviary supplies. The plaintiff was the owner and operator of
a pet shop in which dogs, cats, tropical fish, and exotic birds were
sold. The defendant kept a trained Amazon parrot on a perch near the
sales counter in his store. The bird had an extensive vocabulary and
did tricks on his perch to the great amusement of the defendant's
customers. The plaintiff wished to have the parrot for his own personal
pet and had attempted to purchase him from the defendant on numerous
occasions, but the defendant always indicated that he was unwilling to
sell. On January 5, the plaintiff again asked the defendant if he would
sell the parrot, to which the defendant replied, “I'd consider selling
him to you, but I don't even know what a bird with this parrot's training
is worth.” The plaintiff said that he would do some research to find
out, if the defendant would promise to seriously consider selling the
parrot for whatever they found the proper price to be. Based on their
conversation, the plaintiff and the defendant executed the following
document:

The defendant hereby agrees to sell to the plaintiff one trained Amazon
parrot for a price to be paid in cash and on delivery, said price to be
agreed upon after determining the reasonable value of a bird with the
parrot's training.

The plaintiff contacted five generally acknowledged experts in trained
exotic birds and received opinions from them regarding the parrot's
value that ranged from $700 to $1,000. When the plaintiff attempted to
buy the parrot from the defendant for $1,000, however, the defendant
indicated that he was unwilling to sell the parrot at any price.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for specific
performance of the agreement made on January 5, the plaintiff will

(A) win, because he offered to pay $1,000 for the parrot.

285

(B) win, but he will be required to pay a price for the parrot that the
trier of fact finds to be reasonable in light of expert and other
evidence presented at the trial.

(C) lose, since the January 5 document does not manifest an intent to be

bound.

(D) lose, since specific performance is not available in an action for

breach of a contract for the sale of a chattel.

71. The plaintiff was the owner of an air-conditioning repair company. His
employees did all the repair jobs, but the plaintiff himself did the
estimating and made price quotes to customers. The plaintiff
maintained a fleet of pickup trucks for use by his employees when
traveling to and from repair jobs, but the plaintiff usually drove his
own personal station wagon when going out to give a potential
customer an estimate.

On February 15, the plaintiff ordered a new station wagon from the
defendant, a new-car dealer. Prior to signing the sales contract, the
salesperson who sold him the car explained that the new car could be
obtained by the defendant only from the manufacturer. For this reason,
she said, it might be as long as two weeks before the defendant could
deliver the new car to the plaintiff. The plaintiff said that this would
be all right, but that he definitely needed the car by March 10 for use
in his business. Based on this discussion, it was agreed that the new
car would be ready for him no later than March 5.

Immediately following the signing of the sales contract by the plaintiff
and the defendant, the salesperson contacted the manufacturer's sales
department and placed the order for the plaintiff's car. She explained
to the sales representative at the manufacturer that she had contracted
to deliver the car to the plaintiff no later than March 5, and that if she
was unable to do so, she would probably lose the sale. The sales
representative assured her that the car would be delivered on time.

On March 4, the plaintiff sold his old station wagon because he
believed that he would be receiving the new one the following day.
The manufacturer failed to deliver the new car to the defendant until
March 30, making it impossible for the defendant to deliver it to the
plaintiff on time.

286

The plaintiff instituted an action for breach of contract against the
defendant, and he alleged damages that included lost profits resulting
from his inability to travel to the premises of potential customers for
the purpose of estimating jobs and selling his company's services.
Which of the following would be the defendant's most effective
argument in response to that allegation?

(A) At the time the contract was formed, it was not foreseeable that late

delivery of the automobile would result in business losses.

(B) Late delivery by the manufacturer made performance of the sales

contract by the defendant impossible.

(C) The plaintiff could have mitigated damages by renting another

vehicle or using one of the company pickup trucks while waiting
for delivery of the station wagon.

(D) Consequential damages are not available for the breach of a

contract of sale.

72. A licensed physician was driving home from the hospital where she
worked when she saw a pedestrian fall unconscious to the pavement.
The doctor stopped her car, examined the pedestrian, and diagnosed
that he was experiencing cardiac arrest. After attempting to render
medical treatment, the doctor carried the pedestrian to her car and
drove him to the hospital. There, she continued attempting to treat him
for an hour, after which the pedestrian died without ever having
regained consciousness. At the time she assisted the pedestrian, the
doctor reasonably expected to be compensated for her services. The
doctor subsequently sent the administratrix of the pedestrian's estate a
bill for medical services, but the administratrix refused to pay it.

The jurisdiction had a “Good Samaritan” statute. If the doctor asserts a
claim against the pedestrian's administratrix for the reasonable value
of her medical services, the court should find for

(A) the doctor, because at the time she assisted the pedestrian, she
reasonably expected to be compensated for her services.

(B) the doctor, because a contract was implied-in-fact.

(C) the pedestrian's administratrix, because the pedestrian received no

benefit as a result of the doctor's services.

(D) the pedestrian's administratrix, because the jurisdiction has a

287

“Good Samaritan” statute.

73. The plaintiff was a professional gambler who made his living by
accepting illegal bets on horse races and other sporting events.
Because he suspected that the police had discovered his operation, he
began looking for a new location for his illegal activities. Finding an
empty storefront building on Main Street, he contacted the defendant,
its owner. On December 12, they entered into a lease of the premises
for a six-month period. According to the lease, the plaintiff's
occupancy was to begin on the first of January, at a rent of $200 per
month. The plaintiff paid the first month's rent upon signing the lease.

On December 17, the plaintiff was arrested on charges of illegal
bookmaking. He pleaded guilty and received a nine-month sentence.
The following day, his attorney advised the defendant that the plaintiff
would not be moving into the leased premises after all. The defendant
agreed to release the plaintiff from the lease and immediately rented
the premises to another tenant for $300 per month, occupancy to begin
on December 20. When the plaintiff was released from prison nine
months later, he demanded that the defendant return his $200. The
defendant refused on the ground that the contract that the plaintiff had
made with her had an illegal purpose.

If the plaintiff institutes an action against the defendant, a court should
find for

(A) the defendant, since the courts will not aid either party to an illegal

contract.

(B) the defendant, since she and the plaintiff were not in pari delicto

regarding the illegality of the lease agreement.

(C) the plaintiff, since the lease agreement was not illegal.

(D) the plaintiff, since his sentence to serve nine months in prison made

performance by him impossible as a matter of law.

74. The defendant, an 84-year-old woman, suffered from Parkinson's
disease. She asked the plaintiff, a woman who rented space in her
home, to quit her job so she could care for the defendant. The plaintiff
agreed and quit her job in return for the defendant's promise that when
the defendant died she would leave the house and surrounding farm to
the plaintiff. Three days after the agreement was made, the defendant
made an appointment to see her lawyer to change her will. However,

288

before she could keep the appointment, she fell ill and was
hospitalized. The plaintiff spent a lot of time with her at the hospital,
but a few days later, the defendant died. The plaintiff sued the
defendant's estate for specific performance of the promise to convey
the house and farm. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the plaintiff, because she gave up her employment and agreed to

take care of the defendant.

(B) the plaintiff, because the defendant showed her intent to honor the

agreement by making the appointment with her lawyer.

(C) the defendant's estate, because the house and farm are worth much

more than the services actually performed by the plaintiff.

(D) the defendant's estate, because a will speaks at death.

75. The buyer received an advertising brochure from the seller in the mail.
The brochure contained a photograph of a computer, and above it the
statement, “While they last. All computers on sale at 25 percent below
manufacturer's list price.” The buyer immediately contacted the
company that manufactured the computer pictured in the seller's
brochure and determined that the manufacturer's list price for the 410
was $1,000. She then sent her check for $750 ($1,000 less 25 percent)
to the seller with a cover letter that stated, “I hereby accept your offer
for the sale of a computer. My check is enclosed herewith.” The seller
threw the buyer's letter and check away.

The brochure that the seller sent the buyer is best described as

(A) an invitation for offers.

(B) an invitation for offers that ripened into an offer when the buyer

learned the list price for the computer.

(C) an invitation for offers that ripened into an offer when the buyer

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

relied on it by sending her check and cover letter.

(D) an offer for the sale of a computer.

76. A group of workmen signed contracts at a fixed rate to work on a ship
during the salmon-canning season, as the ship went from San Francisco
to Alaska and back. When the ship arrived in Alaska, the workmen told
the captain that they would not do any more work unless the captain
gave them a very substantial increase in salary. Since the captain had
nowhere to go to get replacement men, he agreed. The workmen then

289

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

worked on the way back to San Francisco. When the captain refused to
pay the extra money, the workmen sued. The court should rule in favor
of

(A) the workmen, because they relied on the captain's promise of an

increased salary.

(B) the workmen, because parties can renegotiate a contract based on a

change in conditions.

(C) the captain, because he agreed to the salary increase while under

duress.

(D) the captain, because the workmen had a pre-existing duty to work

on the way back to San Francisco.

77. The seller was the owner of a lot and building that contained two

residential apartments. The seller resided in the upstairs apartment and
rented the downstairs apartment to a tenant and his family on a month-
to-month basis. The buyer was interested in purchasing the realty from
the seller. After negotiations, the buyer and the seller entered into a
written contract that provided that the seller would sell the house to the
buyer for $60,000 and that delivery of title was to occur on or before
August 1. The seller promised that at the time title was delivered, the
upstairs apartment would be vacant and that the downstairs apartment
would be vacant within three months thereafter. The buyer promised to
pay $58,000 upon delivery of title, and the balance of $2,000 three
months after delivery of title. The contract provided that “The buyer's
obligation to pay $2,000 three months after delivery of title shall be
voided if the downstairs apartment has not been vacated by that time.”

Which of the following statements concerning the order of
performances is LEAST accurate?

(A) The seller's delivery of title on or before August 1 and the buyer's

payment of $58,000 are concurrent obligations.

(B) Vacancy of the upstairs apartment is a condition precedent to the

buyer's obligation to pay $58,000 upon delivery of title.

(C) Payment by the buyer of $58,000 is a condition precedent to the

seller's obligation to deliver title to the premises.

(D) Payment by the buyer of $2,000 is a condition subsequent to the

seller's obligation to have the downstairs apartment vacated within

290

three months after the delivery of title.

78. Article 2 of the UCC applies

(A) only to transactions in goods.

(B) only to transactions involving merchants.

(C) to all commercial transactions.

(D) only to transactions in goods or services.

79. After seeing the small airplane that the pilot was flying go down in

stormy seas, the pilot's wife stood on the shore screaming, “Oh, God,
won't somebody please save my husband?” Upon hearing her appeal
for help, the plaintiff went out in his rowboat and succeeded in
rescuing the pilot. The plaintiff subsequently asked the pilot's wife to
pay him for his trouble, but she refused.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim for payment against the pilot's wife on a
theory of promissory estoppel, which of the following would be the
pilot's wife's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff was an officious intermeddler.

(B) The value of the pilot's life is too speculative.

(C) No promise of payment can be reasonably inferred from the wife's

cry for help.

(D) There was no consideration for the wife's promise.

80. The buyer was a collector of antiques who had purchased many

expensive pieces from the seller, an antiques dealer. Knowing that the
seller was traveling to Europe, the buyer wrote to him on March 11, “If
you should come across a good piece in your travels, please purchase
it for me. I don't care about the cost.”

On April 17, the seller wrote to the buyer, “I have found an excellent
settee. The price is $15,000, but I think it's a good buy. Are you still
interested? If so, let me know if the price is acceptable to you.”

The buyer received the seller's letter on April 21, and, on that same
day, texted the seller, “Fifteen thousand is OK. Buy the piece on my
account.”

Soon thereafter, the seller sold the piece to another collector who

291

offered more money.

In litigation between the buyer and the seller, if a court determines that
the seller's letter of April 17 was not an offer, it will most likely be
because that letter

(A) was an acceptance of the offer contained in the buyer's letter of

March 11.

(B) did not specify the terms of payment.

(C) did not manifest a willingness to be bound.

(D) did not specify a manner of acceptance.

81. The defendant, who resided in the city, was the owner of a chain of dry
cleaning stores. Because his stores had been financially successful, he
began selling franchises. By the terms of his franchise agreements, the
defendant permitted franchisees to use the name of his store in return
for an initial fee of $50,000 and 10 percent of the gross revenues.

The plaintiff lived in a distant state. When she heard about the
financial success of the stores, she wrote to the defendant, asking him
to sell her a franchise to operate a dry cleaning store in her state.
Because the defendant had great affection for the plaintiff and wanted
her to live near him, he sent her a letter in which he said, “If you will
come and live here, I will give you a franchise to operate in the city
without any initial fee. All you will have to pay is 10 percent of the
gross revenues.”

The plaintiff immediately wrote the defendant to tell him that she was
coming to live in the city as he requested, and that she was looking
forward to operating a store there. After the plaintiff moved to the city,
however, the defendant told her that his contract with another
franchisee prevented him from giving her a franchise to operate a store
in the city.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for breach of
contract, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, on a theory of bargained-for exchange.

(B) the plaintiff, because she detrimentally relied on the promise made

by the defendant.

292

(C) the defendant, because his promise was for a conditional gift.

(D) the defendant, because his affection for the plaintiff is not sufficient

to support his promise to her.

82. The seller is a manufacturer of wall-coverings that he ordinarily sells
to retailers in boxes containing 10 packages per box. By a valid
written contract, the buyer agreed to purchase, and the seller agreed to
sell, 10 boxes of 107-Blue. When the boxes arrived, the buyer
inspected them and found that 2 of the boxes contained 109-Red
instead of 107-Blue. The buyer immediately notified the seller, who
informed the buyer that he no longer produced 107-Blue and had sent
the buyer his last 8 boxes. The seller said that he had sent 2 boxes of
109-Red as an accommodation, and that the buyer did not have to
accept them unless he wanted to.

Which of the following correctly states the buyer's rights regarding the
shipment?

(A) The buyer may reject the entire shipment.

(B) The buyer may reject the entire shipment, or accept the 8 boxes
containing 107-Blue and reject the 2 boxes containing 109-Red.

(C) The buyer may accept the 8 boxes containing 107-Blue and reject
the 2 boxes containing 109-Red, or accept the entire shipment and
collect damages resulting from its nonconformity to the terms of the
contract.

(D) The buyer may reject the entire shipment, accept the 8 boxes

containing 107-Blue and reject the 2 boxes containing 109-Red, or
accept the entire shipment and collect damages resulting from its
nonconformity to the terms of the contract.

83. By a valid written contract formed on May 7, the builder agreed to

construct a warehouse for the landowner. Pursuant to the terms of the
contract, the building was to be completed no later than November 30.
The agreed price was $60,000, of which the landowner was to pay
$20,000 when the construction was 50 percent complete and the
balance upon completion. The builder began work on May 11 and had
completed 25 percent of the construction by June 5, when the partially
finished structure was struck by lightning and completely destroyed in
the resulting fire. No payment had yet been made by the landowner to
the builder. On June 7, the builder notified the landowner that he was

293

too busy to rebuild the structure and that he would not continue to work
on the project. The landowner subsequently hired another contractor to
build the warehouse at a lower price and rejected all the builder's
demands for payment. If the builder asserts a claim against the
landowner, the builder is entitled to recover

(A) the difference between $60,000 and the price that the landowner

paid to have the warehouse built by another contractor.

(B) the reasonable value of the work performed by the builder prior to

the destruction of the structure by lightning and fire.

(C) 25 percent of $60,000 ($15,000).

(D) nothing.

84. When the defendant's employers transferred him to the West Coast, they
promised to pay all his relocation expenses, including any commission
that he might have to pay for the sale of his home. The defendant
contacted the plaintiff, a real estate broker, and entered into a written
contract with her on September 1. Under its terms, the defendant
agreed that if the house was sold to any buyer who made an offer
during the following two months, he would pay the plaintiff upon the
closing of title a commission equivalent to 6 percent of the actual
selling price of the house. In return, the plaintiff agreed to make
reasonable efforts to find a buyer for the house at a price of $80,000.

On September 15, after the plaintiff showed the defendant's home to
the buyer, the buyer offered to purchase it for $75,000, on condition
that title would close on or before December 1. On September 18, the
defendant accepted the buyer's offer. On September 19, the buyer gave
the defendant $10,000 as a deposit.

On November 15, the buyer notified the defendant that he had changed
his mind and would not go through with the purchase of the house,
agreeing to forfeit the deposit that he had paid in return for the
defendant's agreement not to sue for damages. The following day, the
defendant entered into a contract to sell the house to another buyer for
$80,000. The defendant subsequently rejected the plaintiff's demand
for payment.

If the plaintiff institutes a claim against the defendant for her
commission, she is entitled to collect

294

(A) $4,800 (6 percent of $80,000).

(B) $4,500 (6 percent of $75,000).

(C) $600 (6 percent of $10,000).

(D) nothing.

85. A trash collector contracted with the city to collect garbage. Although
the contract entitled the collector to $150,000 for five years, the
collector requested an additional $10,000 a year from the city council
because his operating costs had substantially increased due to an
unanticipated explosion of new houses. The city made the payments. A
citizen then sued to have the additional payments refunded to the city.
The court should rule in favor of

(A) the collector, because the city council agreed to the additional

$10,000 a year.

(B) the collector, because there was a valid modification of the

contract.

(C) the citizen, because the collector had a pre-existing duty to collect

the city's garbage.

(D) the citizen, because the collector took unfair advantage of the city

by requesting more money to pick up the trash.

86. The defendant and his wife were co-owners of a parcel of realty. After
25 years of marriage, they decided to execute wills. Before executing
the wills, they agreed in writing that each would leave a life estate in
his or her share of the realty to the other, and that the survivor would
leave a fee interest in the realty to their son, the plaintiff. After
executing their wills, they told the plaintiff about their agreement. The
plaintiff had recently contracted for the purchase of a residence but
subsequently canceled the contract. Shortly afterwards, the defendant's
wife died, leaving a life estate in her share of the realty to the
defendant. One year later, the defendant remarried and changed his will
to leave the realty to his second wife. When the defendant died, the
plaintiff learned that the defendant's will left the realty to his second
wife, so he sued the executrix of the defendant's estate for damages
resulting from the defendant's breach of his agreement with his first
wife.

The court should find for

295

(A) the plaintiff, because he canceled his contract for the purchase of a
residence in reliance on the agreement between the defendant and
his first wife.

(B) the plaintiff, because after his mother's death, the plaintiff became a
creditor beneficiary of the agreement between the defendant and his
first wife.

(C) the defendant's executrix, because the plaintiff is a donee

beneficiary of the agreement between the defendant and his first
wife.

(D) the defendant's executrix, because by its terms, the agreement

between the defendant and his first wife might be capable of being
performed within one year.

87. The plaintiff, an unmarried woman, became pregnant. Before the child
was born, she told the defendant that he was the father. The defendant
agreed to pay the expenses of having the child in return for the
plaintiff's promise not to bring a paternity suit. After the child was
born, the defendant refused to pay. A blood test then proved that the
child could not be the defendant's. The plaintiff sued the defendant,
claiming the defendant still needed to live up to the settlement since
she had truly believed he was the father of the child. The court should
rule in favor of

(A) the plaintiff, because she detrimentally relied on the defendant's

promise.

(B) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff had a reasonable subjective

belief that her claim was valid.

(C) the defendant, because forbearance to bring suit cannot count as

consideration for a settlement.

(D) the defendant, because the plaintiff merely surrendered an invalid

claim.

88. When they decided to computerize their paperwork, a law firm

contacted a specialist in the application of computer technology to the
practice of law. After negotiations, the firm entered into a written
contract with the specialist on June 1. According to the terms of the
contract, the specialist was to immediately deliver and install in the
office of the firm a computer and other specified hardware. The
specialist was also required to design and install, by October 15,

296

software consisting of a computer program that would suit the special
needs of the firm's practice. In addition, the specialist agreed to
service and maintain the hardware for a period of six years from the
date of the contract. In return, the firm agreed to pay $5,000 within 30
days after delivery of the hardware, $5,000 within 30 days after
delivery of the software, and $1,000 on the first day of each year that
the contract remained in effect.

The firm also agreed to furnish specifications for the software at least
30 days before the date for its installation. The hardware referred to in
the contract was standard equipment, readily available from and
serviceable by any reputable computer supplier. The software was not
standard, however, and its design required special skill and
knowledge regarding the application of computer technology to the
practice of law. The contract specified that the price of the hardware
was $6,000, the price of the software was $4,000, and the charge for
service and maintenance was $1,000 per year. On June 15, the
specialist installed the agreed hardware in the office of the firm. On
June 20, in satisfaction of an antecedent debt, the specialist assigned to
another computer programmer her rights to receive payment for
hardware already delivered under the contract with the firm. On
August 1, before beginning to work on the design for the agreed
software, the specialist sold her business to an established and
reputable computer dealer. By the terms of the sale, the specialist
assigned to the computer dealer all her rights under the contract with
the firm.

The firm failed to make any payment following the installation of the
hardware, and on August 15, the specialist instituted a claim against
them for $5,000. Which of the following would be the firm's most
effective argument in defense against that claim?

(A) The specialist has not begun work on designing the software

required by the contract.

(B) The specialist has made at least one effective assignment of her

rights under the contract.

(C) The firm has no assurance that the specialist's obligations under the

contract will be fulfilled.

(D) The contract between the specialist and the firm was divisible.

89. A drug manufacturer made vaccines and sold them to various

distributors. Just before the drug manufacturer was about to raise the
price of its vaccines, one of the distributors learned of the pending
price increase. On May 19, the distributor placed a large order for
1,000 vials. The distributor's order stated that the distributor was to
receive a price of $64 per vial (the old price), compared with the new
price of $171. On June 3, the manufacturer shipped 50 vials at the old
price, and simultaneously notified the distributor that the remainder of
this order would be priced at the new price. The notice said the
manufacturer was shipping the 50 vials as a favor, and acceptance of
the order was expressly conditioned on the manufacturer's terms. The
notice also said that if the distributor wanted to cancel the balance of
the order, it could do so on or before June 13. The distributor sued for
an order of specific performance compelling the manufacturer to sell it
the remaining 950 vials at the old price. The court should rule in favor
of

(A) the distributor, because the manufacturer accepted the offer by

shipping 50 vials.

(B) the distributor, because the manufacturer breached the contract by

sending only 50 vials.

(C) the manufacturer, because the distributor's actions were

unreasonable.

(D) the manufacturer, because it made a counteroffer.

90. The defendant was a veterinarian who specialized in the treatment of

livestock, including pigs, horses, cows, and sheep. The plaintiff was a
farmer who raised various species of livestock. In addition, the
plaintiff kept a private collection of exotic animals. Because the
plaintiff's livestock frequently needed the attention of a veterinarian, he
entered into a written contract with the defendant on January 1. Under
the terms of the contract, the plaintiff was to pay the defendant $250
per month for one year, in return for which the defendant would render
whatever treatment the plaintiff's livestock required during that period.

On February 10, the local zoo telephoned the defendant, offering to
give her a surplus tiger. Although the defendant had no experience with
exotic animals, she accepted the tiger and put it in a cage in the back of
her office. On February 22, having heard that the defendant had
acquired a tiger, the plaintiff called her. When he asked the defendant

298

if she was interested in selling the tiger for $450, she said, “I was
hoping to get $1,000 for the tiger, but I'll throw it in under our existing
contract without charging you anything at all for it.” On March 10, the
defendant was at the plaintiff's farm for the purpose of inoculating
some of his cattle. When the plaintiff asked why she had not brought
the tiger, the defendant said, “I've changed my mind. If you want the
tiger, you'll have to pay $450 for it.”

The plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant because of her
refusal to deliver the tiger as promised. The court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because although the defendant was not a merchant as

to the sale of a tiger, she was a merchant as to the sale of veterinary
services.

(B) the plaintiff, because his conversation with the defendant on
February 22 resulted in a valid modification of the existing
contract.

(C) the defendant, because her promise to give the plaintiff the tiger

was unsupported by consideration.

(D) the defendant, because her promise to give the plaintiff the tiger

was not in writing.

91. On January 3, a lumber retailer ordered from a lumber wholesaler

1,000 2” × 4” fir boards, each 8 feet in length, for delivery by January
15. When the wholesaler delivered the fir boards on January 15, they
were received by the retailer's manager, who informed the retailer that
delivery was made but that the boards delivered by the wholesaler
were only 7 feet long. The retailer intended to notify the wholesaler
immediately, but he was busy and forgot to do so.

On February 20, the retailer received the wholesaler's bill for the
boards, but he did not pay the bill or communicate with the wholesaler
in any way. On May 15, the wholesaler instituted a claim against the
retailer for the price of the boards, and, in defense, the retailer
contended that the boards delivered did not conform to the contract of
sale. The court should find for

(A) the wholesaler, because the retailer failed to inform him that the

boards were only 7 feet in length.

(B) the wholesaler, because a merchant buyer who accepts delivery of

299

nonconforming goods is bound to pay for them at the contract price.

(C) the retailer, because the boards did not conform to the contract of

sale.

(D) the retailer, because a merchant seller is not entitled to the price of
nonconforming goods if a reasonable inspection prior to shipment
would have disclosed the nonconformity.

92. A manufacturer of tractors had purchased hundreds of motors from an
engine maker in the past at a price of $5,000 each. In 2011, the engine
maker ceased production of the motor. By April 15, 2012, the engine
maker found that she had only three motors left in her warehouse.
Because she wanted to make room for the newer models, the engine
maker signed and sent the following letter to the tractor manufacturer
on April 15, 2012:

I have only three motors left in stock and have stopped manufacturing
them. If you are interested, I will sell you any or all of them for $1,000
each, a fraction of their usual price. Because we have done business in
the past, I promise to hold this offer open until June 1, 2012.

Because the engine maker told the tractor manufacturer that she would
hold the offer open until June 1, the tractor manufacturer went away on
vacation without responding. On May 15, 2012, not having heard from
the tractor manufacturer, the engine maker sold two of the motors to a
car dealer for $1,000 each. Afraid to lose out on any more motors, the
tractor manufacturer then bought the remaining motor when he
returned.

Was the engine maker's statement, “I promise to hold this offer open
until June 1,” supported by consideration?

(A) Yes, because it was a firm offer under the UCC.

(B) Yes, because the tractor manufacturer detrimentally relied upon it

by not responding before May 15.

(C) Yes, because the tractor manufacturer subsequently purchased one

of the motors from the engine maker.

(D) No, because the tractor manufacturer gave nothing in return for the

promise.

93. The defendant and her assistant were working alone late one night

300

when the defendant had a heart attack that rendered her unconscious
and caused her to fall down an airshaft. The assistant believed the
defendant to be dead, but he called for an ambulance and leaped into
the airshaft, sustaining serious injury himself. Finding that the
defendant was still alive, the assistant gave her first aid consisting of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. When the ambulance arrived,
paramedics used stretchers and pulleys to get the defendant and the
assistant out of the airshaft, and then they brought them to the hospital.
Several days later, while she was still in the hospital, a doctor told the
defendant that she would probably have died if not for the assistant's
quick and effective action. The defendant wrote the assistant a note that
said, “In return for your saving my life, I'm going to pay all your
hospital bills. In addition, I'm going to add a bonus of $3,000 per
month to your salary for the rest of your life. If you choose to retire
right now, I'll pay you $3,000 per month for the rest of your life as a
retirement pension.” The defendant paid the assistant's hospital bills,
but because her business took an unexpected downturn, she never paid
him $3,000, and subsequently she informed him that she would not be
able to pay him a bonus or a retirement pension. If the assistant asserts
a claim against the defendant for her failure to pay him the bonus of
$3,000 per month, which of the following would be the assistant's most
effective argument in support of his claim?

(A) The defendant's promise to pay the bonus was in writing.

(B) The assistant detrimentally relied on the defendant's promise.

(C) The defendant's promise was supported by an underlying moral

obligation.

(D) The assistant's rescue of the defendant resulted in a contract

implied-in-fact.

94. An art dealer employed several agents who traveled throughout the
world purchasing art for her to sell in her gallery. One of her agents
sent her a painting that she said was by a famous artist. The dealer had
just received the painting and was about to place it on display when the
buyer, a collector of art, came into the gallery. Seeing the new painting,
he said, “An interesting painting by the famous artist.” The dealer
replied, “Yes, it is. I'm asking $50,000 for it.” The buyer agreed to the
price and immediately wrote a check for the sum of $50,000 payable to
the order of the dealer, writing the words “Payment in full for the
painting by the famous artist” on the back of the check. The dealer

301

accepted the check and delivered the painting to the buyer. If the
painting had actually been by the famous artist, it would have been
worth $50,000. The same day, however, the buyer discovered that the
painting was a forgery, worth only a few hundred dollars, and he
stopped payment on his check before the dealer could cash it.

If the dealer asserts a claim against the buyer for breach of contract,
which of the following would be the buyer's most effective defense?

(A) The contract of sale was not evidenced by a writing signed by both

parties.

(B) At the time of sale, the buyer and the dealer both believed that the

painting was by the famous artist.

(C) It is unconscionable to make the buyer pay $50,000 for a painting

worth only a few hundred dollars.

(D) The painting was not adequate consideration for the buyer's

promise to pay.

95. On February 1, the landlord and the tenant entered into a written

contract. By its terms, the landlord was to rent the tenant a building for
use by the tenant as a “sports book,” which is an establishment where
bets are made on horse races and other sporting events. The tenant's
tenancy was to commence on April 1 and to continue for a period of
two years. Rent was to be $1,000 per month, plus 20 percent of the
tenant's gross profits. Prior to occupancy by the tenant, the landlord
was to remodel the building's interior so that it would be suitable for
the tenant's purpose. Specifically, the contract required the landlord to
install a “tote-board” that could instantaneously compute and display
gambling odds on specified sporting events, a series of projection-
screen televisions with cable connections for the broadcast of sporting
events as they happened, and other equipment suitable only for use in a
“sports book” establishment. Upon signing the contract on February 1,
the tenant gave the landlord a deposit of $2,000. At that time, neither
party could have reasonably anticipated that existing state law would
be changed. On April 1, the landlord had not made the agreed
improvements in the interior of the building and refused to comply with
the tenant's demand for the return of his deposit.

On February 1, existing state law prohibited the operation of a “sports
book,” but on April 1, existing state law permitted the operation of a

302

“sports book.” If the tenant sues the landlord for the return of his
deposit, the court should find for

(A) the landlord, because public policy prohibits the enforcement of

gambling contracts.

(B) the landlord, because the agreement of February 1 had an illegal

purpose.

(C) the tenant, because he and the landlord were in pari delicto.

(D) the tenant, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

96. In January, a farmer planted a field of beans that would be ready for
harvest in June. Because she expected the harvest to yield more than
5,000 bushels of beans, she entered into a written contract with a buyer
on March 1, wherein the farmer agreed to sell and the buyer agreed to
buy 2,000 bushels of beans at $2 a bushel to be delivered during the
month of June. On March 2, the farmer entered into an identical written
contract with a restaurant.

In the first week of April, heavy rains inundated the farmer's field,
destroying part of her crop. As a result, she doubted that she would be
able to fulfill her contract with both the buyer and the restaurant. On
April 15, she called the restaurant and said that because of the storms,
she would not be able to deliver more than 1,000 bushels. The
restaurant said “I'll take whatever you deliver, but I intend to hold you
to the terms of our contract.”

On June 15, the farmer harvested her field. The American Bean
Exchange price on June 15 was $2 per bushel, and beans were readily
available at that price. The farmer's harvest yielded 2,000 bushels of
beans, and on June 15 she delivered 1,000 bushels to the restaurant. If
the restaurant institutes a claim against her for damages resulting from
breach of contract, which of the following would be the farmer's most
effective argument in defense?

(A) Her inability to deliver 2,000 bushels was the result of an Act of

God.

(B) She notified the restaurant on April 15 that she would be unable to

deliver more than 1,000 bushels.

(C) The restaurant sustained no substantial damage, since the contract

price equaled the market price on the day of delivery.

303

(D) Her obligation to the buyer was greater than her obligation to the

restaurant, since her contract with the buyer was formed before her
contract with the restaurant.

97. The homeowner went into his garage one morning and found that
someone had broken in during the night and stolen a hand-carved
milking stool that had been stored there. The stool did not have much
intrinsic worth, but it was a family heirloom and had great sentimental
value for the homeowner. The angry homeowner ran into a bar that was
located near his home. Entering the bar, he said in a loud voice, “I'll
pay $1,000 to anyone who finds the thief that stole a hand-carved stool
out of my garage last night.” The owner of the bar heard the
homeowner's statement and said, “I'll catch that thief for you.”

Which of the following statements most correctly describes the
position of the homeowner and the owner of the bar following 
the incident in the bar?

(A) The homeowner has made an offer for a unilateral contract that

became irrevocable when the owner of the bar said, “I'll catch that
thief for you.”

(B) The homeowner has made an offer for a unilateral contract that the
owner of the bar can accept only by catching the thief before the
homeowner makes an effective revocation of the offer.

(C) The homeowner and the owner of the bar are parties to a bilateral

contract.

(D) The homeowner has not made any offer that can be accepted by the

owner of the bar.

98. The landowner was the owner of two adjoining parcels of unimproved
realty. Although she was interested in improving and selling the realty,
she did not have the necessary capital. After negotiation, the landowner
entered into a written contract with a building contractor. According to
the terms of the contract, the builder was to provide labor and
materials for the construction of a building on one of the parcels
according to certain specifications. All construction was to be
completed by a certain date, at which time the landowner was to
convey the other parcel of realty to the builder as his sole
compensation for the labor and materials supplied. The contract
contained a clause providing for liquidated damages in the event of a
breach by either party.

304

After the builder completed construction as agreed, the landowner
refused to convey the other parcel of realty to him. As a result, the
builder appropriately asserted alternative claims for relief against the
landowner, demanding liquidated damages as provided in the contract,
actual damages, or an order directing the landowner to perform as
agreed.

Which of the following correctly describes the builder's rights against
the landowner?

(A) If the liquidated damages clause established a penalty, the court can
properly enter judgment for any actual damages that resulted from
the landowner's breach.

(B) If the liquidated damages clause did not establish a penalty, the
court can properly direct the landowner to perform as agreed.

(C) If the liquidated damages clause established a penalty, the court can
enter a judgment for any actual damages; if it did not, the court can
direct the landowner to perform as agreed.

(D) The builder has no enforceable rights.

99. An automobile dealer sold an expensive line of imported automobiles.
The company that manufactured the vehicles in Germany sold them to
the dealer at the wholesale price for resale by the dealer at the retail
price.

On January 12, a buyer ordered a new automobile from the dealer,
executing a written contract of purchase and sale at the specified retail
price. The car was to be equipped with certain optional equipment and
was to be delivered on or before March 15. Immediately after
contracting with the buyer, the dealer ordered the car from the
company in Germany.

On February 28, another buyer ordered from the dealer a car identical
to that which had been ordered by the first buyer at an identical price.
The following day, before ordering a car for the second buyer from the
company, the dealer received the car ordered by the first buyer. When
the first buyer was notified, however, he said that he had changed his
mind and would not go through with the transaction. The dealer
therefore delivered the car to the second buyer and did not order a car

305

for the second buyer from the manufacturer.

If the dealer asserts a claim against the first buyer for damages
resulting from breach of contract, the dealer is entitled to recover

(A) nothing, because the car was sold to the second buyer at the same

price that the first buyer agreed to pay.

(B) the difference between the wholesale price of the car and its retail

price.

(C) the difference, if any, between the price that the first buyer agreed

to pay for the car and its reasonable market value.

(D) the difference, if any, between the price that the dealer paid for the

car and its reasonable market value.

100. For several years following his graduation from college, the plaintiff
made no attempt to find employment. During this period, he was
usually intoxicated, and spent most of his time drinking alcohol at the
bar owner's tavern. On September 1, 2012, the plaintiff's mother stated
orally that if the plaintiff promised to go to law school and to stop
drinking for the rest of his life, she would give him $10,000 on July 1,
2013. The plaintiff promised that he would never drink alcohol again
and that he would enroll in law school as soon as possible.

The plaintiff began attending a law school two weeks later. In
December 2012, however, he withdrew from the school, deciding that
he did not like it.

On July 1, 2013, the plaintiff's mother refused to pay, and the plaintiff
asserted a claim against her for $10,000. Which of the following
would be the plaintiff's mother's most effective argument in response
to that claim?

(A) The plaintiff's completion of law school was an implied condition

precedent to his mother's promise to pay $10,000.

(B) The plaintiff's remaining in law school until July 1, 2013, was an

implied condition precedent to his mother's duty to pay.

(C) The plaintiff's mother's promise was not supported by

consideration.

(D) The plaintiff's mother's promise was not in writing.

306

101. The defendant's father earned his living as a crop-duster, using an

airplane to dust farmers' fields with insecticides for a fee. When he
died, he left the business to the defendant. Although the defendant did
not know how to fly an airplane and did not personally participate in
crop-dusting, she continued to run the business by hiring pilots to fly
the crop-dusting planes. Soon after inheriting the business, the
defendant entered into a business contract with the plaintiff, a farmer.
The terms of the contract required the defendant's company to dust the
plaintiff's crop four times per year for a period of four years, at a total
price of $10,000 that the plaintiff paid upon signing the contract.

The defendant's company performed as agreed for two years. At the
end of that period, the defendant sold the entire business to a local
pilot, assigning to the pilot the balance of her contract with the
plaintiff. All the defendant's employees agreed to work for the pilot.

After being notified of the assignment, the plaintiff sued the defendant,
asserting that the defendant's sale of the business to the pilot was a
breach of the defendant's obligation under the contract because crop-
dusting involves a personal service. Which of the following would be
the defendant's most effective argument in response to that claim?

(A) An assignment of contract rights includes a delegation of contract

duties.

(B) The pilot had more expertise at crop-dusting than the defendant did.

(C) The defendant had never personally participated in dusting the

plaintiff's fields.

(D) The defendant's assignment of the plaintiff's contract to the pilot did
not impose an additional burden on the plaintiff since there was no
change in price.

102. The shareholder was a major shareholder of the corporation, a retail
company. In January, the corporation had cash-flow problems that
placed it in danger of insolvency. On January 15, the corporation
applied to the bank for a loan, but the bank said that it would lend the
money requested only if the shareholder agreed to guarantee payment
by the corporation. Fearful of losing her investment in the corporation,
the shareholder promised the bank on January 16 that if the corporation
did not repay the loan as agreed, the shareholder would do so. On
January 17, the bank made the requested loan to the corporation.

307

On May 1, the corporation defaulted in payment, and the bank
threatened to force the corporation into bankruptcy. On May 11, in an
attempt to save the company, the corporation officials offered to turn
some of the corporate assets over to the bank for sale at their market
value, with the understanding that if the market value exceeded the
amount that the corporation owed the bank, the bank would refund the
excess to the corporation.

The bank rejected the corporation's offer of May 11 and asserted a
claim against the shareholder for repayment of the loan. Which of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one true,
would be most likely to lead a court to find in favor of the
shareholder?

(A) The shareholder's January 16 promise to pay the corporation's debt

was induced by the fear that the corporation could not continue to
exist without the loan.

(B) The shareholder's January 16 promise to pay the corporation's debt

was not in writing.

(C) The shareholder received nothing of value in return for her January

16 promise to pay the corporation's debt.

(D) The assets that the corporation offered to turn over to the bank on

May 11 were sufficient to repay the loan.

103. The landlord was the owner of a storefront building that she leased to
the tenant for a three-year period. The tenant paid the rent for two
years, and then he assigned the balance of his lease to a woman,
advising the landlord in writing that the woman would be paying the
rent from that point on. For the following five months, the woman paid
the rent directly to the landlord. Then the woman moved out and
stopped paying rent. If the landlord asserts a claim against the tenant
for unpaid rent, which of the following arguments would be most
effective in the tenant's defense?

(A) The landlord's accepting rent from the woman resulted in a

novation.

(B) The landlord's accepting rent from the woman resulted in an accord

and satisfaction.

(C) By accepting rent from the woman, the landlord impliedly

consented to the tenant's assignment to the woman.

308

(D) A prohibition against assignment of a leasehold interest is a

restraint against alienation.

104. The defendant owned a trucking company. His wife, the plaintiff, was
a freelance book illustrator. When a book publisher contacted the
defendant to discuss the transportation of his products, the defendant
promised the plaintiff that he would get the publisher to employ her as
a book illustrator for a year. During negotiations with the publisher, the
defendant offered the publisher a lower rate if the publisher would do
so.

The defendant and the publisher subsequently entered into a written
one-year contract for the defendant to transport all the publisher's
products at a specific low rate. At the same time, the publisher orally
agreed that in return for the low rate that the defendant was giving him,
he would employ the plaintiff for a year as his book illustrator, starting
immediately.

When the plaintiff learned of the agreement, she notified all her clients
that she could no longer work for them because illustrating books for
the publisher would take all her time. For the next six months, the
plaintiff did a satisfactory job as the publisher's book illustrator. Then,
she and the defendant were divorced. Following the divorce, the
defendant told the publisher that he was releasing him from his
promise to employ the plaintiff and would give him the same low rate
even if the publisher did not continue to employ the plaintiff for the
rest of the year. The publisher thereupon discharged the plaintiff from
his employ.

The plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for damages that
resulted from his releasing the publisher from the promise to employ
the plaintiff for a year. If the defendant's only defense is that he
received no consideration for promising the plaintiff that the publisher
would employ her for a year, which of the following would be the
plaintiff's most effective argument in response to that defense?

(A) The publisher's promise to employ the plaintiff for one year was
obtained by the defendant as a gift from the defendant to the
plaintiff.

(B) The defendant made an irrevocable assignment to the plaintiff of

rights under his contract with the publisher.

309

(C) No consideration is required to support a promise between husband

and wife.

(D) The publisher's promise to hire the plaintiff for one year was given

in return for the low rate that the defendant gave him.

105. When the seller inherited a valuable painting, he asked the buyer, an
art dealer, if she was interested in buying it. On January 15, after
looking at the painting, the buyer said that she would not have enough
cash to purchase the painting until February 1. At the buyer's request,
the seller signed a document containing a written offer to sell the
painting to the buyer for $50,000 and a written promise to hold the
offer open until February 2.

On January 20, the seller sold the painting to someone else for
$45,000. The following day, after the buyer read about the sale in a
newspaper, she went to the seller's home with $50,000 in cash and
demanded that the seller sell her the painting for that price. The seller
refused, saying that he was withdrawing his offer.

If the buyer asserts a claim for damages resulting from the seller's sale
of the painting to another, the court should find for

(A) the buyer, because she accepted the seller's offer before the seller

withdrew it.

(B) the buyer, because the seller promised in writing to hold the offer

open until February 2.

(C) the seller, because a judgment for damages is not an appropriate

remedy for breach of a contract to sell a unique chattel.

(D) the seller, because when the buyer tendered payment, she knew that

the seller had already sold the painting.

106. The buyer operated a grocery store in which he sold fresh fish and

other food items. The seller was a wholesaler of fresh fish. By a
written contract, the buyer and the seller agreed that the buyer would
purchase from the seller 100 kilograms per week of a fish known as
“rock lurgid” at a specified price that was higher than the market price
of “scmods,” another type of fish. When the seller made the first
delivery under the contract, however, the buyer refused to accept it,
complaining that the fish delivered by the seller was scmods, a species
unrelated to lurgid. The buyer was aware of the fact that scmods is

310

frequently referred to as “rock lurgid.”

The seller subsequently asserted a breach of contract claim against the
buyer. At the trial, the seller attempted to testify that in the fresh fish
industry, scmods is frequently referred to as “rock lurgid.”

If the buyer objects, this testimony should be

(A) excluded, because it modifies the terms of a written contract that
the buyer and the seller intended to be a complete record of their
agreement.

(B) excluded, because the price to which the buyer and the seller

agreed is higher than the market price of scmods.

(C) admitted, because the buyer was aware of the fact that scmods is

frequently referred to as “rock lurgid.”

(D) admitted, to explain the meaning of the term “rock lurgid” as used

in the contract.

107. After serving in the military for 10 years, the plaintiff informed her
father that she had gotten married and was retiring from military
service. Glad to hear the news, the plaintiff's father said, “Because
that's what I always hoped you would do, I'm going to give you a home
as a wedding present.” He showed the plaintiff plans for the
construction of a house and promised that he would have it built on a
lot that he owned and would deed it to her as soon as it was complete.
The plaintiff was so pleased with the plans that her father showed her
that she immediately canceled a contract that she had already made for
the purchase of a home.

The following week, the plaintiff's father contacted the defendant, a
builder. The plaintiff's father showed the defendant the plans and
asked her to build a house according to those plans so that he could
give it to his daughter as a wedding present. By a written contract, the
plaintiff's father and the defendant agreed that the defendant would
build on the father's lot according to the plans on a cost-plus-profit
basis. The plaintiff's father immediately sent a copy of the contract and
plans to the plaintiff.

The defendant subsequently informed the plaintiff's father that soil
conditions would make it necessary to drive piles for the foundation,

311

increasing costs by approximately 600 percent. At the defendant's
suggestion, the plaintiff's father and the defendant agreed to the
construction of a less expensive house instead, to be based on different
plans. When the plaintiff learned about the change, she informed her
father and the defendant that she was dissatisfied with their new
agreement.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant as a third-party
beneficiary of the original contract between the plaintiff's father and
the defendant, the defendant's most effective argument in defense
would be that

(A) the plaintiff was a donee beneficiary because the house was being

built as a wedding present for her.

(B) the plaintiff was a creditor beneficiary because the contract

between her father and the defendant was made after her father
promised the plaintiff that he would give her the house.

(C) the plaintiff did not rely to her detriment on her father's promise to

give her a house built according to any particular plans.

(D) the plaintiff was not an intended third-party beneficiary of the

contract between her father and the defendant.

108. On January 5, because he needed money to pay the rent on his store,

the storeowner sent copies of the following letter to four possible
buyers:

I need to sell my heart-shaped diamond ring by January 15 for $1,500.
I am making this offer to four possible buyers because all of you have
admired the ring. If interested, please contact me before January 15.

On January 14, the storeowner received a letter from the first buyer
agreeing to pay $1,500 for the ring. The storeowner did not respond to
letter. On January 17, the storeowner received a letter from the second
buyer agreeing to pay $1,700 for the ring. On January 17, the
storeowner wrote to the second buyer saying, “I agree to the terms of
your letter.”

The first buyer asserts a claim against the storeowner on account of the
storeowner's refusal to sell the ring to the first buyer for $1,500. The
court should find for

312

(A) the storeowner, because the offer contained in the storeowner's

letter of January 5 was revoked by his letter to the second buyer on
January 17.

(B) the storeowner, because he did not accept the offer contained in the

first buyer's letter.

(C) the first buyer, because the first buyer complied with the terms of

the storeowner's offer.

(D) the first buyer, because the second buyer's letter was not received

by the storeowner until after January 15.

109. The defendant was a retailer of home-gardening supplies. On March 1,
the defendant entered into a written contract with a wholesaler of
seeds. According to the terms, the wholesaler was to furnish the
defendant with seeds in 10-pound bags at a specified price. The
contract provided that for a period of one year, the defendant would
purchase all its seeds from the wholesaler and that the wholesaler
would furnish all the seeds required by the defendant. It provided
further that the defendant would advise the wholesaler of its
requirements by the first of each month, and that the wholesaler would
make delivery by the end of that month. The contract was silent about
the right to assign or delegate.

Upon signing the contract on March 1, the defendant notified the
wholesaler of its seed requirements for that month. The wholesaler
made a delivery to the defendant on March 17. Prior to April 1, the
defendant notified the wholesaler of its requirements for April. On
April 20, the wholesaler sold its entire business to the plaintiff,
including its contract with the defendant, and notified the defendant of
the sale the same day. On April 24, after the defendant received notice
of the assignment, the plaintiff delivered the seed that the defendant
ordered from the wholesaler.

The next day, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, enclosing a check for
the seeds the plaintiff had delivered and demanding that the plaintiff
assure the defendant that it would be able to meet the defendant's seed
requirements in the future. On June 1, not having heard from the
plaintiff, the defendant notified the wholesaler and the plaintiff that it
was canceling the contract.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for breach of

313

contract, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant failed to order seeds as

required by contract.

(B) the plaintiff, because there was no indication that the terms of the

contract would not be performed by the plaintiff.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff failed to furnish assurances as

demanded by the defendant.

(D) the defendant, because requirements contracts are not assignable

without consent of the purchaser.

110. The homeowner hired a painting contractor to paint the homeowner's

residence, entering into a valid written contract with the contractor that
fixed the price of the job at $5,000 and provided that the contractor
would deliver a “satisfactory result.” Because the contractor wished to
give his daughter the money that he received from the job as a wedding
gift, a clause of the contract directed the homeowner to pay the money
directly to the daughter. After the contractor finished painting the
house, he sent the homeowner a bill for $5,000. When the homeowner
received the bill, he called the contractor and complained about the
paint job, saying that he did not think it was “satisfactory” as required
by the contract. He said, “I've got half a mind not to pay you at all, but
if you'll take $4,500, I'm willing to call it square.” The contractor
reluctantly agreed to accept $4,500 payable directly to him because he
needed cash. The homeowner paid the $4,500 to the contractor, who
did not give any part of it to the daughter.

The daughter learned about the contract between the contractor and the
homeowner after the contractor received payment from the
homeowner. Which of the following most accurately describes the
rights of the daughter?

(A) The daughter is entitled to collect $5,000 from the homeowner.

(B) The daughter is entitled to collect $4,500 from the contractor.

(C) The daughter is entitled to collect $5,000 from the homeowner or

$4,500 from the contractor, but not both.

(D) The daughter is not entitled to collect anything from either party.

111. When the landowner's daughter told him that she was getting married,
the landowner was so happy that he promised to deed her a parcel of

314

realty that he owned and to have a house built on it for her as a
wedding present. The following day, the landowner entered into a
written contract with the defendant, a building contractor, for the
construction of a house on the landowner's land. The landowner later
gave his daughter a copy of the contract, and, as a result, she canceled
a contract into which she had previously entered for the purchase of a
home. As a result of an argument between the landowner and the
defendant, the defendant never built the house.

The landowner later deeds the land to his daughter, and she asserts a
claim against the defendant for failure to fulfill the obligations under
his contract with the landowner. The court should find for

(A) the daughter, because the landowner intended for her to benefit

from his contract with the defendant.

(B) the defendant, because the contract called for personal services.

(C) the defendant, because the daughter is an incidental beneficiary.

(D) the defendant, because the daughter is a donee beneficiary.

112. The defendant was an investor who frequently bought and sold real
estate on his own account. He had purchased a parcel of realty for
$100,000 and was considering selling it. On September 1, the plaintiff,
another real estate investor, asked whether the defendant would be
willing to accept $125,000 for the property. The defendant said that he
would, but only if payment was in cash. When the plaintiff said that he
would need a month or two to raise that kind of money, the defendant
wrote the following on a sheet of paper and signed it:

I  hereby  offer  to  sell  my  realty  to  the  plaintiff  for  $125,000  cash.  I
promise  to  hold  this  offer  open  until  November  1,  and  I  further
promise  that  I  will  not  sell  the  property  to  anyone  else  before  then.
This is a firm offer.

On October 20, the defendant sold the property to another person for
$110,000 and wrote the plaintiff a note in which he said, “I hereby
withdraw my offer to sell you the property for $125,000.” On October
25, the plaintiff purchased the property from the other person for
$135,000.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from the defendant's sale of the property to the other person,

315

the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because he received no consideration for his

promise to keep the offer open.

(B) the defendant, because he sold the realty to the other person more

than 30 days after promising the plaintiff to keep the offer open.

(C) the plaintiff, because the document that the defendant signed on

September 1 was a firm offer in writing.

(D) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff customarily engaged in buying

and selling real estate.

113. When he won the state lottery, the defendant bought a new home and
decided to have it landscaped by a well-known landscape architect.
After investigating several sources, the defendant learned that the
landscaper was one of the most famous landscape architects in the
world. Following a series of discussions, the defendant and the
landscaper entered into a written contract that called for the
landscaper to design and execute a landscaping plan for the defendant's
property at a total price of $90,000. Upon completion of the job, the
defendant was to pay $80,000 of this sum directly to the landscaper.
The defendant agreed to pay the balance of $10,000 to the plaintiff
because the landscaper was indebted to the plaintiff for that sum. A
clause of the contract provided that “there shall be no assignment of
rights under this contract.”

The landscaper's design called for a moat to be dug around the
defendant's house and planted with aquatic plants. Although the
landscaper completed the rest of the job himself, he hired an
earthmoving subcontractor to dig the moat, which the earthmoving
subcontractor did in complete conformity with the landscaper's plan.
When the job was completed, the plaintiff executed a document
purporting to assign his rights under the contract to another person.
The entire job was completed in a reasonably workmanlike manner,
but the defendant refused to make any payment under the contract.

The plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for $10,000, which
the plaintiff claims the defendant owes him under the contract. Which
of the following would be the defendant's most effective argument in
defense against that claim?

(A) The plaintiff has made a valid assignment of his rights under the

316

contract.

(B) The plaintiff was not a party to the contract.

(C) The plaintiff was a mere incidental beneficiary of the contract.

(D) There was no mutuality of obligation between the defendant and the

plaintiff.

114. A manufacturer needed a new factory and purchased a parcel of realty
on which he wished to have it constructed. After negotiation, the
manufacturer entered into a valid written contract with a licensed
builder. Pursuant to its terms, the builder was to construct a two-story
building on the manufacturer's realty according to specifications
furnished by the manufacturer, at a total price of $250,000 to be paid in
full upon completion of the building. The builder completed the
building, and the manufacturer paid him $250,000, but subsequently the
manufacturer learned that the building failed to conform to the
specifications. As a result, it would not serve the manufacturer's
purpose. The building had the same value as if constructed in
conformity with the specifications, but it would cost the manufacturer
$12,000 to make it conform to the specifications. Because of an
increase in the costs of construction, it would cost $350,000 to
construct a new building in conformity with the specifications.

If the manufacturer asserts a claim against the builder for breach of
contract, the manufacturer should recover

(A) nothing, because the building had the same value as if built in

conformity with the specifications.

(B) $12,000 (the cost of making the building conform to the

specifications).

(C) $100,000 (the difference between the contract price and the cost of

having a new building constructed in accordance with the
specifications).

(D) $250,000 (the contract price).

115. The seller wanted to sell his piano. Because four buyers had all

expressed interest in it, the seller wrote and signed the following letter
on May 1, sending a photocopy to each of the persons named:

Dear Four Potential Buyers:

317

I know that you are all interested in buying my piano and I need to sell
it. I therefore promise to sell it to whichever of you makes the highest
offer prior to June 15.

(signed)

The seller's letter of May 1 to the four buyers is best described as

(A) a firm offer.

(B) an invitation for offers.

(C) an option to purchase that was given to Able, Baker, Carr, and
Davis but could only be exercised by the first to respond.

(D) an auction.

116. On January 17, a homeowner hired a builder to build a new

greenhouse on his property. After negotiation, they entered into a valid
written contract that fixed the price at $8,000. Work was to be
completed by March 1. On February 1, when the greenhouse was one-
quarter complete, it was totally destroyed in a freak snowstorm. The
damage made it impossible to complete construction by March 1.
Because he was scheduled to begin construction on a new hotel on
March 2, the builder informed the homeowner that he would perform
no further work on the greenhouse. The homeowner subsequently hired
a second builder, who agreed to build the greenhouse for $9,000. The
first builder sued the homeowner on a quasi-contract theory, seeking
compensation for the services that he rendered prior to the storm. The
first builder is entitled to receive

(A) the reasonable value of the work performed by the first builder,
less the difference between the price that the homeowner had
agreed to pay the first builder and the price that the homeowner
agreed to pay the second builder.

(B) the reasonable value of the work performed by the first builder.

(C) one-quarter of the price that the homeowner agreed to pay the first

builder for the completed greenhouse.

(D) nothing, since the homeowner has received no benefit from the first

builder's work.

117. The buyer agreed to purchase 300 commercial-grade metal screws

from the seller by a written contract that provided that the buyer would

318

make payment prior to inspection. The screws were delivered by truck
and were in a closed box. The buyer paid the truck driver before
inspecting the screws. Upon subsequent inspection, however, the buyer
discovered the screws were of domestic rather than commercial grade.
The buyer called the seller, offering to return the screws and
demanding return of his money. The seller refused to take the screws
back or give the buyer a refund. Which of the following is most correct
about the effect of the buyer's payment prior to inspection?

(A) The terms of the contract required an unconditional acceptance
prior to inspection, and payment constituted unconditional
acceptance.

(B) Even if the contract provision calling for payment prior to

inspection was invalid, payment resulted in a waiver of the right to
inspect prior to acceptance.

(C) Payment did not impair the buyer's right to inspect the goods prior

to acceptance.

(D) Payment constituted acceptance, but the buyer was entitled to
revoke acceptance within a reasonable time thereafter.

118. On August 1, a cell phone manufacturer posted a notice in the

employee lounge offering $200 to any employee who could design a
“killer app” by November 1, in time for the Christmas gift-buying
season. A designer employed by the manufacturer saw the notice and
immediately began working on a new phone application in his spare
time. On September 1, the manufacturer removed the old sign and
posted a new notice that said, “The offer of a cash prize for a ‘killer
app’ is hereby withdrawn.” On October 1, the designer submitted his
design for a “killer app,” which was eventually adopted for use by the
manufacturer. The manufacturer refused to pay any money to the
designer. If the designer asserts a claim against the manufacturer in a
jurisdiction that accepts the view expressed in the Restatement of
Contracts, Second, the designer's most effective argument will be that

(A) a bilateral contract was formed when the designer submitted the

design that the manufacturer eventually adopted.

(B) the designer relied on the offer contained in the first notice by
working on the design in his spare time prior to September 1.

(C) the promises contained in the first notice could not be withdrawn

until November 1.

319

(D) the company's attempt to withdraw its offer was unconscionable.

119. A hiker was hiking in the woods when she heard a cry for help. She
then saw a climber hanging from the edge of a cliff, clearly about to
fall. The hiker ran to the cliff's edge and pulled the climber to safety.
The climber was so happy that he said, “In token for saving my life, I
promise to pay you $100 the first of next month.” A few days later, the
climber died falling from another cliff. The jurisdiction has a “Good
Samaritan” statute. If the hiker institutes an action against the executor
of the climber's estate for the $100 that the climber promised to pay
her, the court should find for

(A) the hiker, because the jurisdiction has a “Good Samaritan” statute.

(B) the hiker, because she detrimentally relied on the climber's promise

to pay her.

(C) the climber's executor, because the climber's promise was

unsupported by consideration.

(D) the climber's executor, because it is impossible to calculate the

value of the hiker's services.

120. A parts dealer agreed to deliver a special bumper to a car collector's

home for $150. After the contract was signed, the dealer called the
collector and told him that he would not deliver the special bumper as
agreed. The collector succeeded in buying another one like it in
another town for $130, incurring reasonable travel expenses of $20 in
going to pick it up. In an action by the collector against the dealer, the
court should find for

(A) the collector, in the sum of $20.

(B) the collector, in the sum of $40.

(C) the collector, in the sum of $170.

(D) the dealer.

121. When his daughter was about to turn 21, a builder decided he wanted
to give her some money so she could buy a new car. Consequently, the
builder entered into a written contract with a homeowner to build a
new addition. In return, the homeowner agreed to pay the sum of
$5,000 to the builder's daughter on her birthday upon completion of the
work to his satisfaction. A few weeks before her birthday, the builder's
daughter married a circus clown, and the builder did not approve. The

320

builder asked the homeowner to pay the $5,000 to him directly, which
he did. On her birthday, the builder's daughter learned for the first time
of the written agreement between her father and the homeowner. The
daughter then commences a lawsuit against the homeowner. Will the
lawsuit succeed?

(A) No, because she gave no consideration for the homeowner's

promise to pay her.

(B) No, because the payment by the homeowner to the builder was the

result 
of an effective oral modification of the written contract.

(C) Yes, because the daughter is an intended donee beneficiary of the

contract between the builder and the homeowner.

(D) Yes, because the written contract between the builder and the
homeowner operated as an assignment to the daughter of the
builder's right to payment.

122. By a written agreement, a university agreed to buy 100 air conditioners
from a company at a price of $250 each, FOB the company's factory.
On June 1, the company loaded the air conditioners on a truck owned
by an independent trucking company. The company informed the
university that the air conditioners were on their way. Later that day,
the company assigned its rights under the contract to a parts
manufacturer to which it owed money. The university consented to this
assignment. On June 2, en route to the university, the truck fell off a
bridge and the entire shipment was destroyed. In an action by the
university against the company for damages resulting from the non-
delivery of the air conditioners, which of the following would be the
company's most effective argument in defense?

(A) There has been a valid assignment to the parts manufacturer.

(B) The risk of loss passed to the university when the air conditioners

were loaded onto the truck.

(C) The risk of loss passed to the trucking company when the air
conditioners were loaded onto the trucking company's truck.

(D) Performance of the contract was made impossible by the

destruction of the air conditioners.

123. The seller's grandfather left her a collection of the first 30 Super

Jimmy comics, the only Super Jimmy comics in existence. The seller

321

sold some comics and pop art in her art gallery, so she made up a
catalog showing pictures of the 30 comics, and on August 1, she sent a
copy of the catalog to a comic book dealer with a note:

I  know  how  much  you  love  Super  Jimmy,  so  I  wanted  to  give  you  a
chance  to  buy  some  of  the  comics  before  I  offer  them  to  any  other
dealers or collectors. The price is $200 per comic book, no matter how
many  you  buy.  E-mail  me  your  order  within  two  weeks,  or  I'll  put
them on the market.

On August 2, the dealer sent the seller an e-mail that said, “I accept
your offer to sell Super Jimmy Number 30 for $200. I will come to
your house in two days to pick up the comic and will pay you cash at
that time.” On August 3, after receiving the e-mail, the seller
telephoned the dealer and said that because of favorable publicity that
the collection had received, she would not sell Super Jimmy Number
30 for less than $300. The dealer agreed on the telephone to pay $300
for comic Number 30.

On August 4, the dealer sent an e-mail to the seller that said, “I accept
your offer to sell Super Jimmy comics 1 through 29 for $200 each. I
will pick up the comic books tomorrow and will pay for them at that
time.”

On August 5, the dealer showed up at the seller's home and tendered
payment of $200 each for all 30 comic books, but the seller refused to
sell her any of the comics except for Number 30, for which the seller
insisted the agreed price was $300. The dealer left without buying it.
The dealer sued for an order directing the seller to sell the dealer
comics 1 through 29 for $200 each. Which of the following would be
the seller's most effective argument in defense against that action?

(A) Since the dealer is a comic book dealer, there is an adequate

remedy at law.

(B) The seller's August 1 promise to keep the offer open for two weeks

was unsupported by consideration.

(C) The dealer's e-mail of August 2 was a rejection of the seller's offer

to sell comic books 1 through 29.

(D) The catalog and the seller's cover letter were mere invitations to

negotiate.

322

124. An importer of arts and crafts products from Russia sold his products
mainly to department stores and import shops. To keep his sales force
down, the importer did most of his selling by sending catalogs
describing products and prices to prospective customers and taking
orders by mail on forms provided with the catalogs. The forms
contained the phrase “10 percent discount on COD orders only.” After
receiving one of the catalogs, a coffee shop owner decided to order
some Russian coffeepots for sale in her store. The shop owner had
been doing business with the importer on an “open account” basis. On
July 27, she typed the following across the importer's order form:
“Send immediately 50 Russian coffeepots at 10 percent discount.
Payment within 10 days of receipt and acceptance.” The importer
received the order on July 29. On July 30, the importer shipped 50
coffeepots to the shop owner, who received and accepted them on
August 3. On July 31, the importer wrote to the shop owner, “I am
shipping pursuant to your request and will expect payment within 10
days. Since discounts apply only to COD shipments, you are herewith
billed at full price.” The shop owner received the letter and enclosed
bill on August 4. On August 5, the shop owner sent the importer a
check in payment of the amount billed, less 10 percent. If the importer
asserts a claim against the shop owner for the balance of the amount
billed, the court should find for

(A) the importer, because the shop owner's order was on the importer's

order form.

(B) the importer, because the shop owner was aware that the importer's
catalog and order form specified that the 10 percent discount
applied only to COD shipments.

(C) the shop owner, because she had been doing business with the

importer on an “open account” basis.

(D) the shop owner, because the importer accepted her offer to

purchase at a 10 percent discount.

125. A landowner wanted to open a miniature golf course on a parcel of
real estate that he owned. After negotiation, the landowner hired a
builder to build the golf course and a waterslide. The landowner and
the builder entered into a written contract by which the builder agreed
to begin construction on August 1, to be finished with everything
except the waterslide by November 1, and to complete construction of
the waterslide by December 15. The contract price was $150,000 to

323

be paid as follows: $50,000 on August 1; $50,000 upon completion of
everything but the waterslide; and the balance of $50,000 upon
completion of the waterslide. The builder began work on August 1,
after receiving $50,000 from the landowner. By November 1, the
builder completed construction of everything but the waterslide in
accordance with the specifications. The landowner paid $50,000 to the
builder on November 1, and the builder began construction of the
waterslide, but before it was completed, the builder informed the

126. The buyer went to a car dealer to look at some of the cars on display.
Selecting a car, he began negotiating with the dealer. The dealer
offered to sell him the car that was on display in the showroom, but the
buyer said that he wanted to buy a new one. The dealer explained that
the display model was the only one she had, but she was planning to
order some new ones from the manufacturer anyway and would order
one for the buyer if he agreed to purchase it. The buyer and the dealer
entered into a written contract for the sale of a new car at a price of
$10,000, to be paid on delivery within two weeks. The following day,
the dealer ordered 10 new cars from the manufacturer, and the buyer
purchased materials and began building a garage for the car.

One week after contracting with the buyer, the dealer notified him that
the new car was ready for delivery, and the buyer went immediately to
the dealer's showroom to take delivery of it. The buyer tendered his
own personal check in payment of the purchase price, but the dealer
refused to accept it. Which of the following most accurately describes
the legal rights and obligations of the parties upon such refusal by the
dealer?

324

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

(A) The buyer's tender of a check discharged the dealer's obligation

under the contract, since an agreement that is silent as to the manner
of payment is presumed to call for payment in cash.

(B) The buyer's tender of a check discharged the dealer's obligation
under the contract unless the buyer tendered payment in cash
immediately upon being informed of the dealer's refusal to accept
the buyer's check.

(C) The buyer's tender of a check did not discharge the dealer's

obligation under the contract, but the dealer's obligation will be
discharged if the buyer fails to tender cash within a reasonable
time.

(D) The dealer's refusal to accept a check discharged the buyer's

obligation under the contract, since an agreement that is silent as to
the manner of payment is presumed to call for payment in any
manner current in the ordinary course of business.

127. In preparation for a big convention to be held on June 16, the
convention committee ordered 500 bobblehead dolls from the
company at a total price of $500, paying for them in advance. Because
the bobbleheads were to be given to conventioneers as souvenirs, they
were to be imprinted with the name and slogan of the convention and
were to be delivered to the committee on or before June 15. The
company and the committee entered into a written contract containing
the above terms on May 1. The company tendered 475 bobbleheads to
the committee on June 15. The committee instituted an action against
the company for breach of contract. If only one of the following
additional facts were true, which would furnish the company with its
most effective defense to that action?

(A) The company was unable to obtain necessary materials from its
suppliers in time for production of 500 bobbleheads by June 15.

(B) The committee failed to serve the company with notice of its

intention to sue before instituting the action.

(C) Only 400 conventioneers attended the convention.

(D) On June 1, the company advised the committee that it would only
be able to deliver 475 bobbleheads, and the committee orally
agreed to reduce the order to that number.

325

with a homeowner. According to the contract, the broker was given the
exclusive right to sell the homeowner's home at a price of $100,000
for a period of three months. The homeowner agreed to pay the broker
a 7 percent commission “upon transfer of title.” The broker went to
work looking for a buyer.

On August 1, the homeowner entered into a written contract with a
buyer for the purchase and sale of the homeowner's home at a price of
$98,000, with title to close on December 1. The broker was unaware
of the transaction and did not participate in it. On November 1, the
buyer informed the homeowner that he would not be going through
with the deal.

the broker's claim?

(A) The price that the buyer agreed to pay for the purchase of the

homeowner's home was $98,000.

(B) Transfer of title was not to take place until after the three-month

contract with the buyer.

129. When the plaintiff was accepted to law school, her mother was so

proud of the plaintiff that she said, “If you successfully complete your
first year, I'll buy all your books for the following two years and give
you $250 for each ‘A.’ ” The plaintiff's mother died while the plaintiff
was in her first year of law school, but the plaintiff succeeded in
earning two “A”s in her first year and completed school in two
additional years. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against her mother's
executrix for the cost of the books that she purchased in her second and
third year of law school, which of the following would be the
executrix's most effective argument in defense against the plaintiff's
claim?

(A) The agreement between the plaintiff and her mother was divisible.

(B) The agreement between the plaintiff and her mother was not in

326

writing.

(C) The mother's offer was for payment of a cash bonus.

(D) The mother's promise was unsupported by consideration.

130. A man developed a new phone application that allowed users to

follow the records of their favorite college teams. A company liked the
application and offered the man a job as an in-house designer and 30
percent of the application's revenues if the man would give the
company the exclusive right to market and sell the application. The
man and the company agreed to the arrangement. Soon thereafter, the
man assigned his rights in the contract to the plaintiff in return for some
music equipment. A week after that, the man assigned his rights under
the contract to a software company.

Three months later, the company offered to pay the man $50,000 for all
rights to the application if the man would consent to a mutual
rescission of the contract. The man accepted the offer and received a
payment of $50,000. If the plaintiff subsequently institutes an action
against the company for a sum equivalent to 30 percent of the revenues
derived from the sale of the application, the court should find for

(A) the company, because the rights under which the plaintiff is

claiming were subsequently assigned to the software company.

(B) the company, because the company was unaware of the assignment

to the plaintiff at the time it paid $50,000 to the man.

(C) the company, because the right that the man purported to assign to

the plaintiff was neither identified nor existing at the time of the
purported assignment.

(D) the plaintiff, because he gave value for the right that the man

assigned to him.

131. A woman, who had a son and daughter, agreed to deed to her daughter
her farm so long as the daughter agreed to allow her brother to live on
it for as long as he wished. The daughter agreed, but she did not tell
her brother about their mother's condition that he be allowed to live on
the farm.

The woman's sister lived in the same town. She had always wanted the
woman's son, her only nephew, to live near her, so she wrote him a
letter, telling him that if he moved to the town, she would give him her

327

estate when she died. The son, who knew the farm was deeded to his
sister, told his sister that if she would let him live on the farm until
their aunt died, he would give his sister half of what he received from
the aunt. She agreed, and her brother moved onto the farm. The aunt
passed away soon thereafter.

The aunt's will left her entire estate to the son, but the son refused to
share any portion of it with his sister. If the daughter asserts a claim
against her brother for a share of the inheritance that he received from
their aunt, a court should find for

(A) the daughter, because her brother is estopped from denying the

existence of an enforceable contract between him and his sister.

(B) the daughter, because her brother promised to share the inheritance
with her if she promised to allow him to live on the farm until their
aunt's death.

(C) the son, because his sister's promise to their mother created an

implied condition precedent to her brother's obligation to share the
inheritance with his sister.

(D) the son, because his promise to his sister was not supported by

consideration.

132. The homeowner hired the defendant to maintain his lawn, agreeing to
pay him $50 per month for certain specified services. Two months
later, the homeowner sold his house to the plaintiff. At the closing of
title, the homeowner handed the plaintiff the original memorandum of
his agreement with the defendant and executed an assignment to the
plaintiff of his rights thereunder. The defendant continued rendering
services as agreed for an additional six months, receiving a check for
$50 from the plaintiff each month. Then, the defendant notified the
plaintiff that he would no longer be able to work on the lawn.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for breaching the agreement contained
in the memorandum. The court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the payment by the plaintiff did not result in

a novation.

(B) the defendant, because his only agreement was with the

homeowner.

(C) the defendant, because no consideration flowed from the plaintiff to

328

the homeowner in exchange for the memorandum.

(D) the plaintiff, as assignee of the agreement between the homeowner

and the defendant.

133. When the homeowner purchased her home, she obtained a fire

insurance policy. The policy provided that if the home was destroyed
or seriously damaged by fire, the insurance company would pay
“living expenses necessitated by the loss” until the homeowner's house
was rebuilt or she acquired another house, but in no event for a period
in excess of 90 days. The policy stated that since it was often
impracticable to distinguish between normal living expenses and those
necessitated by fire loss, the insurance company's liability for “living
expenses necessitated by the loss” was fixed at $50 per day.

Subsequently, the homeowner's home was seriously damaged by fire.
The homeowner moved into a hotel and entered into a written contract
with a contractor for repairs to her home. The contract required
payment in advance by the homeowner and completion of repairs by
the contractor within 60 days. One of its clauses provided that if the
contractor failed to complete the job on time, the contractor would pay
the homeowner the sum of $50 per day as liquidated damages. It took
the contractor 70 days to complete the job.

The insurance company paid the homeowner $3,000 (60 days at $50
per day), but refused to pay the additional $500 for the 10-day period
caused by the contractor's late performance. If the homeowner sues the
insurance company for $500, the court should find for

(A) the homeowner, because the insurance company agreed to pay $50

per day until the homeowner's house was reconstructed.

(B) the homeowner, because she can establish that her “living expenses
necessitated by the loss” exceeded whatever amount she was
entitled to receive from the contractor.

(C) the homeowner, because at the time the fire insurance policy was

issued to the homeowner, it reasonably appeared that the
homeowner would expend approximately $50 per day in “living
expenses necessitated by the loss” in the event of fire damage to
her home.

(D) the insurance company, because the homeowner is estopped by the
liquidated damages clause in her contract with the contractor from

329

asserting that her “living expenses necessitated by the loss”
exceeded $50 per day.

134. Proud of a local painter's accomplishments, the town council voted to
erect a statue commemorating the painter's victory over his social and
economic disadvantages. Pursuant to town ordinances and regulations,
bids were accepted from several artists, including the sculptor.
Because the sculptor's work was relatively unknown, she attempted to
make her bid more attractive to the council by including a guarantee
that her work would be satisfactory. On February 1, the town council
entered into a written contract with the sculptor, hiring her to create the
statue and agreeing to pay her $5,000 upon its installation on the steps
of the town hall on or before June 30. A clause in the contract
provided, “It is expressly understood that the personal satisfaction of
the mayor is a condition precedent to the council's obligation to make
payment hereunder. Upon completion of the statue, it shall be made
available for inspection by said mayor. If said mayor is unsatisfied
with the work, he shall notify the sculptor immediately, and the
contract shall be canceled without liability of any party.”

The sculptor sculpted a likeness of the painter in farmer's overalls
with a paintbrush in his teeth, which she completed on June 10. The
painter had been arrested in another state on May 30, however, and
charged with possession of a dangerous drug. His trial was scheduled
for September 10.

At the same time, an art collector came to town, saw the statue, and
offered to buy it from the sculptor for $6,000. Fearful that the painter's
pending trial would induce the mayor to reject her statue, the sculptor
immediately accepted the offer, notifying the town council on June 10
that she would not be submitting a statue for the mayor's approval. In
an action by the town council against the sculptor, the court should find
for

(A) the town council, because the sculptor has committed an

anticipatory breach.

(B) the town council, because the statue that the sculptor created might

have met with the mayor's satisfaction.

(C) the town council, because the price that she received from the art

collector exceeded $5,000.

330

(D) the sculptor, because the town council's promise under the contract

was illusory.

135. By a written contract, the owner of a bar agreed to purchase 200

pounds of large pickled eggs from a farmer at a specified price. A term
of the contract provided that “payment shall be due immediately on
delivery and prior to inspection of the shipment.” When a box
containing the eggs was delivered, the bar owner paid the agreed price
without inspecting its contents. One hour later, the bar owner opened
the box and discovered that it contained small eggs rather than large
eggs. When the bar owner called the farmer to ask that the farmer
exchange the small eggs for large ones, the farmer refused. The bar
owner repackaged the eggs and returned them to the farmer.
Subsequently, the bar owner asserted a claim against the farmer for
breach of contract.

If the bar owner succeeds in an action against the farmer for breach of
contract, a court is most likely to

(A) issue an order directing the farmer to deliver 200 pounds of large

pickled eggs as required by the contract.

(B) award damages consisting of the difference between the value of

large eggs and small eggs.

(C) award damages consisting of the purchase price plus the difference
between the contract price and the market price for large eggs.

(D) require the farmer to return the money that the bar owner paid.

136. The buyer, who was planning to go to law school, told the seller that

he might need some law books. The seller had recently inherited a law
library, so he compiled a list of the books in the collection and mailed
it to the buyer on July 5 with a note that said, “Interested in buying?”
The buyer wrote back to the seller and told him that he would buy the
books if the seller delivered them to his home on September 1.

The seller received the letter on Wednesday, July 9, and immediately
responded by writing, “I accept your offer to buy my library and will
deliver it to you as you require.” He signed the letter and mailed it
properly addressed to the buyer, but due to a fire in the post office, it
was never delivered. When the seller delivered the books on
September 1, the buyer refused to accept them.

331

If the seller instituted an action against the buyer for breach of
contract, which of the following statements is most correct about the
seller's letter of July 9?

(A) It bound both parties to a unilateral contract when it was mailed.

(B) It formed a bilateral contract when mailed because the buyer chose

the mail as the medium of communication.

(C) The letter would have constituted an acceptance if it had been

received, but because it was not received, no contract was formed.

(D) The seller's mailing of the letter did not prevent the buyer from

withdrawing his offer.

137. Because the buyer was arranging to move his family across the country
on April 20, the buyer insisted that the contract for his new home
contain a liquidated damages clause. The clause provided that if the
new home was not ready for occupancy on April 20, the seller would
pay the buyer $75 for each day thereafter that it remained unavailable
for occupancy. When the buyer and his family moved on April 20, the
home was not ready for occupancy. As a result, the buyer and his
family had to stay at a motel. On May 1, the seller advised the buyer
that he did not intend to go through with the sale of this house. On May
10, the buyer instituted an action against the seller for specific
performance and damages pursuant to the liquidated damages clause.

With respect to the buyer's demand for damages pursuant to the
contract's liquidated damages clause, the court's finding will turn on
whether

(A) the motel at which the buyer stayed charged a rate that was

commercially reasonable.

(B) the buyer could have avoided staying at a motel by making a

reasonable attempt to mitigate damages.

(C) at the time the contract was formed, the sum of $75 per day was

reasonably related to what the parties believed the buyer's living
expenses would be.

(D) the buyer's purpose in insisting on a liquidated damages clause was

to encourage the seller to vacate the premises on time.

138. A man, who had been studying the writings of various saints, decided
to sell all his worldly possessions, give the money to charity, and hike

332

for a while to seek insight and spiritual fulfillment. After about a
month, the man became ill and collapsed into unconsciousness. When
he awoke, he was in the home of a retired surgeon who now lived like
a hermit in the mountains, and who had found him in a helpless
condition. As the doctor fed garlic soup to the man, the man said, “I
have no money. I can never pay you for any of this.” The doctor
replied, “I'm not doing this for money.”

In the next week, the doctor fed the man and gave him medical
treatment. When the man was well enough to travel, the doctor
borrowed an old pickup truck from a distant neighbor and drove the
man to the house of the man's mother. The following week, after the
man told his mother what the doctor did for him, the man's mother
wrote the doctor: “In gratitude for the services that you rendered my
son, I hereby promise to pay you $350.00 when I get my dividend
check next month.” Before the dividend check arrived, however, both
the man's mother and the doctor died. The doctor's administrator
advised the mother's husband of the letter that his wife had sent and
indicated that he intended to make a claim against her estate for $350.

After a discussion with the administrator, in which the administrator
agreed not to assert a claim against the mother's estate, the husband
prepared a document that read, “In consideration of services rendered
by the doctor to my wife's son, and of the administrator's promise to
make no claim against the estate of my wife, I hereby agree to pay
$350.00 to the doctor's estate.” After signing the document, the
husband handed it to the administrator. The husband never paid
anything to the estate, however, and the administrator instituted suit
against him. The husband defended on the ground that his promise to
pay $350 was not supported by consideration.

Were the services rendered by the doctor sufficient consideration for
the husband's promise?

(A) They are sufficient consideration because they imposed a

preexisting moral obligation on the husband.

(B) They are not sufficient consideration because they were not

requested by the husband.

(C) The question of whether or not they are sufficient consideration

depends on whether the husband received any material benefit from

333

them.

(D) The question of whether or not they are sufficient consideration
depends upon whether the reasonable value of the services
approximated $350.

139. On September 10, the company, a well-known publisher of law books,
posted a notice in the law school bookstore that it would award
$10,000 to the student with the highest grade point average.

A student, who had just begun her final year at the law school, saw the
notice. Her grades already placed her toward the top of her class, but
she resolved to work harder than ever before in an attempt to win the
company's award. On September 20, she mailed a letter to the
company saying, “I accept your offer for the award and will do my
best to win it.” The following May, because of budget cutbacks, the
company posted a new notice at the law school stating that it would
not be presenting any awards.

In a jurisdiction that applies the Restatement of Contracts, 2d rule, a
court's decision as to whether the company's offer was effectively
revoked by the notice posted in May will most likely depend on
whether

(A) the student saw the second notice before taking her exams.

(B) the second notice was as large and as conspicuously posted as the

first.

(C) the student's letter of September 20 was effective when mailed or

when received.

(D) the student made extra efforts in her studies in reliance on the

September 10 notice.

140. When a landowner's daughter and a painting contractor's son

announced that they were getting married, the landowner and the
contractor decided to give them a house as a wedding present. On
January 1, the two men entered into a written agreement with each
other, pursuant to which they were to have a house built on the
landowner's lot, with the landowner and the contractor each paying
half the cost. It was further agreed that after completion of the house,
the contractor would pay the landowner $10,000 as his share of the
cost of the lot, and the landowner would convey the lot to their

334

children.

On February 2, the two men entered into a written contract with a
builder. The contract called for payment in installments, each payment
being due upon completion of a specified stage of building. In addition
to its other terms, the contract contained a clause providing that as
each payment came due, the builder would bill and collect half the
payment from the landowner and half from the contractor. In the
contract, the builder agreed that neither would be responsible to him
for more than half the price.

On March 3, the contractor entered into a separate contract with the
builder. Pursuant to this contract, the builder hired the contractor as a
subcontractor to do all the painting required in connection with the
construction of the house. Because the house was being built for his
son, the contractor agreed to do the job for $3,000, although his work
was worth $5,000. The $3,000 was to be deducted from the final
payment that the contractor would owe the builder for construction of
the house.

In April, the contractor became ill. Because he could no longer work,
he sold his painting business to his son, a competent and licensed
painting contractor, for about half of what it was actually worth. As
one of the terms of the contract of sale, the contractor's son promised
to do all the painting work on the house that the builder was
constructing. The contractor notified the builder of his agreement with
his son. When the house was ready to be painted, however, the
contractor's son informed the builder that he would not paint it.

The landowner then decided he did not want to convey the property to
his daughter and the contractor's son. The contractor's son then sued
the landowner. Which of the following arguments would furnish the
landowner with his strongest defense?

(A) The contractor's son did not rely or assent to the contract of January

1 between the landowner and the contractor.

(B) The contractor's son's painting of the house was a condition

precedent to the landowner's obligation to convey.

(C) The contractor's son was only an incidental beneficiary of the

January 1 contract between the landowner and the contractor since

335

the landowner's primary intention was to benefit his daughter.

(D) The contract that the contractor made with the builder on March 3
was a breach of a fiduciary obligation that the contractor owed the
landowner.

141. The seller and the buyer had been friends for years. The seller was the
owner of a rare guitar, which the buyer had offered to buy from her on
several occasions but which the seller had never been willing to sell.
On the buyer's birthday, the seller and the buyer went out for dinner
and drinks. After dinner, the seller continued drinking until she was
somewhat intoxicated. During their conversation, the seller said, “As a
birthday present, I've decided that I'm going to sell you my guitar for
$500. And just to make sure that I don't change my mind after I sober
up, I'll put it in writing.” With that, she wrote on a paper napkin, “We
agree to the sale of my guitar to the buyer for $500, COD,” and signed
her name at the bottom. The buyer also signed the napkin and put it in
her purse. The following day, the buyer tendered $500 in cash to the
seller, but the seller refused to sell her the guitar, claiming that she had
been drunk when she made the offer. If the buyer is successful in an
action against the seller, a court is most likely to

(A) issue an order directing the seller to sell the buyer the guitar for

$500.

(B) award damages equivalent to the reasonable market value of the

guitar.

(C) issue an order directing the seller to sell her guitar for $500 and
award damages equivalent to the reasonable market value of the
seller's guitar less $500.

(D) award damages of $500.

142. The plaintiff had long admired the defendant's dog, which was trained
to get the paper and start the coffeepot every morning. The plaintiff
finally convinced the defendant to agree to sell him the dog, and the
defendant wrote out a contract that said, “I agree to sell my dog to the
plaintiff. Price to be decided at delivery.” The plaintiff was seeking to
purchase the dog for resale. When the plaintiff arrived to pick up the
dog a week later, the defendant refused to give the dog to him. The
plaintiff then filed suit. Does the UCC apply to the transaction between
the plaintiff and the defendant?

(A) Yes, because this was a transaction in goods.

336

(B) Yes, because the price and the delivery date terms were missing

from the agreement.

(C) No, because, unless it is a farm animal, a living thing does not fit

the definition of “goods” under the UCC.

(D) No, because the plaintiff was seeking to purchase the dog for

resale.

143. An attorney decided to invest $4,000 in art for her office. On

November 1, she decided to purchase a painting from the defendant,
with delivery to be made to the attorney on December 28 after the
painting was framed.

On November 15, the attorney learned that the defendant had
accidentally sold the painting to another buyer. Based on this
knowledge, the attorney gave another art dealer $4,000 to purchase
another painting.

On November 30, the defendant learned of the mistake and got the
painting back from the other buyer. On December 28, when the
defendant arrived at the attorney's office with the framed painting, the
attorney refused to accept it.

The attorney instituted an action against the defendant on December 29
seeking specific performance of the November 1 agreement. With
respect to the attorney's demand for specific performance, a court is
most likely to find for

(A) the defendant, since the attorney refused to accept delivery of the

painting on December 28.

(B) the defendant, since the attorney has already succeeded in investing

$4,000 in art for her office.

(C) the attorney, since the painting is unique.

(D) the attorney, since the defendant's sale to the other person was an

anticipatory repudiation of its contract with the attorney.

144. The seller was the owner of a lot and building that contained two

residential apartments. The seller resided in the upstairs apartment and
rented the downstairs apartment to a tenant and his family on a month-
to-month basis. The buyer was interested in purchasing the realty from

337

the seller. After negotiations, the buyer and the seller entered into a
written contract that provided that the seller would sell the house to the
buyer for $60,000 and that delivery of title was to occur on or before
August 1. The seller promised that at the time title was delivered, the
upstairs apartment would be vacant and that the downstairs apartment
would be vacant within three months thereafter. The buyer promised to
pay $58,000 upon delivery of title and the balance of $2,000 three
months after delivery of title. The contract provided that “The buyer's
obligation to pay $2,000 three months after delivery of title shall be
voided if the downstairs apartment has not been vacated by that time.”

The seller delivered title to the buyer on August 1, and as of
November 15, the downstairs apartment remained occupied by the
tenant. Which of the following statements best describes the buyer's
rights?

(A) The buyer is entitled to an order directing the seller to commence a
legal proceeding against the tenant for the purpose of evicting him
from the premises.

(B) The buyer is not required to pay the seller the additional $2,000.

(C) The buyer is entitled to rescind his contract with the seller,

reconveying title to her and receiving the return of his $58,000.

(D) The buyer may bring a legal proceeding for the purpose of evicting
the tenant from the premises, and, if successful, is required to pay
the seller $2,000 less the expenses he incurred in evicting the
tenant.

145. The buyer was a collector of antiques who had purchased many

expensive pieces from the seller, an antiques dealer. Knowing that the
seller was traveling to Europe, the buyer wrote to him on March 11,
“If you should come across a good piece in your travels, please
purchase it for me. I don't care about the cost.”

On April 17, the seller wrote to the buyer, “I have found an excellent
table. The price is $15,000, but I think it's a good buy. Are you still
interested? If so, let me know if the price is acceptable to you.” The
next day, for personal reasons, the seller decided he did not want to
sell to the buyer.

The buyer received the seller's letter on April 21, and, on that same

338

day, e-mailed the seller, “Fifteen thousand is OK. Buy the piece on my
account.”

The seller later sold the piece to another buyer who offered more
money.

In litigation between the buyer and seller, if a court determines that the
seller's letter of April 17 was an offer, was a contract formed between
the buyer and the seller?

(A) Yes, because sending an e-mail was a reasonable way for the buyer

to accept the seller's offer.

(B) Yes, because, as a merchant, the seller was obligated to act in good

faith.

(C) No, because an offer sent by mail may be accepted only by mail.

(D) No, because the seller changed his mind about the piece prior to

April 21.

146. A banking firm hired a computer-banking specialist to update its
computer network for $15,000. The specialist then went to work
installing hardware and writing special software for the firm. Soon
thereafter, to pay off a debt that the specialist owed to a computer
programmer, the specialist assigned to the computer programmer her
rights to receive payment under the contract. After the work was
completed, the firm refused to pay.

The computer programmer instituted a claim against the firm for
$15,000. Which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if
it were the only one true, would be most likely to lead to a judgment
for the firm?

(A) The programmer was not a specialist in the application of computer

technology to the practice of banking.

(B) The contract between the specialist and the firm did not contain a

clause permitting assignment.

(C) The contract between the specialist and the firm contained language
that stated, “This contract may not be modified except by a writing
signed by both parties hereto.”

(D) The firm paid $15,000 to the specialist prior to being notified of

339

the specialist's assignment to the programmer.

147. The defendant was a veterinarian who sometimes acquired exotic

animals from local zoos. The plaintiff was the owner of a large
livestock ranch.

On March 10, the defendant and the plaintiff agreed that the defendant
would sell the plaintiff an aardvark for $450, payment and delivery to
be on March 20. On March 15, the plaintiff called the defendant and
said, “When you deliver the aardvark, will you throw in a pig for my
daughter without charging extra for it?” The defendant said, “Yes,” but
when she delivered the aardvark on March 20, she refused to give the
daughter a pig. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant
because of her failure to deliver the pig as promised, the court should
find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff and the defendant were merchants

with respect to the sale of a pig.

(B) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff and the defendant were merchants

with respect to the sale of an aardvark.

(C) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff and the defendant were merchants

with respect to the sale of an aardvark and a pig.

(D) the plaintiff.

148. On January 3, a retailer of lumber ordered from a lumber wholesaler

1,000 2” × 4” fir boards, each 8 feet in length, for delivery by January
15. When the wholesaler delivered the fir boards on January 15, they
were received by the retailer's manager, who informed the retailer that
delivery was made but that the boards delivered by the wholesaler
were only 7 feet long. The retailer intended to notify the wholesaler
immediately but was busy and forgot to do so.

On January 16, economic conditions caused the price of lumber to
double, and on January 17, the retailer notified the wholesaler that the
boards were only 7 feet long, returned them to the wholesaler, and
demanded that the wholesaler furnish 8-foot boards at the contract
price. If the wholesaler refuses to do so, and the retailer asserts a
claim against the wholesaler for breach of contract, the court should
find for

(A) the retailer, in a sum equivalent to the difference between the

340

contract price and the fair market value of 7-foot boards on January
15.

(B) the retailer, in a sum equivalent to the difference between the

contract price and the fair market value of 8-foot boards on January
15.

(C) the retailer, in a sum equivalent to the difference between the

contract price and the fair market value of 8-foot boards on January
17.

(D) the wholesaler.

149. A pawnbroker occasionally sold used jewelry to the buyer, who

owned a jewelry store. On June 1, the pawnbroker sold the buyer a
ring for $2,500, representing the stone in it to be a diamond. On July
16, the buyer learned that the stone in the ring that he had purchased
from the pawnbroker was not a diamond but rather cubic zirconia,
making the ring worth only $300.

On July 17, the pawnbroker assigned to a retailer, for $1,500 cash, the
sales contract with the buyer. The retailer then requested payment from
the buyer. The buyer refused.

The retailer sued the buyer, but in defense, the buyer claimed the stone
was not a diamond, and the suit was unsuccessful. If the retailer brings
an action against the pawnbroker, the court should find for

(A) the pawnbroker, because an assignment does not imply a warranty

that the obligor will perform.

(B) the pawnbroker, because the assignment to the retailer caused the
retailer to step into the pawnbroker's shoes with respect to the
claim against the buyer.

(C) the retailer, because the buyer's defense existed at the time the
assignment was made by the pawnbroker to the retailer.

(D) the retailer, because an assignment for consideration implies a

warranty that the obligor will perform.

150. In anticipation of changing over to a more “upscale” restaurant, a

restaurant entered into a written agreement with a new butcher. Under
the agreement, the butcher would provide “as many top quality steaks
at $10 per pound as the restaurant decides to order.” A week later,

341

before the restaurant had made its first order, the butcher called the
restaurant and said that a sharp rise in the price of cattle feed meant
that it was impossible to provide “top quality” steaks for less than $15
per pound. The butcher said he was willing to provide lower quality
steaks if the restaurant wanted to keep the price the same. The
restaurant responded that it was already planning to host the National
Meat Eater's Convention and could only do so if it had top quality
steaks. The restaurant sued the butcher for breach.

How should the court rule?

(A) In favor of the restaurant, because of its detrimental reliance.

(B) In favor of the restaurant, because this is a valid requirements

contract.

(C) In favor of the butcher, under the doctrine of impossibility.

(D) In favor of the butcher, because the restaurant's promise is illusory.

151. On February 1, the landlord and the tenant entered into a written

contract. By its terms, the landlord was to rent the tenant a building for
use by the tenant as a “sports book,” which is an establishment where
bets are made on horse races and other sporting events. The tenant's
tenancy was to commence on April 1 and to continue for a period of
two years. Upon signing the contract on February 1, the tenant gave the
landlord a deposit of $2,000. At that time, neither party could have
reasonably anticipated that existing state law would be changed.

On February 1, existing state law permitted the operation of a sports
book, but on April 1, existing state law prohibited the operation of a
sports book. If the tenant sues the landlord for the return of his deposit,
the court should find for

(A) the landlord, because public policy prohibits the enforcement of

gambling contracts.

(B) the landlord, because the purpose of the agreement of February 1

has become illegal.

(C) the tenant, because he and the landlord were not in pari delicto.

(D) the tenant, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

152. In January, a farmer planted an orchard of apples that would be ready

for harvest in June. The farmer entered into a written contract with a

342

restaurant on March 2, wherein the farmer agreed to sell and the
restaurant agreed to buy 2,000 bushels of apples to be delivered during
the month of June.

In the first week of April, heavy rains inundated the farmer's orchard,
destroying part of her crop. As a result, she doubted that she would be
able to fulfill her contract with the restaurant. On April 15, she called
the restaurant and said that because of the storms, she would not be
able to deliver more than 1,000 bushels. The restaurant said, “I'll take
whatever you deliver, but I intend to hold you to the terms of our
contract.” However, immediately after the call, the restaurant
contracted to purchase from another supplier 1,000 bushels of apples
with delivery on June 15.

On June 15, the farmer delivered 2,000 bushels to the restaurant, but
the restaurant refused to accept any more than 1,000 bushels. If the
farmer sues the restaurant for breach of contract, the restaurant's most
effective defense would be based on the principle of

(A) novation.

(B) anticipatory repudiation.

(C) nudum pactum.

(D) impossibility of performance.

153. A developer entered into a written agreement with a farmer to buy the
farmer's farm for $500,000. The closing was scheduled for September
5. On September 1, the farmer called the developer and said, “I can't
go through with this. The farm means too much to me. Can we just
forget about the contract?” The developer, who was suddenly
interested in buying a different property, said it was fine if the farmer
wanted out. On September 2, the other property was sold to a
homebuilder. On September 3, the developer called the farmer back
and said, “Look, I want to go through with our original closing.” The
farmer said, “You agreed to cancel our contract, and I'm already
talking about selling to someone else for twice the price.”

If the developer sues the farmer for breach of contract, may she
recover?

(A) Yes, because any contract modification had to be in writing.

343

(B) Yes, because the farmer did not act in good faith.

(C) No, because the developer told the farmer it was fine if the farmer

wanted out.

(D) No, because the farmer acted in reliance on the developer's

statements.

154. A sporting goods store called a distributor and ordered 200 football

jerseys at $50 a piece. Three days later, the distributor sent the store a
signed letter marked “Confirmation.” The letter repeated the sales
terms from the phone conversation and said, “This confirms your order
of 200 football jerseys, total price $10,000.” The store received and
read the letter on January 3. The jerseys arrived on January 4. On
January 14, the store called and told the distributor, “We never agreed
to buy these jerseys. We're sending them back.”

Is the agreement enforceable?

(A) Yes, because the agreement is between merchants.

(B) Yes, because the distributor provided consideration by sending the

jerseys.

(C) No, because the agreement violates the Statute of Frauds.

(D) No, because the store told the distributor it didn't order the jerseys

within 14 days of receipt of the letter.

155. A woman's father earned his living as a fumigator, using a fleet of

trucks to fumigate office buildings with insecticides for a fee. When he
died, he left the business to his daughter. Although his daughter did not
know how to drive a truck and did not personally participate in
fumigating, she continued to run the business by hiring workers to
drive the trucks and fumigate the buildings. Soon after inheriting the
business, the woman entered into a business contract with a bank. The
terms of the contract required the woman's company to fumigate the
bank's building four times per year for a period of four years, at a total
price of $10,000 that the bank paid upon signing the contract.

The fumigation company performed as agreed for two years. At the
end of that period, the woman sold the entire business to a local
trucker, assigning to the trucker the balance of her contract with the
bank. All the daughter's employees agreed to work for the trucker.

344

The bank consented to the assignment, but the trucker subsequently
failed to perform as required by the contract. If the bank seeks the
return of the unearned portion of the money that it paid to the woman
on the signing of their contract, it may collect it from

(A) the woman only.

(B) the trucker only.

(C) either the woman or the trucker.

(D) neither the woman nor the trucker, because the bank's only remedy
is a judgment for the difference between the contract price and the
price that the bank would have to pay another for the same service.

156. During negotiations with a printing company, a publisher agreed to hire
the printing company president's wife as a cover artist for a year in
exchange for a lower rate on printing costs. The artist was thrilled and
immediately told all her clients that she wouldn't be able to work for
them. Six months later, after the president and the artist were divorced,
the president called the publisher and said that it could fire the artist if
it chose to do so, with no ramifications to the contract. The publisher
immediately fired the artist.

If the artist asserts a claim against the publisher for damages resulting
from breach of his promise to hire the artist for one year, the court
should find for

(A) the artist.

(B) the publisher, because the artist gave nothing in return for his

promise.

(C) the publisher, because his promise was not in writing.

(D) the publisher, because he and the president mutually rescinded their

contract.

157. After serving in the military for several years, a soldier informed her
father that she had gotten married and was retiring from military
service. Glad to hear the news, the soldier's father agreed to give the
soldier a house built on his land as a present. Thrilled with the gift, the
soldier cancelled her contract to buy another house.

The father and a builder signed an agreement to build a new house,
and the father showed the plans to the soldier. However, after

345

beginning the work, the builder discovered that the house could not be
built for what the father was willing to pay. Consequently, the father
and the builder agreed to a smaller plan for the house.

If the soldier asserts a claim against her father for changing the
building plans, which of the following would be the most effective
argument in support of her claim?

(A) The modification of the father's contract with the builder was

unsupported by consideration.

(B) The soldier detrimentally relied on her father's oral promise by
canceling the contract that she had already made to purchase a
home.

(C) The contract between the father and the builder was a writing

signed by the father.

(D) The soldier's marriage and retirement from military service was

consideration for her father's promise to give her a house built
according to the plans that he showed her.

158. On January 17, a storeowner agreed to sell a penguin-shaped ring to
the plaintiff for $2,000. However, when the plaintiff came to pick up
the ring on January 18, the storeowner refused to sell it to him. If the
plaintiff sues the storeowner, is the plaintiff entitled to specific
performance of the sale?

(A) No, because specific performance is not available as a remedy for

breach of a contract for the sale of personalty.

(B) Yes, because the storeowner is a merchant with respect to the sale

of a diamond ring.

(C) Yes, because the ring is highly unusual.

(D) Yes, because the storeowner could have obtained specific
performance in the event of a breach by the plaintiff.

159. The plaintiff was a retailer of home-gardening supplies. On March 1,
the plaintiff entered into a written contract with a wholesaler of seeds.
According to the terms, the wholesaler was to furnish the plaintiff with
pumpkin seeds in 10-pound bags at a specified price. The contract
provided that for a period of one year, the plaintiff would purchase all
its pumpkin seeds from the wholesaler and that the wholesaler would
furnish all the pumpkin seeds required by the plaintiff. It provided

346

further that the plaintiff would advise the wholesaler of its
requirements by the first of each month and that the wholesaler would
make delivery by the end of that month. The contract was silent about
the right to assign or delegate.

Upon signing the contract on March 1, the plaintiff notified the
wholesaler of its pumpkin seed requirements for that month. The
wholesaler made a delivery to the plaintiff on March 17. Prior to
April 1, the plaintiff notified the wholesaler of its pumpkin
requirements for April. On April 20, the wholesaler sold its entire
business to a new owner, including its contract with the plaintiff, and
notified the plaintiff of the sale the same day. On April 24, after the
plaintiff received notice of the assignment, the new owner delivered
the seeds that the plaintiff ordered from the wholesaler.

The next day, the plaintiff wrote to the new owner, enclosing a check
for the seeds that the new owner had delivered, and demanding that the
new owner assure the plaintiff that it would be able to meet the
plaintiff's pumpkin seed requirements in the future. On June 1, not
having heard from the new owner, the plaintiff notified the wholesaler
and the new owner that it was canceling the contract.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the wholesaler for breach of
contract, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff.

(B) the wholesaler, because the plaintiff impliedly consented to the

assignment by accepting delivery from the new owner.

(C) the wholesaler, because the plaintiff impliedly consented to the
assignment by demanding assurances from the new owner.

(D) the wholesaler, because its assignment of rights to the new owner

implied a delegation of duties.

160. The homeowner hired a painting contractor to paint the homeowner's

residence, entering into a valid written contract with the contractor that
fixed the price of the job at $5,000 and provided that the contractor
would deliver a “satisfactory result.” After the contractor finished
painting the house, he sent the homeowner a bill for $5,000. When the
homeowner received the bill, he called the contractor and complained
about the paint job, saying that he did not think it was “satisfactory” as

347

required by the contract. The paint job had many noticeable drips and
missed spots. He said, “I've got half a mind not to pay you at all, but if
you'll take $4,500, I'm willing to call it square.” The contractor
reluctantly agreed to accept $4,500, even though he thought the job was
just fine and the homeowner was not entitled to a reduction in price.

The contractor subsequently brought a claim against the homeowner
for $500 as the balance due on the agreed price for the paint job,
asserting that his agreement to accept $4,500 was unsupported by
consideration. If the homeowner defends by claiming that there was an
accord and satisfaction, the court should find for

(A) the homeowner, because the homeowner reasonably believed that 
the result was not “satisfactory” as required by the contract.

(B) the homeowner, because no consideration is required for an

agreement to modify a contract.

(C) the contractor, because the agreement to modify the contract was

not in writing.

(D) the contractor, because the contractor did not believe that the result
was not “satisfactory,” as required by the contract, or that the
homeowner was entitled to a reduction in price.

161. A home design store contracted with a manufacturer to buy 1,000

drinking cups made of glass. In response, the manufacturer sent 1,000
drinking glasses made of plastic. The store received the goods, paid
for them, but failed to discover the cups were plastic instead of glass.
A few days later, the store discovered the discrepancy. In the home
wares and design industry, a plastic cup is generally worth half as
much as a glass cup. At the time the cups were delivered, the cost of a
plastic cup was 50 cents, and the cost of a glass cup was $1. However,
due to a huge drop in the stock market, the market price for all
housewares dropped 50 percent. By the time the store could sell the
cups to a discount store, the price for plastic cups was 25 cents.

The home design store sued the manufacturer for damages. The court
should find for

(A) The home design store, for $500.

(B) The home design store, for $750.

(C) The home design store, for $1,000.

348

(D) The manufacturer.

162. A manufacturer needed a new factory and purchased a parcel of realty
on which he wished to have it constructed. After negotiation, the
manufacturer entered into a valid written contract with a licensed
builder. Pursuant to its terms, the builder was to construct a two-story
building on the manufacturer's realty according to specifications
furnished by the manufacturer, at a total price of $250,000, to be paid
in full upon completion of the building.

When the structure was partially completed, the manufacturer decided
to retire from the business and told the builder to stop work. The
builder had already spent $180,000 on materials and labor and would
have needed to spend another $35,000 to complete the building in
conformity with the specifications. Because of an increase in
construction costs, the value of the partially completed structure was
$300,000. If the builder asserts a claim against the manufacturer for
breach of contract, the builder should recover

(A) $265,000 (the value of the partially completed structure less the

cost of completing construction).

(B) $250,000 (the contract price).

(C) $215,000 (the contract price less the cost of completing

construction).

(D) $180,000 (the amount that the builder has expended).

163. The seller wanted to sell his accordion. Because four buyers had all

expressed interest in it, the seller wrote to all of them on May 1, telling
them he was selling his accordion, had told all four of them he was
doing so, and would sell it for a fair price.

On June 16, the seller received a letter from the first buyer offering to
buy the accordion for $1,000. On June 19, the seller received a letter
from the second buyer that said, “I received your offer of May 1. Will
$2,000 buy the accordion?”

On June 21, the seller wrote to the second buyer, “I accept your offer
and will sell you the accordion for $2,000. (signed).”

The seller's letter of June 21 is best described as

349

(A) an offer.

(B) an acceptance.

(C) an invitation to negotiate.

(D) an anticipatory repudiation of the seller's agreement with the first

buyer.

164. The buyer agreed to purchase steel beams from the seller by a written

contract. The beams were delivered by truck and were in a closed box.
Upon inspection, however, the buyer discovered the beams were iron
instead of steel. The buyer sent the seller a letter notifying him that the
beams did not conform to the contract. Even so, the buyer kept and
used the beams, even though iron beams were not as valuable as steel
ones. If the buyer asserts a claim against the seller for breach of
warranty, the court should enter judgment in favor of

(A) the buyer, for the difference between the value of steel beams and

iron beams.

(B) the buyer, for the return of the price that he paid.

(C) the seller, because the buyer used the beams.

(D) the seller, because he might have been able to sell the beams

elsewhere for a higher price.

165. On August 1, the homeowner entered into a written contract with a

buyer for the purchase and sale of the homeowner's home at a price of
$398,000, with title to close on December 1. On November 1, the
buyer informed the homeowner that he was severely ill, and that due to
the changes in his financial circumstances, he would not be going
through with the deal.

The homeowner instituted an action against the buyer for breach of
contract. Which of the following statements is most correct regarding
the legal relationship between the homeowner and the buyer?

(A) The homeowner is entitled to a judgment for damages resulting

from the buyer's refusal to complete the transaction.

(B) The homeowner is entitled to a judgment for specific performance

because every parcel of real estate is unique.

(C) The homeowner is entitled to a judgment for damages resulting

from the buyer's refusal to complete the transaction, and he is also

350

entitled to specific performance, because every parcel of real
estate is unique.

(D) The buyer is excused from performance because of impossibility.

166. Because he always wanted his nephew to live nearby, the landowner
offered to leave his nephew half of his estate if he agreed to move
back to the city. The nephew agreed. The nephew then asked his sister
if she would let him live in her apartment until the landowner died in
exchange for half of what he received from the landowner. The
landowner soon passed away.

The landowner's will left his entire estate to the nephew. The nephew
refused to share any portion of it with his sister. If there was an
enforceable agreement between the nephew and the landowner, his
sister is most correctly described as an

(A) intended creditor beneficiary of that agreement.

(B) intended donee beneficiary of that agreement.

(C) incidental beneficiary of that agreement.

(D) assignee of 50 percent of whatever rights the nephew has under that

agreement.

167. In exchange for use of his neighbor's boat, the homeowner hired a lawn

service to maintain his lawn and his neighbor's lawn for the next two
years. The homeowner and the lawn service signed a memorandum of
agreement, and the homeowner gave a photocopy of it to his neighbor.
The lawn service rendered services as agreed for six months. Then,
the lawn service notified the homeowner and the neighbor that it would
no longer be able to work on their lawns. The neighbor sued the lawn
service for breaching the agreement contained in the memorandum. The
court should find for

(A) the neighbor, because he is a creditor third-party beneficiary of the

contract between the lawn service and the homeowner.

(B) the neighbor, because the neighbor is a donee third-party

beneficiary of the contract between the lawn service and the
homeowner.

(C) the lawn service, because the neighbor is only an incidental third-
party beneficiary of the contract between the lawn service and the
homeowner.

351

(D) the lawn service, because there was no privity between the lawn

service and the neighbor.

168. On July 1, after hearing that the buyer was going to attend law school,
the seller sent the buyer a letter offering to sell his old law books. The
buyer wrote back on July 8 and told the seller he would buy the law
books for $100 if the seller delivered them to his apartment on
September 1. On August 1, the buyer decided that he did not want to go
to law school after all and wrote the seller a note telling him that he
was no longer interested in buying the law books. He was about to go
to the post office to mail it when the seller knocked at his door. As
soon as the buyer opened the door, the seller said, “I'll bring you those
law books tomorrow. I'll just have to borrow a friend's station wagon
to transport them.” The buyer said, “Never mind. I don't want them,”
and handed the seller the note that he had written but not mailed.

The seller's statement on August 1 that “I'll be bringing you those law
books tomorrow” was probably

(A) an offer.

(B) a ratification of the acceptance that was mailed on July 8 but was

never delivered to the buyer.

(C) an acceptance.

(D) commencement of performance.

169. A homeowner asked a builder to build a new pool in his backyard
while he was away on a three-week bus tour of Europe. The
homeowner and the builder signed a contract for 10 percent less than
the market price, and the homeowner signed a detailed work order for
the builder's work crew. Several days later, the work crew went out to
do the job described in the work order. By mistake, they installed the
pool in a neighbor's yard. Since the neighbor was on the same trip as
the homeowner, no one was around to tell the work crew they had the
wrong house. When the homeowner returned, he demanded the builder
perform the work as agreed. The builder refused, and the homeowner
sued.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would most likely result in a judgment for the builder?

(A) There is another builder who will build a pool for the homeowner

352

for the same price.

(B) The original contract would have resulted in a loss for the builder.

(C) The homeowner had accidentally written the wrong address in the

work order.

(D) The builder was unsuccessful in collecting payment from the

neighbor.

170. After a fire destroyed a storeowner's store, the storeowner entered into

a contract with a builder to rebuild the store for $200,000. The
contract called for work to be completed by December 1. After taking
a closer look at the work that needed to be done, the builder contacted
the storeowner and said he could not take on the job for less than
$275,000.

The storeowner quickly found another builder who was willing to do
the job for $250,000. After the second builder began work, the
storeowner contacted him and said that if he could finish the building
by November 1, the storeowner would pay him an extra $25,000. The
second builder completed the work by November 1, and the
storeowner paid him $275,000. The storeowner then sued the first
builder for damages resulting from breach of the original construction
contract. A court would likely award the storeowner

(A) nothing.

(B) $25,000.

(C) $50,000.

(D) $75,000.

171. An entrepreneur entered into a contract with a seller to buy a new

office building for his new company. Prior to the date set for closing,
the entrepreneur contacted the seller and said he was no longer buying
the building because the necessary funding for the company had not
come through. The seller did not try to resell the office building. A
year later, the seller sued the entrepreneur for breach of contract.

In deciding the lawsuit, the court should rule in favor of

(A) the entrepreneur, because the seller did not try to resell the office

building.

353

(B) the entrepreneur, under the doctrine of impossibility of

performance.

(C) the entrepreneur, because he notified the seller prior to the date set

for closing.

(D) the seller, for a sum equal to the difference between the contract
price and the fair market value of the property on the date set for
closing.

172. On June 2, a truck manufacturer and an engine maker entered into an
agreement for the sale of a new engine for $1,000. In a telephone
conversation with the engine maker on June 5, however, the truck
manufacturer said that he would sue the engine maker for breach of
contract unless the engine maker agreed to accept $200 as payment in
full. Because business was poor, the engine maker agreed to accept
that sum, but then she subsequently rejected the truck manufacturer's
tender of $200. If the engine maker sues the truck manufacturer for
$1,000, the court should find for

(A) the truck manufacturer, because the original agreement was

modified in the telephone conversation of June 5.

(B) the engine maker, because her agreement to accept $200 was not

evidenced by a writing.

(C) the engine maker, because her agreement to accept $200 was

unsupported by consideration.

(D) the engine maker, because her agreement to accept $200 was made

under duress.

173. Important as a food commodity, pears are traded on the American Pear
Exchange. Although farmers are free to negotiate prices for the sale of
their pears, the price received by pear farmers on any given day is
generally determined by the American Pear Exchange price.

In January, a farmer planted an orchard of pears that would be ready
for harvest in June. Because she expected the harvest to yield more
than 5,000 bushels of pears, she entered into a written contract with a
buyer on March 1, wherein the farmer agreed to sell and the buyer
agreed to buy 2,000 bushels of pears to be delivered during the month
of June at the American Pear Exchange price as of June 15. On March
2, the farmer entered into an identical written contract with a
restaurant.

354

In the first week of April, heavy rains inundated the farmer's orchard,
destroying part of her crop. As a result, she doubted that she would be
able to fulfill her contract. The farmer than called the buyer. When she
explained the problem to the buyer, he said that he would accept 1,000
bushels instead of 2,000 if the farmer would agree to accept the
American Pear Exchange price as of May 1 instead of June 15. The
farmer said, “Well, you've got me over a barrel. I'll never be able to
deliver 2,000 bushels in June, so I accept your terms.”

On May 1, the price was $2 per bushel. On June 16, the price of pears
doubled. The farmer's harvest yielded 4,000 bushels. The farmer
delivered 1,000 bushels to the buyer on June 20. The buyer demanded
the right to purchase another 1,000 bushels at $2 per bushel, but the
farmer refused to sell him an additional 1,000 bushels at that price. If
the buyer institutes a claim against the farmer for breach of contract,
the court should find for

(A) the farmer, because farmers are free to negotiate prices for the sale

of their pears.

(B) the farmer, because her agreement to accept the American Pear
Exchange price as of May 1 was consideration for the buyer's
agreement to accept 1,000 bushels instead of 2,000 bushels.

(C) the buyer, because the agreement to modify his contract with the

farmer was not in writing.

(D) the buyer, because the farmer's harvest was sufficient to permit her

to satisfy her original contractual obligations.

174. In August 2012, a bar owner threatened to sue the student for $10,000,

claiming that the student owed him that sum for unpaid bar bills. The
student asked his mother to lend him money with which to pay the bar
owner. On September 1, 2012, the student's mother stated orally that if
the student promised to go to law school and to stop drinking for the
rest of his life, she would give him $10,000 on July 1, 2013. The
student promised that he would never drink alcohol again, and that he
would enroll in law school as soon as possible. On September 3,
2012, the student wrote to the bar owner, describing his agreement
with his mother and stating that if the bar owner did not sue him, he
would pay the bar owner the $10,000 as soon as he received it from
his mother.

355

The student began attending a law school two weeks later. In
December 2012, however, he withdrew from the school, deciding that
he did not like it.

On July 1, the student's mother paid her son $10,000, but the student
refused to pay the bar owner, denying that he owed unpaid bar bills. If
the bar owner asserts a claim against the student for breach of the
promise contained in the student's letter of September 3, which of the
following additional facts, if it were the only one true, would be most
likely to result in a judgment for the bar owner?

(A) The bar owner did not respond to the student's letter of September

3.

(B) On September 3, the student reasonably believed that he owed the
bar owner $10,000, but the bar owner did not reasonably believe
that the student owed him $10,000.

(C) On September 3, the bar owner reasonably believed that the student

owed him $10,000, but the student did not reasonably believe that
he owed the bar owner $10,000.

(D) On July 1, the bar owner's claim against the student for unpaid bar

bills was barred by the statute of limitations.

175. The homeowner hired a famous landscaper to fix up his lawn. The
landscaper's design owner's house and planted with aquatic plants.
Although the landscaper completed the rest of the job himself, he hired
an earthmoving subcontractor to dig the moat, which the earthmoving
subcontractor did in complete conformity with the landscaper's plan.
The entire job was completed in a reasonably workmanlike manner,
but the homeowner refused to make any payment under the contract.

The landscaper asserted a claim against the homeowner on account of
the homeowner's refusal to pay him for his services, and the
homeowner defended on the ground that the landscaper breached the
contract by hiring a subcontractor to dig the moat. In deciding the
claim, the court should find for

(A) the homeowner, because the landscaper hired the earthmoving
subcontractor to dig the moat around the homeowner's house.

(B) the homeowner, because the reason that the homeowner contracted
with the landscaper was that he wanted the job done by a well-

356

known landscape architect.

(C) the landscaper, because the moat was dug in complete conformity

with the landscaper's plan.

(D) the landscaper, because all contract rights are freely assignable.

176. In exchange for use of his neighbor's ski house, the homeowner hired a
lawn service to maintain his lawn and his neighbor's lawn for the next
two years, agreeing to pay the lawn service $50 per month for certain
specified services. The homeowner and the lawn service signed a
memorandum of agreement, and the homeowner gave a photocopy of it
to his neighbor. Two months later, the homeowner sold his house to a
doctor. At the closing of title, the homeowner handed the doctor the
original memorandum of his agreement with the lawn service and
executed an assignment to the doctor of his rights thereunder. The lawn
service continued rendering services as agreed for an additional six
months, receiving a check for $50 from the doctor each month. Then,
the lawn service notified the neighbor and the doctor that it would no
longer be able to work on their lawns.

The neighbor hired a gardener to continue performing the same
services on the neighbor's lawn for a fee of $25 per month. If the
neighbor sues the doctor for $400 ($25 per month for the 16 months
remaining in the term), the court should find for

(A) the neighbor, because the doctor's monthly payments to the lawn
service resulted in an estoppel-type waiver of his rights to deny
liability.

(B) the neighbor, because the homeowner's promise to provide lawn

maintenance services touches and concerns the land.

(C) the doctor, because he did not agree to pay for the maintenance of

the neighbor's lawn.

(D) the doctor, because the price of $25 per month to maintain the
neighbor's lawn was equal to one-half the price that the lawn
service charged for maintaining both lawns.

177. On April 1, a law firm hired a famous and uniquely skilled software

specialist to design and install new computer software specifically for
the firm. The new software was to be installed by October 1. On
August 15, after winning the state lottery, the specialist sold her
business to a computer dealer. The computer dealer agreed to fulfill

357

any existing contracts entered into by the specialist.

On August 16, the specialist informed the firm of her sale to the dealer,
stating that the software called for by the contract would be designed
and installed by the dealer and not the specialist. If the firm institutes a
claim against the specialist on August 18, the court should find for

(A) the firm, since the specialist's statement on August 16 was an

anticipatory repudiation.

(B) the firm, since the specialist's sale to the dealer did not impose on

the dealer an obligation to design software.

(C) the specialist, since design and installation of the software was not

required until October 1.

(D) the specialist, since her sale to the dealer implied a delegation of

all her obligations under her contract with the firm.

178. On May 15, a music store telephoned a guitar factory and ordered 50

guitars at a price of $200 per guitar. On May 16, the music store sent a
signed letter marked “Confirmation” that read: “This confirms our
order of 5 guitars.” On May 17, the factory shipped 50 guitars to the
store. On May 18, the factory received the letter from the music store.
On May 19, the factory sent a bill to the store for $10,000. On May 20,
the music store received the bill. On May 21, the music store sent back
the 50 guitars with a letter marked “Failure to Order” that read: “We
never ordered these.” On May 22, the factory received the letter. The
factory can make all of the guitars it has customer orders for, and it
makes a profit of $50 per guitar.

May the factory recover on the contract against the music store?

(A) Yes, for $10,000.

(B) Yes, for $2,500.

(C) Yes, for $250.

(D) No.

179. A local school held a charity auction where companies and other

members of the community donated items for the school to auction off.
A local guitar maker agreed to donate a new electric guitar valued at
over $1,500. During the auction, the plaintiff bid $50 and was
declared the highest bidder. The plaintiff gave the school a check for

358

$50. Because the guitar company was so embarrassed at the low price
paid for the guitar, it refused to deliver it to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff
asserts a claim against the guitar company for failing to deliver the
guitar, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, as an assignee.

(B) the plaintiff, as an intended third-party creditor beneficiary.

(C) the guitar company, because there was no agreement between it and

the plaintiff.

(D) the guitar company, because the agreement was not supported by

consideration.

180. A famous musician was scheduled to play a concert that would be

broadcast on national television. A music-streaming service that had
an exclusive agreement with the musician contracted with the
television network to run a 30-second advertisement on Saturday,
October 1, at 8:15 P.M. Although the contract did not state it
specifically, the understanding was that the advertisement would run
during the last 15 minutes of the concert. The advertisement was
designed to promote the music-streaming service by advertising the
musician's “surprise” new album that was exclusive to the site.

The day before the concert, the musician was killed in a car accident.
The television station offered to run the advertisement at the agreed
time for a 20 percent discount, but the music service declined, stating
that the entire advertisement and advertising campaign was built
around the concert occurring. If the television station sues the music-
streaming service for breach of contract, how should the court rule?

(A) For the television station, because the contract did not specifically

state the advertisement would run during the concert.

(B) For the television station, since there was nothing stopping it from

running the advertisement at the agreed time.

(C) For the music-streaming service, under the doctrine of

impossibility.

(D) For the music-streaming service, under the doctrine of frustration of

purpose.

ANSWERS TO 
CONTRACTS QUESTIONS

1.  D  The  plaintiff's  father's  offer  was  for  a  unilateral  contract  —  his
promise  to  pay  in  return  for  the  plaintiff's  postponing  the  wedding.
When  the  plaintiff  postponed  the  wedding,  he  accepted  his  father's
offer, and a contract was formed.

Some  cases  have  held  that  an  agreement  never  to  marry  violates
public policy, but there is no reason why an agreement to postpone a
marriage  would  do  so.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect
because  the  plaintiff's  father's  promise  was  to  pay  if  the  plaintiff
postponed  the  wedding.  His  language  did  not  make  payment
conditional  upon  the  plaintiff's  registration  for  a  second  year.
Although  an  offer  terminates  upon  the  death  of  the  offeror,  C  is
incorrect  because  the  plaintiff  accepted  the  offer  by  postponing  the
wedding, and, once accepted, an offer is no longer revocable.

2. D Since the dealer sold the chairs to another buyer at the same price that
the  decorator  had  contracted  to  pay,  the  dealer  sustained  no  damage.
Where there is no limit to the availability of the items sold, some cases
allow a seller to recover lost profits when a buyer cancels, reasoning
that  even  though  the  seller  resold  at  the  same  price,  he  or  she  would
have  made  two  sales  instead  of  one  if  the  buyer  had  not  breached.
Since  there  were  no  more  chairs  to  sell,  however,  the  dealer  lost
nothing.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  An  action  for  the  price  might  be  available
where traditional calculation of damages would be inadequate, but B
is incorrect because the dealer has suffered no damages. C correctly
states the remedy that would have been available to the decorator in
the  event  of  a  breach  by  the  dealer.  Because  the  fair  market  value
exceeds  the  contract  price,  however,  the  formula  expressed  in  C
bears no relationship to damages suffered by the dealer as a result of
the decorator's breach. C is therefore incorrect.

3. A If an event that was not foreseeable to the parties at the time a contract
was  formed  makes  performance  of  the  contract  impossible,  such
performance  is  excused.  In  the  absence  of  facts  that  specifically
suggest  the  contrary,  destruction  of  the  subject  matter  of  a  contract  is
usually  held  to  have  been  unforeseeable  by  the  parties  at  the  time  of

361

contracting.

At the time the fire occurred, the plaintiff was not in breach because
he  was  not  required  to  make  payment  until  the  garage  was  half
complete,  and  the  defendant  was  not  in  breach  because  he  was  not
required  to  be  half  finished  until  April  25.  B  and  C  are  therefore
incorrect.  It  is  usually  held  that  impossibility  excuses  performance
only  to  the  extent  that  performance  has  been  made  impossible.  D  is
incorrect, however, because the contract was not for labor until June
1, but rather for construction of the garage by June 1, and the fire has
made completion by that date impossible.

4. A The UCC provides that where there is no agreement to the contrary, a
buyer is entitled to inspect goods prior to making payment or accepting
them.  It  provides  further,  however,  that  the  parties  may  agree  that
payment is required before inspection. If so, failure to make payment
upon delivery of the goods is a breach.

Anticipatory  repudiation  occurs  when,  prior  to  the  time  when
performance is required, a party indicates by word or deed that he or
she will not perform. B is incorrect because the buyer's refusal to pay
occurred at the time payment was required, and therefore constituted
a  breach.  The  UCC  provides  that  even  if  payment  is  made  prior  to
inspection,  no  acceptance  occurs  until  after  the  buyer  has  had  a
reasonable  opportunity  to  inspect.  In  view  of  this  provision,  a
promise  to  pay  prior  to  inspection  is  not  unconscionable,  and  C  is
incorrect.  Since  the  seller  tendered  delivery  in  accordance  with  the
terms of the contract, D is incorrect.

5.  A  A  unilateral  contract  is  a  promise  to  perform  in  exchange  for  a
specified  act  by  the  promisee.  Since  the  company  promised  to  make
payment  to  the  employee  who  submitted  the  winning  design,  its  offer
was for a unilateral contract.

A bilateral contract is an exchange of promises, each given in return
for  the  other.  Since  the  company  promised  to  pay  only  if  the
modification design was actually submitted, and asked for no promise
in return for its promise to pay, B is incorrect. The company's notice
made clear its intention to pay only one prize and its obligation to pay
only upon receipt of a design that complied with its requirements. Its
promise,  therefore,  could  not  have  been  given  in  exchange  for  the
promise contained in the engineer's March 8 memo, even if that memo

362

had  been  received.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  key  difference
between an offer and an invitation to negotiate is that an offer creates
an immediate power of acceptance in the offeree. Since any employee
could have accepted the company's offer of a reward by successfully
designing  and  submitting  the  required  program  modification,  D  is
incorrect.

6. B If a promise not to assign a contract is enforceable, it is like any other
promise, in that damages may be available as a remedy for its breach.
An assignment made in violation of such a promise is usually regarded
as  valid,  however.  This  means  that  even  though  the  gardener  may  be
entitled  to  recover  from  the  owner  for  damages  resulting  from  the
owner's  assignment  to  the  plaintiff,  the  plaintiff  may  enforce  the
contract against the gardener.

C  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  is  incorrect  because  a  promise  not  to
assign  without  a  party's  consent  does  not  require  that  party  to  act
reasonably  in  deciding  whether  or  not  to  consent.  It  is  generally
understood  that  a  contract  involving  personal  services  is  not
assignable because an assignment of such a contract may increase the
obligor's  burden.  Since  the  contract  between  the  owner  and  the
gardener  specified  the  tasks  that  the  gardener  was  to  perform,  and
since a change in obligee (i.e., in the ownership of the condominium)
would  not  alter  those  tasks,  assignment  to  the  plaintiff  did  not
increase  the  gardener's  burden.  For  this  reason,  the  contract  should
not  be  regarded  as  one  calling  for  personal  services,  and  D  is
incorrect.

7.  C  Consideration  is  a  benefit  to  the  promisor  or  a  detriment  to  the
promisee that was bargained for and given in return for the promisor's
promise.  For  this  reason,  if  the  police  officer  did  something  that  he
was already obligated to do, his act could not be consideration for the
city's promise to pay since no new benefit was given to the city and no
detriment was sustained by the police officer in return for that promise.
A  police  officer's  obligation  to  his  employer  includes  the  duty  to
attempt  to  apprehend  criminals,  so  the  police  officer's  performance
was of a preexisting duty.

A is incorrect because establishing that the informant is entitled to the
reward  does  not  necessarily  establish  that  the  police  officer  (or
anybody  else)  is  not  entitled  to  it  as  well.  B  is  incorrect  because  a
guilty  plea  is  a  conviction.  Since  the  city's  promise  was  to  pay  in

363

return for information leading to a conviction, it was an offer to pay
for something of value, not an offer for a gratuitous cash award. D is
therefore incorrect.

8. D The parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence
of  prior  or  contemporaneous  agreements  offered  to  contradict,  vary,
or modify an unambiguous writing that the parties intended to be a full
and  final  expression  of 
their  agreement  (i.e.,  a  “complete
integration”).  Since  the  “dollar”  is  the  unit  of  currency  in  both  the
United  States  and  the  foreign  country,  the  contract  that  specifies  a
price of 9,000 dollars without identifying which country's dollars are
intended is probably ambiguous. The evidence offered by the plaintiff
would help explain and clarify the ambiguity. It is not barred by the
parol evidence rule since it does not contradict, vary, or modify the
writing.

A  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  Ambiguities  in  a  writing  are
frequently  construed  against  the  party  who  prepared  it,  but  only  if
they  cannot  be  clarified  in  some  other  way.  B  is  incorrect  because
parol evidence may be introduced to explain an ambiguity, no matter
who caused it.

9. D  The  man  made  no  express  promise  to  pay  for  the  fishing  gear.  There
was  no  implied  promise  because  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  the
plaintiff acted with the expectation of compensation or reimbursement
for her losses. The executor is therefore not bound to pay for her loss.

Quantum meruit is available to prevent unjust enrichment only where
services were rendered under circumstances such that the party from
whom payment is sought was aware of the other party's expectation of
payment. A is therefore incorrect. The phrase “danger invites rescue”
has  been  used  in  tort  cases  to  explain  why  one  who  creates  a  peril
owes a duty of care to a person attempting to rescue another from it.
B is incorrect, however, because the principle has no application in
contract problems. Since there is no indication that the man promised
to pay for the fishing gear, the fact that someone else in his position
would have is irrelevant, making C incorrect.

10.  A  Performance  of  one  of  a  series  of  mutual  promises  is  a  condition
precedent  to  others  in  the  series  if  the  circumstances  indicate  that  it
should  obviously  precede  the  others.  Since  the  writing  called  for
payment  of  $300  in  advance,  it  is  obvious  that  the  parties  intended

364

that  it  should  be  paid  before  the  work  commenced.  The  woman's
payment  of  $300  was  thus  a  condition  precedent  to  the  body  shop's
obligation  to  paint.  Since  the  contract  called  for  the  payment  of  an
additional  $400  after  completion,  it  is  obvious  that  the  parties
intended  that  the  paint  job  should  be  finished  before  payment  of  the
additional money was required. Completion of the paint job is thus a
condition  precedent  to  the  woman's  obligation  to  pay  the  additional
$400.

A condition subsequent is an event the occurrence or non-occurrence
of  which  operates  to  discharge  a  duty  that  had  already  become
absolute. Since the body shop was obligated to paint before receiving
the additional $400, and since it could not undo the paint job once it
was  completed,  the  woman's  payment  of  the  additional  $400  cannot
be  called  a  condition  subsequent  to  the  body  shop's  obligation  to
paint the car. B is therefore incorrect. Concurrent conditions require
the  parties  to  exchange  performance  simultaneously.  C  is  incorrect
because the language of the contract makes it obvious that the parties
intended  a  consecutive  order  of  performance  (i.e.,  the  woman  pays
$300,  the  body  shop  completes  paint  job,  the  woman  pays  $400).
Since  the  agreement  required  partial  payment  in  advance  and
completion of the job before the balance was due, D is incorrect.

11. C  In  an  action  for  breach  of  an  employment  contract,  a  non-breaching
employee is entitled to receive the full contract price for the balance
of  the  term  plus  consequential  damages,  less  damages  avoided  by
mitigation. Since the plaintiff mitigated damages by taking a job with
another  company  at  the  same  salary,  he  is  entitled  to  what  he  lost
between  the  discharge  and  the  beginning  of  his  new  job.  His
advertising expenses are collectible as consequential damages.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  reorganization  by  the  defendant  was
voluntary. An employment contract may require payment of severance
pay in the event of termination, but absent such agreement, there is no
such  legal  requirement.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because the plaintiff's work for the new company at the same salary
mitigated his damages.

12. A If the defendant's statement implied a promise to paint the cars, it was
an acceptance of the plaintiff's offer, thus forming a contract of which
the defendant's subsequent refusal to paint the cars would be a breach.
(Note:  Although  the  defendant's  statement  probably  was  not  a

365

promise,  the  question  requires  this  to  be  assumed  as  an  additional
fact.)

If, on the other hand, he made no promise to paint the cars, there was
no contract and could be no breach. This would be true even though
the  plaintiff  suffered  detriment  in  reliance  on  his  belief  that  the
defendant  would  paint  his  cars.  B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.
When  the  plaintiff  offered  $125  per  car,  he  rejected  the  defendant's
offer  to  paint  them  for  $150.  It  was  too  late  for  him  to  accept  that
offer on January 3, so D is incorrect.

13. D None of the reasons given to justify a victory for the defendant is a
good  one.  The  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose  may  excuse
performance  of  a  contract  when  an  unforeseen  event  destroys  its
underlying  purpose,  but  only  if  both  parties  knew  what  that  purpose
was.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff  did  not  know  the  defendant's
purpose.  Impossibility  of  performance  discharges  a  contractual
obligation  when  an  unforeseen  event  makes  performance  vitally
different  from  that  reasonably  contemplated  by  both  parties  at  the
time the contract was formed. B is incorrect because the plaintiff was
unaware of the use contemplated by the defendant. When government
action  makes  the  subject  matter  of  a  contract  unlawful,  it  may  be
unenforceable  for  illegality,  because  of  frustration  of  purpose,  or
under  the  doctrine  of  impossibility  of  performance.  C  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  subject  matter  of  the  contract  between  the
defendant and the plaintiff was the rental of a motion picture theater,
and the showing of motion pictures was not made unlawful by the city
council's action.

14. D The Statute of Frauds requires a contract for the sale of goods with a
price  of  $500  or  more  to  be  in  writing,  but  it  does  not  apply  to  a
contract for services, even if goods are to be provided by the person
performing the services.

15.  B  Usually,  a  promise  is  unenforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration  is  a  bargained-for  exchange  of  value
given  for  a  promise  and  may  consist  of  benefit  to  the  promisor  or
detriment to the promisee. If an alleged debt is invalid, a person who
promises to pay a sum in settlement of it receives no benefit in return
for  his  or  her  promise.  Similarly,  if  a  person  who  receives  such  a

366

promise  does  not  honestly  believe  that  the  debt  is  valid,  he  or  she
suffers no detriment by agreeing to accept less in settlement. For this
reason, a promise to pay a sum of money to settle a claim for debt is
supported by consideration if the debt is valid or the person asserting
the  claim  believes  that  it  is.  Thus,  if  the  plaintiff  honestly  believed
that the defendant owed him $3,000, his agreement to accept $2,000
was  consideration  for  the  defendant's  promise,  making  the  promise
enforceable.

On  the  other  hand,  if  the  plaintiff  did  not  believe  that  the  defendant
owed  him  the  money,  the  plaintiff  suffered  no  detriment  and  the
defendant  received  no  benefit  in  return  for  the  defendant's  promise.
Since  the  promise  would,  thus,  be  unsupported  by  consideration,  it
would  be  unenforceable.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  and  D  are
incorrect  because  unless  the  debt  actually  existed  or  the  plaintiff
believed  that  it  did,  his  agreement  to  accept  $2,000  would  not  be
consideration for the defendant's promise to pay it.

16. A Although the parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic
evidence  for  the  purpose  of  modifying  the  terms  of  certain  written
memorandums, it does not prevent the admission of such testimony for
the  purpose  of  establishing  that  no  contract  was  ever  formed.  Since
the oral agreement made before execution of the writing establishes a
condition precedent to the formation of a contract, it is admissible.

An agreement to modify a contract is one that is made after formation
of the contract. B  is  incorrect  because  the  oral  agreement  regarding
the loan was made before execution of the written contract. Since the
defendant has not asserted that the written agreement is valid, there is
no  reason  why  he  should  be  estopped  from  denying  that  it  is.  C  is
therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because the oral agreement relates
to the formation of the contract and does not modify or contradict its
terms.

17. A The Statute of Frauds requires a contract for the sale of goods with a
price  of  $500  or  more  to  be  in  writing.  It  might  be  argued  that  the
agreement in A was divisible — really 15 separate agreements, each
for a single $100 purchase — and therefore not within the Statute of
Frauds. (Note: Since the agreement was for the purchase of a “series”
of figurines, it was probably not a divisible contract, but A is the only
one of the four fact patterns presented in which the Statute of Frauds
might prevent enforcement.)

367

UCC  §2-201  specifically  excludes  from  application  of  the  statute  a
contract for the sale of specifically manufactured goods if the seller
has made a substantial beginning in their manufacture. The Statute of
Frauds  would  be  inapplicable  in  B  since  the  plaintiff  had  already
completed the rough carving when the defendant attempted to cancel
the contract. Since UCC §2-201 specifies that the Statute of Frauds is
satisfied  by  an  admission  in  the  pleadings  of  the  existence  of  a
contract, the statute would not prevent enforcement in C. UCC §2-201
provides  that  between  merchants,  a  written  memorandum  of  a
contract that is sufficient to bind the sender binds the receiver also if
he or she fails to object to it within 10 days. Since both parties in D
are merchants, the writing prepared by the plaintiff and not responded
to by the defendant satisfies the statute.

18.  B  A  minor  may  disaffirm  a  contract  on  the  ground  of  incapacity.  If,
however,  the  disaffirming  minor  is  the  plaintiff  in  an  action  for
restitution, his or her recovery will be offset by the reasonable value
of  the  benefit  that  he  or  she  had  received.  Measuring  the  benefit  in
terms of reasonable rental value is a common judicial approach.

A is therefore incorrect. C  is  incorrect  because  the  damage  that  the
car sustained is not related to the benefit that the plaintiff received. D
is incorrect because it fails to recognize the minor's right to disaffirm
the contract.

19. C  An  offer  may  be  revoked  at  any  time  prior  to  its  acceptance  and  is
effectively  revoked  when  the  offeree  learns  of  an  act  by  the  offeror
that is wholly inconsistent with the offer. The seller's offer to sell the
tractor to the buyer was thus revoked when the buyer learned that the
seller had sold it to the other neighbor.

The  seller's  promise  to  keep  the  offer  open  until  March  15  was
unsupported  by  consideration  and  therefore  was  not  enforceable.
Although  UCC  §2-205  makes  certain  firm  offers  between  merchants
enforceable without consideration, A is incorrect because the seller
and the buyer were not merchants regarding the sale of the tractor. B
is  incorrect  because  the  revocation  took  effect  when  the  buyer
learned of the sale to the other neighbor. D is incorrect because the
letter of February 15 was an offer to sell the tractor and could have
given  rise  to  a  contract  if  accepted  by  the  buyer  before  the  seller
revoked it.

368

20. A A court may reform a contract to reflect the intentions of the parties if,
as  a  result  of  inadvertence,  the  writing  does  not  actually  reflect  the
intentions.  In  determining  the  intentions  of  the  parties,  the  court  may
admit whatever evidence is relevant and material.

B  is  incorrect  because  UCC  §2-201  declares  that  a  writing  may
satisfy  the  Statute  of  Frauds  even  though  one  or  more  terms  (except
the  quantity  term)  are  omitted.  The  Universal  Commercial  Code
(UCC)  provides  that  parties  may  conclude  a  contract  for  sale  even
though the price is not settled, and that if they do, the price is to be the
reasonable  price  at  the  time  of  delivery.  C  is  incorrect,  however,
because the seller and the buyer did agree on a price. D is incorrect
because  parol  evidence  may  be  admitted  for  the  purpose  of
determining what the parties intended the price to be.

21.  C  The  parol  evidence  rule  prohibits  the  introduction  of  extrinsic
evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements to contradict, vary,
or modify an unambiguous writing that the parties intended to be a full
and final expression of their agreement. It is generally understood that
in the absence of fraud or mistake, a clause in a written contract that
states that the writing is intended to be a complete integration of the
agreement  between  the  parties  establishes  that  it  is  a  complete
integration.  If  so,  the  agreement  in  C  would  be  barred  by  the  parol
evidence  rule  since  it  was  a  contemporaneous  agreement  that
contradicts a term of the writing.

The purpose of the parol evidence rule is to discourage litigation by
encouraging parties to put their entire agreement in writing. Since this
purpose would not be served by prohibiting parol evidence regarding
the question of whether or not the obligations created by the writing
ever  came  into  being,  parol  evidence  pertaining  to  a  written
contract's becoming effective is admissible. A is therefore incorrect.
Since  the  writing  requires  the  homeowner  to  pay  for  the  paint,  the
agreements in B and D  do  not  modify  any  obligation  created  by  the
writing  and  so  would  probably  be  admitted.  B  and  D  are  therefore
incorrect.

22. A An agreement for the sale of goods FOB a particular place requires
the seller to load the goods on board a carrier at that place. Once the
seller  has  done  so,  the  buyer's  obligation  to  pay  the  seller  for  the
goods  becomes  complete.  Under  UCC  §2-210,  a  seller  who  has
completely  performed  may  assign  its  rights  even  if  terms  of  the

369

contract  prohibit  assignment.  Since  the  seller's  rights  have  been
assigned  to  the  plaintiff,  the  plaintiff  now  is  entitled  to  collect  the
price from the defendant.

B  correctly  states  the  remedy  usually  available  to  the  buyer  in  the
event of the seller's failure to deliver, but it is incorrect as a statement
of  the  seller's  remedy.  Payment  by  the  defendant  might  enrich  the
plaintiff, but since the plaintiff has given value for the assignment of
the  air-conditioning  company's  rights,  the  enrichment  would  not  be
unjust.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  So  long  as  assignment  does  not
impose an additional burden on the obligor, an assignment of contract
rights is enforceable in spite of a clause prohibiting it. D is therefore
incorrect.

23.  A  A  contract  is  formed  upon  acceptance  of  an  offer.  An  offer  is  a
manifestation of present intent to be bound to specific terms. Since the
niece's  letter  of  August  1  clearly  expressed  her  willingness  to  sell
each  of  the  paintings  to  the  dealer  for  $2,000,  it  was  an  offer.  An
acceptance occurs when the offeree communicates to the offeror that
he or she agrees to the terms of the offer. Since the dealer's telegram
clearly expressed her willingness to pay $2,000 for painting Number
30, it was an acceptance. A contract for the sale of painting Number
30 at a price of $2,000 was thus formed. For this reason, the niece's
action  for  breach  of  a  contract  to  purchase  the  painting  for  $3,000
must  fail  unless  there  has  been  an  enforceable  modification  of  the
original contract. Under UCC §2-209(3), a modification of a contract
must be in writing if the contract as modified is within the provisions
of the Statute of Frauds. Since, as modified, the oral contract between
the  niece  and  the  dealer  calls  for  the  sale  of  goods  with  a  price  in
excess  of  $500,  it  violates  the  Statute  of  Frauds  and  will  not  be
enforced over the dealer's objection. A is therefore correct.

Since an increase in the fair market value of the painting would not
satisfy the requirement of a writing, B is incorrect. A promise that is
not  supported  by  consideration  or  one  that  violates  the  Statute  of
Frauds may be enforceable if the promisee justifiably relies on it to
his or her detriment. C is incorrect, however, because reliance alone
is  insufficient  to  have  this  effect  and  because  there  is  no  indication
that  the  niece  changed  her  position  (i.e.,  relied).  Since  the  niece's
offer  of  August  1  called  for  acceptance  by  telegraphed  order,  the
dealer's  telegram  on  August  2  was  an  acceptance  even  though

370

payment had not been made. D is therefore incorrect.

24.  C  Assignment  of  a  contract  transfers  all  the  assignor's  rights  to  the
assignee.  After  the  assignment,  the  assignor  has  no  rights  in  the
contract and cannot sue to enforce it.

A is incorrect because assignment does not discharge the assignor of
his  or  her  obligations  under  the  contract.  There  is  a  presumption,
however,  that  an  assignment  of  rights  under  a  contract  includes  a
delegation  of  duties  as  well.  B  is  therefore  incorrect  because,  as
assignee, the new homeowner is obligated to make payment as agreed
by the original homeowner. Unless there is a clear agreement to the
contrary, a promise not to assign without consent of the other party is
usually viewed as a covenant. An obligee who breaches that covenant
by  assigning  may  be  liable  for  damages  to  the  obligor,  but  the
assignment is valid in spite of the no-assignment clause so long as it
imposes  no  additional  burden  on  the  obligor.  Since  the  contractor's
obligation after the assignment is identical to his obligation before the
assignment  (i.e.,  to  install  aluminum  sliding  on  the  outside  of  the
building),  there  is  no  reason  to  hold  the  assignment  invalid.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

25. B  The  UCC  treats  a  modification  of  a  contract  as  a  new  contract.  For
this reason, if the contract as modified falls within the provisions of
the  Statute  of  Frauds,  the  modification  must  be  in  writing.  UCC  §2-
209(3). Since the modification resulted in an agreement to sell goods
with a price of $500 or more, the Statute of Frauds requires a written
the  contract
memorandum.  The  absence  of  a  writing  makes 
unenforceable over the objection of the retailer.

A  contract  is  unconscionable  if  one  party  is  so  deprived  of  free
choice  that  he  or  she  is  forced  to  make  a  one-sided  bargain  that
favors  the  other  party.  Since  the  free  enterprise  system  sometimes
results in different prices being set by different suppliers of the same
commodity,  the  mere  fact  that  the  merchandise  was  available  at  a
lower price than that requested by the wholesaler is not sufficient to
make the agreement to pay the wholesaler's price unconscionable. A
is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because, under UCC §2-209(1),
an  agreement  to  modify  a  contract  may  be  enforceable  even  if  it  is
unsupported by consideration. D would be relevant if the wholesaler
attempted 
to  excuse  his  own  nonperformance  by  asserting
impossibility  or  frustration  of  purpose.  Since  the  retailer  agreed  to

371

the modification, however, the wholesaler's reason for requesting it is
irrelevant to its enforceability.

26. C  A  contract  is  formed  upon  acceptance  of  an  offer.  Since  the  buyer's
order identified the subject of the transaction, specified the quantity,
set forth price and terms, and called for shipment, it conferred upon
the  seller  the  power  to  create  a  contract  by  accepting  and  was,
therefore,  an  offer.  Under  UCC  §2-206(1)(b),  an  order  to  purchase
goods  for  prompt  shipment  calls  for  acceptance  either  by  prompt
shipment  or  prompt  promise  to  ship.  Since  the  seller  shipped  (i.e.,
accepted the offer) on April 28, the contract was formed on that date.

Catalogs  of  the  kind  used  by  the  seller  are  mere  invitations  to
negotiate because they are sent to a large number of buyers and do not
refer to specific items for sale but rather to types  of  items.  For  that
reason, the buyer's order could not constitute an acceptance. A and B
are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  contract  had
already been formed when the goods were shipped.

27.  A  Under  UCC  §2-314,  an  implied  warranty  of  merchantability
accompanies  every  sale  by  a  merchant  unless  disclaimed  by
unequivocal  language.  UCC  §2-316(3)(a)  specifically  provides  that
the phrase “as is” may be used to disclaim the warranty.

B is incorrect because the implied warranty may accompany the sale
of  a  used  product  as  well  as  a  new  one.  C  is  incorrect  because
liability  for  breach  of  warranty  does  not  depend  on  negligence  or
fault by the seller. Under UCC §2-315, an implied warranty that the
product  is  fit  for  the  buyer's  particular  purpose  accompanies  a  sale
only if the seller knows the buyer's purpose and knows also that the
buyer is relying on the seller's judgment in furnishing a product to suit
that purpose. D is incorrect, however, because the implied warranty
of merchantability does not require reliance on the seller's judgment.

28.  B  In  the  absence  of  an  agreement  to  the  contrary,  one  who  seeks  the
services  of  another,  knowing  that  the  other  expects  to  be  paid  for
those services, impliedly promises to pay for the services by availing
himself  or  herself  of  them.  Although  the  doctor  agreed  to  wait  for
payment  and  to  bill  the  defendant's  insurance  company  directly,
nothing  in  the  conversation  between  the  doctor  and  the  defendant
indicates  that  the  doctor  was  willing  to  look  solely  to  the  insurance
company for payment.

372

If  the  benefit  that  a  contract  confers  on  a  noncontracting  party  was
intended  to  satisfy  a  preexisting  obligation  owed  by  one  of  the
contracting  parties,  the  person  on  whom  the  benefit  is  conferred  is
called a creditor third-party beneficiary. Since the defendant's debt to
the doctor did not exist at the time the insurance contract was made,
the doctor could not have been a creditor beneficiary. A is therefore
incorrect. C and D are incorrect because, as noted above, nothing in
the conversation between the doctor and the defendant indicates that
the  doctor  agreed  to  look  solely  to  the  insurance  company  for
payment.

29. C When either party to a contract breaches it, the other party is excused
from further performance. Since the landowner breached by refusing
to  make  payment  as  required,  the  contractor  may  refuse  to  perform
any further work.

In addition, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages consisting
of the losses that he or she sustained as a result of the breach. This
may  include  profits  that  he  or  she  would  have  earned  if  the  breach
had not occurred. D is therefore incorrect. Ordinarily, lost profits are
measured by the balance of the contract price less whatever it would
have  cost  the  builder  to  complete  performance.  Since  the  amounts
specified  in  A  and  B  are  not  necessarily  based  on  this  measure,  A
and B are incorrect.

30. A An option is a promise to keep a particular offer open for a specified
period  of  time.  If  it  is  supported  by  consideration,  it  is  a  separate
contract  and  is  enforceable  during  the  specified  period.  Since  the
document  stated  that  the  landowner  received  $20  in  return  for  her
promise  to  keep  the  offer  open,  her  promise  was  supported  by
consideration  and  is  therefore  enforceable.  Many  cases  hold  that
consideration that is cited in a writing, but which was never actually
given  or  received, 
that  sham
consideration does not support a promise. A is correct in spite of this,
however, because the facts do not indicate that the landowner did not
receive  $20  from  her  son,  and  because  none  of  the  other  answers
listed could possibly be correct.

is  “sham  consideration,”  and 

An  attempted  testamentary  substitute  is  an  attempt  by  a  person  to
dispose of his or her property after death without the formality of a
will. Since all jurisdictions have statutes that impose certain formal
requirements  on  wills,  a  testamentary  substitute  that  fails  to  satisfy

373

these requirements is ineffective. Thus, if the document signed by the
landowner is an attempted testamentary substitute, the result would be
a judgment for the administratrix. B is therefore incorrect. To avoid
interfering  with  the  freedom  of  contract,  courts  do  not  ordinarily
inquire  into  the  adequacy  of  consideration.  This  is  particularly  true
where parties to a contract are related to each other, or where there is
some  other  reason  why  one  of  them  might  be  willing  to  accept  less
than  actual  value  from  the  other.  For  this  reason,  C  and  D  are
incorrect.

31. D A minor may disaffirm his contract on the ground that he or she lacked

capacity, but the party contracting with him or her may not.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Detrimental  reliance  is  sometimes
given  as  a  reason  for  enforcing  a  promise  that  was  unsupported  by
consideration.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  defendant's  promise  was
supported by consideration (i.e., the plaintiff's promise), making the
plaintiff's reliance irrelevant.

32. C Under the Statute of Frauds, a contract for the sale of any interest in
real  estate  must  be  in  writing,  and  the  writing  must  contain  all  the
essential  terms.  The  price  is  an  essential  term  in  a  contract  for  the
sale  of  realty,  since  the  court  will  be  unable  to  fashion  a  remedy
without it.

Although  UCC  §2-305(1)  makes  special  provision  for  contracts
between  merchants,  providing  that  a  contract  silent  as  to  price  is
presumed to be for a reasonable price, these provisions apply only to
the sale of goods and not to the sale of realty. A and B are therefore
incorrect. Since this contract does not satisfy the requirements of the
Statute of Frauds, it is unenforceable over objection, even though oral
evidence might establish the intentions of the parties with respect to
missing terms. D is therefore incorrect.

33. C Consideration requires a bargained-for exchange. Since the husband
did  not  ask  the  rescuer  to  save  his  wife,  the  rescuer's  doing  so  was
neither bargained for nor given in exchange for the husband's promise.

The  fact  that  a  promisor  calls  something  “consideration”  for  his  or
her promise does not make it so. A is incorrect because the service
was not given in exchange for the promise. Even though the service
rendered by the rescuer may have materially benefited the husband, it
is  not  consideration  for  the  husband's  promise  because  it  was  not

374

performed  in  exchange  for  the  promise.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  A
service  given  in  return  for  a  promise,  however,  would  be
consideration for the promise even if the value of the service cannot
be specified. D is therefore incorrect.

34. C  A  beneficiary  may  sue  the  promisor  only  if  the  beneficiary  was  an
“intended”  beneficiary.  The  test  for  an  “intended”  beneficiary  is
whether the circumstances show that the promisee intended to give the
beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance. Here, the woman
(the promisee) intended to give her niece the benefit of the value of
her house. Consequently, the niece can sue the woman's husband (the
promisor) for his failure to live up to his promise to his wife. A and
terms  “creditor”  and  “donee”

D  are

Restatement's  change  to  the  terms  “intended”  and  “incidental”
beneficiaries. B is incorrect because the failure to change the wills is
irrelevant to the analysis.

the 
rendered  obsolete  by 

35. D The seller's obligation under a contract of sale is to deliver goods that
conform in every way to the terms of the contract. Since the contract
called for delivery of 500 pens, delivery of anything less is a breach.
Since the seller failed to perform as promised, the buyer is entitled to
the  return  of  all  money  already  paid.  In  addition,  since  the  seller
breached the contract, the buyer is entitled to damages resulting from
the breach.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  buyer  is  not  required  to  accept  a
nonconforming tender. If a buyer chooses to accept a nonconforming
tender, he or she must pay the contracted price but is entitled to sue
for damages resulting from the seller's defective performance, so long
as he or she notifies the seller of his or her intention to do so. B is
therefore incorrect. On the other hand, if the tender does not conform
to  the  seller's  promise,  the  buyer  may  reject  it.  Having  done  so,  the
buyer is entitled to damages that resulted from the seller's breach. C
is incorrect because return of the buyer's advance payment may not be
sufficient to compensate the buyer for other damages that it sustained.
(Note: Damages are traditionally measured by the difference between
the contract price and the “cover price” or the fair market value of the
goods involved.)

36. D A party who wishes to make a contract may make statements that are
not offers but rather solicitations of bids. These bids are the basis of

375

preliminary  negotiations  and  cannot  be  accepted.  Here,  the  man
saying  “I  would  consider”  shows  his  statement  to  be  a  mere
solicitation  of  bids,  and  not  a  true  offer.  Consequently,  the  friend
cannot accept and no contract is formed. This makes A incorrect. B is
incorrect because detrimental reliance usually refers to the other party
beginning  performance  or  making  costly  preparations  in  anticipation
of  a  contract.  Here,  the  friend  buying  motorcycle  equipment  and  a
shed  is  unlikely  to  rise  to  this  level.  C  is  incorrect  because  a
statement of future intention is an announcement by a person that he or
she  intends  to  contract  in  the  future.  The  man's  statement  that  he
wanted  to  sell  his  motorcycle  did  not  show  that  he  necessarily
intended to make any contract in the future.

37.  B  Under  the  brokerage  contract,  transfer  of  title  was  a  condition
precedent to the defendant's obligation to pay a commission. There is
always an implied agreement, however, that a party will not willfully
prevent  the  performance  of  a  condition  to  his  or  her  obligation.  If
transfer of title was prevented by the defendant's willful breach of his
contract  with  the  buyer,  the  defendant  thus  violated  the  implied
agreement with the plaintiff and may be held liable for damages (i.e.,
the unpaid commission) that resulted.

Although  real  estate  brokerage  contracts  frequently  require  payment
of  the  commission  when  the  broker  procures  a  ready,  willing,  and
able  buyer,  A  and  C  are  incorrect  because  this  contract  was
conditioned  on  the  transfer  of  title.  “Frustration  of  purpose”  may
excuse performance of a contract where an unforeseen event destroys
the  underlying  reasons  for  performing  the  contract.  D  is  incorrect
because  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose  never  results  in
liability but rather excuses a party's failure to perform.

38. A An accord is a new obligation intended to take the place of an existing
one.  To  be  enforceable,  it  must  be  supported  by  consideration.  To
discharge  the  original  obligation,  it  must  actually  be  performed.
Performance of the new obligation is known as “satisfaction,” and it
is the satisfaction rather than the accord that discharges a contractual
obligation. The agreement of May 21 constituted an accord, but since
the buyer did not pay $45,000 in cash by May 25, there has been no
satisfaction and thus no discharge of his obligation to pay $50,000 as
originally agreed.

While a promise to perform a preexisting obligation is not valuable

376

consideration, B is incorrect because the buyer's original contractual
obligation was to pay before June 14, and his May 21 promise was to
pay by May 25. A novation is an agreement to substitute a third party
for  one  of  the  parties  to  the  contract.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  accord  without  satisfaction  does  not  work  to
discharge contractual obligations.

39.  C  Under  the  mailbox  rule,  an  acceptance  is  effective  when  sent.
However, if the offeror never receives the acceptance, the acceptance
has  to  be  properly  dispatched  in  order  to  create  a  contract.  Here,
since the facts state that the writer put the correct address and proper
postage  on  the  acceptance,  the  mailbox  rule  applies.  This  makes  A
and B incorrect. D is incorrect because even if the writer mailed her
acceptance, the mailbox rule would not apply if the acceptance was
not properly dispatched (i.e., she put the wrong address on it).

40. C Most jurisdictions agree that an offer for a unilateral contract cannot
terminate  once  the  offeree  begins  performance.  The  plaintiff's  extra
efforts  to  earn  “A”s  while  her  mother  was  alive  would  thus  have
prevented  her  mother's  death  from  terminating  the  offer.  Earning  the
“A”s  constituted  acceptance  of  the  offer  and  entitled  the  plaintiff  to
the promised bonus.

A is incorrect because there is no rule of law requiring a law student
to  use  his  or  her  best  efforts  while  in  law  school.  B  is  incorrect
because the plaintiff's efforts would have prevented termination of the
offer until she had a reasonable opportunity to complete performance.
Since her mother's promise was not made until after the plaintiff got
into  law  school,  and  since  the  plaintiff  did  not  apply  to  law  school
with any expectation of compensation from her mother, the plaintiff's
law  school  enrollment  was  not  relevant  to  the  enforceability  of  her
mother's promise. D is therefore incorrect.

41. B UCC §2-104 defines a merchant as a person who deals in goods of the
kind  involved  in  the  transaction,  one  who  by  his  or  her  occupation
holds  himself  or  herself  out  as  having  knowledge  peculiar  to  the
goods involved in the transaction, one to whom such knowledge may
be attributed by his or her employment, or a person who by his or her
occupation  holds  himself  or  herself  out  as  having  such  knowledge.
Since  the  buyer  in  B  is  not  in  the  bicycle  business,  does  not  hold
himself  or  herself  out  as  having  special  knowledge  of  bicycles,  and
does not employ a person who does so, he or she is not a merchant

377

under UCC §2-104.

The  seller  in  A  is  in  the  bicycle  business  and  therefore  deals  in
bicycles.  The  buyer  in  C  is  a  bicycle  mechanic,  and  as  such  holds
himself  out  as  having  special  knowledge  of  bicycles.  Special
knowledge  of  bicycles  may  be  attributed  to  the  buyer  in  D  because
she employed a bicycle mechanic to assist in making the purchase.

42. D A prospective inability to perform occurs when a party to a contract
has,  by  his  or  her  own  conduct,  divested  himself  or  herself  of  the
ability  to  perform.  A  party  who  justifiably  relies  to  its  detriment  on
another party's prospective inability to perform is discharged from its
obligations under the contract. Since the hotel executives learned that
the plaintiff had enlisted, and since this would make it impossible for
the plaintiff to perform, they were justified in hiring another caretaker.
Since the hotel ordinarily employed only one winter caretaker, hiring
the  new  caretaker  was  sufficiently  detrimental  to  excuse  it  from
performing its contract with the plaintiff.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  the  hotel  justifiably  relied  to  its
detriment  on  the  plaintiff's  prospective  inability  to  perform  when  it
hired the new caretaker upon learning of the plaintiff's enlistment. An
anticipatory repudiation occurs when a party refuses to perform even
though he or she is able to do so. C is incorrect because the plaintiff
never refused to perform.

43.  B  Ordinarily,  when  unforeseeable  circumstances  make  performance
impossible,  that  performance  is  excused.  When  this  occurs  after
performance has begun, the party who has performed is not entitled to
contract remedies, since there has been no breach by the other party.
In  construction  contracts,  if  the  contractor  is  hired  to  repair  an
existing building rather than build a new one, the contractor is entitled
to  recover  in  restitution  for  the  reasonable  value  of  the  work  done
prior to the destruction of the building. In contracts involving building
a  new  building,  contractors  are  not  permitted  any  recovery  in
restitution  for  the  work  that  was  destroyed,  because  no  benefit  was
conferred on the owner.

A and D are incorrect because the plaintiff did not fully perform, such
performance having become impossible without fault by either party.

44.  B  An  assignment  transfers  the  assignor's  rights  to  the  assignee,  thus
extinguishing  the  assignor's  rights  under  the  contract.  Since  the

378

plaintiff  has  assigned  his  rights  under  the  contract,  he  can  no  longer
enforce them.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  lack  of  contractual  capacity
makes a contract voidable only at the option of the person who lacked
it, and second, a minor has capacity to contract in connection with his
or  her  own  business  interests.  An  assignee's  failure  to  notify  the
obligor that an assignment has been made may result in a discharge of
the obligor's obligation to the assignee to the extent of payments that
the obligor made to the assignor. C is incorrect, however, because the
assignee's  failure  to  notify  does  not  alone  discharge  any  obligation
owed by the obligor. In some jurisdictions, an assignment of wages is
invalid.  D  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  if  the  assignment  is
invalid,  the  defendant  is  liable  to  the  plaintiff,  and  second,  the
assignment was of royalties, not of wages.

45. A The Statute of Frauds requires that a contract to create an interest in
land be in writing. Most states agree that this requirement applies to a
promise  to  create  a  leasehold  interest,  so  it  would  apply  to  both
promises made by the daughter.

The Statute of Frauds also requires a writing if the contract is one that
by its terms cannot be performed within one year. The promise that
the daughter made to her mother could be performed within one year
if her brother died during that period. The promise that the daughter
made to her brother could be performed within one year if their aunt
died  during  that  period.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  UCC  §2-201(1)
requires that a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or
more be in writing. C is incorrect, however, because a house is realty
rather than goods, and because the requirement of a writing is based
on  the  price  rather  than  the  value  of  goods  sold.  Consideration  is
something  of  value  given  in  return  for  a  promise,  but  it  is  not
necessary  that  the  consideration  flow  from  the  promisee  to  the
promisor.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  woman's  conveyance  to  her
daughter was consideration for her daughter's promise to the woman,
and  because  her  brother's  promise  to  share  the  inheritance  was
consideration  for  his  sister's  promise  to  him.  In  addition,  D  is
incorrect  because  the  lack  of  consideration  does  not  relate  to  the
assertion that an oral promise is unenforceable.

46. B  As  long  as  neither  party  has  fully  performed  a  contract,  the  parties
may agree to cancel the whole contract. Such an agreement is called a

379

mutual  rescission.  However,  when  parties  agree  to  a  mutual
rescission, most courts hold that neither party is obligated to pay for
any  benefits  already  received  under  the  contract.  A  is  incorrect
because  it  is  irrelevant  who  asked  to  get  out  of  the  contract  first.  C
and D are incorrect because parties are not obligated to pay for any
benefits they received under the contract before the mutual rescission.

47. A UCC §2-209(3) provides that an agreement to modify a contract must
be in writing if the contract as modified is within the provisions of the
Statute of Frauds. Since the contract as modified calls for the sale of
1,000  widgets  at  $10  per  widget  for  a  total  price  of  $10,000,  and
since  the  Statute  of  Frauds  requires  a  contract  for  the  sale  of  goods
with  a  price  of  $500  or  more  to  be  in  writing,  the  contract  as
modified falls within the provisions of the Statute of Frauds. Since it
is  not  in  writing,  it  is  not  enforceable  over  the  objection  of  the
plaintiff.

C  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  UCC  §2-209(1)
provides  that  an  agreement  to  modify  an  existing  contract  may  be
enforceable  without  consideration.  An  accord  is  an  agreement  to
substitute a new obligation for an existing one. To be enforceable, an
accord, like any other agreement, must be supported by consideration.
Since consideration is a detriment suffered in exchange for a benefit
received, and since the defendant suffered no detriment in return for
the reduction in his obligation, the agreement to accept 1,000 widgets
instead of 2,000 as originally required by the contract is unsupported
by consideration. D is therefore incorrect.

48. A Although the defendant breached his contract with the plaintiff, he is
not  liable  unless  the  breach  resulted  in  damage.  If  there  are  equally
competent gardeners in the area who will perform the same work at
the same price, the plaintiff has sustained no damage as a result of the
defendant's failure to perform.

An increase in the costs of labor and materials would not excuse the
defendant  from  performance,  since  such  increases  are  usually
regarded as foreseeable to the parties at the time they contract. B is
therefore incorrect. The agreement between the man and the plaintiff
may have motivated the plaintiff to contract with the defendant, but C
is incorrect because the defendant's obligation does not depend on the
validity  of  the  plaintiff's  motivation.  A  party's  inability  to  perform
does  not  excuse  performance  unless  the  inability  was  unforeseeable

380

at the time the contract was made. Since the likelihood that one of the
parties  to  a  contract  will  become  ill  is  generally  regarded  as
foreseeable, D is incorrect.

49. D The note that the contractor sent on September 5 demanding $325 was
a rejection of the homeowner's offer to pay $300. An offeree who has
killed an offer by rejecting it does not have the power to resurrect it
by  a  subsequent  acceptance.  The  contractor's  note  of  September  12
was thus no more than a new offer. Since an offer may not make the
offeree's silence an acceptance, the contractor's offer of September 12
was never accepted because the homeowner did not respond to it.

A is therefore incorrect. Since there was no existing offer that could
be  accepted  by  performance,  the  contractor's  commencement  of
performance  on  September  28  could  not  have  resulted  in  the
formation of a contract, making B incorrect. Since the homeowner did
not know that the contractor was installing the screens, and since the
contractor did not have a reasonable expectation of compensation at
the  time  he  installed  them,  the  contractor  has  no  quasi-contract
remedy, and C is incorrect.

50. B Parties to a contract may make an explicit agreement as to what each
party's  remedy  for  a  breach  of  contract  will  be.  However,  such
“liquidated damages clauses” are invalid if they act as a penalty. The
purpose of damages is to put the plaintiff in the same position he or
she  would  have  been  in  had  the  contract  been  fulfilled.  It  is  not  to
punish the defendant for breach. Importantly, where a damage clause
is  keyed  to  the  plaintiff's  lost  gross  revenues,  lost  profits,  or  other
figure not necessarily tied to actual losses, the court is likely to find it
an unenforceable penalty. Here, the clause is an unenforceable penalty
because the plaintiff gets paid the same amount regardless of whether
it  had  to  do  any  work,  and  thus  regardless  of  whether  it  incurred
operating costs in performing the work. Consequently, the clause has
no  connection  to  the  nature  of  the  breach,  and  is  an  unreasonable
estimate  of  potential  losses  to  the  plaintiff.  A  is  incorrect  because,
although the clause is a poor estimate of actual losses, a court will not
enforce it because it rises to the level of an unenforceable penalty. C
is incorrect because the clause was not a reasonable estimation of the
damages. D is incorrect because there is no indication this agreement
is  so  complicated  or  the  industry  so  volatile  as  to  make  damages
difficult to calculate.

381

51. D Even if parties do not expressly exchange an offer and acceptance, if
they indicate by their conduct their understanding that a contract was
formed,  an  implied-in-fact  contract  exists.  Importantly,  if  an  offeree
silently receives the benefit of the offeror's services, a court will hold
that the offeree accepted a contract for those services if he or she had
a  reasonable  opportunity  to  reject  them  and  knew  or  should  have
known that the offeror expected to be compensated. Here, the woman
had a reasonable opportunity to reject the writer's services (they met
each other for an hour over four weeks), and she knew that the writer
was  usually  compensated  at  $50  an  hour  for  writing  lessons.
Consequently, an implied-in-fact contract was formed for the lessons
at  the  writer's  usual  rate.  A  is  incorrect  because  an  implied-in-fact
contract was formed under these facts. B is incorrect because market
value is irrelevant to the analysis. C is incorrect because there is no
fact  indicating  that  the  writer  was  intending  to  make  a  gift  of  her
services.

52.  D  Ordinarily,  a  promise  to  perform  services  implies  a  promise  to
perform  them  in  a  satisfactory  manner,  judged  by  an  objective
standard. A specific agreement that personal satisfaction is required,
however,  is  usually  understood  to  call  for  subjective  satisfaction  so
long  as  the  party  whose  satisfaction  is  required  acts  in  good  faith.
Thus, if the mayor actually believed that the statue was too small, and
he  was,  therefore,  not  subjectively  satisfied  with  it,  the  town  is
discharged of its obligation under the contract.

A is therefore incorrect. If the mayor liked the statue but rejected it
because  he  feared  embarrassment  resulting  from  a  conviction,  the
town would be in breach because the rejection would not be in good
faith.  If  he  genuinely  did  not  like  the  statue,  however,  the  incidental
fact that he feared embarrassment if the boxer was convicted would
not be relevant. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Although  the  clause  called
for subjective satisfaction, it did not create an absolute right to reject
the  work  since  such  an  agreement  is  understood  to  mean  that  the
decision as to whether or not the work is satisfactory must be made in
good faith. C is therefore incorrect.

53. A Promissory estoppel is used by the courts to enforce promises when
the promise induces the promisee to rely on it to his or her detriment.
Here, the plaintiff relied on the promise to her detriment because she
retired when she could have gone on working based on her belief that

382

she  would  receive  a  pension.  Consequently,  the  promise  can  be
enforced  through  promissory  estoppel.  B  is  incorrect  because  “past
services are not valid consideration for a promise.” Consequently, the
plaintiff's years of service prior to the awarding of the pension were
not consideration for the pension. C is incorrect because, although she
worked a few more years after receiving the pension, it was clear this
service  was  not  a  bargained-for  exchange  for  the  pension.  D  is
incorrect  because,  although  there  was  no  consideration  for  the
pension, it could still be enforced through promissory estoppel.

54. C UCC §2-512(2) specifically provides that where a contract calls for
payment  prior  to  inspection,  such  payment  does  not  constitute
acceptance and does not impair the buyer's right to inspect.

The requirement of payment prior to inspection is not an uncommon
one, and therefore not unconscionable, making A incorrect. B and D
are 
incorrect  because  UCC  §2-512(2)  prevents  preinspection
payment from having these effects.

55.  A  Since  the  promise  to  keep  the  offer  open  is  unsupported  by
consideration, it is a gratuitous one, and therefore unenforceable.

Although  UCC  §2-205  makes  certain  “firm  offers”  between
merchants  enforceable  without  consideration,  at  common  law,  an
option (i.e., promise to hold an offer open) is not enforceable without
consideration.  B  is  incorrect  because  it  is,  thus,  based  on  an
inaccurate  statement  of  the  law.  C  is  incorrect  because  UCC
provisions relating to “firm offers” apply only when they are made by
merchants. D is incorrect for these reasons and also because nothing
in  the  language  of  the  buyer's  letter  indicates  that  the  buyer's
beginning  law  school  is  a  condition  for  any  of  the  obligations  that
might  result  from  the  transaction.  It  clearly  was  not  a  condition
precedent  because  performance  was  to  take  place  prior  to  the
beginning of law school in mid-September.

56. B Although the Statute of Frauds might require a contract for the sale of
goods with a price of $1,000 to be in writing, the question asks only
if  the  neighbor's  promise  can  be  viewed  as  consideration  for  the
man's promise. Consideration is something of value that is bargained
for and given in exchange for a promise. Since the neighbor's promise
to  deliver  fire-fighting  equipment  is  of  obvious  value  to  the  man,  if
given in return for the man's promise of payment, it is consideration

383

for it.

A is incorrect because the neighbor's prior services were not given in
exchange for the man's promise. C is incorrect because the doctrine
of  promissory  estoppel  may  make  a  contract  enforceable  in  the
absence of consideration, but although detrimental reliance may take
the  place  of  consideration,  it  is  not  consideration  unless  bargained
for.  Although  the  kind  of  written  memorandum  referred  to  in  D
sometimes satisfies the requirement of a writing, it is not relevant to
the question of consideration or the lack of it.

57. C  UCC  §2-306  states  that  “a  term  which  measures  the  quantity  by  the
output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual
output  or  requirements  as  may  occur  in  good  faith,  except  that  no
quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the
absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable
prior  output  or  requirements  may  be  tendered  or  demanded.”
Comment 2 to §2-306 states that requirements and output contracts do
not  “lack  mutuality  of  obligation  since  under  this  section,  the  party
who  will  determine  quantity  is  required  to  operate  his  plant  or
conduct  his  business  in  good  faith  and  according  to  commercial
standards of fair dealing in the trade so that his output or requirements
will  approximate  a  reasonably  foreseeable  figure.”  Under  a
requirements contract, the buyer promises that he or she will buy all
of his or her requirements from the seller. This promise, coupled with
the  buyer's  good  faith  obligation  to  order  reasonable  quantities,
constitutes consideration for the seller's counter-promise to meet the
buyer's needs. Here, the airline bound itself to act reasonably and in
good  faith  in  estimating  the  quantities  of  fuel  it  required.  Since  the
airline was bound, the supplier's return promise was not void for lack
of mutuality of obligation. Consequently, B is incorrect. A and D are
incorrect because part of the purpose of a requirements contract such
as  this  one  is  to  receive  goods  at  predictable  price.  Thus,  wars
pushing up prices and other price increases are likely foreseeable.

58. B An assignment is effective only if the assignor has given up all rights
under the assigned contract. Thus, if the singer has made an effective
assignment, he no longer has any rights against the defendant.

A  is  incorrect  for  several  reasons:  First,  since  the  contract  was  for
the  singer's  business,  the  singer's  infancy  is  probably  irrelevant;
second, even if the singer's infancy at the time of his contract with the

384

defendant  is  relevant,  it  makes  the  contract  voidable  at  the  singer's
option,  not  the  defendant's;  and,  third,  if  the  singer's  infancy
invalidated  the  assignments,  the  defendant  would  not  benefit  in  the
singer's action against it. C is incorrect because the agreement was to
pay  for  the  recording  session  whether  or  not  a  record  was  ever
released. D is incorrect because the singer was probably a contractor
rather  than  an  employee  and  because  if  the  assignments  were  held
invalid, the defendant would have to pay the singer.

59.  C  A  condition  precedent  is  an  event  that  must  occur  before  a  party's
obligation  to  perform  under  a  contract  becomes  absolute.  Since  the
agreement provided that the defendant would be under no obligation
to  pay  unless  he  was  satisfied  with  the  product,  satisfaction  was  a
condition precedent to his obligation to accept and pay for the door.
Ordinarily,  a  contract  making  a  buyer's  satisfaction  a  condition
precedent to his or her obligation is held to require that the goods be
satisfactory  to  the  reasonable  person  (i.e.,  objective  satisfaction).
However, where the agreement calls for the design of something to be
personally identified with the buyer, as here, it is more likely that the
parties intended the buyer's own personal satisfaction (i.e., subjective
satisfaction)  to  be  the  standard.  If  so,  the  defendant's  dissatisfaction
with  the  product,  so  long  as  it  was  based  on  good  faith,  would
prevent  the  defendant  from  being  obligated  to  purchase  the  door.
While it is not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the
argument  set  forth  in  C  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly
support the defendant's position.

A is incorrect because the Statue of Frauds does not apply to goods
that are specially designed for the buyer and which, therefore, would
not be readily salable in the regular course of business. A unilateral
contract is one in which the promisor has agreed to do something in
return for a specified act by the promisee (i.e., a promise for an act),
and, therefore, one in which only one party is bound to perform. B is
incorrect  because  the  agreement  between  the  defendant  and  the
plaintiff  was  an  exchange  of  promises,  each  party's  promise  being
given  in  exchange  for  the  other  party's  promise  (i.e.,  a  bilateral
contract). If the plaintiff were able to sell the door to another buyer,
her  damages  might  be  mitigated  to  some  extent.  D  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  mere  possibility  that  damages  might  thus  be
mitigated is not sufficient to defeat the plaintiff's substantive rights.

385

60. B Even if a defendant can show that a plaintiff never overtly bargained
for  the  defendant's  promise  to  do  something,  as  long  as  a  court
concludes that the defendant's promise induced the plaintiff's promise
or performance, the fact that the defendant didn't expressly bargain in
return for that promise doesn't matter. Here, there was consideration
because  the  landfill  offered  the  plastic  for  free  because  it  wanted
someone else to come remove it, and thus save the landfill the cost of
disposing of the plastic itself.

A is incorrect because there is no fact showing that the construction
firm  detrimentally  relied  on  the  landfill's  promise  (e.g.,  buying  a
special  machine  for  the  plastic,  etc.).  C  is  incorrect  because  the
“bargain”  theory  of  consideration  does  not  mean  the  parties  must
actually bargain over the terms of the agreement — it just means the
promise made by the defendant and the detriment to the plaintiff must
induce each other. D is incorrect because this was not a gift situation.
The landfill wanted to have the plastic hauled away for free, and the
construction firm wanted the plastic and agreed to do so.

61. A Specific performance is a remedy that may coexist with the remedy of
damages. Thus, its availability does not depend on the availability of
damages — liquidated or otherwise.

B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect,  since  specific
performance  is  available  as  a  remedy  for  the  seller's  breach  of  a
contract for the sale of realty.

62. B The parol evidence rule prohibits the admission of extrinsic evidence
of  a  prior  or  contemporaneous  agreement  to  contradict,  vary,  or
modify  the  terms  of  an  unambiguous  written  contract  that  the  parties
intended  to  be  a  final  and  complete  expression  of  their  agreement.
Almost  all  jurisdictions,  however,  permit  extrinsic  evidence  to  be
used to establish that the writing is ambiguous, and, if so, to explain
the ambiguity.

A is incorrect since it does not recognize that oral testimony may be
used to explain the ambiguity. C is incorrect for the same reason, in
spite of a general rule of construction that requires the resolution of
unexplained ambiguities against the party who drafted the contract. D
is  incorrect  since  even  if  the  writing  was  a  complete  expression  of
the  parties'  agreement,  oral  testimony  is  admissible  to  explain
ambiguities.

386

63.  D  A  promise  to  forbear  or  abandon  a  civil  claim  in  return  for  some
payment by the promisee is referred to as a compromise. The promise
to  forbear  is  sufficient  consideration  for  the  promisee's  promise  to
pay if the claim could have been asserted in good faith. Although the
facts do not indicate whether the plaintiff believed in good faith that
he  had  a  claim  against  the  mother,  D  is  the  only  theory  listed  that
might have any prospect of success.

A is incorrect since the husband's promise was given in exchange for
the  plaintiff's  “promise  to  make  no  claim,”  and  a  unilateral  contract
involves a promise that is given in exchange for an act rather than a
promise.  B  is  incorrect  since  the  facts  do  not  indicate  any  unjust
enrichment,  and  since,  even  if  they  did,  unjust  enrichment  is  not,
alone,  enough  to  result  in  liability.  C  is  incorrect  since  promissory
estoppel  requires  detrimental  reliance  by  the  promisee,  and  there  is
no fact indicating detrimental reliance by the plaintiff.

64.  A  An  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract  involves  an  offer  to  exchange  a
promise  for  an  act.  Since  the  notice  offered  a  prize  to  the  student
achieving the highest Grade Point Average and did not ask students to
make  any  promise  or  agreement  that  they  would  do  so,  it  was  a
promise offered in return for an act.

B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect since the offeror has the sole
power  to  decide  whether  its  offer  can  be  accepted  by  an  act  or  a
promise. D  is  incorrect  since  once  the  student  achieved  the  highest
GPA  in  her  class,  there  was  nothing  further  for  her  to  do,  and  so  it
could  not  be  said  that  she  was  now  obligated  to  perform,  as  she
would be under a bilateral contract.

65. B A promise to pay for services received in the past is usually held not
to be supported by consideration. Here, since the plaintiff's services
were  not  given  at  the  defendant's  request,  the  promise  was
unsupported by consideration and could not be enforced as a contract.
Thus, A  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  defendant  received
the  plaintiff's  promise  to  pay  after  he  nursed  the  son  back  to  health.
Consequently,  he  could  not  have  detrimentally  relied  upon  it.  D  is
incorrect because there is no moral obligation to treat the injured for
free.

66.  B  Even  if  a  claim  is  invalid,  a  promise  to  abandon  it  may  be
consideration  for  another's  promise  of  payment  if  the  claim  could

387

have been asserted in good faith. If the plaintiff did not believe that it
was entitled to the patent rights, it could not have asserted its claim in
good faith, and its promise to abandon the claim would not have been
consideration for the defendant's promise.

If the plaintiff's claim was asserted in good faith, abandonment of the
claim  was  consideration  for  the  defendant's  promise  of  payment,
regardless of whether the employment contract was enforceable. A is
therefore incorrect. C is incorrect since it indicates that the plaintiff's
promise to abandon the claim was made in good faith, which would
make it good consideration for the defendant's promise. D is incorrect
because abandonment of an invalid claim may be consideration for a
promise to pay, so long as the person abandoning the claim believes
in good faith that it is a valid one.

67. C The term FOB requires the seller to deliver the goods on board the
carrier at the place specified, and the risk of loss does not pass to the
buyer until the seller has done so. Since this contract was “FOB the
defendant's factory,” the plaintiff's obligation was to deliver it there,
and the risk of loss did not pass until she did so.

A and B are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect for two reasons: First,
the term “public enemy” refers to a person, group, or nation waging
war against the United States, and second, because while interference
by a public enemy might relieve a seller of the obligation to deliver,
it does not pass the risk of loss to a buyer.

68. D When a promise is made with the intent that its benefit flow to a third
person, that person is an intended beneficiary of the promise. When
that benefit is intended to satisfy an obligation that the promisee owes
to the third party, the third party is an intended creditor beneficiary.
According  to  the  Restatement  2d,  a  promise  is  enforceable  by  an
intended creditor beneficiary when he or she relies upon or assents to
the arrangement. Since the beneficiary is presumed to have assented
when  notified  of  the  contract,  and  since  the  contractor  notified  the
plaintiff, the plaintiff may enforce the contractor's son's promise even
though there is no privity between them.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,
because  non-assignability  would  prevent 
from
recovering but could not be raised as a defense by that assignee, and
second,  because  obligations  under  a  construction  contract  may

the  assignee 

388

generally  be  assigned  to  any  competent  contractor.  C  is  incorrect
because  the  preexisting  obligation  that  the  contractor  owed  the
plaintiff,  and  which  the  contractor's  contract  with  his  son  was
designed to satisfy, made the plaintiff a creditor rather than a donee
beneficiary.

69. A Since a contract is a meeting of minds, a person who does not know
the  legal  consequences  of  his  or  her  act  is  incapable  of  contracting.
Where  the  incapacity  results  from  intoxication,  some  jurisdictions
require  proof  that  the  other  party  was  aware  of  the  intoxication  and
the  resulting  incapacity.  Although  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  buyer
was sufficiently aware of the seller's incapacity, the additional fact in
A is the only one listed that could help the seller's defense.

So  long  as  the  seller  knew  the  legal  consequences  of  her  act,  her
motivation  is  irrelevant.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  So  long  as  the
consideration given for a promise has value, courts, recognizing that
contracting parties may be motivated by factors other than monetary
worth,  do  not  usually  inquire  into  the  sufficiency  of  that  value.  For
this  reason,  C  is  incorrect.  Although  an  offeror  may  withdraw  an
offer at any time prior to acceptance, D is incorrect for two reasons:
First,  such  withdrawal  is  not  effective  until  communicated  to  the
offeree,  and  second,  the  facts  suggest  that  a  contract  was  formed
when  the  napkin  was  signed,  making  a  subsequent  attempt  at
revocation ineffective.

70. C Although a court may reform a contract by filling in a missing term in
accordance with the manifest intent of the parties, it may not create a
contract  where  the  writing  fails  to  indicate  that  the  parties  had  the
intent of creating one. The January 5 document leaves the price term
to  subsequent  agreement  after  determining  reasonable  value.  It  does
not  indicate  that  reasonable  value  will  be  the  price  or  set  forth  any
method  by  which  the  sale  price  is  to  be  determined.  It  is  an
“agreement to agree,” and as such, it does not manifest an intention to
be bound to any particular terms.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Specific  performance  may  be
available in an action for breach of a contract for the sale of a chattel
if  the  chattel  is  unique.  Since  a  trained,  talking  bird  is  probably
unique, D is incorrect.

71.  C  Losses  that  are  normal  but  not  inevitable  results  of  a  breach  of

389

contract (e.g., the plaintiff's claim of lost business resulting from non-
delivery  of  the  station  wagon)  are  called  “consequential  damages,”
and they may be recovered if they were foreseeable to the parties at
the  time  the  contract  was  made,  and  if  they  could  not  have  been
mitigated by the aggrieved party. If the plaintiff could have traveled to
the  customers'  premises  by  renting  a  car  or  by  using  one  of  the
company  pickup  trucks,  the  defendant  would  not  be  responsible  for
damages resulting from his failure to mitigate consequential damages
by doing so.

A is incorrect because the plaintiff had advised the salesperson that
he needed to use the station wagon for his business, making business
losses  foreseeable.  B  is  incorrect  because  impossibility  excuses
performance only if it results from factors not within the reasonable
contemplation  of  the  parties  at  the  time  the  contract  was  formed.
Here, both parties knew that the defendant was planning to order the
station wagon from the manufacturer and could have anticipated that
the  manufacturer  might  not  deliver  the  car  on  time.  D  is  incorrect
since consequential damages are available in actions for breach of a
sales contract.

72. A Even though no contract exists, a party can recover from another on a
quasi-contract (i.e., a contract implied-in-law) theory when he or she
rendered  a  service  to  the  other  with  the  reasonable  expectation  of
compensation.  Thus,  if  the  doctor  had  a  reasonable  expectation  of
payment at the time she rendered medical services to the pedestrian,
she may recover on a quasi-contract theory.

A  contract  is  implied-in-fact  when,  although  the  parties  have  not

circumstances.  Since  the  pedestrian  remained  unconscious  for  the
entire period during which the doctor rendered services, he could not
have  acted  in  a  way  that  manifested  the  intent  to  make  a  binding
contract.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  quasi-
contract  recovery  is  usually  based  on  the  value  of  the  detriment
sustained  by  the  plaintiff,  rather  than  that  of  the  benefit  received  by
the  defendant.  Where  they  exist,  “good  Samaritan”  statutes  protect
physicians  against  negligence  liability  in  connection  with  treatment
that  they  render  without  expectation  of  compensation  at  accident  or
other  emergency  scenes.  Although  “good  Samaritan”  statutes  do  not

390

extend  this  protection  to  a  physician  who  charges  for  his  or  her
services, they do not prevent him or her from doing so. D is therefore
incorrect.

73. C A contract for the lease of realty is not illegal even though the lessee
might have an illegal activity in mind when he or she enters into the
lease.

Ordinarily,  the  courts  will  not  aid  either  party  to  an  illegal  contract
unless  the  party  seeking  relief  was  not  equally  guilty  (i.e.,  in  pari
delicto)  with  the  other  party.  A  and  B  are  incorrect,  however,
because the contract to lease realty did not have an illegal purpose. D
is  incorrect  because  impossibility  excuses  performance  only  if  it  is
brought about through no fault of the breaching party.

74. A Even in equitable claims, courts judge the adequacy of consideration
as of the time the contract was made, not as of the time the contract
was  allegedly  breached.  Thus,  if  it  appeared  fair  at  the  time  of
contracting,  a  court  will  find  it  enforceable.  Here,  at  the  time  of
contracting, the plaintiff gave up her job and promised to take care of
the defendant, a job of unknown difficulty and duration. Consequently,
the defendant's promise will be enforced, and the plaintiff is entitled
to specific performance. B  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  question
here regarding the defendant's intent to gift the property. C is incorrect
because  even  though  the  house  and  farm  were  worth  more  than  the
services actually performed by the plaintiff, the contract as it stood at
the  time  of  contracting  was  not  grossly  unfair  or  inequitable.  D  is
incorrect because the issue is the agreement between the plaintiff and
the defendant, not the will.

75. A  An  offer  is  a  manifestation  of  willingness  to  be  bound  to  specified
terms  that  gives  an  offeree  the  power  to  create  a  contract  by
accepting.  Since  an  advertisement  rarely  does  this,  it  is  usually
regarded as a mere invitation for offers rather than as an offer unless
the  circumstances 
the
advertisement did so with the intent of empowering another to turn it
into a binding contract simply by accepting it. Usually, such an intent
is found only where the advertisement indicates the number of items
on sale and contains words indicating an intent to be bound. Here, the
phrase  “While  they  last”  makes  clear  that  a  reader  of  the
advertisement  does  not  have  the  power  to  turn  it  into  a  binding
contract  by  accepting  and  therefore  indicates  an  intent  not  to  be

the  party  who  published 

indicate 

that 

391

bound.

B,  C,  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the  language  used  in  the
advertisement indicates an intent not to be bound to any person who
responds.

76. D Under the pre-existing duty rule, if someone does or promises to do
something that he or she is already legally obligated to do, or if he or
she forbears or promises to forbear from doing something he or she is
not  legally  obligated  to  do,  he  or  she  has  not  incurred  a  sufficient
detriment to count as consideration. Most courts hold that where one
party  promises  another  that  he  or  she  will  do  what  he  or  she  is
already  legally  obligated  to  do  for  that  person,  the  promise  is  not  a
detriment  sufficient  for  consideration.  Specifically,  courts  want  to
discourage behavior where a party takes unfair advantage of another
party  by  threatening  failure  to  fulfill  his  or  her  obligations.  A  is
incorrect because of the pre-existing duty rule. B is incorrect because
this  is  not  a  situation  where  parties  are  renegotiating  based  on  any
change  in  conditions.  C  is  incorrect  because  while  the  captain  was
likely  under  some  sort  of  duress  when  he  agreed  to  the  higher
salaries,  the  agreement  will  not  be  enforced  because  of  the  pre-
existing duty rule, making D a better answer.

77. D A condition subsequent is an event which, by agreement of the parties,
discharges  a  duty  of  performance  that  had  already  become  absolute.
The  language  of  the  sales  agreement  makes  it  clear  that  the  seller's
promise  to  have  the  downstairs  apartment  vacated  was  to  be
performed prior to payment by the buyer. Since it could not be undone
once  it  was  performed,  there  can  be  no  condition  subsequent  to  it.
Thus, D is an inaccurate statement.

A, B, and C are accurate statements since performances that are to be
exchanged  simultaneously  are  usually  found  to  be  concurrently
conditioned on each other.

78.  A  UCC  §2-102  provides  that  “this  Article  applies  to  transactions  in
goods.”  Although  many  of  the  sections  of  Article  2  create  special
rules for transactions involving merchants, many other sections apply
to all transactions in goods, whether the parties are merchants or not.
Therefore, B  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  many  commercial
transactions (e.g., sales of realty) are not “transactions in goods” and,
therefore,  are  not  covered  by  Article  2.  D  is  incorrect  because

392

transactions in services are not covered by Article 2.

79. C A promise that is unenforceable for lack of consideration or because
it  fails  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the  Statute  of  Frauds  may
nevertheless  be  enforceable  under  the  doctrine  of  promissory
estoppel  if  the  promisee  justifiably  relied  upon  it  to  his  or  her
detriment.  If,  however,  no  express  or  implied  promise  was  made  to
the plaintiff, then promissory estoppel is not applicable. Although it is
not  certain  that  the  trier  of  fact  would  find  that  no  promise  was
implied, the argument in C is the only one listed that could possibly
support the wife's position.

A  person  who  acts  without  having  been  asked  to  and  under
circumstances  such  that  his  or  her  action  was  not  called  for  by  the
situation is sometimes referred to as an “officious intermeddler” and
is prevented from receiving compensation for his or her performance.
A is incorrect because the wife asked for help, and also because the
emergency  called  for  the  plaintiff's  action.  In  a  claim  based  on
promissory  estoppel,  the  promisee's  recovery  is  not  based  on  the
value received by the promisor, but on either the promise made by the
promisor or the detriment sustained by the promisee. Thus, the value
of  the  pilot's  life  is  not  relevant  to  the  plaintiff's  claim,  and  B  is
incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  under  the  doctrine  of  promissory
estoppel, a promise may be enforceable without consideration.

80. C An offer is a manifestation of the offeror's willingness to enter into a
contract  on  the  terms  specified.  It  is  sometimes  said  that  a
communication is an offer if an acceptance is the only thing necessary
to turn it into a binding contract. The language used by the seller —
“Are  you  still  interested?”  —  leaves  some  doubt  about  whether  the
letter  expressed  a  willingness  to  be  bound.  Some  courts  might  find
that it does; some courts might find that it does not. But if a court held
that the letter was not an offer, C is the only reason listed that would
justify that conclusion.

An acceptance is an unconditional manifestation of willingness to be
bound by the terms of an offer, and is, therefore, the last step that must
be  taken  to  form  a  contract.  The  seller  obviously  did  not  intend  his
letter to result in a contract since he asked the buyer to let him know
whether he was still interested and whether the price was acceptable.
Thus, even if the buyer's letter of March 11 was an offer — which is
doubtful  —  the  seller's  letter  of  April  17  could  not  have  been  an

393

acceptance of it. For this reason, A is incorrect. Under the UCC, the
omission  of  terms  in  what  would  otherwise  be  a  contract  implies
reasonable  terms.  Specifically,  the  omission  of  a  payment  term
implies  that  full  payment  is  to  be  made  at  the  time  and  place  of
delivery.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Similarly,  an  offer  that  fails  to
indicate how acceptance should be made implies that acceptance may
be made by any reasonable means. D is therefore incorrect.

81.  A  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration  is  something  that  is  bargained  for  and
given in exchange for the promise. Although consideration frequently
is found in some benefit conferred upon a promisor in exchange for a
promise,  it  is  generally  understood  that  a  detriment  suffered  by  the
promisee is sufficient consideration for a promise if it was bargained
for  and  given  in  exchange  for  that  promise.  Since  the  defendant
desired  for  the  plaintiff  to  be  near  him,  he  promised  to  give  her  a
franchise if she would move to the city and live near him. Whether or
not  the  defendant  gained  any  benefit  from  her  move,  the  plaintiff
suffered  the  detriment  of  moving  from  her  home  to  the  city.  This
detriment, having been bargained for in exchange for the defendant's
promise, is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of consideration.

A  promise  that  is  unsupported  by  consideration  may  be  enforceable
anyway  under  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  if  the  promisee
justifiably  relied  on  it  to  his  or  her  detriment.  B  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  defendant's  promise  was  supported  by
consideration,  and  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  applies  only
in the absence of consideration. It is sometimes argued that where a
promise  is  made  to  confer  a  benefit  on  another  person  in  return  for
some act that is of no benefit to the promisor, the promise is one for a
conditional  gift  and  is  therefore  unenforceable.  This  argument  does
not  apply,  however,  where  the  detriment  suffered  by  the  promisee
was something that the promisor wanted and was an inducement for
the promisor's promise. Since the defendant desired for the plaintiff
to live near him in the city, and since it was this desire that motivated
his promise to her, C is incorrect. Affection is not enough to support a
promise  and  cannot  serve  as  consideration  because  it  is  not
something  bargained  for  in  exchange  for  a  promise.  D  is  incorrect,
however, because the promise made by the defendant was given not
merely  out  of  affection  for  the  plaintiff  but  to  induce  the  plaintiff  to
move to the city.

394

82. D  UCC  §2-601  provides  that  if  goods  delivered  fail  in  any  respect  to
conform to the contract of sale, the buyer may reject the whole, accept
the whole, or accept any commercial units (i.e., quantities that may be
sold  commercially  without  substantially  impairing  their  value)  and
reject  the  rest.  UCC  §2-607  provides  that  acceptance  does  not  of
itself  impair  any  other  remedy  for  nonconformity.  Finally,  UCC  §2-
714  permits  a  buyer  to  recover  damages  resulting  from  the
nonconformity of accepted goods.

83.  D  If  the  circumstances  that  resulted  in  destruction  of  the  structure
excused performance by the builder, his refusal to continue was not a
breach.  Since,  however,  he  did  not  perform  as  promised,  his  only
remedy  would  be  in  quasi-contract.  If  the  circumstances  did  not
excuse  performance  by  the  builder,  his  refusal  to  continue  was  a
breach. Even a breaching builder may be entitled to a quasi-contract
remedy, however, if the owner of the premises received some benefit
as a result of his or her work. In either event, the builder's recovery
would  be  limited  to  the  value  of  the  benefit  received  by  the
landowner.  Since  this  was  a  contract  for  a  new  structure,  and  the
structure  was  completely  destroyed,  the  landowner  received  no
benefit from the builder's work. The builder is therefore not entitled
to any recovery.

A seller's damages for the buyer's breach of a contract for the sale of
goods  may  consist  of  the  difference  between  the  contract  price  and
the market value of the goods. The measure of damages expressed in
A seems to be based on this rule, but it is incorrect because it is not
an accurate statement of that rule and because this is not a contract for
the  sale  of  goods.  B  and  C  are  incorrect  because  quasi-contract
damages are measured by the benefit received by the defendant, and
the landowner received no benefit at all.

84. D A condition precedent to a contractual obligation is an event that must
occur  before  a  party  will  be  under  a  duty  to  perform.  Real  estate
brokerage  contracts  frequently  make  the  broker's  commission  due
upon producing a buyer who is “ready, willing, and able” to purchase
on the agreed terms. In the contract by which the defendant agreed to
pay a 6 percent commission to the plaintiff, however, there were two
express  conditions  precedent  to  the  defendant's  obligation  to  pay.
First, the commission was due only if the house was sold to a buyer
who made an offer during a two-month period beginning September 1.

395

Second,  the  commission  was  due  only  upon  the  closing  of  title.
Although  the  plaintiff  found  a  buyer  during  the  agreed  period,  the
house was not sold to that buyer. In addition, title did not close. Since
there  was  a  failure  of  these  conditions  precedent,  the  defendant's
obligation  to  pay  the  plaintiff's  commission  never  became  absolute,
and the plaintiff is entitled to no recovery from the defendant.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

85.  B  Under  Rest.  2d  §89(a),  a  modification  is  binding  if  it  is  “fair  and
equitable  in  view  of  circumstances  not  anticipated  by  the  parties
when  the  contract  was  made.”  Here,  the  modification  was  fair  and
equitable, voluntarily entered into, and motivated by events that were
not  anticipated  at  the  time  the  original  contract  was  created.
Specifically,  an  additional  $10,000  per  year  does  not  seem
unreasonable in the face of an “explosion” of new development. A is
incorrect  because  the  modification  is  not  necessarily  enforceable
simply because the city council agreed to it. C is incorrect because of
the  rule  regarding  modification.  D  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no
indication  in  the  facts  that  the  collector  took  unfair  advantage  of  the
city.

86. A One who will derive a benefit from a contract to which he or she is
not  a  party  is  a  third-party  beneficiary  of  that  contract.  If  the
contracting parties meant for their contract to benefit the third party,
he  or  she  is  an  intended  third-party  beneficiary.  At  some  point,  an
intended  third-party  beneficiary  may  acquire  the  right  to  enforce  the
contract  even  though  he  or  she  was  not  a  party  to  it.  Some
jurisdictions  hold  that  he  or  she  acquires  that  right  upon  learning  of
the  contract;  others  hold  that  he  or  she  acquires  that  right  upon
justifiably  and  detrimentally  relying  on  the  contract;  and  still  others
hold  that  he  or  she  acquires  the  right  either  upon  relying  or  upon
assenting  to  the  contract.  All  agree,  however,  that  justified  and
detrimental reliance by an intended third-party beneficiary gives him
or  her  the  right  to  enforce  the  contract.  If  the  plaintiff  relied  on  the
agreement between his parents by cancelling his contract to purchase
a  residence,  he  is  entitled  to  enforce  the  agreement  against  the
defendant's estate.

If the benefit to a third party was intended to fulfill an obligation that
one of the contracting parties owed him, the third party is referred to
as  a  creditor  beneficiary.  Otherwise,  the  third  party  is  a  donee

396

beneficiary.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  distinction  is  based  on  the
intentions  of  the  contracting  parties  at  the  time  the  contract  was
formed  and  because  neither  parent  owed  the  plaintiff  an  obligation
that was to be satisfied by leaving him the realty. The plaintiff was,
thus,  a  donee  beneficiary  of  the  contract  between  his  parents.  C  is
incorrect,  however,  because  a  donee  beneficiary  may  enforce  a
contract if the contracting parties intended to confer a benefit on him
or  her  (subject  to  the  above  rules  regarding  the  rights  of  intended
third-party beneficiaries). If, by its terms, an agreement is not capable
of being performed within one year, the Statute of Frauds requires a
writing.  Since  the  agreement  between  the  plaintiff's  parents  was  in
writing,  its  enforceability  does  not  depend  on  whether  it  could  be
performed within one year. D is therefore incorrect.

87.  B  All  courts  agree  that  a  plaintiff's  promise  to  waive  a  valid  claim
constitutes sufficient consideration for the defendant's promise to pay
a settlement. Additionally, most modern courts would probably hold
that the waiver of an invalid claim constitutes sufficient consideration
for  a  settlement  if  the  plaintiff,  at  the  time  of  settlement,  had  a  bona
fide subjective belief that the claim was valid, and this belief was not
unreasonable.  Here,  the  plaintiff  had  a  subjective  belief  that  the
defendant was the child's father, and it was likely reasonable, as the
defendant was willing to pay a settlement to avoid a paternity suit. A
is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  evidence  of  detrimental  reliance  on
the part of the plaintiff. C  is  incorrect  because  forbearance  to  bring
suit  can  count  as  consideration  for  a  settlement.  D  is  incorrect
because the plaintiff had a bona fide subjective belief that the claim
was valid, and her belief was not unreasonable.

88.  B  An  effective  assignment  transfers  all  the  assignor's  rights  to  the
assignee. If the specialist made an effective assignment of her rights
under  the  contract  with  the  firm,  she  can  no  longer  enforce  those
rights, and the court must find against her.

Since the contract called for payment of $5,000 within 30 days after
installation  of  the  hardware  and  did  not  require  design  of  the
software  until  several  months  later,  the  parties  could  not  have
intended  design  or  its  commencement  to  be  conditions  precedent  to
payment.  A  is  therefore  not  an  effective  argument.  C  is  incorrect
because the contract apportioned $6,000 to the value of the hardware,
making the obligation to pay (at least the initial $5,000) unrelated to

397

fulfillment  of  other  obligations  under  the  contract.  A  divisible
contract  is  one  in  which  separate  obligations  are  regarded  as
separately enforceable agreements. If this contract was divisible, then
the obligation to pay for the hardware already delivered would not be
dependent  on  any  other  obligation.  D  is  incorrect  because  this
argument would hurt, rather than help, the firm's cause.

89.  D  Ordinarily,  an  order  to  buy  goods  for  current  shipment  will  be
deemed  accepted  if  the  seller  ships  conforming  or  non-conforming
goods. However, “such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not
constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that
the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.” UCC
§2-206(1)(b).  Importantly,  when  a  seller  makes  an  accommodation
shipment,  the  shipment  is  treated  as  a  counteroffer  of  the  goods  that
have  been  shipped  as  they  are.  When  the  buyer  receives  the
nonconforming  goods,  he  or  she  can:  (1)  keep  the  nonconforming
goods, in which case there is a contract for the goods as they are, at
the  price  the  seller  has  indicated  he  or  she  will  charge  for  them;  or
(2) the buyer can reject the shipment and thus prevent a contract from
coming  into  existence  at  all.  However,  the  buyer  cannot  hold  the
seller in breach for having shipped nonconforming goods or demand
conforming goods. Under the facts here, based on the manufacturer's
notice, the manufacturer's shipment of the 50 vials was a counteroffer.
Consequently, there was never a contract for the other 950 vials, and
the distributor is not entitled to specific performance. Thus, A and B
are incorrect. C is incorrect because the issue is whether there was an
accommodation,  not  anything  regarding  the  distributor's  business
practices.

90.  C  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  unenforceable  unless  supported  by
involves  a  bargained-for
consideration.  Since  consideration 
exchange, a preexisting obligation cannot serve as consideration for a
new  promise,  since  it  was  not  given  in  exchange  for  that  promise.
Except for the $250 per month that the plaintiff was already obligated
to  pay  the  defendant,  the  plaintiff  gave  nothing  in  return  for  the
defendant's promise to deliver the tiger. Thus, the defendant's promise
was unsupported by consideration and is therefore unenforceable.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  UCC  defines  the  term
merchant in terms of the sale of goods, not services, so there can be
no merchant as to the sale of services, and second, the requirement of

398

consideration is not suspended when one of the parties to a promise
is  a  merchant.  UCC  §2-209  provides  that  an  agreement  modifying  a
contract under UCC Article 2 needs no consideration to be binding. B
is incorrect, however, because under UCC §2-102, Article 2 applies
only to transactions in goods. Since the original contract between the
defendant  and  the  plaintiff  was  for  veterinary  services,  it  does  not
come under Article 2. Therefore, UCC §2-209 does not apply to the
attempted  modification.  D  is  incorrect  because  an  agreement  to
modify  a  contract  need  not  be  in  writing  to  be  valid  unless  the
contract,  as  modified,  comes  within  the  provisions  of  the  Statute  of
Frauds. Since the Statute of Frauds requires a contract for the sale of
goods with a price of $500 or more to be in writing, and since this
agreement  —  even  as  modified  —  called  for  services  and  goods
without a price of $500 or more, it does not fall within the provisions
of the Statute of Frauds.

91. A Under UCC §2-606, acceptance occurs when the buyer fails to make
an effective rejection. Under §2-602, rejection must be made within a
reasonable  time  after  delivery  and  is  ineffective  unless  the  buyer
seasonably  notifies  the  seller.  Since  the  retailer  was  aware  of  the
nonconformity the day the boards were delivered but failed to notify
the  wholesaler  of  the  nonconformity  until  the  wholesaler  sued  him
four  months  later,  he  accepted  the  boards.  Ordinarily,  a  buyer  who
accepts  the  nonconforming  goods  may  claim  damages  as  a  setoff
against the contract price. Under UCC §2-607, however, a buyer who
accepts delivery of nonconforming goods and fails to notify the seller
within  a  reasonable  time  after  discovering  the  nonconformity  is
barred from any remedy.

B  is  incorrect  because  a  buyer  who  notifies  the  seller  within  a
reasonable  time  may  revoke  his  or  her  acceptance  or  may  use
damages resulting from nonconformity of the goods as a setoff against
the  contract  price.  Although  the  boards  did  not  conform  to  the
contract  of  sale,  C  is  incorrect  because  the  retailer  failed  to
seasonably notify the wholesaler of the nonconformity. D is incorrect
because it has no basis in existing law. Even if the seller could have
avoided the nonconformity by making a reasonable inspection, he or
she  is  entitled  to  collect  the  contract  price  of  goods  that  the  buyer
accepts without notifying him or her of the nonconformity.

92. D Consideration usually consists of some legal detriment suffered by the

399

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

promisee that is given in exchange for the promisor's promise. Since
the manufacturer gave nothing in return for the engine maker's promise
to  keep  the  offer  open,  her  promise  was  not  supported  by
consideration.

Under  UCC  §2-205,  an  assurance  given  by  a  merchant  in  a  signed
writing that an offer regarding the sale of goods will be held open is
called a “firm offer,” and may be enforced without consideration. A
is incorrect, however, because although such an offer may be binding
without consideration, it is not supported by consideration unless the
offeree suffers some detriment in exchange for it. B is incorrect for a
similar  reason.  Sometimes  justified  and  detrimental  reliance  may
make  a  promise  enforceable  even  though  it  was  not  supported  by
consideration,  but,  although  detrimental  reliance  may  serve  as  a
substitute  for  consideration,  it  is  not  consideration.  Although  a
subsequent  purchase  by  the  manufacturer  might  constitute  legal
detriment,  it  could  not  be  consideration  for  the  engine  maker's
promise because the engine maker did not require it in exchange for
her promise. C is therefore incorrect.

93.  C  Ordinarily  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  there  was
consideration (i.e., something given in exchange for and to induce the
promise)  for  it.  Since  the  assistant's  service  had  already  been
rendered without expectation of payment, it was not given in exchange
for the promise and is not consideration for it. Some cases have held,
however,  that  a  promise  to  do  that  which  the  promisor  is  morally
obligated  to  do  should  be  enforceable.  Since  this  is  an  infrequently
applied  exception  to  the  requirement  of  consideration,  it  is  unlikely
that a court would come to this conclusion. C is the only one of the
arguments  listed,  however,  that  could  result  in  a  victory  for  the
assistant.

A  is  incorrect  because  an  otherwise  unenforceable  promise  is  not
made  enforceable  simply  because  it  is  in  writing.  Sometimes,  a
promisee's  justified  and  detrimental  reliance  makes  a  promise
enforceable,  serving  as  a  substitute  for  consideration.  Detrimental
reliance  means,  however,  that  the  promisee  changed  his  or  her
position  for  the  worse  because  he  or  she  believed  that  the  promise
would be kept. B is incorrect since there is no fact indicating that the
assistant relied on her promise by changing his position because of it,
or that he was worse off as a result. When a person confers a benefit

400

on another with a reasonable expectation of payment, an implied-in-
fact contract may result. D is incorrect, however, because there is no
fact indicating that the assistant had any expectation of payment when
he  rescued  the  defendant,  particularly  because  he  thought  the
defendant was dead when he leaped into the shaft.

94. B If, at the time a contract is formed, the parties to it are operating under
a mutual mistake, the resulting lack of mutual agreement excuses non-
performance  by  either  party.  Thus,  if  both  the  buyer  and  the  dealer
mistakenly believed that the painting was painted by the famous artist,
the buyer's non-performance would not constitute a breach.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  Statute  of  Frauds
requirement that the writing be signed by the party to be charged may
be satisfied by the buyer's check, and second, delivery by the seller
the  Statute  of  Frauds.  UCC  §2-302(1)  (and  some
satisfies 
jurisdictions  in  non-UCC  cases)  hold  that  if  a  contract  was
unconscionable  at  the  time  it  was  made,  the  court  may  refuse  to
enforce it. C is incorrect, however, because the equality of bargaining
positions in a contract between experts (such as an art dealer and an
art  collector)  prevents  a  voluntary  agreement 
from  being
unconscionable unless one of them deliberately withholds knowledge
from  the  other.  To  avoid  interfering  with  the  freedom  to  bargain,
courts  rarely  consider  the  adequacy  of  consideration,  except  in
consumer  contracts  when  equitable  relief  is  sought.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

95.  B  A  contract  that  had  an  illegal  purpose  when  it  was  made  is
unenforceable  by  either  party.  Of  course,  the  fact  that  one  of  the
parties had an illegal objective in mind when he or she entered into
an  otherwise  lawful  contract  is  not  enough  to  make  that  contract
illegal.  These  facts  indicate,  however,  that  both  parties  knew  the
illegal  purpose  for  which  the  premises  were  to  be  used,  that  the
landlord  agreed  to  equip  it  specifically  for  that  purpose,  and  that
computation  of  the  rent  was  based  on  the  tenant's  profits  from  his
unlawful  activity.  Under  the  circumstances,  the  contract  was  an
agreement  to  engage  in  an  unlawful  activity.  Even  though  the
operation  of  a  “sports  book”  subsequently  became  lawful,  the
illegality  of  the  contract  at  the  time  of  its  formation  makes  it
unenforceable.  Although  refusing  to  require  the  return  of  the  tenant's
deposit is likely to benefit the landlord, public policy considerations

401

justify  such  refusal.  When  asked  to  enforce  a  contract  with  an
unlawful purpose, the court will leave the parties as it found them.

The contract between the landlord and the tenant was not a gambling
contract since none of the obligations depended upon the outcome of
an  event  over  which  neither  had  control.  A  is  therefore  incorrect,
even though public policy does prohibit the enforcement of gambling
contracts. Sometimes the courts will come to the aid of one party to a
contract with an unlawful purpose, arguing that he or she was not in
pari delicto (i.e., equally guilty) with the other party. C is incorrect,
however,  because  the  fact  that  two  parties  were  in  pari  delicto  is
never  used  to  justify  granting  relief  to  one  of  them.  When  an
unforeseeable  change  in  circumstances  makes  a  contract  fail  of  its
essential purpose, the parties to it may be excused from performance
under  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose.  D  is  incorrect  because
the  change  in  circumstances  in  this  case  did  not  interfere  with  the
essential purpose of the contract but rather aided it.

96. C Generally, a buyer's damages for a seller's non-delivery consist of the
difference between the contract price and the market price on the day
of  delivery.  Since  the  market  price  and  the  contract  price  are
identical, the restaurant has sustained no real damage as a result of the
farmer's non-delivery of 1,000 bushels. (Although the restaurant may
be entitled to incidental  damages,  which  include  the  cost  of  finding
another  seller,  C  is  still  correct  because  of  its  emphasis  on  the
restaurant's lack of “substantial” damage.)

Ordinarily,  a  circumstance  that  prevented  a  party  from  performing
will  excuse  non-performance  only  if  its  occurrence  was  not
foreseeable  to  the  parties  at  the  time  of  contracting.  This  is  true
whether  that  circumstance  is  described  as  an  Act  of  God  or  not.
(After all, almost everything a farmer does depends on Acts of God.)
Since  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  the  April  storms  were
unforeseeable,  A  is  incorrect.  A  breach  of  contract  is  not  excused
simply because the breaching party gave notice in advance that there
would be a breach. There is a rule that one who treats an anticipatory
repudiation as an immediate breach is required to mitigate damages.
That  rule  is  inapplicable  here,  however,  because  the  restaurant  did
not  treat  the  farmer's  statement  as  an  immediate  breach,  taking  no
action  until  the  farmer's  non-delivery.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The
rights  of  contracting  parties  are  not  ordinarily  relative  to  the

402

obligations  that  they  may  owe  under  other  contracts.  Thus,  the  fact
that  the  farmer  owed  obligations  to  the  buyer  under  a  separate
contract  would  not  affect  the  obligations  that  she  owed  to  the
restaurant under her contract with it. D is therefore incorrect.

97.  B  A  unilateral  contract  is  one  in  which  only  the  offeror  promises  to
perform,  and  only  if  the  offeree  performs  a  specified  act.  Since  the
homeowner's  offer  was  to  pay  $1,000  to  the  person  who  “finds  the
thief,”  he  has  made  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract.  As  with  any
offer,  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract  does  not  become  binding
unless  it  is  accepted  before  it  is  effectively  revoked.  Since  an  offer
for  a  unilateral  contract  can  be  accepted  only  by  performing  the
required act, the bar owner could accept the homeowner's offer only
by  catching  the  thief  before  the  homeowner  effectively  revoked  the
offer. (Note: Many authorities hold that an offeror may not effectively
revoke after substantial performance by the offeree in reliance on the
offer.)

Some  jurisdictions  hold  that  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract
becomes  irrevocable  after  an  offeree  substantially  commences
performance.  The  bar  owner  did  not  commence  performance,
however,  so  his  statement  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  make  the
homeowner's  offer  irrevocable  even  in  those  jurisdictions.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  A  bilateral  contract  is  one  in  which  the  parties
exchange  promises,  each  promise  serving  as  consideration  for  the
other.  Although  the  bar  owner's  statement  might  be  construed  as  a
promise, the homeowner's offer made clear that acceptance could be
made  only  by  catching  the  thief.  For  this  reason,  the  bar  owner's
promise  (if  it  was  a  promise)  could  not  be  an  acceptance  of  the
homeowner's offer, and no bilateral contract could have been formed.
C  is  therefore  incorrect.  An  offer  is  a  manifestation  of  the  offeror's
intention  to  enter  into  a  contract  with  the  offeree  on  the  terms
specified,  which  raises  in  the  reasonable  person  an  expectation  that
nothing more than acceptance is required to create a contract. Since
the homeowner's statement expressed an intention to pay the specified
amount to any person who performed the specified task, it is an offer.
D is therefore incorrect.

98. C  A  liquidated  damages  clause  is  a  provision  in  a  contract  fixing  the
amount of damages should a breach occur. Courts enforce liquidated
damages  clauses  so  long  as  the  amount  set  is  reasonable,  the  actual

403

damages  are  difficult  to  ascertain,  and  the  contract  tailors  the
liquidated damages to the circumstances. If any of these requirements
is unfulfilled, the clause is unenforceable as a “penalty.” In that event,
the parties may collect only the actual damages that resulted from the
breach.  The  purpose  of  an  agreement  as  to  liquidated  damages  is  to
eliminate  the  problems  that  may  arise  in  establishing  or  defending
against  actual  damage  claims  in  certain  circumstances.  For  this
reason,  if  the  liquidated  damages  clause  is  enforceable,  it  provides
the only damage remedy. It does not, however, prevent the wronged
party  from  seeking  other  non-damage  relief.  Thus,  even  if  the
liquidated  damages  clause  did  not  establish  a  penalty  (i.e.,  was
enforceable),  the  builder  may  be  entitled  to  the  equitable  remedy  of
specific performance. C is therefore correct.

99.  B  The  standard  measure  of  damages  for  a  buyer's  breach  of  a  sales
contract  is  the  difference  between  the  price  that  the  buyer  agreed  to
pay and the reasonable market value or price received by the seller
upon resale in a commercially reasonable manner. Under the standard
measure  for  damages,  the  dealer  would  not  be  entitled  to  recover
from  the  first  buyer  since  it  sold  the  car  to  the  second  buyer  at  the
same price that the first buyer agreed to pay. UCC §2-708 provides,
however, that where the standard measure of damages “is inadequate
to  put  the  seller  in  as  good  a  position  as  performance  would  have
done,” the seller may recover the profit that it would have made from
full  performance  by  the  buyer.  If  the  first  buyer  had  performed  as
agreed, the dealer would have made one profit from the sale of a car
to  the  first  buyer  and  a  second  profit  from  the  sale  of  a  car  to  the
second buyer. As a result of the first buyer's breach, the dealer made
only one profit — the one derived from its sale to the second buyer.
The standard measure of damages is thus insufficient to put the dealer
in  as  good  a  position  as  if  the  first  buyer  had  performed  as  agreed.
For this reason, the dealer is entitled to the profit that it would have
made upon selling the car to the first buyer. Since its profit consists of
the difference between the wholesale price and the retail price, B is
correct.

A and C are incorrect for the reason discussed above. In addition to
being incorrect for this reason, D is incorrect because it is not based
on any of the existing rules for measuring damages, and also because
it bears no logical relationship to damages actually resulting from the
first buyer's breach.

404

100. B A contract may make the happening of a particular event a condition
precedent  to  the  performance  of  a  contractual  duty.  If  so,  the
obligation  to  perform  that  duty  does  not  become  absolute  until  the
condition  precedent  is  fulfilled.  Thus,  if  the  plaintiff's  remaining  in
law  school  was  a  condition  precedent  to  his  mother's  obligation  to
pay,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  withdrew  in  December  2012  would
relieve  his  mother  of  that  obligation.  A  condition  precedent  may  be
express (i.e.,  stated  in  words  or  a  substitute  for  words)  or  implied
(i.e.,  not  stated,  but  capable  of  being  reasonably  inferred  from  the
conduct  or  language  of  the  parties).  The  fact  that  the  plaintiff's
mother's  promise  was  not  to  be  performed  until  July  1,  2013,  might
justify  the  inference  that  the  plaintiff's  remaining  in  law  school  until
that  time  was  a  condition  precedent  to  his  mother's  obligation.
Although it is not certain that such an inference would be drawn, B is
the only argument listed that might support his mother's position.

Since it might take longer than one year to complete law school, and
since  the  plaintiff's  mother  promised  to  pay  within  one  year,  it  is
obvious  that  completion  of  law  school  could  not  have  been  a
condition  precedent  to  the  plaintiff's  mother's  obligation.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  Consideration  may  consist  of  some  legal
detriment  suffered  by  a  promisee  in  return  for  the  promisor's
obligation. A person suffers a legal detriment when he or she does or
undertakes  to  do  something  that  he  or  she  is  not  already  under  an
obligation to do. Since the plaintiff was not legally obligated to stop
drinking or to go to law school, his promises and undertakings to do
so  were  legal  detriments,  and  therefore  may  serve  as  consideration
for his mother's obligation. For this reason, C is incorrect. The Statute
of Frauds makes an oral contract unenforceable over objection if, by
its  own  terms,  it  cannot  be  performed  within  one  year.  Although  the
agreement between the plaintiff and his mother required the plaintiff
to go to law school and to stop drinking for the rest of his life, these
obligations could have been fully performed within one year since the
plaintiff could have died within that period. D is therefore incorrect.

101.  C  A  transfer  of  contract  rights  is  called  an  assignment;  a  transfer  of
contract duties is called a delegation. In general, contract duties are
delegable  so  long  as  delegation  would  not  prevent  the  obligee  from
getting  what  he  or  she  bargained  for.  Duties  that  involve  personal
services (i.e., that depend upon the obligor's special skills, training,
or expertise) are not delegable because an obligee who bargained for

405

the  obligor's  special  abilities  would  not  be  receiving  them  if  the
obligor's duties were performed by another. Whether crop-dusting is
an  activity  that  depends  on  the  unique  skills  of  the  crop-duster  (i.e.,
calls for personal services) is uncertain. But even if it is, the fact that
the defendant did not herself participate in the activity would indicate
that the plaintiff probably did not bargain for and certainly would not
have  received  her  special  skills  anyway.  Thus,  the  delegation  to  the
pilot  would  not  deprive  the  plaintiff  of  what  he  bargained  for,  and
would therefore not be a violation of the plaintiff's rights.

Although the statement contained in A is an accurate one, it would not
provide  the  defendant  with  an  effective  response  to  the  plaintiff's
claim because if a contract duty requires personal services, it is not
delegable.  If  a  contract  duty  requires  the  personal  services  of  the
obligor,  it  is  generally  understood  that  the  obligee  bargained  for  its
performance by the obligor himself or herself. B is incorrect because
such  a  duty  may  be  non-delegable  even  if  the  delegatee  possesses
skills  equal  to  or  greater  than  those  of  the  delegator.  In  general,
contract  rights  are  assignable  so  long  as  the  assignment  does  not
increase the burden of the obligor's performance. Although it requires
the obligor to pay a different person than the one he or she agreed to
pay,  an  assignment  of  the  right  to  collect  money  usually  does  not
increase  his  or  her  burden  since  it  does  not  change  the  amount  of
money that the obligor must pay. D is incorrect, however, because the
plaintiff  has  not  objected  to  the  defendant's  assignment  of  rights  but
rather to the defendant's delegation of duties.

102.  B  Ever  since  1677,  the  Statute  of  Frauds  has  required  a  promise  to
answer  for  the  debt  of  another  to  be  in  writing.  Since  the
shareholder's  promise  was  to  pay  the  debt  of  the  corporation,  it
would be unenforceable over the shareholder's objection if it was not
in writing.

Although a promise made under duress (i.e., induced by an improper
threat)  is  void,  economic  duress  rarely  justifies  avoidance  of  a
promise.  In  addition,  for  any  duress  to  make  a  promise  void,  the
duress  must  have  resulted  from  some  improper  threat  made  by  the
promisee.  Since  the  economic  distress  of  the  corporation  did  not
result  from  any  conduct  or  threat  by  the  bank,  and  since  the  bank's
refusal to lend money without a personal guarantee was not improper,
the  economic  fears  that  induced  the  shareholder's  promise  will  not

406

result  in  its  avoidance.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  promise  is
generally not enforceable unless it is supported by consideration. But
consideration  may  consist  of  either  some  benefit  conferred  upon  the
promisor or some detriment incurred by the promisee. Since the bank
lent money to the corporation in return for the shareholder's promise,
the  bank  incurred  a  detriment  that  satisfies  the  requirement  of
consideration even if the shareholder gained no benefit from it. C is
therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  a  surety  becomes  liable
immediately upon default by the principal debtor and is not entitled to
have  the  creditor  proceed  first  against  the  principal  debtor's  assets.
(Even without applying this principle, however, D can be eliminated
because  the  shareholder  promised  to  pay  if  the  corporation  did  not,
and the corporation did not.)

103. A Novation is the substitution by mutual consent of a third person for a
party  to  a  contract.  By  assigning  to  the  woman,  the  tenant  agreed  to
substitute the woman for him. It may be argued that by accepting rent
from the woman with the knowledge that the tenant had assigned to the
woman,  the  landlord  was  also  consenting  to  the  substitution  of  the
woman  for  the  tenant  as  a  party  to  the  contract.  Although  it  is  not
certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  that  conclusion,  the  argument  set
forth  in  A  is  the  only  one  that  could  possibly  be  effective  in  the
tenant's defense.

An accord is an agreement by which a new obligation is imposed on
one  of  the  parties  to  a  contract  in  place  of  one  that  the  contract
originally  created.  Satisfaction  occurs  when  the  party  on  whom  that
obligation  was  imposed  fulfills  it.  A  party  who  satisfies  the  new
obligation  imposed  upon  him  or  her  as  a  result  of  the  accord  is
discharged from the performance of the original obligation for which
the new one was substituted. Since the landlord's accepting rent from
the woman did not result in the imposition of any new obligation on
the tenant, it was not an accord. Therefore, there could have been no
satisfaction.  For  this  reason,  B  is  not  an  effective  argument  in  the
tenant's  defense.  Consent 
is
willingness  that  the  reasonable  person  would  gather  or  infer  by
observing  the  conduct  of  a  party.  Since  the  landlord  accepted  rent
directly  from  the  woman  knowing  that  the  tenant  had  assigned  the
balance of the lease to the woman, the reasonable person might gather
or  infer  that  the  landlord  was  willing  for  that  assignment  to  take
place.  It  might,  thus,  be  correct  to  conclude  that  the  landlord

is  willingness.  Implied  consent 

407

impliedly consented to the assignment. C is not an effective argument
in  the  tenant's  defense,  however,  because  after  an  assignment,  the
assignor  remains  secondarily  liable  for  performance  under  the
contract.  This  is  so  even  when  the  other  party  has  consented,
expressly  or  impliedly,  to  the  assignment.  The  word  alienation  is
sometimes  used  to  mean  the  transfer  of  an  interest  in  real  property,
and since an assignment is a transfer, a prohibition against assigning a
leasehold  interest  is  a  restraint  against  alienation.  Since  the  courts
look  with  disfavor  on  restraints  against  alienation,  they  are  strictly
construed.  D  does  not  present  an  effective  argument  in  the  tenant's
defense,  however,  for  two  reasons:  First,  restraints  on  alienation,  if
properly drawn, are enforceable, and second, the secondary liability
of an assignor as described above makes the question of whether the
assignment  was  a  valid  one  irrelevant  (i.e.,  if  the  assignment  was
invalid,  the  tenant  would  be  primarily  liable;  if  the  assignment  was
valid, the tenant would be secondarily liable).

104.  A  A  promise  is  ordinarily  not  enforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Thus,  a  promise  to  make  a  gift  is  not  usually
enforceable.  Once  a  gift  has  been  completed,  however,  the  donee's
rights do not depend on the donor's promise. Thus, although a promise
to make a gift may be unenforceable, a completed (or executed) gift
creates  an  irrevocable  right  in  the  donee.  The  completion  of  a  gift
requires an intent to create a property right coupled with delivery and
acceptance of some symbol of that right. It is clear that the defendant
intended  to  create  a  right  in  the  plaintiff.  Delivery  and  acceptance
probably  occurred  when  the  plaintiff  was  advised  of  the  publisher's
promise.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  that
conclusion, A is the only argument listed that could possibly provide
the  plaintiff  with  an  effective  response  to  the  defendant's  defense  of
no consideration.

An assignment is a transfer from assignor to assignee of the assignor's
right  to  receive  performance  under  a  contract.  Since  the  defendant's
contract with the publisher did not give the defendant the right to be
hired  by  the  publisher  as  a  book  illustrator,  the  benefit  that  the
plaintiff  received  could  not  have  been  received  by  assignment.  B  is
therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because the law of contracts does
not  recognize  any  special  rule  about  consideration  in  agreements
between husband and wife. Although D addresses consideration that
the publisher received for his promise, it is incorrect because it does

408

not  address  the  defendant's  defense  (i.e.,  that  there  was  no
consideration for the defendant's promise to the plaintiff).

105.  D  An  offer  can  ordinarily  be  accepted  at  any  time  prior  to  its
termination. An offer terminates, however, when the offeree becomes
aware  that  the  offeror  has  acted  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  the
offer. When the buyer learned that the seller had sold the painting to
someone else, the seller's offer terminated, depriving the buyer of the
power to accept it. This is true even though the buyer did not learn of
the offer's termination directly from the seller.

A is therefore incorrect. Since the buyer gave nothing in return for the
seller's promise to keep the offer open until February 2, his promise
was unsupported by consideration. Ordinarily, a promise to keep an
offer  open  for  a  specified  period  of  time  is  unenforceable  unless
supported by consideration. Under UCC §2-205, a written promise by
a merchant to hold an offer open for a specified period not to exceed
three months is a “firm offer,” enforceable without consideration. B is
incorrect, however, because there is no fact indicating that the seller
was  a  merchant.  The  standard  remedy  for  breach  of  contract  is  a
judgment for damages. Although specific performance is available in
the  case  of  a  contract  for  the  sale  of  a  unique  chattel,  the  wronged
party may still choose to seek a judgment for damages. C is therefore
incorrect.

106. D UCC §2-202 provides that a writing intended by the parties to be a
final expression of their agreement cannot be modified by evidence of
a prior or contemporaneous agreement. It further provides, however,
that  its  terms  may  be  explained  by  usage  of  trade.  UCC  §1-205
defines the term “usage of trade” as a practice or method of dealing
that  is  so  regularly  observed  in  a  trade  as  to  justify  the  expectation
that it will be observed in a particular transaction. Since the seller's
testimony would show that calling scmods “rock lurgid” is a usage of
trade, it should be admitted to explain the meaning of that term.

A is therefore incorrect. Since the law of contracts does not require
contracting  parties  to  agree  to  the  market  price,  B  is  incorrect.  A
contract  is  supposed  to  be  interpreted  according  to  the  intentions  of
the  parties.  For  this  reason,  usage  of  trade  is  admissible  because  it
tends to show what members of a particular trade intended by the use
of certain language. If one of the parties to a contract was unaware of
a particular trade usage, he or she may attempt to prove this to a court

409

or jury to convince it that the trade usage meaning was not what he or
she intended. Since the trade usage may still be evidence of what the
other  party  intended,  however,  it  should  be  admitted.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.

107. D Contracts frequently benefit persons other than the contracting parties
(i.e., third-party beneficiaries). In general, contracts can be enforced
only  by  parties  to  them.  Under  some  circumstances,  however,
intended third-party beneficiaries can enforce contracts to which they
are  not  parties.  Whether  a  third-party  beneficiary  is  an  “intended”
beneficiary  depends  in  part  on  whether  the  contract  called  for
performance to be made directly to that third party. If not, he or she is
merely  an  “incidental”  beneficiary  and  has  no  right  of  enforcement.
Although the defendant knew that the plaintiff's father intended to give
the  house  to  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant  may  argue  that  the  plaintiff
was  not  an  “intended  beneficiary”  because  the  contract  did  not
require the defendant to perform directly for the plaintiff (i.e., the lot
was the plaintiff's father's). A court might rule differently, but D is the
only argument listed that might be effective in the defendant's defense.

When performance is not designed to satisfy a preexisting obligation
to  a  third-party  beneficiary,  that  third-party  beneficiary  is  a  donee
beneficiary.  However,  when  performance  is  designed  to  satisfy  a
preexisting  obligation  to  a  third-party  beneficiary,  he  or  she  is  a
creditor  beneficiary.  Because  there  is  some  question  about  whether
the plaintiff's father owed the plaintiff any obligation as a result of his
oral promise to her, it is difficult to determine whether she is a donee
or creditor beneficiary. A and B are both incorrect, however, because
both  donee  and  creditor  beneficiaries  may  be  able  to  enforce
contracts  to  which  they  are  not  parties.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
facts indicate that the plaintiff cancelled a contract to buy a house as a
result of the plaintiff's father's promise.

108. B An offer is an expression by the offeror of willingness to enter into a
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
contract with the offeree on specified terms. A valid offer creates in
the  offeree  the  power  of  acceptance.  To  determine  whether  a
particular communication qualifies as an offer, it is thus necessary to
decide  whether  the  reasonable  person  in  the  position  of  the  offeree
would  believe  that  nothing  more  than  his  or  her  acceptance  is
required  to  form  a  contract.  Although  the  storeowner's  letter  of
January 5 used the word “offer,” it indicated that it was being made to

410

four different people. Since he had only one diamond ring for sale, it
must  have  been  obvious  to  each  of  the  people  who  received  the
storeowner's letter that someone else might purchase it first. For this
reason, none of them could reasonably have believed that his or her
acceptance  was  all  that  was  necessary  to  form  a  contract.  The
storeowner's  letter  was,  therefore,  not  an  offer  but  merely  an
invitation  to  negotiate.  At  best,  then,  the  first  buyer's  letter  was  an
offer. Since the storeowner did not accept it, no contract was formed
between the storeowner and the first buyer.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  as  explained  above,  the
storeowner's letter to the first buyer was not an offer, and second, if it
had been an offer, it could not have been revoked after the first buyer
accepted  it  by  his  letter  of  January  14.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
storeowner's letter was not an offer. Since the storeowner was under
no  obligation  to  sell  the  ring  to  the  first  buyer,  the  date  of  his
negotiation  and  agreement  with  the  second  buyer  is  irrelevant  in  the
first buyer's case. D is therefore incorrect.

109.  C  UCC  §2-609  provides  that  when  one  party  to  a  contract  has
reasonable  grounds  for  insecurity  about  the  other's  performance,  it
may  demand  assurances  and  suspend  its  own  performance  until  they
are  received.  The  section  also  provides  that  failure  to  furnish  such
assurances  is  a  repudiation  of  the  contract.  Since  UCC  §2-210
provides  that  a  delegation  of  contract  duties  is  a  reasonable  ground
for insecurity, the wholesaler's sale to the plaintiff gave the defendant
the  right  to  demand  assurances  from  the  plaintiff.  Since  the  plaintiff
failed  to  provide  assurances,  the  defendant  was  entitled  to  suspend
performance and did not breach by doing so.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  UCC  §2-210
specifically  provides  that  delegation  of  contract  duties  provides  the
other  party  with  reasonable  grounds  for  insecurity.  D  is  incorrect
because  UCC  §2-210  provides  that  (except  under  the  special
circumstances  set  forth  in  that  section)  a  party  may  perform  its
contract obligations through a delegate.

110. D When parties to a contract agree that one of the benefits of the contract
will  flow  directly  to  a  non-contracting  party,  that  person  is  an
intended  third-party  beneficiary.  If  the  agreement  was  made  for  the
purpose of satisfying an obligation that one of the contracting parties
owed  to  the  third-party  beneficiary,  he  or  she  is  a  creditor

411

beneficiary. Otherwise, he or she is a donee beneficiary. Once his or
her  rights  have  vested,  a  donee  beneficiary  can  enforce  the  contract
even though he or she was not a party to it. Some jurisdictions hold
that  a  donee  beneficiary's  rights  vest  when  he  or  she  learns  of  the
contract; others hold that his or her rights vest when he or she relies
on the contract to his or her detriment. All agree, however, that until
his  or  her  rights  vest,  the  parties  may  modify  the  contract  without
incurring any liability to the donee beneficiary. Since the daughter did
not  learn  of  the  contract  until  after  the  parties  had  modified  it  to
eliminate the benefit to her, she has no right to enforce it.

111. C A non-contracting party who will benefit from a contract between two
other  persons  is  a  third-party  beneficiary.  If  the  contracting  parties
intended that the benefit flow to him or her when they contracted, he
or  she  is  an  intended  beneficiary.  If  they  did  not,  he  or  she  is  an
incidental  beneficiary.  Although  an  intended  beneficiary  may  be
entitled,  under  certain  circumstances,  to  enforce  the  contract,  an
incidental  beneficiary  is  not.  In  determining  whether  a  third  party  is
an  intended  beneficiary,  courts  usually  consider  whether  a  statement
to  that  effect  was  made  during  negotiations  or  in  the  contract,  and
whether performance or payment is to flow directly to the beneficiary.
Since the contract between the landowner and the defendant called for
the  construction  of  a  house  on  property  that  belonged  to  the
landowner, and since there was no mention made of any contract right
flowing  to  the  daughter,  the  daughter  is  probably  an  incidental
beneficiary  and  not  entitled  to  enforce  the  contract  against  the
defendant.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Although  a  contract  calling  for  personal
services  is  not  ordinarily  assignable,  B  is  incorrect  because  the
landowner  has  made  no  attempt  to  assign  to  his  daughter  his  rights
under  the  contract  with  the  defendant.  A  donee  beneficiary  is  an
intended third-party beneficiary to whom neither party was under an
obligation at the time the contract between them was formed. Even if
the  daughter  were  a  donee  beneficiary,  however,  D  would  be
incorrect because a donee beneficiary may have rights to enforce the
contract.

112.  A  Ordinarily,  no  promise  is  enforceable  without  consideration.
Consideration  consists  of  some  legal  detriment  suffered  by  the
promisee  in  return  for  the  promise.  Since  the  plaintiff  suffered  no

412

legal detriment in return for the defendant's promise to keep the offer
open, the defendant's promise is unenforceable.

UCC  §2-205  provides  that  a  promise  to  keep  an  offer  open  for  a
specified period of time is binding without consideration if made by a
merchant, in a signed writing, and the transaction involves the sale of
goods. This kind of offer is known as a “firm offer.” The section also
provides that the maximum time for which a firm offer is binding is
three months. B, C, and D are all designed to trap examinees who are
confused about UCC §2-205. All are incorrect because UCC §2-205
applies  only  to  transactions  in  goods  and  has  no  application  to  the
sale  of  realty.  In  addition,  B  is  incorrect  because  the  section  sets  a
time  limit  of  three  months  rather  than  30  days.  D  is  also  incorrect
because  the  section  requires  only  that  the  offeror  be  a  merchant  and
fixes no such requirement about the offeree.

113.  A  An  assignment  transfers  the  assignor's  rights  to  the  assignee  and
extinguishes  those  rights  in  the  assignor.  Thus,  if  the  plaintiff  has
made a valid assignment of his rights to another person, the plaintiff
no  longer  has  those  rights  and  cannot  enforce  them  against  the
defendant.

A non-contracting party who will benefit from the contract is a third-
party  beneficiary.  If  the  contracting  parties  intended  him  or  her  to
benefit, he or she is an intended third-party beneficiary; if not, he or
she is an incidental beneficiary. If they intended him or her to benefit
to satisfy an obligation that one of the contracting parties owed him or
her,  he  or  she  is  a  creditor  beneficiary;  if  not,  he  or  she  is  a  donee
beneficiary.  Since  the  agreement  between  the  landscaper  and  the
defendant  specified  that  part  of  the  price  was  to  be  paid  directly  to
the plaintiff, the contracting parties clearly intended that the plaintiff
benefit  from  the  contract.  For  this  reason,  he  was  an  intended
beneficiary.  Since  they  did  so  to  satisfy  a  debt  that  the  landscaper
owed the plaintiff, the plaintiff is a creditor beneficiary. B and D are
incorrect  because  a  creditor  beneficiary  may  enforce  the  contract
even though he or she is not a party to it. C is incorrect because the
plaintiff is an intended rather an incidental beneficiary.

114. B Ordinarily, the damages remedy is designed to put the parties in the
position  in  which  they  would  have  been  had  the  contract  not  been
breached.  If  the  builder  had  not  breached  the  contract, 
the
to  his
manufacturer  would  have  a  building 

that  conformed 

413

specifications  at  a  price  of  $250,000.  To  make  the  manufacturer
whole, then, the builder should be required to pay the cost of making
the building conform to the specifications.

Although the building has the same value that it would have had if it
conformed  to  the  specifications,  it  is  not  the  building  that  the
manufacturer  contracted  for,  and  it  would  cost  the  manufacturer
$12,000 to make it so. Since damages should place the parties in the
position for which they bargained, A is incorrect. Since it would cost
only  $12,000  to  make  the  building  conform  to  the  bargained-for
specifications,  it  would  be  unjust  to  permit  the  manufacturer  to
receive  a  windfall  by  making  the  builder  pay  damages  based  on  the
difference  between  the  building's  value  and  the  value  that  resulted
from an increase in construction costs. C is therefore incorrect. D is
incorrect  because  the  manufacturer  has  received  some  value  and
should not be permitted to keep it without paying for it.

115. B An offer is a manifestation of present intent to be bound to specified
terms. One of the tests of whether a statement should be construed as
an  offer  is  whether  a  reasonable  person  in  the  shoes  of  a  person
receiving it would believe that only his or her expression of assent is
necessary  to  form  a  binding  contract.  Since  each  of  the  recipients
knew that there were three other recipients, each knew that his or her
own  expression  of  assent  might  not  result  in  a  contract  because  it
might not be the highest offer. Also, since the seller's letter referred to
the responses that he expected to receive as “offers,” a court would
probably  hold  that  it  was  nothing  more  than  an  invitation  for  offers.
While it is not certain that a court would come to that conclusion, B is
the only option listed that could possibly be correct.

Under UCC §2-205, a “firm offer” is a written promise by a merchant
to  hold  an  offer  to  buy  or  sell  goods  open  for  a  specified  period  of
time. Since there is no indication that the seller was a merchant, his
letter  could  not  have  been  a  firm  offer.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  An
option is an agreement to hold an offer open for a specified period of
time,  and  (except  for  the  provisions  of  UCC  §2-205)  is  not
enforceable without consideration. Since none of the recipients of the
seller's  letter  gave  anything  in  return  for  it  (i.e.,  consideration),  it
could not have been an option. C is therefore incorrect. An auction is
a  public  sale  of  property  to  the  highest  bidder  conducted  in  the
presence of all prospective buyers or their agents. The seller's letter

414

could not have been an auction because it was not a public sale and
because the bidders were not present. D is therefore incorrect.

116.  D  Since  quasi-contract  remedies  are  essentially  designed  to  prevent
unjust  enrichment,  they  are  usually  unavailable  against  a  non-
breaching defendant who has received no benefits from the plaintiff's
work.

A,  B,  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  In  addition,  A  is  incorrect
because its formula bears no reasonable relationship to the value of
either  the  benefit  received  by  the  homeowner  or  the  detriment
suffered by the first builder. C is incorrect for the additional reason
that quasi-contract recovery is based on reasonable value rather than
on the contract price.

117. C UCC §2-606 provides that unless the buyer does some act inconsistent
with the seller's ownership, acceptance of goods occurs only after the
buyer has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods and either
notifies the seller of his or her intention to keep them or fails to reject
them.  Thus,  payment  did  not  constitute  acceptance  because  it  was
made before the buyer was given a reasonable opportunity to inspect
the screws.

A, B, and D are incorrect because the UCC provides that acceptance
does not occur until after there has been a reasonable opportunity to
inspect.

118. B Under the Restatement of Contracts, Second, an offer for a unilateral
contract cannot effectively be withdrawn once the offeree has begun
performance. Since the designer began working on the design prior to
the  manufacturer's  attempt  to  withdraw  its  offer,  the  manufacturer's
offer will be held to be irrevocable.

A bilateral contract is an exchange of promises. Since the designer's
performance  was  complete  upon  his  submission  of  the  design,  no
bilateral contract was created by the submission because no promise
by  the  designer  resulted  from  it.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is
incorrect because an offer for a unilateral contract can be withdrawn
at any time prior to the offeree's commencement of performance. D is
incorrect  for  the  same  reason,  and  because,  under  the  UCC,
“unconscionability”  only  prevents  enforcement  of  a  contract  that  is
found as a matter of law to have been unconscionable at the time that
it was made.

415

119.  C  Usually,  a  promise  is  unenforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration,  which  requires  a  bargained-for  exchange.  Since  the
climber's promise was made after the hiker rendered a service with
no apparent expectation of compensation, the service was not given in
exchange  for  the  promise  and  the  promise  is  not  supported  by
consideration. For this reason, the majority of jurisdictions would not
enforce it. Although some courts might enforce a promise to fulfill a
“moral obligation,” C is the only answer that could be correct in any
jurisdiction.

“Good Samaritan” statutes, where they exist, protect from liability for
negligence those who render emergency aid at an accident scene. The
statutes  do  nothing  more.  A  is  incorrect  because  they  have  no
application  to  contract  problems.  B  is  based  on  an  inaccurate
interpretation of the facts: Since the hiker did not change her position
after  receiving  the  climber's  promise,  she  did  not  rely  on  it,
detrimentally  or  otherwise.  D  is  incorrect  because  if  something  of
value has been given in return for a promise, the promise is supported
by consideration even though the value of that consideration may be
uncertain.

120.  A  Upon  breach  of  the  sales  contract,  the  non-breaching  party  is
ordinarily  entitled  to  compensatory,  incidental,  and  consequential
damages.  A  buyer's  compensatory  damages  consist  of  the  difference
between  the  contract  price  and  either  the  fair  market  value  or  the
“cover”  price  (i.e.,  actual  cost  of  replacement,  so  long  as  it  is
reasonable). If the cover price (or fair market value) is less than the
contract price, the buyer is not entitled to compensatory damages, but
the saving is not credited to the breaching seller. Incidental damages
consist  of  the  reasonable  costs  of  repurchasing.  Consequential
damages  are  those  that  foreseeably  arise  from  the  special  needs  or
position of the buyer that result from the breach (e.g., the seller's non-
delivery  causes  the  buyer  to  go  out  of  business).  The  collector
sustained  no  consequential  losses,  and  since  the  collector's  cover
price  was  less  than  the  contract  price,  he  can  receive  no
compensatory damages. However, since the repurchase involved $20
in reasonable expenses, he is entitled to $20 as incidental damages.

B  is  incorrect  because  it  bears  no  reasonable  relation  to  the
collector's loss. C is incorrect because it would award the collector
the  entire  contract  price  in  addition  to  incidental  damages.  D  is

416

incorrect  because  it  would  credit  the  dealer  with  the  savings  that
resulted from his breach.

121.  B  A  donee  third-party  beneficiary  of  a  contract  may  enforce  it.  The
parties are free to modify that contract, however, any time prior to the
donee beneficiary's detrimental reliance on it. Since the daughter did
not  learn  of  the  contract  until  after  it  had  been  modified,  she  has  no
right to enforce the terms that existed prior to the modification.

A  is  incorrect  because  a  third-party  beneficiary  of  a  contract  may
enforce  it  even  though  he  or  she  has  not  given  consideration.  C  is
incorrect because the rights of a donee beneficiary do not vest until he
or she learns of or relies upon the contract, and the daughter did not
learn about or rely on the contract until after it had been modified to
exclude  her.  An  assignment  of  contract  rights  is  ineffective  until  the
assignee learns of and accepts it. D is incorrect because even if the
written  contract  between  the  homeowner  and  the  builder  was  an
assignment  to  the  daughter,  the  daughter  did  not  learn  of  her  father's
intent to create  rights  in  her  until  after  he  eliminated  those  rights  by
modifying his contract with the homeowner.

122. B In an FOB contract, the risk of loss passes to the buyer as soon as the
goods are loaded on a carrier at the place specified. This means that
once  the  air  conditioners  were  loaded  onto  the  trucking  company's
truck,  any  loss  not  resulting  from  the  fault  of  the  seller  became  the
university's. The university is thus not entitled to damages due to non-
delivery resulting from such loss.

A  is  incorrect  because  assignment  does  not  free  the  assignor  from
obligations under the contract, even if the obligee has consented to the
assignment.  As  between  parties  to  a  contract,  one  of  them  always
bears the risk of loss. The fact that a third (i.e., non-contracting) party
may also have become liable for such loss does not affect the rights
that  contracting  parties  have  against  each  other.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.  After  a  contract  is  formed,  if  a  change  in  circumstances
occurs  that  was  not  contemplated  by  the  parties  at  the  time  of
formation  and  which  makes  a  party's  performance  impossible,  that
performance  is  excused.  D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the
destruction  of  a  particular  shipment  of  air  conditioners  does  not
necessarily make it impossible for the seller to deliver other units that
would satisfy its obligation under the contract.

417

123. C Since the seller's offer was for the sale of any or all of the comics, the
dealer  could  accept  by  promising  to  purchase  any  or  all  of  them.
Since  her  telegram  specifically  agreed  to  the  purchase  of  only  one
comic, the seller may successfully argue that she rejected the seller's
offer to sell the others.

A is incorrect for several reasons. Specific performance is available
as a buyer's remedy when the subject of the contract of sale is unique
because  no  amount  of  money  can  replace  it.  The  fact  that  the  dealer
was a comic book dealer does not establish that she was buying the
comics for resale. Even if she was, damages might not be an adequate
remedy since the uniqueness of each comic (they were the only copies
in  existence)  makes  it  impossible  to  determine  what  her  damages
were. B is incorrect because the seller and the dealer are merchants,
and  under  the  UCC,  a  promise  between  merchants  to  keep  an  offer
open for a specified period of time may be enforceable even without
consideration.  Since  the  language  of  the  seller's  letter  made  it  clear
that the dealer could create a binding contract for the sale of any or
all  of  the  comic  books  simply  by  e-mailing  her  order,  the  seller's
letter was an offer, and D is incorrect.

124. D Since the shop owner's order constituted an offer, and the shipment by
the  importer  constituted  an  acceptance  of  that  offer,  the  terms  of  the
offer became the terms of the contract on July 30. The shop owner is
thus entitled to the discount for which she contracted.

If  there  is  a  discrepancy  between  printed  words  in  a  contract  form
and  typed  words  on  that  form,  the  typed  words  are  presumed  to
control.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Although  the  importer's  catalog
made clear his unwillingness to apply a 10 percent discount to any but
COD  shipments,  the  shop  owner's  offer  was  to  purchase  at  discount
with  payment  within  10  days.  When  the  importer  accepted  by
shipping,  his  pre-offer  unwillingness  became  irrelevant.  B  is
therefore incorrect. An open account is an arrangement between seller
and  buyer  whereby  the  buyer  regularly  purchases  on  credit  without
executing  notes  or  security  agreements.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
existence  of  an  open  account,  while  relevant  to  credit  terms,  is  not
relevant to price terms in a contract.

125.  D  When  a  builder  commits  an  anticipatory  repudiation  of  a  building
contract, the person who hired him or her may be entitled to rescind
and  be  free  of  all  obligations  under  the  contract.  A  is  incorrect,

418

however,  because  the  builder  is  then  entitled  to  an  offset  based  on
quasi-contract (i.e.,  the  reasonable  value  of  his  or  her  services)  for
work  already  performed.  If  the  landowner  rescinds,  the  builder's
quasi-contract  remedy  might  exceed  the  amount  that  he  has  received
from  the  landowner.  If  so,  the  builder  is  entitled  to  credit  for  the
excess as a setoff in the landowner's action for the cost of completion.
On the other hand, if the landowner does not rescind but instead sues
the  builder  for  the  standard  remedy,  he  is  entitled  to  the  difference
between  the  contract  price  and  the  cost  of  completion.  Since  the
landowner still holds $50,000 of the contract price, this sum should
be deducted from the standard remedy. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  For
the same reasons as A and B, C is incorrect.

126.  C  Under  UCC  §2-511,  a  contract  that  is  silent  as  to  the  manner  of
payment  calls  for  payment  in  any  manner  current  in  the  ordinary
course of business. The seller is entitled to demand payment in cash,
but  if  he  or  she  does  so,  the  buyer  is  entitled  to  a  reasonable
opportunity to procure the necessary cash.

A is incorrect for the reason stated above. B is incorrect because the
buyer is entitled to a reasonable time to procure cash. D is incorrect
because a seller may demand cash.

127.  D  Under  UCC  §2-209(1),  an  agreement  to  modify  a  contract  is
enforceable  even  though  unsupported  by  consideration.  Since,  as
modified,  the  agreement  does  not  fall  within  the  provisions  of  the
Statute  of  Frauds,  it  need  not  be  in  writing.  Thus,  if  the  committee
agreed  to  accept  475  bobbleheads  instead  of  500,  the  company's
delivery of 475 bobbleheads would not be a breach.

The company's inability to obtain the necessary materials would not
excuse performance unless that inability resulted from circumstances
that were not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the
time the contract was formed. Since there is no indication that this is
so, A is incorrect. A buyer who accepts a nonconforming tender may
recover damages only if it notifies the seller of its intention to sue. B
is  incorrect,  however,  because  no  notice  is  required  if  the  buyer
rejects  the  tender.  Since  the  contract  called  for  delivery  of  500
bobbleheads, tender of any fewer is a breach in spite of the fact that
the  committee  may  not  have  actually  needed  500.  C  is  incorrect  for
this reason (and incidentally, because there is no indication that it was
to  each
the  committee's  plan 

to  give  only  one  bobblehead 

419

conventioneer).

128. C The brokerage contract made transfer of title a condition precedent to
the  homeowner's  obligation  to  pay  the  broker.  Since  title  was  not
transferred,  the  condition  had  not  been  met,  and  the  homeowner's
obligation to pay the commission never came into being.

A is not a good defense because the homeowner voluntarily accepted
the  $98,000  offer,  thus  waiving  the  price  condition  that  appeared  in
the  brokerage  contract.  Since  the  contract  for  sale  between  the
homeowner and the buyer was formed on August 1, within the period
of the broker's exclusive right to sell, B is not a good defense. Since
the  contract  between  the  broker  and  the  homeowner  granted  the
broker  the  exclusive  right  to  sell  the  homeowner's  home,  the  broker
would  be  entitled  to  a  commission  upon  the  transfer  of  title,  even
though  the  sale  was  made  without  the  broker's  participation.  D  is
therefore not a good defense.

129.  B  Under  the  Statute  of  Frauds,  a  promise  that  by  its  terms  cannot  be
performed  within  a  year  must  be  in  writing.  Since  the  mother's
promise to buy books for a two-year period could not be performed
within a year, it violated the Statute of Frauds.

Even  if  the  offer  made  by  the  mother  was  divisible,  the  plaintiff's
successful  completion  of  her  first  year  of  law  school  would  have
been  an  acceptance  of  both  its  parts.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is
incorrect because there is no special rule governing a promise to pay
a  cash  bonus;  such  a  promise  is  enforceable  according  to  the  rules
that  govern  the  enforceability  of  promises  in  general.  Since  the
mother's  offer  to  pay  for  the  plaintiff's  books  was  an  offer  for  a
unilateral  contract  (a  promise  for  an  act),  the  plaintiff's  successful
completion of her first year was both an acceptance of the offer and
consideration for her mother's promise. D is therefore incorrect.

130.  B  Before  the  obligor  learns  of  an  assignment  by  the  obligee,  if  an
obligor and obligee agree in a commercially reasonable manner to a
valid modification of the contract, the modification is effective as to
rights  that  the  assignee  has  acquired  against  the  obligor.  Thus,  the
plaintiff  is  bound  by  the  modification.  An  obligor's  duty  under  a
contract  is  discharged  to  the  extent  of  payment  made  to  the  obligee
before learning of the obligee's assignment. Thus, the company should
receive  credit  for  any  payment  that  the  company  made  to  the  man

420

prior to notification of the assignment. Since the company's payment
of  $50,000  to  the  man  completely  discharged  the  company's
obligation under the contract as modified, and since the modification
and  payment  took  place  prior  to  notice  of  the  assignment  to  the
plaintiff, the plaintiff's claim will fail.

131.  D  Ordinarily,  no  promise  is  enforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration  consists  of  some  legal  detriment
sustained by the promisee in return for the promisor's promise. Since
at the time the sister promised her brother that she would let him live
on the farm, she was already obligated to do so, her promise to him
was not a legal detriment to her and thus could not be consideration
for his promise to share their aunt's estate with her. For this reason, D
is correct.

Even without consideration, a promise many be enforceable under the
doctrine of promissory estoppel if the promisee justifiably relied on it
to his or her detriment. A is incorrect, however, because there is no
indication that the sister relied on her brother's promise to share the
estate. B is incorrect because the brother's promise was unsupported
by  consideration.  Since  the  brother  was  unaware  of  his  sister's
promise  to  their  mother,  it  could  not  constitute  an  implied  condition
precedent to the brother's obligation. C is therefore incorrect.

132. D The assignee of contract rights is entitled to enforce them to the same

extent the assignor would have been.

The defendant's breach of his contract with the homeowner gives the
plaintiff,  as  the  homeowner's  assignee,  a  cause  of  action  against  the
defendant.  A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Contract  rights  are
ordinarily  alienable,  as  are  other  chattels.  Since  any  chattel  or  right
may  be  the  subject  of  a  gift,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  gave  no
consideration for the assignment of the homeowner's rights would not
prevent it from taking effect. C is therefore incorrect.

133. A An insurance contract involves an agreement by the insurer to pay the
insured  upon  the  occurrence  of  an  event  not  within  the  control  of
either.  The  payment  agreed  upon  need  not  bear  any  relationship  to
damage  that  results  from  the  event  (although  many  policies  require
that there be such a relationship). Since the insurance company agreed
to pay $50 per day in the event of destruction or substantial damage to
the house by fire, it is obligated to do so.

421

B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  insurance  company's  agreement  to  pay
$50 per day is not a liquidated damages clause since it does not fix
liability  in  the  event  of  breach  by  the  insurance  company.  C  is
incorrect because it attempts to apply to an insurance contract the rule
that  determines  the  validity  of  a  liquidated  damages  clause.  The
insurance  policy  fixes  the  insurance  company's  liability  for  the
homeowner's  living  expenses  at  $50  per  day  without  regard  to
whether or not she actually incurred such expenses. D is incorrect for
this reason.

134. A An anticipatory breach occurs when, before performance is required,
a party to a contract says or does something that indicates that he or
she will not perform as required. When an anticipatory breach occurs,
the other party need not wait until the time for performance is passed
but may immediately avail itself of remedies for breach of contract.

Since  the  sculptor's  obligation  under  the  contract  was  to  submit  a
statue  for  approval  by  the  mayor,  her  failure  to  do  so  is  a  breach
whether or not the statue would have met with the mayor's approval
when  submitted.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  a
breach  occurs  when  a  party  fails  to  fulfill  his  or  her  contractual
obligations, whether or not he or she profits from such failure. Since a
contract  calling  for  a  party's  personal  satisfaction  is  understood  to
require  good  faith,  that  party's  promise  to  pay  if  satisfied  is  not
illusory. D is therefore incorrect.

135. C  Ordinarily,  non-delivery  by  the  seller  entitles  the  buyer  to  damages
consisting of the difference between the contract price and either the
“cover  price”  or  the  reasonable  market  value  of  the  undelivered
goods.  Here,  because  the  eggs  delivered  did  not  conform  to  the
agreement,  the  bar  owner  was  entitled  to  return  them.  Since  he  has
already  paid  the  contract  price  and  has  received  nothing  for  his
money,  he  is  entitled  to  the  return  of  what  he  paid  in  addition  to
damages.

Specific performance, as suggested by A, is available only where the
subject  of  the  sales  contract  is  unique  or  cannot  otherwise  be
obtained.  Here,  there  are  no  facts  to  suggest  that  this  is  so.  B  is
incorrect because it is the measure of damages for breach of warranty
and is obviously insufficient to compensate the bar owner, since the
small eggs have been returned but paid for. D is incorrect because it
does  not  permit  recovery  for  damages  resulting  from  the  farmer's

422

breach.

136. D The buyer's offer was for a unilateral contract. According to its terms,
it could be accepted only by performance consisting of delivery of the
books  to  the  buyer's  home.  An  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract  can  be
withdrawn  at  any  time  prior  to  the  offeree's  performance  or
commencement of performance.

A  is  incorrect  because  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract  binds  only
one party (the promisor) until accepted by performance. B and C are
incorrect because an offer for a unilateral contract cannot be accepted
by any means other than performance.

137. C A liquidated damages clause is enforceable (and does not constitute a
penalty)  if  the  amount  specified  is  reasonable  in  light  of  what  the
parties contemplated at the time the contract was formed, if the actual
damages would be difficult to ascertain, and if the liquidated damages
agreed  to  are  tailored  to  the  circumstances  of  the  contract.  Since
living expenses would be difficult to ascertain, and since the clause
calling for liquidated damages was tailored to the contract, the clause
is  enforceable  if  $75  per  day  was  reasonable  in  light  of  what  the
parties contemplated at the time the contract was made.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  if  the  liquidated  damages  clause  is
enforceable,  the  buyer  need  not  show  that  he  actually  sustained  or
could not have avoided or mitigated the damage. D is incorrect since
a liquidated damages clause does not constitute a penalty just because
one of the parties hoped that it would encourage the other to perform
on time.

138.  B  Although 

the  administrator's  forbearance  might  have  been
consideration  for  the  husband's  promise  to  pay,  the  question
specifically  asks  whether  the  doctor's  services  are  sufficient
consideration. Consideration involves a bargained-for exchange, and
since the husband did not ask the doctor for the services, they cannot
be  said  to  have  been  “bargained  for.”  (Note:  Although  some  cases
allow recovery on another theory for services like those rendered by
the doctor to the extent necessary to prevent injustice, such services
are not “consideration” unless bargained for.)

The services rendered may have imposed a moral obligation upon the
husband, but A is incorrect because it is generally understood that a
moral  obligation  is  not  sufficient  consideration  for  a  promise.  C  is

423

incorrect  because  even  a  material  benefit  is  insufficient  to  serve  as
consideration  unless  it  was  bargained  for.  D  is  incorrect  for  two
reasons:  First,  courts  do  not  generally  inquire  into  the  adequacy  of
that  which  was  given  as  consideration,  and  second,  since  there  was
no  bargain,  it  does  not  matter  whether  the  services  rendered  were
adequate.

139. D Although an offer can ordinarily be withdrawn by the offeror at any
time prior to its acceptance, the Restatement rule is that an offer for a
unilateral contract cannot be withdrawn once the offeree has begun to
perform. Thus, if the student began making extra efforts in an attempt
to  win  the  prize,  the  company  was  prevented  from  withdrawing  the
offer.

A and B are therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because an offer for a
unilateral contract can be accepted only by performance, making the
student's letter irrelevant.

140. A If a contract is made with the intention of benefiting a third party to
whom neither of the contracting parties owes any obligation, that third
party is referred to as an intended donee beneficiary of the contract.
Since  the  landowner's  intention  was  to  give  a  wedding  gift  to  his
daughter and the contractor's son, the contractor's son is an intended
donee  beneficiary.  In  some  jurisdictions,  a  donee  beneficiary  may
enforce only a promise on which he or she has detrimentally relied. In
others,  he  or  she  may  enforce  it  if  he  or  she  has  assented  to  it.  The
Restatement view is that he or she may enforce it if he or she relied
or assented. But if, as here, he or she has done neither, he or she has
no right to enforce the agreement.

A  condition  precedent  is  an  event  that  must  occur  before  a  party's
obligation to perform becomes absolute. Ordinarily, it results from an
express  or  implied  agreement  between  the  parties.  Since  the
contractor's  son's  agreement  to  paint  the  house  was  made  after  the
landowner's agreement to convey, the contractor's son's performance
could  not  have  been  intended  to  be  a  condition  to  the  landowner's
obligation. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because when the
landowner  entered  into  the  January  1  contract  with  the  contractor,  it
was for the purpose of giving a wedding gift to the contractor's son as
well  as  his  daughter.  D  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the
agreement between the landowner and the contractor probably did not
create  any  fiduciary  relationship  between  them,  and  second,  the

424

contractor's agreement with the builder was not inconsistent with any
right or benefit to which the landowner was entitled.

141. A Specific performance of a sales contract will be granted where money
damages  that  would  accurately  compensate  cannot  be  measured
because the subject of the sale is rare or unique. Since the guitar was
a rare one, specific performance might be available. Although it is not
certain  that  a  court  would  decide  to  grant  such  relief,  A  is  the  only
remedy listed that could possibly be granted.

If  a  court  awarded  damages,  they  would  be  based  on  the  difference
between the contract price and the fair market value of the guitar. B is
incorrect  because  it  does  not  accurately  measure  the  damages.  C  is
incorrect  because,  while  the  buyer  may  elect  damages  or  specific
performance, she may not receive both. D is incorrect since there is
no relationship between $500 and the damages sustained by the buyer.

142. A By its terms, the UCC applies to all transactions in “goods,” which
are defined as any things that are movable at the time of the sale.

The UCC provides approaches for filling in certain missing terms, but
the absence or presence of any particular terms in a contract does not
determine whether the UCC applies. B is therefore incorrect. C and D
are incorrect since nothing in the UCC definition of “goods” excludes
living  creatures  or  consumer  items  (i.e.,  items  purchased  for  the
buyer's own use).

143. A Although the attorney's refusal to accept the painting is excused by her
reinvestment  of  the  money  in  reliance  on  of  the  defendant's
prospective inability to perform, her refusal of the defendant's tender
discharges the defendant from further obligation to perform.

B  is  incorrect  since  the  defendant's  obligation  to  deliver  is  not
dependent on the attorney's reason for making the purchase. C and D
are incorrect since the attorney's refusal to accept delivery constitutes
a waiver of any specific performance rights that she otherwise might
have had.

144.  B  When  a  contract  calls  for  performance  by  one  party  prior  to
performance  by  the  other,  the  first  party's  performance  is  generally
held to be a condition precedent to the other party's performance. A
condition  precedent  is  an  event  without  which  a  party's  obligation
does not become absolute. Since the contract provided that the buyer's

425

obligation  was  void  if  the  downstairs  apartment  was  not  vacant
within  three  months  after  the  transfer  of  title,  vacancy  of  the
downstairs  apartment  was  an  express  condition  precedent  to  the
buyer's  obligation  to  pay  the  additional  $2,000.  An  obligor's
obligation is discharged upon failure of a condition precedent to it.

A is incorrect since the seller is no longer the owner of the premises
and therefore lacks standing to bring a proceeding to evict the tenant.
C  is  incorrect  because  the  contract  specifies  that  in  the  event  the
apartment  remained  occupied,  the  buyer's  remedy  is  to  avoid  his
obligation  to  pay  the  additional  $2,000.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
contract  specifically  provides  that  the  buyer's  obligation  to  pay  the
additional $2,000 is nonexistent if the apartment is not vacant within
three months after the passage of title.

145. A A contract is formed upon acceptance of an offer. Thus, if the seller's
letter of April 17 was an offer, a contract was formed if the buyer's
acceptance was effective before the offer was revoked. Ordinarily, an
acceptance  is  effective  upon  dispatch  if  communicated  in  a  manner
authorized by the offer. Since an offer that does not specify a means of
communicating  acceptance  authorizes  acceptance  in  any  reasonable
manner, a contract was formed on April 21 when the buyer dispatched
the  e-mail  since  sending  an  e-mail  was  a  reasonable  way  of
communicating acceptance.

Good  faith  means  honesty  and  fair  dealing.  B  is  incorrect  because
there is no indication that the seller failed to act in good faith. C  is
incorrect  because  an  offer  not  specifying  a  means  of  acceptance
authorizes  acceptance  in  any  reasonable  manner.  Revocation  of  an
offer  is  effective  when  notice  is  received  by  the  offeror.  Since  the
seller did not notify the buyer of his change of mind, it could not have
effected a revocation. Thus, D is incorrect.

146. D An obligor is discharged of liability to the obligee's assignee to the
extent of any payments made to the original obligee prior to notice of
the assignment. Thus, if the firm paid $15,000 to the specialist before
being  advised  that  the  specialist  had  assigned  her  rights  to  the
programmer,  it  could  not  be  required  to  pay  that  sum  to  the
programmer.

Since the $15,000 in question was payment for work that had already
been delivered, the fact that the programmer might not be capable of

426

carrying  out  the  obligations  under  the  contract  is  not  relevant  to  her
right to collect. A is therefore incorrect. In general, all rights under a
contract are assignable, so a contract that is silent about the right to
assign  impliedly  permits  assignment.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  A
modification of a contract occurs when the parties agree to change the
performance required. An assignment is a transfer of contract rights.
Since assignment of a right does not change the performance required,
the  right  asserted  by  the  programmer  was  not  the  result  of  a
modification. C is therefore incorrect.

147. D Under UCC §2-209, an agreement to modify a contract for the sale of
goods needs no consideration to be binding. Since a contract for the
sale of an aardvark is a contract for the sale of goods, the agreement
that the defendant made to “throw in a pig” for the plaintiff's daughter
is binding and may be enforced by the plaintiff.

A, B, and C are incorrect because the provisions of UCC §2-209 do
not  distinguish  contracts  between  merchants  from  contracts  between
non-merchants.

148.  B  A  buyer  who  rightfully  rejects  nonconforming  goods  is  entitled  to
damages for non-delivery. Under UCC §2-713(1), these consist of the
difference between the contract price and the market price at the time
when the buyer learned of the breach. Since the retailer learned of the
nonconformity on January 15, B is correct.

C is therefore incorrect. A would be the correct measure of damage if
the  retailer  had  kept  the  7-foot  boards  but  is  incorrect  because  he
returned  them  to  the  wholesaler.  Rejection  of  nonconforming  goods
may be made within a reasonable time after receiving them. Although
the 
the
nonconformity,  the  return  of  the  goods  two  days  later  was  probably
within a reasonable time. Even if two days was not a reasonable time,
however,  the  wholesaler's  agreement  to  their  return  would  prevent
him from making that assertion. D is therefore incorrect.

immediately  upon  discovering 

retailer  did  not  act 

149. C  Although  an  assignment  does  not  imply  a  warranty  that  the  obligor
will perform, an assignment for consideration does imply a warranty
that at the time of the assignment, the obligor has no defenses. Since at
the time of the pawnbroker's assignment to the retailer, the buyer had
a  defense  based  on  the  nonconformity  of  the  ring  delivered  by  the
pawnbroker,  the  pawnbroker's  implied  warranty  to  the  retailer  was

427

breached. The pawnbroker is therefore liable to the retailer.

A and B are incorrect because there has been a breach of the implied
warranty that the obligor has no defenses. D is incorrect because no
warranty  that  the  obligor  will  perform  is  implied  by  an  assignment,
even for consideration.

150. D A party's promise is illusory if that party's promise has not created a
binding  obligation.  If  each  party  has  not  agreed  to  a  binding
obligation, the agreement is not enforceable. Under the agreement, the
butcher  agreed  to  provide  meat  at  $10  per  pound,  but  the  restaurant
didn't  actually  promise  to  do  anything.  The  restaurant  could  order
meat from another supplier or not order any meat at all since it only
agreed  to  order  as  much  meat  as  “the  restaurant  decides  to  order.”
Consequently, the agreement is not enforceable.

A is incorrect because the restaurant hasn't actually done anything to
suggest it detrimentally relied on the butcher's promise. The restaurant
only said that it needed top quality steaks for a “planned” convention.
It didn't say it decided to host the convention based on the agreement,
or  that  it  was  actually  going  to  have  the  convention  at  all.  B  is
incorrect  because  the  restaurant  did  not  bind  itself  to  buying  meat
from  the  butcher.  Under  a  valid  requirements  contract,  a  promisor
agrees  to  buy  from  a  supplier  all  that  he  or  she  requires,  and  the
supplier agrees to supply that amount. If the restaurant had agreed to
buy as much “top quality” steaks as it required, it would have been a
the  UCC.  Impossibility  of
valid  requirements  contract  under 
that  was
performance  excuses  performance  when  an  event 
unforeseeable  at  the  time  of  formation  occurs  prior  to  the  time  of
performance,  making  performance 
incorrect
because,  although  it  would  be  costly  for  the  butcher  to  provide  the
steaks, it would not be impossible.

impossible.  C 

is 

151. D When an unforeseeable change in circumstances makes a contract fail
of  its  essential  purpose,  the  parties  to  it  may  be  excused  from
performance  under  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose.  The
essential purpose of the contract between the landlord and the tenant
was the operation of a “sports book.” Since an unforeseeable change
in  state  law  made  that  activity  illegal,  the  contract  has  failed  of  the
essential  purpose  contemplated  by  both  parties  at  the  time  it  was
formed.  The  tenant  is,  thus,  excused  from  performance  under  the
doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose.  Since  his  non-performance  is,

428

therefore, not a breach, he is entitled to the return of his deposit.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  agreement  between  the  landlord  and  the
tenant  was  not  a  gambling  contract.  B  is  incorrect  because  the
subsequent  and  unforeseeable  illegality  of  the  contract's  purpose
makes  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose  applicable.  “In  pari
delicto”  means  “equally  guilty.”  C  is  incorrect,  because  at  the  time
the contract was formed, neither party was guilty.

152. B An anticipatory repudiation occurs when a promisor makes a positive
statement  to  the  promisee  that  he  or  she  will  not  perform  his  or  her
contractual duties. An anticipatory repudiation by a promisor may be
treated as an immediate breach by the promisee. One who repudiates
before the time for performance may withdraw his or her repudiation
unless the other party relied upon it. Since the restaurant relied on the
farmer's repudiation by making other arrangements for the purchase of
1,000  bushels,  the  farmer  is  prevented  from  withdrawing  her
repudiation, and the restaurant is relieved of its obligation to her with
respect to 1,000 bushels.

Novation is the substitution by mutual consent of a third party for one
of  the  original  parties  to  contract.  Since  there  has  been  no  such
substitution, A is incorrect. Nudum pactum is a phrase that refers to a
promise that is not supported by consideration. Since the promises of
the farmer and the restaurant were each given in return for the other, C
is incorrect. Impossibility of performance excuses performance when
an event that was unforeseeable at the time of formation occurs prior
to the time of performance, making performance impossible. Its effect
is to relieve both parties of their obligations under the contract. The
doctrine 
inapplicable  here  because  performance  was  not
impossible  for  either  the  farmer  or  the  restaurant.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

is 

153.  C  The  Statute  of  Frauds  applies  to  land  sales,  so  any  land  sale
agreement  has  to  be  in  writing.  However,  under  Rest.  2d.  §148,  so
long  as  a  contract  does  not  involve  a  sale  of  goods,  it  can  be
rescinded  orally  even  if  the  original  agreement  was  in  writing.
Consequently,  even  though  the  original  contract  had  to  be  in  writing
(since  it  involved  land),  the  agreement  was  validly  rescinded  when
the  developer  orally  said  it  was  fine  if  the  farmer  wanted  out.  A  is
therefore incorrect.

429

B and D are incorrect. While the farmer seems to have lied when he
stated he was “talking about selling,” there's no indication he actually
did  anything  regarding  the  resale  of  the  property  or  that  those
statements  caused  the  developer  to  do  anything.  Consequently,  his
statements wouldn't change the analysis.

154.  A  Under  UCC  §2-201(2),  “between  merchants  if  within  a  reasonable
time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the
sender  is  received  and  the  party  receiving  it  has  reason  to  know  its
contents, it satisfies the requirements [of the Statute of Frauds] against
such  party  unless  written  notice  of  objection  to  its  contents  is  given
within  10  days  after  it  is  received.”  Under  UCC  §2-201(1),  a
confirmation letter is sufficient against the sender if it is “sufficient to
indicate  that  a  contract  for  sale  has  been  made  between  the  parties
and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.” Here,
since both parties appear to be merchants, the confirmation letter was
sufficient to bind the sporting goods store when it did not send written
objection  within  10  days  of  receipt.  Importantly,  the  store  read  the
letter and the only thing the store has done is phone the distributor. C
is therefore incorrect.

B is incorrect because the issue here concerns the oral nature of the
original agreement and its apparent violation of the Statute of Frauds,
not any potential failure of consideration. D is incorrect because the
store  did  not  send  written  notice  of  objection  within  10  days.  The
store merely called the distributor 11 days after it received the letter.

155. C Although an assignment of contract rights divests the assignor of those
rights, a delegation of contract duties does not have the same effect,
even  when  consented  to  by  the  obligee.  For  this  reason,  the  woman
will remain liable to the banker for any breach of their contract. On
the other hand, a delegatee of contract duties also becomes liable to
the  obligor  for  breach  since  the  obligor  is  an  intended  third-party
creditor beneficiary 
of the contract of delegation. For this reason, the bank may be entitled
to collect from either the woman or the trucker.

A and B are therefore incorrect. The standard measure of damage for
breach of contract is the difference between the contract price and the
reasonable market value of the services contracted for. In the event of
a major breach, however, the wronged party may elect the remedy of
rescission  and  restitution.  Rescission  involves  cancellation  of  the

430

contract.  Restitution  requires  the  return  to  the  wronged  party  of  any
unearned benefit that he or she conferred on the breaching party. Since
the trucker's refusal to perform is obviously a major breach, the bank
may  seek  rescission  and  restitution.  D  is  therefore  incorrect  for  this
reason,  and  because  it  fails  to  account  for  the  fact  that  the  bank  has
paid the woman.

156. A Contracts frequently benefit persons other than the contracting parties.
Such  persons  are  called  third-party  beneficiaries.  If  the  contracting
parties meant for those persons to benefit from the contract, they are
intended beneficiaries; otherwise, they are incidental beneficiaries. If
a  promisor's  performance  is  intended  to  satisfy  a  preexisting
obligation owed by the promisor to the third-party beneficiary, he or
she is a creditor beneficiary; if not, he or she is a donee beneficiary.
Once  an  intended  third-party  beneficiary's  rights  have  vested,  the
contracting parties are no longer free to modify or rescind the portion
of their contract that benefits him or her. Since the president and the
publisher intended that the artist benefit from the publisher's promise
to employ her, and since this was not intended to satisfy a preexisting
obligation that the president owed the artist, the artist is an intended
donee  beneficiary.  In  some  jurisdictions,  the  rights  of  a  donee
beneficiary vest as soon as he or she learns of the contract. In other
jurisdictions, his or her rights vest only when he or she detrimentally
relies  on  the  contract.  In  other  jurisdictions,  his  or  her  rights  vest
when  he  or  she  detrimentally  relies  or  expresses  assent.  Since  the
artist learned of the contract, assented to it, and detrimentally relied
on it by notifying other clients that she could not work for them, her
rights  have  vested  in  all  jurisdictions,  and  she  may  succeed  in  her
claim against the publisher.

B is incorrect for two reasons; First, consideration for the publisher's
promise was furnished by the president's giving him a low rate, and
second,  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  makes  the  artist's
detrimental  reliance  a  substitute  for  consideration.  The  Statute  of
Frauds requires a promise that cannot be performed within a year to
be in writing. C is incorrect because the publisher's promise was to
employ the artist for one year and was therefore not required to be in
writing.  D  is  incorrect  because  after  the  donee  beneficiary's  rights
have vested, the contracting parties may not rescind without his or her
consent.

431

157. B  In  attempting  to  enforce  the  father's  promise,  the  soldier  faces  two
problems. First, the Statute of Frauds requires a writing for a promise
to convey an interest in real estate, and the father's promise was oral.
Second,  a  promise  is  not  ordinarily  enforceable  if  made  without
consideration,  and  the  soldier  gave  nothing  in  return  for  her  father's
promise.  The  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  might  solve  both
problems,  making  the  soldier's  detrimental  reliance  on  the  father's
promise a substitute for both a writing and consideration. To be more
precise,  the  soldier's  reliance  might  cause  her  father  to  be  estopped
from raising either the lack of a writing or the lack of consideration as
a defense. Since the soldier's cancellation of the contract that she had
already made could subject her to liability and will cause her to lose
the  benefits  of  her  previous  bargain,  it  could  qualify  as  detrimental
reliance.  In  any  event,  B  is  the  only  argument  listed  that  could
possibly support the soldier's claim.

that 

The  argument  in  A  is  not  that  modification  violated  the  soldier's
rights,  but 
the  modification  was  unenforceable  without
consideration. It is generally understood, however, that the parties to
a  fully  executory  bilateral  contract  may  agree  to  rescind,  the
necessary consideration being furnished by each party's giving up the
right  to  the  other's  performance.  The  parties  are  then  free  to  make  a
new  contract  by  exchanging  new  promises.  Thus,  the  absence  of
consideration  would  not  invalidate  the  new  agreement  between  the
father and the builder. A is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect for two
reasons: First, the writing did not contain any promise to the soldier,
and second, even if the Statute of Frauds is satisfied, the problem of
consideration for the father's promise to the soldier remains unsolved.
Consideration  is  something  given  in  return  for  a  promise.  Since  the
soldier had married and decided to retire from the military before her
father's promise was made, her marriage and retirement could not be
consideration for his promise. D is therefore incorrect.

158. C Although the usual remedy for breach of a sales contract is a judgment
for  damages,  specific  performance  is  available  to  a  buyer  if  the
subject  of  the  contract  was  unique  or  highly  unusual.  This  is  nearly
always true of contracts for the sale of realty, because every piece of
realty  is  regarded  as  unique.  Though  not  as  common  in  the  sale  of
chattels, specific performance may be granted in the event of a breach
by one who has agreed to sell a highly unusual chattel.

432

A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect because the award of specific
performance  does  not  depend  on  whether  or  not  the  parties  to  the
sales  contract  are  merchants.  Since  a  seller  can  usually  resell  a
chattel upon the buyer's breach and recover as damages the difference
between the contract price and the resale price, specific performance
is not usually available to a seller. D is incorrect for this reason.

159. A Ordinarily, a party to a contract may assign its rights or delegate its
duties  to  another.  UCC  §2-210  provides,  however,  that  delegation
does  not  relieve  the  delegator  of  contract  duties  or  of  liability  for
breach.  Since  the  wholesaler  delegated  its  duties  to  the  new  owner,
and since the new owner breached those duties by failing to provide
assurances as required, the wholesaler (as well as the new owner) is
liable to the plaintiff for the breach.

An agreement to substitute the performance of a third person for that
of  the  obligor  accompanied  by  a  specific  agreement  to  release  the
obligor from its contractual duties is a “novation,” which relieves the
released  obligor  of  any  further  obligation.  The  plaintiff's  consent  to
the  wholesaler's  assignment/delegation  would  not  have  that  effect,
however,  because  the  plaintiff  did  not  specifically  agree  to  release
the  wholesaler.  B  and  C  are  incorrect  for  this  reason.  C  is  also
incorrect  because  UCC  §2-210  provides  that  a  party  who  demands
assurances  from  a  delegatee  does  not  thereby  prejudice  its  rights
against the original obligor. Although an assignment of rights implies
a delegation of duties, D is incorrect because the assignor/delegator
is secondarily liable upon breach by the delegatee.

160. A  An  accord  is  an  agreement  to  substitute  a  lesser  obligation  for  that
which existed under a contract. Like any other agreement, it does not
ordinarily  have  binding  effect  (i.e.,  does  not  discharge  the  original
contract obligation) unless supported by consideration. Consideration
usually  consists  of  some  legal  detriment  suffered  in  return  for  the
benefit  received.  The  benefit  received  by  the  homeowner  was  a
reduction in the price of the paint job. If the homeowner did not give
anything  in  return  (i.e.,  consideration)  for  this  reduction,  the
contractor  would  be  entitled  to  collect  the  balance  due.  If  the
homeowner did not reasonably believe that the contractor's work was
not  “satisfactory,”  he  was  not  entitled  to  seek  damages  under  the
contract  and  gave  up  nothing  in  return  for  the  reduction  in  price.
However, if he did reasonably believe that the contractor's work was

433

not “satisfactory,” he had a right to seek damages under the contract.
Here,  the  numerous  drips  and  missed  spots  likely  made  his  belief
reasonable. By giving up this right, he has given consideration for the
reduction in price. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

161. A  If  a  buyer  accepts  defective  goods,  that  buyer  generally  can  sue  for
breach  of  warranty.  Here,  by  taking  the  cups  and  reselling  them,  the
home  design  store  accepted  the  goods.  Under  §2-714(2),  the  usual
damages  for  breach  of  warranty  are  the  “difference  at  the  time  and
place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the
value  they  would  have  had  if  they  had  been  as  warranted,  unless
special  circumstances  show  proximate  damages  of  a  different
amount.”  Consequently,  the  home  design  store  is  entitled  to  the
difference in value at the time of the shipment, or 50 cents times 1,000
($500). Although the drop in the stock market caused the home design
store to lose even more money when it resold the cups, this does not
affect the damage calculation. B and C are therefore incorrect. D  is
incorrect  because  the  manufacturer  sent  defective  goods,  and  the
buyer of defective goods is entitled to recover under the UCC.

162. C If the manufacturer had not breached his contract, the builder would
have  collected  $250,000,  from  which  he  would  have  had  to  pay  the
costs of completing the building. Since the damages remedy should be
designed  to  place  the  parties  in  the  positions  for  which  they
bargained, the builder should receive the contract price less the cost
of completing the building.

A is incorrect because the builder did not bargain for and should not
receive the benefit of a windfall resulting from increased construction
costs. B is incorrect because it fails to take into account the expenses
that  the  builder  would  have  had  in  earning  the  contract  price.  A
builder who commits a substantial breach may have no remedy other
than quasi-contract for the detriment that he or she has suffered. Since
the  builder  has  not  committed  a  breach,  however,  he  should  not  be
restricted to this remedy. D is therefore incorrect.

163. A An offer is a manifestation of present intent to be bound to specified
terms.  Since  the  seller's  letter  expresses  an  unequivocal  intention  to
sell the accordion to the second buyer for $2,000, it is an offer.

C is therefore incorrect. An acceptance is an agreement to be bound
to the terms of an offer. The seller's letter could not be an acceptance

434

unless the second buyer's letter was an offer. Since Baker's letter did
not  actually  say  that  he  would  pay  $2,000  (i.e.,  did  not  express  a
willingness  to  be  bound),  but  rather  asked  whether  the  seller  would
accept $2,000, it was not an offer, and the seller's response could not
have  been  an  acceptance.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Since  the  seller
never agreed to sell the accordion to the first buyer,  his  offer  to  the
second buyer could not be a repudiation of an agreement with the first
buyer. D is therefore incorrect.

164.  A  Under  UCC  §2-313,  a  warranty  is  made  by  any  description  of  the
goods that is given by the seller and which is part of the basis of the
bargain. The seller thus warranted that the beams delivered would be
steel. Under UCC §2-714, a buyer who has accepted nonconforming
goods  and  who  notifies  the  seller  of  the  nonconformity  within  a
reasonable time is entitled to damages. The measure of damages for
breach of warranty is fixed by UCC §2-714 as the difference between
the value that the delivered goods had at the time of acceptance and
the value that conforming goods would have had at that time.

B  is  incorrect  because  it  would  entitle  the  buyer  to  keep  the  beams
without  paying  anything  for  them.  C  is  incorrect  because  it  would
allow  the  seller  to  collect  the  price  of  steel  beams  although  he
delivered iron beams. Although the seller might have been better off
selling  the  beams  to  another  buyer  at  a  price  higher  than  they  were
worth, he has breached his warranty that the beams delivered would
be  steel  and  will  be  required  to  compensate  the  buyer  for  what  the
buyer has lost. D is therefore incorrect.

165.  A  Since  the  buyer  contracted  to  purchase  the  homeowner's  home,  his
failure  to  do  so  is  a  breach  that  entitles  the  homeowner  to  any
damages that result. A is therefore correct.

A  buyer  can  frequently  obtain  specific  performance  of  a  contract  to
sell  realty  because  the  uniqueness  of  a  given  parcel  of  realty  makes
money  damages  an  inadequate  remedy.  B  is  incorrect,  however,
because there is nothing unique about the money that the homeowner
was  to  receive  under  the  contract,  making  money  damages  an
adequate remedy for the seller. Consequently, C is incorrect as well.
Impossibility excuses performance only if the circumstance that made
performance  impossible  was  unforeseeable  at  the  time  the  contract
was formed. The subsequent illness of a party is usually regarded as
foreseeable, making D incorrect.

435

166.  D  An  assignment  is  a  transfer  of  a  right  to  receive  the  benefits  of  a
contract. If there was an enforceable agreement between the nephew
and the landowner, the nephew's promise to share some of the rights
that  he  received  under  that  contract  could  be  called  an  assignment.
Although  it  is  not  certain  that  the  nephew's  conversation  with  his
sister resulted in a valid assignment, A is the only answer that could
possibly be correct.

The difference between an assignee and a third-party beneficiary of a
contract is that an assignee's right is transferred to him or her after a
contract  has  been  created,  while  a  third-party  beneficiary's  right
(whether  an  intended  or  an  incidental  beneficiary)  is  created  by  the
contract  itself.  Since  the  agreement  between  the  nephew  and  the
landowner did not require either the nephew or the landowner to give
anything  to,  or  do  anything  for,  the  sister,  the  sister's  right  was  not
created by it. A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

167.  A  Although  a  contract  is  not  usually  enforceable  except  by  one  in
privity,  a  third-party  beneficiary  may  enforce  it  if  the  parties  to  the
contract intended that it should benefit him or her. This is true whether
the  intended  third-party  beneficiary  is  a  creditor  beneficiary  or  a
donee  beneficiary.  A  creditor  beneficiary  is  one  whom  the  parties
intended to benefit to satisfy a preexisting obligation owed by one of
them.  The  neighbor  is  a  creditor  beneficiary  since  the  homeowner
made the contract to satisfy an obligation that he owed the neighbor.

A  donee  beneficiary  is  one  whom  a  contracting  party  intended  to
benefit  even  though  he  or  she  owed  him  or  her  no  obligation.  B  is
incorrect  since  the  homeowner  owed  the  man  an  obligation  under
their  previous  agreement.  An  incidental  beneficiary  is  one  who
derives  benefit  from  a  contract  not  made  with  the  intention  of
benefiting  him  or  her.  Thus,  C  is  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  since  the
man  was  an  intended  beneficiary  of  the  lawn  service  and  the
homeowner's contract.

168.  A  An  offer  is  an  expression  of  willingness  to  be  bound  to  specified
terms. Since both parties were aware of the price and terms set forth
in  the  buyer's  letter,  the  seller's  statement  could  be  construed  as  an
offer to sell the books to the buyer under those same terms.

B and C are incorrect because the buyer's letter of July 8 bound him
to purchase only if the books were delivered to his home, so nothing

436

but delivery could be regarded as acceptance. D is incorrect because
the performance required is delivery of the books, and the seller has,
by his statement, made no efforts toward such delivery.

169. C A condition is an event that must occur before the performance of a
contractual obligation is due. Because the builder could not build the
pool  until  the  homeowner  identified  where  it  should  be  built,  the
homeowner's failure to indicate the correct address could be seen as
a failure of the condition. Until necessary conditions are fulfilled, an
obligor is entitled to suspend performance. If it is too late to fulfill the
condition, the obligation is discharged. Here, since the contract called
for the pool to be completed before the homeowner returned home, it
was too late for the homeowner to fulfill the condition by identifying
the correct address and the builder's obligation was discharged.

The  standard  measure  of  damages  for  breach  of  a  contract  for
services  is  the  difference  between  the  contract  price  and  the  market
price.  Since  the  standard  price  was  10  percent  higher  than  the
contract  price,  the  homeowner  could  still  recover  the  difference
between the market price and the contract price. This is true whether
another  builder  was  willing  to  build  the  pool  for  the  same  price  or
not.  Consequently,  A  is  incorrect.  The  law  of  contracts  does  not
guarantee  a  profit.  B  is  incorrect  because  if  the  builder's  obligation
was  otherwise  enforceable,  the  fact  he  would  lose  money  does  not
relieve him of his obligation. D is incorrect because the fact he could
not  collect  payment  from  the  neighbor  is  irrelevant  to  the  contract
between the builder and the homeowner.

170.  C  The  standard  measure  for  damages  for  a  builder's  breach  of  a
construction contract is the difference between the contract price and
the owner's actual cost of completing the building as agreed. Here, the
original agreement was $200,000 for construction to be completed by
December 1. The second builder agreed to complete the building by
December 1 for $250,000. Consequently, the damages caused by the
breach of the contract were $50,000. Although the storeowner agreed
to pay an extra $25,000 if the work was completed sooner, this would
not be part of the standard calculation for damages. Consequently, B
and D are incorrect.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  the  project  ended  up  costing
$275,000 (which was the amount the first builder said he could do the
job for), this fact does not excuse the initial breach of contract.

437

171. D  The  standard  measure  for  damages  for  breach  of  a  sales  contract  is
the difference between the contract price and the fair market value on
the date performance was required.

It  is  generally  understood  that  a  non-breaching  party  has  a  duty  to
mitigate damages after a breach. This means that he or she cannot sit
by  and  watch  those  damages  increase  when  reasonable  conduct
would  have  prevented  damages  from  increasing.  Here,  the  seller's
failure  to  attempt  to  resell  the  building  has  done  nothing  to  increase
the damages he has suffered due to the breach of contract. Thus, A is
incorrect.  Although  unforeseeable 
that  make
performance  of  contractual  duties 
impossible  may  excuse
performance of a contract, the failure of the company's funding did not
make  the  purchase  of  the  office  building  impossible  (maybe
inconvenient or foolhardy, but not impossible). Thus, B is incorrect.
C  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  the  entrepreneur  informed  the  seller
prior to the date set for closing did not excuse the breach.

circumstances 

172.  A  UCC  §2-209  provides  that  the  modification  of  a  sales  contract  is
valid,  even  without  consideration.  The  engine  maker's  agreement  to
accept  $200  as  payment  in  full  is,  therefore,  enforceable  as  a
modification of the original contract.

B is incorrect because a modification need not be in writing unless,
as modified, the contract comes under the Statute of Frauds. Since the
modification  set  a  purchase  price  of  $200  (i.e.,  less  than  $500),  the
fact  that  it  was  not  written  does  not  affect  its  enforceability.  C  is
incorrect  because  UCC  §2-209  specifically  dispenses  with  the  need
for consideration. Duress is a compulsion or constraint that deprives
a party of the ability to exercise free will, and it generally involves
physical threats. Economic pressures do not constitute duress unless
the one exerting them brings about a desperate economic situation of
the  other  party.  Even  then,  most  jurisdictions  refuse  to  call  such
pressure duress. D is therefore incorrect.

173. C Under UCC §2-209, a modification of a contract is valid even though
unsupported by consideration. That same section provides, however,
that the Statute of Frauds applies to a contract which, as modified, is
within its provisions. Since the agreement made on April 15 between
the buyer and the farmer called for the purchase of 1,000 bushels at
the American Pear Exchange price as of May 1, and since that price
was  $2  per  bushel,  the  contract  called  for  the  sale  of  goods  with  a

438

price  of  $2,000.  Since  the  Statute  of  Frauds  applies  to  the  sale  of
goods  with  a  price  of  $500  or  more,  this  oral  contract  as  modified
falls  within  its  provisions,  and  is  therefore  unenforceable  over  the
objection of the buyer.

Although farmers are generally free to negotiate prices for the sale of
pears, the farmer is bound by the price that she already negotiated. A
is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  no
consideration is required for the modification of a contract under the
UCC, so the fact that each promise was consideration for the other is
irrelevant, and second, the Statute of Frauds requires this contract to
be in writing, whether it is supported by consideration or not. Since
liability  for  breach  of  contract  is  imposed  regardless  of  fault,  a
party's liability is not dependent on his or her ability to perform. D is
therefore incorrect.

174. C Under modern law, forbearance to assert a claim against another party
is consideration for the other party's promise to pay money if the party
who forbears reasonably believes his or her claim to be valid. Thus,
if the bar owner reasonably believed his claim for unpaid bar bills to
be valid (whether or not the student believed this), his forbearance to
assert that claim is valid consideration for the promise to pay that the
student made in his letter of September 3. Under these circumstances,
that promise would be enforceable.

A  unilateral  contract  is  one  in  which  a  party  exchanges  his  or  her
promise for the other party's act. An offer for a unilateral contract can
be accepted only by performing the act for which the offeror called.
Since the student's letter offered to pay if the bar owner would refrain
from  suing  him  (i.e.,  to  exchange  the  student's  promise  for  the  bar
owner's act of forbearance), it was an offer for a unilateral contract.
As  such,  it  could  be  accepted  only  by  the  bar  owner's  performance
(i.e., forbearance to sue). For this reason, the bar owner's failure to
respond  to  the  student's  letter  would  not  be  relevant  to  the  issue  of
whether  or  not  the  student's  offer  was  accepted.  A  is  therefore
incorrect. If the bar owner did not reasonably believe that the student
owed  him  $10,000,  he  suffered  no  legal  detriment  by  forbearing  to
assert a claim for that sum. His forbearance could not, therefore, be
consideration for the student's promise. The student's promise would
thus be unenforceable, and B is therefore incorrect. The bar owner's
claim is not based on the promise the student made when he incurred

439

the alleged bar bills, but on the promise that the student made in the
letter of September 3. If that promise is enforceable, it is independent
of  the  original  claim  for  unpaid  bar  bills.  For  this  reason,  the
enforceability  of  the  claim  for  unpaid  bar  bills  is  not  relevant.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

175. C In general, contract obligations are freely delegable unless the obligee
has a special interest in having the obligations performed personally
by  the  obligor.  It  is  usually  held  that  construction  contracts  are
delegable,  since  any  reputable  builder  can  construct  whatever  was
contracted  for  if  provided  with  the  proper  plans.  Since  a  moat  is
simply a hole in the ground, and since the earthmoving subcontractor
completed  the  moat  in  complete  conformity  with  the  landscaper's
plans, the landscaper's delegation of the digging work was probably
not a breach of contract.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  homeowner's
interest in having the job done by a well-known architect is probably
satisfied  by  the  fact  that  the  landscaper  designed  the  plan  and
executed most of the work himself, coupled with the fact that the moat
was  dug  in  complete  conformity  with  the  landscaper's  plan.  D  is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  contract  rights  are  not  freely
assignable  if  the  assignment  would  impose  an  additional  burden  on
the  assignor's  obligor,  and  second,  a 
transfer  of  contractual
obligations is a delegation, not an assignment.

176.  C  Since  the  doctor  did  not,  by  word  or  deed,  express  or  imply  a
willingness  to  pay  for  the  maintenance  of  the  neighbor's  lawn,  he  is
under no obligation to do so. (Note: It is generally understood that an
assignment  of  contract  rights  includes  a  delegation  of  contract
obligations.  Since  the  homeowner  assigned  to  the  doctor  his  rights
under the contract between the homeowner and the lawn service, the
lawn service would have been entitled to enforce against the doctor
any  rights  that  the  lawn  service  had  under  that  contract.  Since  the
homeowner  did  not  assign  to  the  doctor  any  rights  under  the
homeowner's  contract  with  the  neighbor  and  did  not  delegate  to  the
doctor any obligations under his contract with the neighbor, however,
the neighbor may not enforce those rights against the doctor.)

A  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  that  the  neighbor  has
suffered any detriment as a result of reliance on the payments made by
the doctor to the lawn service. A covenant contained in the record of

440

title  to  realty  may  be  enforceable  against  subsequent  owners  of  the
realty  if  it  touches  and  concerns  the  land  involved.  B  is  incorrect,
however, because there is no indication that the homeowner's promise
was noted in the record of title to his realty. As has been noted above,
the  doctor  is  not  liable  to  the  neighbor  because  the  doctor  made  no
express  or  implied  promise  that  would  be  enforceable  by  the
neighbor. Although D correctly concludes that the doctor is not liable
to  the  neighbor,  it  suggests  that  the  reason  is  that  the  neighbor
sustained  no  damage.  This  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the
neighbor  is  now  paying  $25  per  month,  while  previously  he  was
paying nothing.

177. A An anticipatory repudiation is an unequivocal statement that he or she
will not perform made by a party before performance is due under a
contract. Upon a party's anticipatory repudiation, the other party has
an immediate right to sue for breach of contract. In general, all duties
under  a  contract  are  delegable  except  those  that  call  for  personal
services  or  special  skills.  Since  the  design  of  the  software  program
required special skills and knowledge, the specialist lacked the right
to delegate that duty to the dealer, and the specialist continued to be
under an obligation to perform. Her statement on August 16 was, thus,
an  anticipatory  repudiation,  giving  the  firm  an  immediate  right  of
action against her.

B is incorrect because an assignment of all rights under a contract is
generally understood to delegate all duties under that contract. Since
anticipatory  repudiation  results  in  an  immediate  right  of  action,  the
fact that performance is not yet due does not prevent a suit for breach
on  that  ground.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
duty  to  design  a  program  involved  personal  services  and  special
skills, so even though it was delegated by the specialist's sale to the
dealer, the delegation did not relieve the specialist of her duties under
the contract.

178. C Under UCC §2-201(1), a contract can be enforced against a party if
that party has sent the other party a memorandum. To be enforceable,
the  memorandum  has  to  be  a  “writing  sufficient  to  indicate  that  a
contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the
party  against  whom  enforcement  is  sought  .  .  .  A  writing  is  not
insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon
but  the  contract  is  not  enforceable  under  this  paragraph  beyond  the

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

441

quantity of goods shown in the writing.” Nearly all courts have held
the absence of a price term does not make a memorandum insufficient.
Here, the music store's “confirmation” letter is sufficiently complete
to serve as a memorandum. However, since the letter says “5 guitars,”
the  factory  can  only  enforce  the  agreement  to  this  amount.  Thus,  the
factory is entitled to the profit it would make on selling five guitars,
or $250. Importantly, the facts state that the factory can make all of the
guitars  ordered  by  its  customers,  so  it  is  not  losing  anything  except
profits on this failed sale.

A, B, and D are, therefore, incorrect.

179. A In an assignment, the assignor transfers to an assignee the assignor's
right  to  receive  a  benefit  from  a  third  person.  Here,  the  company
promised  to  give  the  school  a  guitar,  and  the  school  transferred  its
right  to  receive  it  to  the  plaintiff  when  the  plaintiff  submitted  the
highest bid. Importantly, the company made a promise to the school to
donate  the  guitar.  That  promise  was  supported  in  one  of  two  ways.
Either  there  was  consideration  because  the  guitar  company  would
receive free publicity by donating the guitar, or there was detrimental
reliance because the school “sold” the guitar. Consequently, because
the school can enforce the guitar company's promise, the plaintiff can
also enforce the promise as the school's assignee.

B is incorrect because an intended third-party creditor beneficiary of
a contract is a third party to whom one of the contracting parties owed
a  preexisting  debt  and  to  whom  the  other  party  therefore  agreed  to
render  performance.  Here,  there  is  no  indication  the  school  owed  a
debt to anyone. C  is  incorrect  because  although  there  was  no  direct
agreement between the guitar company and the plaintiff, the plaintiff
can enforce the guitar company's promise to the school as an assignee.
D  is  incorrect  because  the  promise  was  likely  supported  by
consideration, as stated above.

180.  D  Under  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose,  a  party  may  be
discharged  from  a  contract  if  the  party's  purpose  is  completely  or
almost completely frustrated by events that destroy the party's purpose
in  entering  the  contract.  The  television  station  could  broadcast  the
advertisement, but since the music-streaming service's primary reason
for running the advertisement at that particular time was to reach the
musician's  audience  with  its  musician-themed  ad  and  exclusive
content, and since that purpose has been frustrated by the musician's

442

death,  the  music-streaming  service  will  be  discharged  from  the
contract. Importantly, the musician's death was an unforeseeable event
that  occurred  through  no  fault  of  the  music-streaming  service.
Consequently, B is incorrect.

A is incorrect because the understanding between the parties was that
the ad would run during the concert, and the doctrine of frustration of
purpose would still apply. C is incorrect because it is not impossible
for the ad to run, it is simply that the purpose for running the ad has
been  completely  frustrated  by  the  musician's  death  and  lack  of  the
televised concert.

CRIMINAL LAW QUESTIONS

1. The public prosecutor had information that unlawful gambling

activities were being conducted at a tavern known as the Second
Bedroom on Main Street. She obtained a warrant for the search of the
Second Bedroom by presenting an affidavit that stated that she had

445

received information regarding the illegal activities from an informant
who had observed the reported activities while present at the tavern.
The affidavit stated that the informant frequently gave information to
the police and prosecutor and that the information received from the
informant in the past had always been found to be accurate. It did not
give the name of the informant, however, because it stated that his
anonymity needed to be preserved both for his own protection and to
continue his effectiveness as an informant.

The warrant that was issued authorized the search of “the premises
known as the Second Bedroom and located at 481 Chambers Street”
and of “all persons in said premises at the time of the execution of the
warrant who are found to be in possession of gambling records.”
There was a furniture store known as the Second Bedroom located at
481 Chambers Street, but the officers assigned to execute the warrant
went to the Second Bedroom tavern on Main Street. Upon searching
the premises, they found gambling records in a cash drawer located
behind the bar.

The owner of the tavern was charged with violating the state's
gambling law. He moved to suppress the use of gambling records
found in the cash drawer. His most effective argument in support of
that motion is that

(A) the affidavit submitted in support of the application for the warrant

was based entirely on hearsay.

(B) the affidavit submitted in support of the application for the warrant

did not identify the informant.

(C) the information contained in the affidavit submitted in support of the

application for the warrant was uncorroborated.

(D) the information contained in the affidavit submitted in support of
the application for the warrant did not properly identify the
defendant's premises.

2. The defendant checked her suitcase when she made a cross-country

airplane flight. Police officers had a warrant for the defendant's arrest.
When the plane landed, a police dog that was trained to recognize the
smell of marijuana was allowed to sniff all checked baggage as part of
a routine inspection procedure. Upon sniffing the defendant's bag, the
dog gave signs that it had been trained to give when it recognized the

446

smell of marijuana. The defendant was allowed to claim the suitcase
when she got off the plane. After she claimed it, a police officer
arrested her for possession of a dangerous drug as she carried the
suitcase through the airport. The arresting officer then searched the
suitcase and found a package of marijuana.

After her conviction for drug possession, the defendant made a timely
appeal to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence against her.
The trial court had found that the arresting officer had probable cause
to believe she was in possession of marijuana. Should the motion be
granted?

(A) Yes, because allowing the dog to sniff the defendant's luggage was

an unreasonable search.

(B) No, because the arresting officer had a warrant for the defendant's

arrest.

(C) No, because the possibility of airline hijacking makes the routine

examination of passengers' luggage necessary to protect the public
against a clear and present danger.

(D) No, because when the defendant was arrested, the arresting officer
had probable cause to believe that she was in possession of
marijuana.

3. The defendant met the victim in a bar where both were drinking.

Because the defendant was too drunk to drive, the victim offered him a
ride home. In the victim's car, the defendant put his arms around the
victim and attempted to kiss her. The victim told him that she wasn't
interested and tried to push him away, but the defendant overpowered
her and succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her. The victim
was 17 years old.

The defendant was charged with forcible rape under the common law.
If only one of the following facts or interferences were true, which
would be most likely to lead to the defendant's acquittal on that
charge?

(A) The defendant was so drunk that he believed the victim was willing

to have sexual intercourse with him.

(B) The defendant was so drunk that he did not realize that he was

engaging in sexual intercourse.

447

(C) The victim was so drunk that she did not realize that the defendant

was engaging in sexual intercourse with her.

(D) The victim was so drunk that immediately after intercourse began,
she forgot who the defendant was and believed him to be her
husband.

4. In which of the following fact patterns is the defendant's motion to

suppress the evidence most likely to be granted?

(A) The defendant was riding in a car owned by his friend. Police

stopped the car and asked to see the friend's driver's license. After
the friend showed it to them, they asked his permission to search
the car. The friend said, “Sure, go ahead.” Upon searching under
the seat in which the defendant had been sitting, the police found a
package of heroin, which was offered at the defendant's trial for
illegally possessing narcotics.

(B) The defendant was staying at a hotel, but he was two weeks behind
on his room charges. The hotel desk clerk permitted the police to
search the defendant's room while he was out. Upon doing so, the
police found narcotics, and the defendant was subsequently
charged with possession.

(C) The defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated. After he
was taken to jail, his car was towed to the police auto pound.
There, a police officer taking inventory of the car's contents found a
weapon in the car that had been used in the commission of a crime
with which the defendant was subsequently charged.

(D) While the defendant was driving, police officers stopped him for

going through a red light. A routine check of his license through the
police department computer indicated that a bench warrant had
been issued for his arrest for failing to appear in connection with
four parking tickets that had been issued to vehicles registered to
him. The officers advised him that he was under arrest. Although
they did not handcuff him, they ordered him to empty his pockets
onto the hood of the police car. A marijuana cigarette that was in
one of his pockets was subsequently offered against him at his trial
for possession of a controlled substance.

5. The defendant had lost her job and needed to make some money

quickly. While visiting a local tavern, she ran into an old friend. When
the defendant told the friend about her financial problems, the friend

448

pointed to an expensive-looking coat that was hanging on a coat rack
and said, “Why don't you steal that coat? It looks like you should be
able to sell it for at least $100.” Because the defendant said that she
was afraid the owner of the coat would see her, the friend agreed to
sing in a loud voice to create a diversion so that the defendant could
steal the coat while everyone was watching the friend. As soon as the
friend began to sing, the defendant took the coat from the coat rack and
ran from the tavern. In fact, the coat actually belonged to the friend,
who had been joking when he told the defendant to steal it.

Of which of the following crimes may the defendant be properly
convicted?

(A) Larceny only.

(B) Conspiracy only.

(C) Larceny and conspiracy.

(D) Neither larceny nor conspiracy.

6. The defendant knew that his neighbor, the victim, had a weak heart and
that the victim had suffered several heart attacks in the past. Because
he was angry at the victim, the defendant decided to try to frighten him
into another heart attack. He watched the victim's house, and when he
saw the victim leaving through the front door, he ran toward him
shouting, “Look out! Look out! The sky is falling!” Although the
defendant was not sure that this would kill the victim, he hoped it
would. When the victim saw the defendant running toward him
shouting, he became frightened, had a heart attack, and died on the spot.

The jurisdiction has statutes that define first degree murder as “the
deliberate and premeditated killing of a human being,” and second
degree murder as “any unlawful killing of a human being with malice
aforethought, except for a killing that constitutes first degree murder.”
In addition, its statutes adopt common law definitions of voluntary and
involuntary manslaughter.

Which of the following is the most serious crime of which the
defendant can properly be convicted?

(A) First degree murder.

(B) Second degree murder.

449

(C) Voluntary manslaughter.

(D) Involuntary manslaughter.

7. The defendant was having dinner in a restaurant with his employer, the
victim, when the victim left the table to go to the restroom. As the
victim walked away, the defendant noticed that the victim's wristwatch
had fallen off his wrist onto the table. Since it looked like a rather
valuable watch, the defendant decided to steal it. Picking up the watch,
he put it into his pocket. A few moments later, he began to feel guilty
about stealing from his employer, so when the victim returned to the
table, the defendant handed him the watch and said, “Here, you
dropped this, and I put it into my pocket for safekeeping.”

Which is the most serious crime of which the defendant can be
properly convicted?

(A) Larceny.

(B) Attempted larceny.

(C) Embezzlement.

(D) No crime.

8. A 15-year-old girl undressed a 15-year-old boy and attempted to have
sexual intercourse with him. Although at first the boy was unwilling to
have intercourse, the girl gave him marijuana to smoke until he became
so intoxicated that he was willing to try. By then, however, his
intoxication made him physically unable to perform. A statute in the
jurisdiction provides that “A person is guilty of rape in the third degree
when, being 17 years of age or more, he or she engages in sexual
intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years.”

If the girl is charged with attempting to commit rape in the third degree
as a result of her attempt to have intercourse with the boy, she should
be found

(A) guilty, because she overcame his resistance by the use of an
intoxicating substance and would have completed the act of
intercourse but for the boy's physical inability to perform.

(B) guilty, because the boy was under the legal age of consent.

(C) not guilty, because the girl was under the age of 17.

450

(D) not guilty, because the girl was a female.

9. A store owner wanted to erect a new storage building so that he could
expand his business of selling animal food and veterinary supplies. He
was afraid, however, that the building department would not issue him
a permit to begin construction. A building department clerk said that
she would make a false entry in the official records to indicate that a
permit had already been issued if the store owner would pay her $500.
The store owner agreed and said that he would bring the money the
following day. The next day, however, when the store owner went to
the clerk's office with $500, he was told that she had been fired.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “Any person who shall give
or accept a fee not authorized by law as consideration for the act of
any public employee is guilty of bribery, a felony. Any person who
shall offer to commit a bribery is guilty of bribery in the second
degree, a felony.”

If the jurisdiction applies the common law definition of conspiracy, of
which of the following crimes can the clerk properly be convicted?

(A) Bribery in the second degree only.

(B) Conspiracy to commit bribery only.

(C) Bribery in the second degree or conspiracy to commit bribery, but

not both.

(D) Bribery in the second degree and conspiracy to commit bribery.

10. The defendant called her attorney and asked whether it would be a

crime to burn down her own home. The attorney said that arson was
defined as the intentional burning of any dwelling and that arson was a
serious crime. In fact, the defendant's attorney was incorrect: The
applicable statute in the jurisdiction defines arson as “the intentional
burning of the dwelling of another.” Believing what the attorney told
her, however, the defendant burned down her own home for the
purpose of collecting the proceeds of her fire insurance policy.

If the defendant is charged with attempted arson, she should be found

(A) guilty, because a mistake of fact does not prevent a person from

being guilty of a criminal attempt.

(B) guilty, because her mistake of law resulted from reasonable

451

reliance on the advice of an attorney.

(C) not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to burn the dwelling

of another.

(D) not guilty, because the defendant's attempt is subsumed in the

substantive crime of insurance fraud.

11. Angry because her coworker had insulted her, the defendant decided to
get revenge. Because she worked for an exterminator, the defendant
had access to cans of a poison gas that was often used to kill termites
and other insects. She did not want to kill the coworker, so she
carefully read the user manual supplied by the manufacturer. The
manual said that the gas was not fatal to human beings, but that
exposure to it could cause serious ailments, including blindness and
permanent respiratory irritation. When she was sure that no one would
see her, the defendant brought a can of the gas to the parking lot and
released the poison gas into the coworker's car. At lunchtime, the
coworker and his friend sat together in the coworker's car. As a result
of their exposure to the gas in the car, the friend died, and the coworker
became so ill that he was hospitalized for over a month.

If the defendant is charged with the murder of the friend, she should be
found

(A) guilty, because the friend's death resulted from an act that the

defendant performed with the intent to cause great bodily harm to a
human being.

(B) guilty, because the use of poison gas is an inherently dangerous

activity.

(C) not guilty, because she did not know that the friend would be

exposed to the poison gas.

(D) not guilty, because she did not intend to cause the death of any

person.

12. The defendant was charged with the attempted murder of the victim. If
only one of the following facts or inferences were true, which would
be most likely to result in an acquittal?

(A) The victim was already dead when the defendant shot him, although

the defendant believed him to be alive.

(B) The victim was alive when the defendant shot him, although the

452

defendant believed that the victim was already dead.

(C) The defendant's gun was unloaded when he aimed it at the victim
and pulled the trigger, although the defendant believed it to be
loaded.

(D) Intending to poison the victim, the defendant put a harmless

substance into the victim's drink, although the defendant believed
that the substance was lethal.

13. The defendant had been arraigned on a charge of burglarizing the home
of the victim. The day before the defendant's trial, the defendant was
told that he was to appear in a lineup. The defendant asked for his
lawyer to be present at the lineup but was told that he had no right to
his lawyer's presence. When he refused to appear in the lineup, the
officers said “Things will go bad for you if you refuse.” The defendant
then appeared in the lineup. There were five other men in the lineup,
and all were of approximately the same height, weight, and skin color
as the defendant.

At the defendant's trial, the victim testified that she had been returning
home on the night of the burglary when she saw a man running from her
house. She said that she recognized the defendant as the man whom she
had identified as the burglar at a lineup the day before.

If the defendant's attorney makes a timely objection to the
identification made by the victim, the court should

(A) sustain the objection, because the defendant was entitled to have

his attorney present at the lineup.

(B) sustain the objection, because the defendant's refusal to participate

in the lineup was overcome by force or the threat of force.

(C) overrule the objection, because there were five other men in the

lineup and all were of approximately the same height, weight, and
skin color as the defendant.

(D) overrule the objection, because any taint connected with the lineup

procedure has been purged by the victim's subsequent re-
identification of the defendant in the courtroom.

14. Because many neighborhood residents had been complaining about the
exploitation of tenants by absentee landlords and about the lack of law
enforcement in their poor neighborhood, the City Attorney instituted a

453

campaign of neighborhood reform. The City Attorney obtained a series
of warrants for inspection of buildings in the neighborhood. He
accomplished this by presenting an affidavit that stated that many health
and safety violations had been observed in buildings located in the
neighborhood by police and building inspectors traveling through the
neighborhood. Pursuant to the warrants, police officers and building
inspectors were ordered to inspect certain buildings. As a result, an
apartment building owned by the defendant was found to have more
than 20 violations of the city's building code. The defendant was
prosecuted under a state law that made it a felony for any landlord to
willfully fail to correct health and safety violations in a building that he
or she owned.

If the defendant moves to suppress the evidence against him that was
obtained as a result of the inspection of his building, his motion should
be

(A) granted, because the inspections were part of a general scheme to

enforce the law in a particular neighborhood only.

(B) denied, because the affidavit that was submitted in support of the
request for a warrant specifically stated that violations had been
observed in the defendant's building.

(C) denied, because no warrant is needed to inspect buildings for

health or safety violations.

(D) denied, because there was probable cause to believe that violations

would be found in some of the buildings.

15. On the defendant's birthday, his friend gave him a new television as a
gift. The following day, when the defendant opened the box and began
using the television, he noticed that there was no warranty document
with it. The defendant phoned his friend and asked the friend for the
missing warranty document. The friend said, “I can't give it to you
because the television was stolen.” The defendant kept the television
and continued using it.

The defendant was guilty of

(A) receiving stolen property only.

(B) larceny only.

(C) receiving stolen property and larceny.

454

(D) no crime.

16. In which of the following fact situations is the defendant most likely to

be convicted of the crime charged? Assume that the jurisdiction
applies the common law definition of all crimes.

(A) The defendant offered an acquaintance $1,000 to burn down the
defendant's factory, but the acquaintance refused. The defendant
was charged with solicitation to commit arson.

(B) The defendant deliberately burned down his home and collected the
proceeds of his fire insurance policy. The defendant was charged
with larceny by trick.

(C) The defendant deliberately burned down the victim's store because
he wanted to put the victim out of business. The defendant was
charged with arson.

(D) The defendant attempted to burn down his neighbor's house because
he disliked his neighbor. He poured gasoline on the door of the
house and threw a match onto it. The flames had just charred the
door when it started to rain and the fire went out. The defendant
was charged with arson.

17. The defendant was arrested and driven to police headquarters. A
police officer gave the defendant his Miranda warnings and the
defendant said he wanted to speak with his lawyer before talking to
anyone. Just then, the police officer was called away to help deal with
a drunken man that was fighting in one of the holding cells. An hour
later, another officer leaned in the room asked the defendant, “Do you
need anything?” The defendant replied, “Yeah — a good lawyer
because everyone knows I stabbed that guy.”

At trial, the defendant filed a motion to prevent the introduction of his
statement. How should the court rule?

(A) The court should deny the motion, because the defendant

volunteered the statement.

(B) The court should deny the motion, because there was no indication

the delay in contacting the lawyer was intentional.

(C) The court should grant the motion, because the statement was the

product of an unlawful “two-step” interrogation.

(D) The court should grant the motion, because the defendant's request

455

for an attorney should have been granted immediately.

18. A small but valuable piece of jewel-encrusted statuary had been stolen
from an antiques shop, and all foot patrol officers in the area were
notified by walkie-talkie to look for the thief. When an officer saw the
defendant running down the street away from the direction of the
antiques shop, she became suspicious of him. The officer stopped the
defendant and asked him his name and his reason for running down the
street. When the defendant said, “Just jogging,” the officer ordered him
to raise his hands and then frisked him to see if he was in possession of
the stolen statue. She felt a hard object in his pocket and, believing it to
be the statue, reached inside. The object that she felt turned out to be a
pistol, for which the defendant did not have a permit as required by
law.

Prior to the defendant's trial on the charge of unlawfully possessing a
concealed weapon, he moved to suppress the use of the pistol. His
motion should be

(A) granted, because it was obtained as the result of an unlawful

search.

(B) granted, because it was not the item that the officer was seeking

when she frisked him.

(C) denied, because the officer reasonably suspected him of stealing the

statue.

(D) denied, because it was discovered as part of a valid pat-down

search.

19. A boy overheard two other boys talking about killing the victim by

hiding his asthma medicine.

The boy hoped that the other boys' plan would succeed. He decided to
help them without saying anything about it. Going into the victim's
room, the boy searched until he found the medicine. Then he put it on a
night table so that the other boys would be sure to find it. One of the
two boys decided not to go through with the plan and ran away.
However, the other boy went to the room and threw away the
medicine. The victim had an asthma attack and died.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that persons the boy's age are
adults for purposes of criminal liability.

456

If the boy is charged with conspiracy, a court will probably find him

(A) guilty, because he knowingly aided and abetted in the commission

of a crime.

(B) guilty, because he committed an overt act in furtherance of an

agreement to throw away the victim's medicine.

(C) not guilty, because he did not agree to commit any crime.

(D) not guilty, because one of the boys effectively withdrew from any

conspiracy that existed.

20. As part of her campaign for reelection, the President of the United
States was driving through the main street of a city in a car with a
bubble-shaped roof made of bulletproof glass. Intending to shoot the
President, the defendant crouched on the roof of a building and aimed a
high-powered rifle at the glass top of his car. He fired three times,
striking the glass with each bullet. None of the bullets penetrated the
glass, and because of the noise of the cheering crowd, the President
was unaware that any shots had been fired. A police officer observed
the defendant firing at the President, however, and placed him under
arrest. The defendant was subsequently charged with violating a
federal statute that makes it a crime to attempt to assassinate the
President, and he was acquitted in a federal court.

If the defendant is prosecuted in the state court and charged with
criminal assault under state law, a court should find him

(A) not guilty, because he has already been acquitted in the federal

court.

(B) not guilty, because the President was unaware that shots had been

fired.

(C) guilty, because the defendant intended to hit the President with the

bullets.

(D) guilty, because the defendant's conduct would cause the reasonable

person to be placed in fear of his or her life.

21. A man had just been released from prison after serving a three-year

term for aggravated assault. In need of money, he called his old friend,
the defendant, and asked whether the defendant would be interested in
joining him in the robbery of a pawnshop. The defendant agreed, but
only after making the man promise that there would be no violence.

457

Upon the defendant's insistence, they carried realistic-looking toy guns,
and when they entered the pawnshop, they drew their toy guns and
ordered the store owner to give them all the money in his cash register
and all the gems in his safe. The store owner took a gun from the safe
and shot the man, killing him. The store owner then aimed the pistol at
the defendant, who fled from the store. By statute, the jurisdiction has
adopted the felony-murder rule.

If the defendant is charged with the murder of the man, the defendant's
most effective argument in defense is that

(A) the man was not a victim of the felony that resulted in his death.

(B) the store owner was justified in shooting the man.

(C) the use of toy guns made it unforeseeable that the robbery would

result in the death of any person.

(D) the defendant lacked malice aforethought.

22. Although the defendant had been licensed to drive for 15 years, he
allowed his license to expire while he was temporarily out of the
country. When he returned, he meant to get it renewed or reinstated but
did not get around to doing so. Although a statute made it a
misdemeanor to drive without a license, the defendant continued to
drive. One day, he accidentally dropped his cigarette while driving his
car. He felt around for it while he drove, until his fingers encountered
its glowing tip. Taking his eyes off the road for a moment to pick up the
still-burning cigarette, he failed to see the victim, who stepped out
from between parked cars. The defendant struck the victim, who died
instantly.

If the defendant is charged with homicide as a result of the victim's
death, which of the following would be the prosecutor's most effective
argument?

(A) The victim's death resulted from the defendant's commission of a

dangerous misdemeanor.

(B) The defendant's violation of the statute that required a driver's

license made him guilty of culpable negligence per se, since the
statute was designed to protect users of public roads against
unqualified drivers.

(C) While mere negligence is insufficient to sustain a murder charge, it

458

is sufficient to sustain a charge of involuntary manslaughter where
it results in death.

(D) The defendant created a high and unreasonable risk of death or
serious injury when he took his eyes off the road while driving.

23. A lifeguard worked from 5 P.M. to 10 P.M. every night at a public
swimming pool operated by the city. When she arrived at work
Wednesday evening, she asked her supervisor whether she could leave
early because she had a date. Since there were only a few people at the
pool, the supervisor said that the lifeguard could leave at 8 P.M. At 8
P.M., the lifeguard told the supervisor she was going and left, although
the pool had become quite crowded with adults and young children. At
9 P.M., a nine-year-old girl fell into the pool, striking her head against
its edge. One of the adults swimming in the pool saw the girl fall and
realized that the child would drown if someone did not rescue her. The
adult had seen the lifeguard leave and knew that there was no lifeguard
present, but she made no effort to rescue the girl, although the adult
was a strong swimmer and could easily have done so with no risk to
herself. The girl drowned.

If the lifeguard is charged with criminal homicide in the death of the
girl, which of the following would be her most effective argument in
defense?

(A) She was not present at the time of the drowning.

(B) Her duty to assist people in the swimming pool terminated when the

supervisor permitted her to leave at 8 P.M.

(C) The girl's death resulted from the adult's failure to render aid.

(D) She did not intend the girl's death.

24. The victim was addicted to heroin and frequently committed acts of

prostitution to obtain the money she needed to buy drugs. One night, she
was out looking for customers for prostitution when she was
approached by the defendant, who asked what her price was. When she
told him that she would have intercourse with him for $20, he said that
he would get the money from a friend and see her later. When the
victim went home several hours later, the defendant was waiting inside
her apartment. He said that he wanted to have sex with her, but when
the victim repeated her demand for $20, he said that he had no money.
She told him to get out or she would call the police. The defendant took

459

a knife from his pocket, saying that if she did not have intercourse with
him, he would kill her. Silently, the victim took off her clothes and had
intercourse with him. Afterwards, when the defendant fell asleep, the
victim beat him with a lamp.

If the defendant is charged with rape, the court should find him

(A) guilty, because he overcame the victim's refusal to have intercourse

with him by threatening to kill her with his knife.

(B) not guilty, because the victim's demand for $20 made her resistance

conditional and therefore less than total.

(C) not guilty, because the victim offered no resistance and the

defendant did not use physical force.

(D) not guilty, because of the injuries inflicted by the victim.

25. A woman was in her eighth month of pregnancy when her husband left
her. Unwilling to face life as a single parent, she asked her doctor to
perform an abortion. Her doctor refused, explaining that abortion so
late in pregnancy could be dangerous. The woman's cousin, the
defendant, had graduated from medical school and was waiting for
news about whether she had passed the state medical board's licensing
exam. The woman asked the defendant to abort the pregnancy, saying
that she would kill herself if the defendant refused. Reluctantly, the
defendant agreed to perform the abortion in the woman's kitchen. The
defendant performed a surgical procedure that usually resulted in
abortion, but because the pregnancy had advanced as far as it did, the
baby was alive when separated from the woman's body. The defendant
held the baby's head under water in an attempt to end his life, but after
a short time, her conscience bothered her. She pulled the baby from the
water and gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, directing the woman
to call an ambulance. When the ambulance arrived, the baby was
breathing on his own. He was taken to a hospital where, because of
brain damage, he remained in a coma until he died five years later.

If the defendant is charged with murdering the baby, her most effective
argument in defense would be that

(A) the woman had a constitutional right to an abortion.

(B) the defendant attempted to save the baby's life by giving him mouth-

to-mouth resuscitation.

460

(C) the baby's death five years later after the defendant's act was not

proximately caused by the defendant's act.

(D) the defendant lacked the necessary state of mind to be guilty of
criminal homicide, because the surgical procedure that she
performed usually resulted in abortion.

26. The defendant shot the victim to death. She was subsequently charged

with voluntary manslaughter. Which of the following additional facts, if
true, would lead to an acquittal on that charge?

(A) At the time of the shooting, the defendant believed that the victim

was going to stab her, but the reasonable person in her place would
not have held that belief.

(B) At the time of the shooting, the reasonable person in the defendant's
place would have believed that the victim was going to stab the
defendant, but the defendant did not hold that belief.

(C) At the time of the shooting, the defendant did not know whether the

victim was going to stab her.

(D) At the time of the shooting, the defendant mistakenly, but

reasonably, believed that the victim was going to stab her.

27. Two students were law students in the same Contracts class. Knowing
that the professor kept his lecture notes in a cabinet in his office, they
planned to break into the office for the purpose of copying his notes.
The first student purchased a miniature camera for this purpose after
discussing the purchase with the second student and collecting half the
cost from her. When they saw the professor leave his office at
lunchtime, they went there. The second student opened the locked door
by slipping a strip of plastic under its latch. Once inside the office, the
first student found the professor's notes and photographed them with the
camera that he had purchased.

Of which of the following crimes may the first student properly be
convicted?

(A) Conspiracy to commit burglary.

(B) Conspiracy to commit larceny.

(C) Both conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to commit

larceny.

461

(D) Neither conspiracy to commit burglary nor conspiracy to commit

larceny.

28. The defendant and his friend were trying to become stuntmen, so they

filmed several stunt videos and posted them to the Internet. To continue
to attract views, they made the stunt videos increasingly elaborate. In
their latest video, the defendant's friend ran in front of a concrete wall
while the defendant shot at him with a pistol. After the first take, the
friend said, “You need to shoot closer to me, so it looks a lot cooler.”
In the second take, the defendant shot as close as he could to his friend.
One of the bullets ricocheted off the wall and struck the friend in the
head. He was killed instantly.

What is the most serious crime the defendant can be charged with?

(A) Murder.

(B) Voluntary manslaughter.

(C) Involuntary manslaughter.

(D) No crime.

29. A hunter earned his living by catching poisonous reptiles for sale to
zoos and private collectors. He had been commissioned to capture a
rare, highly poisonous species of snake. The hunter hired a
professional chemist to develop and manufacture a drug that he could
take before handling this particular snake, and which would protect
him against the reptile's poison in the event that he was bitten. Although
the chemist knew that the bite of the snake was usually fatal, and that
there was no defense against its venom, she welcomed the opportunity
to earn some easy money. She sold the hunter a bottle of tablets, telling
him that they were based on her secret formula and that they would
protect him against the snake's venom. Actually, the tablets were made
of nothing more than sugar, but the chemist thought that if the hunter
believed strongly enough in their power, he would handle the snakes so
confidently that he would not be bitten. The hunter caught a snake and
took one of the chemist's tablets before handling it, following the
instructions that she had given him. While he was handling the snake, it
bit him. Because the tablets did not protect him against the venom, the
hunter became ill as a result of the snakebite and almost died.

If the chemist is prosecuted for her sale of the tablets to the hunter, she
may properly be found guilty of

462

(A) attempted murder only.

(B) obtaining property by false pretenses only.

(C) attempted murder and obtaining property by false pretenses.

(D) neither attempted murder nor obtaining property by false pretenses.

30. The defendant purchased an ounce of cocaine and divided it into 50

packets of about one-half gram each. She was selling them outside the
local high school when a drug addict noticed her and saw the
opportunity to get some free drugs. The drug addict stepped up beside
her. With his hand in the pocket of his jacket, he thrust his finger
forward inside the pocket and jabbed her in the ribs with it. Snarling,
he said, “I've got a gun. Give me the dope or I'll blow you away.” The
defendant reached into her purse, drew a small pistol that she kept
there, and shot the drug addict, killing him.

If the defendant is charged with the murder of the drug addict, she
should be found

(A) guilty, because it was unreasonable for her to use deadly force to

protect illegal contraband.

(B) guilty, because the drug addict was unarmed.

(C) guilty, because the defendant was committing a crime and therefore

had no privilege of self-defense.

(D) not guilty, because it was reasonable for her to believe that her life

was in danger.

31. The defendant and his brother ran a methamphetamine lab in their

home. An undercover officer went to the home and tried to buy a large
quantity of drugs. As the undercover officer was paying, his police
radio went off. The defendant's brother yelled, “Police!” and grabbed a
nearby shotgun the brothers kept to defend their lab. He then shot the
undercover officer in the leg. Other officers stormed the house and
arrested both the defendant and his brother. Both of them were charged
with conspiracy to sell methamphetamine and battery for the shooting
of the officer.

At trial, the defendant argued he was not guilty of battery because he
was not the one who shot the officer. How should the court rule?

(A) Guilty, because the brother was defending the lab when he shot the

463

officer.

(B) Guilty, because the defendant acted with reckless indifference in

keeping the shotgun on the property to defend the lab.

(C) Not guilty, because the defendant did not shoot the undercover

officer.

(D) Not guilty, because the sale of methamphetamine is not an

inherently dangerous crime.

32. After looking at a car that the seller had advertised for sale, the buyer
agreed to purchase it for $3,000. The buyer gave the seller $100 cash,
promising to bring the balance and to pick up the car the following day.
In fact, the seller was a thief who had no intention of selling the car and
had been collecting cash in down payments from buyers all over the
state. As soon as the buyer left, the seller ran off with the $100. One
week later, the seller was arrested and charged with embezzlement and
larceny by trick. He can properly be convicted of

(A) embezzlement only.

(B) larceny by trick only.

(C) embezzlement and larceny by trick.

(D) neither embezzlement nor larceny by trick.

33. A wife was extremely hot-tempered and very possessive of her

husband. She frequently flew into a hysterical rage if he even looked at
another woman. One evening, the wife and the husband were in a bar
when they began arguing. Wanting to hurt his wife, and knowing that it
would infuriate her, the husband asked a waitress, who was sitting at
the next table, to dance with him. The waitress accepted, but as she and
the husband began to dance, the wife became enraged and ran at them,
striking the husband over the head with a wine bottle. Later that night,
the husband died of a head injury resulting from the blow. The wife
was charged with murder, but her lawyer argued that the charge should
be reduced to voluntary manslaughter because the wife was acting out
of extreme passion when she struck the husband. Is the wife's lawyer
correct?

(A) Yes, on the theory of deliberate provocation.

(B) Yes, because of the wife's extreme feelings of possessiveness

regarding her husband.

464

(C) No, because the ordinary person in the wife's situation would not
have become violently enraged by the husband's dancing with the
waitress.

(D) No, on the theory of mistaken justification.

34. The company was a retailer of computer hardware and software. It
frequently sold its products on credit, and credit customers were
required to execute security agreements giving the company, in the
event of default in payment, the right to repossess the goods sold
without resort to judicial proceedings. The defendant was employed by
the company as a collection agent. As such, his job was to contact
customers whose payments were past due and to repossess computer
hardware when necessary.

One night, the defendant went to a customer's home to demand that she
either make her payments or return the computer hardware. Although
he heard a radio playing inside the apartment, no one answered his
knock. The defendant tried the door, thinking that his knock might not
have been heard over the sound of the radio. Finding the door
unlocked, he opened it and entered the apartment. He called the
customer's name as he walked from room to room, but found that
nobody was home. He was about to leave when he saw the computer
hardware that the customer had purchased from the company on a
table. He left a signed note that said, “Because of non-payment, I have
repossessed your computer.” He then took the equipment with him.

If the defendant is charged with common law burglary, which of the
following would be his most effective argument in defense?

(A) He did not use force to make an entry.

(B) He did not enter by “breaking” since the door was not locked.

(C) When he opened the door and entered the apartment, he had no

intention of committing a crime.

(D) He left a note explaining his actions.

35. The defendant suffered a severe head injury in an accident that

occurred three years ago. As a result, she experienced eight incidents
of sudden unconsciousness, each lasting approximately two minutes.
All the incidents occurred within a three-month period immediately
following the accident, and all occurred while the defendant was at

465

home. Last week, she was driving her automobile in a lawful manner
when she suddenly lost consciousness as a result of the head injury.
Her car swerved out of control onto the sidewalk, striking and
permanently injuring a pedestrian. The defendant was charged with
violating a state statute that defines the crime of “reckless maiming” as
“causing permanent injury to another person by acting in knowing
disregard of the plain and strong likelihood that death or serious
personal injury will result.”

Which of the following is the defendant's most effective argument in
defense against the charge of reckless maiming?

(A) The defendant's head injury was not the result of any culpable

conduct by the defendant.

(B) After losing consciousness while driving, the defendant was no

longer capable of exercising control over the operation of her
vehicle.

(C) The defendant reasonably believed that she would not have any

further incidents of unconsciousness.

(D) The defendant did not know that her driving would lead to death or

serious injury.

36. During a trip across the United States, a man used an Internet company
that allowed people to rent out their homes to travelers. The man
picked a nice home near the Grand Canyon that the defendant was
renting out while he was away on business. While staying in the home,
the man stumbled across a used syringe in a trash can. Because he
suspected the defendant was engaged in criminal activity, the man
searched the home and discovered several bags of heroin in the
defendant's closets. The man took the drug evidence to the local police.
Based on this evidence, the police arrested the defendant as soon as he
returned.

If the defendant makes an appropriate motion to suppress the evidence,
the motion should be

(A) granted, because by turning the evidence over to the police, the man

acted as a de facto agent of the government.

(B) granted, because the man intentionally searched for drug evidence

while staying in the home.

466

(C) granted, because the police used the evidence in arresting the

defendant.

(D) denied.

37. The defendant came home from work to find that his wife and two of

his children had been slashed and cut and were lying dead in a pool of
blood. His third child was also cut and bleeding severely. As the
defendant approached, the child said, “Our neighbor killed Mommy.”
The defendant said, “I'll kill that son of a bitch.” Then he loaded his
shotgun and went next door to the neighbor's house. He knocked on the
door, and the neighbor opened the door and said, “I killed your family,
what are you going to do about it?” The defendant shot and killed him.
State statutes codify the common law definitions of voluntary and
involuntary manslaughter, and define first degree murder as “the
deliberate and premeditated killing of a human being,” and second
degree murder as “the killing of a human being with malice
aforethought.”

If the defendant is charged with voluntary manslaughter, the court
should find him

(A) guilty, because he intended the death of the neighbor because he
believed that the neighbor had killed his wife and children,

(B) guilty, because the killing of the neighbor was deliberate and

premeditated.

(C) not guilty, because the killing of the neighbor was deliberate and

premeditated.

(D) not guilty, because the neighbor was the killer of the defendant's

wife and children.

38. The defendant was the chief cashier at a supermarket. As part of her

duties, she deposited the day's receipts in the company safe each night.
One Friday night, when the store was to be closed for the entire
weekend, after depositing the day's receipts in the safe, the defendant
removed $500 from the safe without permission. She knew that no one
would be looking for the money in the safe during the weekend and
planned to take it with her on a gambling junket to Las Vegas. Her
intentions were to gamble with the money, and, if she won, to return it
on Monday morning. If she lost, she planned to alter the store records
to hide the fact that the money was missing.

467

On Monday morning, the defendant returned to the supermarket.
Having won a few hundred dollars during her weekend gambling trip,
she returned the money that she had taken from the safe. One of her
coworkers saw her returning the money and questioned her about it
until the defendant admitted what she had done. The coworker stopped
her before she closed the safe and said that unless the defendant gave
him $25 of the store's money, he would tell the boss. The defendant
knew that she could get away with taking $25 because the store
records were frequently off by that much and the boss never worried
about it. Thus, she took out $25 from the safe and gave it to the
coworker.

If the defendant is charged with larceny for taking $500 from the safe
on Friday night, she should be found

(A) not guilty, because the owner of the supermarket was not deprived

of its use.

(B) not guilty, because when she took the money, she intended to return

it if she won.

(C) guilty, because she withheld $25 on Monday morning.

(D) guilty, because she planned to keep the money if she lost.

39. A statute provides as follows: “Any person who knowingly sells an
intoxicating substance to a person under the age of 21 years shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor.” The owner of a cocktail lounge hired the
defendant to work as her bartender. Before the defendant began
working, the owner read him the above statute and explained the need
for him to check the identification of all persons who appeared to be
under the age of 21 years. She also told him that if she ever heard of
his violating the statute, she would fire him immediately. Later that
night, a 17-year-old teenager who looked like he was 25 ordered a
glass of wine. The teenager showed the defendant an altered driver's
license that falsely stated his age to be 22. The defendant was not sure
whether the phrase intoxicating substance in the statute included wine,
and he served it to the teenager. An undercover police officer who was
at the bar observed the transaction. Hoping to make an arrest, the
officer deliberately waited until after the wine was served. He then
showed his badge, demanding to see the teenager's identification.
Recognizing the driver's license as a forgery, he arrested the defendant.

468

If the defendant is charged with violating the statute, his most effective
argument in defense is that

(A) he did not know whether the statutory phrase intoxicating

substance included wine.

(B) he reasonably believed the teenager to be over the age of 21 years.

(C) the undercover police officer entrapped him.

(D) the wine was not an intoxicating substance because the teenager

never got a chance to drink it.

40. A state law requires automobiles to be equipped with a device to

reduce the emission of air-polluting substances and provides that any
person who knowingly removes such a device from an automobile
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The defendant was the operator of an
automobile service station at which she conducted minor repairs. The
victim brought her car to the defendant's station and asked whether
there was anything that the defendant could do to improve the car's fuel
economy. The defendant said that removing the air-pollution control
device would make the car use less fuel, and she offered to do so for a
fee. The victim paid the fee, and the defendant removed the device.
Although the defendant worked carefully, she accidentally loosened a
connection in the exhaust system without knowing she had done so.
However, she did know that such leaks could result in death. When the
victim drove away, exhaust gases were leaking from the exhaust system
into the victim's car. After driving for a short time, the victim was
poisoned by the gases and died.

If the defendant is prosecuted for the homicide of the victim, she
should be found

(A) guilty of involuntary manslaughter under the unlawful act doctrine,
because the victim's death would not have occurred but for the
defendant's removal of the air-pollution control device.

(B) guilty of voluntary manslaughter, because she knew there was a

possibility that death could result from a leak in the exhaust system.

(C) guilty of involuntary manslaughter, because an automobile is a
dangerous instrumentality and the defendant was culpably
negligent.

(D) not guilty.

469

41. After closing down his restaurant at 3 A.M. the defendant was getting in
his car to go home when he felt something sharp and metal jab him in
the back. A low voice growled, “I've got a gun. Give me your wallet or
I'll shoot you right here.” Because of several recent thefts in the area,
the defendant habitually carried a large kitchen knife in his coat pocket.
The defendant spun around and stabbed the “robber” in the chest. The
“robber” fell down to the ground dead. The defendant then realized that
the “robber” was actually the owner of the competing restaurant next
door, who was well known for playing practical jokes, and the “gun”
was simply the round handle of a metal spatula. The defendant was
arrested and charged with murder.

If the defendant asserts that he acted in self-defense, he should be
found

(A) not guilty, because the defendant was justified in believing he was

about to be robbed.

(B) not guilty, because the defendant's belief that the “robber” would

shoot him was reasonable.

(C) guilty, because the defendant did not turn around and verify that the

“robber” was actually holding a gun.

(D) guilty, because it was unreasonable to spin around and stab an

unknown person with a kitchen knife.

42. The defendant was a narcotics addict in desperate need of a shot. He

offered to permit a drug dealer to have sexual intercourse with his wife
in return for drugs. The drug dealer accepted the offer and went home
with the defendant. When the defendant told his wife about the
arrangement, however, she refused to have any contact with the drug
dealer. The defendant struck her several times and held her down
while the drug dealer had intercourse with her forcibly. Afterwards,
the drug dealer handed a packet of heroin to the defendant.

Which of the following is the most serious crime of which the
defendant can be found guilty?

(A) Rape.

(B) Battery.

(C) Procuring for prostitution.

470

(D) Possession of narcotics.

43. The defendant was about to go to his sister's wedding when he

remembered that he had inadvertently left his camera at his friend's
house. Although he knew that his friend was out of town, the defendant
went to his friend's house in the hope of finding some way to get the
camera so that he could take pictures at the wedding. The door was
locked, but when the defendant shook the doorknob vigorously with his
hand, the door opened. The defendant entered and searched for his
camera, but he could not find it. As he was leaving, he saw a silver
candy dish on a shelf with several other items and took it to give his
sister as a wedding present. He subsequently changed his mind,
however, and returned it to his friend.

Of which of the following crimes may the defendant properly be
convicted?

(A) Larceny.

(B) Burglary.

(C) Attempted burglary.

(D) No crime.

44. The defendant was a nightclub performer who was billed as “the man
with second sight.” As part of his nightclub act, he would put on a
blindfold and walk between the tables, identifying the contents of
pockets and purses of members of the audience. One day, as a publicity
stunt, he had himself blindfolded and attempted to drive an automobile
in rush-hour traffic. Because he was unable to see the road, he collided
with the vehicle in front of him. As a result of the impact, the other
vehicle burst into flames and three of its occupants were severely
burned, one so badly that he permanently lost the use of his legs. If they
had not been rescued by a fire company that happened to be passing by,
all three would have died.

On a charge of attempted involuntary manslaughter, the defendant
should be found

(A) guilty, since his reckless behavior nearly resulted in the death of

another human being.

(B) guilty, since he had completed all steps necessary to result in guilt
for involuntary manslaughter, and the deaths of the victims were

471

prevented by an independent agency.

(C) not guilty, since he lacked the requisite state of mind to be liable for

an attempt.

(D) not guilty, since the crime of involuntary manslaughter is a lesser

offense included in murder.

45. A state statute provides that “any person who brings about the death of
another human being with the intent to cause said death or in the course
of committing burglary, rape, robbery, or kidnapping shall be guilty of
murder in the first degree.” The jurisdiction applies common law
definitions for the four enumerated felonies. The defendant was
attempting to use dynamite to blow open the door of a warehouse so
that he could enter to steal its contents. His accomplice was waiting in
the getaway car parked at the curb. When the defendant detonated the
charge, the resulting explosion damaged the building wall, causing
bricks and chunks of mortar to fly through the air. A brick crashed
through the windshield of the getaway car, striking the accomplice in
the head and killing him.

If the defendant is charged with murder in the first degree, which of the
following arguments would be his most effective defense?

(A) The statute was not intended to protect the accomplice of a felon.

(B) Burglary as defined by common law is not a dangerous felony.

(C) The accomplice's death was not proximately caused by the

defendant's attempt to commit any of the crimes enumerated by the
statute.

(D) The accomplice assumed the risk by participating in the

commission of a felony.

46. The defendant, who had applied for employment with a company,

learned that the decision as to whether to hire him would be made by
the company's personnel manager. Anxious to receive the job, the
defendant offered to give the personnel manager his first week's pay if
the personnel manager would hire him. The personnel manager
accepted the defendant's offer and hired him, later accepting the
payment. Subsequently, the defendant and the personnel manager were
both charged with violating a state law that provided that “it shall be a
felony for any person with responsibility for hiring others to solicit,
demand, or receive anything of value from persons hired in exchange

472

for hiring said persons.” They were tried jointly, the personnel
manager as a principal and the defendant as an accessory.

The defendant's best argument for a dismissal of the charge against him
is that

(A) a person cannot be tried as an accessory until the principal has first

been tried and convicted.

(B) he did not assist the personnel manager in the commission of the

crime.

(C) no person can be charged as an accessory if the crime could not

have been committed without his or her participation.

(D) the law was intended to protect people in the defendant's position

against people in the personnel manager's position.

47. The defendant, in need of money, waited in an alley until the victim
walked by on the street. Then, stepping out of the alley, he stuck his
hand in his pocket with his finger thrust forward and said, “I've got a
gun in this pocket.” Snatching the victim's purse with the other hand, he
ran away. Because she thought that he had a gun, the victim did not
attempt to stop him.

Of which of the following offenses would the defendant be most likely
to be properly convicted?

(A) Robbery.

(B) Larceny by trick.

(C) Embezzlement.

(D) False pretenses.

48. When a doctor went away on vacation, he left the key to his apartment
with his neighbor, the defendant, who promised to water the doctor's
plants until he returned. One day, as the defendant was watering the
doctor's plants, she suspected one of them to be marijuana. She
watered the rest of the plants and then went to the public library, where
she consulted a reference book and found that the suspicious plant was
indeed marijuana. She went back to the doctor's apartment and let
herself in with the key. Then she pulled the marijuana plant out by its
roots and destroyed it by stuffing it into the garbage disposal in her
own apartment.

473

The jurisdiction applies the common law definition of larceny and has
a statute defining burglary as “breaking and entering into the premises
of another for the purpose of committing larceny.” If charged with
larceny and burglary, the defendant should be found guilty of

(A) larceny only.

(B) burglary only.

(C) larceny and burglary.

(D) neither larceny nor burglary.

49. In the course of robbing a bank, the defendant pointed a gun at three
bank tellers and the bank manager and ordered them to go from the
bank lobby to the back room while his confederate attempted to open
the safe. Threatening to shoot them if they refused, he then ordered one
of the bank tellers to undress and commanded the bank manager to have
sexual intercourse with her. Fearful that they would be killed
otherwise, the manager and teller obeyed the defendant's commands
without protesting.

Of which of the following crimes is the defendant guilty?

(A) Solicitation to commit rape.

(B) Rape.

(C) Both solicitation to commit rape and rape.

(D) Neither solicitation to commit rape nor rape.

50. The defendant sold a pistol to a man. Later, the man was stopped by

police who were routinely checking the licenses of motorists. The man
objected to a search of his car, but the officers ignored him. The
officers thoroughly searched the man's car and discovered the pistol in
the glove compartment. Subsequently, the defendant was charged with
violating a statute that makes it a crime for any person “to sell or offer
for sale any firearm that has not been properly registered pursuant to
law.”

The defendant's motion to prevent introduction of the pistol into
evidence will most likely be

(A) denied, since the routine license check was not a violation of the

man's rights.

474

(B) denied, because the defendant has no standing to object to the

search of the man's car.

(C) granted, because the man objected to the search of his car at the

time it took place.

(D) granted, because the search of the man's car was excessive in

scope.

51. A man broke into a church in order to desecrate it. He planned to do so
by sacrificing a squirrel on top of the altar. When he got inside the
church, the squirrel bit him on the finger and escaped. The man
believed desecrating a church was a felony, but there were actually no
laws at all regarding desecration. If the man is charged with burglary,
he should be

(A) convicted, because he intended to commit a felony when he broke

into the church.

(B) convicted, because he would have completed his intended crime if

the squirrel hadn't escaped.

(C) acquitted, because he could only be charged with attempted

burglary.

(D) acquitted, because what he intended to do was not a crime.

52. The defendant belonged to a sorority. Members of the sorority who

paid a rent of $100 per semester were entitled to a single-occupancy
bedroom in the sorority house. Although house residents shared kitchen
and dining room facilities, the bedrooms were not communal and were
normally kept locked by their occupants. With the knowledge of its
members, the sorority kept duplicates of all keys so that copies could
be made in the event that a resident lost her key. A student, a member of
the sorority, suspected that the defendant was selling marijuana. One
weekend, when she knew that the defendant had gone home to visit her
parents, the student called the police and told them of her suspicions. In
response to her call, two officers came to the sorority house to
interview the student. During the course of their conversation, the
student stated that she was the defendant's roommate and offered to let
them into the defendant's room. In fact, the student was not the
defendant's roommate. The key that she used to open the door was
actually one of the duplicates kept by the sorority. Upon entering, the
police officers saw a tobacco pipe containing traces of marijuana
residue on a night table. The defendant was subsequently prosecuted

475

for possession of marijuana. Prior to trial, she made an appropriate
motion to suppress the use of the pipe and its contents as evidence.

Which of the following would be the prosecution's strongest argument
in opposition to the defendant's motion?

(A) The student had apparent authority to permit the entry into the room.

(B) The student had probable cause to believe that the officers would

find marijuana in the room.

(C) The defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy

since she knew that the sorority kept a duplicate of her room key.

(D) The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search

and seizure should not be strictly applied to students at educational
institutions.

53. Because they were bigots, a man and a woman were angry when a

black family moved into a house on their street. Deciding to drive them
away and to set an example that would discourage other black people
from moving into the neighborhood, they agreed to set fire to the
family's home. They went to the house, and the man started pouring
gasoline around it. A crowd of onlookers began to gather. The
defendant, one of the onlookers, shouted, “Burn their house down!”
intending that the man and the woman would do so. After the man
finished pouring the gasoline, the woman lit a match and set it afire,
burning the house to the ground.

On a charge of arson, the defendant is

(A) guilty, because he aided and abetted in the crime by his presence,

coupled with his criminal intent.

(B) guilty, because, intending that the man and the woman would burn

the house down, he shouted encouragement.

(C) not guilty, because his words did not create a clear and present

danger that did not already exist.

(D) not guilty, because words alone are not sufficient to result in

criminal liability.

54. The defendant was a resident patient at the state mental hospital, where
he had been receiving treatment for a mental illness diagnosed as
chronic paranoid schizophrenia. As a result of his illness, he believed

476

that the governor of his state was part of a nationwide plot to turn all
voting citizens into drug addicts. He felt that the only way to foil the
plot was to kill the governor, but he realized that the law prohibited
such an act. He knew that if he was caught making any attempt on the
governor's life, he would be punished, but he concluded that it would
be better to be convicted and punished for a crime than to be turned
into a drug addict. Ultimately, he was unable to resist his impulse to
kill the governor, and, in the context of his delusion, his conduct
seemed reasonable.

On the governor's next visit, the defendant placed poison in food he
knew would be served to the governor, intending to cause the
governor's death. The governor ate the food and died as a result. If the
defendant is charged with murder in a jurisdiction that has adopted
only the M'Naghten test of insanity, the defendant should be found

(A) guilty, since he knew the nature of his act and that it was prohibited

by law.

(B) not guilty, because the defendant can establish that his mental

illness made him unable to resist the impulse to kill the governor.

(C) not guilty, since the defendant's conduct was the result of mental

illness.

(D) not guilty, because his delusion was the result of mental disease
and if his conduct was reasonable within the context of that
delusion.

55. In which of the following situations is the defendant's claim of

intoxication most likely to result in his or her being found not guilty?

(A) In a jurisdiction that applies the common law definition, the

defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of
a pedestrian whom she struck while driving an automobile. The
defendant asserts that at the time of the accident, she was so drunk
that she did not see the pedestrian in the roadway.

(B) In a jurisdiction in which the statutory age of consent is 18, the
defendant is charged with statutory rape after having sexual
intercourse with a female who was 17 years of age. The defendant
asserts that he was so intoxicated that he did not realize that he was
engaging in sexual intercourse.

(C) In a jurisdiction that applies the common law definition, the

477

defendant is charged with murder for the death of a person whom
she struck with her automobile. The defendant asserts that, without
her knowledge, an unknown person put alcohol in her fruit juice, as
a result of which she became so intoxicated that she could not see
clearly or control the movements of her hands and feet. She further
asserts that, unaware that she was drunk, she believed the visual
and physical difficulties to be the result of illness and was
attempting to drive to a hospital when the accident occurred.

(D) In a jurisdiction that applies the common law definition, the

defendant is charged with voluntary manslaughter after killing his
wife. He asserts that he was so drunk that he imagined that he saw
another man in bed with her, and that he killed her in the drunken
rage that resulted.

56. In which one of the following situations is the defendant LEAST likely

to be guilty of murder?

(A) Having been hired by a third person to beat the victim severely

enough to “put her in the hospital,” the defendant struck the victim
repeatedly with a baseball bat in the knees. Although the defendant
intended only to break the victim's legs, she died of shock.

(B) Because he suffers from mental disease, the defendant believed the
victim to be Adolf Hitler. Intending to kill him, the defendant shot
him to death.

(C) Believing the victim to be asleep, the defendant fired 10 bullets

into his head. In fact, the victim had died of a heart attack moments
before the defendant entered the room and was already dead when
the defendant shot him.

(D) The defendant stole a check from the victim's mailbox and

attempted to cash it in a bank by masquerading as the victim.
Suspecting forgery, the bank teller signaled to the bank guard. As
the guard approached, the defendant shot at him. When the guard
returned the defendant's fire, one of the guard's bullets ricocheted
off a wall and struck a customer, killing him.

57. A landlord was the owner of a three-unit residential building. One day,
while the defendant and his wife were out of town, the landlord and a
police officer were having coffee together in the landlord's apartment.
During the course of their conversation, the landlord said that she was
worried about the defendant because once, while visiting him, she saw

478

a substance in his apartment that she believed to be cocaine. Since she
really did not know what cocaine looked like, however, she was not
sure. The officer said, “Don't worry. For all you know, the stuff you
saw was talcum powder. I'm a cop, so I know coke when I see it. If
you'd like, I'll have a look and let you know whether or not there is
anything for you to worry about.”

Using her key to open the door to the defendant's apartment, the
landlord brought the officer inside. Lying on a table in the entrance
hall inside the apartment was a plastic pouch containing white
powder. The officer sniffed it and said, “That's coke, all right,” putting
it in his pocket. Eventually, the defendant was charged with criminal
possession of dangerous drugs.

On the charge of possessing dangerous drugs, if the defendant makes
an appropriate motion to suppress use of the plastic pouch of cocaine
that the officer found in his apartment, his motion should be

(A) denied, since the plastic pouch was in plain sight when the officer

entered the apartment.

(B) denied, since the landlord, the owner of the building, had given the

officer permission to enter.

(C) denied, since the defendant was not under suspicion at the time that

the officer entered the apartment.

(D) granted.

58. When he was 19 years old, the defendant pleaded guilty to petty

larceny. Because of his age, he was not sentenced to prison, but he was
required to report to a Youth Supervision Officer every month for one
year. At the end of that period, he was discharged from supervision. At
the time, his attorney advised him that he was pleading guilty to a
“Youthful Offense” rather than to a crime, and that because he was
assigned to a Youth Supervision Officer, he would have no criminal
record as a result of the proceeding. The defendant believed this
advice, but it was in fact false, in that the charge to which he pleaded
guilty was a criminal one.

Twenty years later, the defendant applied for employment with the
state. In his application, he stated under oath that he had never been
convicted of a crime.

479

A state statute reads as follows:

“Perjury in the second degree consists of making any statement under
oath with the knowledge that such statement is false. Perjury in the
second degree is a felony punishable by a term not to exceed five
years in the state prison.”

If the defendant is charged with perjury in the second degree, the court
should find him

(A) not guilty, because he lacked the mental state required by the

statute.

(B) not guilty, because reliance on the advice of counsel is a complete

defense.

(C) not guilty, because a plea of guilty is not the same as a conviction.

(D) guilty.

59. A woman was a collector of antique automobiles. One day, she took
her infant daughter for a ride in one of the most valuable cars in her
collection. On her way, she stopped to buy a newspaper. Because her
daughter had fallen asleep in the backseat, the collector left her in the
car when she got out. The defendant, a professional car thief who
happened to be at the newspaper stand, jumped into the collector's car
and drove it away without noticing the daughter in the backseat.

The defendant realized that he would not be able to sell a stolen car as
unusual as this one, so he parked it in a friend's garage, still unaware
of the presence of the sleeping child. Getting the collector's name and
phone number from some papers in the glove compartment of the car,
the defendant phoned her and left a message on her voicemail, telling
her that if she did not immediately bring $1,000 in cash to a certain
location, he would set the car on fire.

Upon hearing the message, the collector brought $1,000 to the location
specified. The defendant, who was waiting for her, took the money and
returned the car. The daughter was still sleeping quietly in the
backseat.

If the defendant is charged with kidnapping, he should be found

(A) guilty, since he confined and moved the daughter without her

480

consent.

(B) guilty, since the asportation of the daughter resulted from his

commission of a serious felony.

(C) not guilty, since his primary purpose was to steal the car, and the

movement of the daughter was only incidental to his accomplishing
that purpose.

(D) not guilty, since he did not know that the daughter was in the car.

60. The defendant was driving across the border from Mexico. He arrived
at the border station. The border inspector asked him to open the trunk
of his car and began searching it. In the course of the search, the
inspector discovered three pounds of marijuana. The defendant was
subsequently charged with the illegal importation of a controlled
substance and was tried in a federal court. While his trial was pending,
the state charged him with violation of a state statute that provided that
“any person in possession of more than one ounce of marijuana shall
be guilty of a felony.” While the federal court trial is in progress, if the
defendant moves to dismiss the state court prosecution on the ground
that it violates the double jeopardy clause of the United States
Constitution, his motion should be

(A) granted, since both the prosecutions resulted from the same

transaction.

(B) granted, since the supervisor did not have probable cause for the

search.

(C) denied, since he has not yet been placed in jeopardy in the federal

court.

(D) denied, since the two prosecutions are not by the same sovereign.

61. Because he was a professional thief, the defendant owned a skeleton

key that could be used to open many different locks. One evening, when
he knew that the victim was away on vacation, the defendant went to
her home for the purpose of stealing cash that he believed was hidden
inside. While he was trying unsuccessfully to use his skeleton key to
open the victim's door, the defendant was arrested by a police officer.
In fact, the victim had placed her cash in a bank safety deposit box
before going on vacation, and her house contained nothing of value.

If charged with violating a statute that makes it a crime to “possess any

481

skeleton key with the intent to use it for the purpose of committing an
unlawful entry onto the property of another,” he should be found

(A) guilty, because the statute was designed to protect the public

against professional thieves.

(B) guilty, because he possessed a skeleton key with the intent to use it

for the purpose of committing an unlawful entry.

(C) not guilty, because the crime defined by the statute is merged into

the crime of attempted burglary.

(D) not guilty, because to convict him would be to punish him merely

for having a guilty mind.

62. A statute provides that “If the death of any person proximately results

from the commission of or attempt to commit any misdemeanor or non-
forcible felony, the person committing said misdemeanor or non-
forcible felony shall be guilty of third degree manslaughter.”

Because he had been convicted three times of driving while under the
influence of alcohol, the defendant's driving license was revoked. One
night, while driving home from a party, the defendant lost control of
his automobile and collided head-on with a vehicle traveling in the
other direction. Two occupants of the other car were killed. The
defendant was charged with driving without a license, which was a
misdemeanor, and with third degree manslaughter under the above
statute. Should the court find the defendant guilty of third degree
manslaughter?

(A) No, because driving without a license is not malum in se.

(B) Yes, because the deaths were proximately caused by his operation

of a motor vehicle without a license.

(C) Yes, because driving while intoxicated is a dangerous act.

(D) Yes, because he knew or should have known that driving without a

license could result in loss of life.

63. A student and the defendant were college students who needed money.
One night, the student suggested that they hold up a local convenience
store. When the defendant told her that she was afraid to get involved
in a robbery, the student offered to go into the store alone if the
defendant would wait outside in the car with the engine running so that
they could make a getaway after the robbery. The defendant agreed on

482

the condition that they split the take. The following day, they went
together to a sporting goods store, where the student purchased a
shotgun. That night, the defendant drove the student to the convenience
store and waited in the parking lot with the engine running. The student
went into the store with the shotgun hidden in a paper bag. Once inside,
she pointed it at the store clerk and made him give her the contents of
the cash register. Then she ran out to the car. When the defendant saw
the student running toward the car, she became frightened and drove
away without waiting for the student.

The defendant is guilty of

(A) conspiracy only.

(B) robbery only.

(C) conspiracy and robbery.

(D) either conspiracy or robbery, but not both.

64. In which of the following fact situations is the defendant LEAST likely

to be properly convicted of murder?

(A) The defendant came home to find his wife lying on the floor of their
apartment semi-conscious and severely bruised. When he asked her
what happened, she said that their neighbor had raped and beaten
her. The following morning, the defendant hid behind some bushes
waiting for the neighbor to leave his home. When the neighbor
stepped out of his door, the defendant, intending to kill him, shot
him, causing his death.

(B) A state law required every motor vehicle registered within the state

to be covered by a valid policy of liability insurance. The
defendant was operating a vehicle for which no liability insurance
policy had been issued when he struck a pedestrian, who later died
of the resulting injuries.

(C) The defendant placed a small quantity of ant poison in a cup of

coffee that he was serving to a date. He did not intend to cause any
serious injury, but he hoped that the poison would make her slightly
ill so that he could induce her to spend the night in his apartment
rather than to go home. His date drank the coffee and died as a
result.

(D) The defendant's daughter was suffering from a lingering, incurable,

483

fatal disease. One day, while the defendant was visiting her in the
hospital, she screamed and writhed in pain. Wanting to end her
suffering, the defendant placed a pillow over her face and held it
there until she died of suffocation.

65. A rare migratory bird is protected by international treaty. For this
reason, hunting of the bird is restricted to seasons fixed by a law
known as the Protection Act. Until recently, the Act permitted hunting
of the bird only during the months of March and April. The law was
changed last year, however, to permit bird hunting during the additional
months of May and June.

The defendant did not know that the law fixing the hunting season had
been changed. Because he did not like to compete with other hunters,
he planned to go bird hunting in May, believing that the season ended
in March. He invited his friend to join him, but the friend refused. The
friend, who was also unaware that the law had been changed,
informed a game warden about his conversation with the defendant.
The defendant went bird hunting on May 15. He shot at several birds
and missed before he succeeded in killing one of them. As soon as he
did, the game warden arrested the defendant. If the defendant is
charged with attempting to violate the Protection Act, which of the
following would be his most effective argument in defense?

(A) He actually succeeded in killing a bird prior to his arrest.

(B) The act that he intended to commit was not a crime.

(C) The friend was in pari delicto with the defendant because he was

unaware that the law had been changed.

(D) The attempted crime merged with the completed act.

66. The defendant had suspected for some time that his wife was unfaithful
to him. One night, when she came home later than usual, the defendant
confronted her, demanding to know where she had been. Tearfully, the
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
wife confessed that she had been out with a male friend and that she
had sexual intercourse with him. The defendant flew into a rage,
striking the wife repeatedly about the face and head with his clenched
fist. The following day, the wife died as a result of the injuries that the
defendant had inflicted. The defendant was subsequently charged with
murder. At the defendant's trial, his attorney asserted that, under the
circumstances, the defendant should not be convicted of any crime
more serious than voluntary manslaughter.

484

Which of the following would be the prosecuting attorney's most
effective argument in response to that assertion?

(A) The defendant's conduct indicated an intent to kill the wife.

(B) The defendant's conduct indicated an intent to inflict great bodily

harm on the wife.

(C) The defendant did not catch the wife in flagrante delicto.

(D) In the defendant's position, a person of ordinary temperament

would not have become angry enough to lose normal self-control.

67. Because of a series of early morning burglaries that had been

committed in a suburban neighborhood, police officers assigned to
patrol the area were instructed to stop and question all persons
traveling through the neighborhood between the hours of 2 A.M. and 5
A.M. One morning at 3:30 A.M., a police officer noticed the defendant
running along a street in the area. The officer pulled his patrol car
against the curb and ordered the defendant to stop. The defendant said,
“What for? Am I under arrest?”

The officer responded, “No. I just want to talk to you.” The officer got
out of the car and opened the back door, pointing his finger at the back
seat. When the defendant got into the back of the patrol car, the officer
said, “Now, I think you'd better tell me why you're running here at this
hour.”

The defendant said, “I guess you already know. I just broke into a
house around the corner.”

The officer arrested the defendant, who was subsequently charged
with burglary. At the trial, two witnesses testified that they saw the
defendant leaving the burglarized house shortly before his arrest. In
addition, the prosecution offered the testimony of the officer regarding
his conversation with the defendant in the back of the patrol car. The
defendant moved to exclude evidence of his statement.

Which of the following would be the prosecution's most effective
argument in response to the defendant's motion?

(A) Independent evidence tends to establish that the defendant did

commit the burglary with which he is charged.

485

(B) The defendant was not in custody at the time of the conversation.

(C) The defendant was not a suspect at the time of the conversation.

(D) The officer's questioning of the defendant was part of a routine

investigation.

68. The defendant was invited to a party at the home of the homeowner.
Because he wanted to help make the party a success, the defendant
purchased fireworks and brought them to the party. A state statute
requires that any person engaging in the use of fireworks have a license
and provides that the license may be issued only upon successful
completion of a safety course conducted by the fire department.
Although the defendant had never completed the safety course and had
no license to engage in the use of fireworks, he believed that he was
competent to do so without causing any danger. During the party, the
defendant set off some of the fireworks in the homeowner's backyard
with the homeowner's consent. Although the defendant acted
reasonably, one of them exploded prematurely, causing a fire that
completely destroyed the homeowner's home.

If the defendant is charged with arson, he should be found

(A) guilty, because he violated the statute requiring a license for the use

of fireworks.

(B) guilty, because the fire resulted from his conduct.

(C) not guilty, because the homeowner consented to the defendant's use

of the fireworks.

(D) not guilty, because the defendant did not intend damage to the

homeowner's home.

69. Because he was convicted of driving while intoxicated, the defendant's
driver's license was suspended. One day, he made a series of repairs
to the engine of his car. That night, after coming home from a party, the
defendant decided to test his car by driving it on a quiet residential
street on the outskirts of town. Traveling north toward an intersection,
he accelerated until he was driving at a speed of 100 miles per hour.
The victim, who was driving west, proceeded across the intersection
in violation of a red traffic signal light. The defendant saw the victim's
car, but because of the speed at which the defendant was traveling, was
unable to avoid striking it. The victim was killed in the collision. A
statute in the jurisdiction provides “No person shall operate a motor

486

vehicle on any public road or highway in this state unless such person
shall be the holder of a valid driving license. Violation of this section
shall be punishable by a maximum of 30 days in the county jail.”

If the defendant is convicted of the murder of the victim, it will most
likely be because

(A) driving while intoxicated is evidence of culpable negligence.

(B) his speed was evidence of a wanton disregard for human life.

(C) the jurisdiction applies the misdemeanor-manslaughter rule.

(D) the victim's death resulted from the defendant's unlicensed

operation of a motor vehicle.

70. When the owner of a hardware store went away on vacation, she left
her assistant in charge of the store. One day, while the assistant was
alone in the store, the defendant entered and pointed a realistic-looking
toy pistol at the assistant, demanding all the money in the cash register.
The assistant believed that the pistol in the defendant's hand was real
and complied with the defendant's demand because he was afraid that
if he did not, the defendant would shoot him.

The following day, the owner returned from her vacation. When the
assistant told her about the holdup, the owner became so upset that she
suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died.

The jurisdiction has a statute that provides that “Any person who
causes the death of another human being with the intent to cause such
death or in the course of committing a dangerous felony shall be guilty
of murder.” If the defendant is charged with the murder of the owner,
he should be found

(A) guilty, because robbery is a dangerous felony.

(B) guilty, because it was foreseeable that the robbery would result in

the death of the owner.

(C) not guilty, because the owner's death did not occur while the

defendant was committing a dangerous felony.

(D) not guilty, because the toy pistol that the defendant used could not

foreseeably have inflicted an injury upon another person.

71. Which of the following fact situations is the defendant's claim of

487

intoxication LEAST likely to be an effective defense?

(A) Charged with rape, the defendant asserts that immediately before
the act, he drank a great deal of liquor, and that as a result, he was
so intoxicated that he believed the victim to be his wife.

(B) Charged with murder, the defendant asserts that immediately before
she shot the victim, an unknown person put alcohol in her orange
juice without her knowledge, and that as a result she was so
intoxicated that she believed her gun to be a harmless toy.

(C) Charged with attempted robbery, the defendant asserts that at the

time she pointed her pistol at the victim and demanded money, she
was so intoxicated that she thought the victim was a friend of hers
and would know that she was joking.

(D) Charged with larceny of an automobile, the defendant asserts that
after injecting heroin into his bloodstream, he was so intoxicated
that he believed the automobile to be his own.

72. In which of the following fact situations is the defendant most likely to

be convicted of criminally receiving stolen property?

(A) After a woman was arrested for car theft, the district attorney

offered to let her plead guilty to a lesser offense in return for her
cooperation in the apprehension of the defendant. At the district
attorney's request, the woman offered to sell the defendant the car
that she had been caught stealing, telling the defendant that it was
stolen. The defendant agreed to purchase it for $300 and was
arrested as he handed the cash to the woman.

(B) A man told the defendant that the police were after him for stealing

a car, and that he wanted to get rid of the car as soon as possible.
When he offered to give the car to the defendant, the defendant
said, “Give it to my brother, but don't tell him it's stolen.” The man
gave the car to the defendant's brother without telling him that it
was stolen.

(C) An undercover police officer contacted the defendant saying, “Are

you interested in buying stolen cars?” The defendant said, “If the
price is right, I'll take all you can get.” Requisitioning a car from
the police department's property division, the officer showed it to
the defendant, telling him that the car was stolen. The defendant
agreed to purchase the car and was arrested as he handed cash to

488

the officer.

(D) Intending to make a fraudulent claim under his automobile theft

insurance policy, a man sold his car to the defendant, telling him
that the car was stolen. When the man was subsequently arrested
and charged with insurance fraud, he told the police about the
circumstances of his sale to the defendant, who was then charged
with receiving stolen property.

73. After observing the defendant for several weeks, police officers

concluded that he was engaged in the illegal sale of a dangerous drug.
Two officers obtained a warrant and searched the defendant's kitchen
while the defendant was present. Finding an ounce of the substance, the
officers arrested the defendant and advised him of his rights. While
driving to the police station, one officer said to the other, “I'll bet the
defendant has the rest of the drugs stashed somewhere. If some kids get
their hands on it, it could kill them. Then we'll have the SOB on a
murder rap.”

The defendant, who overheard the officer's statement from the back of
the police car, said, “Wait, I've got 10 pounds of the stuff hidden in the
tool shed behind my garage.” The officers returned to the defendant's
house and found the rest of the drugs in the tool shed. The defendant
was charged with violating a statute that made it a felony to possess
more than eight ounces of drug. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to
suppress the drugs found in his tool shed.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the
only one true, would provide the prosecution with its most effective
opposition to the defendant's motion?

(A) When he told the officers where to find the drugs, the defendant
fully understood his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.

(B) The officers were unaware that the defendant could overhear their

conversation from the back of the police car.

(C) The defendant's statement about the location of the drugs was

voluntary.

(D) The search of the defendant's kitchen and the arrest of the defendant

for possession of one ounce of drugs were lawful.

74. The defendant was employed as store manager by a retailer of tools

489

and equipment. One day, as part of her duties, the defendant was re-
arranging merchandise in the storeroom while examining store
inventory records. After moving a gasoline-powered lawnmower to a
position next to the rear door inside the storeroom, the defendant
discovered that the lawnmower was not listed in the inventory records.
Realizing that the lawnmower would therefore not be missed, the
defendant decided to steal it. She planned to take the mower out onto
the loading dock behind the store just before the store closed, and from
there to put the mower in her car after the store closed. Before
removing it from the storeroom, however, the defendant changed her
mind, leaving it where she had placed it and adding it to the store
inventory list.

Of which of the following crimes may the defendant be properly
convicted?

(A) Larceny only.

(B) Embezzlement only.

(C) Larceny and embezzlement.

(D) Neither larceny nor embezzlement.

75. The defendant and victim, both scientists working on a new laser gun
for the military, were drinking in a bar when they got into an argument
about the merits of their work. The two men got off their bar stools and
started shoving each other. The victim reached into his pocket and
started to take out his cellphone saying, “You know what? I've actually
got a laser gun to work and now you are dead!” The victim had an app
on his phone that made a sound like a laser charging up. The victim
turned on the sound while the cellphone was still in his pocket.
Because the defendant was intoxicated, he mistook the glow of the
cellphone screen and the noise as the charging of a real laser gun. He
grabbed a glass from the bar, shattered it, and then stabbed the victim.
The victim then bled to death. The defendant was charged with murder.
At trial, the defense showed that the defendant genuinely but
unreasonably believed that the victim was about to shoot him with a
laser gun. Consequently, the defendant claimed self-defense. In the
majority of states, if the court believes the defendant's claim regarding
the circumstances of the victim's death, the defendant's self-defense
claim will result in the defendant being found

(A) not guilty of any crime.

490

(B) guilty of murder.

(C) guilty of voluntary manslaughter.

(D) guilty of depraved heart murder.

76. The defendant was charged with first degree murder under a statute that
defines that crime as “the deliberate and premeditated unjustified
killing of a human being.” At his trial, the defendant offered the
testimony of a psychiatrist who attempted to testify that the defendant
had a violent temper and that, at the time of the killing, the defendant
was so enraged that he was not in control of his acts.

In a jurisdiction that has adopted only the M'Naghten test of insanity, is
the testimony of the psychiatrist admissible?

(A) Yes, because it tends to establish that the defendant was insane at

the time of his act.

(B) Yes, because it tends to establish that the killing was not

“deliberate and premeditated.”

(C) No, because it does not tend to establish insanity under the

M'Naghten rule.

(D) No, because in a prosecution for criminal homicide, provocation

should be measured by an objective standard.

77. A state police officer was investigating a series of car thefts. A federal
officer was assigned to assist under a federal statute that permits the
U.S. Department of Justice to aid local police departments in
investigating certain crimes. Because of the defendant's criminal
record, the state police officer went to the defendant's home and
questioned him regarding the recent thefts. During the course of the
questioning, the state police officer drew her gun and threatened to
shoot the defendant if the defendant did not immediately admit his guilt.
The defendant confessed to the thefts and identified his partner. The
state police officer left the defendant, saying, “I'll be back for you
later.” Then, after obtaining the necessary warrant, the state police
officer arrested the defendant's partner.

Unaware of the state police officer's activity, the federal officer
examined a stolen vehicle that had been recovered by the state police.
Using a U.S. Department of Justice computer, the federal officer

491

identified fingerprints as the defendant's. The federal officer obtained
the necessary warrant and arrested the defendant. The defendant's
partner and the defendant were charged in a state court with car theft.

The defendant moves to dismiss the prosecution on the ground that his
constitutional rights were violated by the state police officer. His
motion should be

(A) granted, because the state police officer failed to advise him of his

Miranda rights.

(B) granted, because the state police officer threatened to shoot him if

he did not confess to the crimes.

(C) denied, because the officers were employed by different

sovereigns.

(D) denied, because his arrest resulted from an independent

investigation by the federal officer.

78. The defendant's roommate heard of someone in a nearby town who
bought stolen cars. Because they needed money to pay their rent, the
roommate proposed to the defendant that they steal a car and sell it.
The defendant agreed, and the two of them went out immediately
looking for a car to steal. The roommate got behind the wheel of a car
they found and drove the car while the defendant sat beside him. Later,
the defendant climbed into the backseat and went to sleep.

While the defendant was sleeping, the roommate thought that he
noticed a police car following them. Hoping to avoid contact with the
police, he turned off onto a road that led into a neighboring state.
Shortly after crossing the state line, the roommate and the defendant
were arrested by federal police. They were subsequently charged in a
federal court with violating the Dyer Act, which makes the interstate
transportation of stolen vehicles a federal crime, and with conspiracy
to violate the Dyer Act.

On the charge of violating the Dyer Act, the defendant should be found

(A) not guilty, because he could not have anticipated that the roommate

would drive the car across the state line.

(B) not guilty, because he did not agree to transport the car across a

state line.

492

(C) not guilty, because transportation of the car across the state line
was not necessary to the success of the criminal enterprise.

(D) guilty.

79. The defendant, an attorney, was vice president of a corporation that

made children's pajamas. After several children were burned to death
while wearing the corporation's product, both the defendant and the
corporation were charged with criminal negligence. After placing the
defendant under arrest and informing her of the charge against her, the
arresting officer said, “Now your answers may be used against you, so
you don't have to give any, and you're entitled to an attorney.” The
defendant said, “I am an attorney,” and answered questions that the
officer then put to her regarding her corporate duties. At her trial, the
defendant moved to exclude evidence of her answers to those
questions, although she conceded that her statement was not coerced.

Read the summaries of the decisions in the four cases (A–D) below.
Which is most applicable as a precedent?

(A) After hearing gunshots, a police officer ran toward the sound.

Finding the victim lying dead in a pool of blood, the officer asked a
group of persons who were standing nearby what happened. The
defendant, who was among the bystanders, replied, “I shot the son
of a bitch.” At the defendant's murder trial, the court denied a
motion to exclude the officer's testimony regarding the defendant's
statement.

(B) A recently arrived immigrant from Southeast Asia was arrested for
burglary. After the arresting officer read him his Miranda rights,
she asked, “Do you understand what I just said?” The defendant
replied, “Yes. I break in the house for steal.” The defendant's
pretrial motion to exclude evidence of his confession was granted.

(C) Following a series of assaults, police officers went to the

defendant's home. The officers told the defendant that she was not
under arrest, but that they would appreciate her cooperation in
answering their questions. The defendant said, “I'm innocent, and
I'm willing to prove it by standing in a lineup.” She then
accompanied the police officers to the police station where two
assault victims picked her out of a lineup. At the defendant's trial
on a charge of assault, her motion to exclude evidence of the lineup
identification was denied.

493

(D) When the defendant was awakened at 3 A.M. by the sound of

knocking on his front door, he opened it to find three uniformed
police officers. One of them said, “We have reason to believe that
there is stolen property in your house. Do you mind if we search?”
The defendant let the officers in. During the course of their search,
they seized a stereo set that had been stolen from a local appliance
store. At his trial for criminally receiving stolen property, the
defendant's motion to suppress use of the stereo as evidence was
granted.

80. After a man was arrested for selling large quantities of illegal

substances, he agreed to assist the police in return for a promise that
the charges against him would be reduced. In furtherance of their
agreement, the police set the man up in the used car business and
spread the rumor that the man dealt in stolen vehicles. Subsequently, a
woman came to the man's lot offering to sell the man a stolen car. After
conferring with a police officer assigned to the investigation, the man
purchased the car from the woman. When he had done so, the police
arrested the woman and notified the car's owner that it had been
recovered. The following day, the defendant came to the man's lot and
said that he wished to purchase a stolen car. At the direction of an
undercover police officer, the man sold the defendant the car that he
had purchased from the woman.

If the defendant is charged with receiving stolen property, which of the
following would be his most effective argument in defense?

(A) The defendant was entrapped by an agent of the police.

(B) The car that the defendant purchased was not stolen property.

(C) The man's cooperation with the police was coerced.

(D) The police cannot bargain away a defendant's rights in an

agreement with a third person.

81. The defendant and his girlfriend had been living together and sharing a
bedroom for five months when they began arguing regularly. After one
such argument, the defendant stormed out of the apartment. Angry at
him, the girlfriend called the police to report that the defendant was in
possession of nearly a kilogram of marijuana. Two officers came to
talk to the girlfriend in the apartment. When they asked how she knew
that the defendant had that much marijuana, the girlfriend said, “I've
seen it. He keeps it in our closet. Would you like to look?” One of the

494

officers said that they would, and the girlfriend led them to the closet in
the bedroom that she shared with the defendant. When the girlfriend
opened the closet door, a plastic bag containing one and one-half
pounds of marijuana fell from the shelf. One of the officers took it.
Later, the defendant was arrested and charged with the unlawful
possession of a dangerous drug. If the defendant makes a timely motion
to suppress use of the marijuana as evidence, which of the following
would be the prosecution's most effective argument in opposition to his
motion?

(A) Their conversation with the girlfriend gave the police officers

probable cause to believe that there was marijuana in the closet.

(B) Failure to seize the marijuana immediately might have given the
defendant time to dispose of it before the police officers could
obtain a search warrant.

(C) The girlfriend invited the police officers to search the closet.

(D) The marijuana was in plain view when the closet door was opened.

82. The defendant was waiting for a bus on a street corner shortly after

midnight when three young men approached him and demanded that he
give them some money. Fearing that they would attack and injure him,
the defendant drew a pistol from his pocket. The three men began
running away, but the defendant shot each of them in the back, seriously
injuring two and killing the third. As a result, the defendant was
charged with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of murder.
By the time a grand jury was convened, the incident had received a
great deal of media attention, several newspapers referring to the
defendant as “The Vigilante Hero.” The defendant presented no
evidence to the grand jury, but after hearing the prosecution's evidence,
the grand jury refused to indict. Following the proceeding, the
prosecuting attorney stated that she believed that the grand jury's
decision resulted from publicity surrounding the incident, and that she
intended to bring the matter before another grand jury. Three weeks
later, a second grand jury issued an indictment against the defendant. If
the defendant moves to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it
violates his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United
States Constitution, his motion should be

(A) granted, because the first grand jury's failure to indict is res

judicata.

495

(B) granted, if the charges brought before the second grand jury were
identical to the charges brought before the first grand jury.

(C) denied, unless the decision of the first grand jury was motivated by

sympathy or undue prejudice.

(D) denied, because no trial has begun.

83. The defendant fired a pistol through the ceiling of her apartment

because the neighbors had refused several requests to stop making so
much noise at their party. She did not intend to hit anyone with the
bullet, but she hoped that the shot would frighten her neighbors and
chill the atmosphere. After passing through the floor of the apartment
above the defendant's, the bullet struck a piece of furniture and
ricocheted. It struck the victim, lodging in his shoulder and injuring
him.

An ambulance was called to transport the victim to a hospital for
treatment. Because the ambulance driver was driving negligently, the
ambulance was involved in a collision that resulted in the victim's
death. If the defendant is acquitted on a charge of murdering the victim,
it will most likely be because the court finds that

(A) the defendant did not intend to strike anyone with the bullet.

(B) the victim's death was proximately caused by the negligence of the

ambulance driver.

(C) the defendant was privileged to abate a nuisance by self-help.

(D) the defendant's conduct did not show a wanton disregard for human

life.

84. The victim and the defendant were roommates until they began arguing
bitterly. During one argument, the victim moved out of the apartment
that they shared. As she left, she said, “I'm going to get even with you
for all the grief you've caused me.” The following day, the defendant's
friend told the defendant that the victim had purchased a gun. The
friend also said that the victim told her that she was going to shoot the
defendant the next time she saw her. As a result, the defendant began
carrying a loaded pistol. Several days later, realizing that she still had
the key to the defendant's apartment, the victim went back to return it.
The defendant was leaving her apartment when she saw the victim
walking toward her. As the victim reached into her pocket for the
apartment key, the defendant drew her pistol and shot the victim,

496

aiming to hit her in the chest. The bullet grazed the victim's shoulder,
inflicting a minor injury. The victim immediately drew her own pistol
and shot the defendant with it, striking her in the thigh and inflicting a
serious injury.

If the defendant is charged with attempted murder, which of the
following would be her most effective argument in defense?

(A) The victim's injury was not serious enough to result in death.

(B) The defendant did not succeed in striking the victim in the chest as

she intended.

(C) It was reasonable for the defendant to believe that the victim was

reaching into her pocket for a gun.

(D) The force that the defendant used was not deadly.

85. Two men were members of a militant political group. As a protest

against the use of harmful agricultural chemicals, they planned to burn
down a factory that produced such chemicals. To be certain that no
persons would be injured in the explosion, they chose a time when they
knew that the factory was closed. At 10 P.M., they broke into the factory
and wired a fire bomb to a timer that was set to detonate at 11 P.M. At
10:45 P.M., they telephoned the local police and told them that the
factory would be bombed in 15 minutes, warning them to evacuate any
persons who might happen to be in the area. At 11 P.M., the bomb
detonated, causing flames that totally destroyed the factory. Two
transients who had broken into the factory at 10:30 P.M. in search of a
place to sleep were killed by the blast.

If the two men are charged with murder, they should be found

(A) not guilty, because they did not desire or know that their act would

result in the death of a human being.

(B) not guilty, because the deaths of the transients were totally
independent of their purpose in blowing up the factory.

(C) guilty, because it was not reasonable to believe that the police

could successfully evacuate the area in 15 minutes.

(D) guilty, because the deaths resulted from their commission of a

dangerous felony.

86. There were three employees and three customers in a bank when the

497

defendant entered and drew a pistol from his pocket. Waving the pistol
in the air, the defendant shouted, “Freeze! This is a holdup!”
Threatening to shoot him if he did not obey, the defendant ordered one
of the tellers to open the vault. After the teller had done so, the
defendant directed everyone present to lie down on the floor. The
defendant then removed all the cash from the vault and left the bank,
forcing one of the customers at gunpoint to accompany him into his car
as a hostage. After driving for about 15 minutes, the defendant opened
the car door and permitted the hostage to get out.

Of how many kidnappings may the defendant properly be convicted?

(A) Zero.

(B) One.

(C) Two.

(D) Six.

87. Undercover police officers received an anonymous tip that the

defendant was engaged in buying and selling stolen cars. They decided
to catch the defendant by pretending to be criminals. One of the officers
arranged to meet the defendant, telling the defendant that his friend was
looking for a buyer for stolen cars. When the defendant said that he
might be interested in purchasing one for resale, the officer offered to
put up half the money and to buy it with him as a partner. The defendant
agreed, and the officer gave him $1,000 in cash as his share. The
officer had requisitioned the money from the police department for that
purpose and had it marked in a way that would permit its subsequent
identification. The officer then introduced the defendant to the other
officer, saying that the other officer was a car thief. The other officer
offered to sell the defendant a car that he said he had stolen, but which
he had actually requisitioned from the police department for that
purpose. After agreeing on a price for the car, the defendant paid the
other officer with the marked money that the first officer had given him.
The officers immediately placed the defendant under arrest.

The defendant is charged with criminally receiving stolen property.
Which of the following would be his most effective argument in
defense against that charge?

(A) The car that the defendant purchased from the other officer had

been requisitioned from the police department.

498

(B) The money that the defendant used to purchase the car from the

other officer had been requisitioned from the police department.

(C) The two officers entrapped the defendant into purchasing the car.

(D) The anonymous tip received by the officers was not sufficient to

give them probable cause to believe 
that the defendant was guilty of a crime.

88. Four weeks after breaking her engagement with her boyfriend, the
defendant was angry because her boyfriend still had not returned a
stereo that he had borrowed from her. She went to his house one night
to demand its immediate return. When she got there, the boyfriend was
not at home and his door was unlocked. The defendant entered to look
for her stereo but could not find it. While searching, she noticed that
the boyfriend had a new couch. Thinking that the couch was worth as
much as her stereo, she tore open one of its cushions and set it on fire
before leaving. The fire destroyed the couch completely and charred
the walls and ceiling of the room, although the house itself was not
seriously damaged. The defendant was subsequently prosecuted.
Statutes in the jurisdiction adopt the common law definitions of
burglary, larceny, and arson.

If the defendant is charged with burglary and arson, she can properly
be convicted of

(A) burglary only.

(B) arson only.

(C) burglary and arson.

(D) neither burglary nor arson.

89. After being arrested and charged with bribery, the defendant spent one
night in a detention cell at the county jail. The informant, who had been
arrested on a charge unrelated to the defendant's case, was assigned to
the same detention cell as the defendant. Before putting the informant in
the cell, the police asked for his help. The following morning, the
defendant and the informant were released on bail. Leaving the jail
together, they stopped for breakfast and chatted about the charges
against them. During the course of their conversation, the defendant
told the informant that he was in fact guilty of bribery, and that he had
paid unlawful fees to several public officials. At the defendant's trial,
the informant was called as a prosecution witness. The informant

499

stated that he spoke to the defendant about the bribery case because the
police had offered to drop charges against him in return for help in
getting evidence against the defendant. The informant then attempted to
testify to the conversation in which the defendant admitted his guilt. If
the defendant's attorney objected and moved to exclude the testimony
on the ground that the defendant was not warned that anything he said to
the informant might be used against him, should the informant's
testimony regarding the defendant's admission of guilt be excluded on
that ground?

(A) Yes, because the police asked for the informant's help before

putting him in a cell with the defendant.

(B) Yes, because at the time of the informant's conversation with the
defendant, the informant was acting as an agent of the police.

(C) No, because the prosecution may not bargain away the rights of one

defendant in a deal with another.

(D) No, because the defendant was not in police custody when he

admitted his guilt to the informant.

90. As a result of mental illness, the defendant was obsessed with the

delusion that his wife, the victim, was building a bomb in the basement
of their house, and that she was going to use it to blow up the world.
Because he twice tried to kill the victim, he had been confined to a
state mental hospital on two occasions. After his most recent release
from confinement, the defendant discussed his belief with the police,
but they did not take him seriously. Although he knew that he would be
imprisoned for murder if he was caught, he pushed the victim down a
flight of stairs, thinking that he would save the world by killing her.
The victim died of injuries that she sustained in the fall.

If the defendant is prosecuted for the murder of the victim, his most
effective argument in defense would be that, as a result of mental
illness,

(A) he did not know that his act was wrong.

(B) he lacked criminal intent.

(C) he was unable to control his conduct.

(D) he did not appreciate the nature and quality of his act.

91. A teacher at a privately operated high school found an anonymous note

500

on his desk stating that the writer had heard through the grapevine that
the defendant, one of the teacher's students, was unlawfully selling
drugs to other students. The teacher immediately showed the note to the
school administrator, who ordered the defendant to report to her office.
When the defendant did so, the administrator reached into the
defendant's trouser pocket, where she found 23 capsules containing
drugs. The defendant was subsequently prosecuted for unlawful
possession of a controlled substance. In an appropriate proceeding, the
defendant moved to suppress evidence of the capsules found by the
administrator on the ground that she had violated his Fourth
Amendment rights by searching him.

Which of the following is the most effective argument in opposition to
the defendant's motion?

(A) The administrator was not working for the government.

(B) The special relationship between a high school administrator and a

student implies the student's consent to a search by the
administrator.

(C) Special concern for the well-being of young people justifies a

warrantless search of a student suspected of selling drugs to other
students.

(D) The administrator had probable cause to believe that the defendant

was in possession of dangerous drugs.

92. A teenager, who was 15 years of age, entered the sporting goods

department and asked the employee to sell her ammunition for a pistol.
The employee placed a box of ammunition on the counter and said,
“That'll be $9, please.” The employee usually worked in another
department. Realizing that she did not have any money with her, the
teenager left the store without the ammunition, saying that she would
return for it later. A statute in the jurisdiction provides as follows:
“Any person who sells ammunition for a firearm to a person below the
age of 16 years shall be guilty of a felony. The employer of any person
who violates this section during the course of such employment shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $250. It
shall not be a defense to a violation of this section that the defendant
had no knowledge of the age of the person to whom the sale was
made.”

501

The teenager did not return to the store. If the employee is charged
with attempting to violate the above statute, which of the following
would be the employee's most effective argument in defense against
that charge?

(A) The employee did not know of the statute or its provisions.

(B) The employee did not know that the teenager was below the age of

16 years.

(C) The owner should be prosecuted under the statute, since she was

the employee's employer.

(D) The employee is customarily employed in another department and
should not be held to the same standard as a person in the business
of selling firearms and ammunition.

93. The defendant and his ex-girlfriend had hated each other for years. One
day, the defendant waited outside his ex-girlfriend's office building
with a loaded pistol, planning to kill his ex-girlfriend. When the
defendant saw the victim leave the building, he believed the victim
was his ex-girlfriend and shot at her, aiming to kill her. The victim was
struck by the bullet and died of the bullet wound. If the defendant is
charged with the victim's murder in a jurisdiction that applies the
common law definition and the doctrine of transferred intent, the
defendant should be found

(A) guilty, because the jurisdiction applies the doctrine of transferred

intent.

(B) guilty, because the defendant intended to bring about the death of

the person at whom he shot.

(C) not guilty.

(D) guilty, because the defendant created an unreasonable risk that a

human being would die.

94. Federal agents arrested the defendant and others pursuant to a warrant
issued by a federal court. At the time of the arrest, federal officers
seized a quarter-ounce of heroin that was in the defendant's possession.
As a result, the defendant was convicted of violating a federal statute
that prohibits the possession of heroin with the intent to engage in
interstate distribution thereof. Following her conviction in the federal
court, federal officials offered to permit the state to use the seized
heroin as evidence in a state prosecution of the defendant. The

502

defendant was subsequently charged in a state court with conspiracy to
sell a controlled substance in violation of a state statute. If the
defendant moves to dismiss the state prosecution on the sole ground
that it violates her rights under the double jeopardy clause of the
United States Constitution, her motion should be

(A) granted, because the same evidence that was used to convict her in
the federal prosecution will be used to convict her in the state
prosecution.

(B) granted, because the crime of conspiracy is a lesser offense that

was constructively included in the federal prosecution.

(C) denied, because she is being charged in the state court with the

violation of a different statute than that which she was convicted of
violating in the federal court.

(D) granted, because a person may not be prosecuted by different

sovereigns for the same offense.

95. After the defendant entered a tavern and sat on a stool at the bar, a

friend sitting beside him said, “Did you ever have this special drink?”
The defendant ordered the special drink, although he had never heard
of it before. While he realized that the drink had some alcohol in it, he
was unaware that it was 90 percent alcohol. When the bartender
placed the drink in front of the defendant, the defendant drank it
quickly. A few moments later, the defendant fell off his bar stool
because he was overcome by the alcohol. He fell against an elderly
man, knocking him against the wall and causing the elderly man to
fracture several ribs. If the defendant is charged with committing a
criminal battery against the elderly man, which of the following
additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one true, would
provide the defendant with his most effective argument in defense?

(A) The defendant did not intend to become intoxicated by drinking the

drink.

(B) The defendant did not know that drinking the drink would cause him

to fall off the bar stool.

(C) The defendant did not intend to make contact with the elderly man.

(D) The defendant had never before been overcome by the alcohol in

one drink.

96. The defendant was the owner of a tavern. On two occasions in the

503

recent past, thieves entered the defendant's tavern after closing time
and stole several thousand dollars worth of liquor. In an attempt to
protect himself against further thefts, the defendant began sleeping in
the tavern at night with a loaded pistol by his side. One night, while on
his rounds, a police officer noticed that one of the defendant's windows
was open and climbed through the window to investigate. Hearing the
sound of someone moving about his tavern, the defendant stood up and
cocked his pistol. When the officer heard the sound and saw the outline
of a person standing by the bar with a pistol in his hand, the officer
shouted, “Drop that gun or I'll shoot!” The defendant and the officer
fired their pistols at each other. Each was struck by the other's bullet.

If the defendant is charged with attempted murder because of his
shooting of the officer, the court should find him

(A) not guilty, because the defendant reasonably believed that his life

was in danger.

(B) guilty, because deadly force is not permitted in defense of property.

(C) guilty, because the intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm can be

inferred from the defendant's conduct.

(D) guilty, because at the time of the shooting, the officer was a police

officer acting within the scope of his official duties.

97. The defendant and a bank robber had been in the same cell together

while serving time in prison. Soon after their release, the bank robber
asked the defendant to join him in robbing a bank. The defendant
refused, stating that he did not want to go back to prison. The bank
robber said he wouldn't use deadly force, then said that he would rob
the bank himself if the defendant would provide him with a place to
hide afterwards. The defendant agreed that the bank robber could hide
in the defendant's apartment following the robbery in return for one-
fourth of the proceeds of the robbery. The following day, the bank
robber robbed the bank. While he was attempting to leave the bank, a
security guard began shooting at him, and the bank robber fired back,
killing a bystander. One week later, the bank robber was arrested at the
defendant's apartment, where he had been hiding, and was charged
with robbery and felony murder.

The defendant was subsequently charged with felony murder on the
ground that he was an accomplice to the robbery committed by the

504

bank robber that resulted in the death of a bystander. The court should
find the defendant

(A) not guilty, because he was an accessory after the fact.

(B) not guilty, because he did not know that the bank robber was going

to use deadly force to accomplish the robbery.

(C) guilty, only if it was foreseeable that someone would be shot during

the course of the robbery.

(D) guilty, because an accomplice is responsible for all crimes

committed in furtherance of the crime to which he or she is an
accomplice.

98. After being advised by an informant that the defendant was growing

marijuana in a large field, two police officers flew over the field in an
airplane and observed marijuana growing there. Because of
particularly dense cloud formations, it was necessary for them to use
special equipment to photograph the field. The following day, the
officers drove to the field and looked through the barbed wire fence
that surrounded it. Although nothing was growing in the field, they
observed that something had recently been harvested. They also
observed a series of footprints leading to a barn located in the field.
After obtaining a search warrant, the officers entered the field and
searched the barn, where they found two suitcases containing
marijuana. The defendant was later arrested.

The defendant's attorney made an appropriate motion to exclude the
marijuana contained in the suitcases. Should the evidence be
excluded?

(A) Yes, because the police used special equipment to photograph the

field.

(B) No, because the reliability of the informant can be established.

(C) Yes, because it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that

nobody would look into his field.

(D) No, because the officers had a warrant to search the barn.

99. A statute prohibited the sale of liquor between the hours of midnight

and 8 A.M. When a customer came into the defendant's liquor store and
asked to buy a bottle of liquor, the defendant looked at the clock and
saw that it said five minutes past eleven, so he sold the liquor to the

505

customer. The defendant believed that the clock was correct and did
not realize that the previous day the state had changed from standard
time to daylight saving time. In fact, the correct time was five minutes
past midnight.

If the defendant is charged with attempting to violate the statute, he
should be found

(A) guilty, because he sold liquor between midnight and 8 A.M.

(B) guilty, because he should have known the actual time.

(C) guilty, because the statute did not require specific intent.

(D) not guilty, because he believed that the time was five minutes past

eleven.

100. The victim borrowed $50 and a watch worth an additional $50 from

the defendant. Although the defendant repeatedly requested that the
victim return the watch and the money, the victim refused to do so. The
defendant and the victim belonged to the same exercise club. One day,
while the victim was in the shower, the defendant opened the victim's
locker and took $100 from the victim's wallet, returning the wallet to
the locker. It was the defendant's intention to keep $50 of the money to
pay himself back for the money he had loaned the victim and to keep
the other $50 to pay himself for the watch that the victim had refused to
return. A statute in the jurisdiction adopts the common law definition
of larceny and provides that a larceny of $50 or less is a misdemeanor,
while a larceny of more than $50 is a felony. The defendant is guilty of

(A) one misdemeanor only.

(B) two misdemeanors only.

(C) a felony.

(D) no crime.

101. Because he wanted to run away with his mistress, a man decided to

murder his wife by poisoning her. He slipped a lethal dose of poison
into her morning coffee and went to work. When the wife came down
to the kitchen and drank it, she immediately fell facedown on the
counter. A few minutes later, the mistress came to the kitchen backdoor
and saw the wife facedown on the counter. The mistress thought the
wife was sleeping, but the wife was really about two hours away from
death by the poison. Believing this was her chance to kill the wife, the

506

mistress broke into the house and stabbed the wife in the back with a
cleaver. The wound would not have killed the wife except for the fact
that she was weakened by the poison. She died 10 minutes later,
although she would have lasted a few more hours if she hadn't been
stabbed.

May the mistress be held criminally liable for the murder?

(A) Yes, because the stabbing sped up the wife's death.

(B) Yes, because the mistress had unlawfully entered the house.

(C) No, because the wife would have died anyway based on the poison.

(D) No, because the stabbing could not have killed the wife on its own.

102. The defendant and two other men met while in prison and decided that

when they were released, they would rob a bank together. Soon after
their release, they planned the robbery, agreeing that the defendant
would steal and drive the getaway car and that the two other men
would commit the actual robbery. The defendant stole a car for the
robbery and brought it to one of the men's house, but the day before the
robbery was to be committed, the defendant was arrested for violating
the conditions of his parole and was returned to prison. The following
day, the two other men went ahead with the plan, entering the bank and
threatening to shoot the cashiers if they did not hand over all available
cash. A teller pushed a button that alerted the police, and the two men
were arrested before leaving the bank.

Of which of the following crimes is the defendant guilty?

(A) Attempted robbery.

(B) Conspiracy to commit robbery.

(C) Attempted robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.

(D) No crime.

103. The public prosecutor had information that unlawful gambling

activities were being conducted at a tavern. She obtained a warrant for
the search by presenting an affidavit that stated that she had received
information regarding the illegal activities from an informant who had
observed the reported activities while present at the tavern. The
affidavit stated that the informant frequently gave information to the
police and prosecutor and that the information received from the

507

informant in the past had always been found to be accurate. It did not
give the name of the informant, however, because it stated that his
anonymity needed to be preserved both for his own protection and to
continue his effectiveness as an informant. The warrant was issued.

Upon searching the premises, the police found gambling records in a
cash drawer located behind the bar. In addition, the defendant, who
was in the tavern, was searched and found to be in possession of
unlawful gambling records.

The warrant was properly issued and executed with respect to the
tavern. The defendant was charged with gambling, and he moved to
suppress the use of gambling records found on his person. The court
should

(A) grant the motion, because the court that issued the warrant did not
have probable cause to believe that any customers in the tavern
were engaging in unlawful gambling activities.

(B) grant the motion, because the warrant did not properly identify the

persons to be searched.

(C) deny the motion, because a warrant that authorizes a search of

premises may also authorize the search of persons present on those
premises.

(D) deny the motion, because the fact that the defendant was found to be
in possession of unlawful gambling records corroborated the
information contained in the affidavit that the public prosecutor
submitted in support of the application for the warrant.

104. The defendant met a girl in a bar where both were drinking. Because

the defendant was too drunk to drive, the girl offered him a ride home.
In the girl's car, the girl consented to intercourse. A statute provided
that it was unlawful to engage in sexual intercourse with a female
under the age of 18 years, and the girl was 17 years old. If the
defendant believed that the girl was over the age of 18 years, is he
guilty of statutory rape?

(A) No, because he believed the girl to be over the age of 18 years.

(B) No, if the reasonable person who was not intoxicated would have

believed the girl to be over the age of 18 years.

(C) Yes, unless the girl assured him that she was over the age of 18

508

years.

(D) Yes, but only if the defendant realized that he was having

intercourse.

105. Three friends were hanging out while their parents were not home. The
first boy was 17 years of age; the girl and the second boy were each
15. Since the girl had engaged in sexual relations with several other
boys at the high school, she and the first boy secretly agreed that she
would try to seduce the second boy. The girl had some marijuana in
her purse, and she and the second boy smoked some of it. Soon,
however, the second boy's intoxication made him physically unable to
perform. A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “A person is guilty
of rape in the third degree when, being 17 years of age or more, he or
she engages in sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16
years.”

Laws in the state define a conspiracy as “An agreement to commit a
crime between two or more persons with the specific intent to commit
a crime.” If the first boy is charged with conspiracy based on his
agreement with the girl regarding the seduction of the second boy, the
first boy's most effective argument in defense would be that

(A) the seduction of the second boy would not have been possible

without the girl's participation.

(B) the first boy did not commit any overt act that was likely to

accomplish the seduction of the second boy.

(C) the girl was unsuccessful in having intercourse with the second boy.

(D) intercourse between the girl and the second boy would not have

been a crime.

106. A store owner wanted to erect a new storage building so that he could

expand his business of selling diet food and health supplies. He was
afraid, however, that the building department would not issue him a
permit to begin construction. A building department clerk said that she
would make a false entry in the official records to indicate that a
permit had already been issued if the store owner would pay her $500.
The store owner agreed and said that he would bring the money the
following day. The next day, however, when the store owner went to
the clerk's office with $500, he was told that she had been fired.

509

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “Any person who shall give
or accept a fee not authorized by law as consideration for the act of
any public employee is guilty of bribery, a felony. Any person who
shall offer to commit a bribery is guilty of bribery in the second
degree, a felony.”

If the defendant is prosecuted for attempted bribery in the second
degree, the court should find him

(A) not guilty, because bribery in the second degree is an attempt crime,

and there can be no liability for attempting to attempt.

(B) not guilty, because it was the clerk who made the initial offer.

(C) not guilty, because the defendant committed bribery in the second

degree when he agreed to pay the clerk for altering the records, and
the attempt merged with that crime.

(D) guilty, because attempting to commit bribery in the second degree is

a lesser offense included in that crime.

107. Angry because her coworker had insulted her, the defendant decided to
get revenge. Because she worked for an exterminator, the defendant
had access to cans of a poison gas that was often used to kill termites
and other insects. She did not want to kill the coworker, so she
carefully read the user manual supplied by the manufacturer. The
manual said that the gas was not fatal to human beings, but that
exposure to it could cause serious ailments, including blindness and
permanent respiratory irritation. When she was sure that no one would
see her, the defendant brought a can of the gas to the parking lot and
released the poison gas into the coworker's car. At lunchtime, the
coworker and his friend sat together in the coworker's car. As a result
of their exposure to the gas in the car, the friend died and the coworker
became so ill that he was hospitalized for over a month.

If the defendant is charged with the attempted murder of the coworker,
she should be found

(A) guilty, because the coworker suffered a serious illness as the result
of a criminal act that she performed with intent to cause him great
bodily harm.

(B) guilty, because her intent to cause great bodily harm resulted in the

death of the friend.

510

(C) not guilty, because she did not intend to cause the death of any

person.

(D) not guilty, because the crime of attempted murder merges with the

crime of murder.

108. The defendant had been arraigned on a charge of burglarizing the home
of the victim. He was assigned a public defender and pleaded not
guilty, but because he was unable to post bail, he was in jail awaiting
trial. After the police received a warrant to do so, they had an
undercover police officer placed in the same cell as the defendant. The
officer was instructed not to question the defendant about the charge
against him.

While walking through the corridor of the jail, the defendant told the
officer that he had committed the burglary with which he was charged.
At trial, the officer testified to the conversation that he had with the
defendant in which the defendant admitted his guilt.

If the defendant's attorney objects to the testimony of the officer
regarding the statement that the defendant made to him in the corridor,
the objection should be

(A) sustained, because the statement was made to a police officer in the
absence of and without the consent of the defendant's attorney.

(B) sustained, because the officer entrapped the defendant into making

the statement.

(C) overruled, because the officer was placed in the defendant's cell

pursuant to a warrant.

(D) overruled, because the defendant made the statement voluntarily.

109. Two boys decided to kill another boy that they did not like. To do so,
they planned to steal the victim's asthma medication. As the two boys
were walking toward the victim's room, one of the boys decided not to
go through with the plan. Because he was afraid that the other boy
would make fun of him for chickening out, he said nothing to him about
his change of mind. Instead, saying that he needed to use the bathroom,
he ran away. The other boy then went into the victim's room by
himself, found the medicine, and threw the medicine away. Later that
night, the victim had an asthma attack and died because he was unable
to find his medicine.

511

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that persons the age of the two
boys are adults for the purposes of criminal liability.

If the boy who ran away is charged with the murder of the victim, a
court will probably find him

(A) guilty, because he and the other boy agreed to throw away the
victim's medicine in the hope that doing so would cause the
victim's death.

(B) guilty, because he aided and abetted in causing the victim's death.

(C) not guilty, because he did not physically participate in throwing

away the victim's medicine.

(D) not guilty, because he withdrew from the conspiracy before any

overt act was committed.

110. A man had just been released from prison after serving a three-year

term for aggravated assault. In need of money, he called his old friend,
the defendant, and asked whether the defendant would be interested in
joining the man in the robbery of a pawnshop. The defendant agreed,
but only after making the man promise that there would be no violence.
Upon the defendant's insistence, they carried realistic-looking toy guns.
When they entered the pawnshop, they drew their toy guns and ordered
the pawnshop owner to give them all the money in his cash register and
all the gems in his safe. The pawnshop owner took a gun from the safe
and shot the man, killing him. The pawnshop owner then aimed the
pistol at the defendant, who fled from the store. As the pawnshop
owner ran out into the street with his pistol in his hand, the defendant
jumped into the car that he and the man had left parked at the curb.
Speeding away from the scene without looking or caring where he was
going, the defendant accidentally struck a pedestrian, who died of her
injuries. By statute, the jurisdiction adopted the felony-murder rule.

If the defendant is charged with the murder of the pedestrian, the court
should find him

(A) guilty, because the pedestrian's death resulted from the defendant's

attempt to commit a robbery.

(B) guilty, because he drove the car in a criminally negligent manner.

(C) not guilty, because he was in reasonable fear for his own life when

attempting to flee in the automobile.

512

(D) not guilty, because the pedestrian's death did not occur during the

commission of a felony.

111. A nine-year-old girl fell into a public pool, striking her head against its
edge. Her aunt saw the girl fall and realized that the child would
drown if someone did not rescue her. The aunt knew that there was no
lifeguard present, and that no one else had seen the girl fall, but she
made no effort to rescue the girl although the aunt was a strong
swimmer and could easily have done so with no risk to herself. The
girl drowned.

If the aunt is charged with criminal homicide in the death of the girl,
the court should find her

(A) guilty, because she could have saved the girl without any risk to

herself.

(B) guilty, because she knew that she was the only person present who
was aware of the girl's plight and who was able to rescue her.

(C) guilty, because she was related to the girl.

(D) not guilty, because she had no duty to aid the girl.

After a man raped the defendant in her apartment, he fell asleep. The
defendant tied his hands and feet to the four corners of the bed and
woke him. She said, “Now you are going to be punished for what you
have done. I should kill you, but I won't because I want to make sure
that you 
suffer for the rest of your life.” Using 
the man's own knife, she began to cut and jab him with it, planning to
torture but 
not to kill him. She stabbed and blinded him in both eyes, then cut off
his sex organs. She also severed the tip of his nose and made a series
of cuts across his face and chest.

112. The man died as a result of the injuries inflicted by the defendant. She

was charged with first degree murder in a jurisdiction 
that defines that crime as “the unlawful killing of a human being
committed intentionally, with deliberation and premeditation.” The
court should find the defendant

(A) not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to cause the man's

death.

513

(B) not guilty, because the defendant was acting in self-defense.

(C) guilty, because the man's death resulted from the defendant's

commission of a dangerous felony.

(D) guilty, because the man's death resulted from torture.

113. The defendant noticed a gold-plated pen on her professor's desk and

put it into her pocket. She did so with the intention of returning the pen
in a week or two. The following day, however, the pen was stolen
from the defendant's briefcase. The jurisdiction applies the common
law definitions of larceny and burglary.

If the defendant is charged with larceny as a result of her taking the
gold-plated pen, she should be

(A) acquitted, because theft of the pen from her briefcase was a

superseding cause.

(B) acquitted, because she intended to return the pen in a week or two.

(C) convicted, because the professor was permanently deprived of the

pen.

(D) convicted, because theft of the pen from her briefcase was

foreseeable.

114. Between flights, a woman set her briefcase down beside her seat in the
airport waiting room. The defendant saw this and walked past her in a
casual fashion, picking up the briefcase and walking off with it as he
went by. The woman, believing that he had taken it by mistake, ran to
him and said, “Pardon me, sir. You've taken my bag.” The defendant
drew a realistic-looking toy pistol, pushed her into a seat, and ran
away. The defendant was charged with robbery.

Read the summaries of the decisions in the four cases (A–D) below.
Then decide which is most applicable as a precedent to this case.

(A) The victim was walking on a crowded street with her purse

hanging from a strap over her shoulder when the defendant yanked
the purse with sufficient force to break the strap. The defendant
then ran off with it into the crowd. The defendant's conviction for
robbery was reversed.

(B) The defendant took a package of meat from a showcase in a

supermarket and slipped it under his shirt. He left the store without

514

paying for it. The store cashier ran after him into the parking lot
and stepped in front of him, blocking his path. The defendant took a
straight razor from his pocket and grabbed another customer. He
held the razor to the customer's throat, telling the store cashier to
get out of the way. The cashier stepped aside, and the defendant ran
away, releasing the other customer. The defendant's conviction for
robbery was affirmed.

(C) A schoolteacher took her sixth grade class to visit a display of
medieval torture devices at the museum. She sat in a wooden
torture chair and had herself shackled into it to demonstrate its
operation to her students. The defendant, who worked at the
museum, surreptitiously photographed her with an instant camera.
He then went to the office of the teacher's husband and showed the
husband the photograph of the teacher in the torture chair. The
defendant said that his confederates would torture her unless he
called them on the phone and told them that the husband had given
him $500. The husband gave him the money. The defendant's
conviction for robbery was reversed.

(D) When the victim purchased a ticket at the airport for his flight, he
checked his baggage. Later, the defendant, wearing a mask and
carrying a gun, entered the room where checked baggage was
stored. While forcing the room attendant to lie face down on the
floor, the defendant opened the victim's suitcase and removed
several hundred dollars worth of negotiable securities. The
defendant's conviction for robbery was affirmed.

115. A supermarket cashier borrowed money from the company safe to get

through the weekend, then returned it on Monday morning after she was
paid. One of her coworkers saw her returning the money and
questioned her about it until the cashier admitted what she had done.
The coworker stopped her before she closed the safe and said that
unless the cashier gave him $25 of the store's money, he would tell the
boss. The cashier knew that she could get away with taking $25
because the store records were frequently off by that much and the
boss never worried about it. Thus, she took out $25 from the safe and
gave it to the coworker.

Of which one of the following crimes is the coworker most likely to
be guilty as a result of his conduct on Monday morning?

515

(A) Robbery, because he obtained money from the cashier by threat and

intimidation.

(B) Larceny, because he obtained money by inciting and encouraging

the cashier to steal $25 from the safe.

(C) Embezzlement, because he obtained his employer's money by

violating his duty to report the cashier's conduct.

(D) Fraud, because he obtained money by withholding information that

he had a duty to disclose.

116. A statute provides as follows: “Any person who knowingly sells an
intoxicating substance to a person under the age of 21 years shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor.” The owner of a cocktail lounge hired a new
bartender. Before the bartender began working, the owner read him the
above statute and explained the need for him to check the identification
of all persons who appeared to be under the age of 21 years. She also
told him that if she ever heard of his violating the statute, she would
fire him immediately. Later that night, a 17-year-old teenager who
looked like he was 25 ordered a glass of wine. The teenager showed
the bartender an altered driver's license that falsely stated his age to be
22. The bartender was not sure whether the phrase intoxicating
substance in the statute included wine, and he served it to the teenager.
An undercover police officer who was at the bar observed the
transaction. He then showed his badge, demanding to see the teenager's
identification. Recognizing the driver's license as a forgery, he
arrested the bartender.

The owner is charged with violating the statute, and the prosecutor
asserts that she should be held vicariously liable for the bartender's
act. Which of the following would be the owner's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) The owner did not have personal knowledge of the sale to the

teenager.

(B) The owner cautioned the bartender against violation of the statute.

(C) The bartender is not guilty of violating the statute.

(D) The bartender was not acting within the scope of his employment

when he sold wine to a minor in violation of the statute.

117. The defendant was an avid deer hunter. His favorite place to hunt was

516

a small cemetery in the middle of a densely populated suburban
neighborhood. Because the neighborhood had grown so quickly within
the past decade, deer were forced to congregate in a few wooded
patches in the cemetery, making the likelihood of seeing a deer
extremely high. One morning when the defendant was in the cemetery,
he saw a deer standing near the cemetery gates about 80 yards away.
The defendant shot at the deer. The bullet missed and went through the
front window of a nearby house, killing the victim. What is the most
serious crime for which the defendant can be convicted?

(A) Battery.

(B) Involuntary manslaughter.

(C) Voluntary manslaughter.

(D) Murder.

118. In the course of robbing a bank, the defendant pointed a gun at three
bank tellers and the bank manager and ordered them to go from the
bank lobby to the back room while his confederate attempted to open
the safe.

If the defendant is charged with kidnapping the bank manager, his most
effective argument in defense would be that

(A) he did not demand a ransom.

(B) he released the bank manager as soon as the robbery was

completed.

(C) ordering the bank manager to go from the bank lobby to the back
room was incidental and necessary to the commission of the
robbery.

(D) the bank manager was an adult.

119. The police believed the defendant was engaged in drug dealing, so

they obtained a warrant to search her home. When they arrived, a man
was working in the front yard. He told the officers that he was the
defendant's ex-husband and that she had moved out. He led the officers
inside and took them to a back bedroom where he said the defendant
had “left some of her stuff.” The officers searched the back bedroom
and found several shoeboxes of marijuana. The man then told the
officers the defendant had moved to another house down the street. He
said the defendant was still at work, but would be home soon, so they

517

should hurry and search the house before the defendant destroyed the
evidence. The officers went down the street and found the front door
unlocked. They then searched the house, and discovered a large
marijuana grow operation.

At trial, the defendant argued that the search that uncovered the
marijuana grow operation was unlawful. How should the court rule?

(A) The search was lawful based on exigent circumstances.

(B) The search was lawful based on consent.

(C) The search was unlawful because the officers did not have a

warrant.

(D) The search was unlawful based on the fruit of the poisonous tree.

120. Because they were bigots, two men were angry when a Chinese family
moved into a house on their street. Deciding to drive them away and to
set an example that would discourage other Chinese people from
moving into the neighborhood, they agreed to set fire to the family's
home. They went to the house, and one of the men started pouring
gasoline around it. A crowd of onlookers began to gather. The
defendant, one of the onlookers, hoped that the men would burn down
the house but said nothing. After the first man finished pouring the
gasoline, the second man lit a match and set it afire, burning the house
to the ground.

On a charge of arson, the defendant is

(A) guilty, because she made no attempt to stop the crime from being

committed.

(B) guilty, because her hope that the men would burn the house down

amounted to criminal intent.

(C) not guilty, because mere presence coupled with silent approval is

not sufficient to result in liability as an accessory.

(D) not guilty, because she was, at most, an accessory after the fact.

121. A landlord was the owner of a three-unit residential building. She

lived in an apartment on the third floor; her son, the defendant, lived
with his wife in an apartment on the second floor; and the ground floor
apartment was rented to a police officer and his family. One day, while
the defendant and his wife were out of town, the landlord and the

518

officer were having coffee together in the landlord's apartment. During
the course of their conversation, the landlord said that she was
worried about the defendant because once, while visiting him, she saw
a substance in his apartment that she believed to be cocaine. Since she
really did not know what cocaine looked like, however, she was not
sure. The officer said, “If you'd like, I'll have a look and let you know
whether or not there is anything for you to worry about.”

Using her key to open the door to the defendant's apartment, the
landlord brought the officer inside. Lying on a table in the entrance
hall inside the apartment was a plastic pouch containing white
powder. The officer sniffed it and said, “That's coke, all right,” putting
it in his pocket. Then he noticed a television in the living room that
looked like one stolen from an appliance store in the neighborhood.
Without saying anything about the television to the landlord, the officer
obtained a search warrant by submitting an affidavit indicating that he
had seen certain items in the defendant's apartment that he had
probable cause to believe were stolen. Later, he returned, entered, and
thoroughly searched the apartment pursuant to the warrant. The
television that he had seen on his first visit was not stolen, but during
the course of his search, he found several items that were stolen.
Eventually, the defendant was charged with burglary.

On the charge of burglary, if the defendant makes an appropriate
motion to suppress the use of stolen items found in his apartment, his
motion should be

(A) denied, since the stolen items were obtained as the result of a

lawful search.

(B) denied, since it would not serve the interests of justice to require a
police officer to ignore a discovery that he or she has probable
cause to believe is contraband.

(C) granted, because the search warrant was issued as the result of

information obtained in an unlawful search.

(D) granted, since his possession of stolen items is not necessarily

proof that he stole those items.

122. A woman was a collector of antique automobiles. One day, she took
her infant daughter for a ride in one of the most valuable cars in her
collection. On her way, she stopped to buy a newspaper. Because her

519

daughter had fallen asleep in the backseat, the collector left her in the
car when she got out. The defendant, a professional car thief who
happened to be at the newspaper stand, jumped into the collector's car
and drove it away without noticing the daughter in the backseat.

The defendant realized that he would not be able to sell a stolen car as
unusual as this one, so he parked it in a friend's garage, still unaware
of the presence of the sleeping child. Getting the collector's name and
phone number from some papers in the glove compartment of the car,
the defendant phoned her and left a message on her telephone
answering machine, telling her that if she did not immediately bring
$1,000 in cash to a certain location, he would set the car on fire.

When the collector realized that her car, with her daughter in the
backseat, was gone, she became frantic and rushed home. When she
picked up her phone to call the police, her answering machine played
the defendant's message. Upon hearing it, the collector brought $1,000
to the location specified. The defendant, who was waiting for her, took
the money and returned the car. The daughter was still sleeping quietly
in the backseat.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the
only one true, would be most likely to lead to a conviction of the
defendant on a charge of robbery of $1,000 from the collector?

(A) The car was in the collector's possession when the defendant took

it.

(B) The collector paid the money to prevent injury to her daughter.

(C) The collector paid the money to prevent damage to her automobile.

(D) By the time the collector showed up with the money, the defendant

had discovered the daughter sleeping in the backseat.

123. A state police officer was investigating a series of car thefts. A federal
officer was assigned to assist under a federal statute that permits the
United States Department of Justice to aid local police departments in
investigating certain crimes. Because of a man's criminal record, the
state officer went to the man's home and questioned him regarding the
recent thefts. She did not inform the federal officer that she was going
to do so. During the course of the questioning, the state officer drew
her gun and threatened to shoot the man if the man did not immediately

520

admit his guilt. The man confessed to the thefts and identified the
defendant as his partner. The state officer left the man, saying, “I'll be
back for you later.” Then, after obtaining the necessary warrant, the
state officer arrested the defendant.

Unaware of the state officer's activity, the federal officer examined a
stolen vehicle that had been recovered by the state police. The federal
officer found fingerprints in locations that indicated that they were
made by a person breaking into and starting the car. Using a U.S.
Department of Justice computer, the federal officer identified the
fingerprints as the man's. The federal officer obtained the necessary
warrant and arrested the man. The man and the defendant were
charged in a state court with car theft.

The defendant moved to dismiss the prosecution against him on the
ground that his identification was obtained during the course of an
unlawful interrogation of the man. Which of the following would be
the prosecution's most effective argument in opposition to the
defendant's motion?

(A) The discovery of the defendant's identity was inevitable.

(B) The discovery of the defendant's identity was the result of an

independent investigation that purged any taint resulting from the
illegality of the interrogation of the man.

(C) The interrogation of the man did not violate the defendant's

constitutional rights.

(D) The defendant was not in custody at the time of the man's

interrogation.

124. The defendant placed a large wager on a football game that he had to

win or he was going to have his home foreclosed on. He decided to
watch it at a local bar. During the very close game, the defendant was
so nervous that he drank several beers and became drunk. At the last
minute, the team he bet on scored a touchdown and won the game. The
defendant cheered. He then noticed two big men sitting at the other end
of the bar who worked for the bookie he had placed the bet with.
Fearing the men were going to hurt him because of his win, the
defendant got in his car and drove home. A police officer saw him
driving erratically and tried to pull him over. A reasonable sober
driver would have recognized the car as a police car, but the defendant

521

thought it was the bookie's employees coming to kill him. The
defendant made a quick turn onto a busy side street. A pedestrian was
crossing the street with his headphones on and without looking. The
defendant hit him with the car, and the pedestrian died immediately.
The defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter. The
defendant should be found

(A) not guilty, because the pedestrian was contributorily negligent in
crossing the busy street without looking and with his headphones
on.

(B) not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to cause the

pedestrian's death.

(C) not guilty, because the defendant genuinely believed he was fleeing

for his life.

(D) guilty.

125. The defendant and his friend decided to rob a woman at an ATM.

When the woman withdrew her money, the defendant hit her with a
brick and his friend grabbed her purse. As the two men were fleeing
the scene, a police officer yelled for them to stop. When they did not
do so, he shot them both. The defendant's friend later died from his
injuries.

If the defendant is put on trial for felony murder, how should the court
rule?

(A) Guilty, because his friend died during the commission of a felony.

(B) Guilty, because his friend died during the commission of a

dangerous felony.

(C) Not guilty, because his friend was killed by a police officer.

(D) Not guilty, because the felony was completed when his friend was

shot.

126. The defendant, who was a law student, was attempting to study for her
final examinations. She was having difficulty concentrating because the
people in the apartment above hers were having a loud party, and the
defendant found the noise distracting. She telephoned, asking her
neighbors to stop making so much noise, but they refused to do so.
Finally, the defendant fired a pistol through the ceiling of her
apartment. She did not intend to hit anyone with the bullet but hoped

522

that the shot would frighten her neighbors and chill the atmosphere.
After passing through the floor of the apartment above the defendant's,
the bullet struck a piece of furniture and ricocheted. It struck the
victim, lodging in his shoulder and injuring him.

Which of the following is the most serious crime of which the
defendant may be properly convicted?

(A) Battery.

(B) Attempted involuntary manslaughter.

(C) Attempted voluntary manslaughter.

(D) Attempted murder.

127. The defendant and her friend were roommates until they began arguing

bitterly. During one argument, the defendant moved out of the
apartment that they shared. As she left, she said, “I'm going to get even
with you for all the grief you've caused me.” The following day, a
neighbor told the friend that the defendant had purchased a gun. The
neighbor also said that the defendant told her that she was going to
shoot the friend the next time she saw her. As a result, the friend began
carrying a loaded pistol. Several days later, realizing that she still had
the key to the apartment, the defendant went back to return it. The
friend was leaving the apartment when she saw the defendant walking
toward her. As the defendant reached into her pocket for the apartment
key, the friend drew her pistol and shot the defendant, aiming to hit her
in the chest. The bullet grazed the defendant's shoulder, inflicting a
minor injury. The defendant immediately drew her own pistol and shot
the friend with it, striking her in the thigh and inflicting a serious
injury.

The defendant is charged with attempted murder. If the defendant
asserts the privilege of self-defense, she will most probably be found

(A) guilty, because it was reasonable for the friend to believe that the

defendant was reaching into her pocket for a gun.

(B) guilty, because the defendant's injury was not serious enough to

result in death.

(C) guilty, because the fact that the defendant was carrying a pistol is

evidence of premeditation.

523

(D) not guilty.

128. Two men were members of a militant political group. As a protest

against the use of harmful agricultural chemicals, they planned to burn
down a factory that produced such chemicals. A few days later, they
set off a bomb that burned the factory to the ground.

The jurisdiction has a statute that extends the common law definition
of arson to buildings other than dwellings. Of which of the following
crimes may the men be properly convicted?

(A) Arson only.

(B) Conspiracy only.

(C) Arson or conspiracy, but not both.

(D) Both arson and conspiracy.

129. The defendant's toolbox was stolen out of the back of his pickup truck.
The next day, the defendant saw the victim walking down the street
carrying what the defendant believed was his stolen toolbox. The
defendant jumped out of his truck and grabbed the toolbox from the
victim, yelling “If you don't give the toolbox to me, I'm going to shoot
you dead!” The victim gave the defendant the toolbox and the
defendant drove away. At the next stop sign a block away, the
defendant opened the toolbox and realized that the toolbox wasn't in
fact his missing toolbox. A police officer who saw the defendant grab
the victim's toolbox pulled up in his police car and immediately
arrested the defendant.

The defendant is charged with robbery. At trial, the prosecution shows
that because the victim's toolbox was much larger than the defendant's,
the defendant was unreasonable in the belief that the toolbox was his
stolen toolbox. However, the defendant shows that he honestly
believed the toolbox was his. The court should find the defendant

(A) guilty, because the defendant's belief that the toolbox was his

missing toolbox was unreasonable.

(B) guilty, because the defendant threatened to shoot the victim if he

didn't give him the toolbox.

(C) not guilty, because the defendant honestly believed the toolbox was

his missing toolbox.

524

(D) not guilty, because there was no indication that the defendant could

carry out on his threat.

130. Four weeks after breaking her engagement with her boyfriend, the
defendant was angry because her boyfriend still had not returned a
stereo that he had borrowed from her. She went to his house one night
to demand its immediate return. When she got there, the boyfriend was
not at home and his door was unlocked. The defendant entered to look
for her stereo but could not find it. While searching, she noticed that
the boyfriend had a new couch. Thinking that the couch was worth as
much as her stereo, she tore open one of its cushions and set it on fire
before leaving. The fire destroyed the couch completely and charred
the walls and ceiling of the room, although the house itself was not
seriously damaged. The defendant was subsequently prosecuted.
Statutes in the jurisdiction adopt the common law definitions of
burglary, larceny, and arson.

If the defendant is charged with larceny as a result of the destruction of
the couch, which of the following would be her most effective defense
against that charge?

(A) The boyfriend's door was unlocked when she entered.

(B) She believed the couch to be equal in value to her stereo.

(C) She did not physically move the couch.

(D) She did not intend to benefit from the destruction of the couch.

131. One day, the owner of a department store asked an employee in the
store's shoe department to temporarily replace a sporting goods
salesman who did not show up for work. A teenager, who was 15
years of age, subsequently entered the sporting goods department and
asked the employee to sell her ammunition for a pistol. The employee
placed a box of ammunition on the counter and said, “That'll be $9,
please.” Realizing that she did not have any money with her, the
teenager left the store without the ammunition, saying that she would
return for it later. A few hours later, while the owner was helping the
employee stock handguns, the teenager returned and bought the
ammunition.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides as follows: “Any person who
sells ammunition for a firearm to a person below the age of 16 years
shall be guilty of a felony. The employer of any person who violates

525

this section during the course of such employment shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $250. It shall not be a
defense to a violation of this section that the defendant had no
knowledge of the age of the person to whom the sale was made.”

If the owner is prosecuted under the statute, the owner should be found

(A) guilty, because her employee sold ammunition to a person under the

age of 16 years.

(B) guilty, because it was unreasonable for the owner to assign the

employee to the sporting goods department without properly
instructing him regarding the statute.

(C) guilty, because the owner was present when the employee made the

sale to the teenager.

(D) not guilty, because holding one person vicariously liable for the

crime of another violates the constitutional right to due process of
law.

132. A man was scared of heights. To cure him, his friend, a psychiatrist

and experienced mountain climber, convinced him to go mountain
climbing with her on Mount Smoke, the highest peak in the state. The
mountain was known as a tough and dangerous climb. It was also
known for the large amount of poisonous volcanic gases that escaped
from vents at the top. These gases were known to cause problems with
people's nervous systems. At the top of the mountain, the man and the
woman stood on the edge of a cliff to take a selfie. As they were about
to take the picture, a freak gust of wind blew a cloud of volcanic gas
over them. The toxins in the gas caused both the man and the woman to
lose voluntary control of their arms and legs. The woman punched the
man, knocking him off the cliff to his death.

Is the woman criminally liable for the man's death?

(A) Yes, because her punch was the proximate cause of his death.

(B) Yes, because she voluntarily put herself in contact with a gas

known to cause nerve problems.

(C) No, because the wind gust was a freak occurrence and

unforeseeable.

(D) No, because the gas made the woman lose control of her arms and

526

legs.

133. The defendant and a bank robber had been in the same cell together

while serving time in prison. Soon after their release, the bank robber
asked the defendant to join him in robbing a bank. The defendant
refused, stating that he did not want to go back to prison. The bank
robber then said that he would rob the bank himself if the defendant
would provide him with a place to hide afterwards. The defendant
agreed that the bank robber could hide in the defendant's apartment
following the robbery in return for one-fourth of the proceeds of the
robbery. The following day, the bank robber robbed the bank. One
week later, the bank robber was arrested at the defendant's apartment.

The defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery. The
court should find the defendant

(A) not guilty, because he did not agree to participate in the actual

perpetration of the robbery.

(B) not guilty, because the defendant's agreement to permit the bank

robber to stay at his apartment following the robbery was not per
se unlawful.

(C) guilty, because he was an accessory to the robbery.

(D) guilty, because he agreed to furnish the bank robber with a place to

hide in return for a portion of the proceeds of the robbery.

134. After his arrest for drug possession, the defendant asked to have his
attorney present and telephoned her office, leaving a message that he
had been arrested. When the attorney received the message, she
telephoned the county sheriff, asking where the defendant was being
held. The sheriff said that he did not know. However, this was a lie.
As a result of the lie, it took the attorney several hours to find the
defendant. While waiting for the attorney, one of the officers said to the
defendant, “Why don't you tell us about it?” whereupon the defendant
admitted growing marijuana. The defendant was subsequently charged
with violating a state law that prohibits growing marijuana.

The defendant's attorney made an appropriate motion to prevent the
use of the defendant's statement as evidence against him. The motion
should be

(A) granted, because the defendant asserted his right to have an attorney

527

present.

(B) granted, because the sheriff actually knew the defendant's

whereabouts when he said that he did not.

(C) granted, because the sheriff lied to the attorney.

(D) denied, because the defendant waived his right to remain silent

when he admitted growing the marijuana.

135. A man asked his friend, a doctor, for help killing his wife. The doctor
gave his friend a bottle of “deadly poison pills,” and told his friend to
give his wife two of them for “certain death.” The pills were actually
common muscle relaxants, and were widely available with a
prescription. The doctor did not think the pills could kill anyone,
although it would probably make his friend's wife go to sleep for a
little while. He thought that if his friend gave the pills to his wife and
believed he had killed her, he would regret his actions and change his
mind. That night, the man slipped the pills into his wife's wine glass.
His wife had a severe allergic reaction and almost died.

The man was prosecuted for conspiracy to murder his wife. How
should the court rule?

(A) Guilty, because he believed the pills were deadly poison.

(B) Guilty, because his wife almost died.

(C) Not guilty, because his wife did not die.

(D) Not guilty, because the doctor did not think the wife would die.

136. After a fight at a bar, police officers arrested one of the women

involved and drove her to the station. On the way, the police officers
advised the woman that she had the right to remain silent, that anything
she said might be used against her, that she was entitled to have an
attorney present during questioning, and that if she could not afford an
attorney, one would be furnished without cost. The woman said she
didn't want to answer any questions without her attorney present. The
officers allowed the woman to contact her attorney, who stated he
would get to the station when he could.

Several hours passed. The officers went to breakfast at a diner. At the
diner, the owner told them the diner had recently been robbed by a
woman. He described the woman and said one of his employees had

528

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

seen her later at a bar. The owner's description matched the woman the
officers had just arrested. When the officers returned, they gave the
woman breakfast they had brought from the diner and asked her if she
knew anything about the diner being robbed. The woman immediately
admitted robbing the diner.

At trial, the woman moved to exclude her confession. How should the
court rule?

(A) The confession should be excluded, because the woman said she

wouldn't talk without her attorney present.

(B) The confession should be excluded, because the officers did not tell

the woman they suspected her of robbing the diner before
questioning her.

(C) The confession should be admitted, because the woman received

Miranda warnings before admitting to the robbery.

(D) The confession should be admitted, because the woman waived her

Miranda rights by answering the officers' questions.

137. While playing baseball, the defendant and the victim got into an

argument when the victim, an umpire, called a strike on the defendant.
Enraged at what he perceived as unfair treatment, the defendant swung
as hard as he could and hit the victim in the head with the metal bat he
was using. The victim died instantly. The defendant then yelled,
“Geesh, I didn't mean to kill him!”

If the defendant is prosecuted for criminal homicide, the most serious
crime the defendant can be found guilty of is

(A) murder.

(B) voluntary manslaughter.

(C) involuntary manslaughter.

(D) battery.

138. A man was first in line for a new edition of an extremely popular
cellphone. Just as the doors to the store were opening, the victim
stepped in front of the man and said, “Too bad — I'm too important to
wait.” The defendant, who was standing in line behind the man, yelled,
“Hey, don't let him do that to you! Kill that jerk!” The man took a knife
from his pocket and stabbed the victim to death.

529

The defendant is charged with murder. He should be found

(A) guilty, because he yelled “Kill that jerk!”

(B) not guilty, because the defendant did not physically help the man in

any way.

(C) not guilty, because words alone are not enough for criminal

liability.

(D) not guilty, because there was no indication the defendant actually

intended the man to kill the victim.

139. Two undercover police officers received an anonymous tip that the

defendant was engaged in buying and selling stolen cars. The two
officers got a car from the police impound lot and then met with the
defendant. After the officers told the defendant that the car was stolen,
the defendant offered to buy it. When the defendant handed the officers
the money, they placed him under arrest.

The defendant is charged with conspiracy to receive stolen property.
The jurisdiction follows the common law view. The court should find
him

(A) guilty, because he believed the car was stolen.

(B) guilty, because the officers told him the car was stolen.

(C) not guilty, because neither officer intended to participate in the

purchase or sale of a stolen vehicle.

(D) not guilty, because the car that he agreed to purchase from the

officers was not actually stolen.

140. The defendant hired a hitman to kill a business rival. When the

defendant was out of town, the hitman went to the business rival's
home. The hitman looked through the window and saw the business
rival sleeping in a chair. The hitman fired five shots into the business
rival's chest and ran away. Unbeknownst to the hitman, the business
rival had died of a heart attack five minutes earlier. The shots would
have been fatal if the business rival was still alive. Two minutes after
fleeing the scene, the hitman checked his cellphone and found an
earlier message from the defendant stating that he was thinking of
calling off the hitman's contract. The defendant is arrested and charged
with attempted murder. The defendant should be found

530

(A) guilty, because the defendant hired the hitman to kill the business

rival.

(B) not guilty, because the defendant was out of town.

(C) not guilty, because the defendant attempted to withdraw from the

conspiracy.

(D) not guilty, because it was factually impossible to murder the

business rival.

ANSWERS TO 
CRIMINAL LAW QUESTIONS

1. D An officer executing a warrant for the search of premises is limited to a
search of the place described in the warrant. A misidentification will
invalidate the search unless the officer could not mistake the place to
be  searched.  The  officer  executing  the  warrant  could  not  have  been
certain  whether  it  was  for  a  tavern  known  as  the  Second  Bedroom
located on Main Street or for premises known as the Second Bedroom
located at 481 Chambers Street (but which contained a furniture store
rather  than  a  tavern).  It  may  therefore  be  successfully  argued  that  the
warrant  did  not  properly  identify  the  defendant's  premises,  and  the
search was invalid. While it is not certain that a court would come to
this  conclusion,  D  is  the  only  argument  listed  that  could  possibly
support the motion to suppress.

A  is  incorrect  because  an  affidavit  submitted  to  establish  probable
cause  may  be  based  entirely  on  hearsay.  If  it  establishes  the
credibility  of  the  informant  and  the  reliability  of  his  or  her
information, it may serve as the basis for the warrant, even though it
does  not  name  the  informant.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  affidavit
indicated that the informant had given information in the past that had
always  proved  to  be  accurate  (thus  establishing  his  credibility)  and
that  he  had  observed  the  activities  himself  (thus  establishing  the
reliability  of  his  information).  Even  without  establishing  credibility
and  reliability,  an  affidavit  that  fails  to  identify  the  informant  could
support the issuance of a warrant if the information that it contains is
corroborated by other independent evidence. C is incorrect, however,
because if credibility and reliability are established, corroboration is
unnecessary.

2. D A police officer who has probable cause to believe that the defendant
is  in  the  process  of  committing  a  crime  may  arrest  the  defendant
without a warrant. Upon making a lawful arrest, the police officer may
search  the  defendant's  person  and  packages  within  the  defendant's
control to prevent the loss of evidence and to protect the officer.

Some courts have held that one who ships baggage on an airline has
no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the contents of
the baggage; other courts hold that sniffing of baggage by a dog does
not  violate  the  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy  because  it  is

533

nonintrusive. Either way, most agree that such an inspection is not an
unreasonable search. A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect because
if  probable  cause  existed,  the  arrest  was  lawful  even  without  a
warrant. Since the dog sniffed the baggage after the plane had landed,
and  since  it  was  sniffing  for  marijuana  rather  than  weapons,  C  is  a
non sequitur and therefore is incorrect.

3.  B  Under  the  common  law,  rape  is  forced  sexual  intercourse  with  a
female,  who  is  not  the  spouse  of  the  defendant,  without  her  consent.
Modern statutes have expanded this definition to include male victims,
spouses, and other acts not amounting to sexual intercourse. Rape is a
“general intent” crime, which means that a conviction may be had even
though the defendant did not intend to engage in intercourse without the
female's consent if he acted recklessly or was criminally negligent in
determining  whether  or  not  she  consented.  It  is  necessary,  however,
that the defendant intend to engage in intercourse. If the defendant did
not intend to have intercourse, he cannot be convicted.

A  is  incorrect  because  it  may  have  been  reckless  or  criminally
negligent for the defendant to believe that the victim consented. Since
the  victim  initially  attempted  to  resist  the  defendant's  advances,  it
may  be  found  that  the  intercourse  was  without  her  consent  even
though  she  was  so  drunk  that  she  was  unaware  that  it  took  place  or
unaware of the defendant's identity. C and D are therefore incorrect.
C  is  also  incorrect  since  most  courts  agree  that  sexual  intercourse
with  a  woman  who  lacks  the  capacity  to  consent  because  she  is
unconscious or intoxicated is done without her consent and therefore
is rape. In addition, D is incorrect because a rape takes place when
penetration  occurs  without  consent  and  is  not  undone  if  the  victim
subsequently consents.

4.  B  Although  a  warrantless  search  is  usually  invalid,  it  may  be  valid  if
consented to by one with authority to consent. Since a guest in a hotel
is entitled to exclusive possession of the room that he or she occupies,
the hotel keeper does not have the power to consent to the search of a
guest's room, even if the guest is overdue in his or her payments. The
motion in B would probably be granted for this reason.

On the other hand, the owner of an automobile does have the power
to  consent  to  a  search  of  it,  so  the  motion  in  A  would  fail.  After  a
defendant's automobile has been impounded by the police, they have
the  right  to  search  it  for  the  purpose  of  making  an  inventory  of  its

534

contents. Although the reason for the inventory search is to protect the
police  against  possible  subsequent  claims  that  contents  of  the
impounded vehicle were taken or converted while the vehicle was in
police  custody,  evidence  that  is  incidentally  discovered  during  the
course  of  such  a  search  is  admissible  against  the  defendant.  The
motion in C would therefore fail. In D, the search did not take place
until  the  defendant  was  placed  under  arrest.  A  search  of  the
defendant's person conducted incidentally to a lawful arrest is not a
violation  of  his  Fourth  Amendment  right  to  be  secure  against
unreasonable search and seizure, so the motion in D would fail.

5. D Larceny is defined as a trespassory taking and carrying off of personal
property known to be another's with the intent to permanently deprive
the owner thereof. A taking is trespassory if it violates the rights of the
owner.  Since  the  coat  was  the  friend's  and  since  the  friend  told  the
defendant  to  take  it,  the  taking  did  not  violate  the  friend's  rights  and
was therefore not trespassory. A and C are therefore incorrect.

A criminal conspiracy is committed when two or more persons with
the  specific  intent  to  commit  a  crime  agree  to  commit  that  crime.
Since  the  friend  knew  that  the  coat  was  his,  he  did  not  have  the
specific  intent  to  commit  a  crime  when  he  agreed  to  help  the
defendant take it. B and C are therefore incorrect.

6. A A killing is intentional if the defendant desired or knew to a substantial
degree of certainty that it would result from his or her act. A killing is
deliberate and premeditated if the defendant was capable of reflecting
upon  it  with  a  cool  mind  and  did  in  fact  do  so.  Since  the  defendant
hoped for (i.e., desired) the victim's death, the killing was intentional.
Since he reflected on it in advance with a cool mind, it was deliberate
and premeditated.

Since first degree murder is the most serious crime listed, B, C, and
D  are  incorrect.  Voluntary  manslaughter  is  an  intentional  killing
resulting  from  extreme  emotional  disturbance  or  in  the  mistaken
belief  that  it  is  justified.  C  is  also  incorrect  because  there  is  no
indication that the defendant was emotionally disturbed or mistakenly
believed  that  his  act  was  justified.  Involuntary  manslaughter  is  an
unintended  killing  that  results  from  criminal  negligence.  D  is
incorrect because the defendant intended the death of the victim.

7. A Larceny is defined as a trespassory taking and carrying off of personal

535

the  defendant  acquired  possession  without 

property known to be another's with the intent to permanently deprive
the owner thereof. A trespassory taking is an acquisition of possession
contrary  to  the  rights  of  the  owner  and  without  the  owner's  consent.
the  victim's
Since 
permission,  he  committed  a  trespassory  taking.  A  carrying  off  occurs
when  the  defendant  moves  the  property,  even  slightly,  with  the
intention of exercising dominion over it. Since the defendant moved the
watch from the table to his pocket with the intention of keeping it, he
carried it off. Since he knew that the watch belonged to the victim and
intended to keep it for himself, he had knowledge that the property was
another's  and  intended  to  deprive  the  owner  of  it.  He  therefore
committed a larceny, making A correct.

A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to  bring  about  a  criminally  prohibited  result,  he  or  she  comes
substantially  close  to  bringing  it  about.  Although  the  defendant  is
probably guilty of attempted larceny, B is incorrect because larceny
is  a  more  serious  crime.  Embezzlement  is  defined  as  a  criminal
conversion  of  personal  property  by  one  in  lawful  custody  of  that
property. Employees who steal property from their employers while
in custody of it because of the employment relationship may be guilty
of embezzlement. C is incorrect, however, because the defendant did
not come into possession of the watch as a result of his employment
relationship with the victim. D is incorrect because the defendant is
guilty of larceny for the reasons stated above.

8.  C  At  common  law,  rape  can  be  committed  by  using  intoxicants  to
overcome  the  victim's  resistance.  Under  the  given  statute,  however,
third degree rape is committed only when a person over the age of 17
has sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16. Since the girl
was only 15, she cannot be guilty of committing it.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  statute
specifically provides that the crime can be committed by a female.

9. A The clerk is obviously guilty of bribery in the second degree because
she offered to alter the official records for $500. She cannot be guilty
of  conspiracy,  however,  because  of  Wharton's  Rule,  which  provides
that there can be no conspiracy unless the agreement involves at least
one  person  who  is  not  essential  to  the  commission  of  the  crime  to
which the conspirators agreed. The Wharton Rule applies to the crimes
of  bigamy,  incest,  gambling,  bribery,  adultery,  and  dueling.  Since  the

536

crime of bribery could not have been committed by either the clerk or
the store owner acting alone, neither can be found guilty of conspiring
with the other to commit it.

B,  C,  and  D  are  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  additionally  incorrect
because conspiracy is a separate crime that does not merge with the
crime that the conspirators agreed to commit.

10. C A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to bring about a result that is criminally prohibited, he or she comes
substantially  close  to  bringing  about  that  result.  Since  under  the
applicable  statute,  burning  down  one's  own  house  is  not  arson,  the
result that the defendant specifically intended to bring about was not
criminally  prohibited  by  the  arson  statute.  For  this  reason,  the
defendant  could  not  be  guilty  of  attempted  arson.  C  is  therefore
correct.

Even though it was factually impossible for a defendant to commit a
particular crime, he or she may be convicted of attempt if the crime
would  have  been  committed  had  the  facts  been  as  the  defendant
thought  them  to  be.  For  example,  if  the  defendant  burned  her  own
house  believing  it  to  be  the  dwelling  of  another,  she  could  be
convicted of attempted arson. Thus, A is an accurate statement of the
law. A is incorrect, however, because the defendant did not make a
mistake of fact (i.e., she knew that the dwelling was her own). Since
guilt for attempt requires the specific intent to accomplish a purpose
that is criminally prohibited, a person cannot be guilty if what he or
she  intended  to  accomplish  was  not  criminally  prohibited.  This  is
true  even  if  he  or  she  believes  that  it  is  criminally  prohibited,  no
matter how that mistaken belief was formed. B is therefore incorrect.
D  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  while  a  defendant  cannot  be
convicted of both a substantive crime and an attempt to commit that
substantive crime, he or she can be convicted of the attempt instead of
the  substantive  crime,  and  second,  the  defendant  is  charged  with
attempted arson, not attempted insurance fraud.

11.  A  Murder  is  the  unjustified  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought.  Malice  aforethought  includes  the  intent  to  cause  great
bodily  harm  to  a  human  being.  A  defendant  “intends”  a  particular
consequence if he or she desires or knows to a substantial degree of
certainty that it will occur. Since the defendant desired and/or knew
that exposure to the gas was likely to result in great bodily harm to the

537

coworker, she intended to cause great bodily harm to a human being.
Since the friend died, the defendant may be found guilty of his murder.
A is therefore correct.

B is incorrect because engaging in an inherently dangerous activity is
not  equivalent  to  malice  aforethought.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
defendant's  intent  to  cause  great  bodily  harm  to  any  human  being  is
sufficient  to  make  her  guilty  of  murder  in  causing  the  death  of  the
friend. Although the intent to kill is a form of malice aforethought, D
is  incorrect  because  the  intent  to  cause  great  bodily  harm  is  also  a
form of malice aforethought.

12. B A person is guilty of a criminal intent when, with the specific intent to
bring  about  a  criminally  prohibited  result,  he  or  she  comes
substantially  close  to  achieving  that  result.  Thus,  all  attempts  are
“specific  intent”  crimes.  This  means  that,  although  murder  may  be
committed without the intent to kill, attempted murder may not. If the
defendant  believed  that  the  victim  was  already  dead,  he  could  not
have  intended  to  kill  him  and  so  could  not  be  guilty  of  attempted
murder.

is 

incorrect  because 

A defendant with the specific intent to commit a particular crime may
be  guilty  of  attempting  it  even  though  accomplishing  the  intended
result  was  factually  impossible.  A 
the
defendant's  intent  to  kill  the  victim  could  make  him  guilty  of
attempted  murder  even  though  the  fact  that  the  victim  was  already
dead  made  murder  factually  impossible.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
defendant's belief that the gun was loaded could establish that he had
the specific intent to kill the victim, even though the fact that the gun
was unloaded made it factually impossible for him to accomplish the
result that he intended. D is incorrect because the defendant's belief
that the substance was a poison could help establish that he had the
specific  intent  to  kill  the  victim,  even  though  the  fact  that  the
substance was harmless made it impossible for him to accomplish the
intended result.

13. A Because of the possibility that manipulation of the circumstances of a
lineup  will  result  in  a  likelihood  of  inaccurate  identification,  the
United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  after  the  filing  of  formal
charges  against  him  or  her,  a  prisoner  is  entitled  to  the  presence  of
counsel at a lineup.

538

Since  all  prisoners  are  expected  to  obey  the  commands  of  their
jailers,  no  prisoner  is  required  to  resist  violations  of  his  or  her
constitutional  rights  by  those  in  apparent  legal  authority.  B  is
incorrect because it suggests that failure to resist results in waiver. C
is  incorrect  because  requirements  as  to  lineup  procedures  are  more
flexible  than  those  listed.  It  has  even  been  held  that  a  one-person
“show-up”  may  be  valid  if  it  is  conducted  properly.  The  taint  of  an
improper  lineup  procedure  may  be  purged  by  evidence  that  the  in-
court identification was arrived at by means distinguishable from the
lineup.  D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  victim's  courtroom
identification of the defendant was nothing more than a repetition of
the lineup identification.

14.  D  Even  in  the  absence  of  probable  cause  to  believe  that  health  and
safety violations exist in a particular building, a warrant to search it
for such violations may be issued upon probable cause to believe that
such violations exist in buildings in the neighborhood.

B  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  is  incorrect  because  such  a  scheme
justifies  the  issuance  of  warrants  like  those  issued  here,  rather  than
invalidating  it.  Although  the  courts  have  considerable  leeway  in
issuing  warrants  for  health  and  safety  inspections,  C  is  incorrect
because warrants are required by the Fourth Amendment to the United
States Constitution.

15. D  The  crime  of  receiving  stolen  property  consists  of  acquiring  stolen
property  with  the  knowledge  that  it  was  stolen  and  the  intent  to
permanently  deprive  the  owner  thereof.  Since  the  defendant  did  not
know that the television was stolen when he acquired possession of
it,  he  cannot  be  guilty  of  receiving  stolen  property.  A  and  C  are
therefore incorrect.

The crime of larceny consists of the trespassory taking and carrying
off  of  personal  property  known  to  be  another's  with  the  intent  to
permanently  deprive  the  owner  thereof.  Since  the  defendant  did  not
know that the television was the property of another when he took it
(i.e.,  received  it  from  his  friend),  he  cannot  be  guilty  of  larceny.  B
and C are therefore incorrect.

16.  D  At  common  law,  arson  is  defined  as  the  intentional  or  malicious
burning of the dwelling of another. Any burning that chars some actual
part  of  the  structure  is  sufficient  to  result  in  a  conviction.  Since  the

539

door  was  charred,  there  was  sufficient  burning  to  establish  the
defendant's guilt.

Although modern statutes prohibit the acts described in A, B, and C,
the  question  specifies  that  the  jurisdiction  applies  common  law
definitions of all crimes. Since common law arson involves a burning
of the dwelling of another, and since the structure that the defendant
attempted  to  burn  was  not  a  dwelling  and  was  his  own,  A  is
incorrect.  At  common  law,  larceny  by  trick  is  committed  when  the
defendant defrauds another into parting with temporary possession of
personal  property.  Since  the  insurance  company  gave  the  defendant
title to rather than temporary possession of the policy proceeds, B is
incorrect. Since the building that the defendant burned in C was not a
dwelling, C is incorrect.

17. A  If  a  defendant  makes  a  voluntary  incriminating  statement  that  is  not
induced  by  police  interrogation,  Miranda  does  not  apply  and  the
statement  can  be  used  against  the  defendant  in  court.  Here,  the
defendant  said  “everyone  knows  I  stabbed  the  guy”  in  response  to
“Do you need anything?” Interrogation occurs when the police ask a
question  that  they  should  know  is  reasonably  likely  to  elicit  an
incriminating response from the suspect. “Do you need anything?” is
unlikely to be viewed as such a question.

B  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the  rule  is  that  once  a  defendant
requests  an  attorney,  any  interrogation  must  cease.  There  is  no  rule
requiring that the attorney be produced immediately. In this case, no
interrogation had taken place yet. A “two-step” interrogation is where
a  police  officer  questions  a  suspect,  gets  a  confession,  gives  the
suspect Miranda warnings, and then questions the suspect to get the
confession  again.  Here,  there  is  no  indication  any  interrogation  had
begun, and the second officer's question, “Do you need anything?” is
unlikely  to  be  viewed  as  any  type  of  interrogation.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.

18.  A  An  officer  who  reasonably  suspects  a  person  of  a  crime  may  be
justified  in  questioning  that  person  about  his  or  her  identity  and
activity. If during the course of the conversation, he or she has reason
to  suspect  that  he  or  she  may  be  armed,  he  or  she  is  justified  in
frisking him or her for weapons. If during the course of a legitimate
frisk  for  weapons,  he  or  she  discovers  contraband  in  his  or  her
possession, it may be seized and used as evidence against him or her.

540

The  defendant  was  not  frisked  for  weapons,  however,  but  for  the
stolen statue. In the absence of a warrant or valid arrest, such a search
violates the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable search
and seizure.

B is incorrect because if a frisk is valid, items discovered during its
course  may  be  seized  and  used  as  evidence,  even  though  they  were
not what the officer was seeking. C is incorrect because there is no
fact  to  indicate  that  the  officer's  suspicion  was  reasonable,  and
because even a reasonable suspicion does not justify any warrantless
search  other  than  a  frisk  for  weapons.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
search  was  for  contraband,  not  for  a  weapon,  so  it  was  not  a  valid
pat-down search.

19. C  A  criminal  conspiracy  is  an  agreement  to  commit  a  crime,  and  it  is
complete  when  two  or  more  persons  make  such  an  agreement.
Although  the  boy  privately  decided  to  assist  the  other  boys  in  the
commission of a crime, he did not agree with them that he would do
so. He is therefore not guilty of conspiracy, and C is correct.

One who knowingly aids and abets in the commission of a crime is
guilty of that crime as an accessory. For this reason, the boy might be
guilty of murder. A is incorrect, however, because the boy is charged
not with murder but with conspiracy. Some jurisdictions hold that to
convict  for  conspiracy,  it  is  necessary  to  prove  an  overt  act  in
addition  to  an  agreement  to  commit  a  crime.  Even  in  these
jurisdictions,  however,  the  boy  would  not  be  guilty  of  conspiracy
because he did not agree to commit a crime. B is therefore incorrect.
Co-conspirators  are  guilty  of  the  crime  of  conspiracy  when  their
agreement is made and are not rendered innocent by the withdrawal
of  one  or  more  of  them  from  the  conspiracy.  D  is  incorrect  for  this
reason, and because the boy was never part of the conspiracy in the
first place.

20.  C  There  are  two  different  forms  of  criminal  assault  —  conduct  that
intentionally  induces  fear,  and  attempted  battery.  Criminal  battery  is
the intentional or reckless application of force to the body of another.
A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to  bring  about  a  criminally  prohibited  result,  he  or  she  comes
substantially close to achieving that result. Since the defendant shot at
the President with the intention of hitting him, he attempted a battery.
Since he did not succeed, his crime was assault.

541

A  is  incorrect  because  the  crime  of  which  he  was  acquitted  in  the
federal court was not the same crime with which he is charged in the
state  court.  It  is  generally  held  that  the  constitutional  protection
against double jeopardy is not offended by separate prosecutions for
violating the laws of two different sovereigns (i.e., federal and state
governments) even though both arise from the same act. Assault based
on  intentionally  inducing  fear  requires  that  the  victim  was  aware  of
the  defendant's  conduct,  and  that  as  a  result,  the  victim  experienced
reasonable apprehension of contact. B and D are incorrect, however,
because  assault  based  on  attempted  battery  requires  no  such
awareness or apprehension.

21. B  Many  jurisdictions  hold  that  the  defendant  will  not  be  guilty  of  the
murder  of  a  co-felon  under  the  felony-murder  rule  if  the  co-felon's
death resulted from a justifiable attempt by the victim to prevent the
crime. Although this is not the law in all jurisdictions, it is the only
argument listed that would provide the defendant with any defense at
all.

A is incorrect because the felony-murder rule is applied to deaths that
occur  during  the  commission  of  a  felony,  even  though  the  person
killed  is  not  the  intended  victim.  C is  incorrect  because  the  normal
reactions  of  victims,  bystanders,  and  police  make  violence  a
foreseeable  result  of  any  robbery.  D 
incorrect  because
jurisdictions  that  apply  the  felony-murder  rule  regard  the  intent  to
commit a felony as a form of malice aforethought.

is 

22.  D  Involuntary  manslaughter  is  an  unintended  killing  that  results  from
conduct that created a high and unreasonable risk of death or serious
injury or from the commission of a malum in se misdemeanor. If the
defendant's  conduct  created  such  risk,  he  could  thus  be  guilty  of
involuntary  manslaughter.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would
come  to  this  conclusion,  D  is  the  only  argument  listed  that  could
possibly support the prosecution.

The unlawful act doctrine (also called the misdemeanor-manslaughter
rule)  might  make  a  death  resulting  from  the  commission  of  a
misdemeanor  involuntary  manslaughter,  but  only  if  the  misdemeanor
involved  is  inherently  dangerous  or  malum  in  se.  Since  driving
without a license is neither, A is incorrect. B is incorrect because it
is  based  on  a  perversion  of  a  rule  of  tort  law  that  provides  that  the
violation of a statute that was designed to protect a class of persons

542

to which the plaintiff belongs from the risk that resulted in harm may
be  described  as  negligence  per  se.  There  is  no  counterpart  in  the
criminal  law,  however.  C  is  not  an  accurate  statement  since  mere
negligence will not result in a criminal conviction.

23. B Ordinarily, an omission (i.e., failure to act) does not lead to criminal
responsibility  unless  it  violated  a  legal  duty  to  act.  The  lifeguard's
duty to aid people at the swimming pool existed only because she was
employed as a lifeguard, and therefore it was in force only during her
hours of employment. Since her supervisor allowed her to leave at 8
P.M., her hours of employment ended at that time. For this reason, she
may  successfully  argue  that  she  had  no  duty  to  rescue  someone  who
came into peril after she left the pool.

If  she  did  have  a  legal  duty  to  render  aid,  her  absence  could  be  a
violation of that duty. A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Since  any  death  may
have  more  than  one  cause,  the  fact  that  the  adult's  inaction  was  a
cause  of  the  girl's  death  does  not  establish  that  criminal  conduct  by
the  lifeguard  was  not  also  a  cause.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect because, at common law and under statutes, there are many
forms of criminal homicide that can be committed without the intent
to cause the death of a person.

24.  A  Under  the  common  law,  rape  is  committed  when  the  defendant
intentionally  has  sexual  intercourse  with  a  female,  not  his  wife,
without  her  consent.  Although  it  is  necessary  that  the  victim  be
unwilling, it is not necessary for her to put up a fight if it would be
futile for her to do so or if she reasonably believes that resisting will
cause  her  to  sustain  serious  injury.  Since  the  victim's  refusal  was
overcome by a threat that would have led a reasonable person in her
place to fear for her life, the intercourse was without her consent.

If  her  resistance  had  been  overcome  by  payment,  the  intercourse
would  not  have  been  against  her  will.  But  the  fact  that  she  was
willing  to  accept  payment  does  not  mean  that  she  consented  to
intercourse  with  one  who  did  not  offer  payment,  or  even  with  one
who did. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because the victim's
resistance was overcome by the defendant's threat of physical force.
Since the victim inflicted the injuries after the intercourse occurred,
her conduct in inflicting them could not possibly relate to whether she
consented to the intercourse. D is therefore incorrect.

543

25.  C  Murder  is  the  unjustified  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought. Since malice aforethought includes the intent to kill, and
since the defendant held the baby's head under water in an attempt to
end  his  life,  the  defendant  had  the  necessary  mental  state  and
committed  the  necessary  act  to  make  her  criminally  responsible  for
murder. It is also necessary, however, for the prosecution to show that
her act was a proximate cause of the baby's death. Since there is no
clear indication that this is so, it is possible that the defendant may be
acquitted  of  murder.  In  addition,  many  states  have  rules  that  fix  a
period of time (usually one to three years) following a defendant's act
and  provide  that  no  death  occurring  after  that  time  is  proximately
caused  by  the  act.  Although  it  is  not  certain  that  her  argument  will
succeed, it is the only one listed that could possibly provide her with
an effective defense.

A is incorrect because no constitutional right to an abortion has been
found to exist in the last three months of pregnancy, and because the
baby was born alive. The defendant's attempt to save the baby's life
after she tried to kill him is not sufficient to relieve her of criminal
liability  for  his  death  if  his  death  was  proximately  caused  by  her
previous conduct. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Even  though  the  surgical
procedure  that  the  defendant  performed  did  not  usually  result  in  the
death of a human being, her attempt to kill the baby after he was born
makes D incorrect.

26. D One who intentionally kills another under the mistaken but reasonable
belief  that  he  or  she  was  defending  himself  or  herself  against
imminent  bodily  harm  may  be  protected  by  the  privilege  of  self-
defense and therefore be found not guilty of any criminal homicide. If
his or her belief was unreasonable, however, he or she is still guilty
of  voluntary  manslaughter,  although  not  of  murder.  A  is  incorrect,
because if the reasonable person would not have had held the belief,
the  defendant  is  guilty  of  voluntary  manslaughter.  B  is  incorrect
because if the defendant did not hold the belief, she is not only guilty
of voluntary manslaughter but of murder as well.

27. D Persons are guilty of conspiracy to commit a particular crime when
they  agree  to  commit  it.  At  common  law,  burglary  is  defined  as
breaking  and  entering  into  the  dwelling  of  another  at  night  for  the
purpose  of  committing  a  larceny  or  any  felony  therein.  Since  the
agreement was to break into an office rather than a dwelling, and to

544

do  so  at  lunchtime  rather  than  nighttime,  it  was  not  a  conspiracy  to
commit burglary. At common law, larceny is defined as intentionally
taking and carrying off the personal property of another with the intent
to  permanently  deprive  the  owner  of  it.  Since  the  agreement  was  to
copy but not carry off the professor's notes, it was not a conspiracy to
commit larceny. A, B, and C are thus incorrect.

28. A  Murder  is  the  unlawful  killing  of  another  with  malice  aforethought.
Even if there is no intent to kill, malice aforethought can be implied
when  there  is  a  reckless  indifference  to  an  unjustifiably  high  risk  to
human  life.  This  is  also  known  as  depraved  heart  murder.  Here,
because  the  defendant  shot  as  close  as  he  could  to  his  friend  as  his
friend  ran  in  front  of  a  concrete  wall,  a  court  would  likely  find  he
acted with reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human
life.  Consequently,  he  could  be  charged  with  murder.  D is  therefore
incorrect.

In most cases, voluntary manslaughter requires the defendant to kill in
the  “heat  of  passion.”  This  requires  some  type  of  provocation  that
causes the defendant to lose self-control. B is incorrect because there
was  no  provocation.  A  defendant  can  be  found  guilty  of  involuntary
manslaughter  when  his  or  her  behavior  is  grossly  negligent  and  an
accidental  death  results.  As  stated  above,  a  court  would  likely  find
the defendant's actions to be more than negligence, so C is incorrect.

29.  B  Obtaining  property  by  false  pretenses  is  committed  when,  with  the
intent  to  cause  the  victim  to  transfer  title  to  personal  property,  the
defendant makes a fraudulent misrepresentation that causes the victim
to  do  so.  Since  the  chemist  told  the  hunter  that  the  pills  were  made
from a secret formula that would protect him against the venom when
she  knew  that  statement  to  be  false,  and  since  she  did  so  for  the
purpose of obtaining money from him and succeeded in doing so, she
is guilty of false pretenses.

Attempted  murder  requires  a  specific  intent  to  cause  the  death  of  a
human  being.  Intent  to  cause  death  requires  either  the  desire  or
substantial certainty that death will result. Since the chemist believed
that  the  hunter  would  not  be  bitten  if  he  took  the  sugar  pills,  she
lacked the intent necessary to make her liable for attempted murder.
A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

30. D Self-defense is a privilege to use reasonable force to protect oneself

545

against  aggression.  In  determining  whether  force  was  reasonable,
courts usually balance the danger likely to result from its use against
the  benefit  of  using  it.  If  the  benefit  that  would  be  apparent  to  the
reasonable  person  in  the  defendant's  situation  outweighs  the  danger
that  would  be  apparent  to  the  reasonable  person  in  the  defendant's
situation, the force that the defendant used was reasonable. Since it is
generally  understood  that  the  reasonable  person  would  consider  the
benefit of saving his or her own life to be of greater weight than the
danger of killing an assailant, it is usually held that lethal force (i.e.,
force likely to kill or do serious bodily harm) is reasonable if used by
a  person  who  reasonably  believes  that  he  or  she  is  being  attacked
with  lethal  force.  Thus,  if  it  was  reasonable  for  the  defendant  to
believe that her life was in danger, it was probably reasonable for her
to use lethal force to protect it.

A is incorrect because the defendant was attempting to protect herself
rather than the cocaine. Even if the drug addict was actually unarmed,
the  defendant's  reasonable  belief  that  he  had  a  pistol  might  have
privileged  her  use  of  lethal  force  in  self-defense.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. A person who is committing a crime has no right to defend
himself or herself against a lawful arrest. Since the drug addict was
not attempting to arrest the defendant, however, the fact that she was
committing  a  crime  at  the  time  of  his  attack  is  irrelevant.  C  is
therefore incorrect.

31.  A  Battery  is  an  intentional  harmful  or  offensive  touching  of  another
person.  Shooting  someone  with  a  shotgun  is  clearly  a  battery.  A  co-
conspirator in a criminal operation is liable for any crimes committed
by another co-conspirator if the crime was foreseeable and committed
in furtherance of the conspiracy. Here, the brothers conspired to run a
methamphetamine  lab.  The  shooting  was  foreseeable  because  the
brothers kept the shotgun around to protect the lab. The shooting was
committed  in  furtherance  of  the  conspiracy  because  the  defendant's
brother  was  protecting  the  lab  when  he  shot  the  undercover  officer.
Consequently,  the  defendant  would  be  liable  for  the  battery.  C  is
therefore incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  defendant  would  be  liable  based  on  the
conspiracy,  not  because  he  acted  with  any  type  of  reckless
indifference.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  question  of  whether  drug
dealing is dangerous or not has no effect on the relevant analysis.

546

32.  D  Embezzlement  is  the  conversion  of  personal  property  known  to  be
another's with the intent to defraud, by a person in lawful possession
of the property. Since the seller's possession was the result of fraud
and  therefore  not  lawful,  he  is  not  guilty  of  embezzlement.  A  and  C
are  therefore  incorrect.  Larceny  by  trick  is  committed  when  the
defendant  fraudulently  induces  the  victim  to  deliver  possession  of
personal property to the defendant. If the victim transfers title to the
property  involved,  the  crime  of  larceny  by  trick  has  not  been
committed.  Since  the  buyer's  intention  was  to  make  the  seller  the
owner of the money, he transferred title to the money, and therefore B
and C are incorrect.

33. C Although killing with the intent, at least, to cause great bodily harm is
ordinarily  classified  as  murder,  it  may  be  reduced  to  voluntary
manslaughter if the defendant was acting in the heat of passion. This
is  only  so,  however,  if  the  provocation  that  produced  the  passion
would have done so in the person of ordinary temperament.

A is a fabrication; there is no “theory of deliberate provocation.” B is
incorrect  because  the  objective  standard  described  above  (i.e.,  the
person  of  ordinary  temperament)  makes  the  wife's  emotional
peculiarities irrelevant. D is based on a misinterpretation of the law.
An intentional killing may be reduced from murder to manslaughter if
the defendant was acting under the mistaken belief that the killing was
justified. This is known as the theory of mistaken justification. D  is
incorrect because the wife did not act in the mistaken belief that she
was justified, and because D would erroneously apply the theory to
prevent reduction to manslaughter.

34. C At common law, burglary is defined as breaking and entering into the
dwelling  of  another  at  night  with  the  intent  to  commit  a  larceny  or
felony therein. If, at the time the defendant entered, he did not intend
to commit an act that would amount to a crime, he cannot be guilty of
burglary.

A “breaking” occurs when the defendant creates the opening through
which  he  or  she  enters,  even  though  no  force  is  used.  A  and  B  are
incorrect, because by opening the door to the victim's apartment, the
defendant  created  the  opening  through  which  he  entered,  thus
committing  the  necessary  breaking.  The  crime  of  burglary  is
committed, if at all, at the time the unlawful entry takes place with the
requisite state of mind. Conduct performed subsequently (i.e., leaving

547

a note) does not undo a crime that has already been committed. D is
therefore incorrect.

35.  C  Since  all  the  incidents  of  unconsciousness  occurred  within  three
months after the accident and nearly three years ago, it was probably
reasonable  for  the  defendant  to  believe  that  they  would  not  occur
again.  If  she  entertained  that  belief,  and  if  it  was  reasonable,  she
cannot  be  said  to  have  knowingly  disregarded  the  plain  and  strong
likelihood of harm as required by the statute. Although it is not certain
that  a  court  would  come  to  that  conclusion,  C  contains  the  only
argument listed that could possibly support the defendant's defense.

A  is  incorrect  because  if  the  defendant  did  knowingly  disregard  the
plain  and  strong  likelihood  of  further  blackouts,  it  would  not  matter
what caused them. B is incorrect because the crime, if any, took place
when the defendant drove in knowing disregard, and so would have
already  been  committed  by  the  time  the  defendant  passed  out.  D  is
incorrect because the statute does not require knowledge that death or
serious  injury  will  result,  but  only  knowledge  that  there  is  a  strong
likelihood that it will.

36.  D  The  Fourth  Amendment  only  protects  people  from  searches  and
seizures  that  are  carried  out  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  government.
Consequently,  if  the  government  is  not  involved  in  the  search,  the
the  Fourth
Fourth  Amendment  does  not  apply. 
Amendment is not violated if a private person, acting alone, conducts
a  search  or  seizure  and  then  passes  the  evidence  along  to  the
government. Here, the man was acting purely as a private citizen. The
fact that he then gave the evidence he discovered to the police does
not  turn  him  into  a  government  agent  answerable  to  the  Fourth
Amendment.

Importantly, 

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

37.  A  Voluntary  manslaughter  is  committed  when  the  defendant,  with  the
intent to cause death or great bodily harm, causes the death of a human
being  under  circumstances  such  that  the  defendant  is  acting  in  the
“heat of passion.” The belief that the neighbor brutally murdered his
family probably is sufficient to furnish the heat of passion that reduces
the crime from murder to manslaughter.

B is incorrect for two reasons: First, deliberation and premeditation
require a mind that is capable of thinking coolly and rationally, and

548

under the circumstances, the defendant probably wasn't, and second,
deliberation  and  premeditation  are  not  elements  of  voluntary
manslaughter.  Since  voluntary  manslaughter  is  a  lesser  offense
included in first degree murder, the defendant could be convicted of
voluntary manslaughter even if he were guilty of first degree murder.
C  is  incorrect  because  it  suggests  that  guilt  of  first  degree  murder
would  prevent  a  conviction  for  voluntary  manslaughter.  Convicting
and sentencing for crime are functions of the court, not of the family
of  the  crime's  victim.  D  is  incorrect  because  it  suggests  a  law  of
vendetta (i.e., that if the neighbor was the killer, the defendant could
punish him without incurring criminal responsibility).

38. D Larceny is a trespassory taking and carrying off of personal property
known  to  be  another's  with  the  intent  to  permanently  deprive  the
owner of it. Although the defendant planned to return the money in the
event of one contingency, she planned not to return it in the event of
another. This contingent intent to permanently deprive is sufficient to
make her guilty of larceny when she took and carried off the money on
Friday night.

A is incorrect because she took the money with the intent (contingent
at least) to permanently deprive the owner. B is incorrect because she
intended  not  to  return  it  if  she  lost.  Since  the  crime  was  committed
when she took the money, the fact that she did or did not return it all
on Monday morning is irrelevant. C is therefore incorrect.

39. B Although most statutes that forbid the sale of alcohol to minors impose
strict liability (i.e., defendant's knowledge is not an element), this one
does not because it prohibits only the knowing sale. If the defendant
reasonably  believed  that  the  teenager  was  over  the  age  of  21,  he
lacked the knowledge that is requisite to a conviction.

Not  knowing  whether  wine  was  an  intoxicating  substance  under  the
statute would not be a defense because all persons are conclusively
presumed to know the law. Ignorance of the law is not a defense. A is
therefore incorrect. Entrapment is available as a defense only when a
police officer induced the defendant to commit a crime that he or she
was  not  already  disposed  to  commit.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
police officer did nothing to encourage the sale. The statute prohibits
the  sale  of  intoxicating  substances  without  regard  to  whether  or  not
anyone becomes intoxicated by them. D is therefore incorrect.

549

40. D Under the “unlawful act doctrine” (also known as the “misdemeanor-
manslaughter  rule”),  a  person  may  be  guilty  of 
involuntary
manslaughter if a death results from his or her commission of a crime
that is malum in se or inherently dangerous. Neither of these factors
exists  here.  Therefore,  A  is  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because
voluntary manslaughter requires the intent to kill or cause great bodily
harm,  and  the  knowledge  that  death  is  possible  is  not  sufficient  to
constitute  such  intent.  Most  jurisdictions  hold  that  criminal  or
culpable negligence that results in death may support a conviction for
involuntary  manslaughter.  In  some  of  those  jurisdictions,  culpable
negligence  is  defined  as  unreasonable  conduct  in  the  face  of  a
foreseeable risk. In others, more is required: either that the defendant
knew  of  the  risk  and  willfully  disregarded  it,  or  that  under  the
circumstances  known  to  the  defendant,  his  or  her  conduct  created  a
high degree of risk of death or serious bodily injury. Since the facts
do not indicate that the defendant engaged in unreasonable conduct in
the face of a foreseeable risk, willfully disregarded a known risk, or
under the circumstances knew her conduct created a high risk of death
or serious bodily injury, C is incorrect because there is no evidence
of criminal negligence.

41. B Self-defense involves a privilege to use reasonable force to prevent
what is reasonably perceived as a threat of imminent bodily harm. If a
defendant makes a mistake regarding the need for self-defense, courts
will  look  at  whether  such  a  mistake  was  reasonable.  If  the  mistake
was reasonable, the defendant is entitled to claim he or she acted in
self-defense. Here, the recent robberies, time of day, robber's threat,
and the metal spatula handle in the back likely made it reasonable for
the defendant to believe he was in danger of being shot. A is incorrect
because the primary question is whether the defendant's actions were
reasonable,  not  whether  they  were  justified. C  is  incorrect  because
self-defense does not require a defendant to verify the truth of his or
her belief; it just requires that that belief is reasonable. D is incorrect
because  the  circumstances  here  likely  made  the  defendant's  actions
reasonable.

42. A A person is guilty as an accessory to a crime when he or she aids and
abets  in  its  perpetration.  At  common  law,  a  defendant  commits  rape
when he or she has sexual intercourse with a woman who is not his
wife  without  the  woman's  consent.  Although  under  this  definition  a
husband cannot be guilty as a principal of raping his wife, he can be

550

guilty  as  an  accessory  if  he  aids  and  abets  another  to  have  sexual
intercourse with her without her consent. Since the defendant assisted
the  drug  dealer  in  committing  rape  (i.e.,  having  intercourse  with  the
wife without her consent), he is guilty of rape as an accessory.

Depending  on  the  statutory  definitions  of  procuring  for  prostitution
and  possession  of  narcotics,  the  defendant  may  be  guilty  of  all  the
crimes  listed.  B, C,  and  D  are  incorrect,  however,  because  rape  is
clearly the most serious of them.

43.  A  Larceny  is  defined  as  the  trespassory  taking  and  carrying  off  of
personal  property  known  to  be  another's  with  the  intent 
to
permanently  deprive  the  owner  thereof.  Since  the  defendant's  taking
and carrying off of the candy dish was inconsistent with his friend's
rights,  it  was  trespassory.  Since  the  defendant  knew  that  the  candy
dish  was  his  friend's,  and  since  giving  it  to  his  sister  as  a  wedding
present  would  permanently  deprive  his  friend  of  it,  he  committed
larceny, and A is correct.

Burglary  is  the  breaking  and  entering  into  the  dwelling  house  of
another  for  the  purpose  of  committing  a  felony  therein.  Since  the
defendant entered to recover his own camera, his purpose was not to
commit  a  felony,  and  he  is  not  guilty  of  burglary,  B  is  therefore
incorrect.  A  person  is  guilty  of  a  criminal  attempt  when,  with  the
specific intent to bring about a result that is criminally prohibited, he
or  she  comes  substantially  close  to  bringing  about  that  result.  Since
the defendant did not have the purpose of committing a felony inside
his  friend's  home,  he  lacked  the  intent  necessary  for  burglary  and
therefore could not be convicted of attempted burglary. C is therefore
incorrect. D is incorrect because the defendant is guilty of larceny as
explained above. The larceny was committed at the moment that the
defendant  carried  off  the  candy  dish  with  the  requisite  intent,  and  it
was not uncommitted when he returned the item.

44. C  A  person  is  guilty  of  attempting  to  commit  a  crime  when,  with  the
specific intent to bring about a criminally prohibited result, he or she
comes  substantially  close  to  achieving  that  result.  Since  involuntary
manslaughter  is  unintended  homicide,  there  can  be  no  attempt  to
commit it because the requisite state of mind cannot exist.

A and B are therefore incorrect. Since there is no requirement that a
person  be  prosecuted  for  the  highest  possible  crime  that  he  or  she

551

committed, D is incorrect.

45. C The defendant obviously did not have the intent to cause the death of
the  accomplice  and  was  obviously  not  engaged  in  committing  rape,
robbery,  or  kidnapping  at  the  time  that  the  accomplice  was  killed.
Under the common law definition, burglary is a breaking and entering
into the dwelling of another at night for the purpose of committing a
felony  therein.  Since  the  defendant  was  not  attempting  to  enter  a
dwelling house, he was not committing a burglary either.

A  is  incorrect  because  most  jurisdictions  apply  the  felony-murder
rule to the killing of one felon by another. B is incorrect because the
statute  does  not  require  that  the  felony  being  committed  is  a
dangerous  one.  While  assumption  of  the  risk  is  a  defense  in  tort
actions, it is not in criminal prosecutions. D is therefore incorrect.

46. D The victim of a crime does not share the guilt of the perpetrator, even
though  the  victim's  participation  was  necessary  to  the  crime's
commission.  If  the  law  was  designed  to  protect  people  in  the
defendant's  position  against  people  in  the  personnel  manager's
position, the defendant can be regarded as the victim of the personnel
manager's  act  and  thus  escape  criminal  liability.  While  it  is  not
certain that a court would be persuaded by this argument, it is the only
one listed that could possibly result in dismissal.

Although the statement contained in A was correct at early common
law, it is no longer true in a majority of jurisdictions. B is factually
incorrect, since the personnel manager could not have committed the
crime if the defendant had not paid him the money. Under Wharton's
Rule,  persons  who  agree  to  commit  a  crime  cannot  be  convicted  of
conspiracy  unless  at  least  one  of  them  was  not  essential  to  the
commission of that crime. Wharton's Rule applies to bigamy, incest,
gambling, bribery, adultery, and dueling. Since the crime created by
the  statute  could  not  have  been  committed  by  one  person  alone,
Wharton's  Rule  would  prevent  the  conviction  of  the  personnel
manager and the defendant for conspiracy to commit it. C is incorrect,
however, because the defendant is not being charged with conspiracy,
but  with  being  an  accessory  to  the  substantive  crime,  and  because
accessories frequently are people without whom the crime could not
have been committed.

47.  A  Robbery  is  larceny  accomplished  by  force  or  a  threat  of  force

552

directed at the lawful possessor of the property taken. The defendant's
snatching of the purse was accomplished by force, and the hand in his
pocket coupled with his words constituted a threat of force.

Larceny  by  trick  requires  that  the  victim  give  up  the  property  in
reliance on the defendant's fraud. Since the victim's purse was taken
by  force,  B  is  incorrect.  Embezzlement  is  criminal  conversion  of
personal  property  by  one  in  lawful  possession.  C  is  incorrect
because  the  defendant  did  not  obtain  possession  of  the  property
lawfully. Larceny by false pretenses involves a misrepresentation of
fact  that  is  intended  to  and  does  in  fact  cause  the  victim  to  transfer
title  to  property.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  victim  did  not  transfer
title to the defendant.

48. A Larceny is a trespassory taking and carrying off of property known to
be  another's  with  the  intent  to  permanently  deprive.  There  is  no
requirement  that  the  victim's  possession  of  the  property  be  lawful.
The  defendant's  taking  of  the  plant  was  trespassory,  and  therefore  a
larceny,  because  she  had  been  authorized  to  water  it,  not  to  carry  it
off. The defendant could not be guilty of burglary since her use of the
key  that  the  doctor  gave  her  prevents  her  entry  from  constituting  a
breaking, which requires force against the premises.

49. B  Rape  is  sexual  intercourse  without  consent  of  the  female.  Since  the
bank  teller's  resistance  was  overcome  by  the  defendant's  threat  and
her  resulting  fear  of  death,  the  intercourse  occurred  without  her
consent. One who commands another to do an act is responsible for
the  criminal  consequences  thereof.  Although  the  defendant  did  not
himself  have  sexual  intercourse  with  the  teller,  he  is  guilty  of  rape
because  he  commanded  the  bank  manager  to  do  so.  Solicitation  is
committed  by  encouraging,  ordering,  or  commanding  another  to
commit  a  crime.  If  the  person  solicited  actually  commits  the  crime,
however,  solicitation  merges  with  the  substantive  crime  and  is  not
subject to separate prosecution.

50. B Ordinarily, no person has standing to assert the constitutional rights of
another. For this reason, a defendant who seeks to suppress evidence
seized  as  the  result  of  the  search  of  another  person  may  not
successfully  argue  that  the  search  and  seizure  were  unconstitutional
unless he or she had a sufficient possessory or proprietary interest in
the  thing  searched  to  give  him  or  her  a  reasonable  expectation  of
privacy that was violated by the search. Since the car and the pistol

553

were  both  the  man's,  and  since  the  defendant  thus  could  not  have  a
reasonable  expectation  of  privacy,  the  defendant  has  no  standing  to
object to the search, and his motion should be denied.

For  the  reasons  stated  above,  C  and  D  are  incorrect.  Usually,  a
search  without  a  warrant  violates  the  rights  of  the  person  searched
unless it is incident to a lawful arrest. Since the facts do not indicate
that  the  man  was  arrested  prior  to  the  search  of  his  glove
compartment,  the  search  probably  did  violate  his  rights.  A  is
therefore incorrect.

51. D Under the common law, burglary is the breaking and entering into the
dwelling house of another, at night, with the intent to commit a felony
therein.  Most  states  have  changed  burglary  to  include  entry  into  any
kind of structure at any time of the day. Here, since what the man was
intending to do wasn't a crime, he can't be convicted of burglary.

A is incorrect because the issue is whether what the man intended to
do  was  a  felony,  not  that  the  man  intended  to  commit  a  felony  by
doing something that wasn't actually a crime. B is incorrect because
the  burglary  would  have  been  complete  the  minute  he  entered  the
church  if  what  he  was  doing  was  actually  a  felony.  Importantly,
burglary  requires  the  intent  to  commit  a  felony,  not  its  actual
completion.  C  is  incorrect  because  his  underlying  actions  did  not
actually  add  up  to  burglary,  so  he  clearly  could  not  be  liable  for
attempt.

52.  A  A  search  may  be  lawful  if  consent  is  given  by  one  in  apparent
authority  to  do  so.  If  the  student  actually  was  the  defendant's
roommate,  she  would  have  had  authority  to  consent  to  a  search  of
common areas of their room. Since she told the police that she was,
and since she had a key to the room, it was probably reasonable for
them  to  believe  her.  Her  apparent  authority  might,  thus,  justify  the
search. While a court might not find it to be so, the argument in A is
the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  denial  of  the
defendant's motion.

B  is  incorrect  because  although  information  received  from  an
informant  might  furnish  probable  cause  sufficient  to  permit  the
issuance of a warrant, the informant's belief is not sufficient to justify
a  warrantless  search.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  defendant  had  no
expectation  that  any  other  person  would  enter  the  room  in  her

554

absence.  Although  she  knew  that  the  sorority  retained  a  copy  of  her
room key, she knew also that this was done to facilitate duplication in
the  event  that  a  resident  lost  her  key.  D  is  incorrect  because  even
though  there  are  some  cases  indicating  that  a  primary  or  secondary
school  administrator  can  consent  to  a  search  of  a  locker  used  by  a
student,  this  view  has  not  been  applied  to  college  students  or  to
searches  of  a  student's  room,  and  the  student  was  not  a  school
administrator.

53. B One who, with the intent that a crime will be committed, encourages

another to commit that crime, is liable for it as an accessory.

A is incorrect because mere presence at the scene of a crime is not
sufficient, even if the defendant intended or was willing for the crime
to be committed. C is incorrect because the words of encouragement
need  not  create  a  new  danger  for  liability  to  be  imposed.  D  is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  under  some  circumstances,  words
alone might be sufficient, and second, here, the words were coupled
with intent.

54. A Under the M'Naghten test, a person may be found not guilty by reason
of insanity only if mental illness prevented him or her from knowing
the  nature  and  quality  of  his  or  her  act  or  from  knowing  that  the  act
was legally wrong. Since the defendant knew what he was doing (i.e.,
that he was poisoning the governor), and he knew that it was against
the law, he was not insane.

B  refers  to  the  irresistible  impulse  supplement,  and  it  is  incorrect
because  the  facts  indicate  that  the  jurisdiction  has  adopted  only  the
M'Naghten test. C is incorrect because it refers to the Durham Rule,
which is no longer applied in any jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions,
a  defendant  is  insane  under  the  M'Naghten  rule  if  mental  disease
caused  him  or  her  to  suffer  from  a  delusion  within  the  context  of
which the defendant's act would be lawful. D is incorrect, however,
because  even  within  the  context  of  the  defendant's  delusion,  the
defendant knew that killing the governor was an unlawful act.

55. B  Although  statutory  rape  is  sometimes  called  a  strict  liability  crime,
this  means  only  that  liability  can  be  imposed  even  though  the
defendant  was  not  aware  that  the  female  with  whom  he  was  having
intercourse  was  underage.  No  liability  can  be  imposed,  however,
unless the defendant had intent to engage in intercourse.

555

A is incorrect because liability for involuntary manslaughter may be
imposed  if  the  victim's  death  resulted  from  reckless  conduct  by  the
defendant. Driving while drunk may be sufficiently reckless to result
in liability. C is incorrect because even if the defendant did not know
that she was drunk, it may have been reckless for her to drive while
she  knew  that  her  vision  and  motor  abilities  were  impaired.  Since
voluntary manslaughter is the killing of a human being with the intent
to  kill  or  to  cause  great  bodily  harm  under  circumstances  of  great
emotional  distress,  D  is  incorrect  because  the  facts  asserted  by  the
defendant would inculpate rather than exculpate him.

56.  C  Murder  is  defined  as  criminal  homicide  with  malice  aforethought.
Since  homicide  involves  an  act  that  causes  the  death  of  a  human
being,  and  since  the  victim's  death  in  C  did  not  result  from  the
defendant's  act,  the  defendant  could  not  be  guilty  of  murdering  the
victim.

Malice  aforethought  is  the  intent  to  kill,  the  intent  to  cause  great
bodily harm, the intent to commit a felony, the intent to escape from
lawful custody, or acting with wanton disregard for human life. A is
incorrect  because  the  defendant's  desire  to  cause  the  victim  great
bodily  harm  might  constitute  malice  aforethought.  B  is  incorrect
because knowledge of the victim's identity is not a material element
of  either  murder  or  of  malice  aforethought.  Since  the  defendant  did
intend to cause the victim's death, he had the requisite mens rea, even
though he believed the victim to be someone else. D is incorrect for
two reasons: First, shooting at the bank guard was a felony, and the
intent  to  commit  a  felony  may  constitute  malice  aforethought  in  a
prosecution  for  the  death  of  any  person  killed  during  the  course  of
that felony, and second, starting a gun battle in a bank can be regarded
as wanton disregard for human life, which may also constitute malice
aforethought.

57. D An examination of a defendant's effects is a search if it is conducted
under  circumstances 
reasonable
that  violate 
expectation  of  privacy.  Ordinarily,  a  person  has  a  reasonable
expectation that an apartment that he or she has the exclusive right to
occupy  will  remain  private.  For  this  reason,  the  inspection  of  the
defendant's apartment probably violated his reasonable expectation of
privacy  and  therefore  was  a  search.  Ordinarily,  a  search  of  a
defendant's effects violates his or her Fourth Amendment rights unless

the  defendant's 

556

it  is  conducted  pursuant  to  a  warrant.  Since  the  examination  of  the
defendant's  apartment  was  conducted  without  a  warrant,  it  violated
the  defendant's  rights.  Evidence  seized  in  violation  of  a  defendant's
Fourth Amendment rights is inadmissible under the exclusionary rule.

A is incorrect because the plastic pouch was not in plain sight until
the officer entered, and the entry itself violated the defendant's rights.
B is incorrect because a landlord does not have the power to waive
his  or  her  tenant's  constitutional  rights  —  even  if  he  or  she  is  the
tenant's  mother.  At  one  time,  Miranda  warnings  were  not  required
until a person became a suspect. No such qualification ever applied
to  the  right  to  be  secure  against  unreasonable  search  and  seizure,
however. C is therefore incorrect.

58. A  Since  the  statute  requires  knowledge  that  the  statement  is  false,  and
since  the  defendant  believed  the  statement  to  be  true,  he  lacked  the
required mental state to be guilty of perjury.

D is therefore incorrect. If, as the result of his attorney's advice, the
defendant  believed  that  he  had  not  been  convicted  of  a  crime,  he
lacked the knowledge necessary to make him guilty under the statute.
However,  the  defendant's  reliance  on  the  advice  of  counsel  would
not, in itself, have prevented him from being guilty unless he actually
believed  that  advice,  so  B  is  incorrect.  Since  a  guilty  plea  is
equivalent to a conviction, C is incorrect.

59. D Kidnapping is defined as the intentional asportation and confinement
of a person against that person's will, by force or threat, and without
lawful  authority.  Since  the  defendant  did  not  know  that  the  daughter
was in the car when he drove it away, he lacked the requisite intent.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  kidnapping  has  no
equivalent of the felony-murder rule. C is incorrect since if he knew
that  the  daughter  was  in  the  car,  the  defendant  could  be  guilty  of
kidnapping even if the asportation of the daughter was secondary to
his stealing of the car.

60.  D  The  double  jeopardy  clause  prevents  a  person  from  being  placed
twice  in  jeopardy  for  the  same  offense.  This  does  not  prevent
prosecution by two separate sovereigns for crimes arising out of the
same  transaction,  however,  because  a  different  offense  has  been
committed  against  each  sovereign.  In  addition,  the  two  crimes  with
which  the  defendant  is  charged  are  not  identical.  (The  federal

557

prosecution  is  for  illegal  importation;  the  state  prosecution  is  for
illegal possession.)

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  since  it  has  been  held  that
customs agents have probable cause to search the car of any person
entering  the  United  States.  C  is  incorrect  because  it  is  generally
understood that jeopardy begins as soon as a trial commences.

61. B Since the statute prohibits possession of a skeleton key with the intent
to  commit  an  unlawful  entry,  and  since  the  defendant  was,  in  fact,
attempting  to  effect  an  unlawful  entry  with  his  skeleton  key,  he  is
guilty of violating the statute.

A is incorrect because the fact that the defendant was a professional
thief is not enough to make him guilty of violating any law, even one
designed to protect the public against professional thieves. The crime
defined  by  the  statute  would  merge  into  the  crime  of  attempted
burglary if the defendant was charged with or convicted of attempted
burglary. But in the absence of an attempted burglary charge, there is
no reason why the lesser crime cannot be prosecuted. C is therefore
incorrect.  A  careful  reading  of  the  statute  discloses  that  it  punishes
conduct  (i.e.,  possession  of  a  skeleton  key)  coupled  with  a  guilty
mind. D is therefore incorrect.

62. B Since the statute defines as third degree manslaughter any death that
proximately  results  from  the  commission  of  a  crime,  the  defendant
cannot  be  found  guilty  under  the  statute  unless  the  victim's  death
proximately resulted from his crime.

Although the common law misdemeanor-manslaughter rule is applied
only  to  deaths  resulting  from  the  commission  of  misdemeanors  that
are  mala  in  se,  the  statute  given  makes  no  such  requirement.  A  is
therefore incorrect. C is incorrect for the same reason, and because
there is no indication that the defendant was driving while intoxicated
at the time the accident occurred. D is incorrect because neither the
common  law  rule  nor  the  statute  requires  that  the  risk  be  a
foreseeable one.

63. C One who intentionally aids or facilitates the commission of a crime is
guilty of the crime as an accessory. Robbery is larceny committed by
force  or  threat  of  force.  Although  the  defendant  did  not  point  a  gun
and demand money, she aided and abetted the student by operating the
getaway  car.  She  is  thus  guilty  as  an  accessory.  Conspiracy  is  an

558

agreement to commit a crime made by two or more people who have
specific intent. The defendant and the student committed the crime of
conspiracy when they agreed on the commission of the robbery.

A, B, and D are incorrect because the crime of conspiracy is separate
from  and  does  not  merge  into  the  substantive  crime  that  the
conspirators agreed to commit.

64. B A defendant is guilty of murder when he or she proximately causes the
death  of  another  human  being  unlawfully  and  with  malice
aforethought.  Malice  aforethought  consists  of  the  intent  to  kill,  the
intent  to  cause  great  bodily  harm,  escape  from  lawful  custody,  the
commission  of  a  felony,  or  reckless  disregard  for  human  life.  Since
there are no facts indicating that the defendant in B intended to kill or
cause harm, was escaping from lawful custody, or engaged in conduct
demonstrating  a  reckless  disregard  for  human  life,  the  only  way  he
could  be  convicted  of  murder  would  be  if  the  pedestrian's  death
proximately resulted from the commission of a felony. There is no fact
indicating that violation of the insurance statute was a felony. Even if
it was, the violation was not causally related to the pedestrian's death
since the death would have occurred whether or not the vehicle was
insured.  For  this  reason,  the  defendant  could  not  be  convicted  of
murder.

An  unlawful  killing  committed  with  the  intent  to  kill  or  inflict  great
bodily  harm  might  be  voluntary  manslaughter  if  the  defendant  was
acting under extreme emotional distress or mistaken justification. The
defendant in A might still be convicted of murder, however, because
the  lapse  of  time  between  his  discovery  of  the  atrocity  that  the
neighbor  committed  and  his  killing  of  the  neighbor  could  prevent  a
court  from  finding  that  he  was  acting  under  extreme  emotional
distress. A is therefore incorrect. Although the defendant in C did not
have  an  intent  to  kill,  his  conduct  might  be  regarded  as  sufficiently
reckless to result in a conviction for murder. Although it is possible
that the defendant in D was acting under sufficient emotional distress
for  the  killing  to  be  regarded  as  voluntary  manslaughter  rather  than
murder, courts rarely make special allowances for “mercy” killings.
D is therefore incorrect.

65. B A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to bring about a criminally prohibited result, he or she performs some
act  that  comes  substantially  close  to  achieving  that  result.  Many

559

jurisdictions  hold  that  if  the  result  that  the  defendant  specifically
intended  to  bring  about  was  not  a  crime,  the  defendant  cannot  be
guilty of a criminal attempt. This is sometimes known as the doctrine
of  legal  impossibility.  Although  not  all  jurisdictions  recognize  this
defense, it is the only argument listed that could furnish the defendant
with an effective defense in any jurisdiction.

Since the elements of criminal attempt are often included among the
elements  of  the  substantive  crime  that  was  attempted,  criminal
attempts are often lesser included offenses of the substantive crimes.
Lesser  offenses  are  said  to  merge  with  the  crime  in  which  they  are
included,  which  means  that  a  person  who  is  convicted  of  a
substantive crime cannot also be convicted of attempting it. There is
no requirement that a defendant be prosecuted for the highest or most
serious crime resulting from his or her act, however. This means that
a  prosecutor  may  choose  to  charge  a  defendant  with  attempting  a
crime, even if a conviction for the substantive crime could have been
obtained.  For  this  reason,  the  fact  that  the  defendant  actually
succeeded  in  killing  a  bird  would  not  prevent  his  conviction  for
attempting to do so, and A and D are incorrect. A person is in pari
delicto with another when they are equally guilty. Since the friend did
not commit or attempt to commit a crime, he is not guilty of anything
and therefore is not in pari delicto with the defendant. C is therefore
incorrect.

66. D Voluntary manslaughter is the killing of a human being with the intent
to  kill  or  inflict  great  bodily  harm,  under  circumstances  of  extreme
emotional distress (or mistaken justification). Frequently, the rage that
accompanies a discovery of infidelity by a spouse has been held to be
sufficient  emotional  distress  to  reduce  an  intentional  homicide  from
murder  to  voluntary  manslaughter.  Most  jurisdictions  apply  an
objective  standard,  however,  in  judging  a  defendant's  emotional
distress.  Thus,  if  a  person  of  ordinary  temperament  would  not  have
lost  self-control,  the  defendant's  emotional  distress  would  not  have
been  sufficient  to  result  in  a  reduction  of  his  crime  from  murder  to
manslaughter.

A and B are incorrect because although a killing with the intent to kill
or  inflict  great  bodily  harm  may  be  murder,  extreme  emotional
distress  may  reduce  it  to  voluntary  manslaughter  even  though  the
defendant intended to kill or inflict great bodily harm. Although anger
that  results  from  the  defendant's  catching  his  spouse  in  flagrante

560

delicto (i.e., in the act) may justify reducing a murder charge to one
of manslaughter, C  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  requirement  that

67. B  Evidence  obtained  in  violation  of  a  defendant's  constitutional  rights
may not be used against him or her. The United States Supreme Court
has held that Miranda  warnings  must  be  given  before  questioning  a
person  in  custody.  An  interrogation  conducted  without  giving  the
required Miranda warnings thus violates a defendant's rights, making
confessions so obtained inadmissible. The warnings are required only
when the person being questioned is in custody, however. Thus, if the
defendant was not in custody at the time his statement was made, his
rights  have  not  been  violated,  and  his  statement  should  not  be
excluded. A person is in custody when the police deprive him or her
of his or her freedom of action in any significant way. It is possible
that a court would find that the officer's pointing toward the back seat
of  the  patrol  car  was  an  order  coupled  with  an  implied  threat
sufficient  to  deprive  the  defendant  of  his  freedom,  and  that  he  was
therefore in custody. It is also possible, however, that the defendant's
entry into the police car was voluntary, and that it did not, therefore,
amount  to  custody.  Of  all  the  arguments  listed,  however,  this  is  the
only one with any possibility of success.

Even if a defendant's confession is excluded because of a failure to
give the required Miranda warnings, he or she may be convicted on
the  basis  of  other  evidence.  The  existence  of  such  independent
evidence,  although  it  may  convict  the  defendant,  does  not  make
admissible the confession that was obtained in violation of his or her
rights.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Prior  to  the  Miranda  decision,  the
Supreme Court's Escobedo decision required that a suspect be given
certain warnings as soon as he or she became the focus of a police
investigation.  C 
incorrect,  however,  because  Miranda
subsequently  changed  the  “focus”  test  to  a  “custody”  test,  requiring
that warnings be given only after the suspect was in custody. Whether
or not the investigation was routine, Miranda warnings are required
whenever  the  person  interrogated  is  in  custody.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

is 

68. D Arson is the intentional or reckless burning of the dwelling of another.
Although  the  defendant  caused  the  burning  of  the  homeowner's

561

dwelling,  he  did  not  do  so  intentionally  since  he  believed  that  there
would be no damage. (Note: Although some jurisdictions hold that a
reckless  burning  may  be  arson,  the  facts  indicate  that  the  defendant
acted reasonably.)

Although violation of a statute may be evidence of negligence or even
of  recklessness,  a  statutory  violation  is  not  in  itself  sufficient  to
satisfy the mens rea requirement for arson. A is therefore incorrect. B
is  incorrect  because  it  would  impose  criminal  liability  without  the
necessary  mens  rea.  C  is  incorrect  because  consent  by  the
homeowner  to  the  defendant's  use  of  fireworks  is  not  equivalent  to
consent to the burning of his home.

69.  B  Murder  is  a  killing  with  malice  aforethought.  Malice  aforethought
includes  wanton  disregard  for  human  life,  which  means  acting  in
deliberate  disregard  of  the  plain  and  strong  likelihood  that  death  or
great bodily harm would result. Operating a motor vehicle at a speed
of 100 miles per hour might or might not be found to constitute wanton
disregard for human life, but of the reasons listed, B is the only one
that could result in a conviction for murder.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  culpable  negligence  is
insufficient to constitute malice aforethought, and second, the facts do
not indicate that the defendant was intoxicated at the time the accident
the  misdemeanor-manslaughter  rule,  a  death
occurred.  Under 
resulting from the commission of a misdemeanor might be classified
as manslaughter. Since driving without a license carries a maximum
sentence of less than one year (i.e., 30 days), it is properly classified
as  a  misdemeanor.  C  and  D  are  incorrect,  however,  because  the
misdemeanor-manslaughter  rule  cannot  lead  to  a  conviction  for
murder.

70.  C  All  jurisdictions  that  recognize  a  felony-murder  rule  apply  it  only
when  the  victim's  death  (or  the  injury  that  leads  to  it)  occurs  during
the commission of a felony. Since the stroke that caused the owner's
death did not occur until the day after the defendant robbed the store,
it did not occur during the perpetration of a felony by the defendant,
and the felony-murder rule does not apply.

A and B are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because many cases
have held that since the victim of a robbery is likely to respond with
force, even a robbery with a toy gun is a dangerous felony.

562

71.  A  “Specific  intent”  crimes  are  those  that  require  a  state  of  mind
amounting  to  a  desire  or  knowledge  by  the  defendant  that  his  or  her
conduct  will  result  in  a  consequence  that  is  criminally  proscribed.
“General intent” crimes are those for which conviction may be based
on  recklessness  or  criminal  negligence.  Voluntary  intoxication  may
provide  a  defense  to  crimes  requiring  specific  intent  since  it  may
prevent its formation. Awareness of the effect that alcohol is likely to
have  on  the  capacity  to  assess  risks,  however,  prevents  voluntary
intoxication  from  serving  as  a  defense  to  crimes  involving  general
intent.  Since  rape  may  consist  of  recklessly  having  intercourse
without the victim's consent, it is a general intent crime, and voluntary
intoxication is not a defense to it.

Involuntary  intoxication,  on  the  other  hand,  may  be  a  defense  to
crimes  involving  recklessness,  as  well  as  to  specific  intent  crimes.
The  defendant's  assertion  in  B  might  therefore  provide  her  with  an
effective defense. Since attempted robbery requires the specific intent
to  commit  a  larceny  by  force  or  threat  of  force,  the  defendant's
intoxication  in  C  may  have  prevented  her  from  having  the  intent
required and may thus provide her with an effective defense. In D, the
defendant's assertion is that he lacked the intent to deprive the rightful
owner of possession of the automobile. Since this specific intent is an
essential element of larceny, his intoxication may provide him with an
effective defense.

72.  B  Receiving  stolen  property  consists  of  the  acquisition  of  stolen
property with the knowledge that it has been stolen and with the intent
to permanently deprive its owner of it. Acquisition occurs when the
defendant takes possession of the property himself or herself, or when
he  or  she  directs  that  possession  be  delivered  to  another.  Thus,
although  the  defendant  did  not  personally  take  possession  of  the  car
that the man stole, he received it when he directed that it be delivered
to his brother.

In A, the car that the defendant received had already been recovered
by the police and was therefore not stolen at the time of the sale. In C
and D, there is no indication that the cars sold to the defendant ever
had been stolen. A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

73. B After being advised of his or her Miranda rights, a suspect in custody
cannot  be  subjected  to  police  interrogation  unless  he  or  she
voluntarily and intelligently waives those rights. If the officers were

563

unaware that the defendant could overhear their conversation, the first
officer's  comment  was  not  an  interrogation  of  the  defendant,  and  the
defendant's statement was not obtained in violation of his rights.

If  the  defendant's  statement  was  the  result  of  an  interrogation,  it
violated  his  rights  unless  he  waived 
them  voluntarily  and
intelligently.  A  is  incorrect  because  it  would  make  the  defendant's
waiver  intelligent  but  not  necessarily  voluntary  (e.g.,  he  may  have
been intimidated by the presence of police). C is incorrect because it
would  make  the  defendant's  waiver  voluntary,  but  not  necessarily
intelligent (e.g.,  he  might  not  have  understood  his  rights).  The  U.S.
Constitution  protects  the  defendant  against  custodial  interrogations,
even if the custody itself is lawful. D is therefore incorrect.

74. D Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying off of personal property
known to be another's with the intent to permanently deprive. In this
definition,  “trespassory”  means  without  the  consent  of  the  owner.
Since  rearranging  the  merchandise  in  the  storeroom  was  part  of  the
defendant's  duties  and  therefore  done  with  the  store's  consent,  her
moving  of  the  lawnmower  was  not  trespassory.  Taking  means
acquiring  possession.  Since  the  defendant  did  not  transfer  the
lawnmower from her employer's possession to her own, she did not
take  it.  Although  any  exercise  of  dominion  accompanied  by  even  a
slight movement may constitute a “carrying off,” the defendant moved
the lawnmower as part of her duties and without any intention — at
that time — of making it her own. She therefore did not carry it off.
For a person to be guilty of larceny, the intent to permanently deprive
must  exist  at  the  time  she  took  and  carried  off  the  chattel  involved.
Although the defendant did decide to permanently deprive the store of
the  lawnmower,  she  did  not  perform  any  act  that  might  be  taking  or
carrying  off  after  making  that  decision.  For  these  reasons,  the
defendant  is  not  guilty  of  larceny.  Embezzlement  is  a  criminal
conversion  of  personal  property  by  one  in  lawful  custody  of  it.
Conversion takes place when the defendant seriously interferes with
the  rights  of  the  owner,  usually  by  exercising  dominion  or  control
the  defendant  never  did  anything
over 
inconsistent  with  the  store's  rights  in  the  lawnmower  and  never
exercised  dominion  or  control  over  it,  she  cannot  be  said  to  have
converted it. She is not therefore guilty of embezzlement.

the  chattel.  Because 

75. C In the majority of states, if a defendant made an unreasonable mistake

564

as to the need for force in self-defense, the defendant's crime can be
reduced  from  murder  to  voluntary  manslaughter  even  though  such  a
claim  does  not  completely  excuse  a  defendant's  actions.  This  is
referred to as a claim of “imperfect” self-defense. Here, the question
states  that  the  defendant  honestly  but  unreasonably  believed  that  he
needed to use deadly force to protect himself from the victim's laser
gun.  Given  the  circumstances  of  the  victim's  job,  the  defendant's
intoxication, and the particulars of the cellphone, such a belief could
be  honest  yet  unreasonable.  Importantly,  the  question  tells  you  to
assume  that  the  court  believes  the  defendant's  version  of  events,
whether or not you believe the defendant's belief to be ridiculous. A
is  incorrect  because  self-defense  requires  a  reasonable  belief  as  to
the need for force. Here, the question states that the defendant's belief
was  unreasonable.  B 
the  defendant's
unreasonable  belief  will  have  an  effect  on  his  case.  D  is  incorrect
because  depraved  heart  murder  has  to  do  with  situations  where  a
defendant  acted  with  such  great  recklessness  that  he  or  she  can  be
said to have extreme indifference to the value of human life. In these
situations,  the  defendant  is  not  necessarily  intending  to  kill  anyone,
but is acting in such a way as to make someone's death likely.

incorrect  because 

is 

76.  B  When  the  words  deliberate  and  premeditated  appear  in  a  murder
statute, deliberate means that the defendant was possessed of a cool
mind  capable  of  reflection,  and  premeditated  means  that  the
defendant actually did reflect on his or her act before committing it.
Since  the  psychiatrist's  testimony  indicates  that  the  defendant  may
have been incapable of cool reflection at the time of his act, it may be
admitted for the purpose of showing that the killing was not deliberate
and premeditated.

A is incorrect because under the M'Naghten test, a defendant is insane
only  if  mental  disease  made  him  or  her  incapable  of  knowing  the
nature  and  quality  of  his  or  her  act,  or  that  it  was  wrong.  C  is
incorrect because the testimony may be admitted to establish lack of
deliberation and premeditation, even though it does not establish that
the defendant was insane. An intentional killing may be reduced from
murder  to  voluntary  manslaughter  if  the  defendant  was  acting  in  the
heat  of  passion  caused  by  sufficient  provocation.  For  this  purpose,
the provocation and defendant's response to it are usually judged by
an objective standard. D is incorrect, however, because, as explained
above, psychiatric evidence of the defendant's state of mind may be

565

relevant to the elements of deliberation and premeditation.

77. D  If  the  only  evidence  against  the  defendant  was  excluded  because  it
was obtained by coercing his confession, his motion to dismiss might
be  granted.  But  although  a  coerced  confession  cannot  be  used  in  a
criminal  prosecution  against  the  person  who  made  it,  evidence  that
was  obtained  independently  of  the  coerced  confession  can  be  used.
Since the federal officer obtained evidence of the defendant's identity
without  knowledge  of  the  defendant's  statement,  the  defendant's
motion must be denied.

A and B are therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because if the federal
officer's  discovery  of  the  evidence  against  the  defendant  resulted
from  a  violation  of  the  defendant's  constitutional  rights,  it  might  be
excluded in spite of the fact that the federal officer was employed by
the federal government and the state police officer by the state.

78. D  A  conspiracy  is  an  agreement  to  commit  a  crime.  Conspirators  are
vicariously  liable  for  crimes  committed  in  furtherance  of  the
conspiratorial  goal  by  other  members  of  the  conspiracy.  This  is  so
even if those crimes were unforeseeable, not included in the original
plan, or unnecessary to the success of the conspiracy, so long as they
were  committed  in  furtherance  of  the  conspiratorial  goal.  Since  the
roommate  transported  the  car  across  a  state  line  for  the  purpose  of
aiding  their  escape,  it  was  in  furtherance  of  the  conspiratorial  goal.
A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

79. B A statement made in response to a custodial interrogation of a suspect
is admissible against him or her only if, after being advised of his or
her  Miranda  rights,  he  or  she  makes  a  voluntary  and  intelligent
waiver.  Since  the  defendant  concedes  that  her  statements  were
voluntary,  the  only  remaining  issue  is  whether  she  had  sufficient
knowledge  and  understanding  of  her  rights  to  intelligently  waive
them.  The  same  issue  was  resolved  in  B,  in  which  the  defendant's
response to the officer's question made it doubtful that the defendant
understood his constitutional rights.

In A, since the defendant was not in custody at the time he answered
the  officer's  questions  (and  since  the  question  was  probably  not  an
“interrogation”), the issue of waiver did not arise. Although a person
who has been formally charged with a crime is entitled to counsel at
a  lineup,  C  is  not  applicable  since  the  defendant  had  not  been

566

formally  charged  with  any  crime,  and  since,  therefore,  she  was  not
entitled to counsel, no issue of waiver arose in her case. The Fourth
Amendment  protects  against  warrantless  search,  but  this  protection
may be waived by a person who voluntarily and intelligently consents
to such a search. Waiver was, therefore, an issue in D. Although the
officer's  statement  might  not  have  been  sufficient  to  make  the
defendant's  waiver  intelligent,  the  circumstances  —  an  unexpected,
middle-of-the-night  visit  by  three  uniformed  police  officers  —  also
raise  serious  doubts  about  its  voluntariness.  For  this  reason,  B  (in
which  the  only  issue  was  the  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the
waiver)  is  more  applicable  as  a  precedent.  [Note:  Case-summary
analysis  questions  are  usually  as  uncertain  as  this  one.  Fortunately,
they are no longer common on the MBE.]

80.  B  The  crime  of  receiving  stolen  property  is  committed  when  the
defendant receives stolen property with the knowledge that it is stolen
and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. Since the
car  that  the  defendant  purchased  was  in  the  lawful  custody  of  the
police, it could be argued that it was no longer stolen. Although it is
not certain that this argument would succeed, it is the only one listed
that  could  possibly  be  effective  in  the  defendant's  defense.  B  is
therefore correct.

Since the police are supposed to prevent crime rather than instigate it,
many  jurisdictions  hold  that  a  defendant  who  was  induced  by  the
police or an agent of the police to commit a crime that he or she was
not  otherwise  disposed  to  commit  is  entrapped  and  has  a  valid
affirmative  defense  to  the  crime  charged.  A  is  incorrect,  however,
because  the  defendant  came  looking  for  a  stolen  car  and  was
therefore  already  disposed  to  commit  the  crime  with  which  he  was
charged. Ordinarily, a defense may not be based on the assertion of
another's  rights.  If  the  man's  cooperation  was  coerced,  the  man's
rights may have been violated. C is incorrect, however, because the
defendant  may  not  base  his  defense  on  the  invasion  of  the  man's
rights.  D  is  incorrect  because  no  right  of  the  defendant's  was
bargained away.

81. C If a warrantless search violates a reasonable expectation of privacy
held  by  the  person  whose  property  is  searched,  it  violates  that
person's  Fourth  Amendment  rights.  Since  each  person  who  shares
property with another knows that the other has access to it, neither of

567

them  has  a  reasonable  expectation  that  the  property  will  remain
private. For this reason, a search is generally valid if authorized by
one of the persons who share the property that is searched. Since the
girlfriend shared the apartment, the bedroom, and the closet with the
defendant,  the  defendant  could  have  no  reasonable  expectation  that
these areas would remain private, and the girlfriend's consent to the
search made it valid.

Although a search warrant may not be issued without probable cause,
probable  cause  does  not  justify  a  search  without  a  warrant.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  If  police  discover  contraband  during  hot  pursuit
of  a  suspect,  they  may  be  permitted  to  seize  it  without  a  warrant  if
necessary to prevent disposal or destruction. B is incorrect, however,
because the police were not in hot pursuit of the defendant when they
discovered the marijuana. The seizure of contraband “in plain view”
might be valid because its discovery was not the result of a search. D
is incorrect, however, because the police officers had already begun
their  search  (i.e.,  by  having  the  girlfriend  open  the  closet  door  for
them to look inside it) when the marijuana fell into view.

82. D The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall be placed
twice  in  jeopardy  for  the  same  offense.  It  is  generally  understood,
however,  that  jeopardy  does  not  begin  until  the  commencement  of  a
trial,  which  occurs  when  a  jury  is  impaneled.  Since  a  grand  jury
proceeding is not “jeopardy,” there is no constitutional reason why a
matter should not be brought before a grand jury several times.

A and B are therefore incorrect. In addition, A is incorrect because
the  term  res  judicata  is  applied  only  to  a  final  determination  by  a
court.  C  is  incorrect  because  jeopardy  has  not  yet  begun,  so  the
motion must be denied, whether or not the first grand jury's decision
was motivated by prejudice.

83.  D  Murder  is  the  unjustified  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought.  Malice  aforethought  means  a  wanton  disregard  for
human  life,  or  an  intent  to  kill,  inflict  great  bodily  harm,  commit  a
felony, or resist a lawful arrest. Since it is clear that the defendant did
not  intend  to  commit  a  felony,  to  resist  a  lawful  arrest,  or  to  strike
anyone with the bullet, she can be found guilty of murder only if her
conduct  showed  a  wanton  disregard  for  human  life.  Thus,  if  she  is
acquitted, it can only be because the court found that her conduct did
not show a wanton disregard.

568

A  is  incorrect  because  malice  aforethought  may  exist  without  an
intent to kill. Since any result may have many proximate causes, the
fact that the ambulance driver's conduct was a proximate cause of the
victim's death does not establish that the defendant's conduct was not
also  a  proximate  cause  of  that  death.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The
privilege to abate a nuisance permits the use of reasonable force only.
Although  the  conduct  of  the  defendant's  neighbors  may  have
constituted a nuisance, it is obvious that the use of a deadly weapon
was not a reasonable response to it. C is therefore incorrect.

84. C A person is privileged to use reasonable force to protect himself or
herself  from  what  he  or  she  reasonably  believes  to  be  a  threat  of
imminent  bodily  harm.  Potentially  lethal  force  is  reasonable  when
used in response to what the defendant reasonably perceives to be a
threat  of  potentially  lethal  force.  Thus,  if  the  defendant  reasonably
believed  that  the  victim  was  reaching  for  a  gun,  her  use  of  a  gun  in
response may have been reasonable and therefore privileged. While it
is not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the argument
in C is the only one listed that could possibly provide the defendant
with an effective defense.

A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the intent to bring
about  a  criminally  prohibited  result,  he  or  she  comes  substantially
close to achieving it. A is incorrect because the fact that a death did
not  actually  occur  will  not  prevent  a  conviction  for  attempting  to
cause one. If the defendant had the intent to kill the victim when she
aimed  her  pistol  at  the  victim's  chest,  she  would  be  guilty  of
attempted  murder  if  she  came  subsequently  close  to  causing  the
victim's death. This might be so even if she did not strike the victim
in  the  chest,  or  even  if  she  did  not  strike  the  victim  at  all.  For  this
reason, B is incorrect. D  is  incorrect  because  deadly  force  is  force
that  is  likely  to  result  in  death  or  great  bodily  harm.  The  use  of  a
pistol  thus  constitutes  deadly  force  even  though  the  harm  that  it
actually causes happens to be slight.

85.  D  Murder  is  the  unjustified  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought. In addition to reckless disregard for human life, and the
intent to kill, to cause great bodily harm, or to resist a lawful arrest,
malice aforethought includes the intent to commit a dangerous felony.
Since arson is a dangerous felony, D is correct.

A is incorrect because malice aforethought may exist even though the

569

defendants did not intend to kill. Some jurisdictions have held that the
felony murder rule cannot be applied unless the deaths were totally
independent of the defendants' purpose in committing a felony. B is a
misstatement  of  this  rule  and  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect
because  unreasonable  conduct  is  not  sufficient  to  constitute  malice
aforethought.

86.  B  Kidnapping  consists  of  intentionally  transporting  and  confining  a
person against that person's will by force or threat and without legal
authority.  The  essential  difference  between  kidnapping  and  criminal
false  imprisonment  is  the  requirement  of  asportation:  Unless  the
defendant has moved the victim to the place of confinement, there is
no kidnapping. Since the defendant forced the hostage to accompany
him to his car, where he confined her for a period of 15 minutes, he
has kidnapped her. Because he did not move any of the other victims
to the place of their confinement, he did not kidnap them.

A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

87. A A defendant is guilty of criminally receiving stolen property when he
or  she  acquires  stolen  personal  property  with  knowledge  that  it  is
stolen and with the intent to permanently deprive its owner. Since the
car  that  the  defendant  purchased  from  the  other  officer  had  been
requisitioned from the police department, it was not stolen property.
Since  the  defendant  never  received  stolen  property,  he  cannot  be
guilty of this crime.

B  is  incorrect  because  guilt  does  not  require  that  the  defendant  pay
for stolen property with his own money (or that he pay for it at all).
Police officers are supposed to prevent crime, not to cause it. For this
reason, many jurisdictions hold that a defendant who was entrapped
(i.e., induced by a police officer to commit a crime that he or she was
not otherwise inclined to commit), cannot be convicted of committing
it.  The  officers  did  not  entrap  the  defendant  because  the  defendant
indicated his inclination to purchase a stolen car before either officer
suggested that he do so. C is therefore incorrect. A search or arrest
warrant may not be issued without a showing of probable cause, but
no  such  showing  is  required  before  beginning  an  investigation.  For
this reason, D is incorrect.

88.  B  Arson  is  the  intentional  or  malicious  burning  of  the  dwelling  of
another.  Since  even  the  slightest  charring  of  the  walls  or  ceiling  is

570

regarded  as  a  burning,  there  was  a  burning  of  the  boyfriend's
dwelling.  Since  malice  includes  recklessness,  and  since  it  was
clearly reckless to set fire to a couch while it was inside the house,
the  necessary  state  of  mind  is  present.  The  defendant  is  therefore
guilty of arson.

Burglary is the trespassory breaking and entering of the dwelling of
another  at  night  with  the  intent  to  commit  a  larceny  or  any  felony
therein. The defendant entered the boyfriend's dwelling at night. The
unauthorized opening of a closed door can constitute a breaking, and
any  unauthorized  entry  is  trespassory.  Although  the  defendant  did
commit a felony inside (i.e., arson), she cannot be guilty of burglary
unless she intended to do so when she entered. Since at the time the
defendant  entered  the  boyfriend's  house,  she  meant  only  to  retrieve
her  own  property,  she  did  not  have  the  requisite  intent  to  make  her
guilty  of  burglary.  A  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because the defendant is guilty of arson as explained above.

89.  D  Because  of  the  inherently  coercive  nature  of  police  custody,  the
United  States  Supreme  Court  held  (in  Miranda)  that  inculpatory
statements  resulting  from  custodial  interrogation  of  a  defendant  are
inadmissible unless the defendant received certain warnings prior to
making the statements. Among the required warnings is a caution that
anything  that  the  defendant  says  may  be  used  against  him  or  her.
Because the informant was working for the police, it is possible that
his  conversation  with 
to  a  police
interrogation.  Thus,  if  the  defendant  was  in  custody  at  the  time,  his
statement  might  be  inadmissible  because  he  had  not  received
Miranda  warnings.  The  Miranda  rule  applies  only  to  custodial
interrogations, however. So, since the defendant was not in custody at
the time of his conversation with the informant, the lack of Miranda
warnings would not make his statement to the informant inadmissible.

the  defendant  amounted 

A is incorrect because even though the informant might have been an
agent of the police at the time he and the defendant shared a cell (i.e.,
while  the  defendant  was  clearly  in  custody),  the  statements  in
question were not made at that time. B is incorrect because Miranda
warnings are required for custodial interrogations only. The issue to
be determined is whether the conversation between the informant and
the defendant was a custodial interrogation and therefore a violation
of the defendant's rights. C  assumes  that  the  defendant's  rights  were

571

violated and uses that assumption to prove that the defendant's rights
were violated. This is circular reasoning and is therefore incorrect.

90. C Under the “irresistible impulse” test, a person is not guilty by reason
of insanity if mental disease made him or her incapable of controlling
his or her conduct at the time of the alleged criminal act. Although not
all  jurisdictions  accept  this  definition  of  insanity,  under  the  facts
given, C is the only argument listed that would serve as an effective
defense in any jurisdiction.

The M'Naghten rule provides that a person is not guilty by reason of
insanity  if,  at  the  time  of  the  allegedly  criminal  act,  mental  disease
prevented him or her from knowing either the nature and quality of his
or her act or that it was wrong. A defendant is said to know that his or
her act is “wrong,” however, if he or she is aware that it is prohibited
by law. Since the defendant knew that if he was caught, he would be
imprisoned  for  murder,  he  had  sufficient  understanding  that  his  act
was wrong to make him sane under this rule. A is therefore incorrect.
The  concept  of  “intent”  relates  to  the  defendant's  state  of  mind
regarding  the  immediate  consequences  of  his  or  her  act,  quite  apart
from the concept of “motive,” which refers to a defendant's purpose
in bringing that consequence about. Since the defendant desired to kill
the victim, he had the necessary intent to make him guilty of murder,
in spite of his noble motive (i.e., to save the world). B is therefore
incorrect. A person who, by reason of mental illness, is incapable of
understanding the nature and quality of his or her act is insane under
the M'Naghten rule discussed above. The phrase nature and quality
of the act, however, refers to the physical character of the act and to
its  physical  consequences.  Since  the  defendant  understood  that  he
was  pushing  the  victim  down  the  stairs  and  that  this  could  result  in
her  death,  he  did  understand  the  nature  and  quality  of  his  act.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

91.  A  The  Fourth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  protects
against  unreasonable  search  and  seizure.  Ordinarily,  a  warrantless
search is regarded as unreasonable and therefore unlawful under this
clause.  This  constitutional  provision  applies  only  to  searches
conducted by the police or by other government officials,  however.
For this reason, the fact that the administrator was not a government
employee  —  and  was  not  working  in  conjunction  with  any
government  employee  —  would  make  the  Fourth  Amendment

572

protection absolutely inapplicable here.

As to B, there is some Supreme Court support for the proposition that
a  student's  consent  to  an  administrative  search  may  sometimes  be
implied  from 
the  special  relationship  between  students  and
administrators.  But  that  consent  would  be  unlikely  to  extend  to
something as intrusive as a body search (which is what occurred here
when  the  administrator  reached  into  the  defendant's  pocket)  on  only
the weak hearsay evidence that was present here. And, in any event,
this  explanation  is  not  as  good  as  A,  which  resolves  the  issue
automatically. Therefore, B is wrong. Similarly, C's “special concern
for  the  well-being  of  young  people”  rationale  might  support  certain
types  of  searches,  but  it  wouldn't  support  a  body  search  with  the
much-less-than-probable-cause,  hearsay-type  evidence  here.  D  is
incorrect  for  three  reasons:  First,  an  anonymous  note  does  not
ordinarily  give  anyone  probable  cause  to  believe  its  contents,
especially  where  the  note  is  itself  based  on  hearsay;  second,
probable cause does not justify a warrantless search by a government
official; and third, the administrator's search of the defendant did not
violate  his  Fourth  Amendment  rights  even  if  she  did  not  have
probable cause because, as explained in A, the defendant was not a
government actor.

92. B A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to  bring  about  a  criminally  prohibited  result,  he  or  she  comes
substantially  close  to  bringing  about  that  result.  Thus,  while  certain
crimes  may  be  committed  without 
the  prohibited
consequences, criminal attempt always requires the specific intent to
bring  about  the  prohibited  result.  Although  the  employee  could  be
convicted of violating the statute if he actually sold ammunition to the
teenager, he could not be convicted of attempting to violate the statute
unless he knew that the teenager was under the age of 16 and intended
to sell her the ammunition.

intending 

For  obvious  practical  reasons,  there  is  usually  an  irrebuttable
presumption  that  all  persons  know  the  law.  Ignorance  of  the  law,
therefore,  would  not  provide  the  employee  with  a  defense.  A  is
therefore incorrect. The fact that the owner is vicariously liable under
the  statute  would  not  furnish  the  employee  with  a  defense  since  the
statute  imposes  liability  on  both  employee  and  employer.  C  is
incorrect  for  this  reason,  and  because  the  statute  imposes  vicarious

573

liability on the employer only if the employee actually makes a sale,
which  the  employee  did  not  do.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  statute
does not make knowledge or experience an element of guilt.

93. B At common law, murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with
malice  aforethought.  One  state  of  mind  that  constitutes  malice
aforethought  is  the  intent  to  kill  a  human  being.  Since  knowledge  of
the victim's identity is not an essential element of murder, the fact that
the defendant was mistaken about the identity of the person at whom
he was shooting does not prevent him from having the necessary state
of  mind  (i.e.,  intent  to  kill).  For  this  reason,  the  defendant  may  be
convicted  even  without  application  of  the  doctrine  of  transferred
intent.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  defendant
unlawfully killed the victim with the intent to kill a human being and
is therefore guilty of murder. Although a wanton disregard for human
life  may  constitute  malice  aforethought,  mere  negligence  does  not.
Since  the  creation  of  an  unreasonable  risk  is  merely  negligent,  this
fact is not sufficient to justify a finding that the defendant had malice
aforethought,  which  is  necessary  to  a  conviction  for  murder.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

94. C  The  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  provides,  in
part, that “no person shall . . . be subject for the same offense to be
twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” This prevents a defendant from
being  charged  twice  with  the  same  crime.  The  charge  against  the
defendant in the state court involves the violation of a statute that is
different  from  the  one  that  she  was  convicted  of  violating  in  the
federal court, however. The state prosecution is thus not for the same
offense. For this reason, the double jeopardy clause does not require
its  dismissal  even  though  the  same  evidence  will  be  used  in  both
prosecutions.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  criminal  conspiracy  consists  of  an
agreement  between  two  or  more  persons  to  commit  a  crime  and  is
complete when the agreement is made. It is a crime separate from the
substantive crime that the conspirators agreed to commit and does not
merge with that substantive crime. B is incorrect for this reason, and
because  prosecutions  for  violating  state  and  federal  statutes  are  not
for  the  same  offense,  even  though  based  on  a  single  act  by  the
defendant. D  contains  an  incorrect  statement  since  violations  of  the

574

statutes of different sovereigns constitute different offenses; therefore,
separate prosecutions are not barred by the double jeopardy clause.

95.  D  Criminal  battery  consists  of  the  intentional,  reckless,  or  criminally
negligent application of force to the body of another. Since it is thus a
general intent crime, it may be committed without the intent to make
contact with the victim. While voluntary intoxication is no defense to
a general intent crime, involuntary intoxication ordinarily is. A person
has become involuntarily intoxicated when his or her intoxication was
the  result  of  an  unpredictable  and  grossly  excessive  reaction  to  an
intoxicating  substance.  Thus,  if  the  defendant  had  never  before  been
overcome by the alcohol in one drink, it may be that his intoxication
was  involuntary  and  that  it  will  provide  him  with  a  defense  to  the
charge of criminal battery. It is not certain that this defense would be
successful,  since  a  court  might  find  that  although  the  response  was
unpredictable,  it  was  not  grossly  excessive.  The  fact  set  forth  in  D,
however,  is  the  only  one  listed  that  might  possibly  provide  the
defendant with an effective defense.

A  person  may  become  “voluntarily”  intoxicated  even  without  the
intent  to  become  drunk  so  long  as  he  or  she  is  aware  that  the
substance that he or she is taking has an intoxicating potential. Since
the  defendant  was  aware  that  the  drink  had  some  alcohol  in  it,  his
intoxication  may  be  called  voluntary  even  if  he  did  not  intend  to
become drunk. A is therefore incorrect. If the defendant's conduct in
drinking the drink was reckless or criminally negligent, he could have
the  necessary  mens rea  to  be  guilty  of  battery  (i.e.,  general  intent),
even though he did not specifically know what risk he was creating
(i.e., that he would fall off the bar stool). B is therefore incorrect. C
is incorrect because battery is a general intent crime, and therefore it
does not require the intent to make contact with another human being.

96.  A  A  person  is  privileged  by  self-defense  to  use  reasonable  force  to
protect  himself  or  herself  against  what  reasonably  appears  to  be  an
imminent threat of bodily harm. In this connection, reasonable force is
the force that would appear necessary to the reasonable person. Even
deadly force is reasonable if the person using it reasonably believes
that he or she is being threatened with deadly force. Thus, since the
defendant  reasonably  believed  that  his  life  was  in  danger,  the  force
that  he  used  in  self-defense  was  probably  reasonable,  making  the
defendant not guilty of attempted murder.

575

Although  deadly  force  is  not  ordinarily  considered  reasonable  in
defense of mere property, B is incorrect because the defendant's shot
was probably fired in response to a threat against his person and may
have  been  justified  by  self-defense.  Although  the  intent  to  kill  or
inflict serious injury can be inferred from the fact that the defendant
fired at the officer, C is incorrect because, if reasonable, his conduct
was  privileged  by  self-defense.  Since  the  defendant  had  no  way  of
knowing  that  the  person  threatening  him  was  a  police  officer,  the
officer's status as such can have no bearing on the reasonableness of
the defendant's actions. D is therefore incorrect.

97. C One who intentionally aids, abets, or facilitates the commission of a
crime  is  criminally  responsible  for  the  crime  as  an  accomplice.  In
addition,  an  accomplice  is  criminally  responsible  for  all  the
foreseeable consequences of the crime that he or she facilitated. Since
the  use  of  the  defendant's  apartment  to  escape  detection  was  part  of
the  bank  robber's  plan  in  preparing  for  the  robbery,  the  defendant's
agreement to permit the bank robber to use it facilitated the robbery,
making the defendant an accomplice to it. As such, the defendant may
be guilty of felony murder in the death that resulted from the robbery,
but only if it was foreseeable that such a death would occur.

One  who  becomes  an  accessory  after  a  crime  has  been  committed
(i.e., accessory after the fact) by knowingly harboring the person who
committed it is not criminally responsible for prior acts committed by
the  person  harbored.  A  person  who  facilitates  the  commission  of  a
crime  by  agreeing  in  advance  that  he  or  she  will  harbor  the
perpetrator  after  the  crime  is  committed  is  guilty  as  an  accomplice
(i.e.,  accessory  before  the  fact),  however.  As  such,  he  or  she  is
criminally responsible for all foreseeable consequences of the crime
to which he or she was an accomplice. A is therefore incorrect. Since
an accomplice is criminally responsible for those consequences that
were  foreseeable,  the  fact  that  the  defendant  did  not  actually  know
that  the  bank  robber  would  use  a  gun  does  not  protect  him  from
liability  if  the  bank  robber's  use  of  a  gun  was  foreseeable.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  A  conspirator  is  criminally  responsible  for  all
crimes committed by co-conspirators in furtherance of the subject of
the  conspiracy.  D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  an  accessory  is
criminally responsible only for consequences that were foreseeable.

98. C  The  United  States  Constitution  protects  criminal  defendants  against

576

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

unreasonable search and seizure. To give this protection meaning, the
courts  exclude  evidence  obtained  as  the  result  of  an  unreasonable
search.  Not  every  observation  or  inspection  by  police  officers  is
properly classified as a search, however. In general, it is understood
that a search occurs only when the police inspect a place in which the
defendant  has  a  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy.  If  the  field  was
such a place, the overflight and subsequent visit by police constituted
searches,  and,  since  they  were  performed  without  a  warrant,  the
evidence  obtained  as  a  result  of  those  searches  should  be  excluded.
On the other hand, if the field was not a place in which the defendant
had a reasonable expectation of privacy, the overflight and visit were
not searches and the evidence should not be excluded.

A is incorrect because if the defendant had no reasonable expectation
of  privacy,  the  use  of  special  equipment  to  photograph  what  the
police  observed  would  not  be  a  search.  The  United  States
Constitution  provides  that  a  warrant  may  be  issued  only  upon  a
showing  of  probable  cause.  For  this  reason,  a  warrant  obtained
solely on the basis of information received from an informant may be
invalid  unless  the  reliability  of  the  informant  can  be  properly
established. B is incorrect, however, because the warrant in this case
might  have  been  issued  on  the  basis  of  the  police  officers'
observations.  The  constitutional  protection  against  unreasonable
search and seizure prevents the use of evidence obtained directly or
indirectly  as  a  result  of  an  improper  search  (i.e.,  “fruit  of  the
poisonous  tree”).  Thus,  if  the  warrant  was  issued  as  the  result  of
observations  that  the  officers  made  in  violation  of  the  defendant's
constitutional  rights,  the  evidence  will  be  excluded  even  though  it
was  discovered  after  the  warrant  was  issued.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

99. D A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to bring about a result that is criminally prohibited, he or she comes
substantially  close  to  accomplishing  that  result.  Since  the  defendant
believed  that  the  time  was  five  minutes  past  eleven,  and  since  it
would have been lawful to sell liquor at that time, he did not have the
specific intent to bring about a result that was criminally prohibited.
For  this  reason,  he  could  not  be  guilty  of  attempting  to  violate  the
statute.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Attempt  always  requires  specific

577

intent,  even  where  the  substantive  crime  does  not.  Thus,  even  if  the
statute  did  not  require  specific  intent,  the  defendant  could  not  be
guilty of attempting to violate it without specifically intending to sell
liquor after midnight. C is therefore incorrect.

100.  A  At  common  law,  larceny  is  defined  as  a  trespassory  taking  and
carrying off of personal property known to be another's with the intent
to  permanently  deprive  the  owner  thereof.  A  person  who  is
reclaiming his or her own property is not committing larceny since he
or she is not carrying off the property of another. Thus, the defendant's
taking of $50 to pay himself back for the money that the victim owed
him was not a larceny. Except in the case of fungible goods, however,
this rule does not protect a defendant who takes something that is not
his or her own, even though it is equivalent in value to the property
that  he  or  she  seeks  to  reclaim.  Thus,  the  defendant's  taking  of  $50
cash to pay himself for the watch that the victim refused to return is a
larceny.

Since  the  statute  provides  that  a  larceny  of  $50  or  less  is  a
misdemeanor, A is correct, and B, C, and D are incorrect.

101.  A  A  person  has  to  be  the  “cause-in-fact”  of  a  death  in  order  to  be
convicted  for  it.  The  mistress  is  not  a  “but-for”  cause-in-fact  of  the
wife's death since the wife would have died anyway from the poison.
However, a person can meet the cause-in-fact requirement if he or she
is  a  “substantial  factor”  in  causing  the  death.  Here,  the  mistress's
actions significantly sped up the death, so she was a substantial factor
in causing the death. Consequently, she would fulfill the cause-in-fact
requirement and could be found guilty of the murder. Therefore, C and
D are incorrect. B is irrelevant because the fact the mistress was in
the house unlawfully does not change the analysis.

102.  C  A  criminal  conspiracy  is  an  agreement  to  commit  a  crime  and  is
complete when the agreement is made. Since the defendant agreed to
commit a robbery with the two other men, he is guilty of conspiracy.
A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to  bring  about  a  result  that  is  criminally  prohibited,  he  comes
substantially  close  to  bringing  about  that  result.  Since  the  two  other
men  intended  to  rob  the  bank  and  came  substantially  close  to  doing
so,  they  are  guilty  of  attempted  robbery.  Co-conspirators  are
vicariously  liable  for  crimes  committed  in  furtherance  of  the
agreement. Since the attempted robbery was committed in furtherance

578

of  the  agreement  between  the  defendant  and  the  two  other  men,  the
defendant is criminally liable for the attempt even though he did not
physically participate in it.

103. B A warrant authorizing the search of persons must clearly identify the
particular  persons  to  be  searched,  although  it  is  not  necessary  that
they be identified by name. This warrant identified them in terms of a
fact  that  could  not  be  determined  until  they  had  been  searched,
however (i.e., “all persons . . . who are found to be in possession of
unlawful  gambling  records”).  It  therefore  lacked  the  required
particularity. If there was probable cause to arrest a person, a search
performed incident to that arrest would be valid. While it is uncertain
whether a court would find that there was probable cause to arrest the
defendant, B is the only answer listed that could possibly be correct.

Probable  cause  means  that  facts  are  known  that  would  lead  the
reasonable person to believe that a crime was being committed. If the
reasonable person would believe that gambling activities were being
conducted  in  the  tavern,  he  or  she  would  certainly  be  justified  in
believing that some of the people present were engaging in them. A is
therefore  incorrect.  Although  a  warrant  that  authorizes  the  search  of
premises  may  also  authorize  the  search  of  persons  present  on  said
premises,  C  is  incorrect  because  this  warrant  does  not  identify  the
people  to  be  searched  with  sufficient  particularity.  D  is  incorrect
because  if  corroboration  is  required,  it  must  exist  prior  to  the
issuance of the warrant, not after its execution.

104. D Some courts say that statutory rape is a strict liability crime, requiring
no  intent  at  all;  other  courts  say  that  it  is  a  general  intent  crime
requiring  only  the  intent  to  have  sexual  intercourse.  Under  either
view, this means that a defendant who has sexual intercourse with a
female who is too young to consent is guilty if he was aware that he
was engaging in intercourse. This is so even though he did not know
that she was underage, even though the reasonable person would not
have known it, and even though she told him that she was over the age
of consent.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

105.  D  Under  the  state's  definition,  conspiracy  requires  an  agreement  to
commit a crime with the specific intent to commit a crime. If the act
that the first boy and the girl agreed to commit was not a crime, the

579

first boy lacked the specific intent required. Since neither the common
law  nor  the  statute  prohibits  sexual  intercourse  between  persons  of
the second boy's and the girl's ages, intercourse between them would
not have been a crime, and therefore the agreement between the first
boy and the girl was not a conspiracy.

For  certain  crimes,  Wharton's  Rule  provides  that  there  can  be  no
conviction  for  conspiracy  unless  one  of  the  parties  to  the  agreement
was  not  logically  essential  to  the  commission  of  the  act  that  they
agreed to commit. A is incorrect, however, because although the girl's
participation was essential to the seduction of the second boy, the first
boy's  participation  was  not.  In  addition,  Wharton's  Rule  does  not
apply  to  statutory  rape.  Conspiracy  is  a  separate  crime  and  is
committed  when  the  conspiratorial  agreement  is  made.  Some
jurisdictions  also  require  that  there  have  been  an  overt  act  in
furtherance of the conspiracy. B is incorrect, however, because such
an act need only be committed by one of the co-conspirators, and the
girl's  acts  would  suffice.  Since  the  crime  is  committed  when  the
agreement  is  made,  the  fact  that  the  act  that  the  parties  agreed  to
commit never actually took place is not a defense. C is thus incorrect.

106.  D  A  lesser  included  offense  is  an  offense  the  elements  of  which  are
completely  included  among  the  elements  of  a  more  serious  crime.
Attempting  to  commit  a  crime  is  always  a  lesser  included  offense
since  its  elements  are  always  included  among  the  elements  of  the
completed  crime.  One  who  commits  a  crime  is  guilty  of  all  lesser
included offenses. Since the defendant offered to commit bribery, he
is  guilty  of  bribery  in  the  second  degree,  and  since  the  attempt  is
included in the completed crime, he is guilty of attempting to commit
bribery in the second degree.

A  person  is  guilty  of  attempting  to  commit  a  crime  when,  with  the
specific  intent  to  commit  that  crime,  he  or  she  comes  substantially
close to committing it. A  is  incorrect  because  bribery  in  the  second
degree is not an “attempt” crime. It is statutorily defined as offering to
commit  bribery  and  is  committed  when  the  offer  is  made.  B  is
incorrect because although the clerk first offered to accept the money,
the  defendant's  subsequent  agreement  was  also  an  offer  to  pay  the
money.  In  addition,  the  defendant's  trip  to  the  clerk's  office  the
following day was for the purpose of offering to pay the money. C is
based  on  a  misinterpretation  of  the  law.  A  lesser  included  crime  is

580

said to “merge” with the more serious one, but this means only that a
defendant cannot be convicted of both. There is no reason why he or
she cannot be convicted of the lesser one only.

107. C A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to bring about a prohibited result, he or she comes substantially close
to  doing  so.  Thus,  all  attempts  are  “specific  intent”  crimes.  This
means that although murder does not require a specific intent to cause
the death of a person, attempted murder does. Since the defendant did
not  intend  to  cause  the  death  of  a  human  being,  she  lacks  the  intent
required to make her guilty of attempted murder.

A is therefore incorrect. The death of the friend does not satisfy the
specific  intent  requirement  unless  the  defendant  intended  to  bring  it
about.  For  this  reason,  B  is  also  incorrect.  Although  the  attempt  to
murder a person may merge with the actual murder of the person, D is
incorrect  because  the  coworker  did  not  die  and  so  could  not  have
been murdered.

108. A  A  criminal  suspect  may  not  be  interrogated  in  the  absence  of  his  or
her attorney once formal charges have been brought. It has been held
that  placing  a  secret  police  agent  to  elicit  incriminating  statements
violates this rule, even though the officer asks no questions.

B  is  incorrect  because  “entrapment”  refers  only  to  conduct  by  a
police officer that induced the defendant to commit a crime that he or
she  was  not  otherwise  inclined  to  commit.  C  is  incorrect  because  a
warrant  does  not  justify  a  police  interrogation  in  violation  of  the
above rule. D is incorrect because even a voluntary statement violates
the above rule if made as a result of a police interrogation conducted
without the presence or consent of the defendant's attorney.

109.  A  Murder  is  the  unjustified  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought.  Malice  aforethought  includes  the  intent  to  kill,  which
means  the  desire  or  knowledge  that  the  defendant's  act  will  bring
about the death of another person. Since the other boy threw away the
victim's medicine with the desire that doing so would bring about the
death of the victim, and since the victim died as a result, the victim
was  murdered.  A  criminal  conspiracy  is  an  agreement  to  commit  a
crime.  Since  the  two  boys  agreed  to  kill  the  victim,  they  were
involved  in  a  criminal  conspiracy.  Co-conspirators  are  vicariously
liable  for  any  crimes  committed  in  furtherance  of  the  conspiracy.

581

Since  the  murder  of  the  victim  was  committed  by  the  other  boy  in
furtherance of his agreement with the boy who ran away, the boy who
ran away is vicariously liable for it. A is therefore correct.

Since the boy who ran away did no physical act that enabled the other
boy  to  bring  about  the  victim's  death,  he  did  not  aid  or  abet  him  in
bringing it about. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because the
principle  of  vicarious  liability  as  explained  above  makes  it
unnecessary for the boy who ran away to physically participate in the
commission  of  the  crime  with  which  he  is  charged.  One  who
effectively  withdraws  from  a  conspiracy  before 
is
accomplished  may  avoid  vicarious  guilt  for  the  substantive  crime,
although  not  for  the  crime  of  conspiracy.  For  a  withdrawal  to  be
effective,  however,  the  withdrawing  conspirator  must  at  least  do
something that places his or her co-conspirator on notice of his or her
withdrawal.  Since  the  boy  who  ran  away  did  not  do  so,  he  has  not
effectively withdrawn from the conspiracy, and D is incorrect.

its  goal 

110. A The felony-murder rule provides that the intent to commit a felony is
malice aforethought, and that a death that results from the perpetration
of a felony is therefore murder. For this purpose, the perpetration of a
felony continues during the defendant's attempt to escape to a place of
seeming  safety.  The  pedestrian's  death  thus  occurred  during  the
perpetration  of  a  robbery,  and  the  defendant  could  be  convicted  of
murder even if he was driving carefully at the time it occurred.

B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

111. D  In  the  absence  of  special  circumstances,  no  person  is  under  a  legal
duty  to  render  aid  to  another.  Since  a  failure  to  act  can  lead  to
criminal  responsibility  only  in  the  face  of  a  duty  to  act,  the  adult's
failure to rescue the girl was not a crime.

This is true even though she could have saved the girl without risk to
herself, even though she knew that there was no one else who could
rescue the child, and even if she was related to the girl. A, B, and C
are therefore incorrect.

112. A Since the statute requires intent, and since the defendant did not intend
the  man's  death,  she  is  not  guilty  of  first  degree  murder  under  the
statute.

B is incorrect because once the man was asleep (and certainly once
he  was  tied  to  the  bed),  the  defendant  was  no  longer  in  danger  and

582

therefore  not  privileged  to  use  force  in  self-defense.  Although  some
first  degree  murder  statutes  include  deaths  resulting  from  the
commission of dangerous felonies, this particular statute does not. C
is therefore incorrect. Many first degree murder statutes include death
resulting from torture, but this one does not. D is therefore incorrect.

113. B At common law, larceny is defined as intentionally taking and carrying
off  the  personal  property  of  another  with  the  intent  to  permanently
deprive the owner of it. Since the defendant planned to return the pen
to the professor in a week or two, she lacked the intent to permanently
deprive him of it.

A  is  incorrect  because  if  she  had  the  requisite  intent  at  the  time  she
took the pen, the fact that it was later taken from her would not undo
the crime that she had already committed. C is incorrect because the
defendant lacked the requisite intent. There are no facts justifying the
inference on which D is based, but even if there were, the defendant's
taking  would  not  be  a  larceny  unless  she  intended  (i.e.,  was
substantially  certain)  that  the  professor  would  be  permanently
deprived of the pen.

114.  B  Robbery  is  larceny  accomplished  by  physical  force  or  threat.  The
defendant  clearly  committed  a  larceny.  Although  he  acquired
possession and carried off the briefcase without the use of force, the
issue is whether his subsequent use of force to retain possession was
sufficient to make him guilty of robbery. B is the only case in which
this issue arose.

In A,  no  force  was  used  after  acquisition  of  the  purse.  In  C  and  D,
although force was used to acquire the stolen property, none was used
thereafter.

115. B  One  who  incites  and  encourages  another  to  commit  a  crime  may  be
guilty  as  an  accomplice  or  accessory,  especially  when  he  or  she
derives  some  direct  benefit  from  the  crime.  Since  the  coworker
demanded  $25  to  cover  up  the  cashier's  crime  while  they  were
standing  in  front  of  the  open  safe  and  then  watched  as  the  cashier
reached into the safe and handed it to him, he can be found guilty as
an accessory to larceny.

Robbery  is  larceny  committed  by  force  or  threat  of  force.  A  is
incorrect because the threat that the coworker made was not of force.
Embezzlement is the fraudulent taking of property that is lawfully in

583

the defendant's possession. Since the $25 that the coworker took from
the  cashier  was  not  lawfully  in  the  coworker's  possession  to  begin
with,  he  did  not  embezzle  it.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  Crimes
characterized by the term fraud involve takings that are committed by
making  misrepresentations  that  induce  the  owner  to  willingly  part
with  possession  or  title.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  owner  of  the
supermarket was not induced to part with the money by reliance on a
misrepresentation.

116.  C  Vicarious  liability  refers  to  responsibility  that  is  imposed  on  one
person  for  a  crime  committed  by  another.  If  the  bartender  was  not
guilty of violating the statute, there has been no crime for which the
owner  can  be  held  vicariously  liable.  Although  it  is  not  certain  that
this  argument  will  succeed,  it  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could
possibly support the owner's defense.

A is incorrect because when vicarious liability is imposed, the fault
(or lack of fault) of the person on whom it is imposed is irrelevant. B
is similarly incorrect because vicarious liability may be imposed for
the  crime  committed  by  an  agent  even  though  the  agent  violated
specific  instructions  in  committing  it.  D  is  incorrect  because  a
bartender  selling  drinks  to  a  bar  customer  is  acting  in  the  scope  of
employment, since his or her conduct is designed to benefit his or her
employer  and  since  he  or  she  is  subject  to  the  employer's  right  of
control while doing so.

117. D  In  nearly  all  states,  the  defendant  is  liable  for  murder  if  he  or  she
causes  a  death  while  acting  with  a  “depraved  heart”  or  an  extreme
indifference  to  the  value  of  human  life.  For  depraved-heart  murder,
the  risk  of  death  or  serious  bodily  injury  has  to  be  so  great  that  the
defendant  can  be  said  to  act  with  great  recklessness.  Importantly,
negligence or even gross negligence won't suffice. Here, hunting deer
in a “densely populated suburban neighborhood” is likely so reckless
as to reach the level required for depraved-heart murder.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

118. C Kidnapping is the intentional asportation and confinement of a person
against  the  person's  will  by  means  of  force  or  threat  and  without
lawful  authority.  Although 
the  defendant
intentionally confined the bank manager against his will by means of
force and threat and without lawful authority, there is some question

is  obvious 

that 

it 

584

as to whether there was an asportation. Ordinarily, any moving of the
victim  satisfies  the  requirement  of  asportation.  Many  jurisdictions
now hold, however, that there is no asportation if the movement of the
victim  was  incidental  to  and  a  necessary  part  of  the  commission  of
some  other  substantive  crime.  Although  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court
would accept that view, the argument in C is the only one listed that
could possibly support the defendant's defense.

In some jurisdictions, a ransom demand makes the defendant guilty of
a  more  serious  degree  of  the  crime,  but  no  jurisdiction  requires  a
ransom demand as an essential element of kidnapping. A is therefore
incorrect. B is incorrect because, once committed, a crime cannot be
uncommitted. D is incorrect because the crime of kidnapping can be
committed against an adult as well as a child.

119. C The search of the other house was unlawful because the officers did
not  have  a  warrant  and  no  exception  to  the  warrant  requirement
applied.

Under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement,
police may enter a home without a search warrant to prevent harm to
persons,  prevent  the  imminent  destruction  of  evidence,  or  while  in
pursuit  of  a  suspect.  Here,  although  the  ex-husband  warned  the
officers  that  the  woman  would  be  coming  home  soon  and  could
destroy the evidence, there was no indication that the officers did not
have time to secure a warrant before the woman came home or that it
was likely the evidence was in imminent danger of being destroyed.
A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Under  the  consent  exception,  if  officers
receive  valid  consent  to  search  a  home,  they  do  not  need  a  search
warrant. Here, the ex-husband didn't actually tell the officers they had
permission to search the other house. In addition, even if he had given
permission,  there  was  no  indication  that  the  ex-husband  had  any
authority to consent to a search of his ex-wife's house. B is therefore
incorrect.  “Fruit  of  the  poisonous  tree”  refers  to  the  doctrine  that
illegally  obtained  evidence  cannot  be  used  for  the  purpose  of
obtaining  other  evidence.  Here,  the  officers  had  a  warrant  for  the
woman's  original  home.  Consequently,  there  is  no  issue  with  the
evidence  obtained  during  the  first  search,  and  the  “fruit  of  the
poisonous tree” doctrine would not apply. D is therefore incorrect.

120. C  Unless  a  defendant  was  ready,  willing,  and  able  to  give  affirmative
assistance  in  the  commission  of  the  crime,  his  or  her  presence  and

585

silent acquiescence are not sufficient to result in criminal liability.

Ordinarily,  one  is  not  under  any  obligation  to  attempt  to  prevent  a
crime from being committed. A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect
because,  even  with  criminal  intent,  mere  presence  at  the  scene  of  a
crime  is  not  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  requirement  of  actus  reus.  The
defendant  was  not  an  accessory  at  all  since  her  presence  was  not
sufficient participation, but in any event, she could not have been an
accessory  after  the  fact  since  the  crime  was  committed  after  her
involvement began. D is therefore incorrect.

121. C Since one purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police officers
from  violating  the  Fourth  Amendment,  information  obtained  as  a
result of an unlawful search may not be used to justify the issuance of
a warrant authorizing further search.

Such  a  warrant  is  invalid,  and  anything  found  pursuant  to  it  is
excluded  as  one  of  the  fruits  of  the  original  unlawful  search.  A  is
therefore incorrect. B is incorrect for the same reason, even though it
seems  sound.  Although  possession  of  stolen  items  is  not  in  itself
sufficient to permit the conclusion that the possessor was the thief, it
is certainly acceptable as circumstantial evidence to be considered by
a jury. D is therefore incorrect.

122. D Robbery is a larceny that is committed by force or threat to use force
against the lawful possessor of the property taken or any other person.
If  the  collector  gave  the  defendant  $1,000  because  he  knowingly
threatened to injure the daughter if she did not, his taking of the money
was robbery. Although he did not know that the daughter was in the
car when he first made the threat, it could be found that the threat was
continued by his conduct. Thus, if he knew that the daughter was in the
car  when  he  received  the  money  from  the  collector,  it  might  be
concluded that he obtained the money by a threat to burn the daughter,
not just the car.

A is incorrect for two reasons: First, he did not take the car by force,
and second, he is charged with robbery of the cash, not of the car. B
would  not  make  him  guilty  of  robbery  unless  he  knew  that  the
daughter was in the car when he threatened to burn it. C is incorrect
since  in  most  jurisdictions,  robbery  requires  that  the  threat  be
directed against a person.

123.  C  Statements  obtained  from  a  suspect  in  violation  of  his  or  her

586

constitutional rights (and, some authorities suggest, the fruits of such
statements) cannot be used against him or her. Only the person from
whom the statement was obtained, however, has standing to assert the
constitutional  violation.  Since  the  interrogation  of  the  man  did  not
violate  the  defendant's  rights,  the  defendant  lacks  the  necessary
standing to assert its unconstitutionality.

A and B  are  incorrect  because  there  are  no  facts  indicating  that  the
defendant's complicity would have been discovered without the man's
statement.  Since  the  interrogation  of  the  man  did  not  violate  the
constitutional  rights  of  the  defendant,  it  does  not  matter  whether  the
defendant  was  in  custody  at  the  time  it  took  place.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

124. D A defendant may be liable for involuntary manslaughter if his or her
conduct results in the accidental death of another person. Involuntary
manslaughter is particularly applicable to cases where the defendant
causes  a  drunk-driving  accident  that  kills  someone.  As  long  as  the
intoxication  was  a  significant  contributing  factor  to  the  accident,  the
defendant  is  almost  certainly  guilty  of  involuntary  manslaughter.
Importantly,  most  states  require  only  a  mental  state  of  gross
negligence, and driving while drunk constitutes recklessness (a higher
mental  state  than  gross  negligence).  Additionally,  in  a  jurisdiction
applying  the  misdemeanor-manslaughter  rule,  drunk  driving  will  at
least  be  a  misdemeanor.  Here,  since  defendant's  drunk  driving
constituted  recklessness  and  his  intoxication  proximately  caused  the
crime by leading to his mistaken belief that he was being chased, the
defendant  is  guilty  of  involuntary  manslaughter.  The  fact  that  the
victim  may  have  been  contributorily  negligent  is  not  a  defense  to
involuntary  manslaughter.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect
because  involuntary  manslaughter  does  not  require  the  defendant  to
intend  to  cause  the  death  of  the  victim.  C  is  incorrect  because  his
belief that he was being chased would not provide a defense for the
defendant.

125. C Felony murder is a foreseeable killing that occurs during the course of
a felony. In the majority of states, a person cannot be found guilty of
felony murder for the death of a co-felon if that co-felon is killed by
the  police.  Here,  since  the  defendant's  friend  was  shot  by  a  police
officer,  it  is  unlikely  he  would  be  found  guilty  of  felony  murder.
Therefore, A and B are incorrect.

587

D is incorrect because a death that occurs while fleeing the scene still
meets  the  requirements  of  felony  murder,  whether  or  not  the  felony
itself is technically completed.

126.  A  Criminal  battery  consists  of  the  intentional,  reckless,  or  criminally
negligent application of force to the body of another. The defendant's
act  of  shooting  through  the  ceiling  into  an  apartment  in  which  she
knew  there  were  people  probably  was  at  least  criminally  negligent,
and so it probably constituted a battery.

A  person  is  guilty  of  attempting  to  commit  a  crime  when,  with  the
specific intent to bring about a criminally proscribed result, he or she
comes  substantially  close  to  accomplishing  that  result.  Since
involuntary  manslaughter  is  an  unintended  homicide,  no  person  can
have the specific intent to commit it. Thus, there can be no attempt to
commit  it,  and  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Attempted  murder  and
attempted voluntary manslaughter both require an intent to kill. Since
the defendant did not intend to strike anyone with the bullet, C and D
are incorrect.

127. D A person is privileged to use reasonable force to protect himself or
herself  from  what  he  or  she  reasonably  believes  to  be  a  threat  of
imminent bodily harm. Since the friend fired a pistol at the defendant
and  was  (or  appeared  to  be)  capable  of  firing  it  again,  it  was
reasonable  for  the  defendant  to  believe  herself  threatened  with
imminent  bodily  harm  and  was  probably  reasonable  for  her  to
respond with deadly force.

If the friend's belief that the defendant was about to shoot her was a
reasonable one, the friend's use of force may have been privileged. A
is incorrect, however, because although an aggressor has no right of
self-defense  against  a  reasonable  response  to  his  or  her  initial
aggression,  the  defendant  committed  no  act  of  aggression  until  after
the  friend  fired  at  her.  Self-defense  may  privilege  the  use  of  deadly
force  in  response  to  what  is  reasonably  perceived  as  deadly  force.
Even though the force used by the friend had not yet caused death or
serious  injury,  it  was  capable  of  doing  so,  and  can  therefore  be
regarded  as  deadly  force.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect
because  even  a  premeditated  killing  may  be  privileged  by  self-
defense.

128.  D  At  common  law,  arson  was  defined  as  the  intentional  burning  of

588

another's  dwelling.  Under  the  statute  given,  the  definition  includes
buildings other than dwellings as well. Since the men desired to burn
down the factory, they had the necessary intent. Since they succeeded
in  doing  so,  they  are  guilty  of  arson.  Conspiracy  consists  of  an
agreement to commit a crime. Since the men agreed to commit arson,
they  are  guilty  of  conspiracy.  Conspiracy  does  not  merge  with  the
substantive  crime  and  may  be  the  basis  of  separate  prosecution  and
conviction. D is therefore correct.

129. C Robbery is a larceny where the property is taken from the person or
presence  of  the  owner,  and  the  taking  is  accomplished  by  force  or
threat.  Importantly,  a  larceny  is  the  trespassory  taking  and  carrying
away  of  the  personal  property  of  another  with  intent  to  steal.
Consequently, if the defendant is reclaiming his or her own property,
then the defendant is not committing robbery. This is true even if the
defendant  honestly  but  unreasonably  believes  that  what  he  or  she  is
taking  is  his  or  her  own  property.  Here,  the  defendant  has  not
committed larceny because he is taking back “his” own property, not
property of another.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

130. C Larceny is a trespassory taking and carrying off of personal property
known  to  be  another's  with  the  intent  to  permanently  deprive  the
owner.  Since  the  defendant  did  not  physically  move  the  couch,  she
may  successfully  argue  that  because  there  was  no  asportation  (i.e.,
carrying off), there was no larceny.

It is sometimes argued that one who enters through an unlocked door
committed no breaking and, therefore, is not guilty of burglary. A  is
incorrect, however, because breaking is not an element of larceny. If a
defendant  carried  off  personal  property  that  actually  was  his  or  her
own, he or she could not be guilty of larceny because he or she did
not take the property of another. If he or she mistakenly believed that
it was his or her own, he or she still would not be guilty of larceny
because  he  or  she  did  not  carry  off  property  known  to  be  another's.
The couch was not the defendant's, however, and she knew that it was
not hers. The fact that it was equal in value to her stereo would not,
therefore, justify her taking or carrying it off. B is therefore incorrect.
A  person  who  takes  and  carries  off  personal  property  known  to  be
another's  with  the  intent  to  permanently  deprive  is  guilty  of  larceny
without  regard  to  whether  or  not  he  or  she  intended  to  benefit  by

589

doing so. D is therefore incorrect.

131. A Some cases have held that the imposition of a prison term on the basis
of  vicarious  liability  for  a  strict-liability  crime  committed  by  a
defendant's  employee  is  a  violation  of  due  process.  It  is  generally
understood,  however,  that  the  imposition  of  a  fine  on  this  basis  is
this  statute  makes  an  employer
constitutionally  valid.  Since 
vicariously  liable  for  the  payment  of  a  fine  if  an  employee  sells
ammunition  to  a  minor,  and  since  the  owner's  employee  sold
ammunition to a minor, the owner may be convicted.

B and C  are  incorrect  because  of  the  specific  language  of  the  given
statute:  B  because  the  statute  imposes  strict  liability  and  does  not
make  negligence  or  unreasonable  behavior  a  basis  of  guilt,  and  C
because the statute does not make the employer's presence an element
of guilt. D is incorrect because it is over-inclusive: There are many
situations  in  which  criminal  law  may  validly  impose  vicarious
liability for the crime of another (e.g., co-conspirators are vicariously
liable  for  each  other's  crimes  committed  in  furtherance  of  the
conspiracy).

132.  D  One  of  the  elements  of  every  crime  is  the  actus  reus,  or  the
requirement  that  the  defendant's  conduct  be  a  voluntary  act.  If  a
defendant acts reflexively or while in a state of unconsciousness, his
or her actions do not fulfill the actus reus requirement and he or she
will  not  be  held  criminally  liable.  Here,  the  toxic  gas  caused  the
woman to lose voluntary control of her arms or legs, and she had no
control  over  them  when  she  punched  the  man.  Consequently,  she
cannot be held criminally liable for his death.

Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.

133. D  A  conspiracy  is  an  agreement  by  two  or  more  persons  to  commit  a
crime. Ordinarily, one who agrees to furnish services to another that
the  other  will  use  in  committing  a  crime  is  not  guilty  of  conspiracy
merely  because  he  or  she  knows  the  purpose  to  which  the  services
will be put. Where, however, the supplier has a stake in the criminal
enterprise,  his  or  her  agreement  to  furnish  services  may  constitute  a
conspiracy  to  commit  the  crime.  Since  the  defendant  knew  that  the
bank robber would be using his apartment as a hideout following the
robbery,  and  since  the  bank  robber's  promise  to  compensate  the
defendant by paying him a percentage of the loot gave the defendant a

590

stake  in  the  criminal  enterprise,  the  defendant  may  be  guilty  of
conspiracy.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the
defendant's agreement probably was per se unlawful, since he knew
that  the  bank  robber  would  be  hiding  in  his  apartment  to  escape
detection (i.e.,  that  he  would  be  harboring  a  felon),  and  second,  the
defendant had a personal stake in the bank robber's crime. The crime
of  conspiracy  to  commit  robbery  is  complete  when  the  defendant
agrees  with  another  to  commit  the  robbery,  and  is  a  separate  crime
from  the  robbery  itself.  Thus,  the  fact  that  a  defendant  is  guilty  of
robbery  is  not  relevant  to  the  issue  of  whether  he  or  she  conspired
(i.e., agreed) to commit it. For this reason, C is incorrect.

134. A  Once  a  criminal  defendant  has  asserted  his  or  her  right  to  have  an
attorney  present,  further  interrogation  in  the  absence  of  the  attorney
makes  any  incriminating  statements  by  the  defendant  inadmissible.
Since  the  defendant  was  questioned  after  asserting  his  right  to
counsel,  the  statement  that  he  made  in  response  to  that  questioning
should be excluded.

B and C are therefore incorrect. Even after asserting his or her right
to counsel, a defendant may waive that right by making incriminating
statements  during  a  discussion  that  the  defendant  initiates.  Since  the
defendant's  statement  was  made  in  response  to  a  question  by  the
police officer, however, it does not constitute a waiver of his rights
and is therefore inadmissible. D is therefore incorrect.

135. D Conspiracy occurs when two or more people with the specific intent
to commit a crime agree to commit it. Here, since the doctor did not
think  the  wife  would  die,  he  did  not  really  agree  to  commit  murder.
Consequently, there was no conspiracy.

A is incorrect because even if the man believed the pills were deadly
poison, he'd still have to reach an agreement to commit a crime with
someone else in order to be prosecuted for conspiracy. Here, no one
actually  agreed  to  help  him  kill  his  wife.  B  and  C  are  incorrect
because  the  crime  of  conspiracy  is  complete  when  the  unlawful
agreement is made. The success or failure of the substantive crime the
parties agree to do is irrelevant.

136. A  The  Fifth  Amendment  protects  a  defendant  from  being  coerced  into
answering police questions. Police must give Miranda warnings to a

591

person  in  custody  before  questioning  him  or  her.  If  the  person  in
custody then asserts his or her right to have an attorney present during
questioning,  all  interrogation  must  stop  until  the  attorney  arrives  or
the person gives a valid waiver. Here, while the woman received her
Miranda  warnings,  her  attorney  was  not  present  and  she  had  not
waived  her  rights  before  officers  started  questioning  her  about  the
robbery. Because police interrogation is coercive, a confession given
under the circumstances here would not be admissible. Therefore D is
incorrect.

B is incorrect because officers are only required to advise a person in
custody  of  his  or  her  rights.  Officers  are  not  required  to  tell  the
person about their suspicions. C is incorrect because the issue here is
that  the  officers  continued  to  question  her  after  giving  her  Miranda
warnings.

137.  A  Murder  is  the  unlawful  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought. Malice aforethought may consist of intent to cause great
bodily harm. A defendant has intent to cause great bodily harm when
he  or  she  desires  or  knows  that  his  or  her  act  will  result  in  serious
injury. Here, by hitting the victim as hard as he could in the head with
a metal bat, the defendant at least knew his act was going to result in
serious  injury.  Voluntary  manslaughter  is  the  unlawful  killing  of  a
human being with the intent to cause death or great bodily harm, but
under  circumstances  where  the  defendant  is  suffering  from  great
emotional  distress  or  mistaken  justification.  B  is  incorrect  because
having  a  strike  called  on  a  person  during  a  baseball  game  does  not
result in great emotional distress or mistaken justification sufficient to
reduce  murder  to  voluntary  manslaughter.  Involuntary  manslaughter
occurs when the defendant's behavior is grossly negligent and results
in the accidental death of another person. C is incorrect because the
defendant intended to hit the victim with the bat. Battery is where the
defendant  intentionally  or  recklessly  causes  either  bodily  injury  or
offensive touching. D is incorrect because the defendant's actions are
sufficient  to  result  in  the  defendant  being  found  guilty  of  murder,  a
much more serious crime.

138. A Accomplice liability means that one who aids, abets, encourages, or
assists another to perform a crime will himself or herself be liable for
that crime. Importantly, if a defendant's words encourage or approve
of  the  crime,  and  thereby  assist  commission  of  the  crime,  then  the

592

speaker is liable even if he or she did not take any physical acts. The
defendant  is  an  accomplice  to  the  killing  of  the  victim  and  is
consequently  guilty  of  murder.  This  is  because  the  defendant
encouraged the man in the man's commission of the murder. The fact
that  the  defendant's  involvement  consisted  of  words  alone  doesn't
lessen  his  liability.  B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because the defendant's actions encouraged the man to kill the victim,
whether  or  not  the  defendant  truly  intended  that  the  man  kill  the
victim.

139.  C  Under  the  common  law,  a  criminal  conspiracy  is  an  agreement
between  two  or  more  persons  to  commit  a  crime.  Without  such  an
agreement, there can be no conspiracy. Since neither officer actually
intended  to  commit  a  crime,  the  defendant  never  made  such  an
agreement  with  either  of  them,  even  though  he  believed  he  did.  For
this reason, he cannot be guilty of conspiracy.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

140. A The impossibility defense can be raised where the defendant has done
everything  in  his  or  her  power  to  accomplish  a  crime,  but,  due  to
other  circumstances,  no  substantive  crime  has  been  committed.  A
factual  impossibility  arises  out  of  a  defendant's  mistake  of  fact.  The
factual impossibility defense is always unsuccessful today. Here, the
fact  that  the  business  rival  was  already  dead  before  the  hitman  shot
him made it factually impossible to murder him, but it does not supply
the  hitman  with  a  defense  against  attempted  murder.  Under  the
principles  of  accomplice  liability,  since  the  defendant  aided  and
encouraged  the  hitman  to  kill  the  business  rival  by  hiring  him,  the
defendant is liable for any crime the hitman committed at his urging as
long as he had the requisite intent for that crime. Here, the defendant
had  the  requisite  intent  for  attempted  murder  because  he  wanted  the
business  rival  killed.  Since  the  hitman  cannot  defend  himself  by
claiming  factual  impossibility,  the  defendant  cannot  either.  D  is
therefore incorrect. B is incorrect because accomplice liability does
not require the defendant to be physically present at the scene of the
crime. C is incorrect because withdrawal is only effective when the
defendant  has  in  some  sense  undone  the  effects  of  his  or  her
assistance  and  encouragement.  Here,  the  hitman  didn't  receive  the
message until after the crime was committed.

EVIDENCE QUESTIONS

1. The defendant operated a chain of fast food restaurants that specialized
in fried fish. The defendant entered into a valid written contract with
the plaintiff for the purchase of “6,000 pounds of frozen fish filets of
frying quality,” to be delivered by the plaintiff over a period of six
months. One week after the plaintiff made its first delivery pursuant to
the contract, however, the defendant notified the plaintiff that the
product delivered was unacceptable because the filets delivered
weighed only eight ounces each, and that they were cut from Grade B
fish. The plaintiff subsequently brought an action against the defendant
for breach of contract. At the trial of that action, the plaintiff offered
the testimony of a chef. The chef testified that he was the head chef at a
leading hotel, that he was an expert on the preparation of fried fish in
fast food restaurants, and that he had been employed as a chef in fine
restaurants for more than 30 years. He testified further that in that time,

597

he had purchased large quantities of fish on numerous occasions and
was familiar with the terminology used in the wholesale fish industry.
The chef stated that when the phrase “fish filets of frying quality” is
used in the wholesale fish business, it means boneless pieces from six
to nine ounces in weight and cut from Grade A or B fish. For the
purposes of the trial, the parties specifically agreed to be bound by the
terminology of the wholesale fish industry. Upon proper objection by
the defendant's attorney, the chef's testimony as to the meaning of the
phrase should be

(A) admitted as evidence of trade terminology.

(B) admitted, because the chef is an expert on the preparation of fried

fish in fast food restaurants.

(C) admitted, because the parties specifically agreed to be bound by the

terminology of the wholesale fish industry.

(D) excluded, since it is an opinion.

2. While visiting the United States from a Central American republic, the
plaintiff purchased a sweater at a department store and paid for it at the
appropriate cash register. In ringing up the sale, however, the store
employee neglected to remove a security tag that was still affixed to
the sweater to prevent theft. As a result, the tag caused an electronic
security alarm to ring as the plaintiff attempted to exit the store with the
purchased merchandise. Security guards immediately accosted her and
placed her under citizen's arrest. Eventually, the police were called,
and a more thorough investigation was instituted. As a result, it was
determined that the plaintiff had paid for the merchandise. Authorities
of the department store apologized to the plaintiff and permitted her to
leave.

Subsequently, a magazine erroneously reported that the plaintiff had
been arrested, charged with shoplifting at the department store, and
taken into police custody. Because the plaintiff was a candidate for
political office in the Central American republic, newspapers in that
country reprinted the magazine article. The plaintiff lost the election,
and she instituted an action against the magazine for damages resulting
from defamation. At the trial of the plaintiff's action, the magazine
called as a witness a man who resided in the republic, who testified
that he was familiar with the plaintiff's reputation in that country. He
stated that, in the republic, the plaintiff was generally known as a

598

thieving and corrupt politician. If the plaintiff's attorney moves to
strike that testimony, the motion should be

(A) granted, since reputation evidence is not admissible for the purpose

of establishing a party's conduct at any particular time.

(B) granted, since evidence of a party's character is admissible only in

criminal cases.

(C) denied, since evidence of the plaintiff's reputation is relevant to her

claim for damage resulting from defamation.

(D) denied, since the evidence is relevant to the truth or falsity of the

statements made in the magazine article.

3. At the trial of an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for breach
of contract, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to deliver
3,000 filters as agreed. The plaintiff asserted further that, as a result, it
was required to purchase filters on the open market at a price
substantially higher than that agreed upon in its contract with the
defendant. As part of its case, the plaintiff offered the testimony of the
witness, who stated that she was the plaintiff's purchasing agent. She
said that when the defendant breached its contract with the plaintiff,
she had been assigned to purchase filters elsewhere. In answer to a
question, she said, “I recall buying 3,000 filters at a price of $23 per
hundred.” The plaintiff's attorney then showed her a paper that the
witness identified as a photocopy that she personally had made of the
plaintiff's file on that purchase, explaining that the original was kept in
the plaintiff's home office, which was located in another state. Upon
objection by the defendant's attorney, which of the following should the
court admit into evidence?

(A) The witness's testimony as to her recollection of the purchase

price.

(B) The copy that the witness authenticated.

(C) The witness's testimony as to her recollection of the purchase price,

and the copy that the witness authenticated.

(D) Neither the witness's testimony as to her recollection, nor the

authenticated copy.

4. A city newspaper printed an article claiming that a local university
president was a “horrible racist” who “looked down on minority
groups and would prefer not to have any at the university.” The

599

university president filed suit for defamation. During the university
president's presentation of the case, he sought to put the mayor on the
stand. The mayor was prepared to testify that when he asked the
university president for a personal donation to help city relief services
during a recent flood, the university president wrote a large check from
his own account. Since several substantially minority neighborhoods
were flooded along with other neighborhoods in the city, the check
helped many minority citizens. The newspaper's lawyer objected.

How should the court rule regarding the mayor's testimony?

(A) Admissible, because the university president's character is at issue.

(B) Admissible, because it shows the university president supports

minorities.

(C) Inadmissible, because a specific incident is not enough to establish

one's character.

(D) Inadmissible, because it is not probative of any material issue in

the case.

5. At the trial of a personal injury action, the plaintiff claimed that he had
sustained a shattered elbow when he was knocked from his bicycle by
the defendant's car. A doctor testified for the plaintiff, stating that she
examined him for the first time on the morning of the trial and that her
examination was made specifically in preparation for her testimony.

The doctor stated that during the course of the examination, the
plaintiff said, “My arm hurts so much, I don't see how I'll ever be able
to go back to work.” Which of the following would be the defendant's
strongest argument in support of a motion to strike the testimony?

(A) The plaintiff's statement was made in contemplation of litigation.

(B) The doctor was not examining the plaintiff for the purpose of

treatment.

(C) The plaintiff's statement was self-serving.

(D) Evidence of the plaintiff's statement is more prejudicial than

probative.

6. A witness saw the fatal shooting of the victim. The witness told a grand
jury investigating the shooting that, “The defendant was the shooter! I
was standing 10 feet away when I saw the defendant murder the

600

victim!” The defendant was arrested and charged with murder. At trial,
the witness could not be found. Eventually, the police discovered that
the witness had moved out of the country and left no forwarding
address. Since the witness is unavailable, the prosecution attempts to
offer his grand-jury statement into evidence. The trial court is
convinced that the grand-jury testimony has circumstantial guarantees
of trustworthiness. Upon objection by the defendant, the witness's
statement should be

(A) admitted, because the witness is not available to testify at trial.

(B) admitted, because the use of the evidence is consistent with the

general interests of justice.

(C) admitted, because the trial court is convinced the grand-jury
testimony has circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.

(D) excluded.

7. The plaintiff sued an amusement park after the plaintiff was injured on
a rollercoaster. At trial, the plaintiff called a witness who testified that
she was at the amusement park and, after the plaintiff was injured, the
man employed by the amusement park to run the rollercoaster came
over and said, “I'm sorry! I didn't secure your seatbelt right!” The
amusement park objected.

The court should

(A) overrule the objection, because the statement is attributable to the

amusement park.

(B) overrule the objection, because the statement is a declaration

against interest.

(C) sustain the objection, because the statement is inadmissible against

the amusement park.

(D) sustain the objection, because the statement is inadmissible

hearsay.

8. A woman was the mother of a four-year-old girl. One day, because the

woman had an appointment, she left the girl in the care of the
defendant. While in the defendant's custody, the girl began to cry. In an
attempt to quiet her, the defendant beat her severely, striking her
repeatedly across the back and raising a series of welts and bruises.
Soon afterwards, the woman returned and took the girl home. As the

601

woman was undressing the girl to prepare her for bed, she noticed the
marks on the girl's body and asked, “What happened?” The girl
responded by saying that the defendant had spanked her. The defendant
was subsequently arrested and charged with child abuse. At the
defendant's trial on that charge, the woman was called as a witness by
the prosecution on the presentation of its direct case. When the woman
attempted to testify to the above conversation between herself and the
girl, the defendant's attorney objected on the ground that the girl's
statement was hearsay.

The prosecutor's most effective argument in opposition to the
objection would be that the statement is admissible as

(A) a present sense impression.

(B) an excited utterance.

(C) a statement of present physical condition.

(D) an identification.

9. At the trial of the defendant for receiving stolen property, the

prosecution called a man to the witness stand. The man testified that in
a conversation that he had with the defendant in jail shortly after the
defendant's arrest, the defendant admitted that he knew that the car that
he had been driving was stolen. Which of the following facts or
inferences would best support the defendant's motion to exclude the
man's testimony?

(A) At the time of their conversation, the man told the defendant that he

was an attorney.

(B) At the time of their conversation, the defendant reasonably believed
that the man was employed as an investigator for the defendant's
attorney.

(C) The man had offered to recommend an attorney to the defendant and

had asked the defendant to tell him the facts of the case.

(D) The man had been charged with a crime, and on the day of the

defendant's trial, had negotiated a favorable plea bargain in return
for his testimony.

10. The plaintiff was injured when she fell down a flight of steps at a
bartending school. She subsequently sued the school for damages,
asserting that the accident resulted from the school's negligence in

602

allowing parts of the stairway to become loose. At the trial, a doctor
testified that he had examined and treated the plaintiff following the
accident. On direct examination, he stated that, in his opinion, the
plaintiff had sustained a spinal injury. He also stated that in making the
diagnosis, he did not take a spinagram.

On cross-examination, the school's attorney asked the doctor whether
he had ever read the work of a noted specialist in spinal injuries. The
doctor replied that he had heard of the specialist, but that he had never
read any of her work. The school's attorney then opened a book by the
specialist and said, “In this book, the specialist says that it is
impossible to diagnose spinal injuries without taking a spinagram.
How do you justify your diagnosis in view of that statement?” If the
plaintiff's attorney objected to the question, the court should

(A) sustain the objection, since the specialist has not testified in the

proceeding.

(B) sustain the objection, since no proper foundation has been laid.

(C) overrule the objection, since an expert may be cross-examined

regarding the works of other experts in the field.

(D) overrule the objection, since the doctor admitted having heard of

the specialist.

11. A witness, testifying on behalf of the prosecution, stated that he saw the

defendant shoot the victim three times in the back. During the
defendant's case, the defendant's attorney offered two properly
authenticated judgments of conviction. One showed that the witness
had been convicted two years ago of attempted murder, which was a
felony. The other showed that the witness had been convicted one year
ago of knowingly making false statements in an application for a
business license, which was a misdemeanor. Over objection by the
prosecution, the court should admit the judgment(s) of conviction of

(A) attempted murder only.

(B) knowingly making false statements in an application for a business

license only.

(C) both crimes.

(D) neither crime.

12. An inspector employed by the State Aeronautics Bureau was assigned

603

to investigate the crash of an airline flight. During the course of his
investigation, the inspector questioned an airline mechanic who had
worked on the plane just before it took off on its last flight. The
mechanic said that while going over the plane, he had discovered some
dangerous cracks in its engine parts, but that when he called them to the
attention of his supervisor, he was told to forget about them. He stated
also that after the crash, he was fired as part of a cover-up. The
inspector included a verbatim transcript of the mechanic's statement in
the report that he filed as required by Bureau procedure. Soon
thereafter, the inspector and the mechanic both died. In an action
brought against the airline under the state's wrongful death statute by
the surviving spouse of a passenger who died in the crash, the plaintiff
offered the inspector's written report into evidence. Upon objection by
the airline, the portion of the report containing the transcript of the
mechanic's statement should be

(A) admitted, because the inspector is dead.

(B) admitted, because the mechanic is dead.

(C) admitted, as a vicarious admission by the airline.

(D) excluded, since it is hearsay.

13. The defendant was charged with stealing three valuable figurines from

the home of the victim while painting the interior of that home.

At the defendant's trial, the victim testified that he first noticed that the
figurines were missing about an hour after the defendant left his home.
He stated that he looked the defendant's number up in the telephone
book and properly dialed the number listed therein. Over objection by
the defendant's attorney, the victim stated that a man answered the
phone and said he was the defendant. The victim stated that he then
said, “Where are the figurines?” and that the person at the other end of
the line said, “I'm sorry. I took them.” The objection by the defendant's
attorney should be

(A) sustained, because there was no independent evidence establishing
that the defendant was the person to whom the victim was speaking.

(B) sustained, since the victim did not actually see the person to whom

he was speaking.

(C) sustained, since the statement is hearsay.

604

(D) overruled.

14. A statute provides that the owner of a motor vehicle is vicariously
liable for the negligence of any person driving with said owner's
permission. In an action for personal injuries brought by the plaintiff
against the defendant, the plaintiff alleges that she was injured as a
result of the negligent driving of a woman who was operating the
defendant's car with the defendant's permission at the time of the
accident. The defendant denies ownership of the vehicle in question.
Over the objection of the defendant's attorney, the plaintiff offers into
evidence an insurance policy issued by an insurance company. The
policy is authenticated by the testimony of an officer of the company,
who states that the policy was purchased by and issued to the
defendant, and that on the day of the accident, the policy was in force
on the vehicle in question. The policy and authenticating testimony
should be

(A) admitted, since it tends to establish that the defendant was the

owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident.

(B) admitted, since it is relevant to the defendant's ability to pay a

judgment rendered against her.

(C) excluded, because policy prohibits the introduction of evidence that
a party did or did not have liability insurance on the day of an
accident.

(D) excluded, because it has no probative value relative to the issues in

the case.

15. Two defendants were charged with committing an armed robbery that
occurred on a Saturday. Although they were being tried together, the
defendants were represented by different attorneys. Both asserted that
they were together at a rock concert in another state on the day of the
robbery. At the trial, a witness testified on behalf of the defendants. On
direct examination, the first defendant's attorney asked the witness
about a conversation he had with the first defendant on the Thursday
before the robbery. The witness stated that during that conversation, the
first defendant told him that she and the second defendant were
planning to leave for the rock concert together on Friday morning and
would not be back in town until Monday. Upon timely objection by the
prosecution, the testimony of the witness should be

(A) admitted, only insofar as it refers to the first defendant.

605

(B) admitted, only insofar as it refers to the second defendant.

(C) admitted, insofar as it refers to both defendants.

(D) excluded as hearsay.

16. The defendant was charged with murdering the victim, a prominent

union leader, by throwing him off the roof of an office building. At the
defendant's trial, the prosecution offered the testimony of a police
officer who arrived at the scene moments after the victim's death.

The officer testified that as he was getting out of his cruiser, he heard
an unidentified person in the crowd shout, “A tall man pushed him off
the roof!” The defendant's objection to the statement should be

(A) overruled, since it does not establish with certainty that the

defendant was the person referred to in the declarant's statement.

(B) overruled, since the person making the statement did so while in a
state of excitement resulting from what he had just observed.

(C) sustained, since the identity of the person making the statement is

unknown.

(D) sustained, because there are likely eyewitnesses available to testify

in court.

17. The publisher of a large daily newspaper printed an article by a

journalist in its employ. The article accused the plaintiff of misusing
church funds. The plaintiff commenced a defamation action against the
publisher.

At the trial of the defamation action, the publisher's attorney called a
bartender who worked in a bar near the publisher's office. The
bartender stated that on the day after the journalist's article appeared
in the newspaper, the journalist told him, “When I wrote that piece on
the plaintiff, I believed every word of it.” On objection by the
plaintiff's attorney, the bartender's testimony should be

(A) admitted as evidence that the article was published without malice.

(B) admitted as a declaration of the journalist's state of mind.

(C) admitted as a self-serving declaration.

(D) excluded as hearsay.

18. The defendant was an orderly employed by the hospital in which the

606

patient died. The administrator of the patient's estate sued the
defendant, seeking the return of a watch that he claimed that the
defendant had taken from the patient's hospital room after the patient
died. At the trial, the defendant testified that about one week prior to
the patient's death, the patient called him into his room and handed him
the watch, saying, “You've been kind to me. This is for you.” If the
administrator objects to the testimony, the court should

(A) overrule the objection, since the statement is an admission.

(B) overrule the objection under the applicable Dead Man's Act.

(C) overrule the objection, since the patient's statement had a direct
legal effect on the defendant's right to possess the watch.

(D) sustain the objection, since the statement is hearsay, not within any

exception to the hearsay rule.

19. Following his arrest on New Year's Eve, the defendant was charged
with reckless driving and driving while under the influence of
intoxicating liquor. The arresting officer testified at the defendant's
trial on those charges.

The officer stated that she was a highway patrol officer, that she was
familiar with the stretch of state highway on which the defendant was
arrested, and that she had extensive experience observing and
estimating the speed of moving vehicles. She said that she was in her
patrol car observing traffic from behind some bushes when she saw
the defendant drive by at what appeared to be an excessive rate of
speed. When asked by the prosecuting attorney whether she formed an
opinion of the defendant's speed at that time, she replied that she had.
When the prosecutor asked her to state that opinion, the defendant's
attorney objected. The objection should be

(A) sustained, because the officer did not claim she was an expert on

the speed of moving vehicles.

(B) sustained, since no proper foundation was laid.

(C) overruled, since a police officer is regarded as an expert on the

speed of moving vehicles.

(D) overruled, since a layperson may express an opinion regarding the

speed of moving vehicles.

20. Charged with forcible rape, the defendant relied on a defense of alibi.

607

At the trial, the victim testified that the defendant was the man who
accosted her on the street, dragged her into the basement of an
apartment building, and forced her to submit to sexual intercourse.
During the case, the defendant's attorney offered the testimony of a
witness who stated that she was familiar with the victim's reputation in
the community and that the victim was thought of as a prostitute. The
defendant's attorney also offered into evidence a certified court record
indicating that the victim had been convicted of prostitution, a
misdemeanor, two months prior to the alleged rape.

Upon proper objection by the prosecution, which of the following
should the court admit?

(A) The witness's testimony only.

(B) The court record only.

(C) The witness's testimony and the court record.

(D) Neither the witness's testimony nor the court record.

21. On January 15, after receiving a brochure from the company

advertising a sale of blank DVDs at an especially reduced price, a
store ordered 2,000 blank DVDs from the company for resale. When
the DVDs were delivered, however, the store's manager refused to
accept delivery, asserting that she had expected the DVDs to be
packaged in plastic cases, but that those delivered were packaged in
paper boxes. The company sued the store for breach of contract.

At trial, the store manager testified that it is easier to sell DVDs when
they are packaged in plastic cases. She attempted to testify further that
she had ordered blank DVDs from the company on three previous
occasions, and that the DVDs received in response to each order had
been packaged in plastic cases. If the company's attorney objects to
this testimony, which of the following would be the company's most
effective argument in support of the objection?

(A) Evidence of past conduct is not admissible for the purpose of
establishing a party's conduct on any particular occasion.

(B) The order was in writing and made no mention of the way in which

the products were to be packaged.

(C) The DVDs were being sold at an especially reduced price to permit

resale at a lower price.

608

(D) DVDs are commonly packaged in paper boxes like those in which

the blank DVDs had been delivered to the store.

22. A statute provides that “No person shall operate a motor vehicle on the
public roads of this state who is not covered by a policy of automobile
liability insurance with a limit of not less than $15,000. Any person in
violation of this section shall be guilty of a felony.” Following an
automobile accident in which a vehicle driven by the defendant
collided with a vehicle driven by the plaintiff, the defendant was
charged with operating an uninsured vehicle in violation of the statute.
After trial, the defendant was found guilty of violating the section and
sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Subsequently the defendant died,
and the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant's estate for
personal injuries sustained in the collision. In selecting the jury, the
plaintiff's attorney asked each of the prospective jurors whether he or
she owned stock in any automobile liability insurance carrier. During
the trial of the action, the defendant's attorney offered into evidence a
judgment of the defendant's conviction for driving an uninsured
vehicle. Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, the judgment should
be

(A) admitted, since the plaintiff's attorney has falsely suggested that the

defendant was insured at the time of the accident.

(B) excluded, since evidence that a party is or is not covered by

liability insurance is inadmissible to establish fault or freedom
from fault.

(C) excluded, since it is self-serving.

(D) excluded, since it is hearsay, not within any exception to the

hearsay rule.

23. During the trial of a personal injury claim arising from an automobile

accident, the defendant offered a videotape into evidence after
properly marking it for identification and testifying that it was an
accurate representation of the accident scene. On voir dire examination
by the plaintiff's attorney, the defendant stated that he hired a man to
make a videotape of the place where the accident occurred and that the
tape that had been offered in evidence was a copy of the tape made by
the man. He stated further that after the man gave the copy to him, he
mislaid it for several months, and that his wife found it only a few days
before the trial. When asked about the location of the original

609

videotape, the defendant said that he did not know where it was or
even whether it still existed.

Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, the court should rule that the
videotape copy is

(A) inadmissible, because the original videotape has not been shown to

be unavailable.

(B) inadmissible, because there is a period of time during which

custody of the videotape cannot be established.

(C) inadmissible, because the man has not authenticated it.

(D) admissible.

24. After his vehicle collided with the plaintiff's on March 1, the defendant
retained an attorney to represent him in any possible litigation that
might develop. The attorney hired a private investigator to interview
the plaintiff regarding the facts of the accident. On March 5, the
investigator followed he plaintiff into a bar, sat next to him, and
engaged him in conversation. During the conversation, the plaintiff
described the accident that he had with the defendant, and said, “Just
between you and me, I drank a six-pack of beer just before the accident
happened. It's a good thing nobody smelled my breath.” Eventually the
plaintiff commenced a personal injury action against the defendant. At
the trial of the action, the plaintiff testified on direct examination that
he had been driving at a slow rate of speed when the defendant's
vehicle suddenly pulled out of a driveway into his path.

On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the plaintiff
whether he had drunk alcohol during the hour prior to the accident.
The plaintiff answered that he had not. The defendant's attorney then
asked, “Didn't you tell an investigator from my office that you had
consumed an entire six-pack of beer just before the accident?” If the
plaintiff's attorney objects to the question, the court should

(A) sustain the objection, since the plaintiff's prior statement was not

made under oath.

(B) sustain the objection, since it was unethical for the defendant's

attorney to make contact with the plaintiff through an investigator.

(C) sustain the objection, since the statement is hearsay not within any

exception to the hearsay rule.

610

(D) overrule the objection.

25. In an action by the seller against the buyer for breach of contract, the

seller's manager testified that after the buyer refused to accept delivery
of merchandise as agreed, he personally arranged for the resale of the
goods at a price that was $3,000 less than that which the buyer had
agreed to pay.

On cross-examination, the buyer's attorney asked, “Didn't you once
plead guilty to violating Penal Code section 22.9(a)?” Which of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one true,
would most effectively support the seller's objection to the question?

(A) The manager's plea of guilty was the result of a plea bargain after

he had originally been charged with a more serious crime.

(B) The manager subsequently withdrew the guilty plea.

(C) Penal Code section 22.9(a) prohibits operating an automobile

without proper liability insurance coverage.

(D) The manager was not in the employ of the seller at the time of his

guilty plea.

26. The plaintiff was a student at a private high school. One day, while
leaving the school building in the rain, the plaintiff slipped on the
wooden steps that led from the school to the street. He immediately
experienced pain in his elbow, but he got up and went home. Later, the
pain became so severe that he went to see a doctor, who X-rayed the
elbow and told him that it was fractured. Eventually, the plaintiff
commenced an action for negligence against the school, claiming that
the paint that had been used on the wooden steps became extremely
slippery when wet with rain, and that the school was negligent in using
it.

At trial, the plaintiff subpoenaed the school's maintenance manager.
The manager testified that he stripped the old paint from the wooden
steps the day after the plaintiff's accident and repainted the steps with
a paint that did not become slippery when wet with rain. He said he
did so before the school learned of the plaintiff's accident. The
plaintiff offered this testimony as proof that the steps were in a
dangerous condition at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the
school's attorney, the manager's testimony should be

611

(A) admitted, since it is an admission.

(B) admitted, because the steps were stripped and repainted before the

school learned about the plaintiff's accident.

(C) excluded, because it is being offered for the purpose of proving that
the steps were in a dangerous condition at the time of the accident.

(D) excluded, since evidence of subsequent repair is not admissible in

an action for negligence.

27. The plaintiff was crossing the street on foot when she was struck by a

delivery van driven by an employee of the defendant while the
employee was in the process of making a delivery. Following the
accident, the employee was charged with reckless driving and pleaded
not guilty. At the trial on the charge of reckless driving, the employee
testified in his own defense. He stated that at the time of the accident,
he had taken his eyes off the road to look for the address of the place to
which he had to make his delivery, and that as a result, he didn't see the
plaintiff crossing the street.

The plaintiff subsequently brought an action against the defendant
under the theory of respondeat superior for personal injuries resulting
from the employee's negligence. At the trial, the plaintiff proved that
the employee remained in the defendant's employ until the employee
died from causes not related to the accident. The plaintiff then offered
a transcript of the employee's testimony at the reckless driving trial.
Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the transcript should be

(A) admitted, under the prior testimony exception to the hearsay rule.

(B) admitted, under the past recollection recorded exception to the

hearsay rule.

(C) admitted as a vicarious admission, under the public record

exception to the hearsay rule.

(D) excluded as hearsay not within any exception to the hearsay rule.

28. The defendant went to see a lawyer. After the lawyer closed her office
door and only the defendant and the lawyer were in the room, the
defendant asked, “Let's say I was to shoot someone. Would it make a
difference if I tried to pick a fight with him first? If he tried to hit me or
something, would that mean I could maybe claim self-defense?” The
lawyer explained the self-defense privilege to the defendant, and the

612

defendant went on his way. A week later, the defendant shot the victim
during a bar fight.

At trial, the defendant claimed he shot the victim in self-defense. The
prosecution called the lawyer to testify about his conversation with the
defendant. The defendant's attorney objected on the ground of attorney-
client privilege. The objection should be

(A) overruled, because the defendant did not pay the lawyer a fee.

(B) overruled, because the communication related to the carrying out of

a future crime.

(C) sustained, because the lawyer gave the defendant legal advice.

(D) sustained, because the conversation was confidential.

29. The victim was found dead in his garage, hanging by the neck from a
rope tied to a roof beam. His widow brought an action against the
victim's psychiatrist under the state's wrongful death statute. In her
complaint, the widow alleged that the psychiatrist was negligent in his
treatment of the victim, whom he knew or should have known to be
suicidal. In his answer, the psychiatrist denied that he knew the victim
to be suicidal, denied that he had treated him negligently, and denied
that the victim's death was a suicide. At the trial of the wrongful death
action, a nurse employed by the psychiatrist testified that the day
before the victim's death, she heard the victim say to the psychiatrist, “I
think suicide is the only way out.” Upon objection by the psychiatrist's
counsel, which of the following statements is most correct?

(A) The statement should be admitted for the purpose of establishing

that the victim's death was a suicide.

(B) The statement should be admitted for the purpose of establishing

that the psychiatrist knew or should have known that the victim was
suicidal.

(C) The statement should be admitted both for the purpose of

establishing that the victim's death was a suicide and that the
psychiatrist knew or should have known that the victim was
suicidal.

(D) The statement should not be admitted.

30. The defendant, a police officer who had recently joined the police

department, was charged with the murder of his wife. At the trial, the

613

prosecution claimed that while on a visit to the country, the defendant's
wife was walking across a meadow when the defendant shot her from
three-quarters of a mile away with a rifle equipped with a telescopic
sight. The defendant admitted firing the rifle, but he maintained that his
wife's death was an accident. On the presentation of the defendant's
case, his attorney called a firearms expert, who testified that the rifle
was not reliably accurate at any distance in excess of a half-mile.

On direct examination, the defendant's attorney showed the expert a
treatise on guns and asked him whether he had ever heard of it. The
expert said that he had, that the treatise was a recognized authority in
the field of firearms and ballistics, and that he used it in forming his
own opinion regarding the capabilities of the rifle. Over objection by
the prosecutor, the defendant's attorney read the expert a passage of the
treatise that stated that the accurate range of the rifle was a half-mile
and asked whether the expert agreed with that statement. When the
expert said that he did, the defendant's attorney offered the treatise in
evidence. The trial court will most likely

(A) sustain the objection, since direct examination of an expert

regarding the materials that he used in forming his opinion is not
permitted.

(B) sustain the objection, since although the questioning was proper, the

treatise itself is not admissible in evidence.

(C) overrule the objection, since the expert's testimony that the treatise
was a reliable authority laid a proper foundation for admission of
the treatise in evidence.

(D) overrule the objection, since the expert's testimony that he relied on
the treatise in forming his opinion laid a proper foundation for
admission of the treatise in evidence.

31. After the plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident, the plaintiff
sued the defendant for $50,000. Two weeks before trial, the plaintiff
went to the defendant's home and said, “Listen, you were negligent, but
I'm sick of worrying about this and I was texting when the wreck
happened. I'll dismiss my case against you for $10,000.” The defendant
refused the plaintiff's offer and would now like to testify regarding the
plaintiff's statement. May she do so?

(A) Yes, because it is admissible as a party admission.

614

(B) Yes, because it is admissible as a declaration against interest.

(C) No, because it is inadmissible hearsay.

(D) No, because it is inadmissible as an offer to compromise.

32. The defendant was on trial for vandalizing a national monument. The

defendant testified that she did not do it. The defendant wanted to call a
witness who would testify that she has known the defendant for at least
20 years and, in her opinion, the defendant has always been an honest
person. Is the witness's statement admissible?

(A) Yes, because the defendant testified she did not vandalize the

monument.

(B) Yes, because it is admissible to prove defendant's credibility as a

witness in her own defense.

(C) No, because the defendant's character for truthfulness has not been

attacked.

(D) No, because the witness is merely stating her opinion regarding the

defendant's truthfulness.

33. The landlord was the owner of a three-story professional building. The

entire second floor of the landlord's building was rented to an
optometrist. Persons visiting the office of the optometrist either rode in
an elevator located inside the building or climbed a stairway that was
fastened to the outside of the building and that led from the street level
to the second floor only. The plaintiff was a patient of the optometrist.
One day, upon leaving the optometrist's office and descending the
stairway on the outside of the building, the plaintiff fell, sustaining
serious injuries. She commenced an action against the landlord,
alleging that the stairway was dangerous in that it was too steep, it
lacked a handrail, and the stair treads were too narrow. The landlord
denied that the stairway was dangerous. In addition, as an affirmative
defense, he denied control over the stairway, asserting that it had been
leased to the optometrist as part of the second-floor office.

At the trial, the plaintiff called a manager who had been employed by
the landlord as building manager at the time of the accident, but who
was presently unemployed. The manager testified that two days after
the accident, the landlord instructed him to install a handrail on the
stairway and to post a sign that read, “CAUTION: Steep and narrow
stairway!” The landlord's attorney objected to the testimony and

615

moved that it be stricken. Which of the following would be the
plaintiff's most effective argument in response to the objection and in
opposition to the motion to strike?

(A) The manager is no longer in the landlord's employ.

(B) The testimony is relevant to establish that the stairway was

dangerous.

(C) The testimony is relevant to establish that the landlord was aware

that the stairway was dangerous.

(D) The testimony is relevant to establish that the landlord was in

control of the stairway.

34. The plaintiff and the defendant were employed as clerks in the law

office of an attorney. They disliked each other intensely. On February
6, they argued bitterly, almost coming to blows. Later, the plaintiff
went to the company parking lot and discovered that the tires and
canvas top on his car had been slashed with a knife. Angrily, he
returned to the office and accused the defendant of the vandalism in the
presence of the attorney, saying, “I dare you to deny it.” The plaintiff
subsequently instituted a tort action against the defendant for damage to
his car. At the trial, the attorney testified on behalf of the plaintiff.
After describing the events that took place in his office on February 6,
he stated that when the plaintiff dared the defendant to deny damaging
his car, the defendant said nothing. The attorney stated that he, the
attorney, then said, “If I thought you did this, I'd have to fire you. Now,
did you?” and that the defendant still said nothing. The attorney
testified further that he gave the defendant another opportunity to deny
the plaintiff's accusation, and that after the defendant refused once
again to answer, the attorney fired him. If the defendant's attorney
objected to the testimony, the court should

(A) overrule the objection, because the reasonable person in the

defendant's situation would have denied slashing the tires and
canvas top.

(B) overrule the objection, since the defendant is a party to the action
and will have an opportunity to deny making the statement.

(C) sustain the objection, since silence cannot be used as an admission

or form the basis for civil liability.

(D) sustain the objection, since answering the attorney's question might

616

have tended to incriminate the defendant.

35. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the plaintiff alleged
that it had entered into a written contract with the defendant for the
purchase of satin material that the plaintiff intended to use in
manufacturing its products, and that the defendant failed to deliver the
material as promised. At the trial, an employee testified that he worked
in the plaintiff's legal department, and that he had negotiated the
contract in question. He stated further that, although the original and all
copies of the contract had been destroyed in an office fire, he knew the
substance of its contents. When the plaintiff's attorney began to
question the employee about the contents of the contract, the defendant
objected. The trial court should

(A) sustain the objection, since the employee's testimony would violate

the parol evidence rule.

(B) sustain the objection, since the employee's testimony would violate

the best evidence rule.

(C) overrule the objection, since the absence of the original document

has been explained.

(D) overrule the objection, since the Statute of Frauds is satisfied by
the fact that a written memorandum of agreement was made.

36. The plaintiff sued the defendant, claiming that she slipped on a puddle
of water in the defendant's grocery store. The plaintiff called a witness
who the plaintiff's lawyer expected to say that she had seen the puddle
40 minutes before the plaintiff slipped, and that she informed the store
manager of the puddle. Instead, the witness said, “I never saw any
puddle.” Surprised, the plaintiff's lawyer then called the witness's
neighbor, who proposed to testify that the day after the accident she
was working in her backyard when the witness leaned over the fence
and told her, “That puddle was there for over an hour — and I told the
store manager about it!” The neighbor's testimony is admissible

(A) as truth of the matter asserted.

(B) only to impeach the witness.

(C) as evidence of material fact.

(D) because there are other “circumstantial guarantees of
trustworthiness” regarding the neighbor's statement.

617

37. Suspecting that some students were trafficking in illegal drugs, a
college chancellor requested assistance from the state police in
apprehending the traffickers. In response to the request, an undercover
police officer registered at the college as a student. While attending
classes, the officer became friendly with the defendant, who was
rumored to be involved in the illicit drug traffic. One day, while
chatting with the defendant, the officer said, “Hey, how about selling
me some heroin?” The defendant responded by saying, “I don't know
what you're talking about.” But the officer said, “Come on, everybody
knows about it. And I really need the stuff.” The defendant again
denied knowing anything about drugs, but the officer insisted,
displaying a $50 bill. “I'm really strung out,” the officer said. “I'll give
you $50 for stuff worth $25. Come on. How about it?” At this, the
defendant handed the officer a packet of heroin and took the $50 bill.
The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with the
unauthorized sale of a dangerous drug. At his trial, he asserted the
defense of entrapment. The prosecution offered the testimony of
several other students, who stated that on various occasions in the past,
they had purchased heroin from the defendant. The defendant's attorney
objected to the introduction of the testimony of the students. The
objection should have been

(A) sustained, since character evidence is not admissible against a

defendant in a criminal proceeding.

(B) sustained, since proof of unconvicted bad acts is not admissible for

the purpose of establishing a person's character.

(C) overruled, since such evidence would tend to prove that the

defendant was predisposed to commit the crime with which he has
been charged.

(D) overruled, since evidence of past conduct is relevant to establish
that a defendant engaged in criminal behavior on a particular
occasion.

38. The plaintiff slipped on a wet spot on the floor of the produce

department in a supermarket. He commenced an action for damages
two years and 11 months later, just before the three-year statute of
limitations would have run out. In her opening statement at the trial of
the action, the supermarket's attorney said that it was her client's
contention that the delay in instituting action indicated that the plaintiff
had not sustained any real injury and that the damages claimed by the

618

plaintiff were fabricated.

The plaintiff testified in his own behalf. During cross-examination, the
supermarket's attorney asked him when he consulted for the first time
with an attorney regarding the accident. The plaintiff answered, “Not
until a few months ago, because a man from the supermarket offered to
settle for $3,000, and I was trying to get a better offer.”

If the supermarket's attorney moved to strike that part of the answer
that referred to settlement negotiations, the motion to strike should be

(A) denied, since evidence of the settlement negotiations is admissible

to explain the plaintiff's delay in instituting the action.

(B) denied, since the settlement offer is relevant to establish that the

supermarket believed itself to be at fault.

(C) granted, since a policy rule prevents evidence of settlement

negotiations from being admitted.

(D) granted, since that portion of the answer was not responsive to the

question asked.

39. Executing a valid warrant, police raided an adult theater, lawfully

arresting its owner and lawfully seizing a copy of the film that he was
showing. The owner was subsequently charged with “conducting an
obscene film performance” in violation of a state law.

At trial, the prosecution called a professor to the stand. The professor
testified that she was a professor of film arts and the author of several
books on the art of erotic filmmaking. She said that although she
believed the erotic film to be a valid art form, she found the film at
issue to be devoid of any literary or artistic merit. She stated further
that in her opinion it was obscene. In objecting to this testimony, which
of the following would be the owner's most effective argument?

(A) The professor's opinion relates to an ultimate issue in the

prosecution.

(B) The professor's opinion is stated in legal terms.

(C) The professor does not qualify as an expert.

(D) Since the matter at issue is a subjective one, expert testimony is

inadmissible.

619

40. After bonds that the plaintiff purchased from the defendant proved to

be worthless, the plaintiff instituted an action against the defendant for
breach of contract and misrepresentation. At the trial, the plaintiff's
attorney subpoenaed the defendant's chief bookkeeper. The bookkeeper
appeared in court in response to the subpoena but refused to take the
stand. The trial judge told the bookkeeper that unless he took the stand,
he would be held in contempt of court. The bookkeeper continued to
refuse, asserting his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth
Amendment to the United States Constitution. He reasonably believed
that his testimony could tend to incriminate him. Should the bookkeeper
be held in contempt?

(A) Yes, since the privilege against self-incrimination applies only to

testimony at criminal proceedings.

(B) Yes, since the bookkeeper was not a party to the proceeding.

(C) Yes, since the privilege against self-incrimination does not justify a

refusal to take the stand in a civil proceeding.

(D) No, since the bookkeeper reasonably believed that his testimony

could tend to incriminate him.

41. The plaintiff sued the defendant claiming that she was bit when the
defendant's dog escaped from the defendant's yard and attacked her.
The defendant argued that she didn't own a dog. The plaintiff's lawyer
called the witness, expecting the witness to say that the defendant had
owned the dog for at least three years, and that her dog was the dog that
bit the plaintiff. Instead, the witness testified, “I've never seen a dog
around the defendant's property. In fact, the defendant is allergic.”
Surprised, the plaintiff's lawyer introduced a statement made by the
witness at deposition where the witness said, “The defendant has
owned that crazy dog for three years. And it has bitten everyone,
including the plaintiff.” The witness's deposition statement is
admissible as

(A) proof that the defendant owned the dog that bit the plaintiff.

(B) for impeachment purposes only.

(C) because the statement is necessary in the interests of justice.

(D) as a statement against interest.

42. The defendant, who was charged with armed robbery, retained an

attorney. In preparing the defense of his client, the attorney interviewed

620

the defendant's friend. The friend told the attorney that he and the
defendant had been together at a baseball game at the time of the
robbery. At the defendant's trial, the attorney called the friend to the
stand and asked if he had seen the defendant on the day of the robbery.
The friend said that he had not. The attorney subsequently called
another witness to testify that he had seen the friend and the defendant
together at the baseball stadium at the time of the robbery. The trial
judge should rule that the witness's testimony is

(A) inadmissible, because the attorney cannot impeach his own

witness.

(B) inadmissible, because the attorney is bound by the testimony of his

own witness.

(C) admissible, because the friend is a hostile witness.

(D) admissible, because the witness's testimony is relevant to material

issues.

43. A man and woman were in a car accident. Although the woman was
unhurt, the man was severely injured. The man looked at the woman
and said, “I know I'm about to die. I never told you this, but me and
[the defendant] murdered the doctor last year. He owed us money.” The
man then died. The defendant was later prosecuted for the murder, and
the prosecution called the woman to testify to the above statement by
the man. The man's statement is

(A) inadmissible hearsay.

(B) admissible under the excited utterance exception.

(C) admissible as a dying declaration.

(D) admissible as a present sense impression.

44. The plaintiff sued the defendant for damage that resulted from a

collision between the plaintiff's motorcycle and one of the defendant's
trucks. After receiving the summons, the president and sole stockholder
of the defendant notified the company attorney. The attorney said that
she wanted to meet with the president and the driver of the truck. At the
attorney's request, the president went to the attorney's office with the
driver who had been driving the truck at the time of the accident. While
discussing the case with the attorney in the presence of the driver, the
president said that on the day before the accident, he was aware that
the truck's brakes were not working properly but that because of his

621

heavy workload, he postponed making the necessary repairs.

At the trial of the plaintiff's suit against the defendant, the plaintiff
attempted to have the driver testify to the statement that the president
made to the attorney about the brakes. The defendant's attorney
objected on the ground of the attorney-client privilege.

Should the driver be permitted to testify to the president's statement?

(A) Yes, because the attorney-client privilege does not apply to

testimony by one who does not stand in a confidential relationship
with the person against whom the evidence is offered.

(B) Yes, because it is presumed that a communication made in the

presence of third persons is not confidential.

(C) Yes, because communications made by or on behalf of corporations

are not privileged.

(D) No.

45. At trial, a witness testified that on the day of the incident, she looked
up the defendant's number in the phone book and dialed it, and that a
male voice answered and said he was the defendant. The witness
stated further that she then asked, “Are you the animal that exposed his
privates to my daughter?” to which the voice replied, “Yes, I couldn't
help myself.” Finally, the witness testified that she was familiar with
the defendant's voice and recognized it when she was speaking to him
on the phone.

If the defendant's attorney objects to the witness's testimony regarding
the identification of the defendant's voice, the judge should rule this
testimony

(A) admissible, since the usual accuracy of the telephone directory,

coupled with the self-identification of the person who answered,
makes it likely that the person who answered was the defendant.

(B) admissible, since there is a presumption that a person who
gratuitously identifies himself or herself when answering a
telephone will do so accurately.

(C) admissible, because the witness testified that she was familiar with
the defendant's voice and recognized it when speaking to him on the
phone.

622

(D) inadmissible, as a violation of the defendant's privilege against

self-incrimination.

46. The plaintiff was in a motorcycle accident that shattered his leg. The
leg became severely infected after the defendant surgeon replaced the
plaintiff's shattered bone with cadaver bone. The infection led to the
eventual amputation of the plaintiff's leg. The plaintiff sued the
defendant for medical malpractice. At trial, the plaintiff called the
defendant as a witness. The only question that the plaintiff asked was,
“Did you perform the cadaver bone operation?” The defendant
answered “yes.” The plaintiff turned the defendant over to the
defendant's lawyer, who asked the defendant, “Wasn't the leg damage
so severe that it would have been amputated anyway even if you hadn't
tried to insert the cadaver bone?” The plaintiff's lawyer objected. The
court should

(A) sustain the objection, because the direct examiner has the right to

control the presentation of his or her case.

(B) sustain the objection, because the question goes beyond the scope

of direct.

(C) overrule the objection, because the question involves the

defendant's credibility.

(D) overrule the objection, because the question is within the scope of

the direct examination.

47. The defendant was on trial for the murder of his wife. The prosecution
wants to put the defendant's neighbor on the stand, who will testify that
she was watching television one evening when a friend of hers banged
on her front door and shouted, “I was jogging by and your neighbor just
came outside covered in blood and told me he shot his wife!” The
friend was then in an auto accident a few days later and now lies in a
coma.

Can the neighbor testify regarding her friend's statement?

(A) Yes, because it was an excited utterance.

(B) Yes, because the friend is now in a coma and cannot testify herself.

(C) No, because it is inadmissible hearsay.

(D) No, because the statement is being offered for its truth.

623

48. In a personal injury action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the

plaintiff claimed that the accident occurred because the defendant, who
was operating a blue Ford sedan, was driving at an excessive rate of
speed. At the trial, the plaintiff's attorney called the witness as a
witness on the plaintiff's direct case. The witness testified that after
hearing a broadcast on a police radio on the day of the accident, she
looked out her window and saw the defendant's blue Ford sedan strike
the plaintiff's red convertible on Main Street. The witness said that she
did not have a present recollection of what she had heard on the police
radio, but that she made a written note of it immediately following the
broadcast. The plaintiff's attorney showed her a piece of paper that had
been marked for identification, and the witness said that she now
remembered that she had heard a police dispatcher saying that officers
were in pursuit of a blue Ford sedan that was traveling down Main
Street at an excessive rate of speed.

If the defendant's attorney objects to the testimony of the witness
regarding what she heard on the police radio, the court should hold
that her testimony is

(A) inadmissible as hearsay, not within any exception.

(B) admissible as a sense impression.

(C) admissible as a past recollection recorded.

(D) admissible as present recollection refreshed.

49. At the trial of a personal injury action instituted by the plaintiff against
the defendant, the defendant testified on his own behalf as part of his
direct case. In response to a question by his attorney, the defendant
stated that shortly after the accident, he told a police officer that the
traffic signal light had been red against the plaintiff. Upon objection by
the plaintiff's attorney, the court should hold that the defendant's
testimony regarding his statement to the police officer is

(A) inadmissible hearsay.

(B) admissible, because the defendant's testimony was based on

firsthand knowledge.

(C) admissible as a prior consistent statement.

(D) admissible, because the defendant was on the witness stand and

available for cross-examination.

624

50. Charged with the rape of the victim, the defendant claimed that he and
the victim had frequently engaged in sexual intercourse in the past, and
that they sometimes played a game in which the victim pretended to
resist him and he pretended to overcome her resistance by force. He
asserted that on the day of the alleged rape, either the victim consented
to the intercourse or her conduct led him to reasonably believe that she
consented. At his trial, the victim testified that the defendant forced her
to have sexual intercourse with him on the day in question. On cross-
examination, the defendant's attorney asked the victim whether she ever
had sexual intercourse with the defendant willingly before the alleged
rape. If the prosecutor objects to this question, the objection should be

(A) sustained, since past sexual behavior of the complainant is not

material to the allegations of a rape prosecution.

(B) sustained, since the probative value of her answer is likely to be

outweighed by its prejudicial effect.

(C) overruled, in the absence of a statute prohibiting the inquiry, since
the complainant's past sexual behavior is logically relevant to the
elements of a rape prosecution.

(D) overruled, since the question and the testimony that it will elicit are

relevant to the defendant's defense of consent.

51. A state statute provides that the owner of any motor vehicle operated
on the public roads of the state is liable for damage resulting from the
negligence of any person driving the vehicle with the owner's
permission. The plaintiff was injured when a vehicle operated by a
man struck her while she was walking across the street. At the scene of
the accident, the man apologized to the plaintiff, saying, “I'm sorry. It
isn't my car. I didn't know that the brakes were bad.” The plaintiff
subsequently instituted an action against the defendant for her damages,
asserting that the defendant owned the vehicle. She alleged that the
defendant was negligent in permitting the vehicle to be driven while he
knew that the brakes were in need of repair and that he was vicariously
liable under the statute for the negligence of the man. The defendant
denied ownership of the vehicle. At the trial, the plaintiff offered
testimony by a mechanic that on the day after the accident, the
defendant hired him to completely overhaul the brakes. Upon objection
by the defendant, the evidence is

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

(A) admissible, to show that the defendant was the owner of the

625

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

vehicle.

(B) admissible, to show that the brakes were in need of repair on the

day of the accident.

(C) inadmissible, because the condition of the vehicle on any day other
than that of the accident is irrelevant to show its condition at the
time the accident occurred.

(D) inadmissible, under a policy that encourages safety precautions.

52. A hidden videotape camera at the office of a finance company routinely
records all transactions taking place during business hours. At the trial
of the defendant, a black man charged with robbing the company, the
prosecution offers a videotape made by the hidden camera at the time
the robbery occurred. The defendant's attorney objects to introduction
of the videotape on the ground that, while it is clear from the tape that
the robber was a black man, there is no certainty that the man pictured
was the defendant. Should the objection be sustained?

(A) Yes, since use of the tape violates the defendant's privilege against

self-incrimination.

(B) Yes, because the tape's value is outweighed by unfair prejudice.

(C) No, because if the defendant is pictured in the tape, it is admissible

as an admission.

(D) No, because the tape would tend to prove that the defendant was

the robber.

53. During a road rage incident, the victim was punched in the face. The
defendant was then prosecuted for assault. At trial, a witness was
called by the prosecution to testify. The witness stated that the victim
came to her apartment two days after the incident and told her, “[the
defendant] punched me in the face because he thought I was talking on
my cellphone and not paying attention to my driving.” The witness's
testimony is

(A) admissible as an excited utterance.

(B) admissible as a present sense impression.

(C) admissible as a declaration against the defendant's interest.

(D) inadmissible.

54. At the defendant's trial for murder, the witness testified that he heard

626

three gunshots immediately after hearing the defendant shout, “I'll kill
you!” The defendant's attorney asked no questions on cross-
examination but reserved the right to call the witness back to the stand
at a later time. Subsequently, the defendant's attorney offered the
testimony of a police officer who stated that, in an interview at the
scene of the shooting, the witness said that he did not hear any
gunshots. The police officer's testimony is

(A) admissible for impeachment purposes only.

(B) admissible as substantive evidence only.

(C) admissible for impeachment purposes and as substantive evidence.

(D) inadmissible, since it is hearsay not within any exception.

55. After derailment of a passenger train, the train corporation was
charged with criminal negligence under a statute that made
corporations criminally liable for the criminal negligence of their
employees. At trial, a state railroad inspector testified that on the day
of the derailment, the driver of the derailed train was operating the
train while intoxicated. The jury found the corporation not guilty of
criminal negligence. A passenger on the derailed train subsequently
instituted an action against the corporation for personal injuries that he
sustained as a result of the derailment. Although the passenger's
attorney properly served the inspector with a subpoena, he failed to
appear at the trial. If the passenger's attorney offers evidence of the
testimony that the inspector gave at the criminal proceeding, the
evidence is most likely to be admissible as

(A) an admission.

(B) past recollection recorded.

(C) former testimony.

(D) a present sense impression.

56. The defendant had been a member of a professional crime organization
for 20 years and had participated in many crimes during that period of
time. Because the defendant's testimony was crucial to the district
attorney's attempt to break the crime organization, the defendant was
offered transactional immunity if he would testify against other
members of the organization. He did so, and his testimony resulted in
several convictions. The defendant subsequently wrote and published a
book in which he described in detail many of the crimes that he

627

committed, including the shotgun murder of the victim. Following the
publication, the victim's wife commenced an action against the
defendant for damages resulting from the wrongful death of her
husband. At the trial, a police officer who had been called to the scene
of the victim's shooting testified that just before the victim died, he
heard him say, “I'm dying. I saw [the defendant] pull the trigger on me.”
The jurisdiction has a “dead man's statute.” If the defendant moves to
strike the police officer's testimony, his motion should be

(A) granted, since a dying declaration is admissible only in a trial for

criminal homicide.

(B) granted, since the defendant received transactional immunity.

(C) denied, since the victim believed himself to be dying when he made

the statement.

(D) denied, since the jurisdiction has a “dead man's statute.”

57. After the crash of an airplane, an action for wrongful death was

brought by the husband of a passenger killed in the crash. During the
trial, the plaintiff called an employee of the State Aviation Agency that
investigated the circumstances surrounding the crash.

The witness testified that during the course of his investigation, he
questioned a mechanic on the day of the crash. He said that the
mechanic stated that he and another mechanic had been assigned by the
airport supervisor to inspect the flight before takeoff, but that they did
not inspect the plane as directed. He also testified that the mechanic
claimed to be an employee of the airline. Independent evidence
indicated that the mechanic was employed by the airline and
authorized to speak for it at the time the statement was made. The
mechanic was unavailable to testify. If the witness's testimony is
objected to, the judge should rule it admissible

(A) because the witness testified that the mechanic claimed to be an

employee of the airline.

(B) because independent evidence indicated that the mechanic was
employed by the airline at the time the statement was made.

(C) because independent evidence indicated that at the time the

statement was made, the mechanic was authorized to speak for the
airline.

628

(D) because the mechanic is unavailable to testify.

58. The plaintiff was injured when the ladder on which she was standing
collapsed without warning. Immediately following the accident, the
plaintiff was taken to the hospital, where she remained for
approximately six hours. At the trial of the plaintiff's action against the
manufacturer of the ladder, a nurse employed by the hospital was
called to the stand by the plaintiff's counsel.

The nurse testified that he was on duty when the plaintiff was brought
into the hospital, and that the plaintiff complained of pain almost
continually from the time she arrived until the time she left. Upon
proper objection by the defendant, this testimony should be

(A) admitted, as a part of a pertinent medical history.

(B) admitted, as a statement of present physical sensation.

(C) not admitted, since pain is a purely subjective matter and not a
proper subject of testimony by anyone but the injured party.

(D) not admitted, since it is hearsay.

59. The defendant's dog frequently dug holes in the lawn of the plaintiff,
who had telephoned the defendant to complain in a loud voice on
several occasions. One day, after the dog dug up the plaintiff's prize
rosebush, the plaintiff ran to the defendant's house and banged on the
defendant's front door. When the defendant opened the door, the
plaintiff shouted, “You jerk!” The defendant struck him in the face with
his fist and closed the door. The plaintiff later sued the defendant for
battery, and the defendant asserted the privilege of self-defense. At the
trial, the defendant offered the testimony of a local shopkeeper, who
stated that he knew the plaintiff's reputation in the neighborhood and
that the plaintiff was known as “a bad actor who will fight at the drop
of a hat.”

If the plaintiff's attorney objects to the testimony of the shopkeeper, the
objection should be

(A) sustained, since evidence of the plaintiff's character is not relevant

to his action for battery.

(B) sustained, since the plaintiff is not the defendant.

(C) overruled, since the testimony is relevant to the defendant's

629

assertion of the privilege of self-defense.

(D) overruled, since the plaintiff placed his character in issue by

bringing the lawsuit.

60. At the trial of a negligence action, a doctor testified that she was the
orthopedic surgeon who treated the plaintiff. She stated that, at her
direction, technicians in her office X-rayed the plaintiff's left leg. She
stated further that, based upon her examination of the plaintiff's leg and
upon her study of the X-ray, it was her opinion that the plaintiff had
suffered a fracture of the tibia (a bone in the leg). She said she would
have formed the same opinion without inspection of the X-ray. The X-
ray was unavailable. Upon proper objection by the defendant, the
doctor's opinion should be

(A) excluded, because the X-ray was hearsay and she stated that her

opinion was based on it.

(B) admitted, because the X-ray is unavailable.

(C) admitted, because she testified that she would have formed the

same opinion without inspection of the X-ray.

(D) admitted, since the opinion of an expert may be based on matters

not in evidence.

61. While walking down a stairway that led to the women's restroom at a
theater, the plaintiff fell and sustained serious injuries to her shoulder.
She sued the theater for damages, alleging that it had negligently
permitted the stairway to be littered with scraps of paper and that she
had slipped on one of them.

At trial, the witness testified that he had been employed as the theater's
manager for a period of three weeks prior to the accident, that as such,
he was the person to whom accidents would ordinarily be reported,
and that in the three-week period preceding the accident, he had
received no reports of accident or injury occurring on those particular
stairs. The judge should rule this testimony

(A) admissible, because it tends to prove that the plaintiff did not use
the care that would have been exercised by a reasonable person.

(B) admissible, because it tends to prove that the theater was generally

careful about maintaining the stairway.

(C) inadmissible, because it is self-serving.

630

(D) inadmissible, because it is not probative of the theater's exercise of

due care on this particular occasion.

62. A man was dying of cancer, and his doctors only gave him a few

moments to live. The man gathered his family around his bed, including
his brother, and said, “I'm dying. I want all of you to know that [the
defendant] and I were the ones who murdered the police chief last
year.” Soon thereafter, against all odds, the man recovered and fled to
a small island off the coast of South America. The defendant was later
prosecuted for the murder, and the prosecution called the man's brother
to testify to the above statement by the man. The man's statement is

(A) admissible as a dying declaration.

(B) admissible as an excited utterance.

(C) inadmissible because the man did not die.

(D) inadmissible because it was hearsay not within any exception.

63. At the trial of an action for personal injuries resulting from an

automobile accident that occurred in the city, a witness testified for the
defendant. He stated that he was standing on a street corner at the time
of the accident and observed the plaintiff's car go through a red light.
The plaintiff's attorney had information indicating that the witness was
not even in the city on the day of the accident and had actually been
observed on that day committing an armed robbery in another city
located at the other end of the state. On cross-examination, she asked,
“Weren't you actually robbing a store in another city on the day this
accident occurred?” The witness refused to answer, invoking the
privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the
United States Constitution. Over objection by the defendant's attorney,
the judge ordered that the witness's entire testimony be stricken.
Subsequently, the defendant appealed from a judgment for the plaintiff,
asserting that the trial court erred in striking the witness's testimony.
Which of the following would be the plaintiff's most effective argument
in response to the defendant's assertion?

(A) The privilege against self-incrimination is effective only in

criminal proceedings.

(B) The trial record, independent of the witness's testimony, does not

indicate that the witness's answer would incriminate him.

(C) Since the trial determined the rights of persons other than the

631

witness, the requirement of due process outweighed the witness's
privilege against self-incrimination.

(D) The witness's refusal to answer prevented adequate cross-

examination.

64. The defendant, a college student, was charged with the attempted
murder of the victim, a fellow student, outside one of the college
classrooms. At trial, the defendant's attorney called the school's dean
of students to the witness stand. The dean testified that immediately
following the stabbing that led to the prosecution, she interviewed the
defendant, and he stated that when the victim insulted him, he stabbed
the victim in anger. She testified further that she had taken notes of the
conversation, which she then placed in the defendant's student file. If
the prosecutor offered the defendant's student file in evidence as a
business record, which of the following would be the defendant's most
effective argument in support of an objection to the admission of the
file?

(A) The dean had an independent recollection of the events and was

present in court to testify.

(B) The investigation of crimes is not a regularly conducted business

activity for the college.

(C) The business record exception to the hearsay rule does not apply in

criminal trials.

(D) The defendant's statement is second-level hearsay.

65. In a challenge to the will of the deceased, opponents of the will called
the deceased's next-door neighbor to the stand. The neighbor testified
that she had observed the deceased acting strangely for several months
before and after the date on which his will had been executed. When
asked to specify in what way his behavior was strange, she said that he
frequently appeared in his front yard wearing nothing but a towel and a
football helmet, turning his face to the sky and shouting, “Bring on the
saucers! I'm ready to do battle!” She said that there were also times
when she found him wandering about the street in a daze, and that on
several occasions she had to take him home because he told her that he
didn't know where he was. In rebuttal, proponents of the will called a
doctor to the stand. The doctor testified that he had seen the deceased
only three days before the execution of the will for his semiannual
medical checkup and that he did not observe any strange behavior at

632

that or any other time. If opponents of the will seek to exclude the
doctor's statement from evidence, the statement should be

(A) excluded, since evidence that abnormal behavior was not observed
is inadmissible to establish the sanity or competence of a decedent.

(B) excluded, because the doctor's testimony does not indicate a
sufficient opportunity to observe the deceased's behavior.

(C) admitted, because the opponents of the will opened the door by

introducing the testimony of the neighbor.

(D) admitted, since a medical doctor may qualify as an expert on the

sanity of a patient.

66. At the trial of the plaintiff's personal injury action against the

defendant, the witness was called as a witness on the plaintiff's direct
case. The witness, a police officer, testified that he arrived at the scene
of the accident about 10 minutes after it occurred. He stated that when
he got there, he had a conversation with another police officer who
was already on the scene. When the witness said that he had no
independent recollection regarding the nature of their conversation, the
plaintiff's attorney showed him a copy of an official police report and
asked whether he recognized it. The witness identified it as the report
that he filed following his investigation of the accident. The plaintiff's
attorney offered the report in evidence. The defendant's attorney
objected to its admission on the ground that it contained the following
statement:

The other officer reports that an unidentified witness told him that the
defendant went through a red light without stopping.

Should the police report be admitted into evidence?

(A) Yes, because the witness used it to refresh his recollection while

testifying.

(B) Yes, because it is a business record.

(C) No, because a police report is not a record kept in the usual course

of business.

(D) No, because neither the witness nor the other officer saw the

accident.

67. The buyer, a United States importer, contracted with the seller, a Dutch

633

manufacturer, for the purchase of trivets to be manufactured in the
Netherlands by the seller. When the seller delivered the trivets,
however, the buyer refused to accept them, asserting that he had
contracted for genuine porcelain and that the trivets delivered by the
seller were imitation porcelain. The buyer died shortly afterwards.
The seller sued the buyer's estate in the United States for breach of
contract, claiming that he explained to the buyer during negotiations
that the trivets would be made of imitation porcelain.

At trial, the attorney for the buyer's estate called the buyer's brother as
a witness. The brother testified that he was an expert in Dutch and had
been present at the negotiations between the buyer and the seller. He
said that the seller and the buyer asked him to assist by translating
when necessary because neither spoke the other's language very well.
He stated further that when the trivets were being discussed, the seller
said something in Dutch that the buyer said he did not understand. The
buyer then asked his brother to translate, and the brother replied, “He
says that the trivets will be genuine porcelain.” The jurisdiction has a
“dead man's statute.” The seller's attorney objected to the brother's last
statement and asked the court to exclude it from the record.

The brother's statement should be

(A) admitted, because it is relevant to the buyer's intention at the time

the contract was formed.

(B) admitted, because the jurisdiction has a “dead man's statute.”

(C) admitted, because the brother qualified as an expert on the Dutch

language.

(D) excluded, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

68. After receiving a tip, police officers stopped a car being driven by the

defendant and forced him to open the trunk. In it, the officers
discovered a canvas bag containing seven pounds of cocaine. They
seized the car and the cocaine as evidence and placed the defendant
under arrest. Without advising him of his rights to remain silent and to
consult with an attorney, they questioned him about the cocaine. During
the questioning, the defendant said, “I don't know anything about it. It
isn't even my car.”

The defendant was charged with illegal possession of a controlled

634

substance. Subsequently, the defendant's motion to suppress the use of
the cocaine as evidence was granted, and the charges against him were
dismissed. The defendant thereupon commenced an appropriate
proceeding against the police department for recovery of his
automobile. On presentation of his direct case, the defendant testified
that he owned the seized automobile but had registered it to a friend
for purposes of convenience. On cross-examination, the attorney
representing the police department asked, “After your arrest, did you
tell the arresting officers that it wasn't your car?”

If the defendant's attorney objects to this question, the objection should
be

(A) sustained, because the defendant's interrogation was in violation of

his Miranda rights.

(B) sustained, because the defendant's motion to suppress was granted.

(C) overruled, because the automobile in which the cocaine was

transported is “fruit of the poisonous tree.”

(D) overruled, because his denial that he owned the car was a prior

inconsistent statement.

69. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for breach of contract,
the attorney for the plaintiff called an employee as a witness. The
employee testified that she was the employee of the plaintiff in charge
of the defendant's account. She said that on May 17, she had supervised
a shipment of dyes to the defendant. She stated that she did not
personally inspect the shipment but that immediately after the company
shipping clerk inspected the shipment, he told her its contents and she
listed them on an invoice and signed it. A copy of the invoice was then
sent to the defendant in accordance with standard company practice.
She said that she no longer had any independent recollection of what
the shipment contained, but that the original invoice was now in the
hands of the company attorney. When the attorney representing the
plaintiff showed her a document and asked her to identify it, she said
that it was the invoice to which she had referred, and that the signature
on it was her own. When the attorney for the plaintiff offered it in
evidence, the attorney for the defendant objected.

If the court admits the invoice into evidence, it will most probably be
as

635

(A) past recollection recorded.

(B) a record kept in the usual course of business.

(C) an original document under the best evidence rule.

(D) present recollection refreshed.

70. The plaintiff was a commercial furniture-finisher. The defendant was a
manufacturer of commercial furniture-finishing supplies. In an action
by the plaintiff against the defendant for breach of contract, a dispute
arose as to the meaning of the term “unit of lacquer,” which appeared
in a contract between the parties. The witness, an officer of the
plaintiff, testified on her company's direct case.

The witness testified that in the furniture-finishing industry the term
“unit of lacquer” means 55 gallons of lacquer. If the defendant's
attorney objects, the witness's testimony should be

(A) excluded as a self-serving statement.

(B) excluded as hearsay, not within any exception to the hearsay rule.

(C) admitted as evidence of business habit.

(D) admitted, because it serves to establish a trade usage.

71. At the defendant's trial on a charge of rape, the victim testified that
after meeting him in a bar, she accompanied the defendant to his
apartment, where he forced her to have sexual intercourse with him
against her will. The defendant's attorney did not cross-examine the
victim.

In his opening statement, the defendant's attorney said that although his
client admitted to having sexual intercourse with the victim shortly
after they first met on the night in question, he intended to prove that
the victim consented to the intercourse. Then, on direct presentation of
the defendant's case, his attorney attempted to offer evidence of the
victim's prior sexual conduct with other men.

Upon objection by the prosecution, this evidence should be

(A) admitted for the purpose of impeachment only.

(B) admitted as substantive evidence only.

(C) admitted as substantive evidence and for the purpose of

636

impeachment.

(D) excluded.

72. In the trial of a tort action in a United States district court, if the

substantive law of the state is being applied, which of the following
statements is correct regarding confidential communications between
psychotherapist and patient?

(A) The United States district court MUST recognize the

psychotherapist-patient privilege if it is recognized by the law of
the state.

(B) The United States district court MAY recognize the

psychotherapist-patient privilege even if it is not recognized by the
law of the state.

(C) The United States district court MAY recognize the

psychotherapist-patient privilege if it is recognized by the law of
the state.

(D) The United States district court does not need to make any notice of

state law.

73. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for personal injuries
resulting from negligence, the plaintiff's attorney called the witness as
a witness on the plaintiff's direct case. The witness's testimony was
offered to prove that the plaintiff suffered physical pain from his
injuries. The witness testified that she was the plaintiff's mother, and
that during the weeks following the accident, she observed the plaintiff
taking pink pills on several occasions. The plaintiff's attorney then
asked the witness if she knew why the plaintiff was taking the pink
pills. When the defendant's attorney objected, the plaintiff's attorney
withdrew the question and asked whether the witness was present
when the doctor examined the plaintiff the day after the accident. The
witness responded that she heard the plaintiff say, “My neck hurts,” and
that the doctor handed the plaintiff the pink pills and said, “These pink
pills are very effective for pain.”

If the defendant's attorney moves to exclude the witness's testimony
about what the doctor said, that testimony should be

(A) admitted as a declaration of present physical sensation.

(B) admitted as a declaration of past physical sensation.

637

(C) excluded as hearsay, not within any exception to the hearsay rule.

(D) admitted as evidence of a medical history.

74. The defendant pleaded not guilty to a charge of committing an armed

robbery of a bank. When the defendant appeared in court on the day of
the trial, his head was completely bald.

The prosecuting attorney called the employee as a witness on the
prosecution's direct case. The employee testified that she was
employed by the bank, and that she was present when the robbery was
committed. She stated that the robber had bushy red hair. When asked
whether the defendant was the robber, she looked at him sitting in the
courtroom and said that she was not sure. The prosecuting attorney
then asked her whether she had identified the defendant as the robber
at a lineup conducted on the day of the robbery. If the defendant's
attorney objects to that question, the objection should be

(A) sustained, since her statement is hearsay not within any exception.

(B) sustained, since the prosecuting attorney may not impeach his own

witness.

(C) overruled, since the employee is on the witness stand and available

for cross-examination.

(D) overruled, since the employee is a disinterested witness.

75. The plaintiff sued the defendant, alleging that the defendant was

negligent in building a new office building. The plaintiff called a well-
known engineer as an expert witness. During the engineer's direct
testimony, the engineer identified a book as a reliable authority in the
field. How may the book be used at trial?

(A) It may be given to the jury to examine in the presence of the judge.

(B) The engineer may read relevant passages to the jury.

(C) The jury may take the book with them into the jury room.

(D) While the engineer may have relied on the book in forming his
opinion, he may not read from the book or give it to the jury.

76. The defendant was charged with the second degree murder of the

victim under a statute that defined that crime as “the unlawful killing of
a human being with malice aforethought, but without premeditation.”
The defendant's attorney asserted a defense of insanity and called the

638

defendant as a witness on his own behalf. After the defendant testified
on direct examination and cross-examination, his attorney called a
doctor to the witness stand. The doctor stated that he was a
psychiatrist, had practiced for 30 years, had treated thousands of
patients with illnesses like the defendant's, and had testified as an
expert in hundreds of criminal homicide trials. He testified, “After
listening to the defendant's testimony, I am of the opinion that the
defendant did not have malice aforethought as our law defines it on the
day of the victim's death.” On cross-examination, the doctor admitted
that he had never spoken to or seen the defendant before, and that his
opinion was based entirely on his observations of the defendant's
testimony.

Which of the following would be the prosecuting attorney's most
effective argument in support of a motion to exclude the doctor's
statement?

(A) The doctor's testimony embraces the ultimate issue.

(B) The doctor's opinions were based entirely upon courtroom

observations.

(C) The doctor had insufficient opportunity to examine the defendant.

(D) Whether the defendant had “malice aforethought” is a question to

be decided by the jury.

77. At the trial of her negligence action against the defendant, the plaintiff
exhibited her leg to the jury and testified that following the accident,
her leg was so badly mangled that she believed that she was going to
die. The plaintiff's attorney then called a witness, who testified that he
arrived at the scene of the accident moments after it occurred and found
the plaintiff lying in the roadway in a pool of blood. The witness stated
that he heard the plaintiff scream, “Oh, God, I had the green light in my
favor and now I'm dying!” The defendant's attorney made timely
objection to the witness's testimony.

Which of the following is the best reason for concluding that the
plaintiff's statement was NOT a dying declaration?

(A) The plaintiff's statement did not identify the person who she

believed to be responsible for her death.

(B) The plaintiff was in court when the witness testified to her

639

statement.

(C) The proceeding was a civil one.

(D) The plaintiff was not dying at the time her statement was made.

78. The plaintiff retained the defendant, an attorney, to represent him in
connection with a boundary dispute between the plaintiff and his
neighbor. Subsequently, the plaintiff sued the defendant for
malpractice, alleging that the defendant negligently failed to institute an
action to quiet title before such action was barred by the statute of
limitations. At the trial, the defendant testified that he advised the
plaintiff to commence an action to quiet title, but that the plaintiff
instructed the defendant not to do so, stating that he feared that because
of the litigation, his neighbor might find out that the plaintiff had once
been convicted of a felony. The plaintiff objected on the ground that his
communication with the defendant was confidential. In a jurisdiction
that recognizes the common law attorney-client privilege, the plaintiff's
objection should be

(A) sustained, because the plaintiff's statement was related to the

reason for his consultation with the defendant.

(B) sustained, because the plaintiff's statement was necessary to his

consultation with the defendant.

(C) overruled, because the defendant's testimony is relevant to the issue

of the defendant's negligence.

(D) overruled, because an adversary proceeding between attorney and
client terminates the confidential relationship between them.

79. The defendant, a 16-year-old child, was involved in an accident while
driving a friend's car. At the request of the plaintiff, who was injured in
the accident, a court designated the defendant's father as the defendant's
legal guardian for the purpose of defending the plaintiff's lawsuit
against the defendant. The plaintiff then sued the defendant, joining her
father as a defendant as required by state law. The defendant and her
father consulted an attorney about the lawsuit. The father was present
when the defendant told the attorney that she had been driving over the
speed limit at the time of the accident. The attorney refused to
represent the defendant, and her father thereafter retained another
attorney. At the trial of the plaintiff's action against the defendant and
her father, the attorney was called as a witness on the plaintiff's direct
case. When the plaintiff's attorney attempted to question him regarding

640

the conversation that he had with the defendant, the defendant's attorney
objected on the ground that the conversation was privileged. In a
jurisdiction that recognizes the common law attorney-client privilege,
should the objection to the attorney's testimony be sustained?

(A) Yes, because the father's designation as the defendant's legal
guardian made his presence at the consultation necessary.

(B) Yes, because all communications made by a client to an attorney

while seeking advice are privileged.

(C) No, because the defendant and the father are joint defendants.

(D) No, because the attorney never agreed to represent the defendant

and the father.

80. Section 481 of the City Code of Municipal Ordinances provides in
part, “In any municipal parking lot operated by the City, it shall be a
misdemeanor for any person to park a vehicle more than 17 feet in
length in a space marked ‘Compact Car Only.”’ At the defendant's trial
on a charge of violating that section, the public prosecutor rested after
proving that the defendant's car was more than 17 feet in length and that
it had been parked in a municipal parking lot operated by the city in a
space marked “Compact Car Only.” Without offering any evidence, the
defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that the public prosecutor
had failed to prove the contents of Section 481 of the City Code of
Municipal Ordinances. In response to the defendant's motion, the
public prosecutor asked the court to take judicial notice of that section.
The jurisdiction permits a court to take judicial notice of municipal
ordinances. The defendant's motion to dismiss should be

(A) granted, because the jurisdiction permits a court to take judicial

notice of municipal ordinances.

(B) granted, because the alleged violation of Section 481 of the Code
of Municipal Ordinances is an ultimate issue to be determined by
the trier of fact.

(C) granted, because the court qualifies as an expert on the contents of

the City Code of Municipal Ordinances.

(D) denied, because the contents of local law need not be proven in a

criminal prosecution.

81. The State Police Commissioner was subpoenaed to appear before a
state grand jury investigating corruption in state law enforcement

641

agencies. After being sworn, the commissioner refused to answer any
questions, asserting his privilege against self-incrimination under the
Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. After the state
prosecutor granted him use immunity, however, the commissioner
testified that for years he had been aware that his assistant, the
defendant, and certain other members of his department were receiving
bribes from members of nationwide organized crime syndicates. The
defendant was subsequently charged in a state court with receiving
bribes. At the defendant's trial, the commissioner was called as a
witness for the defense. On direct examination, the commissioner
testified that he had never heard of the defendant or any other member
of his department engaging in corrupt acts.

On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the
commissioner, “Didn't you testify at a grand jury proceeding that you
had been aware for years that the defendant had been taking bribes?”
The commissioner refused to answer on the ground that he had
received immunity before testifying at the grand jury proceeding.
Should the court compel the commissioner to answer the question?

(A) Yes, but the answer is admissible only for the purpose of

impeaching the commissioner's credibility.

(B) Yes, but the answer is admissible only as substantive evidence

against the defendant.

(C) Yes, and the answer is admissible for the purpose of impeaching

the commissioner's credibility and as substantive evidence against
the defendant.

(D) No.

82. While crossing a street in the city, the plaintiff was struck by a

northbound hit-and-run motorist and severely injured. In a subsequent
negligence action against the city, the plaintiff asserted that there was a
dangerous curve on the street just south of the place where the accident
occurred, and that the city was negligent in failing to post signs
warning pedestrians and motorists of the danger. During trial, the court
issued a special instruction to the jury regarding the dangers of
negative evidence.

As part of its defense, the city called the city traffic commissioner as a
witness. The witness testified that she had been the city traffic

642

commissioner for the past 20 years and that the street south of the
accident location was substantially unchanged during the period of the
witness's employment. The witness stated that because of her official
position, all reported traffic accidents in the city were brought to her
attention whether or not they resulted in lawsuits. She stated further
that although the street was a busy thoroughfare, she had never heard
of an accident on the street prior to the plaintiff's injury.

Upon proper motion by the plaintiff's attorney, the testimony of the
witness should be

(A) admitted, because the street south of the accident location was
substantially unchanged during the period of the witness's
employment.

(B) admitted, because the court issued a special instruction to the jury

regarding the dangers of negative evidence.

(C) excluded, because it is possible that accidents occurred that were

not reported.

(D) excluded, because of the inherent unreliability of negative

evidence.

83. In a negligence action against a hotel, the plaintiff asserted that while

she was a guest at the hotel, she slipped on wet pigeon droppings in an
alley located next to the hotel, sustaining injury. In defense, the hotel
denied that it was negligent and denied ownership and control of the
alley in which the accident occurred. At the trial, the plaintiff called a
hotel maintenance employee as a witness. The witness testified that
although employees of the hotel had never before cleaned pigeon
droppings from the alley, they began doing so after the plaintiff
commenced her lawsuit against the hotel. If the hotel objects to the
testimony of the witness, the testimony should be

(A) admitted.

(B) excluded, because subsequent cleaning of pigeon droppings may

have been nothing more than a response to the litigation.

(C) excluded, because of a policy that encourages the taking of

remedial measures following an accident.

(D) excluded, because the hotel denied that it was negligent.

84. At the trial of a personal injury action, a doctor testified that she

643

examined the plaintiff on the day of the trial, and that at that time, the
plaintiff told her that she felt pain in her knee. On cross-examination,
the defendant's attorney asked the doctor whether she had ever met the
plaintiff before the day of the trial. The doctor responded that she had
not, and that her sole purpose in examining the plaintiff was to prepare
for testifying at the trial. The defendant's attorney then moved to strike
that portion of the doctor's testimony that referred to the plaintiff's
complaint of pain. In a jurisdiction that applies the common-law rule
regarding confidential communications between patient and physician,
should the defendant's motion be granted?

(A) Yes, because the examination was solely for the purpose of

litigation.

(B) Yes, because the probative value of the statement is outweighed by

the possibility of prejudice.

(C) Yes, because statements made to a physician are privileged.

(D) No, because the statement described what the plaintiff was feeling

at the time.

85. At the trial of the defendant on a charge of criminal battery, the

prosecutor called the victim as a witness. The victim testified that he
had argued with the defendant in a bar shortly before he was struck in
the head from behind. He said that he did not see who struck him, but
that a moment before the blow, he heard a voice that he did not
recognize shout, “Watch out for [the defendant]!”

If the defendant's attorney objects to the victim's statement about what
he heard, that statement should be

(A) excluded, because the victim could not identify the person who

shouted.

(B) excluded, because the victim's testimony is self-serving.

(C) admitted.

(D) excluded, because there was no proof that the person shouting had

personal knowledge of the assailant's identity.

86. Procedural delays caused five years to pass before the plaintiff's

personal injury claim against the defendant was ready for trial. At the
trial, the plaintiff's attorney called the witness, an eyewitness to the
accident. The witness testified that before coming to court, she had

644

refreshed her recollection by looking at written notes of her interview
with the plaintiff's attorney that took place the week after the accident.
On proper motion by the defendant's attorney, the court

(A) should strike the witness's testimony, unless it is shown that the

notes themselves are unavailable.

(B) may direct that the notes be brought into court for inspection by the

defendant's attorney.

(C) may not properly direct that the notes be brought into court because

they have not been offered into evidence.

(D) should admit the notes into evidence as an admission of a party.

87. During the presentation of the plaintiff's direct case in a personal injury

action, the plaintiff's attorney called a doctor to the stand for the
purpose of establishing that the plaintiff had sustained an injury to one
of her glands.

When the plaintiff's attorney began to question the doctor about her
qualifications, the defendant's attorney conceded on the record and in
the presence of the jury that the doctor was an expert on injuries of the
glands and objected to any further questions regarding the
qualifications of the doctor. The court was satisfied that the doctor
qualified as an expert on glands. Should the plaintiff's attorney be
permitted to continue questioning the doctor regarding her
qualifications?

(A) No, because the qualifications of the doctor are no longer in issue.

(B) No, because the court is satisfied that the doctor is qualified as an

expert on diseases and injuries of the glands.

(C) Yes, because the court must determine for itself whether a witness

qualifies as an expert and cannot allow the matter to be determined
by stipulation of the parties.

(D) Yes, because the jury may consider an expert's qualifications in

determining his or her credibility.

88. The plaintiff was a passenger in a car driven by the defendant when the
car struck a pole. The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim against
the defendant, alleging that injuries that resulted from the defendant's
negligent driving caused the plaintiff to be hospitalized for more than a
month. At trial, on the presentation of the plaintiff's direct case, the

645

plaintiff testified that immediately after the accident, while the
defendant was extremely nervous and upset, the defendant said, “Don't
worry, I've got plenty of insurance.”

Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, that portion of the
plaintiff's testimony should be

(A) excluded, because it is not relevant to a material issue.

(B) excluded, because it relates to a compromise offer.

(C) admitted as evidence of an admission of a party.

(D) admitted as evidence of an excited utterance.

89. At the defendant's trial on charges of criminal assault and battery, the
witness was called by the prosecutor. The witness testified that while
he was walking through a parking lot at night, the defendant attacked
and beat him. The witness stated further that although there were no
artificial lights of any kind in the vicinity of the parking lot, he was
able to see the defendant clearly in the light of the full moon. After
direct examination of the witness by the prosecutor, the defendant's
attorney waived cross-examination, and the witness left the courtroom.

The defendant's attorney subsequently called an expert witness to
testify that there was no moon at all on the night of the alleged crime.
The prosecutor conceded the expert's qualifications.

Upon timely objection by the prosecutor, the expert's testimony should
be

(A) admitted to show that the witness's testimony is not worthy of

belief.

(B) admitted, because it is part of the res gestae.

(C) excluded, because the witness was not given an opportunity to
explain his testimony in view of the additional evidence.

(D) excluded as extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.

90. The defendant was arrested after she used a credit card bearing the
name “Timothy Nolan” to pay for a purchase. The defendant was
subsequently charged with fraudulent use of a credit card. At her trial,
a police officer testified that when she arrested the defendant, she
found her to be in possession of 5 credit cards bearing the name

646

“Timothy Nolan” and 36 other credit cards bearing a total of 36
different names. In addition, the officer stated that the defendant's
wallet contained driver's licenses to match each of the various names
on the credit cards.

If the defendant's attorney moves to exclude evidence that the
defendant possessed credit cards or driver's licenses other than that
which she was charged with fraudulently using, which of the following
would be the prosecutor's most effective argument in opposition to that
motion?

(A) The number of credit cards and driver's licenses in the defendant's

possession tends to establish a criminal plan.

(B) The number of credit cards in the defendant's possession makes it

likely that she had stolen them.

(C) The defendant should be required to explain why she possessed so

many credit cards belonging to other people.

(D) The defendant's possession of 41 credit cards bearing names other

than her own is an admission by conduct.

91. The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant for

damages resulting from personal injuries sustained in an automobile
accident. Prior to trial, the parties and their attorneys attended a
settlement conference in the judge's chambers. During the course of the
settlement conference, the judge asked the defendant how fast she was
going at the time of the accident, to which the defendant replied, “I
really don't know, Your Honor.” The defendant was not under oath.

At the trial, the defendant testified on her own behalf. In response to a
question by her attorney, the defendant said, “When the accident
occurred, I was definitely not exceeding the speed limit.” On cross-
examination, the plaintiff's attorney asked the defendant, “Did you ever
say that you didn't know how fast you were going at the time of the
accident?” The defendant's attorney objected to the question.

The objection of the defendant's attorney should be

(A) sustained, because a proper foundation was not laid.

(B) sustained, because the defendant was not under oath at the

settlement conference.

647

(C) overruled, because the statement that the defendant made at the

settlement conference tends to establish that the defendant is not
worthy of belief.

(D) sustained, because the plaintiff's attorney failed to confront the

defendant prior to asking her about the statement.

92. The defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
while operating a car that he borrowed from a friend earlier that day.
After the arrest, the police conducted an inventory search of the vehicle
and found a container of marijuana in the trunk. As a result, the
defendant was charged with violating a state law that made it a crime
to knowingly possess marijuana. Testifying on his own behalf at the
trial, the defendant stated that he was not aware there was marijuana in
the trunk. On cross-examination, after properly marking it for
identification, the prosecutor showed the defendant a letter that had
been taken from his coat pocket following his arrest, and he asked
whether he recognized it. When the defendant said that it was a note
from his wife, the prosecutor showed it to the defendant's attorney and
offered it in evidence. Among other things, the note said, “We sure got
high on that stuff we smoked last night.”

The jurisdiction recognizes the common law spousal privilege. If the
defendant's attorney objects to admission of the letter, his objection
should be

(A) sustained, because the letter is hearsay not within any exception to

the hearsay rule.

(B) sustained, because the letter is not relevant to a material issue.

(C) sustained, because the jurisdiction recognizes the common law

spousal privilege.

(D) overruled, because the letter is a declaration against the penal

interest of the defendant's wife.

93. At the trial of an action for breach of contract brought by the plaintiff
against the defendant, the plaintiff's attorney called the plaintiff as a
witness on her own behalf. The plaintiff was an expert in dog behavior.
On direct examination, the plaintiff's attorney asked, “Do you own a
German shepherd with a white forepaw?” The plaintiff said that she
did. No other questions were asked on direct examination. On cross-
examination, the defendant's attorney asked the plaintiff, “Your dog is

648

generally known to be gentle, isn't that correct?”

If the plaintiff's attorney objects to the question, the objection should
be

(A) sustained, because the question went beyond the scope of cross-

examination.

(B) sustained, because the question is leading.

(C) overruled, because the plaintiff is a hostile witness.

(D) overruled, because the plaintiff is an expert in dog behavior.

94. Which of the following is NOT self-authenticating?

(A) A will with the attestation of witnesses affixed to it.

(B) A newspaper.

(C) A directory of public service telephone numbers issued by the state

civil services administration.

(D) A copy of a divorce decree prepared by the attorney for one of the
divorced spouses and certified correct by the clerk of the court.

95. The plaintiff was riding a motorcycle manufactured by the defendant
when he collided with an automobile, sustaining serious personal
injuries. Following the accident, examination of the motorcycle
revealed that its fork was severely bent. The plaintiff claimed that the
fork bent when he drove the motorcycle over a bump in the road, and
that the bending of the fork caused him to lose control and strike the
automobile. The plaintiff asserted a personal injury claim against the
defendant on the ground that the motorcycle was equipped with a fork
that was not strong enough to withstand the pressures of normal
operation and was therefore defective in design. The defendant denied
that the motorcycle was defective and claimed that the accident
resulted from the plaintiff's negligent operation of the motorcycle and
that the fork did not bend until the motorcycle collided with the
automobile. During trial, the judge gave the jury a special instruction
regarding the uncertainty of negative evidence.

The defendant called the witness, who was employed by the defendant
as vice president in charge of safety. The witness was the person to
whom all complaints of product failure would be reported. The
witness testified that he had held that position for six years, that in that

649

time the company had sold more than 10,000 motorcycles identical to
the one ridden by the plaintiff, and that the witness had never heard
about a fork bending in normal operation. If the plaintiff's attorney
objects, the witness's testimony should be

(A) admitted, because the judge gave the jury a special instruction

regarding the uncertainty of negative evidence.

(B) admitted, because the witness was the person to whom all

complaints of product failure would be reported.

(C) excluded, because it is possible that accidents occurred that were

never reported to the company.

(D) excluded, because negative evidence is inherently unreliable.

96. While visiting the United States from a Central American republic, the
plaintiff purchased a sweater at a department store and paid for it at the
appropriate cash register. In ringing up the sale, however, the store
employee neglected to remove a security tag that was still affixed to
the sweater to prevent theft. As a result, the tag caused an electronic
security alarm to ring as the plaintiff attempted to exit the store with the
purchased merchandise. Security guards immediately accosted her and
placed her under citizen's arrest. Eventually, the police were called,
and a more thorough investigation was instituted. As a result, it was
determined that the plaintiff had paid for the merchandise. Authorities
of the department store apologized to the plaintiff and permitted her to
leave.

Subsequently, a magazine erroneously reported that the plaintiff had
been arrested, charged with shoplifting at the department store, and
taken into police custody. Because the plaintiff was a candidate for
political office in the Central American republic, newspapers in that
country reprinted the magazine article. The plaintiff lost the election,
and she instituted an action against the magazine for damages resulting
from defamation.

On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney asked a witness whether
he and the plaintiff were political rivals, and the witness answered
that they were not. The plaintiff's attorney subsequently offered the
testimony of a republic official, who stated that, in a recent election,
the witness ran against the plaintiff for political office, and that the
witness won the election by engaging in a campaign of false

650

accusations against the plaintiff. Upon appropriate motion of the
magazine's attorney, the testimony of the official should be

(A) admitted, since it tends to attack the witness's credibility by

showing bias.

(B) admitted, since the magazine opened the door by bringing the

plaintiff's reputation into question.

(C) admitted, since it is evidence of an admission.

(D) excluded.

97. At the trial of a personal injury action, the plaintiff claimed that he had
sustained a shattered elbow when he was knocked from his bicycle by
the defendant's car. A doctor testified for the plaintiff, stating that she
examined him for the first time on the morning of the trial and that her
examination was made specifically in preparation for her testimony.

The doctor then stated that during the course of the examination, the
plaintiff also said, “When I was struck by the car, my right elbow
struck the ground so hard that I heard a sound like a gunshot.” If the
defendant objects to this testimony, the court should

(A) sustain the objection, since the statement is hearsay.

(B) sustain the objection, since the examination was not performed for

the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.

(C) overrule the objection, since the statement was part of a pertinent

medical history.

(D) overrule the objection, since the statement described a former

sense impression.

98. After a minor impact caused an automobile to explode, killing all its
occupants, the company that manufactured the car was charged with
criminal negligence and prosecuted by the state. At the trial, an
automobile safety design expert testified under oath on behalf of the
prosecution. He stated that in his opinion the car was poorly designed,
and that because of the construction of its engine, an explosion was
inevitable if the front end of the car collided with any object at an
impact speed in excess of 35 miles per hour.

Subsequently, the plaintiff was injured when the car that he was
driving exploded after striking another vehicle in the rear. The plaintiff

651

brought an action in a neighboring state against the company for
personal injuries.

Pursuant to a subpoena that had been served on the company, the
plaintiff's attorney called upon the company to produce records of tests
that it had performed on the car before marketing it. The company's
attorney objected, on the ground that the company had turned the test
records over to its attorney in preparation for trial. Should the trial
court require production of the records?

(A) No, since they are privileged as an attorney's work product.

(B) No, since they are privileged as materials prepared for litigation.

(C) No, since they are privileged as a confidential communication to an

attorney.

(D) Yes, since they are relevant to the issues and not protected by

privilege.

99. The plaintiff was injured when she fell down a flight of steps at a
bartending school. She subsequently sued the school for damages,
asserting that the accident resulted from the school's negligence in
allowing parts of the stairway to become loose.

On the defendant's case, the school's attorney called a doctor to the
stand. After establishing that she was an expert in the field of spinal
injuries, the school's attorney asked her whether, in her opinion, it was
possible for a person to sustain a herniation of the spine in a fall down
a flight of steps. The doctor stated that in her opinion it was not
possible to sustain such an injury in that way. On cross-examination,
the plaintiff's attorney asked the doctor whether she had ever examined
or treated the plaintiff. The doctor answered, “I have never even met
the plaintiff.” The plaintiff's attorney then moved to strike the
testimony that the doctor had given on direct examination. The motion
should be

(A) granted, since the doctor's opinion is not based on matters within

her personal knowledge.

(B) granted, since the doctor's opinion is based on matters not in

evidence.

(C) denied, since the doctor was testifying in response to a hypothetical

question.

652

(D) denied, since an expert's testimony may be based on observations

made in the courtroom.

100. The defendant was charged with murdering the victim, a prominent

union leader, by throwing him off the roof of an office building. At the
defendant's trial, the prosecution offered the testimony of a police
officer who arrived at the scene moments after the victim's death.

The prosecuting attorney asked the officer whether he interviewed any
of the people in the crowd. The officer replied that he interviewed an
eyewitness, but that he no longer remembered her name or what she
told him. He then said that he had accurately recorded the contents of
the eyewitness's statement in his notebook as she was making it and
that he had brought the notebook to court with him. The prosecuting
attorney asked the officer to read the contents of the statement to the
jury. If the defendant's attorney objected, the court should

(A) sustain the objection, since the statement of the eyewitness is

hearsay, not within any exception to the hearsay rule.

(B) overrule the objection, since the statement is a past recollection

recorded.

(C) overrule the objection, since the statement is part of the res gestae.

(D) overrule the objection, since the officer's notebook is a business

record.

101. The plaintiff sued a newspaper publisher for stating that the plaintiff
had misused church funds. The publisher's attorney offered the
testimony of an editor employed by the publisher. The editor testified
that it was his job to note retraction demands in an office file, and that
as a matter of company policy and practice, all such demands were
promptly reported to him for that purpose and promptly noted by him.
He said that on the morning of the trial he had searched the file for
notes of any retraction demand made by the plaintiff and found none. If
the publisher's attorney offers the file in evidence, the plaintiff's
objection should be

(A) sustained, since the absence of a notation cannot be used as

evidence that an event did not occur.

(B) sustained, since the file is self-serving.

(C) overruled, since the file itself is admissible as a business record.

653

(D) overruled, since the editor used the file to refresh his recollection.

102. Following his arrest on New Year's Eve, the defendant was charged
with reckless driving and driving while under the influence of
intoxicating liquor. The arresting officer testified at the defendant's
trial on those charges.

The officer stated that she chased the defendant in her patrol car,
apprehended him, and ordered him out of his car. The prosecutor
asked, “Did you notice anything in particular about his breath at that
time?” The officer answered, “Yes, it smelled like alcohol.” The
defendant's attorney objected to the question and moved to strike the
answer. The motion should be

(A) granted, because the question was leading.

(B) granted, since the officer's answer was a conclusion.

(C) granted, since the officer's statement went to an ultimate issue in the

case.

(D) denied.

103. At trial for breach of contract, the defendant offered the testimony of a

store manager who stated that blank DVDs from the plaintiff always
came in plastic cases. In response, the plaintiff offered the testimony of
a witness, who stated that he was the plaintiff's shipping manager and
in charge of filling orders for blank DVDs received by the plaintiff.
Over objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness stated that in
the past four months the plaintiff had shipped DVDs packaged in paper
boxes to 20 other customers and that none had rejected them. He also
testified that the 20 customers were of the same general size and class
as the defendant. The objection should have been

(A) overruled, since evidence of previous dealings is usually

admissible for the purpose of establishing the parties' state of mind
at the time the contract was formed.

(B) overruled, since the defendant opened the door by offering the

testimony of the store manager.

(C) overruled, because the 20 customers to which the witness referred

were of the same general size and class as the defendant.

(D) sustained, since such transactions are not relevant to the agreement

between the plaintiff and the defendant.

104. After his vehicle collided with the plaintiff's on March 1, the defendant
retained an attorney to represent him in any possible litigation that
might develop. The attorney hired a private investigator to interview
the plaintiff regarding the facts of the accident. On March 5, the
investigator followed he plaintiff into a bar, sat next to him, and
engaged him in conversation. During the conversation, the plaintiff
described the accident that he had with the defendant, and said, “Just
between you and me, I drank a six-pack of beer just before the accident
happened. It's a good thing nobody smelled my breath.” Eventually the
plaintiff commenced a personal injury action against the defendant. At
the trial of the action, the plaintiff testified on direct examination that
he had been driving at a slow rate of speed when the defendant's
vehicle suddenly pulled out of a driveway into his path. During cross-
examination, the plaintiff stated that he had not been drinking prior to
the accident.

During presentation of the defendant's case, the defendant's attorney
called the investigator to the stand. Over objection by the plaintiff's
attorney, the investigator described the conversation that he had with
the plaintiff in the bar on March 5 and stated that the plaintiff told him
that he had consumed a six-pack of beer just prior to the accident. The
investigator's testimony was

(A) admissible for impeachment purposes only.

(B) admissible as substantive evidence only.

(C) admissible for impeachment purposes and as substantive evidence.

(D) inadmissible.

105. In an action by the seller against the buyer for breach of contract, the

seller's manager testified that after the buyer refused to accept delivery
of merchandise as agreed, he personally arranged for the resale of the
goods at a price that was $3,000 less than that which the buyer had
agreed to pay.

On cross-examination, the buyer's attorney asked, “Didn't you once
plead guilty to violating Penal Code section 22.9(a)?” The manager
denied ever pleading guilty to the code section. The buyer's attorney
subsequently offered a transcript of the manager's conviction for
violating the code section. If only one of the following facts or
inferences were true, which would most effectively support the

655

seller's objection to its admission into evidence?

(A) The manager's violation of the code section is unrelated to his

duties as an employee of the seller.

(B) The manager's conviction was subsequently reversed on the ground
that the evidence used against him was obtained in violation of the
Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

(C) The crime of which the manager was convicted was a

misdemeanor.

(D) The crime of which the manager was convicted was a malum

prohibitum felony.

106. The plaintiff was crossing the street on foot when she was struck by a
delivery van driven by an employee of the defendant while the
employee was in the process of making a delivery. Following the
accident, the employee was charged with reckless driving and pleaded
not guilty. At the trial on the charge of reckless driving, the employee
testified in his own defense. He stated that at the time of the accident,
he had taken his eyes off the road to look for the address of the place to
which he had to make his delivery and that as a result, he didn't see the
plaintiff crossing the street.

The plaintiff subsequently sued the defendant under the theory of
respondeat superior. The plaintiff proved that the employee was in
the defendant's employ until the employee died of natural causes
unrelated to the accident. The plaintiff then offered the transcript of the
employee's testimony at the reckless driving trial.

The court refused to admit the transcript of the employee's testimony.
Upon presentation of the defendant's case, the defendant's attorney
offered into evidence a properly certified transcript of a court record
indicating that the employee had been acquitted after trial on the
charge of reckless driving. Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney,
the transcript should be

(A) admitted, as an official record.

(B) admitted, to raise a conclusive presumption that the employee was

not driving recklessly at the time of the accident.

(C) excluded, since the employee is not available for cross-

examination regarding his guilt or innocence of the charge of

656

reckless driving.

(D) excluded, since it is not relevant to the issues on trial.

107. A young couple was driving home from a party when they collided

with the plaintiff's car. The police arrived at the scene and arrested the
driver for driving while intoxicated. He was later tried and acquitted.
Several months after the trial, the plaintiff instituted an action against
the driver for personal injuries resulting from the accident.

The couple married after the criminal trial but divorced before the
civil trial. If the plaintiff's attorney asks the driver's ex-wife to state
how much alcohol she had observed the driver consume at the party,
the driver's objection should be

(A) sustained, since the ex-wife's testimony would involve a

confidential marital communication.

(B) sustained, under the spousal privilege.

(C) sustained, since a rule of policy prevents the testimony of a former

spouse from being used against a party.

(D) overruled.

108. The defendant, a police officer who had recently joined the police

department, was charged with the murder of his wife. At the trial, the
prosecution claimed that while on a visit to the country, the defendant's
wife was walking across a meadow when the defendant shot her from
three-quarters of a mile away with a rifle equipped with a telescopic
sight. The defendant admitted firing the rifle but maintained that his
wife's death was an accident. On the presentation of the defendant's
case, his attorney called a firearms expert, who testified that the rifle
was not reliably accurate at any distance in excess of a half-mile.

In rebuttal, the prosecutor called a police officer who joined the
police force at the same time as the defendant. The officer testified that
he and the defendant had attended firearms classes together at the
police academy, and that the defendant had been with him in a firearms
class when their instructor said that the rifle was capable of
remarkable accuracy at distances of up to two miles if fired by a good
marksman. On objection by the defendant's attorney, the testimony of
the officer should be

(A) admitted, only for the purpose of proving that the defendant

657

believed the rifle to be accurate at the distance involved.

(B) admitted, only for the purpose of proving that the rifle was accurate

at the distance involved.

(C) admitted for the purpose of proving that the defendant believed the
rifle to be accurate at the distance involved, and for the purpose of
proving that it was accurate at that distance.

(D) excluded as hearsay.

109. The defendant was arrested for murder. While he was being held in the

county jail, he shared a cell with the witness, who was being held on
misdemeanor vandalism charges. During the defendant's trial, the
prosecutor called the witness to the stand to authenticate the
defendant's voice on an audio clip posted to the Internet the day of the
murder. After the prosecutor laid the proper foundation, the witness
testified that although he never knew the defendant before his arrest, he
spoke with the defendant when they were sharing the cell together and
the voice on the audio file was the defendant's. The defendant's
attorney objected, arguing the witness could not properly authenticate
the defendant's voice.

The court should

(A) sustain the objection, because the witness's testimony is

inadmissible hearsay.

(B) sustain the objection, because the witness had never heard the

defendant's voice until after his felony arrest.

(C) overrule the objection, because the witness spoke with the

defendant while they shared the cell.

(D) overrule the objection, because the witness can be qualified as a

special expert in a criminal trial.

110. At trial, a witness testified that on the day of the incident, she looked
up the defendant's number in the phone book and dialed it, and that a
male voice answered, “[Defendant] speaking.” The witness stated
further that she then asked, “Are you the animal that exposed his
privates to my daughter?” to which the voice replied, “Yes, I couldn't
help myself.”

The witness testified further that she knew it was the defendant on the

658

phone because she had once chatted with him outside the grocery store
and recognized his “really deep” voice. If the defendant moves to
strike this testimony, the motion should be

(A) granted, since one conversation is not sufficient to justify testimony

as to voice identification.

(B) granted, since expert testimony is required for the identification of

a voice.

(C) denied, since a voice may be identified by a layperson who

testifies that he or she recognized it because he or she had heard it
before under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.

(D) denied, because the witness testified to a distinctive characteristic
about the defendant's voice that permitted her to recognize it.

111. In a personal injury action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the

plaintiff claimed that the accident occurred because the defendant, who
was operating a blue sedan, was driving at an excessive rate of speed.
At the trial, the plaintiff's attorney called a witness who testified that
she was walking on the street at the time the accident occurred and
that, although she did not see the vehicles before the collision, she
knew that the defendant's vehicle was traveling at a high rate of speed
because of the screeching sound made by his tires immediately before
the impact. If the defendant's attorney objects to this testimony, the
court should

(A) permit the witness to testify, but should give the jury a cautionary

instruction regarding lay opinions.

(B) permit the witness to testify, because a layperson is competent to
form an opinion regarding the speed of a moving automobile.

(C) exclude the witness's testimony, because a layperson is not

competent to form an opinion as to the speed of a moving
automobile.

(D) exclude the witness's testimony, because the witness did not have
an adequate opportunity to form an opinion regarding the speed of
the defendant's automobile.

112. After the crash of an airplane, an action for wrongful death was

brought by the husband of a passenger killed in the crash. During the
trial, the plaintiff called an employee of the State Aviation Agency that
investigated the circumstances surrounding the crash.

659

The witness read aloud from an investigation report that quoted an
unidentified witness to the crash as stating that she heard an explosion
several seconds before she saw the plane burst into flames. He
testified that the report from which he was reading was one kept in the
regular course of business by the State Aviation Agency, that the entry
from which he was reading had been made by another investigator
who worked for the Agency, that the investigator who made the entry
was sworn to investigate airplane crashes and to keep honest and
accurate records of the results of those investigations, and that the
investigator who made the entry was now dead. Upon appropriate
objection, the evidence should be ruled

(A) admissible as a business record.

(B) admissible as an official written statement.

(C) admissible as past recollection recorded.

(D) inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.

113. The plaintiff was injured when the ladder on which she was standing

collapsed without warning. Immediately following the accident, the
plaintiff was taken to the hospital, where she remained for
approximately six hours. The plaintiff later sued the manufacturer of
the ladder. At the trial, the plaintiff's attorney next offered a properly
authenticated hospital record. After examining the record, the
defendant's attorney, outside the presence of the jury, moved to exclude
a portion of the record that read: “History: Ladder collapsed. Patient
fell.” The motion to exclude that portion of the record should be

(A) granted, because it can be excluded without causing any physical

damage to the record.

(B) granted, because it has no bearing on the plaintiff's medical

condition.

(C) denied, because the history was taken for the purpose of diagnosis

or treatment.

(D) granted, since hospital personnel are not experts in determining the

causes of accidents.

114. The plaintiff sued the defendant for battery. At trial, the defendant

offered the testimony of the local parish priest, who stated that he had
known the defendant for years and that he and everyone else in the
community thought of him as a peaceable man who would never resort

660

to violence except in self-protection. The defendant offered the
testimony as circumstantial evidence to prove that he did not strike the
plaintiff without justification.

If the plaintiff's attorney objects to the testimony of the parish priest,
the testimony should be

(A) excluded, because it is being offered as circumstantial evidence to

prove that the defendant did not strike the plaintiff without
justification.

(B) admitted, because the priest testified that his own opinion of the
defendant coincided with what the community thought about him.

(C) admitted, because it states the reputation of the defendant.

(D) admitted, for the limited purpose of establishing the defendant's

state of mind at the time of the occurrence.

115. While walking down a stairway that led to the women's restroom at a
theater, the plaintiff fell and sustained serious injuries to her shoulder.
She sued the theater for damages, alleging that it had negligently
permitted the stairway to be littered with scraps of paper and that she
had slipped on one of them.

At trial, the theater manager testified that immediately following the
accident, a crowd formed around the fallen plaintiff, and he heard a
friend of his in the crowd shout, “She was taking the stairs three at a
time and she missed one!” He stated that the speaker was a good
friend of his, who offered to testify if need be. The judge should rule
this testimony

(A) admissible as an excited utterance.

(B) admissible, because the manager can identify the person who made

the statement.

(C) admissible, because the person who made the statement offered to

testify to it herself.

(D) inadmissible as hearsay.

116. The plaintiff was a commercial furniture-finisher. The defendant was a

manufacturer of commercial furniture-finishing supplies. In an action
by the plaintiff against the defendant for breach of contract, a dispute
arose as to the meaning of the term “unit of lacquer,” which appeared

661

in a contract between the parties. The witness, an officer of the
plaintiff, testified on her company's direct case.

The plaintiff's attorney asked the witness whether the plaintiff and the
defendant had ever done business in the past. In response, the witness
said, “Definitely. In fact, before coming to court today, I refreshed my
recollection by looking at company files. Then, based on my own
knowledge, I prepared a chart, which accurately indicates the dates of
the occasions we have done business together.” After the witness
testified to those dates, the plaintiff's attorney offered the chart that the
witness had prepared into evidence. Should the chart be admitted into
evidence over the objection of the defendant's attorney?

(A) Yes, as a summary of a business record.

(B) Yes, as an illustration of the witness's testimony.

(C) No, because it is not the best evidence of the contents of the

plaintiff's files.

(D) No, because a witness may not refresh his or her recollection by
reference to materials unless they are in court and marked for
identification.

117. The defendant pleaded not guilty to a charge of committing an armed

robbery of a bank. When the defendant appeared in court on the day of
the trial, his head was completely bald. Witnesses stated that the bank
was robbed by a man with bushy red hair.

The prosecuting attorney called a guard as a witness. The guard
testified that she was employed as a guard in the county house of
detention where the defendant had been in custody since the day of his
arrest. She stated that when she saw the defendant on the day of his
arrest he had bushy red hair. She stated further that, at the defendant's
request, she provided the defendant with shaving articles on the
morning of the trial and remained outside his cell, where she watched
while he shaved his head. If the defendant's attorney objects to this
testimony, the testimony should be

(A) excluded, as extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.

(B) excluded, under the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.

(C) admitted, to explain why the defendant no longer has bushy red hair.

662

(D) admitted, as evidence of an admission by conduct.

118. Soon after his election as labor union president, the defendant raised
his presidential salary from $135,000 to $160,000 per year. As a
result, he was subsequently charged with violating a state law making
it a felony for union officials to knowingly misappropriate union funds.
The defendant admitted granting himself the pay raise but claimed as a
defense that when he did so, he believed the union rules authorized
such action.

The defendant's attorney called the former president of the union. The
former president testified to a conversation that took place between
him and the defendant before the defendant ordered the pay raise. The
former president stated that when the defendant asked him whether the
union president was permitted to raise his own salary, the former
president told him that the president could do so whenever he deemed
it necessary. If the prosecuting attorney objects to the former
president's testimony on the ground that it is hearsay, the former
president's testimony should be

(A) admitted, as evidence of the defendant's state of mind.

(B) excluded, as hearsay, not within any exception.

(C) excluded, because the former president likely does not qualify as an

expert on the union's rules.

(D) admitted, because the out-of-court assertion was made by the

witness himself.

119. At the trial of her negligence action against the defendant, the plaintiff

exhibited her leg to the jury and testified that following the accident,
her leg was so badly mangled that she believed that she was going to
die. The plaintiff's attorney then called a witness, who testified that he
arrived at the scene of the accident moments after it occurred and
found the plaintiff lying in the roadway in a pool of blood. The witness
stated that he heard the plaintiff scream, “Oh, God, I had the green light
in my favor and now I'm dying!” The defendant's attorney made timely
objection to the witness's testimony.

The witness's testimony is

(A) admissible as evidence of an excited utterance.

(B) inadmissible as hearsay, not within any exception.

663

(C) admissible as evidence of a declaration of present state of mind.

(D) admissible as evidence of a declaration of past state of mind.

120. The defendant was charged in a state court with third degree arson on
the allegation that he set fire to his own house for the purpose of
collecting benefits under a fire insurance policy. At his trial, the
defendant called the witness as a witness in his favor. On direct
examination by the defendant's attorney, the witness testified that at the
time of the fire, he and the defendant were together at a baseball game
50 miles away from the defendant's home.

The prosecuting attorney then offered proof that the witness had been
arrested as an accessory to the burning of the defendant's house and
that the charge against him was still pending. If the defendant's attorney
objects to this evidence, the objection should be

(A) sustained, because evidence of unconvicted bad acts is
inadmissible to extrinsically impeach a witness.

(B) sustained, because the arrest of the witness is not material to the

charge against the defendant.

(C) overruled, because the pending charge against the witness is

evidence that the witness is a biased witness.

(D) overruled, because the arrest is evidence that the witness has a bad

reputation for honesty and truthfulness.

121. The plaintiff appeared as a chef on a televised cooking contest. After

the plaintiff was eliminated and left the room, the defendant, a judge on
the show, turned to another one of the judges and said, “That guy was
totally on drugs and his cooking tastes like it.” The plaintiff didn't
know about the defendant's statements until he watched the show on
television. Concerned that the defendant's statement could damage the
success of his new restaurant, the plaintiff sued the defendant for
defamation. At trial, the plaintiff testified as to what the defendant said
on the television show. The defendant's attorney objected.

The objection should be

(A) granted, because a recording of the show would be the best

evidence regarding what was said.

(B) granted, because the testimony is inadmissible hearsay.

664

(C) denied, because it is a declaration against interest.

(D) denied, because the plaintiff saw the television show where the

defendant made his statements.

122. At the trial of the defendant on a charge of criminal battery, the

prosecutor called a witness who testified that he was working as a
bartender at the time and place where the victim was attacked. In
answer to a question by the prosecutor, the witness said that he did not
remember whether he shouted anything immediately before the attack.
The prosecutor showed the defendant's attorney a written report of a
conversation between the witness and an investigator and had it
marked for identification. Then the prosecutor showed the report to the
witness and asked whether it refreshed his recollection. If the
defendant's attorney objects to this procedure, the objection should be

(A) sustained, unless the report has been admitted into evidence.

(B) sustained, because the report is inadmissible hearsay.

(C) overruled, because the witness testified that he did not remember

whether or not he shouted anything prior to the attack.

(D) overruled, but only if the prosecutor offers the report into evidence.

123. During the presentation of plaintiff's direct case in a personal injury
action, the plaintiff's attorney called a doctor to the stand for the
purpose of establishing that the plaintiff had sustained an injury to her
skull.

On direct examination, the doctor testified that after receiving a
positive result in a test known as a skullogram, she concluded that the
plaintiff had sustained an injury to her skull. On cross-examination, the
defendant's attorney showed the doctor a book and asked whether she
relied on it in forming her diagnosis. The doctor stated that she did
not, but she admitted that it was a well-respected work in the field.
The defendant's attorney then asked the doctor to read aloud a passage
from the book that stated that a positive result in a skullogram almost
always indicated that there was no injury to the patient's skull. If the
plaintiff's attorney objects, can that passage be read to the jury?

(A) Yes, for the purpose of impeachment only.

(B) Yes, as substantive evidence only.

(C) Yes, for the purpose of impeachment and as substantive evidence.

665

(D) No.

124. The plaintiff was a passenger in a car driven by the defendant when the
car struck a pole. The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim against
the defendant, alleging that injuries that resulted from the defendant's
negligent driving caused the plaintiff to be hospitalized for more than a
month. At trial, on the presentation of the plaintiff's direct case, the
plaintiff testified that following his release from the hospital, the
defendant's insurance company paid the plaintiff's hospital bill of
$20,000. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, this portion of the
plaintiff's testimony should be

(A) excluded, because the payment of the plaintiff's hospital bill is an

offer of compromise.

(B) excluded.

(C) admitted, because reference to the fact that the defendant was

insured can be severed from the rest of the plaintiff's statement.

(D) admitted, as circumstantial evidence that the defendant regarded

himself to be at fault in causing the accident.

125. The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant for

personal injuries that the plaintiff sustained when she was struck by the
defendant's car while she was a pedestrian. In defense, the defendant
asserted that he was not negligent and that the plaintiff was
contributorily negligent in that she was not in the area designated as a
crosswalk at the time of the accident. The plaintiff's attorney called the
witness as a witness on the plaintiff's behalf.

The witness testified that she held a valid driver's license, that she had
been driving an automobile for 40 years, that she had seen the
defendant's car just before it struck the plaintiff, and that, in her
opinion, it was moving at a speed in excess of the speed limit, 35
miles per hour. If the defendant's attorney objects to the witness's
testimony regarding the speed of the defendant's vehicle, which of the
following would be the most effective argument in support of that
objection?

(A) The witness did not qualify as an expert on the speed of a moving

automobile.

(B) The witness's statement of opinion concerned an ultimate fact in the

litigation.

666

(C) The witness did not have sufficient opportunity to form an opinion

regarding the speed of the defendant's vehicle.

(D) The speed of the defendant's vehicle was a fact, and therefore it

cannot be established by opinion evidence.

126. At the trial of an action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant

for breach of contract, a witness was called by the plaintiff's attorney.
The witness identified the signature on a document as the defendant's,
testifying that he knew the defendant's signature because he and the
defendant had once been partners and that he had seen the defendant's
signature many times during the course of their partnership.

The witness then testified to other matters, and on cross-examination,
the defendant's attorney asked the witness, “Didn't the partnership
between you and the defendant break up because the defendant
accused you of dishonesty?” If the plaintiff's attorney objects to that
question, the objection should be

(A) sustained, because the question seeks to elicit hearsay not within

any exception to the hearsay rule.

(B) overruled, because the question seeks to elicit an admission.

(C) overruled, because the question seeks to elicit evidence that is

admissible for purposes of extrinsic impeachment.

(D) overruled, because the question seeks to elicit evidence that would

tend to establish that the witness is a biased witness.

127. A federal officer had been informed that a person arriving from Europe
on a particular airline flight would be carrying cocaine in his baggage.
The officer went to the airport and stood at the arrival gate with a dog
that had been specially trained to recognize the scent of cocaine. When
the defendant, carrying his bag, walked by, the dog began barking and
scratching the floor in front of him with his right paw. The officer
stopped the defendant and searched his bag. In it, he found a small
brass statue with a false bottom. Upon removing the false bottom, the
officer found one ounce of cocaine. The defendant, who was arrested
and charged with the illegal importation of a controlled substance,
claimed he had purchased the statue as a souvenir and was unaware
that there was cocaine hidden it its base.

At the defendant's trial, the prosecution offered to prove that the

667

defendant had been convicted 15 years earlier of illegally importing
cocaine by hiding it in the base of a brass statue. If the defendant's
attorney objected, the court should rule that proof of the defendant's
prior conviction is

(A) admissible, as evidence of habit.

(B) admissible, because it is evidence of a distinctive method of

operation.

(C) inadmissible, because evidence of previous conduct by a defendant

may not be used against him or her.

(D) inadmissible, because the prior conviction occurred more than 10

years before the trial.

128. The plaintiff was riding a motorcycle manufactured by the defendant
when he collided with an automobile, sustaining serious personal
injuries. He claimed the fork on the motorcycle bent when he was
riding it.

The defendant's attorney attempted to offer a film into evidence. The
film showed a test being conducted on a motorcycle fork identical to
the one on the plaintiff's motorcycle. In the test, the fork was subjected
to the application of more than 15,000 pounds of pressure and did not
bend. However, while the plaintiff's accident took place on a hilly dirt
road, the test took place on a flat test track. If the plaintiff's attorney
objects, the film should be

(A) excluded, because it has not been properly authenticated by the

photographer who made the film.

(B) excluded, because it is not the best evidence of the test that was

performed.

(C) excluded, because the test conditions were not identical to the
conditions that the plaintiff claims existed at the time of the
accident.

(D) admitted.

129. The defendant was charged with murdering the victim, a prominent

union leader, by throwing him off the roof of an office building. At the
defendant's trial, the prosecution offered the testimony of a police
officer who arrived at the scene moments after the victim's death.

668

The prosecuting attorney asked the officer whether he knew the
defendant. The officer said that prior to the death of the victim, he had
arrested the defendant three times for aggravated assault, and that the
defendant had been convicted each time. The prosecutor offered
properly authenticated court records of the convictions. Upon timely
objection by the defendant's attorney, the court should admit into
evidence

(A) the officer's testimony only.

(B) the court records only.

(C) both the officer's testimony and the court records.

(D) neither the officer's testimony nor the court records.

130. The plaintiff sued a hedge fund, claiming the fund made certain trades
he did not think were prudent, resulting in a large financial loss. In
defense, the hedge fund pointed to a state law that limited damages for
trading losses based on a hedge fund trade unless a client protest was
made within 30 days of the trade.

The hedge fund's attorney offered the testimony of one of its managers,
who testified it was his job to note any client protests. He said any
protests were promptly reported to him and noted by him as a matter
of company policy. He said he had searched the relevant file for any
note regarding a protest made by the plaintiff and could not find one.
The hedge fund's attorney then offered the file in evidence. The
plaintiff objected.

The court should

(A) sustain the objection, because the evidence is inadmissible hearsay.

(B) sustain the objection, because the lack of a note does not prove the

plaintiff did not protest the trade.

(C) overrule the objection, because the file was kept by the manager as

a regularly conducted business activity.

(D) overrule the objection, because the file was used to refresh the

manager's recollection.

131. The plaintiff sued the defendant for damages after the defendant hit the
plaintiff with his car while the plaintiff was riding his bicycle. The
plaintiff called his first witness, who had been riding in the car with

669

the defendant, believing he would testify that the defendant was texting
when the accident occurred. However, during the first witness's
testimony, the first witness denied seeing the defendant texting and
said, “I've never claimed anything different!” The plaintiff now wants
to call a second witness. The second witness would testify that the first
witness told her about the accident and said that the defendant was
“texting the entire time and wasn't even looking at the road.”

Is the second witness's testimony admissible?

(A) Yes, to impeach the first witness and to prove the defendant was

texting.

(B) Yes, to impeach the first witness.

(C) No, because it is inadmissible hearsay.

(D) No, because the first witness was testifying for the plaintiff.

132. The defendant was on trial for murder. The defendant wants to testify
that after the murder a witness told her, “I saw the guy that did it.” The
defendant wants to use this statement to prove she did not commit the
murder because she is female. May the defendant do so?

(A) Yes, because it is relevant non-hearsay.

(B) Yes, because it is a declaration against interest.

(C) No, because it is hearsay.

(D) No, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the

danger of unfair prejudice.

ANSWERS TO 
EVIDENCE QUESTIONS

1. A Under both common law and the UCC, evidence of trade terminology is
admissible for the purpose of establishing the meaning of a particular
term in a contract between parties in the trade. Since the contract calls
for the sale of fish at wholesale, evidence of trade terminology used in
the wholesale fish industry is relevant to establish the meaning of the
term in question.

Ordinarily, a witness is not permitted to testify to his or her opinion.
A witness who qualifies as an expert in a particular field, however,
may be permitted to testify to an opinion regarding his or her field of
expertise.  Since  the  chef  is  not  offering  an  opinion  regarding  the
preparation of fried fish in fast food restaurants, he need not qualify
as  an  expert  in  that  particular  field.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is
incorrect  because  even  if  parties  have  not  specifically  agreed  to  be
bound  by  the  terminology  of  a  particular  industry,  that  terminology
may be relevant in determining the meaning of unexplained terms in a
contract so long as both parties are likely to have been aware of the
meaning  of  the  trade  terminology.  D  is  incorrect  because  an  expert
may offer an opinion regarding his or her field of expertise.

2.  C  Damages  in  a  defamation  action  are  supposed  to  compensate  the
plaintiff for an injury to her reputation. Since the injury would be less
severe  if  the  plaintiff's  reputation  was  not  a  good  one  to  begin  with,
evidence of the plaintiff's reputation in the republic is relevant to the
issue of damages and is therefore admissible.

A is incorrect because the evidence was not offered for the purpose
of  proving  that  the  plaintiff  engaged  in  any  particular  conduct.  If
proper, character evidence may, with some limitations, be used in any
litigation,  whether  civil  or  criminal.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect because evidence of reputation is not usually admissible for
the purpose of establishing that the person in question did or did not
act in a particular way on a particular occasion.

3. C The best evidence rule requires production of an original or qualified
duplicate when the terms of a writing are in dispute or when a writing
is  offered  as  evidence  of  a  fact  and  the  writing  is  not  shown  to  be
unavailable.  The  witness's  testimony  can  be  admitted  because  it  was

672

based on her own recollection and was not dependent on the plaintiff's
file  on  the  purchase.  The  copy  can  also  be  admitted  because  a
photocopy is admissible as a qualified duplicate.

4.  D  Under  FRE  401,  evidence  has  to  be  relevant  to  be  admissible.
Relevant  evidence  is  evidence  that  tends  to  make  any  fact  of
consequence  to  the  determination  of  a  case  more  probable  than  it
would  be  without  the  evidence.  Here,  relevant  evidence  would  be
evidence  tending  to  prove  the  university  president  is  not  racist.
However,  the  fact  he  granted  mayor's  request  for  a  donation  to  a
general flood relief fund does not do anything to show he's not a racist.
While minority neighborhoods may have been helped by the donation,
there is no indication he knew minority citizens would receive aid or
that he intended minority citizens to receive aid. At most, the donation
shows  he  is  charitable,  a  question  that  is  not  at  issue.  B is  therefore
incorrect.

A is incorrect because only facts related to the university president's
alleged  racism  may  be  admitted.  Facts  related  to  other  parts  of  his
character are irrelevant. C is incorrect because evidence of specific
acts may be used to prove character under FRE 405(b). However, as
stated  above,  his  donation  does  not  prove  anything  regarding  his
alleged racism.

5. D Hearsay is an out-of-court assertion offered for the purpose of proving
the truth of the matter asserted. Thus, if the plaintiff's statement to the
doctor  is  being  offered  to  prove  that  the  plaintiff  was  experiencing
pain  in  his  arm,  the  statement  would  be  hearsay.  An  exception  to  the
hearsay  rule,  however,  permits  the  admission  of  statements  made  as
part  of  a  medical  history  given  in  connection  with  a  medical
examination made for the purpose of treatment or diagnosis. Since the
doctor's examination was being made for the purpose of diagnosis, the
patient's  statement  should  be  admissible.  Under  FRE  803(4),  the
circumstances  surrounding  the  medical  examination  in  which  a
patient's  statement  was  made  go  to  the  weight  rather  than  to  the
admissibility of that statement. Thus, the fact that the examination was
not  made  for  the  purpose  of  treatment  or  that  it  was  made  in
contemplation  of  litigation  is  not  in  itself  sufficient  to  prevent
admission  unless  the  prejudicial  effect  of  the  statement  is  likely  to
outweigh  its  probative  value.  While  a  court  might  not  come  to  that
conclusion, the argument in D is the only one listed that could possibly

673

support the motion to strike.

A and B are incorrect because unless the probative value is likely to
be outweighed by the prejudicial effect, the fact that the examination
was not being made for the purpose of treatment or that it was being
made in contemplation of litigation would not be sufficient to result in
its exclusion. C is incorrect because there is no rule that prevents the
admission of self-serving statements.

6. D FRE  807  allows  courts  to  admit  hearsay  evidence  that  does  not  fall
within  any  well-defined  exclusion,  if  it  is  highly  reliable  and  badly
needed in the case. There are five requirements: 1. The statement must
have circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness; 2. the statement must
be offered as evidence of a material fact; 3. the statement must be more
probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence
that is available through reasonable efforts; 4. use of the evidence must
be consistent with the general purposes of the FRE and the interests of
justice; and 5. the proponent of the evidence must give notice of his or
her intention to offer the statement sufficiently in advance of the trial or
hearing to provide a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it. However,
because  of  the  Sixth  Amendment's  Confrontation  Clause,  grand  jury
testimony  cannot  be  used  against  a  criminal  defendant  (other  than  the
testifier) unless the testifier takes the stand and is available for cross-
examination.  Here,  since  the  witness  is  not  available  to  be  cross-
examined  by  the  defendant's  lawyer  at  trial,  and  since  the  defendant
did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the time of
the grand jury, the witness's grand jury testimony can't be used against
the defendant.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

7. A Under FRE 801, a statement made by the party's agent or employee on
a matter within the scope of the relationship can be offered against the
opposing  party  as  an  admission.  Such  statements  are  not  considered
hearsay under the Rules. Here, since the man works for the amusement
park,  the  witness's  testimony  regarding  his  statement  can  be  admitted
as  an  admission  of  negligence  in  not  securing  the  plaintiff's  seatbelt.
Therefore, C and D are incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  declaration  against  interest  rule  only
applies when a declarant is unavailable. Here, there is no indication
the rollercoaster operator is not available to testify.

674

8. B  Since  hearsay  is  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  for  the  purpose  of
proving  the  matter  asserted  in  that  statement,  and  since  the  girl's
statement  that  the  defendant  struck  her  is  offered  for  the  purpose  of
proving  that  the  defendant  struck  her,  the  statement  is  hearsay.  FRE
803(2) provides, however, that an excited utterance may be admissible
as an exception to the hearsay rule. An excited utterance is a statement
made about a startling event while the declarant is under stress caused
by the event. The common law equivalent—spontaneous declaration—
could not ordinarily be applied if the statement was made in response
to  a  question.  The  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  have  eliminated  that
condition,  however.  While  the  passage  of  time  might  lead  a  court  to
conclude  that  the  girl  was  no  longer  under  stress  produced  by  the
beating  and  hold  that  the  statement  is  not  admissible,  B  is  the  only
argument  listed  that  could  possibly  be  effective  in  response  to  the
objection.

Although a witness is permitted to make statements regarding her own
sense impressions, and these statements may include identification of
other persons, there is no hearsay exception for such statements when
they are made out of court. A and D are therefore incorrect. Similarly,
while  a  witness  may  make  statements  regarding  her  own  physical
condition, including explanations of the causes for that condition, C is
incorrect because the girl's statement was made out of court and was
not  given  in  connection  with  a  medical  examination  done  for  the
purpose of treatment or diagnosis.

9.  B  The  attorney-client  privilege  applies  to  communications  made  to  an
attorney by a person seeking legal advice. Generally, the privilege of
confidential  communication  with  an  attorney  extends  also  to  the
employees  or  agents  of  that  attorney  who  are  acting  in  furtherance  of
the attorney-client relationship. Some jurisdictions hold that where one
mistakenly  confides  in  another,  believing  the  other  to  be  an  attorney,
there  is  a  privileged  relationship  so  long  as  that  mistaken  belief  was
reasonable.  Thus,  if  the  defendant  reasonably  believed  that  he  was
communicating  with  an  agent  of  his  attorney,  the  conversation  may
have been privileged. While it is not certain that a court would come
to that conclusion, the argument in B is the only one listed that could
possibly support the motion.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  man's  statement  would  not  result  in  a
privilege  unless  the  defendant  was  speaking  with  the  man  for  the

675

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

purpose  of  obtaining  legal  advice.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  man's
offer  would  not  make  disclosure  of  the  facts  to  him  essential  to  the
relationship  between 
the  defendant  and  his  attorney.  Police
interrogation  of  a  person  in  custody  might  violate  the  man's
constitutional rights. Unless the man had been sent by the police for
the purpose of obtaining a statement from the defendant, however, the
fact  that  he  negotiated  a  plea  bargain  on  the  day  that  his  testimony
was  given  would  not  violate  the  defendant's  rights  and  would  not
prevent the man's testimony from being admissible as an admission.
D is therefore incorrect.

10. B  In  many  jurisdictions,  an  expert  witness  may  be  cross-examined  in
reference  to  a  text  not  in  evidence  only  if  his  or  her  opinion  was
based upon it. Under FRE 803(18), it is not necessary to show that the
witness relied on the text involved, but it is necessary to establish that
it  is  a  reliable  authority.  B  is  correct  because  neither  of  these  two
foundations has been laid.

A is incorrect because there is no requirement that the author of a text
used on cross-examination be a witness at the proceeding. C is only
partially  correct,  since  it  is  necessary  to  show  such  works  to  be
reliable  authorities  before  they  can  be  used  in  cross-examination.
Since the doctor's admission that he has heard of the specialist is not
sufficient  to  establish  that  her  work  is  a  reliable  authority,  D  is
incorrect.

11. C Under FRE 609, convictions may be used to impeach the credibility
of  a  witness.  A  court  may  not  exclude  proof  of  such  convictions  if
they are for felonies or for misdemeanors involving dishonesty. Since
attempted  murder  is  a  felony,  and  since  the  other  crime  was  a
misdemeanor involving dishonesty, evidence of both was admissible.

Therefore, A, B, and D are all incorrect.

12. D Hearsay is an out-of-court assertion offered to prove the truth of the
matter asserted. Since the mechanic's statement was made out of court
and is offered to prove the truth of what it asserts, it is inadmissible
as hearsay.

Although  the  record  filed  by  the  inspector  might  qualify  as  either  a
business record or an official document, the transcript that it contains
of  a  statement  made  by  the  mechanic  makes  this  a  multiple  hearsay
problem. While the record itself might be admissible under one of the

676

two named exceptions to the hearsay rule, only that information that
was within the inspector's personal knowledge may be admitted. The
fact  that  either  the  declarant  or  the  person  who  made  the  record  is
dead is not in itself sufficient to make the statement admissible. A and
B are therefore incorrect. Under both the common law and FRE 
801(d)(2)(D),  a  statement  by  an  employee  may  be  admissible  as  a
vicarious admission of the employer only if the statement was made
within 
the  employment
relationship existed. Since the mechanic had been discharged before
making the statement in question, C is incorrect.

the  scope  of  employment  and  while 

13. D  Under  FRE  901(5),  voice  identification  can  be  made  by  a  witness
who  testifies  that  he  or  she  properly  dialed  a  number  listed  in  the
telephone  book,  and  that  circumstances  including  self-identification
show that the person listed was the one who answered.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Since  the  defendant's  statement  is
contrary  to  his  interests,  it  is  an  admission,  which  is  not  hearsay
under  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  and  is  admissible  as  an
exception  to  the  hearsay  rule  under  common  law.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.

14. A Although evidence of insurance is not admissible for the purpose of
showing fault or wrongful conduct, it is admissible for other purposes
if relevant to them. Evidence is logically relevant if it tends to prove
or disprove a fact of consequence. Since a person would probably not
purchase liability insurance on a vehicle that he or she does not own,
the fact that the defendant purchased the policy and that it was in force
on the day of the accident tends to establish that she was the owner of
the  vehicle  on  that  day.  It  is  thus  relevant  to  the  issue  of  ownership
and therefore admissible.

B  is  incorrect  since  a  defendant's  ability  to  pay  a  judgment  against
him  or  her  is  not  relevant  to  either  liability  or  damages  in  a
negligence  case.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  policy  mentioned
prevents such evidence only if offered to establish fault or wrongful
conduct.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  evidence  tends  to  establish
ownership, which has been disputed by the defendant.

15.  A  Under  FRE  803(3),  declarations  of  a  declarant's  then-existing
intentions are described as statements of present state of mind and are
admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule. They may be relevant to

677

establish  that  the  declarant  acted  in  a  way  that  was  consistent  with
those  stated  intentions;  however,  such  evidence  is  relevant  only  to
establish  the  conduct  of  the  declarant  himself  or  herself.  The  view
taken by the majority and by the FRE is that they are not relevant to
establish  the  conduct  of  others.  Courts  generally  admit  such
statements  with  limiting  instructions  directing  the  jury  to  consider
them only on the issue of the declarant's actions.

B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

16. B Under FRE 803(2), a statement relating to a startling event that was
made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement from that
event  is  admissible  under  the  excited  utterance  exception  to  the
hearsay rule.

A is incorrect because the uncertainty of the identification goes to the
weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility. C is incorrect
because a statement may be admissible as an excited utterance even
though  the  identity  of  the  person  making  it  is  unknown.  An  excited
utterance is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule whether or
not other evidence is available. D is therefore incorrect.

17. D Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the
truth of the matter asserted in that statement. Since the publisher can
only be offering the bartender's statement to prove that the journalist
believed in his story, it is hearsay.

A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect, because under FRE 803(3), a
statement  of  a  declarant's  past  state  of  mind  is  admissible  only  in  a
will contest. That a statement is self-serving may keep it from being
admitted under certain exceptions to the hearsay rule, but it is never
grounds for its admission. C is therefore incorrect.

18. C Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the
matter asserted in that statement. If offered for any other purpose, it is
not hearsay. If an out-of-court statement has a direct legal effect apart
from its communicative effect, it is not hearsay since it is offered not
to prove the truth of any matter asserted but to prove its direct legal
effect.  Since  the  defendant  is  attempting  to  establish  that  the  watch
was a gift to him, and since the patient's words coupled with delivery
by  handing  the  defendant  the  watch  would  have  the  legal  effect  of
creating an executed gift, the statement is admissible.

An admission is a statement made by a party and offered against that

678

party. Since the patient is not a party to the proceeding, his statement
cannot  be  termed  an  admission.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  Dead
Man's Act, where it exists, prevents evidence of a conversation with
a decedent from being offered against the interests of that decedent. B
is incorrect, however, since the Dead Man's Act, if it existed, would
require  that  the  objection  be  sustained,  not  overruled.  The  patient's
statement  was  not  hearsay  since  it  is  offered  to  establish  its  direct
legal  effect  apart  from  its  communicative  effect.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

19. D Most modern courts, and FRE 701, allow laypersons to give opinions
regarding  matters  within  the  competence  of  the  ordinary  person  so
long  as  a  proper  foundation  is  laid.  This  foundation  requires  a
showing that the witness had experience that would enable him or her
to form an opinion, that he or she had an opportunity to perceive, and
that he or she formed an opinion based on that perception. Since the
officer has so testified, her testimony regarding the defendant's speed
should be admitted as a lay opinion.

A and B are therefore incorrect. Although some police officers might
qualify  as  experts  on  the  speeds  of  moving  vehicles,  C  is  incorrect
for two reasons: First, a witness to the speed of a vehicle need not be
an expert, and second, not all police officers qualify as experts.

20. D  Under  FRE  412,  reputation  evidence  of  the  past  sexual  behavior  of
the  victim  is  not  admissible  in  a  trial  for  rape  under  any
circumstances. Evidence of the victim's past is not admissible except
for  conduct  with  the  defendant  offered  to  support  a  defense  of
consent,  or  conduct  with  others  offered  to  show  that  the  defendant
was  not  the  source  of  semen  or  the  victim's  injury.  Since  the  court
record is not offered for these purposes, it is not admissible.

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

A  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  Under  the  FRE,  evidence  of
conviction for a crime is admissible for the purpose of impeaching a
witness's  credibility  if  the  crime  was  a  felony  or  a  misdemeanor
involving  dishonesty.  Since  prostitution  is  neither,  the  conviction  is
not  admissible  to  impeach  the  victim's  credibility.  B  is  therefore
incorrect.

21. C Evidence of past dealings between the parties to a contract is usually
admissible  to  prove  the  intentions  of  the  parties  at  the  time  the
contract  was  formed.  This  is  only  so,  however,  if  conditions  at  the

679

time  the  previous  dealings  took  place  are  substantially  the  same  as
conditions  that  existed  at  the  time  the  contract  was  formed.  If  the
DVDs were being sold at an especially low price, evidence of past
sales  at  the  regular  price  might  not  be  relevant  in  determining  the
intentions of the parties.

the 

introduction  of  oral 

A  is  incorrect  because  the  evidence  is  not  being  offered  for  the
purpose  of  establishing  the  company's  conduct,  but  rather  for  the
purpose of establishing the store's intentions. The parol evidence rule
testimony  of  prior  or
prohibits 
contemporaneous  agreements  for  the  purpose  of  contradicting  the
terms  of  an  unambiguous  written  contract.  B  is  incorrect,  however,
since  the  absence  of  any  reference  to  the  way  in  which  the  product
was  to  be  packaged  would  make  the  contract  ambiguous,  and  oral
evidence  could  be  offered  to  explain  the  ambiguity.  D  is  incorrect
because  the  common  practice  would  not  in  itself  be  sufficient  to
overcome  the  expectations  that  might  have  resulted  from  past
transactions between the parties.

22. A Evidence that a party is insured is inadmissible to establish fault or
damage because insurance coverage or the lack of it is not logically
or  legally  relevant  to  those  issues.  For  this  reason,  it  is  ordinarily
improper  for  either  party  to  comment  on  insurance  or  the  lack  of  it
during  the  trial  of  a  negligence  action.  If  a  plaintiff  falsely  suggests
that the defendant is insured, however, a defendant may be permitted
to  counter  the  suggestion  by  proving  that  he  lacked  insurance.  Since
the  plaintiff's  attorney  asked  jurors  whether  they  owned  stock  in  an
automobile  liability  insurance  carrier,  a  court  might  conclude  that  a
false  suggestion  of  insurance  coverage  has  been  made  and  that  the
defendant  should  therefore  be  permitted  to  prove  that  he  had  none.
While it is not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, A is
the only option that could possibly be correct.

B is incorrect because the evidence involved was not offered for the
purpose  of  establishing  fault  or  freedom  from  it.  C  is  incorrect
because  there  is  no  prohibition  against  the  offer  of  evidence  that  is
self-serving  (a  party's  evidence  almost  always  is).  The  FRE
specifically authorize the admission of a judgment of conviction when
it is relevant. D is therefore incorrect.

23. D If relevant, photographs and films are admissible if a witness testifies
that  they  are  accurate  representations  of  what  they  purport  to  be.

680

Since  the  defendant  has  identified  the  videotape  copy  as  a  fair  and
accurate  representation  of  the  accident  scene,  and  since  the
appearance of the accident scene is relevant in the trial of an accident
claim, the videotape is admissible and D is correct.

Under  the  best  evidence  (i.e.,  original  document)  rule,  where  the
contents  of  a  document  are  in  issue,  secondary  evidence  of  its
contents is inadmissible unless the original or a qualified duplicate is
shown to be unavailable. Although a videotape could be regarded as
a  document  for  this  purpose,  A  is  incorrect  because  the  contents  of
the  videotape  are  not  in  issue;  the  tape  is  offered  to  show  what  the
accident scene looked like. Since the defendant testified that the tape
is  an  accurate  representation  of  the  accident  scene,  it  is  admissible
without  regard  to  its  custody  and  whereabouts  since  made.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  any  witness  may
authenticate  a  pictorial  representation  by  testifying  that  it  is  an
accurate representation of what it purports to be.

24. D Since a person who makes statements that contradict each other might
not  be  worthy  of  belief,  a  witness  may  be  impeached  on  cross-
examination by inquiry regarding prior inconsistent statements.

If a prior inconsistent statement is offered as substantive evidence, it
must  have  been  made  under  oath  and  at  a  trial.  But  a  prior
inconsistent statement used merely to impeach does not need to fulfill
those requirements. Since only impeachment use is being made here,
A is incorrect. Although it may be unethical for an attorney to make
contact  directly  with  an  adversary  known  to  be  represented  by
counsel,  information  obtained  by  such  a  contact  is  not  necessarily
inadmissible. In any event, B is incorrect because there is no reason
to believe that the plaintiff was represented by counsel at the time of
his conversation with the investigator, or, if he was, that the attorney
knew  him  to  be.  A  statement  of  a  party  offered  against  that  party  is
admissible  as  an  admission.  Under  FRE  801(d)(2),  an  admission  is
not hearsay; under the common law, an admission is an exception to
the hearsay rule. C is therefore incorrect.

25. B  Under  FRE  410(4),  a  withdrawn  guilty  plea  cannot  be  used  in  any
subsequent  action  or  proceeding,  so  if  the  plea  was  withdrawn,  the
buyer's attorney can properly be prevented from asking about it.

A  and  C  are  incorrect  because  the  circumstances  and  the  crime  to

681

which  the  plea  was  given  go  to  the  weight  rather  than  to  the
admissibility  of 
the
impeachment  of  the  seller's  witness  does  not  depend  on  the  seller's
employment of that witness.

incorrect  because 

the  evidence.  D 

is 

26.  C  Because  of  a  policy  to  encourage  repairs  of  dangerous  conditions,
evidence  that  a  defendant  repaired  a  condition  subsequent  to  the
occurrence  of  an  accident  is  inadmissible  for  the  purpose  of
establishing  negligence  or  that  the  condition  was  dangerous  at  the
time of the accident.

A  is  incorrect  for  that  reason,  and  because  the  term  admission
ordinarily describes an out-of-court statement made by a party. B is
incorrect  because  the  rule  of  policy  applies  whether  or  not  the
defendant has received notice of the accident and pending lawsuit. D
is incorrect because it is over-inclusive. Such evidence is admissible
for some purposes (like establishing ownership or control).

27.  C  Since  an  employer  is  vicariously  liable  for  the  negligence  of  an
employee  committed  within  the  scope  of  employment,  statements
tending  to  establish  that  the  accident  resulted  from  the  employee's
negligence are relevant in the plaintiff's action against the defendant.
The  evidence  should  thus  be  admitted  unless  excluded  under  the
hearsay rule. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the
truth  of  the  matter  asserted.  These  facts  raise  what  is  sometimes
called a multiple-level hearsay problem (i.e., a problem involving an
out-of-court  statement  that  contains  another  out-of-court  statement).
This  is  so  because  the  employee's  testimony  at  the  reckless  driving
trial  was  not  made  during  the  negligence  trial  and  so  is  an  “out-of-
court”  statement,  and  because  the  evidence  of  his  statement  is
contained  in  a  transcript  that  was  also  not  made  as  part  of  the
negligence  trial  and  so  is  an  “out-of-court”  statement.  For  multiple-
level hearsay (i.e., the transcript containing the employee's statement)
to be admissible, each level must be separately admissible. The first
level  of  hearsay  is  the  testimony  by  the  employee  at  the  reckless
driving trial. Under 
the  common  law,  statements  by  an  employee  are  admissible  against
the employer only if the employee had the authority to make them. But
FRE 801(d)(2)(D) requires only that 
the  employee's  statement  concerned  a  matter  within  the  scope  of  his
or her employment and was made while the employment relationship

682

existed. The employee's statement is therefore a vicarious admission,
which is an exception to the hearsay rule at common law and is not
hearsay  at  all  under  the  FRE.  The  second  level  of  hearsay  is  the
transcript. Since it was made by a public official (the court reporter),
regarding  “matters  observed  pursuant  to  duty  imposed  by  law  as  to
which matters there was a duty to report” (that the employee made the
admission), the transcript qualifies as a public record or report under
FRE 803(8). C is therefore correct.

Under FRE 804(b)(1), prior testimony is admissible as an exception
to the hearsay rule only if the party against whom it is offered had an
incentive  and  an  opportunity  to  cross-examine  when  the  testimony
was first given. Since the defendant was not a party to the proceeding
at which the employee's testimony was given, the testimony does not
qualify for admission under this exception. A  is  therefore  incorrect.
The past recollection recorded exception requires that the record was
made  from  the  recorder's  own  knowledge  and  requires  the  recorder
to  authenticate  the  record  in  court.  B  is  incorrect  because  the
employee's  statement  was  not  authenticated  or  recorded  by  the
employee. D is incorrect for the reasons stated above.

28.  B  Under  the  attorney-client  privilege,  the  client  has  a  right  not  to
disclose (and the right to prevent his or her attorney from disclosing)
any  confidential  communication  between  the  attorney  and  the  client
relating to the professional relationship. However, the privilege does
not  apply  to  a  communication  that  is  related  to  carrying  out  a  future
crime  or  wrong.  Here,  the  communication  relates  to  the  defendant's
apparent plan to shoot the victim, which was then carried out.

The attorney-client privilege applies to a professional attorney-client
relationship.  Importantly,  such  a  relationship  does  not  require  the
paying  of  a  fee.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  and  D  are  incorrect
because although the lawyer gave the defendant legal advice and the
conversation between them was confidential, it involved the carrying
out of a future crime.

29. C Under FRE 803(3), statements of a declarant's then-existing state of
mind  are  admissible  as  an  exception  to  the  hearsay  rule.  Since  it  is
likely  that  a  suicidal  state  of  mind  such  as  that  indicated  by  the
victim's  statement  to  the  psychiatrist  would  continue  until  the
following  day,  and  since  it  is  likely  that  a  person  with  that  state  of
mind would commit suicide, the fact that the victim was of a suicidal

683

state of mind on the day before his death is relevant to the question of
whether his death was a suicide. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement
offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in that statement. If the
victim's  statement  to  the  psychiatrist  is  offered  for  the  purpose  of
establishing that the psychiatrist knew or should have known that the
victim was suicidal, it is not hearsay since it is not offered to prove
the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that suicide is the only way out).

30. B Under FRE 803(18), statements contained in a published treatise may
be called to the attention of an expert on direct examination or cross-
examination,  and,  if  the  treatise  is  established  to  be  a  reliable
authority,  may  be  read  into  the  record.  To  prevent  the  jury  from
misunderstanding and misapplying a work written by and for experts,
however, the treatise itself is not admissible.

A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

31. D Under FRE 408, offers of compromise are excluded as evidence and
cannot  be  used  to  prove  or  disprove  the  validity  or  amount  of  any
disputed  claim.  Here,  there  is  clearly  a  disputed  claim  since  the
plaintiff and defendant are in court regarding potential liability for the
automobile accident.

A party admission is any statement made by a party to a lawsuit that
another party wants to use as evidence against that party. Here, while
the  plaintiff's  statement  is  clearly  a  party  admission,  it  is  excluded
under  FRE  408  because  the  plaintiff  offered  to  compromise  by
dismissing  the  suit  for  $10,000.  Therefore,  A  is  incorrect.  A
declaration  against  interest  is  a  statement  made  by  an  unavailable
declarant. This is an exception to the hearsay rule. Here, there is no
indication  the  plaintiff  is  not  available.  Therefore,  B  is  incorrect.
Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in court to prove the truth
of  the  matter  asserted.  Here,  the  issue  is  that  the  plaintiff  offered
$10,000 to dismiss the case, not whether the statement was hearsay or
not. Therefore, C is incorrect.

32.  C  Under  FRE  608(a),  attempts  to  prove  a  defendant's  character  for
truthfulness  with  opinion  evidence  regarding  honesty  are  not
admissible  unless  the  defendant's  character  for  truthfulness  has  been
attacked. Even though the defendant testified in her own defense and
claimed she didn't vandalize the monument, there is no indication that
the  defendant's  character  has  been  attacked.  Therefore,  A, B,  and  D

684

are incorrect.

33. D Although evidence of subsequent repairs is inadmissible to establish
that a condition was dangerous or that the defendant was negligent, it
may be admitted if relevant to some other issue. Since it is not likely
that the landlord would have taken the action indicated if he were not
in  control  of  the  stairway,  the  evidence  may  be  admitted  for  the
purpose of establishing control.

A is incorrect because it suggests that some rule of privilege prevents
testimony by the defendant's employee, when no such rule exists. The
admissibility of the manager's testimony does not, therefore, depend
on his employment status. B and C are incorrect because of the policy
rule that prohibits evidence of subsequent repairs to establish fault.

34. A Silence may be regarded as a tacit admission of a fact asserted in the
presence of the person remaining silent under circumstances such that
a reasonable person would have denied the assertion. Evidence of the
defendant's  refusal  to  answer  the  plaintiff's  assertion  is  therefore
admissible  as  an  admission  so  long  as  a  reasonable  person  would
have denied the assertion.

If  it  were  not  otherwise  admissible,  however,  the  mere  fact  that  the
defendant was a party and able to deny it would not be sufficient to
make  the  testimony  admissible.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is
incorrect  because  silence  may  constitute  an  admission  as  stated
above.  The  Fifth  Amendment  privilege  against  self-incrimination
might  prevent  an  inference  of  guilt  from  being  drawn  in  a  criminal
case from the silence of a defendant, but it does not prevent such an
inference from being drawn in a civil case. D is therefore incorrect.

35.  C  Under  the  best  evidence  rule,  where  the  terms  of  a  writing  are  in
issue,  the  writing  itself  must  be  offered  into  evidence  unless  the
writing  is  shown  to  be  unavailable  through  no  action  in  bad  faith.
Since the original and all copies of the contract were destroyed in a
fire, oral testimony as to its contents is admissible.

The  parol  evidence  rule  prohibits  oral  testimony  of  prior  or
contemporaneous agreements to alter the terms of a contract intended
to be a complete integration of the parties, but it does not prevent oral
testimony  regarding  the  contents  of  a  written  agreement.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  writing  has  been
shown to be unavailable. The Statute of Frauds provides that certain

685

contracts are unenforceable unless in writing, but it does not relate to
the  evidence  used  to  establish  the  existence  of  a  contract.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

inconsistent  with  the  witness's  trial  testimony  and  was  given  under
oath  subject  to  the  penalty  of  perjury  at  a  trial,  hearing,  or  other
proceeding,  or  in  a  deposition.  Importantly,  a  prior  inconsistent
statement  that  was  not  made  under  oath,  or  not  given  at  a  formal
proceeding,  is  not  substantively  admissible.  In  that  case,  the  prior
inconsistent  statement  can  be  used  for  impeachment  purposes  only.
Here, the witness's statement was not made under oath or in any type
of proceeding—it was made the day after the accident to her neighbor
in the backyard, so it can only be used to impeach the witness. A and
“Circumstantial  guarantees  of
C 
trustworthiness” come into play when determining whether FRE 807's
residual exception applies. Therefore, D is incorrect.

are 

37. C The defense of entrapment applies if the police were responsible for
inducing  the  defendant  to  commit  a  crime  that  he  was  not  otherwise
likely  to  commit,  and  it  does  not  apply  if  the  defendant  was
predisposed  to  commit  the  crime  charged.  Since  the  defendant  has
raised the defense of entrapment, evidence that he had previously sold
heroin is relevant to establish his predisposition to do so at the time
when the officer made the purchase.

Although  character  evidence  is  not  admissible  for  the  purpose  of
showing that a criminal defendant committed a certain act, it may be
admissible  against  him  or  her  for  other  purposes.  A  is  therefore
incorrect. B is incorrect because the evidence was being offered not
to establish the defendant's character but to establish that the officer
provided  the  opportunity  for  the  crime  (which  is  not  entrapment)
rather than that he induced the defendant to commit it (which would
have  been  entrapment).  D  is  incorrect  because  character  evidence
may not be used for that purpose.

38.  D  Since  an  attorney  is  entitled  to  control  the  direction  of  his  or  her
examination, an answer that is otherwise admissible may be stricken
if it is not responsive to the question asked. Since the supermarket's
attorney did not ask why the plaintiff delayed consulting with counsel,
the plaintiff's explanation is unresponsive to the question and may be

686

stricken. D is therefore correct.

Although  policy  prevents  admission  of  settlement  negotiations  to
prove damage, the rule of limited admissibility permits admission of
such  evidence  if  it  is  offered  for  some  other  purpose,  such  as  to
explain  the  delay  in  instituting  an  action.  A  is  incorrect,  however,
because  although  otherwise  admissible,  that  portion  of  the  answer
may be stricken as unresponsive. B is incorrect because a policy rule
specifically prohibits the admission of settlement negotiations for the
purpose of establishing fault. C  is  incorrect  because  the  policy  rule
does not apply if the evidence is offered for a proper purpose.

39.  B  At  one  time,  the  courts  recognized  a  prohibition  against  opinion
testimony  relating  to  an  ultimate  issue  in  the  case  on  trial.  Now,
however,  it  is  recognized  that  such  testimony  may  be  admitted  in
evidence so long as the opinion is not couched in legal terms. Since
the  word  obscene  has  special  legal  significance,  the  professor  may
not state an opinion that the film was obscene.

A is incorrect for the reason stated above. C is not the best argument.
Since a witness may qualify as an expert by a showing of his or her
knowledge,  skill,  experience,  training,  or  education  in  a  particular
area, the fact that the witness is a professor of film arts and an author
of several books on the topic of erotic filmmaking would probably be
sufficient to qualify her as an expert. D is incorrect because FRE 702
abandons the requirement of strict necessity for expert testimony and
permits it whenever the witness's specialized knowledge will assist
the jury to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.

40.  C  Although  the  Fifth  Amendment  privilege  against  self-incrimination
protects a witness in a civil or criminal case against being required to
give  testimony  that  might  tend  to  incriminate  him  or  her,  it  does  not
justify a complete refusal to take the stand except by a defendant in a
criminal prosecution.

The  privilege  applies  to  any  testimony  anywhere  if  it  might
subsequently be used in a criminal proceeding against the person who
gave it. A and B are therefore incorrect. D  is  incorrect  because  the
bookkeeper's  belief  would  justify  his  refusal  to  answer  certain
questions, but not his complete refusal to take the stand.

41.  A  Certain  prior  inconsistent  statements  of  a  trial  witness  are
is

the  witness's  prior  statement 

substantively  admissible 

if 

687

inconsistent  with  the  witness's  trial  testimony  and  was  given  under
oath  subject  to  the  penalty  of  perjury  at  a  trial,  hearing,  or  other
proceeding,  or  in  a  deposition.  Here,  because  the  prior  inconsistent
statement was made at a deposition, it is substantively admissible to
prove the truth of the matter asserted. B is therefore incorrect. While
the  statement  may  be  necessary  in  the  interests  of  justice,  that
consideration  comes  into  play  when  courts  determine  whether  the
residual exception might apply. C is therefore incorrect. A statement
against  interest  references  declarations  which,  at  the  time  they  are
made, are so against the declarant's interest that it is unlikely that they
would have been made if they were not true. Here, as far as the facts
provided  in  the  question  go,  the  witness's  prior  statement  seems  to
have nothing to do with her own interests. D is therefore incorrect.

42. D Evidence is admissible if relevant, and relevant if it tends to prove or
disprove  a  fact  of  consequence.  Since  the  defendant  could  not  have
committed the crime if he was elsewhere at the time, evidence of his
whereabouts tends to establish his guilt or innocence and is therefore
relevant.

A and B are incorrect statements because FRE 607 expressly permits
a party to impeach his or her own witness. A hostile witness is one
who manifests hostility to the attorney questioning him or her, not just
one who gives unexpected answers. Since the friend did not manifest
hostility, C is incorrect.

43. A  Hearsay  is  a  statement,  other  than  one  made  by  the  declarant  while
testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth
of the matter asserted. Here, the woman's statement is hearsay since it
is  being  offered  to  prove  that  the  defendant  really  did  murder  the
doctor.  The  statement  is  not  admissible  under  the  excited-utterance
exception  because  the  man's  statement  did  not  relate  to  the  event
causing the man's stress and excitement (namely, the car wreck). B is
therefore  incorrect.  The  statement  is  not  admissible  under  the  dying
declaration  exception  because  it  doesn't  concern  the  cause  or
circumstances  of  the  declarant's  impending  death.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.  A  “present  sense  impression”  refers  to  circumstances
where the statement is describing or explaining an event or condition
made  while  the  declarant  was  perceiving  the  event  or  condition,  or
immediately thereafter. D is therefore incorrect.

44. D A client is privileged to prevent another from disclosing the contents

688

of a confidential communication with his or her attorney. Although the
presence  of  third  persons  usually  results  in  a  finding  that  the
communication  was  not  intended  to  be  confidential,  this  is  not  so  if
the  presence  of  those  persons  was  essential  to  the  communications
with  the  attorney.  The  driver's  presence  does  not  prevent  the
president's  communication  with  the  attorney  from  being  confidential
since, as the driver of the truck, she was essential to the conference
between the president and the attorney.

A  is  incorrect  since  if  the  communication  was  confidential,  the
client's privilege applies to any attempt to disclose it. B is incorrect
because  the  driver's  presence  was  essential  to  the  purpose  of  the
conference.  C  is  incorrect  because  corporations  are  entitled  to  the
privilege, which clearly applies to communications between lawyers
and high-ranking officers of the corporation.

45. A Under FRE 901(b)(6), voice identification can be made if the witness
testifies that she properly dialed a number listed in the directory and

B  is  a  fabrication;  although  the  combination  of  a  listing  in  the
telephone  directory  and  self-identification  by  the  person  answering
the phone may result in an inference regarding that person's identity,
there  is  no  presumption  that  the  person  who  answered  identified
himself  or  herself  accurately.  C  is  incorrect  since  the  FRE  make
independent 
the  circumstances
described  above.  The  privilege  against  self-incrimination  protects
against “testimonial communications” but does not prevent testimony
by  others  than  the  defendant  concerning  admissions  made  by  the
defendant. D is therefore incorrect.

recognition  unnecessary  under 

46.  A  Cross-examination  is  normally  limited  to  the  subject  matter  of  the
direct  examination  and  matters  concerning  the  credibility  of  the
witness.  The  court  does  have  discretion  to  allow  cross-examination
that goes beyond the scope of direct, but judges are extremely unlikely
to  allow  questions  that  will  disturb  a  party's  tactical  decisions  in
presenting his or her case. Here, the plaintiff has decided to use the
defendant's  testimony  only  to  establish  that  the  defendant  did  the
operation.  Consequently,  the  objection  should  be  sustained  for  this
reason. B is therefore incorrect.

689

C is  incorrect  because  the  examiner's  question  does  not  have  to  do
with credibility. D is incorrect because the question goes outside the
scope  of  direct  since  the  defendant  was  only  asked  one  question  on
direct that only involved whether he was the one who did the surgery.

47. A  Under  FRE  803's  excited  utterance  exception  to  the  hearsay  rule,  a
statement made during or soon after a startling event is admissible so
long as the declarant makes the statement while the declarant is still
excited by the event. Here, seeing the defendant covered in blood and
saying  he  shot  his  wife  is  clearly  a  startling  event,  and  the  fact  the
neighbor  shouted  the  statement  while  banging  on  the  witness's  door
shows she was still under the stress of the excitement. Therefore, C
and D are incorrect.

B is incorrect because FRE 803 does not require an excited declarant
be unavailable to testify.

48. A Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the
matter asserted in that statement. Since the statement that a blue sedan
was traveling at an excessive speed was made out of court, and since
it was offered to prove that the defendant's blue sedan was traveling
at an excessive speed, it is hearsay. A is therefore correct.

A witness may testify to his or her sense impression, even though that
testimony is stated as an opinion. Since the witness is not testifying to
her  own  sense  impression  but  rather  to  something  that  she  heard
another  person  say,  B  is  incorrect.  Under  the  hearsay  exception
known  as  “past  recollection  recorded,”  a  witness  may  read  from  a
written  note  if  he  or  she  made  it  himself  or  herself  based  on
information that he or she knew of his or her own knowledge while
the information was fresh in his or her mind. The note that the witness
read  does  not  qualify,  however,  because  it  was  not  based  on
something  that  she  knew  of  her  own  knowledge  but  rather  on
something she had heard another person say. C is therefore incorrect.
A  witness  may  refresh  his  or  her  recollection  while  testifying  by
examining  almost  anything  that  will  have  that  effect.  He  or  she  may
then testify from his or her refreshed recollection, but only if his or
her  testimony  is  otherwise  admissible.  Since  the  statement  to  which
the witness is attempting to testify is hearsay, it is inadmissible and is
not made admissible by the fact that she refreshed her recollection by
looking at a writing. D is therefore incorrect.

690

49. A Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the
truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  that  statement.  Since  the  defendant's
statement  that  the  light  was  red  was  made  out  of  court,  and  since  it
apparently was offered to prove that the light was red, it is  hearsay
and therefore inadmissible. Although the defendant may testify to facts
that  he  knows  of  his  own  knowledge  (i.e.,  that  the  light  was  red
against  the  plaintiff),  he  may  not  testify  to  an  out-of-court  statement
for  the  purpose  of  proving  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  that
statement (i.e., hearsay).

Since his testimony is not that the light was red but rather that he told
the police officer that it was red, B is incorrect. Evidence of a prior
consistent  statement  may  be  admissible  to  rebut  a  claim  of  recent
fabrication. C  is  incorrect,  however,  because  there  is  no  indication
that the plaintiff has claimed that the defendant's statement about the
color of the light is a recent fabrication. Hearsay is inadmissible even
though  the  declarant  is  present  in  court  and  available  for  cross-
examination. D is therefore incorrect.

50. D Under FRE 412, a rape victim's past sexual conduct is generally not
admissible  in  a  prosecution  for  her  rape.  An  exception  is  made,
however, for evidence of past sexual conduct between the defendant
and the complainant if offered to support the defense of consent. Since
evidence regarding past sexual conduct between the defendant and the
victim  might  tend  to  support  the  defendant's  assertion  that  he
reasonably believed that the victim consented, it should be admitted.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
complainant's  past  sexual  conduct  does  not  ordinarily  tend  to
establish  that  defendant  did  or  did  not  have  sexual  intercourse  with
her against her will on the occasion in question.

51.  A  The  law  seeks  to  encourage  safety  precautions  by  prohibiting
evidence  of  subsequent  remedial  measures  from  being  used  for  the
purpose of showing fault. Such evidence may be admissible for other
purposes, however. Here, the defendant had denied ownership of the
vehicle.  Since  it  is  unlikely  that  anyone  other  than  the  owner  would
arrange to have the brakes overhauled, the testimony of the mechanic
is  relevant  to  establish  the  defendant's  ownership  and  should
therefore be admitted.

B is incorrect because of the above-stated policy rule. C is incorrect

691

because the evidence is being used to establish that the defendant was
the owner of the vehicle, not to establish the condition of the brakes.
D  is  incorrect  since  the  evidence  is  admissible  to  establish
ownership.

52. D Evidence is relevant if it would tend to establish a fact in issue. If the
tape  would  tend  to  prove  that  the  defendant  was  the  robber,  it  is
logically relevant. It should, therefore, be excluded only if it violates
some other rule of evidence or if its probative value is substantially
outweighed by its prejudicial impact.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  privilege  against  self-incrimination
applies  only  to  “testimonial  communications”  and  does  not  prevent
evidence based on observations of the defendant. Whether or not it is
certain that the person pictured in the videotape was the defendant is
a  question  for  the  jury.  The  robber's  skin  coloring  (like  his  height,
weight,  and  walk)  is  relevant  to  his  identification.  Since  there  are
many people with the same skin color, the fact that the robber's was
the  same  as  the  defendant's  is  not  in  itself  enough  to  result  in
prejudice  that  outweighs  the  probative  value  of  the  videotape.  B  is
therefore incorrect. An admission by conduct is an act by a defendant
from  which  the  logical  inference  may  be  drawn  that  he  or  she
believes himself or herself to be criminally liable. Usually, it refers
to  flight,  the  use  of  an  assumed  name,  fabrication  of  evidence,  or
some other act committed after the crime. C is therefore incorrect.

53. D  Hearsay  is  a  statement,  other  than  one  made  by  the  declarant  while
testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth
of the matter asserted. Here, the witness is repeating the victim's out-
of-court  statement,  and  the  statement  is  being  used  to  prove  the
defendant was the assailant.

A is incorrect because the “excited utterance” exception only applies
when  the  statement  relates  to  a  startling  event  or  condition,  and  the
statement  is  made  while  the  declarant  is  still  under  the  stress  of
excitement caused by the event or condition. B is  incorrect  because
the  “present  sense  impression”  exception  is  an  exception  for
statements describing or explaining an event or condition made while
the  declarant  is  perceiving  the  event  or  condition,  or  immediately
thereafter.  Here,  the  statement  was  made  two  days  later,  so  the
witness  was  no  longer  under  the  stress  of  excitement  caused  by  the
event,  nor  was  the  witness  describing  the  event  while  the  witness

692

was  perceiving  it.  The  “declaration  against  interest”  exception
applies when the declaration, at the time it is made, is so against the
declarant's  interest  that  it  is  unlikely  it  would  have  been  made  if  it
was  not  true.  Importantly,  the  exception  involves  looking  at  the
declarant's interest, and this answer choice is asking you to consider
the defendant's interest instead of the witness's interest. C is therefore
incorrect.

54.  A  Hearsay  is  defined  as  an  out-of-court  assertion  offered  for  the
purpose  of  proving  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted.  The  fact  that  a
witness made a prior contradictory statement is relevant to his or her
credibility  as  a  witness,  whether  or  not  the  prior  statement  was
actually true, since people who tell different stories on different days
may  not  be  worthy  of  belief.  If  offered  for  that  purpose,  and  not  to
prove the absence of gunshots, the officer's testimony is not hearsay. If
offered  to  prove  that  there  were  no  gunshots  (i.e.,  as  substantive
evidence), however, it is hearsay.

B and C are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect, since for purposes of
impeachment, the statement is not hearsay because it is not offered to
prove the truth of what it asserted.

55.  C  Former  testimony  is  admissible  if  it  was  given  under  oath  by  a
presently  unavailable  declarant  in  a  proceeding  where  the  party
against  which  it  is  now  offered  had  an  opportunity  and  incentive  to
cross-examine. Since the inspector did not respond to the subpoena,
he  is  presently  unavailable.  Since  his  testimony  was  given  at  a
criminal prosecution of the corporation, at which the corporation had
opportunity  and  incentive  to  cross-examine,  the  former  testimony  is
admissible. Although the facts do not indicate how the inspector knew
that the driver was intoxicated or why he was permitted to so testify
at the criminal negligence trial, C is the only reason listed that could
result in the admission of his statement.

An  admission  is  a  statement  made  by  a  party  that  is  offered  against
that  party.  Since  the  inspector  is  not  a  party,  A  is  incorrect.  A  past
recollection recorded must have been prepared by the witness while
the information was fresh in his or her mind and requires the witness
to testify that the record was true when made. Since the inspector did
not record the statement and is not present to testify, B is incorrect. A
present sense impression is a statement describing an event that was
made  while  or  soon  after  the  declarant  perceived  the  event.  Since

693

there  is  no  indication  that  the  inspector  perceived  the  event,  D  is
incorrect.

56.  C  Under  FRE  804(b)(2),  a  statement  is  admissible  as  a  dying
declaration in a civil or criminal case if it was made by a person now
unavailable,  about  the  cause  of  his  or  her  death,  upon  personal
knowledge, and under a sense of immediately impending death. Since
the victim is presently unavailable and said that he saw the defendant
shoot  him,  his  statement  is  admissible  if  he  made  it  with  a  sense  of
impending death.

Although the common law made such statements admissible in cases
of criminal homicide only, A is incorrect because the FRE extend the
exception to civil litigation as well. Transactional immunity prevents
criminal  prosecution  but  does  not  prevent  civil  litigation.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  Where  it  exists,  the  effect  of  the  “dead  man's
statute” is to exclude certain evidence, not to make it admissible. D is
therefore incorrect.

57. B Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the
matter  asserted  in  that  statement.  An  admission  is  an  out-of-court
statement made by a party that is offered against that party. Under the
common law, admissions are admissible as exceptions to the hearsay
rule. Under FRE 801(d)(2), admissions are admissible because they
are  not  hearsay.  If  an  employee  of  a  party  makes  a  statement  that  is
offered  against  the  employer,  the  statement  may  be  admissible  as  a
vicarious  admission  of  the  employer  if  it  was  made  while  the
employment  relationship  existed  and  concerned  a  matter  within  the
scope  of  the  declarant's  employment.  If  the  mechanic  was  employed
by the airline as a mechanic, his statement that he failed to inspect the
plane  does  concern  a  matter  within  the  scope  of  his  employment.  It
would  not  be  admissible  as  a  vicarious  admission  of  the  airline,
however,  unless  it  can  be  established  that  the  mechanic  was  so
employed. If the mechanic made an out-of-court statement that he was
so employed, it would be hearsay if offered to prove his employment
by  the  airline.  For  this  reason,  independent  evidence  of  the
employment relationship is required.

A is therefore incorrect. Although the common law requires that the
declarant  be  one  authorized  to  speak  for  the  party,  C  is  incorrect
because  the  FRE  have  abolished  that  requirement.  D  is  incorrect
because the unavailability of a declarant is not in itself sufficient to

694

make his or her out-of-court assertion admissible.

58. B Under FRE 803(3), an assertion of a declarant's then-existing physical

sensation is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Statements  made  as  part  of  a  medical  history  may  be  admissible  if
made  for  purposes  of  diagnosis  or  treatment.  Ordinarily,  “medical
history”  refers  to  statements  made  by  a  declarant  about  physical
sensations and events in the past. A is incorrect for this reason, and
because  the  nurse's  testimony  does  not  indicate  that  the  plaintiff's
complaints were made  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  a  diagnosis  or
treatment.  C  is  incorrect  because  others  than  the  injured  party  may
testify  to  objective  signs  of  pain  or  to  the  injured  party's  statements
about  the  pain  if  they  fit  into  exceptions  to  the  hearsay  rule.  D  is
incorrect because of the present physical sensation exception.

59.  C  Evidence  is  relevant  if  it  tends  to  prove  or  disprove  a  fact  of
consequence.  Relevant  evidence  is  ordinarily  admissible.  Self-
defense  is  a  privilege  to  use  force  that  the  reasonable  person  in  the
defendant's  shoes  would  have  considered  necessary  to  prevent  an
attack  upon  himself  or  herself.  Evidence  of  the  plaintiff's  reputation
for  unprovoked  violence  is  relevant  because  it  tends  to  establish
whether  the  reasonable  person  in  the  defendant's  shoes  would  have
believed himself or herself to be under attack.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  the  evidence  is  relevant  to  the
reasonableness  of  the  defendant's  fear.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
plaintiff's  character  is  not  related  to  the  essential  elements  of  a
battery action.

60.  D  An  expert  may  testify  to  an  opinion  based  upon  material  not  in
evidence  so  long  as  it  is  material  upon  which  the  reasonable  expert
would  have  based  an  opinion,  even  if  the  material  itself  would  be
inadmissible.

A is therefore incorrect. An X-ray is regarded as a writing, and if a
witness is testifying only to its contents, it may be covered by the best
evidence rule. If so, such testimony may be excluded unless it can be
shown that the X-ray itself is not available. In this case, however, the
witness was not testifying solely to the contents of the X-ray, but to an
opinion that she formed based upon examination of the plaintiff's leg,
in  addition  to  study  of  the  X-ray.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is
incorrect because an expert may base his or her opinion testimony on

695

material not in evidence.

61.  D  Evidence  of  the  non-occurrence  of  similar  accidents  might  be
admissible  to  prove  that  the  area  was  not  dangerous,  but  only  if  the
condition during the period testified to was substantially the same at
the  time  of  the  accident.  Since  there  is  no  indication  that  the  stairs
were littered with paper during the period described by the witness,
the  fact  that  no  similar  accidents  occurred  does  not  prove  that  the
condition was not unsafe when the plaintiff fell.

A and B are therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because it is perfectly
permissible and proper for witnesses to give self-serving testimony.
(That they often do is illustrated by the fact that criminal defendants
frequently say, “I didn't do it!”)

62. A If the declarant is unavailable as a witness, a statement made under
the belief of impending death is admissible under an exception to the
hearsay  rule.  While  the  declarant  must  be  aware  of  his  or  her
impending  death,  he  or  she  does  not  have  to  actually  die.  The  only
requirement is that the declarant is unavailable. Here, since the man
has fled and moved beyond the court's subpoena power, the exception
applies. C and D are  therefore  incorrect.  An  excited  utterance  is  an
exception  for  certain  statements  made  under  the  influence  of  a
startling event. Here, the declarant is in bed dying from cancer, which
is  not  a  “startling  event”  (e.g.,  a  car  crash,  shooting,  etc.).  B  is
therefore incorrect.

63. D Since cross-examination about the witness's whereabouts is directly
relevant to impeachment of his direct testimony, his refusal to answer
makes  meaningful  cross-examination  impossible.  When  a  witness
cannot  be  subjected  to  full  cross-examination,  his  direct  testimony
should be stricken.

A is incorrect because the privilege is available whenever testimony
of the witness might lead to criminal prosecution of the witness, even
though the matter in which the testimony is elicited is not a criminal
proceeding.  The  privilege  against  self-incrimination  would  offer
little protection if it was necessary for the person invoking it to show
how  the  statement  might  be  incriminating.  Thus,  unless  it  is
impossible to conceive of circumstances in which the answer called
for would be incriminating, the witness may invoke the privilege. B
is therefore incorrect. C is a fabrication without any basis in law; in

696

any  event,  it  is  patently  incorrect  since  the  issue  is  not  whether  the
witness  should  have  been  allowed  to  invoke  the  privilege  but
whether his direct testimony should have been stricken.

64. B A writing may be admitted under the business record exception to the
hearsay  rule  if  it  was  made  in  the  course  of  a  regularly  conducted
business  activity  from  the  recorder's  own  knowledge  or  from  an
inherently  reliable  source  and  was  accurate  when  made.  If  the
investigation of crimes is not a regularly conducted business activity
for  the  college,  its  record  of  such  an  investigation  would  not  be
admissible as a business record. Although it is not certain that a court
would  come  to  that  conclusion,  the  argument  in  B  is  the  only  one
listed that could possibly support the defendant's objection.

A  is  incorrect  because  a  business  record  may  be  admissible  even
though  the  person  who  made  it  is  available  and  has  testified.  C  is
incorrect because it is an inaccurate statement of law; the exception
applies  in  all  trials.  Hearsay  is  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  to
prove  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  that  statement.  The  phrase
“second-level hearsay” is sometimes used to describe a hearsay that
is  included  in  another  statement  that  is  also  hearsay.  Here,  for
example,  the  defendant's  statement  was  made  out  of  court  and  is
offered to prove that the defendant stabbed the victim (i.e., the matter
asserted). The file that includes the statement is also an out-of-court
statement that is offered to prove the truth of what it asserts (i.e., that
the  defendant  said  he  stabbed  the  victim).  D  is  incorrect,  however,
because the defendant's statement is an admission, which FRE 801(d)
(2)  defines  as  a  statement  made  by  a  party  and  offered  against  that
party, and which that rule specifically provides is not hearsay.

65.  B  Evidence  that  the  witness  never  observed  strange  behavior  in  a
testator  is  admissible  to  prove  he  or  she  was  competent,  but  only  if
the nature of the witness's experience with the testator is such that he
or  she  is  likely  to  have  observed  such  behavior  if  it  occurred.
Semiannual  examinations  of  the  testator  probably  are  not  frequent
enough  to  permit  the  inference  that  behavior  that  did  not  occur  on
those visits did not occur at other times.

A is incorrect since if a witness does have sufficient opportunity to
observe, the testimony will be admitted. C is incorrect since the door
is thus opened only to testimony that is not otherwise inadmissible. D
is incorrect because the doctor is not testifying to his opinion but to

697

his observations.

66.  D  The  FRE  recognize  an  exception  to  the  hearsay  rule  for  business
records.  Some  courts  interpret  the  FRE  in  a  way  that  makes  police
records  inadmissible  under  this  exception  to  the  hearsay  rule.  Other
courts  interpret  the  FRE  in  a  way  that  makes  police  records
admissible under this exception. Under FRE 803(6), a written report
is  admissible  as  a  business  record  if  it  was  made  in  the  regular
course  of  business,  while  the  transaction  recorded  was  fresh  in  the
entrant's  mind,  regarding  facts  within  his  or  her  own  knowledge  or
from  an  inherently  reliable  source.  The  statement  contained  in  the
police record filed by the witness was not based on a fact known by
the  witness  of  his  own  knowledge.  It  might  still  be  admissible,
however, if it had been received from an inherently reliable source.
Although the other officer may be regarded as such a source, he did
not have personal knowledge either. Since the source of the recorded
fact was an unidentified witness, and since an unidentified witness is
not an inherently reliable source, the record is not admissible.

Although  a  testifying  witness  may  refresh  his  or  her  recollection  by
reference to documents that are not in evidence, his or her doing so
does not make those documents admissible. A is therefore incorrect.
B is incorrect for the reason given above. Since the police are in the
business—among  other  things—of  investigating  accidents,  a  police
report  may  be  regarded  as  a  record  kept  in  the  usual  course  of
business and may be admissible as such if all the other requirements
are met. C is therefore incorrect.

67. A Unless it is excluded by some rule of law, evidence is admissible if it
is  relevant  to  a  material  issue.  Since  contracts  are  interpreted  in
accordance with the intentions of the parties, the buyer's intentions are
material to the seller's action for breach of contract. Since the buyer
did  not  understand  the  seller's  statement,  the  brother's  translation  of
that statement would tend to establish (i.e., is relevant to) the buyer's
intentions. It should therefore be admitted.

In  jurisdictions  that  have  a  “dead  man's  statute,”  that  law  may
prohibit  the  admission  of  evidence  regarding  a  transaction  with  a
decedent. B  is  incorrect  because,  although  the  “dead  man's  statute”
may  result  in  the  exclusion  of  evidence,  it  is  never  used  as  a
justification  for  its  admission.  If  the  brother  were  testifying  to  the
meaning of a Dutch word or expression, his testimony would not be

698

admissible unless he qualified as an expert on the Dutch language. C
is incorrect, however, because the brother's testimony is not offered
for the purpose of explaining the meaning of the seller's language but
for  the  purpose  of  showing  what  the  buyer  believed  it  to  mean.
Hearsay  is  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  for  the  purpose  of
proving  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  that  statement.  Since  the
brother's  statement  to  the  buyer  was  made  out  of  court,  it  would  be
hearsay if offered for the purpose of proving the truth of anything that
it asserted. D is incorrect, however, because the statement is offered
not to prove the truth of what was asserted by either the seller or the
brother,  but  to  establish  the  buyer's  state  of  mind  at  the  time  of  the
negotiation. It is therefore not hearsay.

68. D The fact that a witness made prior statements that were inconsistent
with  his  or  her  testimony  indicates  that  he  or  she  may  not  be  a
credible  witness,  or  at  least  that  his  or  her  testimony  may  not  be
worthy  of  belief.  Thus,  for  the  purpose  of  impeachment,  a  witness
may be cross-examined about prior inconsistent statements. Since the
defendant's  statement  to  the  arresting  officers  was  inconsistent  with
his statement on the witness stand, he may be cross-examined about it.

Statements  obtained  in  violation  of  a  prisoner's  Miranda  rights
cannot be used against him or her in a criminal prosecution. Because
use  of  such  statements  for  impeachment  in  a  civil  proceeding  is  not
ordinarily  contemplated  by  the  police,  prohibiting  such  use  is  not
likely to affect police conduct. For this reason, it has been held that
statements  obtained  in  violation  of  a  prisoner's  Miranda  rights  may
be  used  for  purposes  of  impeachment  in  civil  proceedings.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the
defendant's motion was to suppress the use of the physical evidence
rather  than  the  use  of  statements  made  during  the  interrogation,  and
second,  even  an  order  suppressing  the  use  of  his  statements  in  the
criminal  prosecution  would  not  prevent  their  use  in  this  civil
proceeding. If statements are obtained from a prisoner in violation of
his or her constitutional rights, the same policy that prohibits their use
as  evidence  prohibits  the  use  of  leads  obtained  as  a  result  of  those
statements. This is the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine. Although
this doctrine may result in the exclusion of evidence, it is never used
to justify the admission of evidence. C is therefore incorrect.

69. B Under FRE 803(6), a properly authenticated written record qualifies

699

as  an  exception  to  the  hearsay  rule  if  it  was  made  as  part  of  the
regular course of business while the transaction recorded was fresh in
the  entrant's  mind  regarding  facts  within  his  or  her  personal
knowledge  or  from  an  inherently  reliable  source.  This  invoice  was
kept in the regular course of business and has been authenticated by
the  employee.  Although  the  employee  did  not  personally  know  the
contents of the shipment, the shipping clerk's business duty to report
accurately makes him an inherently reliable source, and the employee
made  the  entries  immediately  upon  receiving  the  information  from
him.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  past  recollection  recorded  exception
applies  only  if  the  record  was  prepared  from  the  witness's  own
knowledge, and permits it to be read to the jury, but not admitted into
evidence. The best evidence rule provides that where the contents of
a  writing  are  in  issue,  secondary  evidence  of  the  writing  is
inadmissible  unless  the  original  is  shown  to  be  unavailable.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  effect  of  the  best  evidence  rule  is  to  exclude
certain classes of evidence and not to make admissible evidence that
would  otherwise  be 
inadmissible.  A  witness  whose  present
recollection  has  been  refreshed  by  reference  to  a  document  may
testify from his or her refreshed recollection. D is incorrect because
the employee stated that she had no present recollection and because
the attorney for the plaintiff sought to introduce the document itself.

70.  D  Under  the  UCC,  evidence  of  the  usage  of  trade  terminology  is
admissible to prove the meaning of such terms in a contract between
parties in the trade. Since both the plaintiff and the defendant are in
commercial industry, the witness's evidence of trade usage should be
admissible.

Witnesses  frequently  make  self-serving  statements.  In  fact,  almost
anything  said  by  a  party-witness  is  likely  to  be  self-serving  (e.g.,  a
criminal defendant's testimony that she is “not guilty,” or a personal
injury  plaintiff's  testimony  that  the  defendant  went  through  a  red
light). A  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  rule  of  law  that  excludes
self-serving statements from evidence. Hearsay is defined as an out-
of-court statement offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the
matter asserted in that statement. Since the witness's testimony is not
of  an  out-of-court  statement,  it  cannot  be  hearsay.  B  is  therefore
incorrect.  Although  proof  of  an  established  business  custom  may  be

700

offered as evidence that it was followed on a particular occasion, C
is  incorrect  because  the  witness  has  not  testified  to  any  particular
custom of her company.

71. D Under FRE 412, evidence of specific acts involving the victim's past
sexual behavior is admissible in a rape trial only if it is relevant to an
issue  regarding  the  source  of  semen,  or  if  it  involves  past  sexual
behavior between the victim and the defendant and is offered for the
purpose  of  establishing  the  defense  of  consent.  Since  the  defendant
admits to having sexual intercourse with the victim, there is no issue
regarding the source of semen. Although the defendant has asserted a
defense  of  consent,  the  evidence  offered  by  his  attorney  does  not
relate  to  prior  sexual  contact  between  the  defendant  and  the  victim.
The evidence is thus inadmissible.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

72. A FRE 501 provides that in the trial of a civil proceeding in which state
law  provides  the  rule  of  decision,  the  rules  of  privilege  shall  be
determined  in  accordance  with  state  law.  Thus,  if  a  civil  action  is
being tried in a federal court under the substantive law of a state, the
federal  court  must  apply  the  state  law  of  privilege.  If  the  state  law
recognizes a psychotherapist-patient privilege, the federal court must
recognize it as well. Consequently, C and D are incorrect. If the state
law  does  not  recognize  a  psychotherapist-patient  privilege,  the
federal court may not. B is therefore incorrect.

73.  C  Hearsay  is  an  out-of-court  assertion  offered  for  the  purpose  of
proving the truth of the matter asserted. Since the witness's testimony
referred to the doctor's assertion that the pink pills were for pain and
was offered for the purpose of proving that the plaintiff took them for
pain, that assertion is hearsay.

A  declaration  of  the  declarant's  present  physical  sensation  is
admissible  as  an  exception  to  the  hearsay  rule.  The  plaintiff's
statement, “My neck hurts,” might thus be admissible. A is incorrect,
however,  because  the  doctor's  statement  did  not  declare  anything
about  his  own  physical  state.  B  is  incorrect  for  the  same  reason.
Statements  of  a  declarant's  past  physical  sensation  are  admissible
under  the  medical  history  exception  if  made  to  a  doctor  for  the
purpose of diagnosis and treatment. D is incorrect, however, because
the objection was to testimony regarding a statement by the doctor.

701

74.  C  Under  FRE  801(d)(1)(C),  evidence  of  prior  identification  is  not
hearsay,  if  the  declarant  is  on  the  witness  stand  and  available  for
cross-examination.

A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect for two reasons: First, a party
is  permitted  to  impeach  his  or  her  own  witness,  and  second,  to
impeach  means  to  attack  the  witness's  credibility,  which  the
prosecuting  attorney  has  not  attempted  to  do  to  the  employee.  D  is
incorrect because although a jury may consider the fact that a witness
is  interested  or  disinterested  in  weighing  the  value  of  his  or  her
testimony, the interest of a witness does not affect the admissibility of
his or her testimony.

75. B Under FRE 803(18), so long as the judge believes the passages are
relevant  to  some  issue,  the  engineer  may  read  those  passages,  and
they  will  be  admissible  to  prove  the  assertions  they  make  regarding
proper  building  and  engineering  techniques.  However,  a  “learned
writing,”  such  as  the  book,  may  not  be  admitted  as  an  exhibit.  The
jury may only hear the appropriate portions read to it, and interpreted
for it by the expert on the stand at the time.

A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

76.  D  It  is  the  jury's  job  to  determine  whether  the  evidence  proves  facts
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of law as charged by the court.
Expert  opinion  may  be  admitted  to  assist  the  trier  of  fact  to
understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, but it may not
be  stated  in  a  way  that  would  deprive  the  jury  of  its  power  to
determine facts. Since the jury must decide whether the defendant had
malice aforethought, expert testimony regarding the defendant's mental
capacity would be admissible. The doctor's statement, however, did
not express an opinion regarding the defendant's mental condition but
rather his opinion whether the defendant had malice aforethought.

Although  the  common  law  once  prohibited  expert  testimony  that
“embraced the ultimate issue,” A is incorrect because FRE 704 (and
the  laws  of  many  states)  have  eliminated  this  restriction.  The
opinions of an expert may be based solely on courtroom observations
(or may even be based on assumed facts contained in a hypothetical
question).  The  fact  that  a  testifying  psychiatrist  has  never  spoken  to
the subject or even seen him or her outside a courtroom may reflect
on the weight (i.e., persuasive value) of his or her testimony but not

702

on its admissibility. B and C are therefore incorrect.

77. B Under FRE 804(b)(2), a statement qualifies for the dying declaration
exception  to  the  hearsay  rule  if  it  was  made  by  a  presently
unavailable  person  under  a  sense  of  immediately  impending  death
upon  personal  knowledge  respecting  the  cause  and  circumstances  of
death  and  is  offered  in  a  criminal  homicide  trial  or  a  civil  action.
Since the plaintiff was in court, she is not presently unavailable, and
her statement does not qualify as a dying declaration.

A is incorrect because it is sufficient that the statement concerned a
cause  or  circumstance  of  what  the  plaintiff  believed  was  her
impending  death.  Although  the  common  law  restricted  the  use  of
dying declarations to criminal homicide trials, C is incorrect because
the  FRE  specifically  authorize  their  admission  in  civil  proceedings.
The FRE do not require that the declarant actually be dying to qualify
his  or  her  statement  as  a  dying  declaration,  so  long  as  he  or  she
believed himself or herself to be dying at the time he or she made it.
D is therefore not sufficient reason to prevent the plaintiff's statement
from being admissible as a dying declaration.

78. C In general, evidence is admissible if it is relevant to a material issue.
Since the defendant's negligence is a material issue in a malpractice
action  against  him,  testimony  that  is  relevant  to  the  defendant's
negligence  is  admissible  unless  excluded  under  one  of  the  rules  of
evidence.  The  common  law  attorney-client  privilege  prevents  an
attorney  from  testifying,  over  his  or  her  client's  objection,  to
confidential  communications  by  the  client  that  were  related  to  the
professional  relationship.  The  privilege  does  not  prevent  such
testimony,  however,  in  litigation  relating  to  a  breach  of  duty  arising
from the relationship.

Thus, A is incorrect. B is incorrect for the above reason, and because
even  unnecessary  statements  may  be  privileged  if  they  relate  to  the
purpose  of  the  consultation.  Ordinarily,  the  attorney-client  privilege
survives the relationship, protecting the confidentiality even after the
attorney-client relationship ceases to exist. Thus, D is incorrect.

79. A At common law, a confidential communication made to an attorney by
a  person  seeking  legal  advice  is  generally  privileged.  If  the
communication is made in the presence of a third person, an inference
may  be  drawn  that  the  person  speaking  did  not  intend  for  the

703

communication  to  be  confidential.  However,  if  the  presence  of  the
third  person  was  necessary,  such  an  inference  cannot  be  drawn  and
the communication remains privileged. Since state law provided for
the  designation  of  the  father  as  the  defendant's  legal  guardian  and
required  his  joinder  as  a  defendant  in  an  action  against  her,  his
presence at the consultation with the attorney was necessary so that he
could assure that the defendant's rights were protected.

it 

is 

incorrect  because 

is  over-inclusive;  only 

B 
those
communications  that  the  client  intended  to  be  confidential  are
privileged.  Where  two  or  more  clients  have  consulted  an  attorney
together on a matter of common interest, their communications are not
privileged  if  one  client  seeks  to  offer  them  as  evidence  against  the
other. C is incorrect, however, because unless the father is seeking to
offer  the  attorney's  testimony  against  the  defendant  (or  vice  versa),
the mere fact that the defendant and the father are joint defendants is
not sufficient to destroy the privilege. A confidential communication
made  to  an  attorney  while  seeking  legal  advice  is  privileged  at
common  law,  whether  or  not  the  attorney  actually  gives  advice  or
agrees  to  represent  the  person  who  made  the  communication.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

80. A Judicial notice is a doctrine that permits courts to accept as true facts
or propositions of law without specific evidence. A fact that has been
judicially noticed becomes part of the record and requires no further
proof.  Although  judicial  notice  is  commonly  taken  of  the  statutes  of
the  state  in  which  a  particular  court  is  sitting,  most  jurisdictions  do
not  permit  municipal  ordinances  to  be  judicially  noticed,  requiring
that  their  contents  be  proven  as  facts.  However,  because  this
jurisdiction  permits  a  court  to  take  judicial  notice  of  municipal
ordinances,  the  court  could  judicially  notice  the  section  in  question
and deny the defendant's motion for dismissal.

In  determining  whether  there  has  been  a  violation,  the  trier  of  fact
may consider facts that have been judicially noticed by the court. B is
therefore  incorrect.  Ordinarily,  judicial  notice  is  taken  of  facts  that
are  commonly  known.  This  may  include  the  contents  of  laws,  since
all are presumed to know them. C is incorrect for two reasons: First,
the judge's personal expertise or knowledge of particular facts is not
sufficient to justify his judicially noticing them, and second, judicial
notice may be taken of commonly known or readily verifiable facts,

704

even  though  the  judge  lacks  personal  expertise.  The  contents  of
relevant law must be proven unless they are judicially noticed by the
court.  Since  courts  frequently  refuse  to  take  judicial  notice  of
municipal ordinances, D is over-inclusive and therefore incorrect.

81. C  A  witness  who  testifies  under  a  grant  of  use  immunity  is  protected
against  use  of  that  testimony  in  any  subsequent  criminal  proceeding
against him or her. Since the commissioner was not a defendant in the
prosecution,  use  immunity  did  not  prevent  the  use  of  his  statement.
FRE 613 permits the admission of prior inconsistent statements of a
witness  for  the  purpose  of  intrinsically  or  extrinsically  impeaching
the credibility of that witness. Evidence of the commissioner's prior
statement  is  thus  admissible  for  the  purpose  of  impeachment.  FRE
801  permits  the  use  of  a  witness's  prior  inconsistent  statement  as
substantive evidence if it was given under oath subject to the penalty
of  perjury  at  a  trial,  hearing,  or  other  proceeding.  Since  the
commissioner's  statement  was  made  under  oath  at  a  grand  jury
proceeding, it is admissible as substantive evidence as well.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

82. A  If  a  proper  foundation  is  laid,  evidence  that  a  place  has  been  used
over  a  period  of  time  without  any  accident  is  logically  relevant  to
prove  that  the  place  was  not  dangerous.  The  foundation  for  such
negative evidence requires proof, however, that the place was used a
substantial  number  of  times  under  substantially  similar  conditions.
The  witness's  testimony  that  the  street  was  a  busy  thoroughfare  is
probably sufficient to establish its use a substantial number of times.
Unless,  however,  it  is  established  that  the  street  was  substantially
unchanged,  proof  that  there  were  no  prior  accidents  is  irrelevant  to
the plaintiff's claim that there was a dangerous curve in the road.

B  is  incorrect  because  if  a  proper  foundation  is  laid  for  the
introduction  of  negative  evidence,  there  is  no  requirement  that  the
court issue a special instruction to the jury. The argument in C is one
that  the  plaintiff's  attorney  may  make  to  the  jury  in  an  attempt  to
persuade it not to draw from the witness's testimony an inference that
the  street  is  safe.  C  is  incorrect,  however,  because  if  a  proper
foundation  for  the  evidence  is  laid,  that  argument  goes  to  its  weight
rather  than  to  its  admissibility.  Although  negative  evidence  presents
severe  relevancy  problems,  the  laying  of  a  proper  foundation
resolves  them,  making  such  evidence  admissible.  B  is  therefore

705

incorrect.

83. A Unless otherwise provided by law, all evidence is admissible that has
a  tendency  to  prove  or  disprove  a  fact  of  consequence  (i.e.,  that  is
relevant).  Since  the  hotel  has  denied  ownership  and  control  of  the
alley,  evidence  relevant  to  ownership  or  control  is  therefore
admissible. The testimony of the witness is relevant to ownership or
control since it is unlikely that hotel employees would clean the alley
if  the  hotel  did  not  own  or  control  it.  His  testimony  is  therefore
admissible.

Hotel employees might have begun cleaning the alley even though the
hotel  did  not  own  or  control  it,  and  the  hotel  attorney  may  try  to
convince a jury not to infer ownership or control from the remedial
measure. B is incorrect, however, because the argument that it states
goes  to  the  weight  rather  than  the  admissibility  of  the  evidence.
Although a policy seeks to encourage safety by prohibiting evidence
of subsequent remedial measures for the purpose of proving fault, C
and  D  are  incorrect  because  the  testimony  of  the  witness  is
admissible for the limited purpose of proving ownership or control.

84.  D  Under  FRE  803(3),  an  assertion  of  the  declarant's  then-existing
physical sensation is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.
The common law makes a distinction that prohibits the admission of
such statements if they were made in contemplation of litigation. The
FRE  do  not  make  such  a  distinction,  however,  allowing  the
circumstances  under  which  the  statement  was  made  to  go  to  the
weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Where  it  is  recognized,  the
physician-patient  privilege  may  prevent  the  admission  of  testimony
by  a  doctor  regarding  confidential  communications  with  the  patient
over  objection  by  the  patient.  C  is  incorrect  because  an  objection
based  on  the  privilege  would  not  be  available  to  anyone  but  the
patient.

85.  C  Under  FRE  803(2),  a  statement  relating  to  a  startling  event  made
while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the
event  is  admissible  as  an  excited  utterance.  This  is  so  even  if  the
declarant's identity is unknown.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  term  self-serving  declaration  usually
refers  to  an  out-of-court  statement  made  by  a  party  and  which  is

706

offered by that party to prove an element of his or her case. Like any
other  hearsay,  it  is  inadmissible  unless  it  falls  into  one  of  the
exceptions to the hearsay rule. (For example, a document containing
self-serving declarations might be admissible as a business record.)
Since the victim is not a party to the prosecution, it is probably not
correct  to  call  his  testimony  self-serving.  More  important,  although
self-serving  declarations  made  out-of-court  may  be  excluded  from
evidence  as  hearsay,  there  is  no  rule  prohibiting  self-serving
testimony.  For  these  reasons,  B  is  incorrect.  Although  an  excited
utterance  is  admissible  only  if  made  by  a  declarant  with  personal
knowledge, such knowledge is presumed. D is therefore incorrect.

86. B A witness is permitted to refresh her recollection before testifying by
reviewing  past  notes,  depositions,  and  other  statements.  FRE  612
gives the trial court discretion to require the production at trial of any
writings  that  were  used  to  refresh  a  witness's  recollection  before
trial.

Secondary evidence to prove the contents of a writing is inadmissible
under  the  best  evidence  rule  unless  the  original  or  a  qualified
duplicate  is  shown  to  be  unavailable.  Thus,  if  the  witness  were
testifying  to  the  contents  of  the  notes,  her  testimony  would  be
inadmissible  unless  the  notes  were  shown  to  be  unavailable.  She  is
not  testifying  to  the  contents  of  the  notes,  however,  but  from  her
memory after refreshing it by looking at the notes. For this reason, the
best  evidence  rule  is  inapplicable,  and  A  is  incorrect.  Although  the
notes  have  not  been  offered  into  evidence,  they  have  been  used  to
refresh  the  witness's  recollection  before  trial.  For  this  reason,  the
court  may  require  their  production  under  FRE  612.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.  An  admission  is  a  statement  by  a  party  that  is  offered
against that party. Since the witness is not a party to the proceeding,
her statements cannot be admissions. D is therefore incorrect.

87.  D  Although  the  court  decides  whether  evidence  is  admissible  and
whether a witness is competent to testify, it is for the jury to decide
what weight to give testimony that the court has admitted. In doing so,
the jury must determine how credible it finds a particular witness to
be.  If  that  witness  is  an  expert  testifying  to  his  or  her  opinions,  it
would be impossible for the jury to make that determination without
the
knowing 
defendant's  attorney  is  not  sufficient,  since  it  is  very  likely  that  the

the  witness's  qualifications.  The  concession  by 

707

jury  will  hear  contrary  opinions  given  by  other  experts.  To  decide
which  of  the  experts  it  believes,  the  jury  must  be  able  to  compare
their  qualifications.  For  this  reason,  the  details  of  the  doctor's
qualifications  remain  an  issue  even  though  the  defendant's  attorney
concedes that she is sufficiently qualified to testify to her opinions.

A and B are therefore incorrect. If all parties agree to a fact, a court
may  accept  it  as  true  without  requiring  further  proof.  Thus,  if  all
parties agree that a particular witness qualifies as an expert, the court
may—on the basis of that stipulation—dispense with the requirement
of  further  proof  (although  it  may  not  prevent  the  party  offering  the
testimony of that witness from questioning him or her about his or her
qualifications). C is therefore incorrect.

88. A In general, evidence is admissible if it is relevant to a material issue
(i.e.,  tends  to  establish  some  fact  of  consequence)  in  the  litigation.
Since  liability  for  negligence  does  not  depend  on  whether  the
defendant  was  insured,  the  fact  that  the  defendant  was  or  was  not
insured is not of consequence (i.e., not relevant to a material issue) in
the litigation. It is therefore not admissible.

A  compromise  consists  of  a  payment  or  a  promise  to  pay  given  in
return for a promise to discontinue or not to assert a claim. Since the
defendant  was  not  offering  anything  in  return  for  a  promise  not  to
assert  a  claim,  his  statement  was  not  a  compromise  offer.  B  is
therefore incorrect. Admissions are words or acts of a party offered
against that party. Under the common law, admissions of a party may
be  admissible  as  exceptions  to  the  hearsay  rule;  under  FRE  801(d)
(2),  admissions  of  a  party  are  not  hearsay  at  all.  Like  all  other
evidence, however, admissions may be admitted only if relevant to a
material  issue.  Since  the  fact  that  the  defendant  was  or  was  not
insured is not material, his statement—even if it could be regarded as
an  admission—is  inadmissible.  (Note:  It  might  be  argued  that  the
defendant's statement implies that he knew himself to be at fault. This
argument would not make the statement admissible, however, because
FRE 411 specifically provides that evidence that a party was insured
is not admissible for the purpose of establishing that party's fault or
liability.)  FRE  803(2)  provides  that  an  excited  utterance  may  be
admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule and defines an excited
utterance as a statement relating to a startling event or condition that
is made while the declarant is under stress or excitement caused by

708

that  event  or  condition.  D  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the
defendant's statement that he had plenty of insurance is not related to
the accident that produced his excitement, and second, like any other
evidence, an excited utterance is not admissible unless it is relevant
to a material issue.

89. A The credibility of a witness may be impeached extrinsically (i.e., by
evidence  that  does  not  come  from  the  witness's  own  mouth)  by
evidence that tends to show that his or her testimony is not worthy of
belief  because  he  or  she  was  incapable  of  perceiving  accurately.
Since the witness stated that his identification of the defendant was by
the light of the full moon, evidence that there was no moon that night
would  tend  to  show  that  the  witness's  identification  is  unworthy  of
belief because he was incapable of making accurate observations.

The phrase res gestae was formerly used to refer to statements made
under stress resulting from a startling event. Its use has largely been
replaced  by  the  “excited  utterance”  concept.  B  is  incorrect  because
the testimony of the expert did not refer to any statement made while
under  stress  or  excitement.  Except  for  evidence  of  prior  statements,
the  FRE  do  not  require  confrontation  as  a  foundation  for  the
introduction of extrinsic evidence offered to impeach a witness. C is
therefore incorrect. A matter is described as “collateral” if it is not
material to issues in a case. D is incorrect because a witness's ability
to perceive or remember is always regarded as material.

90. A Although evidence of unconvicted bad acts is generally inadmissible
to extrinsically impeach a witness, FRE 404 provides that it may be
admissible for other purposes. One of the most common permissible
uses  of  such  evidence  is  to  create  an  inference  that  the  defendant  is
guilty  of  the  crime  charged  by  showing  that  it  was  part  of  a  general
criminal  plan  or  scheme.  Since  the  defendant's  possession  of  41
different  credit  cards  bearing  36  different  names  suggests  that  she
planned to make fraudulent use of them all, evidence of that fact may
be  admissible.  Such  circumstantial  evidence  must  be  subjected  to
close  examination  to  determine  whether  its  probative  value  is
outweighed  by  its  prejudicial  effect,  so  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court
would admit the evidence. Of all the arguments set forth, however, A
is  the  only  one  that  could  possibly  provide  the  prosecutor  with  an
effective argument in opposition to the motion to exclude.

Since  the  defendant  is  not  charged  with  stealing  credit  cards,  an

709

inference that she did so is not relevant to any fact of consequence in
the  prosecution.  For  this  reason,  B  is  incorrect.  (Note:  It  might  be
logical  to  argue  that  such  an  inference  is  relevant  because  a  person
who  would  steal  credit  cards  is  probably  disposed  to  make
fraudulent  use  of  them.  Such  an  argument  would  fail,  however,
because evidence of unconvicted acts is inadmissible for the purpose
of proving a mere criminal disposition.)

Under  the  Fifth  Amendment  privilege  against  self-incrimination,  a
criminal defendant cannot be required to explain his or her conduct.
C  is  therefore  incorrect.  An  admission  by  conduct  occurs  when  a
party engages in conduct that indicates his or her own belief that he or
she  is  guilty  of  the  crime  charged  (e.g.,  attempting  to  bribe  an
arresting officer to let the defendant go free or attempting to flee after
being charged with a crime). Since possession of credit cards bearing
other  names  does  not  indicate  that  the  defendant  believed  herself  to
be  guilty  of  fraudulently  using  the  card  bearing  the  name  “Timothy
Nolan,” it is not an admission by conduct. D is therefore incorrect.

91.  C  The  fact  that  a  witness  has  previously  made  a  statement  that  is
inconsistent  with  his  or  her  testimony  indicates  that  he  or  she  is  not
always honest and that, therefore, his or her testimony is not worthy of
belief. For this reason, a witness may be cross-examined about prior
inconsistent  statements.  Although  the  common  law  requires  that  the
witness first be told when and to whom the statement was made, the
FRE have dispensed with this requirement.

For  the  above  reason,  A  and  D  are  incorrect.  Under  some
circumstances, former testimony given under oath may be admissible
as  substantive  evidence,  but  prior  inconsistent  statements  are
admissible for purposes of impeachment even if not made under oath.
B is therefore incorrect.

92. B In general, evidence is admissible only if it is relevant to a material
issue. Evidence is relevant to a material issue if it tends to establish
some  fact  of  consequence.  Since  the  defendant  is  charged  with
knowingly  possessing  the  marijuana  found  in  the  trunk,  the  only
material  issue  is  whether  the  defendant  knew  it  was  there.  The  note
from  his  wife  may  indicate  that  they  smoked  marijuana  together  on
some other occasion (although her use of the word “stuff” makes even
this questionable), but it does not tend to establish anything about the
defendant's knowledge of what was in the trunk of the borrowed car.

710

For  that  reason,  it  is  not  relevant  to  a  material  issue  and  should  be
excluded.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the
matter  asserted  in  that  statement.  There  is  some  doubt  about  the
reason for offering the note from the defendant's wife. If it is offered
for  any  reason  other  than  to  prove  that  they  “got  high  on  the  stuff
[they]  smoked  last  night,”  it  is  not  hearsay.  Even  if  it  is  offered  for
that  purpose,  however,  it  probably  falls  under  an  exception  to  the
hearsay rule since it is a declaration against the penal interests of the
defendant's wife. Although declarations against the penal interest are
not  exceptions  to  the  hearsay  rule  at  common  law  (which  makes  an
exception  only  for  declarations  against  financial  interest),  they  are
exceptions under FRE 804(b)(3). 
A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Under  the  common  law  spousal  privilege,
one spouse may not give evidence against another in a criminal case.
Thus,  if  the  jurisdiction  recognizes  the  common  law  spousal
privilege, it would probably result in the exclusion of the note from
the  defendant's  wife.  C  is  incorrect,  however,  because  its  language
indicates  that  this  would  be  the  only  reason  for  excluding  the  note,
and,  as  explained  above,  the  note  would  be  excluded  even  if  the
jurisdiction  did  not  recognize  this  privilege.  Although  the  statement
contained  in  the  note  from  the  defendant's  wife  is  a  declaration
against her interest and therefore an exception to the hearsay rule, it is
not  admissible  because,  as  explained  above,  it  is  not  relevant  to  a
material issue. D is therefore incorrect.

93. A  Most  jurisdictions  hold  that  cross-examination  should  be  limited  to
inquiry  into  matters  to  which  the  witness  testified  on  direct
examination.  Some  jurisdictions  grant  broader  latitude.  All  agree,
however,  that  questions  that  go  beyond  the  scope  of  cross-
examination  are  improper.  Thus,  if  the  question  went  beyond  the
scope of cross-examination, the objection should be sustained.

B  is  incorrect  because  leading  questions  are  permitted  on  cross-
examination. A hostile witness is one who has demonstrated anger or
hostility to the attorney questioning him or her. C is incorrect because
there is no indication that the plaintiff has done so. Since the question
is  not  whether  the  dog  is  gentle,  but  whether  the  dog  is  generally
known  to  be  gentle,  the  plaintiff's  expertise  (or  lack  of  it)  on  the
subject of dog behavior is irrelevant. D is therefore incorrect.

711

94. A Ordinarily, a will must be authenticated by witnesses who testify to
its  execution.  A  is  therefore  correct.  FRE  902  provides  that
periodicals,  publications  issued  by  public  authorities,  and  certified
copies  of  public  records  are  self-authenticating.  B,  C,  and  D  are
therefore incorrect.

95. B If a proper foundation is laid, evidence that a particular product has
been  used  many 
is  admissible  as
times  without  accident 
circumstantial  evidence  that  its  condition  is  not  dangerous.  The
required foundation includes evidence that the conditions under which
the product was used were identical to those that existed at the time of
the accident and that the witness would have heard if there had been
any accidents. Since the witness testified that more than 10,000 of the
motorcycles  were  sold,  since  presumably  they  were  used  on  roads,
and since most of these roads have bumps, the requirement of use in
identical  conditions  has  probably  been  satisfied.  To  complete  the
required foundation, it is thus necessary only to show that the witness
was the person to whom all complaints of product failure would have
been made.

A is incorrect because although a judge may choose to give a special
instruction regarding the uncertainty of negative evidence, there is no
rule of law requiring such an instruction. C is incorrect because the
objection that it raises goes to the weight rather than the admissibility
of  the  evidence.  D  is  incorrect  because  under  conditions  such  as
those described above, negative evidence is admissible.

96.  A  Evidence  that  tends  to  impeach  a  witness's  credibility  by  showing
bias  is  admissible.  The  facts  that  the  witness  and  the  plaintiff  were
political  rivals,  and  that  the  witness  had  used  smear  tactics  in
campaigning against the plaintiff in the past, would tend to show bias
and are therefore likely to be admitted.

B is incorrect because the fact that the magazine brought the plaintiff's
reputation into issue is not in itself sufficient to require the admission
of  evidence  of  a  type  that  would  otherwise  be  inadmissible.  An
admission is a statement by a party that is offered against that party.
Since  the  official  is  not  a  party,  nothing  said  by  him  could  be
regarded  as  an  admission.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect,
since the evidence was admissible to show bias.

97.  C  Under  FRE  803(4),  statements  purporting  to  describe  the  way  in

712

which  a  physical  condition  came  about  are  admissible  as  part  of  a
medical history if made for the purpose of diagnosis, and if pertinent
to diagnosis. The term diagnosis refers to the nature and origin of an
injury. Even though the doctor's examination was performed to enable
her to testify, she was attempting to form a diagnosis. Since the sound
made by the plaintiff's elbow striking the pavement might be pertinent
to a determination of the nature and origin of the plaintiff's injury (i.e.,
a diagnosis), the statement is admissible.

A is incorrect because a statement made as part of a medical history
is  admissible  as  an  exception  to  the  hearsay  rule.  B  is  incorrect
because even though the examination was performed in contemplation
of the doctor's testimony, one of its purposes was to allow the doctor
to  diagnose  (i.e.,  determine  the  nature  of)  the  plaintiff's  injury.
Although  a  witness  might  be  permitted  to  testify  to  his  or  her  own
former sense impression, there is no exception to the hearsay rule for
a witness's repetition of a declarant's former sense impression. D is
therefore incorrect.

98.  D  The  records  are  relevant  to  the  issues  since  they  would  tend  to
establish  what  knowledge  the  company  had  regarding  the  effects  of
the car's design. They are not privileged for the following reasons:

They are not an attorney's work product because they do not contain
mental  impressions  formed  by  an  attorney.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.
They are not materials prepared for litigation since they were made
before  the  car  was  even  marketed.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  They
were  not  prepared  for  the  purpose  of  communicating  with  the
company's attorney, so C is incorrect.

99. C An expert may testify in answer to a hypothetical question so long as
the facts assumed in that hypothetical have been established (or will
be  established)  by  the  evidence  offered.  Since  the  plaintiff's  case
involves  the  assertion  that  her  fall  down  the  stairs  resulted  in  her
injury, it was proper for the school's attorney to ask for the doctor's
opinion as to whether such an injury was possible given such facts.

The  expert's  answer  may  be  based  on  the  facts  assumed  in  the
hypothetical  and  need  not  be  based  on  facts  actually  in  evidence  or
known  by  him  or  her.  A and B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Although  an
expert's  opinion  may  be  based  on  observations  made  in  the
courtroom, D is incorrect because the doctor's was not.

713

100. A The statement of the eyewitness fits the classic definition of hearsay:
an  out-of-court  statement  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  matter
asserted in that statement.

Exceptions  to  the  hearsay  rule  are  made  for  past  recollection
recorded  and  business  records,  but  only  if  the  person  recording  the
information knew it to be true of his or her own knowledge when the
record was made. Since the officer could not have known of his own
knowledge whether the statement of the eyewitness was true, B and D
are  incorrect.  Res  gestae  is  sometimes  used  as  a  synonym  for
“excited  utterance,”  but  C  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  that  the
statement resulted from an interview would probably prevent it from
being an excited utterance and because there is no indication that the
witness made the statement under stress.

101. C Under both FRE 803(7) and the majority rule, if a business record is
otherwise  admissible,  the  absence  of  entries  in  it  may  be  used  to
establish non-occurrence of a particular event if it was the practice of
the business to promptly record all such events.

A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect because the fact that evidence
is  self-serving  is  not  in  itself  sufficient  to  make  it  inadmissible.
Although almost anything may be used by a witness to refresh his or
her recollection, the fact that a document was so used is not sufficient
to permit its admission into evidence. D is therefore incorrect.

102. D Laypersons may testify to their sense impressions in terms of opinion
when  there  is  no  other  practical  way  to  describe  these  sense
impressions.  The  only  possible  way  of  describing  the  smell  of
alcohol  is  to  say  that  it  smells  like  alcohol,  and  testimony  so
describing it is admissible.

A leading question is one that would cause the reasonable person to
believe  that  the  questioner  was  seeking  one  specific  answer  rather
than another. A is incorrect because the question did not indicate what
answer  it  sought.  B  is  incorrect  because  under  the  circumstances,  a
conclusion  was  the  only  possible  way  of  describing  the  officer's
sense  impression.  Although  it  was  once  held  that  opinion  testimony
was  not  admissible  if  it  went  to  an  ultimate  issue  in  the  case,  the
prohibition  has  been  abandoned  under  the  FRE  and  in  a  majority  of
common law jurisdictions. C is therefore incorrect.

103. D  In  interpreting  terms  in  a  contract,  courts  attempt  to  determine  what

714

the  parties  had  in  mind  when  they  agreed  to  those  terms.  Since
evidence  of  prior  transactions  between  the  same  parties  may  be
relevant  indications  of  what  they  were  thinking  or  expecting  when
they  formed  the  agreement,  such  evidence  is  ordinarily  admissible.
However, evidence of transactions that did not involve the defendant
would not give any indication of the defendant's state of mind unless
the defendant was aware of those transactions. Since the facts do not
show that the defendant was aware of the transactions in question, D
is correct.

A is incorrect because such evidence is admissible only if it involved
the same parties. B is incorrect because the witness's statement is not
directly relevant to any statement made by the store manager. Even if
the  20  customers  were  of  the  same  general  size  and  class  as  the
defendant,  evidence  of  their  responses  does  not  tend  to  establish
anything at all about the defendant's intentions or expectations at the
time the contract was formed. C is therefore incorrect.

104. C Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the
matter asserted in that statement. If the plaintiff's statement is offered
to  impeach  the  plaintiff  by  showing  that  he  is  not  worthy  of  belief
because he tells different stories on different days, it is not hearsay.
His  statement  is  therefore  admissible  for  impeachment.  At  common
law,  a  statement  of  a  party  offered  against  that  party  (i.e.,  an
admission)  is  hearsay  but  is  admissible  under  an  exception  to  the
hearsay  rule.  Under  FRE  801(d)(2),  an  admission  is  not  hearsay  at
all.  Either  way,  the  plaintiff's  statement  would  be  admissible  as
substantive  evidence.  C  is  therefore  correct,  and  A,  B,  and  D  are
incorrect.

105.  B  Proof  that  a  witness  was  convicted  of  a  felony  or  a  misdemeanor
involving  dishonesty  may  be  admissible  for 
the  purpose  of
extrinsically  impeaching  the  credibility  of  the  witness,  but  not  if  the
conviction was subsequently reversed for any reason.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  evidence  is  offered  to  impeach  the
manager's  credibility  as  a  witness,  and  this  is  not  related  to  his
employment  by  the  seller.  The  fact  that  the  conviction  was  for  a
misdemeanor  would  not  prevent  its  admission  if  the  misdemeanor
was  one  that  involved  dishonesty.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  if  the  crime  of  which  the  witness  was  convicted
was a felony, it may be admissible without regard to the nature of the

715

felony.

106.  D  A  plaintiff  in  a  negligence  action  is  not  required  to  prove  that  the
defendant  or  its  employee  acted  recklessly  or  committed  any  crime.
The employee's acquittal on the criminal charge or reckless driving is
therefore irrelevant to the issues in the plaintiff's action.

Thus,  even  though  a  court  record  might  be  admissible  as  an  official
written statement, A is incorrect because this record is not relevant. B
is incorrect for two reasons: First, the fact that the employee was not
driving recklessly is not relevant to the plaintiff's claim, and second,
since the burden of proof in a criminal case differs from the burden of
proof in a civil case, acquittal in the criminal court cannot determine
the  issues  in  a  civil  case.  If  a  court  record  were  covered  under  an
exception  to  the  hearsay  rule,  the  unavailability  of  the  person  who
was  the  subject  of  the  proceeding  from  which  the  record  emanated
would not prevent its admission. C is therefore incorrect.

107.  D  A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons.  First,  a  confidential  marital
communication  is  one  that  takes  place  during  the  course  of  the
marriage,  and  the  couple  was  not  married  at  the  time  of  the  party.
Second, the privilege protects only confidential communications, and
the  driver's  consumption  of  alcohol  at  the  party  would  not  be
determined to be a confidential communication. Although the common
law  spousal  privilege  might  prevent  adverse  testimony  by  a  party's
spouse even though it concerns events that preceded the marriage, B
is incorrect because the privilege does not survive the marriage and
would have terminated with the couple's divorce. C is a fabrication,
with no basis in law. D is therefore correct.

108. A Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the
truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  that  statement.  The  statement  of  the
firearms  instructor  is  relevant  to  establish  what  the  defendant
believed,  since  the  defendant  was  present  when  he  said  it  and  it  is
likely that he believed what his instructor said. If offered to prove the
defendant's  state  of  mind  rather  than  the  range  of  the  rifle,  it  is  not
hearsay  because  it  is  not  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  what  was
asserted (i.e., that the rifle is accurate at two miles).

On the other hand, if offered to prove the range of the rifle (i.e., the
matter asserted in the statement), it would be inadmissible as hearsay.
B and C are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because the statement

716

is not hearsay if used to prove the defendant's state of mind.

109.  C  Any  witness  who  is  familiar  with  an  alleged  speaker's  voice  may
authenticate  a  recording  of  that  speaker's  voice.  Since  the  witness
spoke  with  the  defendant  while  they  shared  the  cell,  he  is  now
familiar with the defendant's voice and can properly authenticate it.

A is incorrect because hearsay is defined as an out-of-court assertion
offered  for  the  purpose  of  proving  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted.
Here,  the  witness  is  offering  his  opinion  regarding  whether  the
speaker on the audio file is the defendant. Importantly, he is not saying
anything  regarding  any  of  the  defendant's  particular  statements.  B  is
incorrect because there is no special prohibition or rule that takes into
account when the witness became familiar with the alleged speaker's
voice.  Therefore,  it  doesn't  matter  that  the  witness  only  became
familiar  with  the  defendant's  voice  after  arrest.  Under  FRE  702,
expert testimony is only appropriate when the subject matter requires
scientific,  technical,  or  other  specialized  knowledge.  The  witness's
identification  of  the  voice  does  not  require  any  of  these  things.
Therefore, D is incorrect.

110. C Any person who recognizes a voice because of experience that he or
she has had with that voice may testify as to the identification of the
speaker. Since the witness had experience with the defendant's voice
in a face-to-face conversation and claims to recognize it as a result,
her testimony identifying the defendant as the speaker is admissible.

A is incorrect because the extent of the experience that a witness had
with  the  voice  he  or  she  is  identifying  goes  to  the  weight  of  the
evidence  rather  than  to  its  admissibility.  B  is  incorrect  because
everyday experience with speech places the identification of a voice
within the capacity of a layperson who has experience with the voice
sufficient  to  recognize  it.  Although  a  witness  may  testify  to  a
distinctive characteristic that helped him or her to recognize a voice,
D is incorrect because he or she is not required to do so.

111. D A lay witness may be permitted to testify to opinions if those opinions
are rationally based on the personal perceptions of the witness. This
requires, of course, that the witness have an adequate opportunity to
perceive that on which his or her opinion is based. Since the witness
did  not  see  the  defendant's  car  before  the  accident,  and  since  tires
may  screech  even  when  vehicles  are  being  operated  at  reasonable

717

speeds, the witness's opinion as to the speed of the defendant's car is
probably  not  based  on  sufficient  opportunity  to  perceive  and  should
be excluded.

A and B are therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because if he or she
had  sufficient  opportunity  to  perceive  and  form  an  opinion,  a
layperson is competent to form and testify to some opinions.

112. D Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court assertion offered for the purpose
of proving the truth of the matter asserted. Since there appears to be
no reason for offering the statement of the unidentified witness except
to prove the truth of the matter that it asserts, it is hearsay. A business
record may be admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule only if
it was made by one who had personal knowledge of the information
recorded or received it from an inherently reliable source. Since the
investigator  did  not  have  personal  knowledge  and  there  is  no
indication  that  the  witness  interviewed  by  the  deceased  investigator
was an inherently reliable source, A is incorrect. An official written
statement may be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule only as
to information that the public official who recorded it knew of his or
her  own  knowledge.  Since  the  quote  from  the  unidentified  witness
concerns  information  that  the  investigator  did  not  know  of  his  own
knowledge,  B  is  incorrect.  Past  recollection  recorded  is  also
admissible  only  if  the  record  was  made  from  the  recorder's  own
knowledge and if the recorder is present in court to authenticate it. C
is incorrect for these reasons, and because even if it were admissible,
past recollection recorded can be read to the jury but not physically
introduced into evidence.

113.  C  FRE  803(4)  and  (6)  permit  the  introduction  of  hospital  records
containing statements made by the patient for purposes of diagnosis.
Since  the  circumstances  that  led  to  the  injury  are  relevant  to  a
diagnosis of the injury, they may be included in the record offered in
evidence.

A and B are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect since the statements in
the record were not opinion and therefore do not require the testimony
of experts.

114.  A  Character  evidence  is  not  ordinarily  admissible  for  the  purpose  of
proving a person's conduct on a particular occasion. Thus, if evidence
of  the  defendant's  character  is  offered  to  prove  anything  about  his

718

conduct  on  the  occasion  of  the  incident  in  question,  it  is  not
admissible.

B is incorrect because a witness who testifies to a person's reputation
is not required to know that person or to have any personal opinion
about  him.  C  is  applicable  only  in  criminal  prosecutions.  If  the
evidence  were  allowed  for  the  purpose  stated  in  D,  it  would  be  to
prove  that  the  defendant  did  not  strike  the  plaintiff  without
justification. D is therefore incorrect for the same reasons that make
A correct.

115.  A  Under  FRE  803(2),  a  statement  is  admissible  under  the  excited
utterance exception to the hearsay rule if it was about a startling event
and  made  while  under  the  stress  of  excitement  resulting  from  that
event. The FRE further provide that the statement may be admissible
even if the identity of the declarant is unknown.

B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  an  excited
utterance is admissible as a hearsay exception.

116.  B  Physical  illustrations  of  a  witness's  testimony  are  admissible  to
illustrate  that  testimony  if  the  witness  testifies  from  personal
knowledge  that  the  illustration  is  a  fair  representation  of  what  it
purports  to  be.  Since  the  witness  testified  from  her  own  knowledge
that the chart was an accurate representation of the dates on which her
company had done business with the defendant, it may be admitted for
that purpose.

FRE  803(6)  permits  the  admission  of  business  records  if  they  were
kept in the regular course of business and made while the transaction
recorded  was  fresh  in  the  entrant's  mind  regarding  facts  within  her
personal  knowledge  or  from  an  inherently  reliable  source.  This
exception  to  the  hearsay  rule  applies  only  to  the  record  itself,
however, and not to any summary of it. A is therefore incorrect. Under
the  best  evidence  rule,  secondary  evidence  of  a  writing  is  not
admissible to prove the terms of the writing unless the original or a
qualified duplicate is shown to be unavailable. However, this rule is
applicable only when the terms of the writing are in dispute. Since the
contents  of  the  plaintiff's  files  are  not  in  dispute,  the  best  evidence
rule is inapplicable. Introduction of the chart might be said to place
the  contents  of  the  chart  in  issue.  Since  the  chart  is  an  original,
however, the best evidence rule does not exclude it. C is incorrect for

719

these  reasons.  Materials  used  by  a  witness  to  refresh  his  or  her
recollection while he or she is testifying must be shown to opposing
counsel and marked for identification. The court may also require the
production  of  materials  that  were  used  to  refresh  a  witness'
recollection before trial. D is incorrect, however, because FRE 612
leaves this requirement to the court's discretion.

117. C Unless excluded by a rule of law, all evidence is admissible that tends
to  prove  or  disprove  a  fact  in  issue.  The  robber's  identification  is
obviously  a  fact  in  issue.  Since  the  guard's  testimony  tends  to
establish  that  at  the  time  of  his  arrest,  the  defendant's  physical
appearance  fit  the  description  of  the  robber  given  by  witnesses,  her
testimony  is  admissible  for  the  purpose  of  explaining  why  the
defendant no longer has bushy red hair.

A  rule  of  evidence  prohibits  impeachment  of  a  witness  by  extrinsic
evidence of a collateral matter. A is incorrect, however, because the
guard's  testimony  is  not  offered  for  the  purpose  of  impeaching  the
defendant  and  because  the  identity  of  the  robber  is  not  a  collateral
matter.  The  Fifth  Amendment  privilege  against  self-incrimination
protects  a  person  from  being  compelled  to  give  evidence  that  might
be used against him or her in a criminal proceeding. B  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  privilege  relates  only  to  testimonial  evidence
and  does  not  prevent  another  from  testifying  to  what  he  or  she  has
seen  the  defendant  do.  An  admission  by  conduct  occurs  when  a
defendant  does  some  act  that  logically  indicates  that  he  or  she
believes  himself  or  herself  to  be  guilty.  Although  the  defendant's
attempt to change his appearance might suggest such a conclusion, the
fact that there are many other legitimate reasons for the defendant to
shave his head makes this a weak argument in this case. D is therefore
incorrect.

118. A Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the
matter  asserted  in  that  statement.  If  the  former  president's  statement
was offered to prove that the president was permitted to raise his own
salary  (i.e.,  the  matter  asserted),  it  would  be  hearsay.  Since  the
defendant's defense is that he believed the union rules permitted him
to act as he did, evidence of his state of mind is material. Since what
he heard from the former president is likely to have affected his state
of mind, the former president's testimony is relevant to the defendant's
state  of  mind.  Thus,  it  is  not  hearsay  if  offered  to  prove  what  the

720

defendant  thought,  rather  than  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  former
president's statement (i.e., that the defendant was entitled to raise his
own salary).

B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because the former president
is not telling the jury his opinion but rather testifying that he stated that
opinion  in  a  conversation  that  he  had  with  the  defendant.  This  is
offered not to prove that his opinion was correct but to establish the
defendant's state of mind as a result of hearing the former president's
opinion.  An  out-of-court  statement  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  the
matter asserted in that statement is inadmissible as hearsay even if the
person who made that statement testifies to it himself or herself. D is
therefore incorrect.

119. A  Under  FRE  803(2),  an  excited  utterance  is  a  statement  relating  to  a
startling  event  made  while  the  declarant  was  under  the  stress  of
excitement caused by that event, and it is admissible as an exception
to the hearsay rule.

B is therefore incorrect. Statements of a declarant's then-existing state
of  mind  also  fall  under  FRE  803(3)'s  hearsay  exception  for
descriptions of the declarant's intention, attitude, emotional condition,
or  mental  feeling.  C  is  incorrect,  however,  because  although  “I'm
dying” might qualify as a declaration of the plaintiff's state of mind, “I
had the green light in my favor” does not, since it does not describe
her mental state. D is incorrect for two reasons: First, the plaintiff's
statement  said  nothing  about  her  past  mental  state,  and  second,  FRE
803(3) permits declarations of past state of mind to be admitted only
in certain will cases.

120.  C  Although  evidence  of  unconvicted  bad  acts  is  inadmissible  for  the
purpose  of  proving  bad  character,  if  relevant,  it  may  be  admissible
for the purpose of attacking a witness's credibility by showing bias.
An  acquittal  of  the  defendant  would  affect  the  prosecution  of  the
witness  on  the  charge  of  being  his  accessory.  Thus,  the  pending
prosecution  against  the  witness  is  relevant  evidence  of  bias  and  is
admissible for impeachment purposes.

A is therefore incorrect. The bias of a witness is always material to
his  or  her  credibility.  For  this  reason,  evidence  of  such  bias  is
admissible even though it may relate to a matter that is not material to
the  charge  against  the  person  on  trial.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is

721

incorrect because although it may be used to establish bias, extrinsic
evidence of unconvicted bad acts is not admissible for the purpose of
proving that a witness has a bad or dishonest character.

121. D For a witness to be competent, he or she must simply have personal
knowledge of the matter and be willing and able to testify truthfully.
Here,  the  plaintiff  saw  the  television  broadcast,  and  nothing  in  the
question implies he would be unable to tell the truth.

A is incorrect because the fact a recording of the show likely exists
would  not  preclude  the  plaintiff's  oral  testimony  regarding  the
defendant's  defamatory  statements.  B  is  incorrect  because  the
defendant's  statement  is  not  an  out-of-court  statement  being  used  to
prove  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted.  Even  if  the  defamatory
statement itself is untrue, it is still legally actionable simply because
it  was  made.  C  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  the
defendant  is  unavailable  to  testify,  which  is  required  under  the  rule
regarding declarations against interest.

122.  C  To  get  the  whole  story,  a  direct  examiner  or  cross-examiner  may
attempt  to  refresh  a  witness's  present  recollection  by  showing  the
witness's physical objects or writings. If the purpose is to refresh the
witness's recollection (rather than to expose the item to the jury), any
item may be used, so long as it is first shown to opposing counsel and
marked as an exhibit (i.e., for identification). Before refreshing items
can  be  used,  however,  the  witness  must  have  exhausted  his  or  her
unrefreshed  memory.  Since  the  witness  stated  that  he  could  not
remember  whether  he  shouted  (i.e.,  that  his  present  memory  was
exhausted),  the  prosecutor  was  permitted  to  attempt  to  refresh  his
recollection in the manner described.

Since  the  report  was  used  only  to  refresh  the  witness's  recollection
but  was  not  itself  being  used  to  prove  anything,  it  need  not  be
admitted,  admissible,  or  offered  into  evidence.  A,  B,  and  D  are
therefore incorrect.

123.  C  In  some  jurisdictions,  a  learned  treatise  can  be  used  on  the  cross-
examination of an expert witness only if the witness relied upon that
treatise  in  forming  his  or  her  opinion.  FRE  803(18)  dispenses  with
that  requirement,  however,  making  the  contents  of  a  learned  treatise
an exception to the hearsay rule to the extent that they are called to the
attention of a witness during cross-examination. This provision makes
portions  of  learned  treatises  on  medicine  admissible  both  for

722

impeachment and as substantive evidence. (Note: Such portions may
be  read  aloud,  but  a  copy  may  not  be  physically  admitted  into
evidence.)

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  they  are  under-inclusive.  D  is
incorrect  because  the  above  section  makes  the  contents  of  a  learned
treatise an exception to the hearsay rule.

124.  B  Under  FRE  409,  offers  to  pay  or  actual  payments  of  medical  or
the  purposes  of  proving
inadmissible  for 
hospital  bills  are 
negligence,  liability,  or  the  value  of  a  claim.  Although  there  are
purposes  for  which  such  evidence  might  be  admissible,  none  are
listed among the options.

A  is  incorrect  because  FRE  409  excludes  evidence  of  payment  of
hospital  bills  whether  or  not  such  payments  are  part  of  an  offer  of
compromise. C is incorrect for this reason, and because a statement
that is otherwise admissible may remain admissible even though it is
inseparable from a statement about insurance. D is incorrect because
FRE  409  specifically  excludes  such  evidence  if  it  is  offered  for  the
purpose of establishing fault.

125. C  It  is  generally  understood  that  a  lay  witness  may  testify  to  opinions
regarding matters within the contemplation of the ordinary person so
long  as  the  opinion  is  rationally  based  on  the  witness's  personal
perception.  For  an  opinion  to  be  rationally  based  on  the  witness's
personal perception, however, it is necessary to show that the witness
had  sufficient  opportunity  to  perceive  the  matter  about  which  he  or
she  formed  an  opinion.  Since  the  witness  testified  that  she  first  saw
the defendant's car just before it struck the plaintiff, her opportunity to
perceive was probably not adequate to support her opinion. While it
is not certain that a court would sustain the objection, the argument in
C is the only one listed that could possibly support the objection.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  ordinary  driver  is  competent  to  form  an
opinion  regarding  the  speed  of  a  moving  vehicle.  FRE  704
specifically  provides  that  if  opinion  testimony  is  otherwise  not
objectionable,  it  is  not  objectionable  simply  because  it  concerns  an
ultimate  issue  to  be  determined  by  the  trier  of  fact.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. It is sometimes said that witnesses must testify to facts, and
inferences are to be drawn by the jury. For this reason, lay opinions
are usually not admissible if it would be reasonably practical for the

723

witness to state the separate facts that caused him or her to form that
opinion  so  that  the  jury  could  draw  whatever  inferences  it  deems
proper. On the other hand, if it is not reasonably practical to express
the  separate  factors  that  caused  the  witness  to  form  a  particular
opinion, the witness may be permitted to state the opinion that he or
she  formed.  Since  the  factors  that  go  into  an  opinion  regarding  the
speed of a moving vehicle cannot ordinarily be expressed as separate
facts, a witness who is competent to form an opinion as to that speed
will be permitted to express that opinion. D is therefore incorrect.

126. D A cross-examiner is given broad leeway in attempting to impeach a
witness  intrinsically  (i.e.,  by  eliciting  testimony  from  that  very
witness). In general, a cross-examination question is proper if it has a
logical tendency to discredit the testimony of the witness being cross-
examined. A witness thus may be questioned about any facts that tend
to show that the nature of his or her relationship to a party gives him
or  her  a  bias  (i.e.,  motive  to  be  less  than  objective  in  his  or  her
testimony).  Since  the  defendant's  accusation  that  the  witness  was
dishonest would be likely to result in making the witness angry at the
defendant  and  therefore  biased,  the  question  is  proper  and  the
objection should be overruled.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the
matter asserted in that statement. If the defendant's statement that the
witness  was  dishonest  were  offered  to  prove  that  the  witness  was
dishonest, it would be hearsay. Since it is offered for another purpose
(i.e., to show that the witness is biased), however, it is not hearsay. A
is therefore incorrect. An admission is a declaration by a party that is
offered  against  that  party.  Since  the  defendant's  declaration  that  the
witness was dishonest would be offered in favor of the defendant, it
is not an admission. B is therefore incorrect. Extrinsic impeachment
is evidence tending to impeach a witness that does not come from that
witness's  own  testimony.  Since  the  evidence  that  would  tend  to
impeach the witness is sought from the witness himself, it cannot be
called “extrinsic.” C is therefore incorrect.

127.  B  In  general,  evidence  of  a  defendant's  character  or  disposition  is
inadmissible  for  the  purpose  of  proving  that  he  or  she  acted  in  a
particular  way  on  a  particular  occasion.  An  exception  is  made,
however,  for  evidence  that  shows  a  definite,  particular,  and  strong
inference  that  the  defendant  did  the  precise  act  charged.  Included  in

724

this exception is evidence tending to establish that the defendant uses
a  distinctive  modus  operandus  (MO),  or  method  of  operation.  For
this  reason,  the  fact  that  the  defendant  previously  smuggled  cocaine
using  a  brass  statue  with  a  false  bottom  could  be  admissible.
Although  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  admit  the  evidence  for
this  purpose,  B  is  the  only  answer  listed  that  could  possibly  be
correct.

FRE  406  permits  evidence  of  habit  to  be  used  as  circumstantial
evidence  that  on  a  particular  occasion,  the  defendant's  conduct  was
consistent  with  his  or  her  habit.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because
habit  evidence  requires  a  showing  that  the  actor  in  question
consistently acts in a particular way, and one prior experience is not
sufficient  to  establish  a  habit.  Although  evidence  of  a  defendant's
previous  conduct  is  inadmissible  if  offered  against  him  or  her  for
some purposes, it may be admissible if offered against him or her for
others. C is thus incorrect because it is over-inclusive. Evidence of a
prior  conviction  is  not  usually  admissible  for  the  purpose  of
impeaching  a  witness  if  the  conviction  occurred  more  than  10  years
prior  to  the  trial  at  which  it  is  offered.  D  is  incorrect,  however,
because  the  defendant's  prior  conviction  is  not  being  offered  to
impeach his credibility but rather to establish a distinctive MO.

128.  C  Evidence  of  a  scientific  test  or  experiment  is  admissible  only  if  a
foundation  is  laid  that  indicates  the  substantial  identity  of  material
conditions. Thus, if the test conditions were not substantially the same
as the conditions that existed at the time of the accident, evidence of
the test and its results should be excluded.

A  is  incorrect  because  a  film  may  be  authenticated  by  anyone  who
knows  it  to  be  an  accurate  representation  of  what  it  purports  to  be.
The best evidence rule provides that when the contents of a document
are in dispute, secondary evidence is not admissible in the absence of
a showing that the original or a qualified duplicate is not available.
Since there is no dispute about the contents of any document, the best
evidence rule is not applicable, and B is incorrect. D is incorrect for
the reasons given above.

129. D Evidence of past crimes might be admissible to impeach a witness's
credibility but never solely for the purpose of showing that a criminal
defendant  had  a  disposition  to  commit  a  particular  kind  of  crime.
Since  there  is  no  indication  that  the  defendant  testified,  there  is  no

725

reason to impeach his credibility.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

130. C Under FRE 803, records “kept in the course of a regularly conducted
business activity” can be admitted if they are made at or near the time
of the event, by a person with knowledge, who makes the record as a
regular  practice,  and  there  is  no  indication  of  the  record's
untrustworthiness. Here, the manager testified he regularly made notes
of client protests as part of his job, and there is no indication in the
facts that the file is untrustworthy. Therefore, C is the best answer. B
is incorrect because FRE 803(7) allows business records to be used
to prove the nonoccurrence of an event. Because this is an exception
to the hearsay rule, A is incorrect.

D is incorrect because the fact the manager used the file to refresh his
recollection would not make the file admissible evidence.

131. B Prior inconsistent statements made by a witness may be used to attack
that witness's testimony because those statements tend to show that the
witness's  testimony  is  not  believable.  Therefore,  C  is  incorrect.
However,  since  the  second  witness's  statement  was  not  made  under
oath and does not invoke any hearsay exception, it can only be used
for  impeachment  and  not  to  prove  that  the  defendant  was  texting.
Therefore, A is incorrect.

D is incorrect because FRE 607 allows the credibility of a witness to
be attacked by any party.

132.  C  Hearsay  is  an  out-of-court  assertion  offered  for  the  purpose  of
proving  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted.  Thus,  if  the  witness's
statement is being offered to prove a man killed the victim instead of
the  female  defendant,  it  is  inadmissible  hearsay.  Therefore,  A  is
incorrect.

A declaration against interest is a statement made by an unavailable
declarant that is against the declarant's interest when made. This is an
exception to the hearsay rule. Here, there is no indication the witness
is not available. Therefore, B is incorrect. D is incorrect because the
issue here is that the statement is hearsay, not that it might be unfairly
prejudicial.

PROPERTY QUESTIONS

1. The landowner owned a five-acre tract of land in fee simple. In

desperate need of money, the landowner prepared a deed purporting to
convey the realty in fee simple to “Bearer” and took it to the office of a
real estate investor. For a cash payment of $500 that the real estate
investor paid him on the spot, the landowner signed the deed and
handed it to the real estate investor saying, “You own it now.”

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that no document purporting to
convey any interest in real property shall be recorded unless it is in
writing; clearly identifies the grantor, the grantee, and the interest
conveyed; and is signed and acknowledged by the grantor.

The real estate investor subsequently instituted a proceeding to eject
the landowner from the land. The landowner defended by asserting
that he held a fee simple in the land and was therefore entitled to
possess it. Which of the following arguments would most effectively
support the landowner's assertion?

(A) The deed was unrecordable.

(B) The deed failed to identify the grantee.

(C) $500 was inadequate consideration.

(D) The landowner acted under economic duress in selling the land to

the real estate investor.

2. Twenty-two years ago, a farmer built a chicken coop near the edge of

his yard. In fact, about one-third of the structure was built on the
neighboring parcel of land. The neighbor has demanded that the farmer
remove the part of his chicken coop that encroaches upon his land. The
farmer has refused to do so, claiming that he has become the owner of
that part of the neighbor's land by adverse possession. A statute in the
jurisdiction fixes the period of time for acquiring title to land by
adverse possession at 20 years. The neighbor has instituted legal
proceedings against the farmer for an order directing the farmer to
remove the encroachment, and the farmer has filed a counterclaim,
requesting a judgment declaring him to be the owner of the portion of
the neighbor's land on which his chicken coop encroaches.

Which of the following additional facts, if it were the only one true,

730

would be LEAST likely to result in a judgment for the neighbor?

(A) Ever since he built the chicken coop, the farmer has given the

owner of the neighbor's land one dozen eggs per week in return for
permission to encroach on the land.

(B) After a portion of the chicken coop had been built on the neighbor's

land, the owner of the neighbor's land told the farmer that it could
remain there so long as the farmer used it to house chickens.

(C) Soon after building the chicken coop, the farmer told the owner of

the neighbor's land that he realized that he was encroaching, and
that he would remove the encroachment whenever the owner of the
neighbor's land asked him to.

(D) The neighbor purchased the land from the prior owner 15 years

after the chicken coop was built and commenced the action against
the farmer 6 years after acquiring title.

3. In 1996, the landowner bought Blackacre. A doctor owned the

neighboring parcel, Whiteacre. The doctor used a path over Blackacre
every day to walk from his home to his office in town. He did so for
eight years, and many of the neighbors jokingly referred to it as the
“doc's path,” although he was using it without the landowner's
permission. When the doctor faced some money problems, the
landowner bought Whiteacre and held it for one year. During that year,
the doctor continued to occupy Whiteacre as a tenant and use the path.
The landowner then sold Whiteacre to a dentist, who used the path for
another seven years. In 2012, the landowner decided to put a
swimming pool across the path. The dentist claimed the landowner
could not do so because he had gained an easement by prescription.
The statutory period was 10 years. Did the dentist have a prescriptive
easement to use the path?

(A) Yes, because there can be tacking on the dominant side of a

prescriptive easement.

(B) Yes, because the doctor's and dentist's use of the path was hostile.

(C) Yes, under the doctrine of easement by estoppel.

(D) No, because the doctor's use was not hostile when the landowner

owned Whiteacre.

4. A landowner, who was ill, executed a deed to her home naming her

sons as joint tenants with full right of survivorship. Because her older

731

son was on an extended trip out of the country, she handed the deed to
her younger son, saying that she wanted him to let the older son know
about it as soon as possible. She told her younger son that she was
conveying the property while she was alive because she did not want
her sons to be responsible for inheritance tax, but that she wished to
continue living in the house until her death. The younger son had the
deed duly recorded and then returned it to the landowner, asking that
she keep it for him in her safe deposit box. The landowner continued
living in the home until the time of her death one month later. The
younger son died the following week without occupying the realty and
without telling the older son about the conveyance. The landowner's
will left all her property to her sister. The younger son's will left all
his property to his friend. Who is entitled to the realty?

(A) The friend, because the landowner delivered the deed only to her

younger son, and the younger son devised the property to the friend.

(B) The sister, because the landowner delivered the deed to her

younger son in an attempt to avoid tax liability while making a
testamentary disposition.

(C) The sister, because the younger son never occupied the realty and

the deed was in the landowner's possession at the time of her death.

(D) The older son, because the younger son received the deed as the

older son's agent and the older son succeeded to the younger son's
interest on the younger son's death.

5. A landowner sued to quiet title to a certain parcel of realty, seeking
judgment declaring her as its owner. A farmer opposed her claim,
asserting that she had delivered to the farmer a deed purporting to
convey all her interest in the realty. Which of the following additional
facts or inferences, if it was the only one true, would provide the
landowner with the most effective argument in response to the farmer's
assertion?

(A) The farmer gave no consideration for the conveyance.

(B) The deed did not indicate what interest was being conveyed.

(C) The deed was not signed by the landowner or her agent.

(D) The deed was not recorded.

6. After looking at most of the real estate in the county, a real estate

investor decided that a rancher's ranch would be ideal for the golf

732

course and country club that he wanted to build. Since the two-story
ranch residence building was in good condition, the real estate investor
planned to renovate and convert it into the club restaurant. The other
buildings on the ranch were old and run-down, and it was the real
estate investor's intention to tear them down. After negotiations, the
real estate investor and the rancher entered into a contract for the sale
of the farm, describing it as follows: “All that realty known as The
Flying L Ranch, and identified as Tract 14, Lot 249, Parcel 61 in the
Tract Index maintained by the office of the Recorder of the County of
Parsons; said realty consisting of 240 acres more or less, one two-
story residential building, one 60-foot-by-140-foot cattle barn, and
nine small wooden sheds measuring approximately 50 square feet
each.” The contract set the purchase price at $240,000, with title to
close two months from the date that the contract was signed. Two
weeks after signing the contract, the real estate investor experienced a
drastic change in his financial position and decided not to go through
with the purchase of the ranch.

Before the real estate investor had a chance to contact the rancher
about his change in plans, a severe windstorm blew down two of the
small wooden sheds on the property. Immediately after the destruction
of the two sheds, the real estate investor notified the rancher that he
would not purchase the ranch on the ground that part of the realty had
been destroyed. In a jurisdiction that has rejected the doctrine of
equitable conversion, if the rancher sued the real estate investor for
damages resulting from the real estate investor's refusal to conclude
the sale, the court should find for

(A) the real estate investor, because the realty no longer conforms to the

description of it in the contract of sale.

(B) the real estate investor, because the risk of loss from causes not the

fault of either party remained with the rancher until the closing of
title.

(C) the rancher, because the risk of loss from causes not the fault of
either party passed to the real estate investor immediately upon
execution of the contract.

(D) the rancher, because the sheds were not essential parts of the realty
and abatement of the purchase price would have been a suitable
remedy.

733

7. The plaintiff orally gave permission for defendant to build a road

across the plaintiff's land so the defendant could get from his land to
the public highway. The defendant hired a construction crew and
bought materials to dig and pave the road. Six months after the road
was completed, the plaintiff told the defendant he was revoking his
permission. He then sued the defendant for trespass. In determining the
defendant's rights to the road, the court should find

(A) the defendant had a revocable license.

(B) the defendant had no right to the road because the license to use it

violated the Statute of Frauds.

(C) the defendant had an irrevocable license.

(D) the defendant had an irrevocable easement.

8. The developer was the owner of a tract of realty that she divided into
40 lots in accordance with the state's subdivision statute. When the
developer prepared deeds to all the lots in the subdivision, the deeds
to all lots numbered 21 through 40 contained language restricting the
use of the land to one-story single-family residences, but the deeds to
lots numbered 1 through 20 contained no such restriction. The
developer sold Lot 1 to the first buyer, conveying it by a deed that
contained no restrictions. A second buyer subsequently purchased lots
numbered 25 through 30 from the developer for investment purposes,
receiving deeds containing the above restriction. Before construction
began on any of the lots in the subdivision, the second buyer sold Lot
25 to a third buyer, conveying it by a deed that contained no
restrictions. Lots 1 and 25 were located across the street from each
other, each visible to the other.

The third buyer began construction of a three-story, three-family
residence on Lot 25, and the first buyer sued for an injunction to
prevent its construction. Which of the following would be the third
buyer's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The deed that she received did not mention any restriction in the

use of Lot 25.

(B) The deed that the first buyer received did not mention any

restriction in the use of Lot 25.

(C) The first buyer was not aware of the restriction contained in the
deed to Lot 25 and did not rely on it in purchasing Lot 1.

734

(D) The restriction in the deed to Lot 25 did not touch and concern the

land.

9. As part of a divorce settlement between husband and wife, the wife
conveyed a parcel of realty “to my ex-husband for life; remainder to
my children who survive my ex-husband.” Which of the following
interests does the ex-husband have the power to convey to the buyer?

(A) The right to possess the realty until the ex-husband's death.

(B) The right to possess the realty until his ex-wife's death.

(C) The right to possess the realty until the death of the buyer.

(D) No right to possess the realty.

10. The landowner was the owner of six acres of land, the northern

boundary of which fronted on a road, and the southern boundary of
which fronted on a lake. The landowner's house was located in the
middle of the property, about halfway between the road and the lake.
Pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction, he divided the land into three
lots. Lot 1, the northernmost lot, fronted on the road. Lot 3, the
southernmost lot, fronted on the lake. Lot 2, which contained the
landowner's house, was located between Lots 1 and 3, with no frontage
on either the road or the lake. The only ingress and egress to Lot 2 was
over a clearly marked and graded dirt driveway that crossed Lot 1,
connecting Lot 2 with the road.

The landowner continued to live in his house on Lot 2, but he sold Lot
1 to a man. The deed to the man reserved an easement over the dirt
driveway that connected Lot 2 with the road.

Five years after the landowner's conveyance to the man, the county
constructed a new road along the westernmost boundary of Lots 1, 2,
and 3. The new road led from the old road to the lake. The landowner
began using the new road for ingress and egress to his property,
maintaining but not using the dirt driveway that crossed Lot 1. If the
man, desiring to sell Lot 1, brought an action to enjoin the landowner
from further use of the right of way across Lot 1, the court should find
for

(A) the landowner, because his easement was created by express

reservation.

(B) the landowner, because an implied easement by necessity does not

735

terminate upon the termination of the necessity.

(C) the man, because an implied easement by necessity terminates upon

termination of the necessity.

(D) the man, because continued use of the easement by the landowner

will unreasonably reduce the value of Lot 1.

11. A landowner was the owner in fee simple absolute of a parcel of land.
He executed a valid will in which he devised the land to “those of my
children who survive me, to hold equally, share and share alike, as
joint tenants and not as tenants in common, with full right of
survivorship.” The landowner's son and daughter, both adults, were his
only living children at the time his will was executed. Three months
later, the son borrowed money from a financial institution, executing a
note secured by a mortgage on the land. Soon afterwards, the son
committed suicide without repaying the loan. The following year, the
landowner died, survived only by his daughter.

The jurisdiction has a statute that provides that a mortgagee of realty
holds equitable title to the realty. Which of the following statements
best describes the daughter's interest in the land following the death of
the landowner?

(A) The daughter holds the land as a joint tenant with the financial

institution.

(B) The daughter holds the land as a tenant in common with the

financial institution.

(C) The daughter is the sole owner of the land, subject to the financial

institution's lien for the amount owing by the son.

(D) The daughter is the sole owner of the land, and her interest is not

subject to any lien on behalf of the financial institution.

12. A woman was the owner of a parcel of undeveloped land. When she
died, her will devised the land to her husband, “for life, remainder to
such person as my husband shall designate by his will.” Three months
after the woman's death, the husband married his second wife. As a
wedding present, he executed a deed purporting to convey the land to
his second wife in fee simple absolute. The day after executing the
deed, the husband died intestate, survived only by his second wife. The
second wife subsequently agreed to sell the land to a buyer by a
contract that required the conveyance of marketable title. The deed

736

tendered by the second wife did not contain a covenant of general
warranty. On the day set for closing, the buyer refused to accept the
deed tendered by the second wife and demanded the return of his
deposit. In litigation between the second wife and the buyer, a court
should find for

(A) the buyer, because the deed tendered by the second wife did not

contain a covenant of general warranty.

(B) the buyer, because the land reverted to the woman's estate upon the

death of the husband.

(C) the second wife, because the husband's conveyance to his second
wife was a valid exercise of the power of appointment that he
received under the woman's will.

(D) the second wife, because she was the only person qualified to

inherit from the husband under the laws of intestacy.

13. A donor executed a deed to his land that contained the following

clause:

To Senior Center, for so long as the realty shall be used as a home for
the elderly, but if racial discrimination is practiced in the admission of
residents to said home, to Senior Life for so long as the realty shall be
used as a home for the elderly.

Senior Center and Senior Life were both charitable institutions
devoted to the needs of indigent elderly persons.

On the day after the deed was executed, the donor's interest in the land
is best described as

(A) a valid reversion.

(B) a valid possibility of reverter.

(C) a valid right of reentry.

(D) void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.

14. A landowner sold a parcel of land to a buyer. The land consisted of

100 acres, of which 30 acres were wooded and the rest was livestock
pasture. The purchase price was $100,000, of which the buyer paid
$50,000 in cash. The balance of $50,000 was to be paid in full 10
years after the closing of title, with interest of 8 percent per annum to

737

be paid on a monthly basis until then. After receiving title to the land,
the buyer entered into possession and paid the interest to the landowner
as agreed. In addition, the buyer paid real estate taxes of $1,000 per
year as they came due. After occupying the realty with his wife for nine
years, the buyer died. His will devised the land to his wife for life,
remainder to the buyer's brother. After the buyer's death, his wife
remained on the land, making monthly interest payments to the
landowner. The next year, the balance of the purchase price became
due, and the wife received a tax bill from the county assessor for
$1,000.

As between the wife and the buyer's brother, which of the following
correctly states their respective obligations regarding payment of the
real estate taxes and principal balance owed by the buyer?

(A) The wife is obligated to pay the real estate taxes and to pay

$50,000 to the landowner.

(B) The wife is obligated to pay the real estate taxes, but the brother is

obligated to pay $50,000 to the landowner.

(C) The brother is obligated to pay the real estate taxes, but the wife is

obligated to pay $50,000 to the landowner.

(D) The brother is obligated to pay the real estate taxes and to pay

$50,000 to the landowner.

15. The landowner willed her realty “to my nephew for 20 years,

remainder to my niece if she is living at that time; but if my niece is not
living at the termination of my nephew's estate, to the oldest child of
my niece who is living at the time of my death.” The landowner died in
January 1990, survived by her nephew, her niece, and the niece's son,
who was 14 years old. In January 1991, a hunter moved onto the realty,
living in a shack that he constructed from discarded packing crates.
The niece died in 1999. In January 2010, 20 years after the death of the
landowner, the niece's son discovered that the hunter had been in
possession of the realty for 19 years. He made no attempt to have the
hunter removed from the realty until January 2012, when the hunter had
been in possession for 21 years. A statute in the jurisdiction fixes the
period for acquisition of title by adverse possession at 20 years.
Another statute fixes the age of majority at 18 years.

If the niece's son sued to have the hunter removed from the realty in

738

January 2012, the court should find for

(A) the son, because the period of adverse possession began running
against him when he became the owner of the realty in 2010.

(B) the son, because the period of adverse possession began running

against him when the niece died in 1999.

(C) the son, because the period of adverse possession began running

against him when he was no longer an infant under the laws of the
jurisdiction.

(D) the hunter.

16. A man owed a bank $50,000 in credit card debt. When the man fell

behind on his payments, the bank told him that if he did not arrange to
give the bank adequate security, the bank would sue him. The man's
father thereafter signed a mortgage to the bank of his home to secure
repayment by the man of the debt to the bank. However, the man's
father did not sign any documents that made him personally liable on
the man's debt to the bank. Is the mortgage valid?

(A) No, because the man's father cannot mortgage his property to secure

repayment of the debt of another.

(B) No, because the man's father did not receive any direct benefit for

granting the mortgage.

(C) No, because the man's father did not guarantee the debt.

(D) Yes.

17. A brother and sister inherited a single-family home from their father.
The property was left to both of them in equal parts and said nothing
about who had the right to occupy the property. The sister chose to live
in the home, while the brother decided to stay in his apartment. The fair
market value of the home was $20,000 a year. The brother asked for
$10,000 in yearly rent from the sister, who refused to pay him. Instead,
she said he was welcome to live with her and her family in the home.

Is the brother entitled to receive rent from his sister?

(A) No, because the father's will said nothing about rental proceeds.

(B) No, because the sister said the brother was welcome to live with

her in the home.

739

(C) Yes, because the sister is occupying the entire home.

(D) Yes, because the home was left to the brother and sister in equal

parts.

18. On January 3, a seller and a buyer entered into a written contract for
the sale of the seller's land. At the time the contract was signed, the
buyer handed the seller a check drawn on a foreign bank in payment of
the entire purchase price. Pursuant to the contract, the seller executed a
deed to the realty and deposited it with a commercial escrow company,
with instructions to deliver the deed to the buyer as soon as the buyer's
check cleared the bank. The buyer's check cleared the bank on January
15, but because of a strike by certain bank employees, the escrow
company did not learn that the check had cleared until January 21 and
did not deliver the deed to the buyer until January 22. On January 17,
the buyer executed a deed purporting to convey the realty to a
developer. A statute in the state makes it a misdemeanor for any person
“to execute any document purporting to convey an interest in real estate
that the person executing said document did not actually hold at the
time the document was executed, regardless of whether the person
executing said document was aware that he or she did not hold the
interest that the document purported to convey.” If the buyer is charged
with violating the above statute by executing a deed to the developer
on January 17, he should be

(A) convicted, because he did not become the owner of the realty until

the deed was delivered on January 22.

(B) convicted, because he did not become the owner of the realty until
January 21, when the escrow company learned that the check had
cleared.

(C) acquitted, because his title to the property relates back to January

15, when his check cleared the bank.

(D) acquitted, because when his check cleared the bank, his title to the

property related back to January 3 when the contract of sale was
executed.

19. After working 20 years for a company, a man was promoted from
assistant manager to manager of a branch located in another state.
When he learned that a new employee was moving to the branch to
replace him as assistant manager, the man offered to sell the new
employee his home for $260,000. After inspecting the premises, the

740

new employee accepted the offer. They entered into a written contract
of sale calling for closing of title six weeks after the signing of the
contract. Because their employer was eager to have them both start at
their new positions as soon as possible, the contract contained a clause
permitting the new employee to move into the house immediately. The
new employee did so a few days after signing the contract of sale. The
man kept the fire insurance policy on the house in effect, planning to
cancel it upon conveying title to the new employee. In addition, the
new employee purchased a policy of fire insurance on the house
immediately after contracting for purchase of the house. Two weeks
after the new employee moved in, a fire of unknown origin partially
destroyed a portion of the roof, the entire kitchen, and parts of the
exterior of the house. The new employee immediately notified the man
that he was unwilling to complete the transaction at the price originally
agreed upon, but that he would be willing to renegotiate to determine a
new price based on the diminished value of the real estate as the result
of the fire.

If the man sues for damages based upon the new employee's
anticipatory repudiation of the contract of sale, the man's most
effective argument would be that the court should find for him because

(A) the risk of loss passed to the new employee when he took
possession of the premises pursuant to the contract.

(B) the new employee purchased a policy of fire insurance covering the

premises prior to the contract.

(C) the man had a policy of insurance insuring him against fire damage

to the house.

(D) a fire is presumed to be the fault of the person who is in possession

at the time it occurs.

20. A developer was the owner of a 40-acre tract of land. Complying with

the state's subdivision law, he subdivided the tract, creating 20
building lots in addition to the necessary public areas. The developer
retained 5 acres, on which he installed a well and water-purifying
equipment. He laid pipes from his water-purifying plant to all the other
lots in the subdivision. Every conveyance of land in his subdivision
contained a restriction requiring the grantee to purchase from the
developer all water used on the realty. A homeowner contracted to
purchase a lot in the subdivision from the developer by a written

741

agreement in which the homeowner agreed that after the closing of title,
he would purchase all water used on the realty from the developer at a
specified price for a period of 10 years. At the closing, the developer
delivered a deed with the aforementioned restriction, but the
homeowner did not sign it. Three years after closing, the homeowner
installed his own well and stopped buying water from the developer. If
the developer asserts a claim for damages against the homeowner, the
court should find for

(A) the developer, because the homeowner contracted to purchase

water from the developer for a period of 10 years.

(B) the developer, because a discrepancy between a contract for the
sale of realty and a conveyance is resolved by looking to the
contract.

(C) the homeowner, because the agreement to purchase water did not

touch and concern the land of the developer.

(D) the homeowner, because the homeowner did not sign the deed.

21. A landowner owned a parcel of real estate that fronted on a major
road. At the other end of the property, mountains rose majestically
toward the sky. The landowner divided the parcel into Lot 1, which
fronted on the road, and Lot 2, which did not. He sold Lot 1 to the
homeowner, conveying title by a deed that reserved a 30-foot-wide
ingress and egress easement for the benefit of Lot 2. The homeowner
immediately constructed a house on Lot 1, taking advantage of the
spectacular view of the mountains by installing a picture window in his
living room on the wall facing Lot 2. A developer then purchased Lot 2
from the landowner, receiving a deed that included the aforementioned
easement over Lot 1.

The developer executed a deed to the electric company, granting it the
right to erect poles on and string wires over his right of way across
Lot 1 for the purpose of bringing power to Lot 2. If the homeowner
sues for an injunction preventing the electric company from erecting
poles on or stringing wires over Lot 1, the court should find for

(A) the homeowner, since an appurtenant easement is not alienable.

(B) the homeowner, since the electric company's proposed activity is

outside the scope of the easement.

(C) the developer, since an appurtenant easement may be divisible for

742

purposes incidental to its contemplated use.

(D) the developer, since every appurtenant easement contains and

includes an easement in gross.

22. A landowner inherited from her grandfather an old building located in
the city. Upon her death, she willed it “to the city, for as long as the
building is used as a theater for the presentation of dance, drama, and
the arts.” Subsequently, the city council passed a valid resolution
empowering the mayor to authorize temporary use of the theater
building by an appropriate production company. The mayor orally
authorized a ballet company to occupy the theater without charge and to
use it for the presentation of dance productions. Three months after
moving into the building, the director of the ballet company advertised
for bids from contractors for the renovation of the building. In
requesting the bids, the director announced that it was his intention to
remove all interior walls from the building, thus converting the
building into a “theater-in-the-round.” The city instituted a proceeding
in which it sought an injunction to prevent the ballet company from
permitting any permanent alteration in the structure of the building. If
the city is successful, it will probably be because the ballet company

(A) paid no rent to the city.

(B) has not entered into any lease with the city.

(C) was a tenant at sufferance.

(D) was guilty of ameliorating waste.

23. A landlord was the owner of a two-bedroom house that he rented to the
tenant pursuant to a three-year lease that provided, “Tenant agrees that
he or she will not assign or sublet the premises without the written
permission of the landlord.” Seven months after taking possession
under the lease, the tenant asked the landlord's permission to sublet the
house for a period of three months. Although the tenant offered to
submit the names of potential subtenants to the landlord for approval,
the landlord said that he would not approve the sublease to any person
under any circumstances. The tenant thereafter sublet the premises to a
sublessor. Which of the following statements is most correct regarding
the rights of the landlord?

(A) The landlord may elect to terminate the lease and evict the

sublessor.

743

(B) The landlord may successfully assert a claim against the tenant for

breach of covenant.

(C) The landlord may elect to terminate the lease and evict the

sublessor, and the landlord may also successfully assert a claim
against the tenant for breach of covenant.

(D) The landlord cannot evict the sublessor, nor may he sue the tenant

for breach of covenant.

24. The landowner died, leaving a will that contained the following

clause:

CLAUSE X — I hereby devise my realty located on Main Avenue to
my  wife  for  life,  remainder  to  those  of  my  children  who  achieve  the
age  of  21  years.  If  any  child  of  mine  shall  predecease  me,  or  if  any
child of mine shall survive me but shall die before achieving the age of
21  years,  that  child's  share  shall  be  distributed  equally  among  any  of
that child's children who shall marry, but if such child of mine shall die
without  issue,  then  his  or  her  share  shall  be  distributed  among  my
children who achieve the age of 21 years.

At the time of the landowner's death, he had no grandchildren and was
survived by three children. Two years after the landowner's death, the
youngest daughter gave birth to a child. One week after the baby's
birth, the youngest daughter died at the age of 20.

If the baby marries at the age of 18, will she be entitled to share in the
Main Avenue property?

(A) Yes, because her interest vested within 21 years after the death of

the landowner.

(B) Yes, because her interest vested within 21 years after the death of

her mother.

(C) No, because at the time of the landowner's death, it was possible

that the baby's interest would not vest until more than 21 years after
the deaths of the landowner's three children.

(D) No, because at the time of her mother's death, it was possible that a
grandchild would subsequently be born who would marry more
than 21 years after the deaths of the landowner's three children.

25. When a woman married her husband, he had a child from a previous

marriage and had acknowledged himself to be the father of an

744

illegitimate child. Together, the woman and her husband had a child.
When the woman died, her will left a parcel of realty “to all children
of my husband, including those children not born of our marriage, and
whether legitimate or illegitimate.” At the time of the woman's death,
the child born to both the woman and her husband has an interest in the
realty that can be described as

(A) vested subject to partial divestment, since the husband may have

more children in his lifetime.

(B) absolutely vested, since the class of persons to whom the realty
was devised closed immediately upon the woman's death.

(C) contingent, since the husband may subsequently acknowledge his
paternity of other illegitimate children in being at the time of the
woman's death.

(D) void, since the birth of a person not in being at the time the interest

was created may affect the child's right in the realty.

26. Forty years ago, the city built a dam on a creek for improvement of the
city water supply. The city already owned the realty on which the dam
was to be built, but before commencing construction, it obtained from
all downstream owners grants of the right to interfere with the creek
water. Each of these grants included a conveyance of the right to
completely stop the flow of the creek by erecting the dam, and of the
right to release water from the dam into the creek when necessary in
the city's discretion for proper management of the dam. All such grants
were properly recorded. Since construction of the dam, the city has not
released water from the dam into the creek. As a result, the creek has
been completely dry for the past 40 years. This year, because of an
extremely wet winter, city hydrologists in charge of dam management
have decided to release water from the dam into the creek. A
landowner is the owner of a 250-acre parcel of realty downstream
from the dam and crossed by the creek.

If the landowner institutes an action for an injunction to prevent the
city from releasing water into the creek, the court should find for

(A) the landowner, because no easement is valid that purports to

authorize the maintenance of a private nuisance.

(B) the landowner, because the right to release water in the creek was

terminated by the city's non-use of it for 40 years.

745

(C) the city, because an incorporeal hereditament lies only in grant.

(D) the city, because it obtained the right to release water into the creek

from all downstream owners before constructing the dam.

27. A tenant leased property from the landlord for two years, ending

January 1, 2013. The tenant paid rent at the end of every month. There
were no communications between the parties during the entire tenancy.
On December 31, the tenant sent a messenger to deliver a rent check
for the same amount as the tenant paid under the prior lease. The tenant
also included a note that read, “I've loved living here. By giving you
this check, I hereby renew my tenancy for one year.” The landlord
refused to accept the check or note and told the messenger to take it
back. On February 1, the landlord told the tenant that he was evicting
the tenant. The tenant argued that he never received any notice of lease
termination. Does the landlord have the right to evict the tenant on
February 1?

(A) No, because the landlord failed to give proper notice.

(B) No, because the tenant indicated his intent to renew and offered

payment.

(C) Yes, because the landlord has the right of election.

(D) Yes, because the landlord constructively evicted the tenant by

refusing his rent payment.

28. The seller and the buyer entered into a written contract for the sale of
the seller's realty. The contract was complete in all other respects, but
it failed to indicate the quality of title to be conveyed or the type of
deed to be used. If the other party failed to perform, who could
successfully sue for breach of contract?

(A) The seller only, because the contract is clear as to the buyer's

obligations.

(B) Either the seller or the buyer, because the contract requires

conveyance of marketable title by whatever deed is customarily
used in the area.

(C) Either the seller or the buyer, because parol evidence is available
as to the intentions of the parties regarding the quality of title to be
conveyed and the type of deed to be used.

(D) Neither the seller nor the buyer, because of lack of mutuality of

746

obligation.

29. Several years ago, a chemical company developed a plan to use
underground pipes for the purpose of transporting non-poisonous
chemical wastes to a waste storage center located several miles away
from its plant. At that time, it began negotiating for the right to lay an
underground pipeline for that purpose across several tracts of realty. In
return for a cash payment, the owner of a parcel of land executed a
right-of-way deed for the installation and maintenance of the pipeline
across his land. The right-of-way deed to the chemical company was
properly recorded. The land passed through several intermediate
conveyances until it was conveyed to the seller about 15 years after the
right-of-way deed was recorded. The intermediate deeds were
recorded, but none mentioned the right of way.

Two years later, the seller agreed to sell the land to the buyer by a
written contract in which, among other things, the seller agreed to
furnish the buyer with an abstract of title. The seller hired a reputable
abstract company to prepare the abstract. The abstract company
prepared an abstract and delivered it to the seller. The abstract
omitted any mention of the right-of-way deed. The seller delivered the
abstract of title to the buyer. After examining the abstract, the buyer
paid the full purchase price to the seller, who conveyed the land to the
buyer by a deed that included covenants of general warranty and
against encumbrances. At the time of closing, the seller, the buyer, and
the abstract company were all unaware of the existence of the right-of-
way deed. After possessing the land for nearly a year, the buyer was
notified by the chemical company that it planned to begin installation
of an underground pipeline on its right of way across the land.

The buyer subsequently asserted a claim against the abstract company
for damages that the buyer sustained as a result of the existence of the
right of way. The court should find for

(A) the abstract company, because it was unaware of the existence of

the right-of-way deed.

(B) the abstract company, because the right-of-way deed was outside

the chain of title.

(C) the buyer, because the buyer was a third-party beneficiary of the

contract between the seller and the abstract company.

747

(D) the buyer, because the deed executed by the seller contained a

covenant against encumbrances.

30. Immediately after World War II, the return of thousands of servicemen
to the city resulted in a severe housing shortage. To ease the problem,
an area at the east end of town that had been used primarily for
agriculture was rezoned for residential use. As soon as the change in
zoning took place, the developer purchased a 200-acre farm located in
that part of the city and subdivided it in accordance with applicable
laws. Setting aside space for public streets, a public school, drainage,
and utility easements, he created 500 building lots. He constructed a
single-family residence on each lot and sold them all. Every deed
contained a covenant restricting the land to single-family residential
use. In addition, a subdivision plan containing a description of the
subdivision and of the deed restrictions was filed and a copy furnished
to all buyers. Many of the residences in the subdivision have since
changed ownership, but all conveyances have contained restrictions
similar to those originally used. Because the developer was primarily
interested in a quick profit, he built the houses cheaply. As a result,
most of them are now in decaying condition. Several of the owners
have reconstructed their homes. A few have torn them down
completely and replaced them with new single-family dwellings. A
builder is the owner of a lot in the subdivision, having inherited it from
his father, who was one of the original purchasers from the developer.
The builder has torn down his house and is about to begin construction
of a three-story professional building in which he is planning to rent
office space to doctors, lawyers, and dentists. A majority of
homeowners oppose any change in the development. If a group of
homeowners in the subdivision sue for an injunction to prevent the
builder from building the office building, are they entitled to the
injunction?

(A) Yes, because of the restrictions contained in the deeds.

(B) Yes, because the majority of homeowners oppose any change in the

development.

(C) No, because most of the buildings in the subdivision are in a state

of decay and therefore require reconstruction.

(D) No, because of the changing character of the neighborhood.

31. The landlord completed construction of a new office building and

748

rented the entire ground floor to the tenant, an attorney, under a three-
year lease that fixed rent at $600 per month. The landlord was unable
to obtain a tenant to rent any other space in the building. Six months
later, the tenant vacated the premises. In a claim by the landlord against
the tenant for rent for the balance of the term, which one of the
following additional facts, if it were the only one true, would be most
likely to result in a judgment for the tenant?

(A) The day after the tenant vacated, the landlord rented the ground
floor to another attorney on a month-to-month basis at a rent of
$500 per month.

(B) The day after the tenant vacated, the landlord began using the

ground floor as a management office for the building.

(C) The reason the tenant vacated was that the building was located in a
part of town not easily accessible by public transportation, and as a
result, many of the tenant's clients refused to travel to see him there.

(D) The reason the tenant vacated was that he had been disbarred and

was disqualified from the practice of law.

32. The seller agreed to sell the buyer a tract of land by a written contract

that said nothing about the interest to be conveyed. The seller
subsequently delivered a deed that was complete in all other respects
but failed to indicate the interest conveyed. The buyer received the
deed and had it duly recorded. Which of the following statements is
most correct about the effect of the deed?

(A) It conveys a fee simple absolute, resulting in liability for damages
if the seller did not in fact hold such an interest at the time the deed
was delivered.

(B) It conveys whatever interest the seller had at the time the deed was

delivered.

(C) It conveys whatever interest the seller had at the time the contract

of sale was formed.

(D) It does not effectively convey any interest in the realty.

33. When the landowner died, he was the owner of 200 acres of

undeveloped land. His will devised the land to his three daughters as
joint tenants with full right of survivorship.

Shortly after the landowner's death, one of the daughters became ill

749

and died. Her will devised her entire interest in the realty to the
youngest daughter. Which of the following most correctly states the
proportional interests that the surviving daughters would hold as a
result?

(A) The surviving daughters would be tenants in common with equal

interests in the realty.

(B) The surviving daughters would be joint tenants with equal interests

in the realty.

(C) The surviving daughters would be tenants in common, with the
youngest daughter holding a two-thirds interest and the other
daughter holding a one-third interest in the realty.

(D) The surviving daughters would be joint tenants, with the youngest
daughter holding a two-thirds interest and the other daughter
holding a one-third interest in the realty.

34. The landowner purchased a 10-acre tract of land from the seller,

paying one-half the purchase price upon closing and giving the seller a
note for the balance secured by a purchase money mortgage. Although
the landowner never missed a payment on the note, the seller
foreclosed on the land six months later by falsely certifying that the
landowner was in default, and by falsely swearing that notice of the
foreclosure proceeding had been given to the landowner as required by
statute. A buyer purchased the land at the resulting foreclosure sale,
receiving a sheriff's deed. The buyer immediately recorded the deed
and took possession of the realty. He constructed a residence on the
land and put a fence up around the building and a small area
surrounding it. Since then, he has openly and continuously occupied the
land enclosed by the fence, but made no use of the land outside it.

The landowner continued making payments to the seller according to
the terms of his note. Because he lived in a distant part of the state, he
was unaware of the foreclosure sale until 11 years later, when he
attempted to sell the realty. Then, when an abstract company informed
him of the sale, he sued for an order setting aside the sheriff's deed to
the buyer and ejecting the buyer from the land. The buyer
counterclaimed for a judgment declaring him to be the owner of the
land by adverse possession.

A statute in the jurisdiction sets the period for acquiring title to realty

750

by adverse possession at 10 years. If the court decides that the sheriff's
deed should be set aside, which of the following comments is most
correct about the buyer's interest in the land?

(A) The buyer has no lawful interest in the land since he possessed it

under color of a title that proved to be defective.

(B) The buyer is the owner of the area surrounded by his fence but has
no lawful interest in the land outside the fence since he did not
occupy or possess it.

(C) The buyer is the owner of all the land, since adverse possession

cannot result in a subdivision of realty.

(D) The buyer is the owner of all the land, since he occupied part of it

under color of title to the entire tract.

35. Several years ago, the landowner conveyed land to the first buyer. The
first buyer immediately resold the land to her partner, the second buyer,
without recording the deed that she had received from the landowner.
The second buyer duly recorded the deed that he received from the first
buyer and resold the land two years later to the third buyer, who
immediately recorded his deed. One year after the third buyer's
purchase of the land, the landowner purported to convey it to the fourth
buyer, who immediately recorded his deed. The jurisdiction has a
statute that provides that no conveyance of real estate is effective
against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice unless it shall
have been recorded. The official recording office does not maintain a
tract index.

If the fourth buyer asserts that his title is superior to the third buyer's
and sues the third buyer to quiet title to the land, which of the
following would be the fourth buyer's most effective argument?

(A) The deed from the first buyer to the second buyer was recorded

outside the chain of title.

(B) The first buyer did not have the power to convey the land.

(C) The landowner was guilty of intentional misrepresentation in the

sale of the land to the fourth buyer.

(D) The second buyer had constructive notice that the first buyer had
not recorded the deed that she received from the landowner.

36. The landowner owned a small parcel of real estate that fronted on a

751

lake, with a dock providing access to the lake. Because his friend
owned a boat and enjoyed fishing on the lake, the landowner told him
orally that he could launch his boat from the dock whenever he wanted.
The landowner subsequently sold the realty to the buyer, advising him
that his friend, the fisherman, had permission to launch his boat from
the dock. When he took title, the buyer assured the landowner that he
would continue to permit the fisherman to use the dock. The next time
the fisherman attempted to do so, however, the buyer ordered him off
the realty and told him not to enter it again.

If the fisherman sues for an order directing the buyer to permit him to
continue using the dock for launching his boat, the court should find for

(A) the fisherman, because the buyer purchased the realty with

knowledge of the fisherman's right.

(B) the fisherman, because an easement in gross survives the sale of the

servient estate.

(C) the buyer, because the fisherman's right to use the dock terminated

or was revoked.

(D) the buyer, because an easement appurtenant does not survive the

sale of the servient estate.

37. In January, the landowner executed a will leaving a tract of land to “my
brother for life, remainder to be divided equally among my brother's
children, share and share alike.” At the time of the will's execution, the
brother had two daughters. In March, his daughters were killed in a
boating accident. The following June, the landowner died. Fifteen
years later, the brother executed a deed to a buyer purporting to convey
“all my right, title, and interest in the land.” A year after he executed
that deed, the brother died without a will. The brother was survived by
his six-year-old son.

Which of the following correctly describes the brother's son's interest
in the land immediately BEFORE the death of the brother?

(A) Vested remainder subject to complete divestment.

(B) Vested remainder subject to partial divestment.

(C) Contingent remainder.

(D) No valid interest.

752

38. The landlord rented a warehouse to the tenant pursuant to a lease that

fixed the rent at $500 payable at the beginning of each month. The lease
contained a provision stating that in the event the tenant failed to pay
rent as agreed, the landlord had the right to terminate the tenancy and
reenter the premises. After the tenant missed two rent payments, the
landlord threatened to institute an eviction proceeding unless the
unpaid rent was paid immediately. The following day, the tenant moved
out, sending the landlord a check for $1,000 in payment of rent already
owing. Also enclosed was an additional check for $500 in payment of
the following month's rent and a letter that stated that it was the tenant's
intention to surrender the premises immediately. The landlord made no
attempt to re-rent the warehouse, and it remained vacant for the
balance of the term of the tenant's lease. Upon its expiration, the
landlord asserted a claim against the tenant for unpaid rent from the
date the tenant vacated until the end of the lease term.

In deciding the landlord's claim against the tenant, the court should
find for

(A) the landlord, since the tenant failed to pay the rent as agreed.

(B) the landlord, since the lease reserved a right of reentry.

(C) the tenant, since the lease reserved the landlord's right of reentry.

(D) the tenant, since, in effect, he gave the landlord a month's notice of

his intention to vacate.

39. The landowner lived on 40 acres of land in a remote area. He split the
land into two 20-acre parcels: Lot 1, which contained his house, and
Lot 2, on which there were no buildings. He subsequently negotiated
for the sale of Lot 2 to a developer. During the course of their
discussions, the developer told the landowner that he planned to build
a small cannery on the land for the commercial processing of locally
grown produce. They subsequently entered into a written contract for
the sale of Lot 2, which contract contained no mention of restrictions
regarding the use of the subject land.

The landowner thereafter realized that the construction of a
commercial cannery on land adjacent to his home might disturb his
peace and quiet and reduce the value of his property. At the time
scheduled for the closing of title, the landowner delivered a deed that
stated: “Grantee does hereby covenant for himself, his successors, and

753

his assigns that the realty conveyed herein shall not be used for any
purpose other than the construction of a single-story residential
building.” The developer read the deed and accepted it, paying the full
purchase price as agreed, but when the landowner asked him to sign
the deed, the developer refused to do so. The following 
day, the developer had the deed recorded in accordance with the law.
Several months later, the developer completed construction of a
commercial cannery on the land.

If the landowner sues the developer for damages resulting from the
developer's construction of the cannery on the land adjacent to the
landowner's, the court should find for

(A) the landowner, because the operation of a commercial cannery
adjacent to a private residence constitutes a private nuisance.

(B) the landowner, because of the restrictive covenant contained in the

deed.

(C) the developer, because at the time the contract was made, the

landowner knew that the developer intended to use the land for the
construction of a commercial cannery.

(D) the developer, because he did not sign the deed containing the

restrictive covenant.

40. A company was a holding company that owned controlling interests in
several agricultural enterprises. Because many of the company's
holdings were expanding rapidly, the company retained a consultant to
project and predict the company's real estate needs for the next 50
years. Based on advice that it received from its consultant, the
company began looking for more land. Because a farmer owned a 400-
acre farm in the vicinity of one of the company's holdings, the company
offered to purchase the land from him. The farmer refused to sell,
saying that he planned to work the land until he retired from farming.
Instead, the farmer and the company entered into a written option
agreement pursuant to which, for an immediate cash payment, the
farmer granted the company the right to purchase the land at a fixed
price 30 years from the date the agreement was executed. The company
did not record the option. The following year, the farmer had a heart
attack and sold the land to a buyer. When he sold the land, the farmer
told the buyer about the company's option.

754

In subsequent litigation, a court should declare that the company's
interest under the option agreement was

(A) invalid, because the company did not record the option agreement.

(B) invalid, under the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(C) valid, because the buyer had actual notice of the option when he

purchased the land from the farmer.

(D) valid, because the company gave consideration for the option.

41. The tenant rented commercial office space from the landlord for a rent
of $3,000 a month. As part of the lease, the tenant was given the right
to exclusive occupancy of the basement of the building to use as
storage. When the tenant moved into the building, it found that the
entire basement was filled with building materials belonging to the
landlord. The landlord promised to move the materials, and the tenant
kept sending requests to the landlord to do so. After six months without
the materials being removed from the basement, the tenant withheld the
entire seventh month's rent but remained in the premises. The landlord
sued the tenant for the month's $3,000 rent. The landlord should
recover

(A) $0.

(B) $3,000 minus that part of the rent that can be apportioned to the

basement.

(C) $3,000 minus the cost of cleaning the basement.

(D) $3,000.

42. A landowner owned two pieces of property. The landowner mortgaged
the first property to the bank, and the second property to a finance
company. The landowner fell behind in his payments on the first
property. The bank got a judgment lien against the landowner because
the loan on the first property went into default and there was not
enough brought in during foreclosure to satisfy the loan. The landowner
then fell behind on his payments on the second property. The finance
company foreclosed on the second property, which, after satisfying the
amount owed to the finance company, resulted in a surplus of $3,000.
The landowner still owed $2,000 to the bank. How should the surplus
be distributed?

(A) The landowner should get $3,000.

755

(B) The bank should get $2,000, and the finance company should get

$1,000.

(C) The bank should get $2,000, and the landowner should get $1,000.

(D) The bank should get $3,000.

43. When the landowner died, among her personal effects was found a

deed by which she purported to convey an interest in her ranch to her
nephew. Based on the deed, the nephew claimed to have an interest in
the realty, but the administratrix of the landowner's estate denied the
claim. Which of the following facts or inferences, if it was the only one
true, would provide the nephew with his most effective argument in
support of his claim?

(A) Before she died, the landowner told the nephew that he would

become the owner of the ranch after she was gone.

(B) The nephew was out of the country on the day that the landowner

executed the deed.

(C) The deed names as grantees, “The landowner and the nephew as

tenants in common.”

(D) The landowner signed the deed two hours prior to her death.

44. Because it was her niece's birthday, a landowner duly executed a deed
by which she conveyed her land to her niece. The landowner was
elderly and had been chronically ill for several years. On days when
she did not feel well enough to go out, she frequently sent her chauffeur
to run errands for her. One morning, she called the chauffeur into her
room and handed him an envelope. “I want you to give this deed to my
niece,” she said. “I also want you to go to the bank and the grocery
store. Be sure and call me before you come home.” The chauffeur went
first to the bank, and then to the grocery store. Then, before going to the
niece's house, he called the landowner to ask whether there was
anything else she wanted him to do. He was advised on the telephone
that the landowner had died soon after he left the house. Upon hearing
this news, he returned immediately, without giving the deed to the
niece. Eventually, the niece learned about the deed and claimed title to
the land.

Which of the following is the most effective argument in opposition to
the niece's claim?

756

(A) Title does not pass until there is a physical delivery to the grantee

or his or her agent.

(B) The landowner died before the deed could be recorded.

(C) The deed remained in the landowner's control until her death.

(D) The deed was an attempted testamentary substitute.

45. In 1984, the landowner died, leaving a will that devised his land, “to

my friend for life, and then to my neighbor.” The friend, who lived in a
distant state, never took possession of the land. In 1986, the friend's
brother moved onto the lands without informing the friend or obtaining
his permission. The friend's brother fenced most of the land, paid the
real estate taxes as they came due, and lived in a house that he
constructed on the land. He continued to occupy the realty until 2012,
when the friend died without ever having learned of his brother's
possession of the land. Under the jurisdiction's applicable statute of
limitations, title by adverse possession may be acquired after 10 years
of continuous, open, notorious, and hostile possession of realty. In
2012, the neighbor discovered that the friend's brother was in
possession of the land and commenced an action to eject him. The
friend's brother counterclaimed, seeking a judicial decree that he had
acquired title by adverse possession.

Which of the following arguments is most likely to result in a victory
for the neighbor?

(A) The friend's brother's possession of the land was not hostile, since

he was the friend's brother.

(B) The friend's brother's possession of the land was not open and

notorious, since the friend did not know that he was occupying it.

(C) The period of limitations did not begin running against the neighbor

until the friend's death in 2012.

(D) Absent a unity of possessory right, no tacking of successive periods

of adverse possession is permitted.

46. In 2012, the landowner died, leaving a will that in pertinent part read
as follows: “I hereby give, devise, and bequeath my land to my
husband for life, remainder to my children. If, however, any of my
children shall predecease my husband, said child's share shall pass to
said child's children to be distributed equally among them, share and

757

share alike.” When the will was executed in 2004, the landowner was
married to her first husband, and they had two sons. Her first husband
died in 2005, in an automobile accident that also killed her eldest son.
Her eldest son had no children. The following year, the landowner
married her second husband. At the time of her death in 2012, the
landowner was survived by her second husband, her youngest son, and
her daughter. Her daughter, who had been born in 2011, was her child
by her second husband.

In a jurisdiction that has abolished the Rule in Shelley's Case but
which applies the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, which of the
following most accurately describes the interests held by the
landowner's children and grandchildren?

(A) The remainder to the landowner's children is valid, but the

substitutionary gift to her grandchildren is void since the size of the
class was not determinable at the time the interest was created.

(B) The remainder to the landowner's children and the substitutionary
gift to her grandchildren are void since it was possible for the
landowner to marry a person who was unborn at the time their
interests were created.

(C) The remainder to the eldest son is valid, but the remainder to the

daughter and the substitutionary gift to her children are void since
their lives were not in being at the time the interest was created.

(D) The remainder to the landowner's children and substitutionary gift

to her grandchildren are valid.

47. The seller conveyed a parcel of land to the buyer by a deed that

contained the following provisions:

The  seller  hereby  conveys  the  described  realty  to  the  buyer  in  fee
simple,  in  return  for  the  buyer's  agreement  that  he  shall  use  the  land
for  residential  purposes  only,  and  that  he  will  require  any  person  to
whom he grants an estate in said land to make the same promise.

The buyer used the land for residential purposes for a period of 22
years, after which he commenced construction of a supermarket on the
land. If the seller institutes an appropriate action in which he seeks a
judgment declaring that the land has reverted to him because of the
change in use, the seller should

758

(A) win, because the language of the deed created a fee simple subject

to an executory limitation.

(B) win, because the buyer has violated a covenant contained in the

deed by which the seller conveyed the property to him.

(C) lose, because the restrictive language of the deed violated the Rule

Against Perpetuities.

(D) lose, because the language of the deed created no more than a

contractual obligation.

48. In a will that is offered for probate today, realty is devised “to my

children, but if my friend is still alive 30 years after my death, to my
friend.” The interest of the friend is

(A) a valid contingent remainder.

(B) a valid executory interest.

(C) an invalid contingent remainder.

(D) an invalid executory interest.

49. A landowner was the owner of a 200-acre parcel of unimproved realty
located on the edge of a town. In 2007, when the area was largely
uninhabited, she platted and obtained government approval for a
subdivision of 100 acres. It was divided into 200 building lots, with
necessary streets, utilities, and drainage easements. All lots were
conveyed during 2007, every deed containing provisions restricting
use of the lots to single-family, one-story residences. Each deed
contained the following language:

The restrictions contained herein are binding on the grantee, and his or
her  heirs  and  assigns,  and  may  be  enforced  by  the  owner  or  lawful
occupant of any lot in the development.

A developer purchased a lot in 2007 and sold it to a homeowner, who
built a one-story single-family residence thereon in 2008. The house
burned down in 2012, and the homeowner applied for a building
permit for the construction of a three-family dwelling on the same site.
In 2010, local zoning laws were changed to allow multiple family
dwellings. If a resident of the subdivision brings an appropriate action
to prevent the construction of a multiple-family dwelling, the court
will most probably

759

(A) not prevent the construction, since zoning laws supersede

restrictions contained in deeds.

(B) not prevent the construction, unless the developer's deed to the
homeowner contained a restriction like that contained in the
landowner's deed to the developer.

(C) prevent the construction, because the restriction contained in the

deeds to the lots runs with the land.

(D) prevent the construction, since a building destroyed by fire must be
replaced, if at all, by a building of the same general character and
use.

50. The landowner held a tract of land in fee simple absolute. On March 1,
she sold it to the first buyer for $30,000 cash, executing and delivering
a deed of general warranty. On April 1, discovering that the first buyer
had never recorded his deed, the landowner purported to sell the realty
to the second buyer, who was unaware that it had been previously sold
to the first buyer. The second buyer recorded her deed on April 13,
after conducting a title search. The third buyer, who knew of the
previous sale to the first buyer, told the second buyer about it on April
15, offering her $28,000 if she would quitclaim the property to him.
Fearful that she might lose the property to the first buyer, the second
buyer accepted the offer, executing and delivering to the third buyer a
quitclaim deed that same day. The first buyer recorded on April 16.
The third buyer recorded on April 17.

The jurisdiction has a recording statute that provides that “No
conveyance of an interest in realty shall be good against subsequent
purchasers unless it shall have been recorded.” Whose interest is
superior?

(A) The first buyer's, since his recording of April 16 placed the third

buyer on constructive notice of his right.

(B) The first buyer's, since the third buyer had actual notice of the sale

to the first buyer.

(C) The third buyer's, since the third buyer purchased for value before

the first buyer recorded his deed.

(D) The third buyer's, since the first buyer acquired no rights in the land

until April 16, which was after the third buyer's purchase from the
second buyer.

760

51. The landowner was the owner of a 100-acre tract of land. After

obtaining the necessary government approval, he platted a 75-acre
subdivision consisting of 135 building lots, with streets and utilities
easements. He then sold the subdivision to a developer, retaining the
other 25 acres for his own residential use. After the developer began
building houses on the subdivision, the telephone company asked the
landowner to grant it an easement across a corner of his land so that it
could bring service to the lots in the subdivision. The landowner
agreed and, by an appropriate written document that the telephone
company duly recorded, granted the telephone company an easement
over a described strip of his land “for the erection of such poles, and
the placement of such wires, as the telephone company shall require
for the purpose of providing telephone service.”

Two years later, a cable television company entered into a contract
with the telephone company pursuant to which it was licensed by the
telephone company to transmit the cable company's television signals
through the telephone company's wires, in return for which it agreed to
pay the telephone company a substantial fee. The cable company
signals sent through the wires were similar to telephone signals, and
neither increased the wear and tear on the telephone company's wires
nor increased the burden on the landowner's land.

If the landowner brings an action against the telephone company for an
order enjoining it from permitting the cable company's use of the
wires, which of the following statements most accurately explains why
the landowner will lose?

(A) All easements appurtenant are freely alienable.

(B) All easements in gross are freely alienable.

(C) Although noncommercial easements in gross are not alienable,

commercial easements in gross are alienable.

(D) The landowner derived commercial benefit from the easement that

he granted the telephone company.

52. On January 1, 2013, a farmer borrowed $15,000 from the bank, signing
a note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The following August 1, the
farmer entered into a valid written contract to sell the farm to the
buyer. The contract contained a provision by which the farmer
promised to deliver title free from encumbrances on or before October

761

10. On October 10, 2013, the farmer executed and delivered to the
buyer a deed that contained a covenant against encumbrances. On
October 11, 2013, the bank duly recorded its mortgage on the farm. On
October 14, 2013, the buyer recorded her deed.

A statute in the jurisdiction states: “In the event of a dispute between
parties claiming conflicting interests in realty, the interest which shall
first have been recorded shall have priority.”

Using funds that she had received from the buyer upon the sale of the
farm, the farmer paid her debt to the bank in full on October 16, 2013,
receiving and duly filing a satisfaction of mortgage. If the buyer
institutes an appropriate action against the farmer for breach of the
covenant against encumbrances, the buyer is entitled to

(A) rescission of the deed, since the covenant was breached at the time

the deed was delivered.

(B) damages for breach of contract, since the covenant was breached at

the time the contract was made.

(C) nominal damages only, since the buyer sustained no actual damages

as a result of the existence of the bank's interest.

(D) nothing, since there has been no breach of the covenant.

53. The tenant was in the business of manufacturing furniture and occupied
a factory building that he rented for that purpose from the landlord.
When the landlord told the tenant that he was thinking of selling the
building, the tenant discussed with his brothers the possibility of
purchasing it as an investment. After negotiation, they bought the
building from the landlord, who conveyed it by a deed that referred to
the grantees but did not specify the tenancy created. The purchase price
was $100,000, of which the three brothers paid half in cash at the time
the deed was delivered. At the same time, the three brothers executed
and delivered a deed of trust to secure a note for the balance of the
purchase price. It was the intention of the three brothers to hold the
building until rising real estate prices made it possible for them to sell
it at a profit. Until then, it was understood that the tenant would
continue to occupy and use it for his business.

Subsequently, after requesting but not receiving contributions from his
brothers, the tenant spent $6,000 to improve the building by adding

762

another bathroom, and $3,000 to preserve the building by repairing the
roof, which had begun to leak. In addition, the tenant alone paid
principal and interest on the outstanding trust deed obligation and all
real estate taxes on the property.

If the tenant does not sue for partition but brings an appropriate action
for contribution against his brothers, which of the following statements
most accurately describes the rights of the parties?

(A) The brothers must pay a portion of the sum that the tenant spent on

improving the property.

(B) The brothers must pay a portion of the sum that the tenant spent to

pay principal, interest, and taxes on the property.

(C) The brothers must pay a portion of the sum that the tenant spent to

pay principal, interest, and taxes on the property, and any right that
the tenant has against the brothers is subject to a setoff for the
reasonable rental value of the premises.

(D) The brothers must pay a portion of the sum that the tenant spent on
improving the property; the brothers must pay a portion of the sum
that the tenant spent to pay principal, interest, and taxes on the
property; and any right that the tenant has against the brothers is
subject to a setoff for the reasonable rental value of the premises.

54. A woman owned a home with a large backyard. Once a year or so, the

woman would hire a company to rake and trim the plants on her
property. Afterwards, the woman always used her truck to dump the
clippings and leaves in a large pile of leaves and branches that her
neighbor already had on a remote part of his five-acre parcel. The
woman's property was too small to have any reasonable place to dump
the clippings and leaves. The neighbor did not give the woman
permission to do this, but he knew about it. The woman did this most
years for 40 years. The neighbor then sold his property to his daughter.
This year, when the woman tried to dump her leaves and branches on
the property, the daughter told her she could no longer do so. The state
has a 20-year adverse possession statute.

Is the woman entitled to continue using the property to dump her
leaves and branches?

(A) Yes, because she did so for 40 years.

763

(B) Yes, because the woman had no other place to dump the clippings

and leaves.

(C) No, because the neighbor knew she was dumping the clippings and

leaves.

(D) No, because the woman only dumped clippings and leaves most

years.

55. The landowner conveyed a tract of land to a man and woman. In which
of the following circumstances are they most likely to hold the land as
tenants by the entirety?

(A) They were not married, but the landowner, believing them to be
married, executed a deed “to [the man and woman] as tenants by
the entirety.”

(B) They had been living together for 20 years but were not married.
The landowner, knowing that they were not married, executed a
deed “to [the man and woman] as tenants by the entirety.”

(C) They were not married but believed themselves to be married.

After the landowner executed a deed “to [the man and woman] as
joint tenants,” They re-conveyed the land to themselves “as tenants
by the entirety.”

(D) They were married, and the landowner executed a deed “to [the

man and woman].”

56. In 2001, the landowner, who owned a tract of land in fee simple

absolute, executed and delivered a valid deed that conveyed the land
“to my sisters as joint tenants and not as tenants in common, with full
right of survivorship.” The older sister died in 2005, leaving a will
that devised “all my interest in the land to my daughter for life, then to
her daughters for life, then to all children of her daughters whenever
born.” The younger sister died in 2007, leaving a will that devised “all
my interest in the land to my friend.” In 2008, the friend quitclaimed
the land to her doctor in return for payment of $20,000.

In 2013, the doctor contracted to sell the land to a dentist, promising to
convey marketable title. When she tendered a general warranty deed
on the date that title was to close, the dentist refused to accept it on the
ground that the doctor's title was unmarketable.

In an appropriate action by the doctor against the dentist for damages

764

resulting from his breach of contract, the court should find for

(A) the doctor, since the younger sister became the sole owner of the

land upon the death of the older sister in 2005.

(B) the doctor, since her tender of a general warranty deed gave the
dentist sufficient protection, even if her title was unmarketable.

(C) the dentist, since a title granted by quitclaim deed is unmarketable.

(D) the dentist, since the devise contained in the will of the older sister

gave interests in the land to her daughter, her granddaughters, and
any potential great-grandchildren.

57. When the tenant graduated from business college, he decided to go into
the retail shoe business. He leased a small store for this purpose from
the landlord for a period of three years. The written lease contained a
clause that prohibited subletting without the written permission of the
landlord. The lease did not contain an express reservation of the
landlord's right to terminate the leasehold in event of a breach. After
six months, the tenant found the shoe business unsatisfactory. He asked
the landlord to release him from the lease, but the landlord refused to
do so. One month later, the tenant assigned the balance of the lease to
an attorney, who moved in immediately. When the landlord learned of
the assignment, he demanded that the attorney vacate the premises.

If the landlord commences an appropriate proceeding to remove the
attorney from the premises on the ground that the assignment to her
was void, the landlord should

(A) win, since the lease prohibited alienation of the leasehold interest.

(B) win, since in the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary, a
tenant may not assign without the landlord's express permission.

(C) lose, since the lease did not contain an express reservation of the

landlord's right to terminate the leasehold in the event of a breach.

(D) lose, since restraints on alienation of estates in land are strictly

construed.

58. The builder constructed an office building and leased it to the tenant
for a period of 20 years. A clause of the lease provided that “nothing
herein shall be construed to prevent the assignment of rights or
obligations hereunder by either the landlord or the tenant.” Three years
later, the tenant assigned his interest under the lease to an investment

765

company, notifying the builder of the assignment. The assignment
agreement was signed by both the tenant and the investment company
and contained a promise by the investment company to make rent
payments directly to the builder.

If the investment company defaults in rent payments, which of the
following statements is most correct about the rights of the builder?

(A) The builder can recover from the investment company as a third-

party beneficiary of the assignment agreement.

(B) The builder cannot recover from the tenant under the lease.

(C) The builder can recover from the investment company but not from

the tenant.

(D) The builder cannot recover from anyone.

59. Assume that a life tenant is in possession of realty, the reasonable

rental value of which exceeds the sum necessary to pay principal and
interest on an obligation secured by an encumbrance on the realty.
Which of the following correctly states the rule regarding the
obligations of the life tenant and remainderman with respect to payment
of an obligation secured by an encumbrance on the realty?

(A) The life tenant must pay both principal and interest.

(B) The life tenant must pay interest, and the remainderman must pay

the principal.

(C) The life tenant must pay the principal, and the remainderman must

pay interest.

(D) The remainderman must pay both principal and interest.

60. A landowner was the owner of a three-acre parcel of undeveloped

land on Barrett Road. This was the only land that he owned on Barrett
Road. On his son's birthday, the landowner executed a deed naming his
son as grantee and containing the following description: “All my
property located on Barrett Road, consisting of four acres of
undeveloped land.”

As soon as he finished executing the deed, the landowner handed it to
his son, saying, “Consider this a birthday present.” The son examined
the deed, thanked his father, and handed it back to him, asking that the
landowner hold the deed for safekeeping. The landowner took it and

766

locked it in the drawer of his desk. The following day, the landowner
died. The executor of the landowner's estate has refused to deliver the
deed to the son and claims that there has been no valid conveyance of
any land by the landowner to his son.

If the son commences an action to quiet title to the realty on Barrett
Road, the son should

(A) lose, since a deed that purports to convey more land than the

grantor owns is void.

(B) lose, since there has been no delivery of the deed.

(C) lose, since there was no consideration for the transfer.

(D) win.

61. A state statute provides that:

No fire insurance proceeds shall be payable under any policy issued
in this state except to a person who holds an insurable interest in the
insured property at the time a fire loss occurs. For purposes of this
section, an insurable interest in realty is held only by the person
suffering the risk of loss.

On May 10, the seller contracted with the buyer for the sale of the
seller's home, title to close on or about July 1. According to the terms
of the contract, the buyer was to move into the house on June 1 and to
pay rent of $350 per month until title closed. On May 11, the buyer
purchased a policy of fire insurance on the house from the insurance
company. The buyer moved in as planned on June 1. On June 10, the
buyer fell asleep while smoking in bed. His cigarette ignited the
bedclothing, causing a fire that severely damaged the house. The buyer
filed the appropriate proof of loss with the insurance company, but the
insurance company refused to pay on the ground that the buyer lacked
the necessary insurable interest. The buyer sued the insurance
company for breach of contract. If the jurisdiction recognizes the
doctrine of equitable conversion, a court should find for

(A) the buyer, since the risk of loss passed to him as soon as he

contracted to purchase the house.

(B) the buyer, since the fire resulted from his negligence.

(C) the insurance company, since the seller was the legal owner of the

767

realty.

(D) the insurance company, since at the time the buyer purchased the
policy of insurance, he had no insurable interest in the realty.

62. When the landowner was 78 years of age, her doctors advised her that
she had a terminal disease. She immediately arranged to have a will
prepared in which she devised her realty “to my twin brother for life,
remainder to his children in fee simple.” At the time of the landowner's
death, her brother was alive and had two living children. The
jurisdiction has a statute permitting the alienation of all future interests
in land.

Which of the following most correctly describes the interest held by
the two children at the time of the landowner's death?

(A) Contingent.

(B) Indefeasibly vested.

(C) Vested subject to complete divestment.

(D) Vested subject to partial divestment.

63. The landowner was the owner in fee simple of a rectangular parcel of

real estate, the north edge of which fronted on the street. He subdivided
it into three lots, identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. Lot 1 was the
northernmost lot, and it fronted on the street. Lot 3 was the
southernmost lot, with Lot 2 located between Lots 1 and 3. After the
subdivision, the landowner conveyed Lot 1 to the first buyer and Lot 2
to the second buyer, and he retained Lot 3 for himself. Since there was
no access to Lots 2 and 3, the deed to the first buyer created an
easement across Lot 1 for access in favor of the occupants of Lots 2
and 3, and the deed to the second buyer created an easement across Lot
2 for access in favor of the occupants of Lot 3.

As soon as she received title, the first buyer constructed a residence
on Lot 1. When it was completed, she sold the property to the third
buyer. The second buyer subsequently built a residence on Lot 2.
Twenty-five years after the second buyer constructed the house, a new
public road was dedicated and built along the westernmost boundary
of Lots 1, 2, and 3, providing convenient access to all three parcels.
When the new public road was completed, the third buyer informed
the second buyer and the landowner that he would no longer allow

768

them to cross his land to get to theirs, and he erected a barrier across
the access road that they had been using.

The landowner then began construction of a three-story, single-family
residence on his lot. In an action by the landowner to enjoin the third
buyer from interfering with his continued use of the right of way across
Lot 1, the court should find for

(A) the landowner, since the removal of the need for the easement did

not affect the right to the easement.

(B) the landowner, since to hold otherwise would adversely affect the

rights of the occupants of Lot 2.

(C) the third buyer, since an easement by necessity terminates when the

need for it ceases to exist.

(D) the third buyer, since the construction of a three-story building by
the landowner will increase the burden of the servient estate.

64. The homeowner's employer transferred him to a branch of the firm
located in another state, so the homeowner listed his home for sale
with a licensed real estate broker. Since the house had not been sold by
the time the homeowner was to move, he signed and delivered to the
broker a power of attorney that stated, “I hereby appoint the broker as
my attorney-in-fact and authorize her to contract for the sale of my
home.” Three weeks later, the buyer offered to buy the homeowner's
home. After showing the buyer the power of attorney that the
homeowner had given her, and after negotiations, the broker prepared a
contract for the sale of the homeowner's home. The contract was
complete in every other respect but said nothing about the kind of deed
that was to be executed. The buyer and the broker both signed the
contract. At the time when title was to pass, the homeowner executed
and tendered a quitclaim deed to the realty, but the buyer refused to
accept it. The use of general warranty deeds is customary in the area. If
the homeowner institutes an action against the buyer for breach of
contract, a court should find for

(A) the homeowner, since the power of attorney was silent as to the
type of deed that the homeowner was willing to execute.

(B) the homeowner, since the title that he held at the time that the deed

was tendered was, in fact, marketable.

(C) the buyer, since the use of general warranty deeds is customary in

769

the area.

(D) the buyer, since a quitclaim deed does not convey valid title to

realty.

65. On March 1, the seller and the buyer entered into a valid written
contract for the sale of the seller's home to the buyer at a price of
$380,000, with title to close on June 15. It was further agreed that the
buyer could move into and occupy the premises until title passed, at a
rent of $500 per month to be added onto the purchase price and paid to
the seller at the time of closing. On April 15, before the closing, a fire
completely destroyed the house. The fire was not the result of fault by
either party.

The jurisdiction applies the doctrine of equitable conversion. In
litigation between the parties, which of the following statements best
describes the rights of the parties?

(A) The buyer is obligated to purchase the premises at the price agreed

in the contract.

(B) The buyer is obligated to purchase the premises, with the price

reduced by the value of the house that was destroyed.

(C) The buyer may choose either to purchase the premises with the

price reduced by the value of the house that was destroyed, or to
cancel the contract and receive a refund of any monies paid by him
to the seller.

(D) The sales contract is canceled by operation of law, and the buyer is

entitled to the return of any monies paid by him to the seller.

66. By a will executed in 2011, the landowner devised a parcel of

commercial land “to my niece and her heirs for as long as the property
is not used for the sale of alcohol; but if the property is ever used for
the sale of alcohol, to the National Cancer Association, a charitable
organization.” The landowner died on July 7, 2013.

In a jurisdiction that applies the common law Rule Against
Perpetuities, permits the alienation of all future interests in land, and
has abolished the destructibility rule, which of the following most
correctly describes the interest of the National Cancer Association in
the land on July 8, 2013?

(A) Valid contingent remainder.

770

(B) Valid executory interest.

(C) Void executory interest.

(D) Void contingent remainder.

67. On January 15, 2013, the landowner executed a deed conveying a

parcel of realty “to my friend and his heirs, but if the property is ever
used as a base to help the United States go to war, then to my dentist
and her heirs.”

On January 16, 2013, the friend's interest in the realty is best
described as

(A) a fee simple absolute.

(B) a fee simple subject to an executory interest.

(C) a quasi-life estate subject to a condition subsequent.

(D) void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.

68. The landowner was the owner of a 40-acre tract of realty, the northern
boundary of which lay along the shore of a lake, and along the southern
boundary of which lay a road. Twenty years ago, the landowner split
the tract into two equal parcels. Parcel 1 fronted on the lake, and
Parcel 2 fronted on the road. Ten years later, the landowner sold a lot
consisting of a three-acre portion of Parcel 1 to the buyer. The buyer's
lot fronted on the lake and was surrounded on its other three sides by
the balance of Parcel 1. Because ingress and egress to the lot without
crossing the landowner's land was impossible, the landowner granted
the buyer an easement from the road to the lot. The easement crossed
Parcels 1 and 2 at a location that was described by metes and bounds
in the grant deed. The buyer built a cabin on the lot and constructed a
driveway leading from the cabin to his easement.

Five years later, the landowner sold the remaining land to the
developer.

The developer subdivided it into 60 building sites, dedicating roads
and drainage easements as required by state law. None of the roads in
the developer's subdivision followed the path of the buyer's easement,
but two paved roads led from the road to the buyer's driveway. The
buyer began using the paved roads as soon as they were completed to
gain ingress and egress to his property. Two months later, the

771

developer began building a house on the site of the buyer's easement.

If the buyer asks a court to stop the developer from building over his
easement, the court should find for

(A) the developer, because the dedication and construction of roads

leading to the buyer's driveway removed the strict necessity for the
initial right of way.

(B) the developer, because unity of ownership resulted in a destruction

by merger of the easement.

(C) the buyer, because he did not consent to relocation of his easement.

(D) the buyer, because an easement in gross is freely alienable by the

holder of the dominant estate.

69. The landowner was the owner in fee simple of a parcel of land. On

May 1, the landowner executed two deeds. Deed #1 purported to grant
an undivided one-quarter interest in the land to the landowner's
chauffeur. Deed #2 purported to grant an undivided one-quarter interest
in the land to the landowner's nephew.

On May 1, the landowner handed the chauffeur Deed #1, saying,
“Because you have been a good and faithful chauffeur for all these
years, I'm giving you this deed. But it isn't to take effect until after my
death.” The chauffeur thanked the landowner and took the deed.

On May 10, the landowner died, leaving no will.

If the chauffeur seeks a judicial declaration that he held a possessory
interest in the land on the landowner's death, which would be his most
effective argument?

(A) The chauffeur's possession of Deed #1 raises an irrebuttable

presumption that the conveyance was effective at the time the deed
was delivered.

(B) On May 1, the chauffeur received a remainder interest in the land.

(C) The deed was a testamentary substitute.

(D) The landowner's death completed delivery of the deed.

70. Due to periodic flooding, the city stopped using a storage yard and

bridge 30 years ago. At that time, a hermit built a wooden shack on that

772

portion of the city's land that had formerly been used as a dirt road
between the storage yard and the bridge. Since then, the hermit has
been living in the shack and has been raising donkeys on the land
formerly used as a dirt road. In addition, he planted a vegetable garden
that produced food for himself and his donkeys.

Earlier this year, the city decided to begin using the storage yard again
and demanded that the hermit remove himself and his possessions. The
hermit refused, asserting that by adverse possession, he had become
the owner of the land that he occupied. A statute in the jurisdiction
conditions ownership by adverse possession on 20 years of
continuous, hostile, open, and notorious possession.

If the city institutes a proceeding to eject the hermit, the outcome is
most likely to turn on whether

(A) the city had knowledge that the hermit was in possession of part of

the city's land.

(B) the jurisdiction permits the acquisition of city property by adverse

possession.

(C) the hermit paid taxes on the land that he occupied.

(D) the hermit occupied the land under color of title.

71. Soon after a husband and wife married, they became interested in the

purchase of a home with a price of $375,000. Because neither of them
had been employed for very long, they were unable to find a bank to
lend them money for the purchase. The seller indicated that he would
be willing to accept a note for part of the purchase price if the husband
and the wife could obtain an acceptable co-signer.

The wife's mother said that she would give them the money for the
down payment and co-sign the note if the wife and the husband
promised to make all payments on the note as they came due, and if the
three of them took title to the property as joint tenants with right of
survivorship. All agreed. On the day that title closed, the wife's
mother paid $25,000 cash to the seller, and she, the husband, and the
wife all signed a note promising to pay the balance, secured by a
mortgage on the realty that they all executed. The seller executed a
deed conveying the realty to the husband, the wife, and the wife's
mother as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

773

The husband and the wife moved into the house, but the wife's mother
never did. The following year, the wife's mother died, leaving a will
purporting to devise her interest in the realty to her friend. The year
after that, the wife and the husband were divorced. The wife
subsequently executed a deed purporting to convey her interest in the
realty to her tennis coach. The husband subsequently executed a deed
purporting to convey his interest in the realty to his neighbor.

Which of the following best describes the interests of the friend,
coach, and neighbor in the realty?

(A) The friend, coach, and neighbor are tenants in common, each

holding a one-third interest.

(B) The coach and neighbor are tenants in common, each holding a one-

half interest.

(C) The coach and neighbor are joint tenants as to a two-thirds interest,

and tenants in common as to a one-third interest.

(D) The friend, coach, and neighbor are joint tenants, each holding a

one-third interest.

72. The landowner was the owner in fee simple absolute of a tract of land.
On January 10, 2013, the landowner borrowed $20,000 from the bank
and executed a note secured by a mortgage on the land. On April 30,
2013, as a 21st-birthday present, the landowner executed a grant deed
conveying the land to his son. The deed made no mention of the
mortgage held by the bank. On May 15, 2013, the bank duly recorded
its mortgage. On May 17, 2013, the son duly recorded his deed.
Neither the landowner nor the son ever made any payments to the bank.

The jurisdiction has a statute that provides that “No conveyance,
transfer, or mortgage of real property shall be good and effectual in
law or equity against creditors or subsequent purchasers for value and
without notice, unless the same be recorded.” If the bank attempts to
foreclose on the mortgage, will it succeed?

(A) Yes, because the landowner executed the mortgage to the bank

before executing the deed to the son.

(B) Yes, because the bank recorded his mortgage before the son

recorded his deed.

(C) No, because the son did not take the land “subject to” the bank's

774

mortgage.

(D) No, because the bank is not a purchaser for value.

73. A tenant leased property from a landlord for one year at a monthly rent
of $3,000. During his tenancy, the tenant built a large outside fireplace.
The fireplace cost $1,000 to build, but was worth $2,000. However,
two months before the end of the lease, the tenant vacated the property.
On the same day, the landlord sold the property to a buyer, who
immediately moved onto the property. The buyer then received a court
order stating the fireplace had become part of the realty.

The tenant sued both the landlord and the buyer, claiming the fireplace
belonged to him and they were unjustly enriched by its sale. How
should the court rule?

(A) Neither the landlord nor the buyer owes the tenant anything.

(B) The buyer owes the tenant $1,000.

(C) The buyer owes the tenant $2,000.

(D) The landlord owes the buyer any profit on the land sale that can be

attributed to the fireplace.

74. The landowner was the owner of two parcels of land, one known as

Greenacre and the other known as Redacre. By a deed dated January 1,
she granted Greenacre “to First Foundation for as long as the realty is
used as a home for the elderly, but if said realty shall ever cease to be
used as a home for the elderly, to Second Foundation.” By a deed dated
January 2, she granted Redacre “to my nephew for life, remainder to
my niece, but if the realty shall ever be used for any purpose other than
residential, to Second Foundation.” First Foundation and Second
Foundation are both charitable organizations.

Second Foundation has a valid future interest in

(A) Greenacre only.

(B) Redacre only.

(C) Greenacre and Redacre.

(D) Neither Greenacre nor Redacre.

75. The landlord leased an office to the tenant for a period of five years by

an agreement that prohibited assignment by the tenant without the

775

landlord's written permission. Two years after taking occupancy, the
tenant requested the landlord's permission to assign the balance of his
leasehold to a store owner. After checking the store owner's credit, the
landlord wrote the tenant that the assignment was acceptable to him so
long as the store owner personally assumed all obligations of the lease.
The tenant's attorney prepared an agreement by which the tenant
assigned all his rights under the lease to the store owner and the store
owner agreed to personally assume all obligations under the lease.
After the agreement was signed by the tenant and the store owner, the
tenant's attorney sent a copy of it to the landlord. The store owner
moved into the premises and began paying rent to the landlord.

After paying rent for six months, the store owner abandoned the
premises and made no further payment. If the landlord asserts a claim
against the tenant for damages resulting from the store owner's non-
payment of rent, the court should find for

(A) the tenant, because the landlord consented to the tenant's assignment

to the store owner.

(B) the tenant, because there was a novation.

(C) the tenant, because the store owner personally assumed all

obligations under the lease.

(D) the landlord.

76. Pursuant to a written lease, the tenant rented a two-acre parcel of realty
from the landlord for a period of two years. During the period of his
tenancy, the tenant made substantial and valuable improvements to the
realty. Prior to the termination of the lease period, the tenant told the
landlord that he intended to remove the improvements. The landlord
objected, asserting that the improvements had become part of the realty
and threatening to sue the tenant if he made any attempts to remove the
improvements. The tenant thereupon sued for a judicial declaration that
he was entitled to remove the improvements.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
tenant?

(A) The value of the improvements made by the tenant exceeded

$20,000.

776

(B) The improvements made by the tenant were not of a kind that the
reasonable landlord would have expected a tenant to make.

(C) The written lease was silent regarding the tenant's right to make or

remove improvements.

(D) The improvements made by the tenant could be removed without

causing any damage to the realty.

77. The landowner was the owner in fee simple of a rectangular parcel of
realty that was 500 feet deep with 100 feet of frontage on the street. He
divided it into two building lots, each 45 feet wide by 500 feet deep,
with a strip 10 feet wide and 500 feet deep between them. He sold one
lot to a doctor and the other to a lawyer, deeding the 10-foot strip
between the lots to both of them as tenants in common. The doctor and
lawyer both wish to construct commercial buildings toward the rear of
their lots and plan to use the 10-foot strip between the lots as a
driveway for access to the buildings in the rear. Each fears, however,
that the other will sell and that the new owner will sue to partition the
10-foot strip, cutting off access to the rear of the lot.

If the doctor and lawyer seek your advice as to how best to prevent
this from happening, you should suggest that they

(A) enter into a contract not to partition, inserting language that

specifically makes the agreement binding on the heirs, assigns, and
successors of each.

(B) convey the property to themselves as joint tenants with right of

survivorship.

(C) take no legal action, since tenants in common have no right of

partition.

(D) partition the strip into two five-foot-wide strips, each granting the
other an easement over his or her strip and recording the right-of-
way deeds.

78. In 2004, the landowner executed a will by which he devised his land
“to my eldest daughter for life; and upon the death of my eldest
daughter, as follows: a one-third interest to the children of my eldest
daughter, a one-third interest to the children of my youngest daughter,
and a one-third interest to the children of my nephew, but if any of my
nephew's children should fail to survive to the age of 25 years, then the
interest of such child or children of my nephew shall pass to all

777

grandchildren of my nephew equally, share and share alike.”

At the time the will was signed, the eldest daughter had a son. In 2008,
the son was heavily in debt to the bank, who was threatening to
commence an involuntary insolvency proceeding against him. To
induce the bank to refrain from commencing the proceeding, the son
executed a quitclaim deed conveying his interest in the land to the
bank.

The landowner died in 2010. In January 2013, the eldest daughter
died. Statutes in the jurisdiction abolish the Rule in Shelley's Case and
permit the alienation of future interests in land.

In August 2013, the son contracted to sell a one-third interest in the
land to the buyer, agreeing to convey marketable title. On the day that
title was to pass, the son tendered a general warranty deed, but the
buyer refused to accept it, asserting that the quitclaim that the son had
executed in 2008 was a cloud on the title. If the son sues the buyer for
breach of contract, the court should find for

(A) the buyer, since a quitclaim deed conveys whatever interest the

grantor possesses at the time of its execution.

(B) the buyer, since the son received no valid interest in the land.

(C) the son, since even if title was not marketable, his tender of a
general warranty deed gave the buyer sufficient protection.

(D) the son, since he held marketable title to a one-third interest in the

land.

79. By grant deed, a landowner conveyed a parcel of realty “to the Church

of the Lord so long as the property is used for church purposes.”

Which of the following best describes the interest held by the
landowner in the realty on the day after his grant to the Church of the
Lord?

(A) Contingent remainder.

(B) Reversion.

(C) Possibility of reverter.

(D) Shifting executory interest.

778

80. The landowner bequeaths his land “to my son for life, then to his
surviving children for life, then to the surviving children of my
daughter.” At the time of conveyance, the landowner's daughter had
three children, and she was 80 years old. The son then died, leaving no
surviving children. The daughter's three children then claimed
possession of the property. The jurisdiction followed the common law
Rule Against Perpetuities. The court should find that

(A) the daughter's three children share the property equally, because it

is impossible for the daughter to have any more children.

(B) the daughter's three children share the property equally, subject to

any later born children.

(C) the daughter's three children share the property equally, because

they were alive at the moment the gift was created.

(D) the daughter's three children have no interest in the property.

81. The landowner was the owner of a parcel of realty that he subdivided
into three lots. Lot 1 was the only one that fronted on the road. Lot 2
was north of Lot 1, and Lot 3 was north of Lot 2. To ensure that the
occupants of Lots 2 and 3 would have access to their property, the
deeds created a 12-foot-wide easement from the road across Lot 1 for
the benefit of Lots 2 and 3, and across Lot 2 for the benefit of Lot 3.
The landowner sold Lot 1 to the first buyer, Lot 2 to the second buyer,
and Lot 3 to the third buyer. The second and third buyers used the
easement for three years, creating by their use a bare dirt road across
Lots 1 and 2. They found, however, that whenever there were heavy
rains, the dirt road became muddy and passage became difficult.
Because the third buyer was in the construction business, he offered to
construct a 24-foot-wide paved road across Lots 1 and 2, at his own
expense, for use by all persons with a legal right to the easement. The
first buyer consented to its construction across Lot 1, but the second
buyer stated that he would not permit the third buyer to construct such a
road on Lot 2. If the third buyer institutes a proceeding for an order
compelling the second buyer to permit the construction across Lot 2,
the court should find for

(A) the third buyer, if the construction is necessary to prevent the road

from becoming muddy after heavy rains.

(B) the third buyer, because he is willing to construct the road at his

own expense.

779

(C) the third buyer, because the construction of a paved road would

improve the values of Lots 2 and 3.

(D) the second buyer, because the construction of such a road would

impose an additional burden on the servient estate.

82. When a couple married, the groom's mother decided to give them a

parcel of land as a wedding present. She executed a deed conveying
the land “to husband and wife, as joint tenants and not as tenants in
common, with full right of survivorship” and handed it to them at the
wedding reception. Two years later, the couple separated. Although
she and the husband did not divorce, the wife began living with another
man. At the man's request, the wife executed a quitclaim purporting to
convey her interest in the land to him. In a jurisdiction that recognizes
tenancy by the entirety, which of the following statements is most
correct about the interest that the man received as a result of the
quitclaim executed by the wife?

(A) The man received no valid interest, since a quitclaim extinguishes
the rights of the person executing it but does not necessarily confer
any rights on the person receiving it.

(B) The man became a joint tenant with the husband, since a quitclaim
conveys whatever title the grantor held at the time of its execution.

(C) The man became a tenant by the entirety with the husband, since a
quitclaim conveys whatever title the grantor held at the time of its
execution.

(D) The man became a tenant in common with the husband, since

conveyance by a joint tenant severs the joint tenancy.

83. The landowner was the owner of a 200-acre parcel of land. Because
he knew that he was dying, the landowner executed a deed purporting
to convey a portion of the land to his sister, who lived in another state.
The deed described the realty conveyed as “a portion of the land 200
feet by 200 feet in size, with its northeastern corner located at the
eastern end of the northern border of the land.” On Sunday, the
landowner placed the deed in an envelope with the proper postage
affixed, addressed it to his sister, and placed it on his dining-room
table with the intention of mailing it the following day. That night, the
landowner died. The following morning, unaware that his father had
died, the landowner's son found the envelope on the table and mailed
it. The sister died on Tuesday. The letter carrier delivered the

780

envelope containing the deed to the sister's house on Wednesday.
Without opening the envelope, the sister's daughter wrote the word
“deceased” across it and handed it back to the letter carrier, asking him
to return it to the sender. The envelope reached the landowner's house
on Friday. When it did, the landowner's son opened the envelope and
tore up the deed that it contained. The landowner's will left everything
he owned to his son. The sister's will left everything she owned to her
daughter. Subsequently, both the landowner's son and the sister's
daughter asserted ownership of the realty described in the deed.

Assume the description was sufficient. In litigation between the
sister's daughter and the landowner's son regarding title to the realty
described in the deed, the court should find for

(A) the landowner's son, because the sister died before the envelope

containing the deed reached her house.

(B) the landowner's son, because the landowner died before the
envelope containing the deed was mailed to the sister.

(C) the sister's daughter, because she did not know that the envelope

contained a deed when she asked the letter carrier to return it to the
sender.

(D) the sister's daughter, because when the deed was mailed to the

sister, the sender relinquished control over it.

84. The lessee leased a parcel of realty from the landlord for a term of five
years. During that term, the entire parcel was taken by eminent domain.
Which of the following statements is correct about the rights of the
lessee?

(A) The lessee may continue to occupy the premises for the balance of

the term unless the leasehold interest was specifically mentioned in
the condemnation award.

(B) The lessee is freed of the obligation to pay rent for the balance of

the term.

(C) The lessee is entitled to a share of the condemnation award based

on the value of the unexpired term of the leasehold less rent that
would have become due during that term.

(D) The lessee is freed of the obligation to pay rent for the balance of
the term, and is also entitled to a share of the condemnation award

781

based on the value of the unexpired term of the leasehold less rent
that would have become due during that term.

85. In 1997, without the landowner's permission, an artist moved onto the
landowner's realty and constructed a dwelling. Since then, she has
lived there continuously, openly, and notoriously. In 2004, the
landowner died, leaving the realty to his two-year-old son. At that
time, an uncle was appointed as the son's legal guardian. In 2007, the
uncle became aware that the artist was in possession of the realty that
the son had inherited from the landowner. In 2013, after the artist had
been in possession of the realty for 16 years, the uncle sued on the
son's behalf to eject the artist. In her defense, the artist asserted that she
had become the owner of the realty by adverse possession.

A statute in the jurisdiction fixes the time for acquiring title by adverse
possession at 15 years.

Has the artist become the owner of the realty by adverse possession?

(A) No, because the statutory period will not begin to run against the

son until he achieves majority at the age of 18 years.

(B) No, because the statutory period began to run against the son when

he inherited the realty in 2004.

(C) No, because the statutory period began to run against the son when
the uncle became aware that the artist was in possession of the
realty in 2007.

(D) Yes.

86. The seller was an architect and interior designer. She lived in a house

that she had designed, and she frequently invited potential clients to her
home so that she could show them the quality of her work. The house
was located on a 20-acre parcel of realty that the seller had inherited
from her grandmother. Because the land had once been part of a farm,
there were many old farm buildings on it, most of which were in a
badly deteriorated condition. The seller used one of these old
buildings as a barn for a horse that she kept as a hobby.

When the seller was offered a position working for a real estate
developer in another state, she decided to sell her realty. She entered
into a valid contract to sell the property to the buyer for $250,000. She
also offered to sell the buyer her horse, but the buyer said that he was

782

not interested in keeping any animals. Since the seller needed to
relocate to her new job location immediately, she gave the buyer
permission to move onto the realty before the closing of title. After the
buyer had done so, and prior to the closing, the building that the seller
had used for a barn burned down as the result of a fire that did no
other damage.

Prior to the date set for closing, the buyer claimed that the purchase
price should be reduced by a sum equivalent to the value of the barn.

If the seller consults you regarding the buyer's claim, you should
advise her that she is entitled to collect the full $250,000

(A) because the barn was not an essential part of the realty.

(B) because the buyer's possession of the realty when the barn burned

down raises a presumption that he was at fault.

(C) if the jurisdiction applies the doctrine of equitable conversion.

(D) unless the barn burned without any fault by the buyer.

87. The landowner was the owner of two adjacent parcels of realty known
as Lot A and Lot B. The northern boundary of Lot A was the southern
boundary of Lot B. An old dirt road crossed both parcels, providing
access to a river that flowed along the southern boundary of Lot A. The
landowner sold Lot B to a doctor by a grant deed containing a river
access easement permitting the holder of Lot B to use the dirt road that
crossed Lot A. Subsequently, the landowner divided Lot A in half. He
retained the southern portion, conveying the northern portion to a
dentist. The deed to the dentist contained no mention of an easement for
river access over the property that the landowner retained. At the
closing, however, the landowner told the dentist that she was welcome
to use the dirt road across his property for river access.

During the next 10 years, the doctor and the dentist frequently used the
dirt road across the landowner's property for gaining access to the
river. Then, because weather conditions made it necessary, the doctor
paved that portion of the road.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that all holders of an easement
shall share equally the expenses of maintaining it.

783

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

When the doctor asked the dentist to contribute to the cost of paving
the dirt road, the dentist refused on the ground that she was not the
holder of an easement. If the doctor asserts a claim against the dentist
under the above statute, the doctor's most effective argument would be
that the dentist held an easement by

(A) dedication.

(B) implication.

(C) express reservation.

(D) express grant.

88. The farmer is the owner of a hillside parcel of land, on which he

grows apples for sale to a company that makes juice from them. For
several years, the farmer has been irrigating his apple trees with water
from a stream that flows across the land. After flowing across the land,
the stream flows through a valley. A homeowner, who owns the valley,
lives there with his family. The homeowner's family uses water from
the stream for household purposes. This year, the farmer informed the
homeowner that he was planning to build a small dam across the
stream so that he would be able to pump water out of it more easily for
irrigating his apple trees. The homeowner immediately instituted a
proceeding to prevent the farmer from constructing the dam.

The jurisdiction determines water rights by applying riparian law.

If it were the only one true, which of the following additional facts or
inferences would be most likely to cause a court to grant the relief
requested by the homeowner?

(A) Construction of a dam will increase the farmer's consumption of

water from the stream.

(B) Construction of a dam will change the natural flow of the stream.

(C) Construction of a dam will cause the farmer to consume more water
from the stream than is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of
the farmer's land.

(D) The farmer can continue to pump water from the stream without

constructing a dam.

89. The landowner executed a document purporting to lease a parcel of

real estate to the tenant for 50 years at an annual rent of $1,000. Twenty

784

years before the scheduled expiration of the lease, the entire parcel
was taken by the state for the construction of a reservoir. At a
condemnation proceeding, the trier of fact found that the balance of the
tenant's leasehold was valued at $30,000. Of the total condemnation
award, the tenant should receive

(A) $30,000, but the tenant will be required to pay the landowner a sum

equivalent to the rent for the balance of the lease term.

(B) nothing, because the tenant's interest violates the Rule Against

Perpetuities.

(C) $30,000, and the tenant will have no further obligation to the

landowner.

(D) $30,000, minus a sum equivalent to the rent for the balance of the
lease term, and the tenant will have no further obligation to the
landowner.

90. Because he wanted a new boat, the landowner borrowed $50,000 from
the bank and executed a note and mortgage on his realty for that amount
in favor of the bank. The bank did not record the mortgage. Five years
later, because he needed money to go into business, the landowner
borrowed $20,000 from the lender, executing a note and trust deed on
his realty for that amount in favor of the lender. The lender recorded
the trust deed immediately. Two years later, the landowner defaulted on
both notes. As a result of a foreclosure proceeding brought jointly by
the bank and the lender, a court approved the sale of the landowner's
realty for $50,000.

The jurisdiction has a recording statute that provides, “No transfer of
an interest in real property shall be good against subsequent
transferees for consideration and without notice unless it is recorded.”

If the bank and the lender both claim a right to the proceeds of the
foreclosure sale, whose claim should receive priority?

(A) The lender, because the mortgage held by the bank was not

recorded.

(B) The lender, because the bank had constructive notice of the trust

deed in favor of the lender.

(C) The bank, because the priority of security interests is not governed

by recording statutes.

785

(D) The bank, because the mortgage held by the bank was a purchase

money mortgage.

91. Soon after they were married, a wife and her husband purchased a
house, taking title as tenants by the entirety. They made a $20,000
down payment and executed a note and mortgage for the balance,
agreeing to make payments of $600 per month. Three months later,
realizing that it would be difficult for them to make the payments, the
wife offered to make her grandmother a part owner if she would help
them pay for the house. The grandmother agreed to contribute $300 per
month toward the payments, and at the grandmother's request, the wife
and her husband executed a deed reconveying the property to
themselves and the grandmother as joint tenants with right of
survivorship. A statute in the jurisdiction permitted a joint tenancy to
be created in this manner. The wife subsequently died, leaving a will
that named her husband as her sole distributee.

Which of the following most correctly describes the relationship
between the husband and the grandmother following the death of the
wife?

(A) Joint tenants, with each holding a one-half interest in the realty.

(B) Joint tenants, with each holding a one-third interest in the realty,

and tenants in common as to the other third.

(C) Tenants in common, with the husband holding a two-thirds interest
in the realty and the grandmother holding a one-third interest in the
realty.

(D) Tenants in common, with each holding a one-half interest in the

realty.

92. A farmer was the owner of a large tract of land on which he grew

crops. Because his income was declining, he decided to subdivide and
sell his land. With government approval, he platted a subdivision
consisting of 50 parcels of land with necessary access and utility
easements. Soon afterwards, he conveyed one of the parcels to his
neighbor by a properly recorded deed that they both signed and that
contained the following language:

The  parties  hereto  hereby  covenant  for  themselves,  their  heirs,
successors,  and  assigns,  that  the  realty  herein  conveyed  shall  not  be
used  for  any  purpose  other  than  residential,  and  that  all  conveyances

786

of realty in the subdivision shall contain this covenant.

The neighbor subsequently sold half of his parcel to a friend,
conveying it by a deed that contained no covenants or restrictions. Six
months later, because he was unable to sell any of the other parcels,
the farmer resumed agricultural activities on his remaining land. At the
same time, the friend began construction of a gas station on the realty
that he had purchased from the neighbor.

The friend commenced a proceeding to prevent the farmer from
engaging in agricultural activities on the land, on the ground that such
activities are not for residential purposes. Which of the following
would be the farmer's most effective argument in opposition to the
friend's proceeding?

(A) The friend's deed contained no language of covenant or restriction.

(B) The farmer did not covenant to refrain from using the land for

agricultural purposes.

(C) The friend and the farmer were not in privity.

(D) The covenant in the farmer's deed to the neighbor did not touch and

concern the land.

93. On January 1, the landlord and the tenant entered into a written

agreement by which the tenant rented a furnished apartment from the
landlord. According to their agreement, the tenant was to occupy the
apartment for one month at a rental of $250 payable in advance. The
agreement further provided that its terms were to be automatically
renewed at the end of each month unless either party terminated it by
giving 20 days of written notice to the other. Upon signing the
agreement and pursuant to its terms, the tenant paid the landlord $150
as a security deposit, with the understanding that the landlord could
elect to apply it to any unpaid rent upon termination of the agreement.

Which of the following best describes the tenant's interest in the realty
after executing the written agreement on January 1?

(A) Tenancy for years.

(B) Tenancy at will.

(C) Periodic tenancy.

(D) Tenancy at sufferance.

787

94. When a farmer died, he left his farm to his son for life, with remainder
to a church. The son tried farming the land for a while but found the
work unpleasant. Although gravel had never before been mined or
removed from the land, the son learned that he could derive a
substantial income by doing so. He therefore dug a deep and extensive
pit on the land from which he began removing gravel for sale to
builders and other commercial purchasers.

If the church asserts a claim against the son because of his removal of
gravel, the court should

(A) grant the church a proportionate share of any profits derived from

the sale of gravel removed from the land.

(B) issue an injunction against further removal of gravel and order the
son to account to the church for profits already derived from the
sale of gravel removed from the land.

(C) deny relief to the church, because no right of action will accrue

until the church's interest becomes possessory at the termination of
the son's estate.

(D) deny relief to the church, because a life tenant is entitled to remove

minerals from an open pit.

95. The landowner's will devised a parcel of realty “to all the children of
my son equally, share and share alike.” At the time of the landowner's
death, his son had two sons. One year after the landowner's death, the
son's third child, a daughter, was born. Because the estate was sizable,
probate court procedures were not completed until several months
after the daughter's birth.

Who received a valid interest in the realty under the landowner's will?

(A) The sons only.

(B) All three children.

(C) All three children, and any other children of the son born

subsequently.

(D) None of the children because the devise of an interest to them is

void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.

96. The landlord, who was the owner of a commercial office building,

leased an office in the building to a lawyer pursuant to a 10-year lease

788

calling for rent in the sum of $1,000 per month. The lawyer occupied
the premises for a period of two years, paying the rent as it became due
each month. At the end of that period, he assigned the balance of the
leasehold to a dentist by a document in which the dentist agreed to be
personally liable for all obligations under the lease and which was
signed by the lawyer and the dentist. Immediately following execution
of the assignment, the lawyer sent a copy of it to the landlord. The
dentist occupied the premises for several years, paying the rent as it
came due. When seven months of the lease period remained, the dentist
assigned the balance of the leasehold to a chiropractor. The
chiropractor did not agree to be personally liable for all obligations
under the lease, and the landlord was not informed of the assignment.
The chiropractor occupied the premises for two months but did not pay
rent. At the end of that period, the chiropractor assigned the balance of
the lease to a psychic. The psychic occupied the premises for five
months without paying rent, abandoning the premises when the lease
expired. When the premises were vacated, a total of seven months' rent
remained unpaid.

The landlord asserted a claim against the lawyer for unpaid rent. The
court should award judgment for the landlord in the sum of

(A) nothing, since the dentist agreed to be personally liable.

(B) $2,000, the rent that accrued while the chiropractor occupied the

premises.

(C) $5,000, the rent that accrued while the psychic occupied the

premises.

(D) $7,000, all unpaid rent.

97. In January 20012, three buyers took title to a parcel of realty as joint

tenants with right of survivorship. In March of that year, after obtaining
the written consent of the two other buyers, the first buyer purported to
convey her interest in the realty to her daughter. In January 2013, the
second buyer died, leaving a will in which he purported to leave his
interest in the realty to his son.

Which of the following most accurately states the interests of the
parties in the realty?

(A) The third buyer, the first buyer's daughter, and the second buyer's
son are tenants in common, each holding an undivided one-third

789

interest.

(B) The third buyer and the first buyer's daughter are joint tenants and
the second buyer's son is a tenant in common, each holding an
undivided one-third interest.

(C) The third buyer and the first buyer's daughter are joint tenants, each

holding an undivided one-half interest.

(D) The third buyer and the first buyer's daughter are tenants in

common, with the third buyer holding an undivided two-thirds
interest and the first buyer's daughter holding an undivided one-
third interest.

98. The landowner, the owner of a summer beach cabin, conveyed it to his
daughter as a gift for her 16th birthday. Two years later, on her 18th
birthday, the daughter went to the cabin for the first time and found a
man in possession of it. When she asked what he was doing there, the
man said, “Anyone who lives around here can tell you that I've been
coming here every summer. I got the landowner's permission.” In fact,
the man had occupied the beach cabin every summer for the past 10
years but had not occupied the cabin during other seasons. The
daughter instituted a proceeding to evict the man. In defense, the man
claimed that he had acquired title to the cabin by adverse possession.
Statutes in the jurisdiction fix the period for acquiring title to realty by
adverse possession at 10 years and the age of majority at 18 years.

Has the man acquired title by adverse possession?

(A) No, because computation of the period of adverse possession

begins anew each time there is a change in ownership of the realty.

(B) No, because for the past two years, the owner of the cabin was

under a legal disability.

(C) Yes, because occupancy only during the summer was consistent

with the appropriate use of the cabin.

(D) Yes, because the man had the landowner's permission to occupy the

cabin during the summers.

99. A landowner was the owner of a parcel of land. On January 11, the

landowner borrowed money from a bank, executing a note secured by a
mortgage on the land. The following March, the landowner conveyed
the land to his niece as a gift by a deed that made no mention of the

790

bank's mortgage. The niece recorded the deed on March 15. The bank
recorded the mortgage on March 18. The jurisdiction has a recording
statute that provides that “no interest in realty shall be good against a
subsequent purchaser for value and without notice unless it shall first
have been recorded.” Payment to the bank was not made as required by
the note, and the bank attempted to foreclose on the land.

When the niece received notice of the foreclosure proceeding, she
opposed it on the ground that her interest was superior to the bank's. Is
the niece correct?

(A) No, because the landowner executed the mortgage to the bank

before executing the conveyance to the niece.

(B) No, because a mortgage is not regarded as an interest in realty

under recording statutes.

(C) Yes, because the niece recorded the deed before the bank recorded

the mortgage.

(D) Yes, because the conveyance to the niece made no mention of the

mortgage.

100. The landowner conveyed a parcel of land “to my son for life, but if my
son should ever use liquor on the premises, to my daughter for life;
then to my grandson.” The grandson's interest is best described as

(A) a reversion.

(B) a contingent remainder.

(C) a vested remainder.

(D) void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.

101. Three brothers held Blackacre as joint tenants. Faced with serious

credit card debt, the eldest brother conveyed his interest to a friend of
his who agreed to pay off the debt. What is the effect of the conveyance
to the friend?

(A) The two younger brothers and the friend hold the property as joint

tenants.

(B) The two younger brothers and the friend hold the property as

tenants in common.

(C) The two younger brothers hold a two-thirds interest in the property

791

as joint tenants.

(D) The friend holds a one-third interest as a joint tenant with the

brothers

102. The landlord was the owner of a commercial building that he leased to

a friend for use as a retail shoe store for a period of five years. In the
lease, the friend covenanted not to assign the premises without the
landlord's written consent. A clause of the lease reserved the
landlord's right to terminate the lease in the event of a breach of this
covenant. Two years after the friend began occupancy, he sold the
business to his store manager. After obtaining the landlord's written
consent, the friend assigned the balance of the lease to the manager.
The manager operated the shoe store for several months and then sold
it to his neighbor. As part of the sale, the manager executed a document
purporting to transfer to the neighbor all remaining rights under the
lease. The manager did not obtain the landlord's permission for this
transfer. When the landlord learned of this transfer to the neighbor, he
instituted a proceeding in which he sought the neighbor's eviction on
the ground that the covenant not to assign had been violated.

Which of the following would be the neighbor's most effective
argument in opposition to the landlord's claim?

(A) The covenant against assignment is void as a restraint against

alienation.

(B) The landlord's only remedy is an action against the manager for

damages resulting from breach of the covenant.

(C) The landlord waived his rights under the covenant by consenting to

the assignment by the friend to the manager.

(D) The transfer by the manager to the neighbor was not an assignment

but a sublease.

103. A business owner owned a lumberyard and a lumber mill. Because a
woman's property was between the lumberyard and the mill, the
business owner bought a 20-foot-wide easement through the woman's
property so his trucks could drive back and forth between the
lumberyard and the mill. Several years later, the business owner called
the woman and said, “I won't need that easement anymore.” Shortly
thereafter, the business owner sold the lumberyard and mill to a buyer.
The buyer relied on the business owner's assertion that he could still

792

drive trucks over the easement when he bought the property. On the
first day the buyer owned the two properties, the buyer tried to drive
his trucks across the easement. However, the woman had put up a
barricade and told the buyer that she would not allow the trucks to
pass without a new agreement. The buyer sued the woman for use of
the easement.

The court should rule in favor of

(A) the buyer, because the business owner only told the woman he

wouldn't need the easement anymore.

(B) the buyer, because the buyer relied on the business owner's

assertion when he bought the properties.

(C) the woman, because the easement was revocable at the will of the

grantor.

(D) the woman, because there is no indication she received any benefit

from the sale.

104. Zoning laws provided that all land on the north side of Main Street
was restricted to residential use, and that commercial use was
permitted on all land on the south side of Main Street. No business
could be operated on land zoned for residential use.

A subdivision was located on the north side of Main Street. The
subdivision plan that had been filed when the subdivision was created
provided that persons occupying realty in the subdivision were
permitted to operate small businesses in their homes, so long as such
operation did not interfere with or annoy other residents in the
subdivision.

A typist operated a typing service from an office in her home in the
subdivision. A buyer entered into a contract to buy the home and the
business. After entering into the contract of sale, however, the buyer
learned of the zoning law that prohibited the operation of any business
in a residential zone. He could not have discovered the zoning
violation by reasonable inquiry prior to entering into the contract of
sale. He immediately informed the typist that he would not go through
with the purchase of the typist's home because of the zoning violation.
If the typist asserts a claim against the buyer for breach of contract, the
court should find for

793

(A) the buyer, because the purchaser of realty cannot be forced to buy

potential litigation.

(B) the buyer, because he could not have discovered the zoning

violation by reasonable inquiry prior to entering into the contract of
sale.

(C) the typist, because the zoning law that prohibited the operation of

the typist's business existed before the contract of sale was formed.

(D) the typist, because her business was permitted by provisions of the

subdivision plan.

105. The landowner conveyed a parcel of realty “to my friend so long as

liquor is not sold on the premises, but if liquor is sold on the premises,
then to the Foundation for Hereditary Diseases.” Two years later, the
friend began selling liquor on the premises.

Which of the following best describes the friend's interest in the realty
on the day before he began selling liquor on the premises?

(A) void, since the interest of the Foundation for Hereditary Diseases

could have vested more than 21 years after the death of all persons
who were in being at the time of the conveyance.

(B) fee simple absolute.

(C) fee simple subject to an executory interest, since the friend's
interest will terminate if liquor is ever sold on the premises.

(D) fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

106. When the seller said that she was interested in selling her home and the
lot on which it stood, the buyer expressed interest in purchasing it.
After negotiations, the buyer and the seller entered into a written
contract that provided that the seller would sell the realty to the buyer
for $260,000 and that delivery of title was to occur on or before
August 1. The seller further promised that at the time title was
delivered the house would be vacant. A clause in the contract provided
that “The risk of loss from non-negligent causes shall remain with the
seller until delivery of title.” On July 15, through no fault of the seller
or the buyer, the house burned down. The seller had not yet moved out
of the house, and title had not yet been transferred to the buyer. The
jurisdiction does not recognize the doctrine of equitable conversion.

794

Following the destruction of the house, if the buyer seeks to rescind
the contract, he

(A) can, since the parties agreed that the risk of loss would not shift to

the buyer until passage of title.

(B) can, since the jurisdiction has rejected the doctrine of equitable

conversion.

(C) cannot, since the jurisdiction does not recognize the doctrine of

equitable conversion.

(D) cannot, because the risk of loss passed to the buyer immediately

upon execution of the contract to purchase.

107. After looking at most of the real estate in the county, a builder decided
that the landowner's ranch, The Dancing L, would be ideal for the golf
course and country club that he wanted to build. After negotiations, the
builder and the landowner entered into a contract for the sale of the
farm, describing it as follows: “All that realty known as The Dancing
L Ranch, and identified as Tract 14, Lot 249, Parcel 61 in the Tract
Index maintained by the office of the Recorder of the County of
Stinson; said realty consisting of 240 acres more or less, one two-story
residential building, one 60-foot by 140-foot cattle barn, and nine
small wooden sheds measuring approximately 50 square feet each.”
This property was the only parcel in the county known as The Dancing
L and identified by these Tract, Lot, and Parcel numbers. Even so, it
was standard practice in the area to use a different method when
describing parcels of land. The contract set the purchase price at
$240,000, with title to close two months from the date that the contract
was signed. Two weeks after signing the contract, the builder
experienced a drastic change in his financial position and decided not
to go through with the purchase of The Dancing L.

At the time and place of closing, the landowner tendered a deed
containing a description of the realty that was identical to that which
appeared in the contract of sale, but the builder refused to accept it. In
a subsequent action by the landowner against the builder for damages
resulting from breach of contract, the court should find for

(A) the landowner, because his land was the only realty in the county

that was known as The Dancing L, and the only parcel identified by
the Tract, Lot, and Parcel numbers used in the contract description.

795

(B) the landowner, because the builder waived any objection to the

validity of the description by signing a contract containing an
identical description.

(C) the builder, because the contract and deed lacked a metes and

bounds description.

(D) the builder, because it was not standard practice in the area to use
descriptions like the one contained in the contract and deed.

108. A brother and sister owned a farm as joint tenants. When the brother
lost his job, he granted a mortgage to the bank, giving the bank a lien
against all of the property. His sister did not know about the mortgage.
The brother then died, and the bank contacted the sister, offering to let
her take over the mortgage payments in her brother's name. When the
sister refused to do so, the bank foreclosed on the property. May the
bank do so?

(A) Yes, because the brother gave it a lien against all of the property.

(B) Yes, because the bank gave the sister an opportunity to assume the

mortgage.

(C) No, because the brother and sister were joint tenants.

(D) No, because the sister did not know of the mortgage until after her

brother's death.

109. The landowner was the owner of six acres of land, the northern

boundary of which fronted on a road and the southern boundary of
which fronted on a lake. The landowner's house was located in the
middle of the property, about halfway between the road and the lake.
Pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction, he divided the land into three
lots. Lot 1, the northernmost lot, fronted on the road. Lot 3, the
southernmost lot, fronted on the lake. Lot 2, which contained the
landowner's house, was located between Lots 1 and 3, with no
frontage on either the road or the lake. The only ingress and egress to
Lot 2 was over a clearly marked and graded dirt driveway that crossed
Lot 1, connecting Lot 2 with the road.

The landowner continued to live in his house on Lot 2, but he sold Lot
1 to the first buyer and Lot 3 to the second buyer. The deed to the first
buyer reserved an easement over the dirt driveway that connected Lot
2 with the road. The landowner had never used the lake, and there was
no clearly marked road or path to it across Lot 3. The deed to the

796

second buyer, however, reserved an easement described by metes and
bounds across Lot 3 for the purpose of access to the lake from Lot 2.

Two years after the landowner's conveyance to the second buyer, the
second buyer sold Lot 3 back to the landowner. One month later, the
landowner conveyed Lot 3 to the third buyer by a deed that made no
mention of any easement over Lot 3. The landowner subsequently sold
his home and Lot 2 to the fourth buyer, executing a deed that granted
the fourth buyer a right of way over Lot 3 for access to the lake,
identical to the easement described in the original grant from the
landowner to the second buyer. When the fourth buyer attempted to
cross Lot 3, however, the third buyer refused to permit him to do so. If
the fourth buyer institutes an action for an injunction directing the third
buyer to refrain from interfering with the fourth buyer's right of way
over Lot 3, the court should find for

(A) the fourth buyer, because the right to cross Lot 3 was expressly

granted by the landowner in the deed to Lot 2.

(B) the fourth buyer, because the easement to cross Lot 3 was created

by the deed that conveyed Lot 3 to the second buyer.

(C) the third buyer, because the landowner's non-use of the easement

across Lot 3 resulted in its termination.

(D) the third buyer, because the easement to cross Lot 3 terminated
when the landowner repurchased Lot 3 from the second buyer.

110. A donor executed a deed to his realty, which contained the following

clause:

To Family Center, for so long as the realty shall be used as a home for
families,  but  if  racial  discrimination  is  practiced  in  the  admission  of
residents to said home, to Family Life for so long as the realty shall be
used as a home for families.

Family Center and Family Life were both charitable institutions
devoted to the needs of indigent families.

On the day after the deed was executed, Family Life's interest in the
land is best described as a

(A) valid contingent remainder.

(B) valid executory interest.

797

(C) void contingent remainder.

(D) void executory interest.

111. A landowner sold a parcel of land to a buyer. The realty consisted of

100 acres, of which 30 acres were wooded and the rest was livestock
pasture. The purchase price was $100,000, of which the buyer paid
$50,000 in cash. The balance of $50,000 was to be paid in full 10
years after the closing of title, with interest of 8 percent per annum to
be paid on a monthly basis until then. After receiving title to the land,
the buyer entered into possession and paid the interest to the
landowner as agreed. In addition, the buyer paid real estate taxes of
$1,000 per year as they came due. After occupying the realty with his
wife for nine years, the buyer died. His will devised the land to his
wife for life, remainder to the buyer's brother. After the buyer's death,
his wife remained on the land, making monthly interest payments to the
landowner.

The fences surrounding the livestock pastures on the realty were in
decaying condition, and the wife made arrangements to have some of
the trees cut down for use in repairing the fences. When the buyer's
brother learned of the wife's plan, he brought a proceeding for an
injunction to prevent her from doing so. In response to the buyer's
brother's petition, a court should find for

(A) the wife, because the cutting of trees on the land was a reasonable

way of maintaining the fences.

(B) the wife, because a life tenant has an unlimited right to make use of

natural resources of the realty.

(C) the buyer's brother, because destruction of trees on a parcel of

realty constitutes ameliorating waste.

(D) the buyer's brother, because the fences were permitted to decay

during the buyer's lifetime.

112. A landowner willed her realty “to my nephew for 20 years, remainder
to my niece if she is living at that time; but if my niece is not living at
the termination of my nephew's estate, to the oldest child of my niece
who is living at the time of my death.” The landowner died in January
1993, survived by her nephew, her niece, and the niece's two children
— a son, who was 14, and a daughter, who was 7.

798

Which of the following correctly describes the interest that the niece's
daughter had in the realty on the day after the death of the landowner?

(A) Vested remainder subject to complete divestment.

(B) Contingent remainder.

(C) Springing executory interest.

(D) No valid interest in the realty.

113. On March 1, a landowner conveyed a tract of realty to her son and
daughter as joint tenants with right of survivorship. On April 1, the
landowner purported to sell that same tract to a buyer by general
warranty deed. The buyer paid cash for the property and was unaware
of the prior conveyance to the landowner's children. The son and
daughter recorded their deed on April 3. The buyer recorded his deed
on April 5. The son died on April 7.

The jurisdiction has a statute that provides, “In determining the
priority of conflicting interests in land, the first such interest to have
been recorded shall have priority.” Who has priority on April 8?

(A) The daughter, because the conveyance to the son and daughter was
recorded before the conveyance to the buyer was recorded.

(B) The daughter, because the realty was conveyed to the son and
daughter before the conveyance to the buyer was recorded.

(C) The buyer, because the daughter's interest did not ripen until after

the buyer's interest was recorded.

(D) The buyer, because the landowner conveyed to him by general

warranty deed.

114. A farmer was the owner of a dairy farm, which included a large

processing plant. About five years ago, the farmer decided to build a
new barn for his animals and borrowed $30,000 for that purpose from
the bank. At the time he made the loan, the farmer executed a note
requiring monthly payments of a specified sum and secured by a
mortgage on the farm. The following year, the farmer sold the farm to a
dairyman, conveying it by a deed that stated, “The realty described
herein is conveyed subject to an existing note and mortgage held by the
bank.”

Several months after buying the farm, the dairyman purchased a new

799

cooling tank for the processing plant. The tank had a 5,000-gallon
capacity and weighed several tons when empty. In installing the
cooling tank, the dairyman had the wooden floor of the farm's
processing plant torn out and replaced with concrete. Brackets were
placed in the wet concrete so that when it hardened they could not be
removed. The new tank was then permanently fastened to the brackets.
The dairyman made several monthly payments to the bank on the
mortgage note but then missed three consecutive payments.

The bank was unsuccessful at collecting on the note, and it instituted
foreclosure proceedings. As a result, an appropriate court directed the
sale of all property subject to the mortgage. Should the cooling tank
purchased and installed by the dairyman be included in the foreclosure
sale?

(A) Yes, because installation of the tank converted it to a fixture.

(B) Yes, because the dairyman made several of the monthly payments.

(C) No, because the cooling tank was brought onto the realty after the

execution of the note and mortgage.

(D) No, because the dairyman took the property “subject to” the

mortgage.

115. A landowner owned a parcel of real estate that fronted on a major
road. At the other end of the property, mountains rose majestically
toward the sky. The landowner divided the parcel into Lot 1, which
fronted on the road, and Lot 2, which did not. He sold Lot 1 to the
homeowner, conveying title by a deed that reserved a 30-foot-wide
ingress and egress easement for the benefit of Lot 2. The homeowner
immediately constructed a house on Lot 1, taking advantage of the
spectacular view of the mountains by installing a picture window in
his living room on the wall facing Lot 2. A developer then purchased
Lot 2 from the landowner, receiving a deed that included the
aforementioned easement over Lot 1. Several years later, the
developer began construction of a home on Lot 2.

The house that the developer was constructing on Lot 2 was to be three
stories tall and would block the view from the homeowner's picture
window of the mountains. If the homeowner seeks an injunction to
prevent the construction of the developer's house in a manner likely to
obstruct the homeowner's view, the court should find for

800

(A) the homeowner, because the homeowner's house was built before

the developer began construction.

(B) the homeowner, because the construction of the developer's house
as planned will interfere with the homeowner's natural easement
for air, light, and view.

(C) the developer, because the homeowner has no right to an

undisturbed view of the mountains.

(D) the developer, because there was no proof he was aware of the

view from the homeowner's picture window when he purchased the
property from the landowner.

116. The landowner died leaving a will that contained the following clause:

I further direct that my realty be sold, and that the proceeds of such
sale be given to a charity to be selected by my executor from among
those to which I made contributions during the year immediately prior
to my death, provided, however, that out of said proceeds $2,000 shall
first be given to each of my children and grandchildren who survive to
the age of 22 years.

At the time of the landowner's death, he had no grandchildren and was
survived by three children, one of whom was 22 years old.

The landowner's realty was sold by the executor of the landowner's
will for a price in excess of $1 million. The 22-year-old demanded the
executor pay her $2,000 under the clause of the landowner's will, but
the executor refused to pay, asserting that the 22-year-old's interest
was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities. The 22-year-old should

(A) lose, because the interests of a charity cannot be made to depend

upon the happening of an event that might occur after expiration of
the period of perpetuities.

(B) lose, because it is possible that a grandchild will be born whose

interest will not vest until more than 21 years after the death of all
persons in being at the time of the landowner's death.

(C) win, because her interest vested upon the landowner's death and is

not dependent upon the number of children or grandchildren who
survive to the age of 22 years.

(D) win, because she is the first person who can possibly qualify to

801

take under the clause.

117. Several years ago, a chemical company developed a plan to use
underground pipes for the purpose of transporting non-poisonous
chemical wastes to a waste storage center located several miles away
from its plant. At that time, it began negotiating for the right to lay an
underground pipeline for that purpose across several tracts of realty. In
return for a cash payment, the owner of Westacre executed a right-of-
way deed for the installation and maintenance of the pipeline across
his land. The right-of-way deed to the chemical company was properly
recorded. Westacre passed through several intermediate conveyances
until it was conveyed to the seller about 15 years after the right-of-way
deed was recorded. The intermediate deeds were recorded, but none
mentioned the right of way.

Two years later, the seller agreed to sell Westacre to the buyer, by a
written contract in which, among other things, the seller agreed to
furnish the buyer with an abstract of title. The seller hired a reputable
abstract company to prepare the abstract. The abstract company
prepared an abstract and delivered it to the seller. The abstract
omitted any mention of the right-of-way deed. The seller delivered the
abstract of title to the buyer. After examining the abstract, the buyer
paid the full purchase price to the seller, who conveyed Westacre to
the buyer by a deed that included covenants of general warranty and
against encumbrances. At the time of closing, the seller, the buyer, and
the abstract company were all unaware of the existence of the right-of-
way deed. After possessing Westacre for nearly a year, the buyer was
notified by the chemical company that it planned to begin installation
of an underground pipeline on its right of way across Westacre.

If the buyer sues the seller because of the presence of the right of way,
the most likely result will be a decision for

(A) the seller, because the buyer relied on the abstract of title prepared

by the abstract company in purchasing Westacre.

(B) the seller, because the seller was without knowledge of any defects

in the title to Westacre.

(C) the buyer, because the covenants in the seller's deed to the buyer

were breached.

(D) the buyer, because the seller negligently misrepresented the

802

condition of title to Westacre.

118. When the landowner died, he was the owner of 200 acres of

undeveloped land. His will devised the land to his three daughters as
joint tenants with right of survivorship.

One of the daughters subsequently sold her share of the land to a friend
by a valid deed containing covenants of general warranty. Which of
the following statements would correctly describe the relationships
between the parties?

(A) The two daughters and the friend hold the land as joint tenants.

(B) The two daughters and the friend hold the land as tenants in

common.

(C) The two daughters and the friend hold the land as tenants in

common, but the daughters have rights of survivorship as to each
other's interests.

(D) The two daughters hold equal shares of a two-thirds interest in the
land as joint tenants, and the friend holds a one-third interest in the
land as a tenant in common.

119. Several years ago, the landowner sold a one-acre parcel of realty to a
prospector, who immediately moved onto the land, built a cabin, and
set up a mechanical apparatus for removing gold from the stream that
flowed across the realty. The prospector never recorded the deed
because he heard that he could save money on taxes that way. Two
years later, the landowner, who was aware that the prospector had not
recorded the deed, purported to sell the land to a policeman by a deed
that the policeman immediately recorded. As a gift, the policeman
subsequently conveyed the land to a grocer, who recorded the
conveyance. Neither the policeman nor the grocer ever saw or
inspected the land. Last month, the grocer sold the land to a lawyer,
delivering a quitclaim deed that the lawyer immediately recorded. The
jurisdiction has a statute providing in essence that no conveyance is
valid against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice unless it
is recorded.

A court declared the lawyer's interest to be inferior to the
prospector's. If the lawyer instituted an action against the grocer for
damages, the court should find for

803

(A) the grocer, unless at the time the grocer conveyed the land to the

lawyer, the grocer was aware that the prospector was in
possession of the land.

(B) the grocer, since his conveyance to the lawyer contained no

covenants of title.

(C) the lawyer, since the grocer did not give value for the land.

(D) the lawyer, if a reasonable inspection by the grocer would have
revealed that the prospector was in possession of the land.

120. A landowner was the owner of a 200-acre parcel of unimproved realty
located on the edge of town. In 2004, when the area was largely
uninhabited, she platted and obtained government approval for a
subdivision of 100 acres to be known as Olde Estates. It was divided
into 200 building lots, with necessary streets, utilities, and drainage
easements. All lots in Olde Estates were conveyed during 2004, every
deed containing provisions restricting use of the lots to single-family,
one-story residences. Each deed contained the following language:

The restrictions contained herein are binding on the grantee, and his or
her heirs and assigns, and may be enforced by the owner or lawful
occupant of any lot in the Olde Estates development.

The second parcel, known as Olde Heights, remained undeveloped. In
2007, the zoning laws were changed to restrict the use of land in the
areas known as Olde Estates and Olde Heights to residential use for
one-, two-, or three-family dwellings.

The landowner now seeks to develop the parcel known as Olde
Heights as a residential subdivision of 75 lots. She wishes to place
restrictions in the deeds limiting the use of lots in the subdivision to
residential, and she wants to make the restrictions enforceable by
residents of Olde Estates. Under which of the following circumstances
would her scheme be most likely to succeed?

(A) Restrictions in deeds to lots in Olde Heights limit their use to one-,

two-, or three-family dwellings.

(B) Restrictions in deeds to lots in Olde Heights are consented to by all

purchasers of lots contained therein.

(C) All deeds to lots in Olde Heights contain a clause providing that the

804

restrictions contained therein can be enforced by any resident of
either Olde Heights or Olde Estates.

(D) Olde Heights is regarded as a part of a common development

scheme that includes the land known as Olde Estates.

121. On January 1, 2011, a farmer borrowed $15,000 from the bank, signing
a note secured by a mortgage on her farm. The following August 1, the
farmer entered into a valid written contract to sell the farm to the
buyer. The contract contained a provision by which the farmer
promised to deliver title free from encumbrances on or before October
10. On October 10, 2011, the farmer executed and delivered to the
buyer a deed that contained a covenant against encumbrances. On
October 11, 2011, the bank duly recorded its mortgage on the farm. On
October 14, 2011, the buyer recorded her deed.

The farmer did not pay the bank, and two years later, the buyer
conveyed the farm to a developer by a deed dated October 30, 2013,
that contained a covenant against encumbrances. The bank instituted
foreclosure proceedings one month after the developer took title to the
land. The developer satisfied the bank's mortgage on December 10,
2013, by paying the debt contracted by the farmer. The statutory period
of limitations on actions for breach of any covenant contained in a
deed is one year. If the developer instituted an action against the
farmer on December 20, 2013, for breach of the covenant against
encumbrances, which of the following would be the farmer's LEAST
effective argument in defense?

(A) The developer has an adequate remedy against the buyer.

(B) An action for breach of a covenant contained in a deed can be

brought only by the grantee named in that deed.

(C) The developer had constructive notice of the mortgage.

(D) The statute of limitations bars the developer's action against the

farmer.

122. A landowner was the owner of a rectangular 200-acre parcel known as
The Retreat located outside of town. The Retreat was famous as the
most desired property in town. On his son's birthday, the landowner
executed a deed naming his son as grantee, and containing the
following description:

805

Five acres of The Retreat, being those five acres that lie at the
northeast corner of said realty, and constituting a square with its
northernmost and easternmost sides lying on the north and east
boundaries of The Retreat, respectively.

Is the description legally sufficient to result in a conveyance if all
other requirements are found to have been satisfied?

(A) Yes, because it adequately identifies the realty described.

(B) Yes, but all that it can convey is an unidentified fractional portion

of the land known as The Retreat.

(C) No, since it lacks either metes and bounds or reference to existing

government surveys.

(D) No, since a deed cannot convey less than the entire parcel of realty

to which it refers.

123. On May 10, the seller contracted with the buyer for the sale of the

seller's home, title to close on or about July 1. According to the terms
of the contract, the buyer was to move into the house on June 1 and to
pay rent of $350 per month until title closed. The buyer moved in as
planned on June 1. On June 10, the buyer fell asleep while smoking in
bed. His cigarette ignited the bedclothing, causing a fire that severely
damaged the house.

The jurisdiction does not recognize the doctrine of equitable
conversion. Which of the following correctly states the rights of the
buyer and the seller?

(A) The buyer is not required to purchase the property, and the seller
must return any monies already received from the buyer in
connection with the purchase.

(B) The buyer is not required to purchase the property, but the seller
may retain any monies already received from the buyer in
connection with the purchase.

(C) The buyer is required to purchase the property and must pay the full

price agreed upon in the contract of sale.

(D) The buyer is required to purchase the property, but the purchase

price should be abated to the extent of the damage.

124. The landowner was the owner in fee simple of a rectangular parcel of

806

real estate. He subdivided it into two lots and sold one of the lots to
the buyer, keeping the other lot for himself. At the time of the purchase,
the buyer told the landowner about his plans to install a large picture
window. Soon after the sale, the buyer began to install the window. At
the same time, the landowner began construction of a three-story
building on his lot.

In an action by the buyer to enjoin the landowner from completing
construction of the three-story building in such a way as to obstruct the
view from the buyer's picture window, the court should find for

(A) the buyer, because upon purchasing the lot from the landowner, he

received an implied easement for light, air, and view.

(B) the buyer, because he acquired by prescription an easement to an

unobstructed view from the picture window.

(C) the buyer, because he notified the landowner of his intention to

build the picture window at the time of his purchase of the lot from
the landowner.

(D) the landowner.

125. On March 1, the seller and the buyer entered into a valid written
contract for the sale of the seller's home to the buyer at a price of
$180,000, with title to close on June 15. It was further agreed that the
buyer could move into and occupy the premises until title passed, at a
rent of $500 per month to be added onto the purchase price and paid to
the seller at the time of closing. On April 15, before the closing, a fire
completely destroyed the house. The fire was not the result of fault by
either party.

The jurisdiction does not apply the doctrine of equitable conversion.
In litigation between the parties, which of the following additional
facts, if it was the only one true, would be most likely to result in a
finding that the buyer is obligated to purchase the premises at the price
agreed upon in the contract of March 1?

(A) On March 1, the buyer purchased a policy of fire insurance on the
premises that was in force on the day that the house was destroyed
by fire.

(B) In accordance with an agreement between the parties, the buyer

was in possession of the house on the day of the fire.

807

(C) On March 1, it was foreseeable to the parties that fire could

damage the realty prior to the closing of title.

(D) Destruction of the house resulted in a relatively minor reduction in

the value of the realty.

126. The landowner was the owner in fee simple of a parcel of land. On
May 1, the landowner executed a deed that purported to grant an
undivided one-quarter interest in the land to the landowner's nephew.

On May 2, the landowner sent for her nephew. She said, “I was
planning to leave you an interest in the land in my will, but I see no
reason why you should have to pay inheritance tax. So I'll give it to
you while I'm still alive if you promise to move in here with me
sometime during the next year.” The nephew promised that he would
do so, and the landowner gave him the deed, saying, “Then it's yours.”
The nephew read the deed, thanked the landowner, and handed the
deed back to the landowner for safekeeping. The landowner placed it
in a drawer of her desk.

On May 7, the landowner argued with her nephew. Angry, the
landowner tore the deed into eight pieces and returned them to her
desk drawer. On May 10, the landowner died, leaving no will.

In an appropriate proceeding, should a court find that the nephew held
a possessory interest in the land on the landowner's death?

(A) No, because the deed was an attempted testamentary substitute.

(B) No, because the landowner's possession of the deed raises an
irrebuttable presumption that there was no effective delivery.

(C) Yes, because there was an effective conveyance to the nephew on

May 2.

(D) Yes, because the nephew detrimentally relied by promising to move

in with the landowner.

127. The landowner was the owner in fee simple absolute of a tract of land.
On January 10, 2013, the landowner borrowed $20,000 from the bank
and executed a note secured by a mortgage on the land. On April 30,
2013, as a 21st birthday present, the landowner executed a grant deed
conveying the land to his son. The deed made no mention of the
mortgage held by the bank. On May 15, 2013, the bank duly recorded

808

its mortgage. On May 17, 2013, the son duly recorded his deed.
Neither the landowner nor the son ever made any payments to the bank.

The jurisdiction has a statute that provides that “Every conveyance of
an interest in real estate that shall not be recorded shall be void
against any subsequent grantee in good faith of the same real estate or
any portion thereof whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.” If
the bank attempts to foreclose the mortgage, will it succeed?

(A) No, because the bank's mortgage was recorded outside the chain of

title.

(B) No, because the son did not have actual or constructive knowledge
of the bank's interest at the time the land was conveyed to him.

(C) Yes, because the bank's interest was recorded prior to the son's

interest.

(D) Yes, because the son did not give consideration for the conveyance

from the landowner.

128. On April 1, the landowner's grandmother died, leaving a will that

purported to devise to the landowner a 90-acre parcel of realty known
as Southacre and an adjoining 10-acre parcel known as Northacre.

On May 1, the landowner executed a general warranty deed containing
covenants of title and quiet enjoyment, which purported to convey to a
lawyer “a 100-acre tract of land consisting of a 90-acre parcel known
as Southacre and a 10-acre parcel known as Northacre.”

On June 15, the lawyer sold Northacre and Southacre to a doctor,
executing a general warranty deed describing both parcels and
containing covenants of title.

On July 1, the landowner learned that just before her death, his
grandmother had sold Northacre to a builder. Unaware of the lawyer's
conveyance to the doctor, the landowner offered the builder $10,000
to convey Northacre to the lawyer. On July 2, the builder accepted the
landowner's offer and conveyed Northacre to the lawyer by general
warranty deed containing covenants of title.

The doctor institutes an appropriate proceeding for an order declaring
himself to be the owner of Northacre. Which of the following would

809

be the doctor's most effective argument in support of his claim?

(A) The builder's conveyance of Northacre to the lawyer was the result
of an attempt by the landowner to conform the title to the covenant.

(B) The lawyer has an effective remedy against the landowner.

(C) The lawyer's intention was to convey Northacre to the doctor on

July 1.

(D) The lawyer's conveyance to the doctor on June 15 estops the

lawyer from asserting his title to Northacre.

129. The landowner was the owner of Redacre. By a deed dated January 2,
she granted Redacre “to my nephew for life, remainder to my niece,
but if the realty shall ever be used for any purpose other than
residential, to Sunrise Foundation.” Sunrise Foundation is a charitable
organization.

If Sunrise Foundation's interest in Redacre is valid, it is best
described as a

(A) vested remainder subject to divestment.

(B) contingent remainder.

(C) shifting executory interest.

(D) springing executory interest.

130. The landlord leased an office to the tenant for a period of five years by
an agreement that prohibited assignment by the tenant without the
landlord's written permission. Two years after taking occupancy, the
tenant requested the landlord's permission to assign the balance of his
leasehold to a store owner. After checking the store owner's credit, the
landlord wrote the tenant that the assignment was acceptable to him so
long as the store owner personally assumed all obligations of the
lease. The tenant's attorney prepared an agreement by which the tenant
assigned all his rights under the lease to the store owner and the store
owner agreed to personally assume all obligations under the lease.
After the agreement was signed by the tenant and the store owner, the
tenant's attorney sent a copy of it to the landlord. The store owner
moved into the premises and began paying rent to the landlord.

After paying rent for six months, the store owner assigned the balance
of the leasehold to an accountant. The accountant paid rent directly to

810

the landlord for two additional months and then stopped paying rent
and abandoned the premises. In an action by the landlord against the
store owner for unpaid rent, the court should find for

(A) the landlord.

(B) the store owner, because the accountant paid rent directly to the

landlord for two months.

(C) the store owner, because there was no privity of contract between

the landlord and the store owner.

(D) the store owner, because the store owner was only obligated to pay

rent so long as he remained in possession of the premises.

131. By grant deed, a landowner conveyed a parcel of realty “to the Church

of the Lord so long as the property is used for church purposes, but if
the grantee permits the property to be used for any purpose other than a
church purpose, the property shall revert to the grantor.” Two weeks
after receiving title, the Church of the Lord filed an application with
the county Building Department for a permit to construct a house of
worship on the parcel. Prior to issuing the permit, the Building
Department published notice of the church's application as required by
state law. Upon seeing the notice, a homeowner who owned an
adjacent parcel advised church officials that he had been driving
across the parcel to gain access to his land for more than 30 years. He
claimed that he had thus acquired an easement by prescription and
threatened to commence an action to quiet title to the realty for the
purpose of having his easement judicially recognized. The county
Building Department informed officials of the Church of the Lord that
no building permit could be issued while an action to quiet title was
pending. Because it could take several years for such an action to
reach conclusion, and because the easement claimed by the
homeowner would not significantly interfere with building plans, the
church attorney advised granting him the easement that he claimed to
hold. Church officials subsequently executed a deed granting the
homeowner the easement that he claimed.

On the day after the Church of the Lord granted an easement to the
homeowner, the landowner asserted that the homeowner's use of the
premises was other than for church purposes and instituted an action
for an order declaring that he was the owner of the realty. Which of the
following would be the Church of the Lord's most effective argument

811

in opposition to the landowner's claim?

(A) The Church of the Lord acted in good faith on the advice of its

attorney.

(B) The language of the deed created a fee simple determinable.

(C) The homeowner's easement preexisted the landowner's grant to the

Church of the Lord.

(D) The landowner's interest violated the Rule Against Perpetuities.

132. When the homeowner purchased her home, she borrowed part of the

purchase price from a bank. Simultaneously with receipt of title to the
realty, she executed a note payable to the bank and secured by a
mortgage on the realty. Subsequently, the homeowner sold the realty to
the first buyer, who took it subject to the mortgage and assumed the
mortgage. Two years later, the first buyer sold the property to the
second buyer, who also took it subject to the mortgage and assumed the
mortgage. The following year, the second buyer sold the property to
the third buyer, who took it subject to the mortgage but did not assume
the mortgage.

For two years, the third buyer made payments on the note to the bank.
Then, because of changes in the area, the property decreased sharply
in value, and the third buyer stopped making payments.

The mortgage executed by the homeowner contained a clause that
specifically permitted buyers of the premises to take them “subject to
the mortgage” and/or to “assume the mortgage.” If the bank sues the
homeowner, the first buyer, and the second buyer on the note, from
which of them is it entitled to recover?

(A) The homeowner only.

(B) The second buyer only.

(C) The homeowner and the second buyer only.

(D) The homeowner, the first buyer, and the second buyer.

133. The landowner was the owner of a 200-acre parcel of realty known as
Westacre. Because he knew that he was dying, the landowner executed
a deed purporting to convey a portion of Westacre to his sister, who
lived in another state. The deed described the realty conveyed as “A
portion of Westacre 200 feet by 200 feet in size, with its northeastern

812

corner located at the eastern end of the northern border of Westacre.”
Westacre was a famous piece of property, with a giant plastic lobster
at the eastern end of its northern border. There were no government
survey markers in the area.

If the deed were enforceable in all other respects, would the
description that it contains be sufficient to effect a conveyance?

(A) No, because it does not set forth metes and bounds.

(B) Yes, because there is an artificial monument at the eastern end of

the northern border of Westacre.

(C) Yes, because it identifies the realty conveyed with reasonable

clarity.

(D) Yes, because there are no government survey markers in the area.

134. A man purchased a home from a development company. The deed from

the development company stated that the man would have the right to
use a small private neighborhood beach near the property that the
development company had built to attract buyers to the neighborhood.
However, the deed did not state whether these beach rights were
transferable. Twenty-one years later, the man sold the home to a
woman. By then, the development company had sold the beach to a
nearby golf course. When the woman went to use the beach, the golf
course kicked her off. The woman brought suit to enforce the beach
rights included in the deed. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the woman, because she gained use of the beach by adverse

possession.

(B) the woman, because the deed created an easement appurtenant.

(C) the golf course, because it did not create the original deed.

(D) the golf course, because the deed did not say whether the beach

rights were transferable.

135. The landowner is the owner of a hillside parcel of realty known as

Slopeacre, on which he grows oranges for sale to a company that
makes juice from them. For several years, the landowner has been
irrigating his orange trees with water from a stream that flows across
Slopeacre. After flowing across Slopeacre, the stream flows through
Flatacre, a parcel of realty located in the valley below Slopeacre. A
homeowner, who owns Flatacre, lives there with his family. The

813

homeowner's family uses water from the stream for household
purposes.

The jurisdiction determines water rights by applying riparian law.

Because of a drought, there was enough water in the stream to satisfy
the needs of either Flatacre or Slopeacre, but not both. There were no
other riparian owners. Who is entitled to use the water?

(A) The landowner, because he is the upstream owner.

(B) The landowner, because he needs the water for agricultural use.

(C) The homeowner, because he needs the water for household use.

(D) The homeowner, because he is the downstream owner.

136. A farmer was the owner of a large tract of land on which he grew

crops. Because his income was declining, he decided to subdivide and
sell his land. With government approval, he platted a subdivision
consisting of 50 parcels of land with necessary access and utility
easements. Soon afterwards, he conveyed one of the parcels to the first
buyer by a properly recorded deed that they both signed and that
contained the following language:

The  parties  hereto  hereby  covenant  for  themselves,  their  heirs,
successors,  and  assigns,  that  the  realty  herein  conveyed  shall  not  be
used  for  any  purpose  other  than  residential,  and  that  all  conveyances
of realty in the subdivision shall contain this covenant.

The first buyer subsequently sold half of his parcel to the second
buyer, conveying it by a deed that contained no covenants or
restrictions. Six months later, because he was unable to sell any of the
other parcels, the farmer resumed agricultural activities on his
remaining land. At the same time, the second buyer began construction
of a gas station on the realty that he had purchased from the first buyer.

The farmer commenced a proceeding to prevent the second buyer from
constructing a gas station on the realty. Should the court grant the relief
requested by the farmer?

(A) No, because the farmer did not sell any of the other land in the

subdivision.

(B) No, because the second buyer did not agree to refrain from non-

814

residential use of the land.

(C) Yes, because the covenant in the farmer's deed to the first buyer ran

with the land.

(D) Yes, because the construction of a gas station by the second buyer

was likely to inhibit sale of the remaining parcels in the
subdivision.

137. The landlord, who was the owner of a commercial office building,

leased an office in the building to the first lessee pursuant to a 10-year
lease calling for rent in the sum of $1,000 per month. The first lessee
occupied the premises for a period of two years, paying the rent as it
became due each month. At the end of that period, he assigned the
balance of the leasehold to the second lessee by a document in which
the second lessee agreed to be personally liable for all obligations
under the lease and which was signed by the first lessee and the
second lessee. Immediately following execution of the assignment, the
first lessee sent a copy of it to the landlord. The second lessee
occupied the premises for several years, paying the rent as it came
due. When seven months of the lease period remained, the second
lessee assigned the balance of the leasehold to the third lessee. The
third lessee did not agree to be personally liable for all obligations
under the lease, and the landlord was not informed of the assignment.
The third lessee occupied the premises for two months but did not pay
rent. At the end of that period, the third lessee assigned the balance of
the lease to the fourth lessee. The fourth lessee occupied the premises
for five months without paying rent, abandoning the premises when the
lease expired. When the premises were vacated, a total of seven
months' rent remained unpaid.

The landlord asserts a claim against the third lessee for unpaid rent.
The court should award judgment for the landlord in the sum of

(A) nothing, since the third lessee did not agree to be personally liable.

(B) $2,000, since the third lessee and the landlord are not in privity of

contract.

(C) $2,000, the amount of rent that remains unpaid for the period during

which the third lessee occupied the premises.

(D) $7,000, the amount of rent that remains unpaid for the period during
which the third lessee and his assignee, the fourth lessee, occupied

815

the premises.

138. A woman leased a parcel of land from a landlord for one year. The
rent was $1,000 a month, with an option to buy at lease termination.
While living on the property, the woman erected a small garage. The
garage cost $2,000 to build, but was worth $3,000 when it was
completed. The woman vacated the property three months before the
expiration of the lease, telling the landlord she would not exercise her
purchase option. On the same day, the landlord conveyed the property
to a developer, although the property remained vacant for the
remainder of the lease term.

The landlord sued the woman for $3,000 in unpaid rent. How should
the court rule?

(A) The woman owes the landlord $3,000.

(B) The woman owes the landlord $1,000, because the cost of the

garage was $2,000.

(C) The woman does not owe the landlord anything, because he

conveyed the property to the developer the day the woman left.

(D) The woman does not owe the landlord anything, because the garage

she built is worth $3,000.

139. A buyer put down a deposit in order to buy several acres of forested
land from a landowner. The contract provided that the landowner
would deliver marketable title. Prior to closing, the buyer discovered
a man had built a cabin on the land without the landowner's permission
or knowledge. It was unclear how long the man had been on the land.
On the day of closing, the buyer refused to accept the deed on the
ground that the landowner's title was not marketable and demanded his
deposit back. The landowner refused to return the deposit but offered
to furnish the buyer with title insurance that specifically insured
against adverse possession claims. If the buyer sues the landowner,
who is most likely to win?

(A) The buyer, because the man may have acquired title by adverse

possession.

(B) The buyer, because there is no indication the deed has been

recorded.

(C) The landowner, because he is willing to provide title insurance to

816

the buyer.

(D) The landowner, because the man may not have a valid claim for

adverse possession.

140. The landowner conveyed a parcel of realty “to my friend and his heirs,
so long as liquor is not sold on the premises, but if liquor is sold on
the premises, then to the Foundation for Heart Diseases.” The
Foundation for Heart Diseases was a charity. Two years later, the
friend began selling liquor on the premises.

Which of the following best describes the interest of the Foundation
for Heart Diseases in the realty on the day after the friend began
selling liquor on the premises?

(A) Fee simple absolute, because the Foundation for Heart Diseases is

a charity.

(B) Right of reentry.

(C) No interest, since at the time of the conveyance, it was possible that
the interest that the deed purported to grant to the foundation would
not vest within a period measured by a life or lives in being plus
21 years.

(D) Valid shifting executory interest.

141. A landowner allowed an artist to live on her land for free. The artist

built a large machine on the property that was used to excavate and
carve stones removed from the landowner's land for the artist's work.
The machine weighed two tons and was the size of a small garage. Ten
years later, the landowner sold the land to a buyer. The sales contract
referred to the subject of sale as “all the realty located at . . . ”
followed by a metes and bounds description. Prior to closing, the artist
removed the machine. The buyer discovered the machine was removed
and demanded that the selling price of the realty be abated. The artist
told the buyer she never intended the machine to become part of the
property, and the landowner concurred that she never considered the
machine part of the property. The jurisdiction's applicable statute
provides that if part of the realty that is subject to the sales contract is
removed or destroyed, the buyer may elect to take title subject to the
appropriate abatement of the purchase price.

Should the selling price be abated?

817

(A) Yes, because the contract referred to “all the realty.”

(B) Yes, because the size and purpose of the machine made it a fixture.

(C) No, because the artist did not intend for the machine to become a

fixture.

(D) No, because the machine was not fastened to the ground.

142. When the landowner died, he was the owner of 200 acres of

undeveloped land. His will devised the land to his three daughters as
joint tenants with right of survivorship. All three of them lived in a
distant state, but after the landowner's death, the youngest daughter
moved onto the land and began cultivating it. She grew grain and
beans, realizing substantial profits from these farming activities almost
immediately.

The land had a reasonable rental value of $12,000 per year. After the
youngest daughter began realizing a profit from her farming enterprise,
the eldest daughter asserted a claim against the youngest daughter for
$4,000 per year, equivalent to one-third of the reasonable rental value.
Which of the following facts or inferences, if it were the only one true,
would be most likely to result in a judgment for the eldest daughter?

(A) Farming was the best and highest use of the land.

(B) A real estate developer had offered to purchase the land for
substantially more than its reasonable market value, but the
youngest daughter refused to sell her interest.

(C) The eldest daughter had attempted to move onto the land, but the

youngest daughter prevented her from doing so.

(D) The youngest daughter erected permanent structures on the land that

she occupied for residential and agricultural purposes.

143. In January, a farmer sold a large tract of land to a developer for

$100,000. The developer paid $50,000 when he received the deed,
and executed a note for the balance secured by a mortgage on the land.
Neither the deed nor the mortgage was recorded. The developer failed
to make any of the required mortgage payments. In March, the farmer
purported to sell the land to a builder for $100,000. In April, after the
farmer contacted the developer regarding the missing mortgage
payments, the developer reconveyed the title back to the farmer. In
June, the builder learned of the earlier land sale and the reconveyance

818

to the farmer.

If the builder brings an action against the farmer to quiet title, the court
should rule in favor of

(A) the farmer, because he did not hold title to the land when he made

the sale to the builder.

(B) the farmer, because there is no indication the builder recorded the

farmer's deed to him.

(C) the builder, because the farmer's sale to the builder was fraudulent.

(D) the builder, because the farmer is estopped from denying the

builder's title.

144. A landowner owned a large tract of undeveloped land. In 1995, a man

built a cabin on the landowner's land without the landowner's
knowledge. Five years later, in June 2000, the landowner discovered
the man's presence and forced him to move away. A month later, the
man moved back to the cabin without the landowner's knowledge. The
man remained in possession for another 16 years. In 2016, the
landowner discovered the man again and filed an action to eject him.
The relevant statutory period for acquiring title by adverse possession
is 20 years.

The court should find for

(A) the landowner, because the landowner removed the man in June

2000.

(B) the landowner, because the landowner did not give the man

permission to return.

(C) the man, because there was no indication he was removed in June

2000 by a court order.

(D) the man, because his removal in June 2000 was only temporary.

ANSWERS TO 
PROPERTY QUESTIONS

1. B Under common law, a conveyance of real estate is not valid unless it
identifies  the  grantor,  the  grantee,  and  the  property  conveyed.  The
statute simply codified this rule. Realty cannot be conveyed by the use
of  negotiable  paper  (i.e.,  to  bearer).  For  this  reason,  the  document
conveyed no interest.

A  is  incorrect  because  even  an  unrecordable  deed  may  affect  the
rights of grantor and grantee as against each other. C is incorrect for
two  reasons:  First,  consideration  is  not  required  to  make  a  deed
effective,  and  second,  courts  do  not  generally  inquire  into  the
adequacy of consideration. Although a claim of economic duress has
occasionally been used to avoid the legal effect of documents that are
otherwise valid, it is not applied consistently enough to make D the
correct answer, and it is not applied unless the duress was created by
the party against whom it is asserted.

2.  D  So  long  as  the  adverse  possessor  has  remained  openly,  notoriously,
hostilely, and continuously in possession for the statutory period, he or
she  may  acquire  title  to  the  land  even  though  it  changed  ownership
during the period of his or her adverse possession. Thus, the fact that
the neighbor bought the land from a prior owner during the period of
the farmer's possession would not result in a judgment for the neighbor.

Possession  of  realty  is  hostile  if  it  is  contrary  to  the  rights  of  the
owner. Since occupying realty that has been rented from the owner is
not  contrary  to  his  or  her  rights,  the  payment  of  rent  would  have
prevented the farmer's possession from being hostile. Since a dozen
eggs  per  week  could  be  construed  as  rent,  A  might  result  in  a
judgment for the neighbor and is therefore incorrect. Permission from
the  owner  of  the  neighbor's  land  would  have  had  the  same  effect,
making  B  incorrect.  If  the  farmer  said  that  he  would  remove  the
chicken  coop  whenever  the  owner  of  the  neighbor's  land  asked  him
to, and the owner of the neighbor's land did not, it might likewise be
concluded that the chicken coop remained by permission of the owner
of  the  neighbor's  land.  The  farmer's  possession  would  not  therefore
be hostile, making C incorrect.

3. D  An  easement  by  prescription  is  an  easement  that  is  gained  under  the

821

principles  of  adverse  possession.  Consequently,  a  person  who  uses
another's  land  for  more  than  the  applicable  statutory  period,  gains  an
easement by prescription. However, in order to gain such an easement,
the use must be without the servient land holder's permission, and the
use must be continuous and uninterrupted through the statutory period.
Different landholder's uses can be tacked together to reach the required
number of years in the statutory period. However, in the case where a
dominant tenement comes to be owned by the same person who owns
the servient tenement, even if the tenant on the dominant property uses
the easement, this use will not be hostile, and the requisite hostile use
will  therefore  be  interrupted.  Here,  during  the  one-year  period  when
the  landowner  owned  Whiteacre  (the  dominant  parcel),  the  doctor's
use was not hostile since it will be deemed to be with the permission
of the landowner, who is now the doctor's landlord. Therefore,  there
will be not tacking from the doctor to the landowner to the dentist, and
the dentist will not have completed the 10-year statutory period. A and
B are therefore incorrect.

An  easement  by  estoppel  is  created  when  one  landowner  allows
another  to  use  his  or  her  land  under  circumstances  where  the
landowner  should  reasonably  foresee  that  the  other  landowner  will
substantially  change  position  believing  this  permission  will  not  be
revoked, and the other landowner does in fact change position. Here,
there is no indication that the doctor or dentist did so. C is therefore
incorrect.

4. D A deed is effective upon delivery to and acceptance by the grantee or
the  grantee's  agent.  Delivery  of  a  deed  to  one  co-tenant  is  usually
viewed as delivery to all co-tenants. Thus, the delivery to the younger
son  was  a  delivery  to  the  older  son  as  well.  If  a  conveyance  is
beneficial to a named grantee, acceptance by that grantee is presumed.
Since the transfer was beneficial to the older son, it is presumed that
the older son accepted delivery of the deed. These facts, coupled with
recording  by  the  older  son's  co-tenant,  are  sufficient  to  result  in  an
effective  conveyance  to  the  older  son  of  a  joint  tenancy  in  the  land.
Since  joint  tenants  have  the  right  of  survivorship,  the  younger  son's
interest passed to the older son upon the younger son's death.

A is incorrect because the delivery to the younger son was a delivery
to  his  co-tenant  as  well,  and  because  the  older  son's  right  of
survivorship made the younger son's devise to the friend ineffective.

822

A  testamentary  disposition  is  a  transfer  made  by  will.  Since  the
landowner  conveyed  the  realty  inter  vivos  (i.e.,  while  alive),  B  is
incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  occupancy  by  a  grantee  is  not
necessary  to  make  the  grant  effective,  and  because  the  conveyance
was effective upon delivery and acceptance of the deed and was not
undone  by  the  grantee's  return  of  the  deed  to  the  grantor  for
safekeeping.

5. C Unless a deed is signed by the grantor or the grantor's agent, it does not

effectively convey an interest in realty.

A gift is a transfer without consideration. A is incorrect because an
interest in realty may be conveyed as a gift and such a conveyance is
valid  even  though  no  consideration  was  given  for  it.  B  is  incorrect
because  a  deed  that  is  silent  as  to  the  interest  being  conveyed  is
presumed to convey whatever interest the grantor holds. Recording a
deed gives the world constructive notice of the grantee's interest but
does  not  affect  the  validity  of  the  deed.  D  is  incorrect  because  an
unrecorded deed is effective at least against the grantor.

6. D  Under  the  doctrine  of  equitable  conversion,  the  risk  of  loss  of  realty
passes  to  the  buyer  as  soon  as  a  contract  of  sale  is  executed.  In
jurisdictions  that  have  rejected  the  doctrine  of  equitable  conversion,
the risk of loss of realty subject to a contract for sale remains with the
seller until the transfer of either title or possession to the buyer. Most
jurisdictions agree, however, that if destruction of an immaterial part
of  the  realty  occurs  prior  to  that  time,  the  seller  may  enforce  the
contract after the price is abated to account for the damage. Since the
facts make it clear that the sheds were inconsequential and that the real
estate investor intended to demolish them after taking title to the realty,
they may be regarded as immaterial parts of the realty.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  sheds  were  not
material  parts  of  the  realty.  In  jurisdictions  that  have  rejected  the
doctrine of equitable conversion, C is an inaccurate statement of the
law.

7. C  A  license  is  a  right  to  use  the  licensor's  land  that  is  revocable  at  the
will of the licensor. However, a license is irrevocable if its use would
have been an easement except for failure to meet the Statute of Frauds,
and the licensee makes substantial expenditures on the land in reliance
on the licensor's promise that the license will be permanent or of long

823

duration. Here, the license, although oral, was irrevocable because of
the  defendant's  substantial  reliance  expenditures.  A  is  therefore
incorrect.

A license is not required to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, so it can be
created  orally.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Easements  must  meet  the
Statute  of  Frauds,  so  they  cannot  be  created  orally.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

8. C Ordinarily, restrictions contained in a conveyance cannot be enforced
to  benefit  realty  in  which  the  grantor  has  no  interest.  Since  the
developer had already conveyed Lot 1, he had no interest in it when he
conveyed  Lot  25  to  the  second  buyer.  For  this  reason,  restrictions
contained in the deed for Lot 25 cannot be enforced for the benefit of
Lot 1. An exception is sometimes made in the case of a subdivision if
it  can  be  shown  that  a  prior  purchaser  bought  in  reliance  on
restrictions  to  be  contained  in  deeds  to  subsequent  purchasers.  Since
there is no indication that the first buyer was aware that the deed to Lot
25 would contain a restriction, however, he could not have relied on it
when purchasing Lot 1 and cannot enforce it. C is therefore correct.

though 

the  deed  by  which 

A  is  incorrect  because  a  restriction  may  be  enforced  against  a
covenantor's  successor,  even 
the
covenantor  conveyed  to  his  successor  did  not  mention  it.  Thus,  the
fact  that  the  third  buyer's  deed  did  not  mention  the  restriction  is  not
sufficient  to  prevent  the  issuance  of  the  injunction.  B  is  incorrect
because,  as  explained  above,  if  the  first  buyer  knew  that  the
restriction would be contained in the deed to Lot 25 and relied upon
that  restriction,  he  may  have  acquired  the  right  to  enforce  it  even
though it was not mentioned in his deed. A covenant is said to “touch
and concern” the burdened land if only the possessor of that land may
perform it, and it is said to “touch and concern” the benefitted land if
the resulting benefit is tied to possession of that land. Since only the
possessor  of  Lot  25  can  comply  with  the  use  restriction,  it  touches
and concerns Lot 25. Since Lot 1 is in close physical proximity and in
full view of Lot 25, its value will be affected by the use to which Lot
25 is put. The restriction, therefore, touches and concerns Lot 1. For
these reasons, D is incorrect.

9. A The ex-husband may convey the interest that he holds. Since his interest

is a life estate, A is correct.

824

Since the ex-wife or the buyer might outlive the ex-husband, B and C
are incorrect. Since life estates are alienable, D is also incorrect.

10.  A  An  easement  by  express  reservation  is  one  for  the  benefit  of  the
grantor  that  he  or  she  creates  by  language  contained  in  the  deed  by
which he or she conveys the servient estate. It does not terminate with
non-use  unless  there  is  a  clear  manifestation  of  the  intention  to
abandon  it  by  the  easement-holder.  The  landowner's  maintenance  of
the right of way across Lot 1 indicates that it was not his intention to
abandon it.

An implied easement by necessity terminates when the strict necessity
ceases  to  exist.  B  and  C  are  both  incorrect,  however,  because  the
easement across Lot 1 was by express reservation. The existence of
an easement generally does diminish the value of the servient estate.
D is incorrect because this reduction in value, even if unreasonable,
is not in itself sufficient to invalidate the easement.

11. D The landowner's will did not speak until the landowner's death, and it
devised an interest in the realty only to those children who survived
the  landowner.  Since  the  son  predeceased  the  landowner,  the  son
never received an interest in the realty; his purported mortgage to the
financial institution did not give the financial institution any interest.
For  this  reason,  the  landowner's  interest  was  unaffected  by  the
mortgage and was absolute. As the landowner's only surviving child,
the  daughter  received  the  landowner's  interest  upon  the  landowner's
death.

Since the financial institution held no interest in the realty, A, B, and
C are incorrect.

12. B The woman has given her husband a power of appointment. A power
of appointment is the legal right to designate subsequent transferees of
realty. It may be exercised only in the manner specified by the donor
of the power. If the donee of the power fails to exercise it, the realty
subject to the power of appointment reverts to the estate of the donor.
Since the woman specified that her husband's power of appointment
could  be  exercised  only  by  will,  and  since  her  husband  failed  to
exercise  it  by  his  will,  the  land  reverted  to  the  estate  of  the  woman
upon  her  husband's  death.  Marketable  title  is  title  that  is  free  from
claims  that  would  lead  a  reasonable  person  to  doubt  its  validity.
Since the realty reverted to the woman's estate, the second wife had

825

no interest in it subsequent to the death of the husband. Her inability
to deliver marketable title is a breach of her contract with the buyer,
entitling the buyer to the relief that he seeks.

Covenants for title in the deed might have given the buyer a lawsuit
against the second wife if the title that the deed purported to convey
proved  to  be  defective,  but  they  would  not  have  made  the  title
marketable. A is therefore incorrect. Since the woman specified that
her husband's power could be exercised only by will, his inter vivos
conveyance  to  the  second  wife  was  without  effect.  C  is  therefore
incorrect. The land did not pass to her husband's heirs under the laws
of  intestacy  because  her  husband's  failure  to  exercise  the  power  by
will resulted in reversion of the land to the estate of the woman. D is
therefore incorrect.

13. B A reversion is a future interest of the grantor that will automatically
follow a prior estate that will inevitably terminate (e.g., a life estate;
a  leasehold).  A  possibility  of  reverter  is  a  future  interest  of  the
grantor  that  will  automatically  follow  a  prior  estate  that  will  not
inevitably terminate (e.g., fee simple determinable). A right of reentry
is a future interest of the grantor that does not revert automatically but
which requires some act by the grantor for him or her to reacquire a
possessory right and which follows an estate that will not inevitably
terminate. Since the property was conveyed only for so long as it is
used  as  a  home  for  the  elderly,  it  will  automatically  revert  to  the
grantor if that use is ever discontinued. It is thus either a reversion or
a possibility of reverter. Since it is not certain that it ever will cease
to be used as a home for the elderly, however, the prior estate is not
one  that  will  inevitably  terminate.  For  this  reason,  the  grantor's
interest is a possibility of reverter.

A is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because if the property ever
ceases to be used as a home for the elderly, no act of the grantor is
necessary to make his interest possessory. D is incorrect because the
Rule Against Perpetuities does not apply to a grantor's interest.

14.  B  A  life  tenant  is  required  to  pay  real  estate  taxes  that  become  due
during the term of her life tenancy. Although a life tenant is required
to  pay  interest  on  outstanding  encumbrances,  the  remainderman  is
under an obligation to pay principal.

A is incorrect because as life tenant, the wife should not be required

826

to  pay  principal.  C  is  incorrect  for  this  reason,  and  because  as
remainderman,  the  brother  should  not  be  required  to  pay  the  real
estate taxes. D is incorrect for the latter reason.

15. A Acquisition of title by adverse possession results from application of
a statute of limitations that prevents the record owner from enforcing
any rights that he or she might have against the adverse possessor. For
this reason, the period does not begin to run until a cause of action by
the record owner accrues. Thus, it does not begin running against an
infant  owner  until  he  or  she  achieves  majority;  it  does  not  begin
running against a remainderman until the preceding estate terminates.
(Note:  If  the  realty  was  held  in  fee  simple  when  the  period  of
adverse  possession  began,  it  may  continue  in  spite  of  changes  in
ownership  of  the  fee.)  Until  the  nephew's  estate  terminated,  the  son
had  no  right  to  sue  the  hunter,  although  he  did  have  an  ownership
interest in the land at the time the hunter moved onto the land.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  son's  right  was  not  possessory  until  the
termination of the nephew's estate. C is incorrect because even after
achieving  majority  (c.1994),  the  son's  interest  in  the  realty  was  not
possessory.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  hunter's  period  of  adverse
possession  against  the  son  did  not  begin  until  the  son's  interest
became  possessory.  Another  way  of  looking  at  the  problem  is  to
recognize that the adverse possessor acquires no greater interest than
is held by the person against whom his or her possession is adverse.
Thus, the hunter's possession during the nephew's term could not have
resulted  in  more  than  his  acquisition  of  a  20-year  term  (i.e.,  the
nephew's interest) by adverse possession.

16.  D  A  mortgage  is  a  financing  arrangement  where  the  person  buying
property (or one who already owns property) receives a loan and the
property  is  pledged  as  security  to  guarantee  repayment  of  the  loan.
Importantly,  a  person  may  grant  a  mortgage  on  his  or  her  own
property to secure payment of someone else's debt. Consequently, the
mortgagor  does  not  need  to  receive  any  direct  benefit  for  granting  a
mortgage. Here, the mortgage is valid. Therefore, if the man does not
pay,  the  bank  can  sue  the  man  for  the  balance,  and  if  the  man  is
judgment proof or pays only some of the debt, the bank can foreclose
on the house and have it sold at auction to satisfy the man's debt. This
is so even though the man's father did not sign any underlying note or
make  a  personal  guarantee  of  repayment,  and  even  though  the  man's

827

father received no direct personal benefit from granting the mortgage.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

17. B A co-tenant may occupy the entire premises, subject only to the other
co-tenant's  right  to  do  so  as  well.  If  the  occupying  tenant  does  not
exclude the other co-tenant from the property, the occupying tenant has
no duty to pay the non-occupying co-tenant rent. Here, the brother and
sister share in the property equally, so they are co-tenants. Since the
sister said the brother was welcome to live with her, he has not been
excluded  from  the  property  and  she  does  not  owe  him  any  rent.
Therefore, C and D are incorrect. A is incorrect because the analysis
of this question does not depend on the language used in the father's
will.

18.  C  When  a  deed  is  deposited  with  a  commercial  escrow  agent  with
instructions  to  deliver  it  to  the  grantee  upon  the  happening  of  a
condition outside the grantor's control, title passes automatically upon
the  happening  of  the  specified  condition.  The  buyer  thus  owned  the
realty as soon as his check cleared on January 15, and he is not guilty
of violating the statute.

A and B are therefore incorrect. In some jurisdictions, the risk of loss
passes to the buyer upon execution of a contract for the sale of realty.
D is incorrect, however, because the passage of title does not relate
back to the execution of the contract.

19. A Whether they apply the doctrine of equitable conversion, the Uniform
Vendor  and  Purchaser  Risk  Act,  or  some  other  system  for
apportioning the risk of loss under a real estate sales contract, most
jurisdictions agree that the risk of loss from causes other than the fault
of the vendor passes to the vendee when he or she takes possession of
the realty prior to closing. Although a small minority of jurisdictions
disagree, A is the only argument listed that could possibly support the
man's position.

B and C  are  incorrect  because  passage  of  the  risk  of  loss  does  not
depend  on  the  purchase  of  fire  insurance  by  either  party.  D  is
incorrect because no jurisdiction recognizes such a presumption.

20. A No reason appears in the fact situation why the contract between the
developer and the homeowner is not enforceable. Since the contract
contains  the  homeowner's  promise  to  purchase  water  from  the

828

developer,  he  will  be  liable  to  the  developer  for  damages  resulting
from his breach.

B is incorrect because there is no discrepancy between the contract
and the deed, and because — at least in determining what estate the
grantee has received — discrepancies between a deed and a contract
for sale are resolved by looking to the deed. Since only the possessor
of the land on which the well and water-purifying plant were located
could benefit from the covenant to purchase water, and since only the
possessor of the land granted by the developer could comply with it,
both  the  benefit  and  the  burden  resulting  from  the  covenant  touched
and  concerned  the  land.  Although  this  is  not  relevant  to  the
homeowner's  obligations  under  the  contract,  the  inaccuracy  of  the
statements makes C incorrect. D is incorrect for two reasons: First,
acceptance of a deed containing restrictions may bind the grantee to
those  restrictions  even  though  he  or  she  did  not  sign  the  deed,  and
second,  the  homeowner  agreed  to  purchase  water  in  the  contract  of
sale.

21. B The holder of an easement may not use it in a way that goes beyond
the  scope  of  use  contemplated  at  the  time  of  its  creation.  Since  the
easement across Lot 1 was created for ingress and egress to Lot 2, its
use  for  the  purpose  of  erecting  poles  and  stringing  power  lines
exceeds its scope.

A  is  incorrect  because  an  appurtenant  easement  is  ordinarily
transferred  by  conveyance  of  the  dominant  estate  and  is  therefore
alienable. In addition to the fact that calling an easement “divisible”
says  nothing  about  it,  C  is  incorrect  because  the  stringing  of  wires
was  not  incidental  to  the  contemplated  use  of  the  ingress-egress
easement. An easement is appurtenant if it is designed to benefit the
holder  of  a  particular  piece  of  realty.  An  easement  in  gross  is  not
designed  to  benefit  the  holder  of  a  particular  piece  of  realty.  Since
this  easement  was  for  access  to  Lot  2,  it  was  appurtenant.  D  is
incorrect  because  it  is  a  meaningless  and  incorrect  statement  of  the
law.

22.  B  A  tenancy  with  no  fixed  duration  is  a  tenancy  at  will  and  can  be
terminated  by  either  party.  Since  the  mayor's  authorization  did  not
specify  a  duration,  it  created  a  tenancy  at  will.  Since  the  city  can
terminate  the  occupancy,  it  has  the  right  to  prevent  occupancy  other
than  under  conditions  that  it  sets,  and,  therefore,  to  obtain  an

829

injunction against violations of those conditions.

Since the ballet company's agreement with the city did not obligate it
to pay rent, its non-payment of rent is not a breach that would give the
city  any  rights  that  it  would  not  have  had  otherwise.  A  is  therefore
incorrect. C  is  incorrect  because  a  tenant  at  sufferance  is  one  who
entered  under  a  valid  lease  that  has  since  expired  or  terminated.
Ameliorating waste is the name given to substantial alterations made
by the tenant of leased premises that do not diminish the value of the
real  estate.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  that  there  was  no  lease
probably makes the term inappropriate, because there is no indication
that the proposed changes would not diminish the value of the realty
and  because  courts  are  not  always  willing  to  enjoin  ameliorating
waste.

23.  B  A  tenant's  violation  of  a  lease  provision  prohibiting  sublet  or
assignment of a leasehold is usually regarded as a breach of covenant
for which the tenant may be liable for damages. Because courts favor
the  alienability  of  estates  in  land,  however,  the  violation  does  not
ordinarily result in a finding that the assignment or sublease is void. A
lease may expressly reserve the landlord's right to terminate the lease
if the covenant against alienation is breached. If so, the landlord may
elect  to  evict  the  subtenant  or  assignee  as  a  holdover.  The  landlord
may not elect to terminate the lease and evict the sublessor, however,
because  the  lease  between  the  landlord  and  the  tenant  did  not
expressly reserve that right.

24. C Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must
vest,  if  at  all,  during  a  period  measured  by  lives  in  being  plus  21
years. Since the baby's marriage might have taken place more than 21
years  after  the  deaths  of  the  landowner's  three  children,  her  interest
might  not  have  vested  until  after  the  period  prescribed  by  the  Rule
expired, and thus violates the Rule.

A and B are incorrect because the interest might have vested after the
period expired; the fact that it actually did not does not make it valid.
The birth of other grandchildren would not affect the interests of the
baby since the will provided that the share of a prematurely deceased
child should be divided among issue of that child, and the youngest
daughter could not possibly have any children after her own death. D
is therefore incorrect.

830

25. B If a gift is made to a class of persons, some of whom are in being and
ascertained  at  the  time  the  gift  is  made,  the  class  opens  and  closes
immediately. Since the gift was made in the woman's will, it became
effective at her death. Since some of her husband's children were in
being and ascertained at that time, the class closed immediately.

A is incorrect because, as explained above, the class closed upon the
death of the woman. An interest is contingent if its vesting is subject
to a condition precedent. The child's right to take a share of the realty
does  not  depend  on  the  happening  of  a  condition  precedent,  so  it  is
not  contingent.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
class closed immediately upon the death of the woman, and because
even if it had not, the child's right would be vested subject to partial
divestment and therefore not void.

26. D  An  easement  by  express  grant  does  not  terminate  by  non-use  unless
there  is  a  clearly  manifested  intent  to  abandon  it.  Since  there  is
nothing to indicate that the city intended to abandon the right to empty
water into the creek that crossed the landowner's land, it may exercise
that right even though it has not done so for 40 years.

A private nuisance is a tortious interference with the plaintiff's right
to  use  and  enjoy  realty.  Since  the  easement  privileged  the  city  to
dump water into the creek, its conduct in doing so is not a violation of
any  right  held  by  the  landowner.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is
incorrect because there was no manifestation of an intent to abandon
the easement. C is a fabrication that has no meaning at all.

27. C A tenancy at sufferance happens when a tenant holds over at the end of
a valid lease. Specifically, the tenant must have entered the property
legally,  the  tenant's  right  to  possession  must  have  ended,  and  the
tenant  must  have  remained  without  the  owner's  consent.  When  a
tenancy at sufferance comes into existence, the landlord has the right
of  election  between  evicting  the  tenant  and  holding  the  tenant  to
another term as tenant. The election to keep a tenant may be express
or  implied.  Importantly,  a  landlord  will  be  found  to  elect  a  tenancy
renewal when the landlord accepts rent for the new period or gives
some  affirmative  sign  that  he  or  she  is  regarding  the  lease  as
continuing  for  a  new  period.  However,  the  mere  fact  that  the  tenant
tenders  a  rent  check,  without  any  affirmative  act  by  the  landlord,
won't cause such an election. Consequently, the landlord has the right
to evict the tenant immediately. A and B are therefore incorrect.

831

Constructive  eviction  is  used  where  the  landlord  has  an  obligation
and  continually  breaches  that  obligation  in  a  way  that  makes  the
premises  virtually  uninhabitable  for  the  intended  use.  There  is  no
indication of this in the fact pattern. D is therefore incorrect.

28. B In the absence of language to the contrary, a contract for the sale of
realty  is  presumed  to  call  for  conveyance  of  marketable  title  by
whatever  form  of  deed  is  customarily  used  in  the  area.  Thus,  the
contract is complete, valid, and enforceable, even though silent about
these two requirements.

A  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the  contract  so  construed  is
enforceable by either party. Although parol evidence may be admitted
for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  intentions  of  the  parties  to  a
contract,  this  contract  can  be  enforced  without  it,  based  upon  the
presumption described above. C is therefore incorrect.

29. C Some jurisdictions hold that an abstractor of title impliedly warrants
the abstract to be accurate; all jurisdictions agree that there is at least
an  implied  warranty  that  the  service  will  be  performed  in  a
reasonable  manner.  Since  the  right-of-way  deed  was  properly
recorded,  the  abstract  company's  failure  to  include  it  in  the  abstract
that  it  furnished  was  a  breach  of  either  the  promise  to  perform
reasonably or the implied warranty of accuracy. In either event, since
the  buyer  was  an  intended  creditor  beneficiary  of  the  contract
between the seller and the abstract company, the buyer can enforce it.

If there was an implied warranty of accuracy, A is incorrect because
liability  is  imposed  without  fault  for  its  breach.  If  there  was  no
implied warranty of accuracy, A is incorrect because liability may be
imposed  if  the  abstract  company's  lack  of  awareness  of  the  right  of
way resulted from its failure to act reasonably. Since the right-of-way
deed  from  the  owner  of  the  land  to  the  chemical  company  was
properly recorded before any of the grants of the land took place, it
was not outside the chain of title, and B is incorrect. D is incorrect
because  the  liability  of  the  abstract  company  does  not  depend  on
covenants made by the seller.

30. A  If  a  deed  contains  a  restriction  or  covenant  prohibiting  the  grantee
from  using  the  realty  in  a  particular  way,  that  restriction  may  be
equitably enforced (i.e., by injunction) by a successor to the grantor's
interest  against  a  successor  to  the  grantee's  interest  if  the  restriction

832

constitutes  an  equitable  servitude.  A  restriction  may  be  held  to
constitute an equitable servitude if it creates a burden that touches and
concerns the land of the original grantor and a benefit that touches the
land  of  the  original  grantee,  if  the  original  parties  intended  it  to  run
with the land, and if the person against whom enforcement is sought
had  actual  or  constructive  notice  of  the  burden  when  he  or  she
received his or her interest. The restriction touches and concerns the
land  of  the  builder  (against  whom  enforcement  is  sought)  because
only  the  occupant  of  the  builder's  land  can  comply  with  it.  The
restriction  touches  the  land  of  the  other  residents  of  the  subdivision
(who  seek  to  enforce  it)  because  the  value  of  their  realty  will  be
affected  by  the  use  to  which  the  builder's  lot  and  other  realty  in  the
subdivision are put. The fact that the subdivision plan that was filed
contained  a  description  of  the  deed  restrictions  indicates  that  the
original  parties  intended  it  to  be  enforceable  by  all  residents  of  the
subdivision  and  also  serves  to  give  successors  to  original  grantees
constructive  knowledge  of  the  restriction.  Thus,  the  restriction  is
enforceable  as  an  equitable  servitude  against  the  builder  by  other
residents of the subdivision.

B is incorrect because the enforcement of restrictive covenants in the
deeds  to  lots  in  a  subdivision  does  not  depend  on  the  will  of  other
members  of  the  subdivision.  Restrictions  that  touch  and  concern  the
land  outlive  buildings  that  are  on  the  land  and  do  not  cease  to  be
enforceable  simply  because  those  buildings  have  ceased  to  be
operative.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  Changes  in  the  community  may
result in a decision to stop enforcing deed restrictions only where the
changes are such that it is no longer substantially possible to secure
the  benefits  that  the  restrictions  were  intended  to  create.  D  is
incorrect because no facts indicate that such a change has occurred.

31. B Ordinarily, a tenant who abandons the premises before the expiration
of the lease is liable for rent for the balance of the term. If, however,
the  landlord  surrenders  his  or  her  rights  under  the  lease,  the  tenant
will  be  free  from  liability  for  the  balance  of  the  term.  A  surrender
generally takes place when the landlord occupies the premises for his
or her own purposes.

Re-letting  the  premises  for  the  balance  of  the  term  might  be  a
surrender  of  the  landlord's  rights  or  might  be  performed  on  the
defaulting  tenant's  account  to  mitigate  damages,  depending  on  the
intent  of  the  landlord.  Where,  as  here,  there  is  a  lot  of  other  vacant

833

space in the building, and the landlord has re-let the premises for a
rent lower than provided in the lease, and on a month-to-month basis,
it is not likely that his intent was to surrender his rights but rather to
mitigate  damages.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  agreement  between
the landlord and the tenant did not restrict use of the premises to any
particular activity. For this reason, the fact that the premises are not
well suited to the activity that the tenant had in mind, or that the tenant
is no longer licensed in the practice for which he planned to use them,
is  irrelevant  to  his  liability  under  the  lease.  C  and  D  are  therefore
incorrect.

32. B If a conveyance of realty is complete in all other respects but silent as
to  the  interest  that  is  being  conveyed,  it  is  presumed  to  convey
whatever  interest  the  grantor  holds  at  the  time  the  conveyance  is
executed.

Thus,  A  and  C  are  incorrect.  Although  a  deed  to  realty  should
expressly identify the parties, the realty, and the interest conveyed, D
is  incorrect  because  without  language  to  the  contrary,  the  deed  is
presumed to convey whatever interest the grantor held.

33. B The distinguishing feature of joint tenancy is that it includes the right
of survivorship. This means that, although a joint tenant may sever a
joint tenancy during his or her lifetime, if he or she dies without doing
so, his or her interest passes to surviving joint tenants. The result is
that unless the joint tenancy is severed by one of the joint tenants, the
joint  tenant  who  lives  the  longest  will  become  the  holder  of  the
combined  interests  of  all  the  original  joint  tenants.  To  give  effect  to
this principle, it is understood that upon the death of one of the joint
tenants,  his  or  her  share  passes  to  the  remaining  joint  tenants,
increasing the fractional shares that they hold in joint tenancy. Since a
will  speaks  only  upon  the  death  of  the  testatrix,  the  deceased
daughter's  purported  devise  to  the  youngest  daughter  did  not  occur
during the deceased daughter's life and therefore could not sever the
joint tenancy. As a result, the surviving daughters continue to be joint
tenants, the share of each being increased from one-third to one-half.

A and C are incorrect because the surviving daughters continue to be
joint  tenants  for  the  reason  given  above.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
deceased  daughter  could  not  sever  the  joint  tenancy  by  will,  and
therefore her interest will be divided equally between the surviving
joint tenants.

834

34. D Ordinarily, an adverse possessor of realty acquires title only to that
portion of the realty that he or she actually occupied and possessed.
One  who  occupies  any  portion  of  a  parcel  of  realty  under  “color  of
title”  (i.e.,  pursuant  to  a  written  instrument  that  appears  to  convey
title),  however,  is  said  to  occupy  it  all.  Since  the  buyer  openly,
notoriously, hostilely, and continuously occupied a portion of the land
for  the  statutory  period  under  color  of  the  title  conveyed  by  the
sheriff's deed, he has acquired title to that entire parcel of realty by
adverse possession.

Although  the  document  under  which  the  buyer  believed  himself  to
have  title  proved  to  be  defective,  A  is  incorrect  because  of  the
interest  that  he  acquired  by  adverse  possession.  B  is  incorrect
because  he  occupied  a  portion  of  the  realty  under  color  of  title.
Although possession of part of the premises under color of title may
result in acquisition of title to the whole, the general rule is that the
adverse  possessor  may  acquire  title  only  to  that  portion  of  the
premises  that  he  or  she  has  actually  occupied.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.

35. A  A  conveyance  is  recorded  outside  the  chain  of  title  if  a  reasonable
search of the chain of title to the realty conveyed would not disclose
that it occurred. A tract index identifies parcels of realty by number
and enables a title searcher to trace the chain of title by searching for
transactions involving realty identified by the appropriate number. By
using  a  tract  index  to  search  for  transactions  involving  the  land's
parcel number, a title searcher would discover that the land had been
conveyed  by  the  first  buyer  to  the  second  buyer,  and  by  the  second
buyer to the third buyer. Without a tract index, a title searcher traces
the chain of title by searching for transactions involving appropriate
grantees  and  grantors.  Without  a  tract  index,  a  title  searcher  would
have no way of determining that the realty conveyed by the first buyer
to the second buyer and by the second buyer to the third buyer was the
land,  because  the  landowner's  conveyance  of  the  land  to  the  first
buyer had never been recorded, so there was nothing in the record to
connect  the  first  buyer  with  the  land.  Thus,  the  conveyance  from  the
first buyer to the second buyer was recorded outside the chain of title.
For the purpose of determining priorities under a recording statute, a
conveyance  outside  the  chain  of  title  is  treated  as  an  unrecorded
conveyance.  Under  the  statute,  no  conveyance  of  realty  is  effective
against  a  subsequent  purchaser  without  notice  of  it  unless  it  was

835

recorded. Since the deed from the first buyer to the second buyer is
treated  as  unrecorded,  neither  it  nor  the  subsequent  deed  from  the
second  buyer  to  the  third  buyer  (which  is  also  outside  the  chain  of
title)  is  effective  against  the  fourth  buyer,  who  purchased  without
notice.

Recording  statutes  determine  the  priority  of  interests.  Under  the
statute given, the first buyer's conveyance to the second buyer and the
second buyer's conveyance to the third buyer are not effective against
the  fourth  buyer  for  the  reasons  given  above,  and,  as  a  result,  the
fourth buyer's interest takes priority over the third buyer's. This does
not  mean,  however,  that  the  first  buyer  did  not  have  the  power  to
convey  the  realty.  If  the  landowner  purported  to  sell  to  a  purchaser
who  had  notice  of  the  landowner's  previous  conveyance  to  the  first
buyer, for example, the first buyer's conveyance to the second buyer
would have been effective against that purchaser. For this reason, B
is  incorrect.  Intentional  misrepresentation  by  the  landowner  might
make the landowner liable in tort for damages, but it does not affect
the rights of the third buyer and the fourth buyer as against each other.
C is therefore incorrect. Since the fourth buyer is seeking to establish
that  his  title  is  superior  to  the  third  buyer's,  knowledge  by  the  third
buyer's predecessor is not relevant. D is therefore incorrect.

36. C  An  easement  is  an  interest  in  realty.  A  license  is  permission  to  use
realty.  An  interest  in  realty  cannot  be  conveyed  except  by  written
instrument.  Thus,  the  oral  permission  that  the  landowner  gave  the
fisherman could not have created an easement and must have created
a license. Unless consideration is given for it, a license to use realty
is revokable at will by the licensor or his or her successor. In most
jurisdictions,  a  license  automatically  terminates  when  the  realty  is
sold  by  the  licensor.  In  those  jurisdictions,  the  fisherman's  license
terminated  upon  the  landowner's  sale  to  the  buyer.  In  a  few
jurisdictions, a license survives the sale of the realty, but if it was a
revocable license, it remains revocable. Since the fisherman did not
give consideration for the license, it was revocable, and if it survived
the  sale  to  the  buyer,  it  was  effectively  revoked  when  the  buyer
ordered the fisherman off the property.

A  is  incorrect  because  knowledge  by  a  grantee  that  the  grantor
created  a  license  to  use  the  realty  does  not  cause  the  license  to
survive the sale. B and D are incorrect because the oral permission

836

could not have resulted in any easement. D is also incorrect because
an easement appurtenant does survive the sale of the servient estate.

37. B A remainder is a grantee's future interest that will become possessory
upon the termination of a prior estate that is certain to terminate. If the
remainder  is  not  subject  to  any  conditions  precedent  other  than  the
event  that  terminates  the  prior  estate,  it  is  said  to  be  vested.  If  it  is
subject  to  an  additional  condition  precedent,  it  is  said  to  be
contingent.  Since  the  brother  will  surely  die,  the  termination  of  the
brother's life estate is inevitable, and the son's interest is a remainder.
Since  there  are  no  other  conditions  precedent  to  the  son's  interest
becoming possessory, it is a vested remainder. Since the gift is to be
shared by all the brother's children, however, the interest that the son
receives  will  be  diminished  if  the  brother  has  any  more  children
before his death. It is thus subject to partial divestment.

A  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  condition  that  would  result  in
complete divestment of the son's interest. A gift to an unborn person
is usually regarded as contingent (i.e., upon his or her birth). For this
reason, the son's interest at the time of the landowner's death could be
described  as  a  contingent  remainder.  When  the  son  was  born,
however,  the  contingency  was  satisfied,  and  his  interest  became
vested (subject to partial divestment). C is therefore incorrect. D is
incorrect  because  the  son  had  a  vested  remainder  subject  to  partial
divestment.

38. A Ordinarily, a tenant who abandons the premises before the expiration

of the lease is liable for rent for the balance of the term.

The  lease  may  reserve  to  the  landlord  the  right  to  terminate  the
tenancy  and  reenter  in  the  event  of  non-payment,  but  B  is  incorrect
because this is an alternative to the right to collect rent, not the source
of  it.  A  landlord  who  elects  to  terminate  the  tenancy  will  not  be
entitled  to  collect  rent  for  the  balance  of  the  term.  C  is  incorrect,
however, because a landlord may elect not to terminate and hold the
tenant  for  rent.  D  is  incorrect  because  neither  party  to  a  lease  may
avoid obligations under it merely by giving notice, unless the lease so
provides.

39. B In determining the extent of the estate conveyed and the restrictions to
which  it  is  subject,  the  courts  look  to  the  deed  that  conveyed  it.  If
there  is  a  disagreement  between  the  contract  of  sale  and  the

837

conveyance,  the  language  of  the  conveyance  prevails.  Although  the
Statute of Frauds requires the transfer of an interest in realty to be in
writing  and  signed  by  the  party  to  be  charged,  most  courts  hold  that
accepting  and  recording  a  conveyance  containing  restrictions  in  the
use of the land conveyed binds the grantee to those restrictions even
though  he  or  she  did  not  sign  the  deed  in  which  they  appeared  or
agree to them in the contract of sale.

The  operation  of  a  commercial  cannery  next  to  a  residence  might
constitute  a  private  nuisance,  depending  on  the  character  of  the
neighborhood  and  the  way  in  which  the  cannery  is  operated.  A  is
incorrect,  however,  because  such  an  operation  is  not  necessarily  a
nuisance.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  restriction  in  the  deed  is
controlling.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  developer  accepted  and
recorded the deed.

40. B Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must
vest, if at all, within a period measured by a life or lives in being plus
21  years.  Options  to  purchase  realty  are  required  to  meet  the
requirements of the Rule Against Perpetuities unless they are attached
to a lease or other interest in the realty held by the optionee. Since the
option  purports  to  convey  a  right  to  purchase  at  a  time  beyond  the
period prescribed by the Rule, it is void.

A and C are incorrect because notice, whether actual or constructive
(i.e., by recording), does not make valid an interest that violated the
Rule.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  option  violates  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities.

41. A If the landlord makes it physically impossible for the tenant to occupy
some  portion  of  the  premises,  the  lease  has  been  breached.  This  is
called an actual partial eviction. In that case, the tenant is entitled to
withhold the entire rent, not just the part attributable to the portion of
the  premises  from  which  the  tenant  has  been  actually  evicted.
Importantly,  the  tenant  can  withhold  rent  without  moving  out  of  the
rest  of  the  premises.  Here,  since  it  is  physically  impossible  for  the
tenant  to  occupy  the  basement,  the  landlord  has  committed  an  actual
partial  eviction  of  the  tenant.  Therefore,  the  tenant  is  entitled  to
withhold all of the month's rent, and he does not need to move out of
the premises.

B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

838

42.  C  In  a  foreclosure  sale,  the  owner  of  the  equity  in  the  foreclosed
property does not receive anything until all persons having a lien or
security interest in the property have been satisfied. A judgment lien
creditor typically gets an interest that is equivalent to a mortgage, and
the priority of that lien dates from the day the lien is filed. Here, since
the bank has a judgment lien from the first foreclosure, it is entitled to
be  paid  in  full  before  the  landowner  gets  anything.  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  finance  company  has  been
satisfied  through  foreclosure  and  the  landowner  no  longer  owes  it
anything.  D  is  incorrect  because  $3,000  is  more  than  the  bank  is
owed.

43. C  A  deed  does  not  effectively  convey  an  interest  in  realty  until  it  has
been “delivered” to the grantee. Delivery to one tenant in common is
usually regarded as delivery to all. If the deed named the landowner
and the nephew as tenants in common, it can be successfully argued
that  possession  by  the  landowner  indicates  delivery  to  her  as  a
grantee,  which  would  satisfy  the  requirement  of  delivery  to  the
nephew, her co-tenant. While it is not certain that a court would come
to this conclusion, C is the only one of the additional facts listed that
could possibly support the nephew's claim.

Delivery of a deed may occur even though the deed is not physically
placed in the grantee's hands, but only if there is some act by which
the  grantor  manifests  the  intention  to  make  the  deed  presently
effective. In A,  the  landowner's  words  simply  indicate  her  intention
that  the  transfer  not  take  effect  until  her  death.  A  is  therefore
incorrect. B is incorrect because the 
fact that the nephew was out of the country on the day the landowner
executed the deed does not indicate anything about her state of mind
when  she  executed  it.  D  is  incorrect  because  when  the  deed  was
signed is irrelevant in determining the intent of the grantor.

44. C Title to realty does not pass by deed unless the deed is delivered to
the  grantee  while  the  grantor  is  alive.  For  delivery  to  occur,  the
grantor  must  perform  some  act  that  manifests  an  intention  for  the
conveyance  to  be  presently  effective.  Usually,  this  is  done  by
physically placing the deed in the grantee's hands. Although this is not
the only available method of delivery, it is apparently the one that the
landowner chose, since she instructed her chauffeur to bring the deed
to  her  niece.  Since  the  chauffeur  was  the  landowner's  employee,

839

however,  the  landowner  retained  the  right  and  power  to  change  her
mind and instruct him not to give the deed to her niece, or even to tear
it  up.  Since  she  retained  this  control  over  the  deed,  it  might  be
concluded that she never manifested an intention to make a presently
effective transfer. While it is not certain that a court would come to
this conclusion, C is the only argument listed that could possibly be
effective in opposition to the niece's claim.

is 

recording.  B 

Although  physical  delivery  to  the  grantee  is  a  common  way  of
manifesting the intention to make a presently effective transfer, A  is
incorrect because it is not the only way. Recording statutes determine
the priority of interests in realty but do not determine the validity of
those  interests.  For  this  reason,  a  valid  transfer  of  realty  can  occur
without 
incorrect.  An  attempted
therefore 
testamentary  substitute  is  a  living  person's  attempt  to  make  a
disposition of property after his or her death without complying with
the  statutory  formalities  required  for  wills.  The  law  regards  these
formalities  as  so  important  that  an  attempt  to  make  a  testamentary
disposition without them is usually invalid. D is incorrect, however,
because  if  the  deed  had  been  delivered  to  the  niece  prior  to  the
landowner's  death,  it  would  have  been  effective  immediately  and
would  thus  have  been  an  inter  vivos  transfer  rather  than  a
testamentary disposition.

45. C Title by adverse possession results from the operation of a statute of
limitations  that  prevents  an  action  to  recover  possession  from  being
brought after a specified period of time. But the statute does not begin
to  run  against  a  potential  plaintiff  until  he  or  she  has  a  possessory
right  in  the  realty.  Since  the  neighbor  had  no  right  to  possession
during the life of the friend, the statute did not begin running against
him  until  the  friend's  death.  Since  the  friend  did  have  a  possessory
interest at the time his brother's occupancy began, the statutory period
ran  against  the  friend.  As  a  result,  the  friend's  brother  had  probably
acquired the friend's interest by adverse possession. Since the friend's
interest  was  a  life  estate,  however,  his  brother's  interest  terminated
upon the friend's death.

A  is  incorrect  since  hostile  means  against  the  right  of  the  owner.
Possession without the owner's permission is hostile. B is incorrect
because  open  and  notorious  means  in  full  view  of  the  world  and
does  not  require  that  the  owner  have  actual  knowledge.  D  is  a

840

fabrication that lacks any meaning at all. In any event, tacking refers
to  one  adverse  possessor's  getting  credit  for  a  previous  adverse
possessor's time.

46. D Depending on the law of the jurisdiction, the “husband” to whom the
landowner's will refers is either her first husband, to whom she was
married when the will was executed, or her second husband, to whom
she was married when she died. Under the Rule Against Perpetuities,
no  interest  is  good  unless  it  must  vest,  if  at  all,  within  a  period
measured by a life or lives in being plus 21 years. A will is effective
upon the death of the testatrix. If the will gave a life estate to the first
husband,  the  rights  of  the  children  and  grandchildren  vested
immediately  upon  the  landowner's  death,  since  the  first  husband  is
already  dead.  Since  this  is  within  the  period  described  by  the  Rule
Against  Perpetuities,  their  interests  are  valid.  If  the  will  gave  a  life
estate  to  the  second  husband,  the  interests  of  the  children  and
grandchildren will vest upon the death of the second husband. Since
this is within the period described by the Rule Against Perpetuities,
their interests are valid.

If a class to which an interest in realty is given can be determined at
the time the interest vests, the interest is valid even though the class
could not be determined when the interest was created. If the will left
a  life  estate  to  the  first  husband,  A  is  obviously  incorrect  since  the
size  of  the  class  was  already  determined  when  the  interest  was
created  (i.e.,  on  the  death  of  the  landowner).  If  the  will  left  a  life
estate to the second husband, the only grandchildren who will take the
estate  are  those  born  to  a  child  of  the  landowner's  who  dies  before
the  second  husband.  Since  the  deceased  child  could  not  have  any
children  after  his  or  her  own  death,  the  class  of  grandchildren  who
will receive the substitutionary gift can be determined at the time the
interest vests. A, therefore, would still be incorrect. Since a will is
effective  upon  the  death  of  the  testatrix,  the  interests  devised  by  the
landowner's  will  were  created  when  the  landowner  died.  Since  she
could not marry after her death, B is incorrect. If the will left a life
estate  to  the  second  husband,  the  interests  of  the  daughter's  children
will vest only if the daughter dies before the second husband. Since
the  daughter's  life  and  the  second  husband's  life  were  both  in  being
when  the  interest  was  created  (i.e.,  when  the  landowner  died),  the
interests  will  vest,  if  at  all,  during  a  period  measured  by  a  life  or
lives in being. C is therefore incorrect.

47.  D  Frequently,  deeds  contain  language  restricting  the  way  the  realty
conveyed  may  be  used.  Such  language  may  help  to  define  the  estate
conveyed by imposing a condition that limits the possessory right of
the grantee, or it may simply create a contractual obligation between
the  grantor  and  the  grantee.  A  conveyance  of  realty  in  fee  simple
transfers absolute ownership, subject to any limitations that appear in
the  conveyance.  A  fee  simple  may  be  restricted  by  language  that
makes  it  determinable  or  which  subjects  it  to  defeasance  upon  the
happening  of  a  condition  subsequent,  or  which  subjects  it  to  an
executory  limitation.  If  the  language  indicates  that  the  grantor  will
automatically get the realty back upon the happening of a stated event,
it creates a fee simple determinable. If the language indicates that the
grantor  has  a  right  to  do  something  to  get  the  realty  back  upon  the
happening  of  a  stated  event,  it  creates  a  fee  simple  subject  to  a
condition  subsequent.  On  the  other  hand,  restrictive  language  in  a
deed  may  simply  create  a  contract  between  the  grantor  and  the
grantee,  which,  if  breached  by  the  grantee,  entitles  the  grantor  to
damages.  Usually,  courts  hold  that  the  restrictive  language  creates
nothing  more  than  a  contract  unless  it  specifically  provides  for
termination  of  the  grantee's  estate  in  the  event  the  restrictions  are
violated.  Since  the  language  of  the  restriction  in  the  seller's  deed  to
the  buyer  does  not  specifically  provide  for  the  termination  of  the
buyer's  estate  in  the  event  that  the  realty  is  used  for  purposes  other
than  residential,  it  probably  created  no  more  than  a  contractual
obligation.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this
conclusion, D is the only answer listed that could possibly be correct.

An executory limitation gives a future interest to someone other than
the  grantor,  so  if  the  language  in  the  deed  created  an  executory
limitation, it would not result in judgment for the seller. B is incorrect
because  the  violation  of  a  covenant  contained  in  a  deed  is  not
sufficient to divest the grantee of the realty. C is incorrect because the
Rule Against Perpetuities is not applicable to the interest of a grantor.

48.  B  A  grantee's  future  interest  that  will  become  possessory  upon  the
termination  of  a  prior  estate  is  either  a  remainder  or  an  executory
interest. If termination of the prior estate is inevitable, the interest that
follows  it  is  a  remainder.  The  remainder  is  contingent  if  there  is  a
condition precedent to it other than termination of the prior estate. If
termination  of  the  prior  estate  is  not  inevitable,  the  interest  that
follows it is an executory interest. Under the language of the will, the

842

estate  of  “my  children”  will  not  terminate  unless  the  friend  lives
another 30 years after this person's death. Since this is not inevitable,
the friend's interest is executory. Under the Rule Against Perpetuities,
no  interest  is  good  unless  it  must  vest,  if  at  all,  within  a  period
measured by a life or lives in being plus 21 years. Since the friend's
interest will vest, if at all, during the friend's lifetime, his executory
interest is valid.

D is therefore incorrect. The friend's interest is not a remainder since
the prior estate will not terminate unless the friend lives another 30
years after the death, and this is not inevitable. A and C are therefore
incorrect.

49.  C  For  a  burden  imposed  by  a  deed  restriction  to  be  applied  to  the
grantee's  (covenantor's)  successor,  it  must  be  one  that  runs  with  the
land. A burden runs with the land if it touches and concerns the land;
if  there  is  privity  of  estate  between  the  covenantor  and  his  or  her
successor, as well as between the covenantor and the covenantee (the
original grantor); and if the parties so intended. A restriction touches
and concerns the burdened land if only the possessor of that land can
comply  with  it.  It  touches  and  concerns  the  benefitted  land  if  the
benefit of the restriction is directly tied to the land. In this case, the
building  restriction  touches  and  concerns  the  land  because  it  affects
the  value  of  the  lot  in  question  and  of  the  surrounding  land,  and
because only the holder of the burdened land can comply with it. The
necessary  privity  exists  because  the  homeowner  purchased  from  the
developer and because the developer purchased from the landowner.
The language indicates that the parties intended the covenant to run. It
therefore may be enforced against the homeowner.

A is incorrect because zoning laws supersede deed restrictions only
when  those  zoning  laws  are  more  restrictive  than  the  deed
restrictions. B is incorrect because if the burden runs with the land, a
successor to the covenantor is bound by the covenantor's promise. D
is a fabrication, with no basis in law.

50. C The recording statute provides that a conveyance that has not yet been
recorded  is  not  effective  against  a  subsequent  purchaser  for  value.
Since the second buyer purchased before the first buyer recorded, the
first buyer's title was inferior to the second buyer's. Since the second
buyer's  quitclaim  to  the  third  buyer  conveyed  whatever  interest  the
second buyer had, the interest that the third buyer received (i.e.,  the

843

second  buyer's)  was  superior  to  the  first  buyer's.  Since  the  third
buyer's  purchase  occurred  before  the  first  buyer  recorded,  the
conveyance  from  the  landowner  to  the  first  buyer  is  not  effective
against the third buyer.

The effect of the recording statute is that a conveyance is not effective
against  a  subsequent  purchaser  unless  it  was  recorded  prior  to  that
purchase.  Since  the  third  buyer  purchased  on  April  15  and  the  first
buyer  did  not  record  until  April  16,  the  first  buyer's  deed  is  not
effective  against  the  third  buyer.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is
incorrect  because  the  statute  does  not  require  that  the  subsequent
purchaser  be  without  notice.  Although  recording  statutes  determine
the priority of interests to realty, they do not determine the rights that
exist between a grantor and grantee. It is not accurate to say that the
first  buyer  received  no  rights  until  he  recorded  because  the
conveyance  by  the  landowner  gave  him  rights  at  least  against  the
landowner. D is therefore incorrect.

51. C An easement is in gross if it is created for the benefit of a grantee in a
status other than that of an owner of a specific piece of realty. Since
this easement was created for the benefit of the phone company rather
than for the owner of a specific parcel of realty, it was in gross. It is
generally  understood  that  commercial  easements  in  gross  may  be
alienated, so long as such alienation does not increase the burden on
the servient estate.

Although  the  statement  in  A  is  accurate,  it  is  inapplicable  and
therefore  incorrect  because  an  easement  appurtenant  is  one  that  is
created for the benefit of a grantee in a status as owner of a specific
piece  of  land.  B  is  incorrect  because  noncommercial  easements  in
gross are generally held to be inalienable. Even if it were an accurate
statement, D  would  not  result  in  the  landowner's  defeat.  It  is  not  an
accurate statement since the landowner sold the subdivision before he
created the easement.

52. C A covenant against encumbrances is a grantor's promise that the title
conveyed is free from liens. If a lien exists when the covenant is made
(i.e.,  on  delivery  of  the  deed),  there  is  a  breach  that  entitles  the
grantee to damages. The farmer's satisfaction of the mortgage cut off
any rights to the realty that the bank had. Thus, although there has been
a  breach  of  covenant,  the  buyer  has  sustained  no  actual  damages.
Most  jurisdictions  would  allow  recovery  of  nominal  damages,

844

however.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  appropriate  remedy  for  breach  of  the
covenant  against  encumbrances  is  an  action  for  damages.  B  is
incorrect because the covenant that was contained in the deed was not
breached until the deed was delivered. There was a breach, though,
because  the  encumbrance  existed  at  the  time  when  the  farmer
delivered the deed. D is therefore incorrect.

53. B  Unless  a  contrary  intention  is  shown,  a  conveyance  to  two  or  more
persons  is  presumed  to  create  a  tenancy  in  common.  Tenants  in
common  are  obligated  to  share  in  the  payment  of  principal,  interest,
and real estate taxes.

they  are  not  required 

Although co-tenants are required to share in the costs of maintenance,
A  is  an  inaccurate  statement  because  in  the  absence  of  a  specific

improvements. C is also an inaccurate statement because unless he or
she  has  ousted  (i.e.,  denied  possession  to)  his  or  her  co-tenants,  a
tenant  in  possession  is  not  required  to  account  to  co-tenants  for  the
rental value of the property occupied.

to  share 

in 

54. D  An  easement  by  prescription  is  obtained  when  one  property  owner
uses  another's  property  in  a  manner  similar  to  adverse  possession.
However, that use must be continuous. If the use is so infrequent that it
resembles  a  minor  trespass,  the  continuous  requirement  is  not  met.
Here, the woman only dumped her leaves on the neighbor's property
at most once a year. This is likely not sufficient to meet the continuous
requirement, and the only way the woman could continue to dump the
clippings and leaves on the property would be if she had obtained an
easement by prescription.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  woman's  infrequent  dumping  of  the
clippings and leaves is unlikely to meet the continuous requirement,
even  if  she  did  this  for  more  than  the  state's  adverse  possession
period. B is incorrect because it appears to be referencing a potential
easement by necessity, and there is no indication the properties were
ever under common ownership. C is incorrect because the neighbor
only  knew  about  the  dumping.  The  relevant  adverse  possession
requirement  is  that  the  use  be  hostile,  and  this  requirement  would
clearly not be met if the neighbor had given his permission. However,
the question said specifically that he did not do so.

845

55. D In jurisdictions that recognize tenancy by the entirety, a conveyance to
a husband and wife is presumed to create a tenancy by the entirety in
the absence of a contrary intention.

A,  B,  and  C  are  incorrect  because  only  persons  who  are  validly
married to each other may hold land as tenants by the entirety.

56.  A  Marketable  title  is  generally  a  title  that  a  reasonable  buyer,  fully
informed of the facts and their legal significance, would be willing to
accept.  It  is  often  impossible  to  tell  in  advance  whether  a  third
person's  claim  to  an  interest  in  realty  will  be  successful.  Since  the
reasonable buyer is not usually willing to purchase an interest that he
or she may lose in later litigation, title is not marketable if anything
could  give  a  third  person  a  reasonable  chance  of  successfully
asserting a claim to an interest in the realty. Thus, the title tendered by
the  doctor  was  marketable  only  if  there  was  no  reasonable  doubt
about the success or validity of a claim that might then be asserted by
persons  claiming  under  the  older  sister's  daughter,  grandchildren,  or
great-grandchildren. The two sisters were joint tenants who have the
right  of  survivorship.  Thus,  the  younger  sister  received  the  older
sister's  interest  upon  the  older  sister's  death,  and  the  older  sister's
attempt  to  will  her  interest  was  ineffective.  As  a  result,  the  friend
received  an  unclouded  title  from  the  younger  sister,  and  since  a
quitclaim  conveys  the  grantor's  interest,  the  doctor  received  an
unclouded title from the friend. While there is nothing to prevent the
assertion  of  a 
the  older  sister's  daughter,  her
grandchildren,  her  great-grandchildren,  or  persons  claiming  under
them, there is no reasonable chance of success for such a lawsuit. The
title that the doctor tendered to the dentist is thus marketable, and the
dentist's refusal to accept it was a breach.

lawsuit  by 

B is incorrect, since if the title was unmarketable, the dentist would
not be required to buy a lawsuit by accepting any deed at all from the
doctor. A quitclaim conveys whatever interest the grantor holds. C is
therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because the effect of a joint tenant's
right  of  survivorship  is  that  the  interest  of  a  joint  tenant  cannot  be
devised by will.

57.  D  Assignment  of  a  leasehold  interest  occurs  when  the  holder  of  the
interest  transfers  to  another  all  that  remains  of  his  or  her  interest.
Sublease of a leasehold interest occurs when the holder of the interest
transfers  part  of  but  not  all  his  or  her  remaining  interest.  Since  the

846

tenant transferred all his remaining interest to the attorney, he made an
assignment. The lease prohibited subletting. Because courts favor the
free alienation of interests in land, contractual restraints on alienation
are  strictly  construed.  For  this  reason,  a  clause  that  prohibits
subletting does not prohibit assignment.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  an  incorrect  statement  of  the  rule;
assignment of a lease is permitted in the absence of an agreement to
the contrary. Even if the lease contained an express reservation of the
landlord's  right  to  terminate  in  the  event  of  a  breach,  the  landlord
could  not  terminate  the  attorney's  leasehold  since  the  tenant's
assignment did not breach his agreement not to sublet. C is therefore
incorrect.

58. A Since the parties to the assignment agreement intended that payments
be made by the investment company to the builder, the builder was a
third-party beneficiary of the assignment agreement and can enforce it
against  the  investment  company.  Unless  released  by  the  obligee,  a
party  to  a  lease,  like  a  party  to  any  other  contract,  continues  to  be
responsible for performance of the obligations thereunder even after
assigning rights or delegating duties that exist under the lease. This is
true  even  if  the  lease  permits  assignment  and  even  if  the  obligee
consents to the assignment. B is incorrect because the builder has not
released the tenant from his obligations under the lease and therefore
can still collect from the tenant.

59.  B  Although  all  the  statements  might  be  logical  ways  of  solving  this
problem, the law is clear that a life tenant is required to pay interest
— to the extent of the reasonable rental value of the realty — and a
remainderman is required to pay the principal.

A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

60. D So long as a description is sufficient to identify the realty conveyed, it
is legally adequate, even though it contains some error with respect to
the size of the parcel. Since the landowner owned only one parcel of
realty  on  Barrett  Road,  the  description  can  identify  only  one  parcel
and is thus adequate.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  delivery  occurred
when  the  landowner  handed  the  deed  to  his  son,  telling  him  that  it
was  a  birthday  present.  The  fact  that  his  son  returned  it  to  the
landowner is not relevant since he only asked the landowner to hold

847

it for safekeeping. C is incorrect because there is no requirement that
a  deed  be  supported  by  consideration,  and  because  once  the  deed
was delivered, there was an executed gift.

61. A Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of loss passes to
the buyer of real estate as soon as the contract is made. On the day of
the  loss,  the  buyer  thus  had  an  insurable  interest  as  defined  by  the
statute.

Although  various  jurisdictions  disagree  about  when  the  risk  of  loss
passes in a sale of realty, all agree that if a party causes a loss, he or
she  bears  the  risks  that  result  from  it.  For  this  reason,  if  the  fire
resulted  from  the  buyer's  negligence,  he  probably  bore  the  risk  of
loss. B is incorrect, however, because it indicates that this is the only
way the buyer would bear the risk of loss, and, under the doctrine of
equitable  conversion,  the  risk  of  loss  fell  upon  him  as  soon  as  the
contract  of  sale  was  formed.  Under  the  doctrine  of  equitable
conversion, as soon as the contract of sale is formed, the risk of loss
passes to the purchaser despite the fact that the seller continues to be
the legal owner until the closing of title. C is therefore incorrect. D is
incorrect  because  the  statute  recognizes  that  an  insurable  interest  is
held  by  the  person  suffering  the  risk  of  loss,  and  the  doctrine  of
equitable conversion passes the risk to the buyer when the contract is
formed.

62. D A remainder interest is vested if there are no conditions precedent to
its becoming possessory other than the termination of the prior estate.
If  there  are  additional  conditions  precedent,  the  remainder  is
contingent.  Since  it  is  inevitable  that  the  brother  will  die,  and  since
there are no conditions precedent to the interests of the children, their
interests are vested. It is possible, however, that the brother will have
additional  children.  If  so,  the  children  will  share  in  the  realty,  but
their shares will be diminished. Their interests are therefore subject
to partial divestment.

A is incorrect since there are no conditions precedent to the vesting
of  their  interests.  B  is  incorrect  because  of  the  possible  partial
divestment  described  above.  C  is  incorrect  because  although  their
shares may be diminished, they will receive some shares.

63. A An easement created by express grant is not affected by the fact that

the reason for its creation no longer exists.

848

B is incorrect because the rights of third persons are not relevant in
the  consideration  of  easement  disputes  between  landholders.  C  is
based on an accurate statement of the law about implied easements by
necessity,  but  it  is  incorrect  because  the  easement  in  question  was
created  by  grant,  and  was  therefore  not  an  implied  easement  by
necessity.  Since  the  three-story  building  is  to  be  a  one-family
residence,  its  existence  will  not  appreciably  increase  the  burden  on
the servient estate. D is therefore incorrect.

64. C Absent an agreement to the contrary, a contract for the sale of realty
calls for the execution and delivery of whatever deed is customarily
used  in  the  area.  Thus,  if  the  use  of  general  warranty  deeds  is
customary,  the  homeowner's  tender  of  a  quitclaim  was  a  breach  that
would excuse the buyer from performance.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  creation  of  a  power  of  attorney  to  sell
realty  implies  the  power  to  contract  for  whatever  deeds  are
customarily  used  in  the  area.  Quitclaims  are  not  customarily  used
anywhere,  except  under  special  circumstances.  A  quitclaim  conveys
whatever  title  the  grantor  held  at  the  time  it  was  executed  and  thus
conveys  marketable  title  if  the  grantor  held  same.  B  is  incorrect,
however,  because  even  if  title  is  marketable,  a  quitclaim  does  not
give  a  grantee  recourse  against  the  grantor  if  problems  should
develop,  and  because  the  contract  implied  a  promise  to  deliver  the
kind  of  deed  customarily  used  in  the  area.  D  is  incorrect  because  a
quitclaim conveys valid title if the grantor held valid title.

65.  A  Under  the  doctrine  of  equitable  conversion,  a  purchaser  of  realty
becomes its equitable owner as soon as the sales contract is formed
and  suffers  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  damage  to  the  premises
prior  to  the  passage  of  title.  Thus,  in  a  jurisdiction  that  applies  the
doctrine  of  equitable  conversion,  the  loss  would  be  suffered  by  the
buyer. He is, therefore, obligated to pay the full contract price in spite
of the fact that the value of the realty has been diminished through no
fault of his own.

B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

66. C A remainder is a grantee's future interest that is to become possessory
after the termination of a prior interest that will inevitably terminate.
An  executory  interest  is  a  grantee's  future  interest  that  follows  an
interest  that  will  not  inevitably  terminate.  Since  the  interest  of  the

849

National  Cancer  Association  was  to  become  possessory  only  if  the
land  was  used  for  the  sale  of  alcohol,  and  since  this  event  is  not
inevitable,  the  interest  of  the  National  Cancer  Association  must  be
executory. A  and  D  are  therefore  incorrect.  Under  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, within a
period measured by a life or lives in being plus 21 years. Since the
land might not be used for the sale of alcohol until after the expiration
of  the  period  of  perpetuities,  and  since  the  interest  of  the  National
Cancer  Association  will  not  vest  until  that  time,  its  interest  is  void
under the Rule Against Perpetuities. [Note: An exception to the Rule
Against  Perpetuities  is  made  for  a  shift  from  one  charity  to  another.
This  exception  does  not  apply  in  this  case  since  the  niece  is  not  a
charity.] C is therefore correct, and A is therefore incorrect. [Note:
The  common  law  “destructibility  rule”  resulted  in  a  merger  of  a
present  possessory  interest  and  a  future  interest  held  by  the  same
person,  even  if  there  were  intervening  contingent  remainders.
Although the question indicates that the jurisdiction has abolished the
destructibility rule, its existence or nonexistence has no application to
these facts.]

67.  B  A  grant  to  a  named  grantee  “and  his  or  her  heirs”  traditionally
conveys a fee interest. A fee simple subject to an executory interest is
a fee interest that will terminate automatically upon the happening of a
specified contingency. The grant of a fee followed by the words “but
if”  is  usually  held  to  create  a  fee  simple  subject  to  an  executory
interest, because the language indicates that the grantee's interest will
not continue beyond the happening of the specified contingency.

A  fee  simple  absolute  is  a  possessory  interest  that  includes  all
present  and  future  interests  in  the  realty.  A  is  incorrect  because  the
grant  limits  the  interest  of  the  friend,  making  it  terminate  upon  the
happening of a specified event. A life estate is a possessory interest
in  realty  that  will  terminate  at  the  end  of  a  specified  life.  Since  the
interest  conveyed  to  the  friend  by  the  deed  will  not  terminate  at  the
end  of  a  specified  life,  it  is  not  a  life  estate.  The  law  does  not
recognize any interest known as a “quasi-life estate.” C is therefore
incorrect.  Under  the  Rule  Against  Perpetuities,  no  interest  is  good
unless  it  must  vest,  if  at  all,  within  a  period  of  time  measured  by  a
life  or  lives  in  being  plus  21  years.  Since  the  interest  of  the  dentist
would  not  vest  until  the  United  States  went  to  war  and  used  the
property  as  a  base,  and  since  this  could  have  occurred  hundreds  of

850

years after the conveyance was made, the dentist's interest was void
under the Rule Against Perpetuities. The fact that a portion of a grant
is void under the Rule Against Perpetuities, however, does not affect
the  validity  of  other  interests  created  by  that  grant.  For  this  reason,
and because the friend's interest vested immediately, D is incorrect.

68.  C  If  the  location  of  an  easement  is  precisely  indicated  by  a  written
instrument, such as the deed that created it, neither the holder of the
dominant  estate  nor  the  holder  of  the  servient  estate  may  relocate  it
without the consent of the other. Sometimes, the fact that the holder of
an  easement  has  stopped  using  it  for  a  substantial  period  of  time
justifies the conclusion that he or she has abandoned it. This always
requires some additional evidence of an intent to abandon, however.
Ordinarily,  two  months  is  not  a  sufficient  length  of  time  to  indicate
abandonment, and since there is no additional evidence of the buyer's
intent  to  abandon  the  easement,  his  use  of  the  paved  road  for  two
months  does  not  imply  consent  to  a  relocation.  Since  this  easement
was  described  by  metes  and  bounds  in  the  deed  that  created  it,  and
since the buyer has not consented to its relocation, it continues to exist
in its original location. Since the holder of the servient estate is not
permitted to interfere with the easement holder's use of the easement,
the buyer is entitled to the relief that he seeks.

Although an implied easement by necessity terminates when the strict
necessity for it terminates, an easement created by express grant does
not  terminate  without  abandonment,  consent,  or  condemnation.  A  is
incorrect  because 
the  buyer's  easement  was  created  not  by
implication,  but  by  grant.  When  the  dominant  and  servient  estates
come to be owned by the same person, there is said to be a merger,
and  preexisting  easements  that  the  dominant  estate  held  over  the
servient  estate  are  extinguished.  B  is  incorrect,  however,  because
after  the  buyer's  easement  was  created,  the  buyer's  lot  was  the
dominant estate and Parcels 1 and 2 were the servient estates, and the
dominant  and  servient  estates  were  not  owned  by  the  same  person.
An  easement  that  directly  benefits  another  parcel  of  realty  (e.g.,  a
right  of  way  for  ingress  and  egress)  is  an  easement  appurtenant.  An
easement  that  benefits  an  individual  regardless  of  his  or  her
relationship to another parcel of realty (e.g., a power company's right
to install power lines) is an easement in gross. Easements appurtenant
are  freely  alienable;  easements  in  gross  are  not.  D  is  incorrect  for
the  buyer's  easement  was  an  easement
three  reasons:  First, 

851

appurtenant; second, easements in gross are not freely alienable; and
third, the case raises no issue regarding alienability.

69. B  A  deed  does  not  operate  to  convey  any  interest  in  land  until  it  has
been delivered. Physical transfer of a deed that is absolute on its face
constitutes a delivery only if the grantor intended to make a presently
effective  transfer  of  an  interest.  When  the  landowner  handed  the
chauffeur a deed and said that it was not to take effect until his death,
his intent may have been to make a present transfer to the chauffeur of
a future interest that would become possessory upon his death. Such
an interest is a remainder. While it is not certain that a court would
come  to  this  conclusion,  B  is  the  only  argument  listed  that  could
possibly support the chauffeur's position.

Although possession by a grantee raises a presumption that there has
been  a  valid  and  effective  delivery,  A  is  incorrect  because  the
presumption  is  not  irrebuttable;  it  may  be  rebutted  by  proof  that  the
grantor  did  not  intend  to  make  a  present  transfer.  A  testamentary
substitute is an attempt by a living person to dispose of property after
his  or  her  death  without  complying  with  the  formalities  that  statutes
require  of  valid  wills.  C  is  incorrect  because  an  attempted
testamentary substitute is ineffective. Delivery is complete when the
grantor does some voluntary act that manifests his or her intention to
make  a  presently  effective  transfer.  Since  there  is  no  indication  that
the  landowner's  death  was  voluntary,  it  could  not  have  completed
delivery. D is therefore incorrect.

70. B The hermit has been in continuous possession for more than 20 years.
His  possession  was  hostile,  because  it  was  contrary  to  the  rights  of
the  city,  the  land's  true  owner.  It  was  open  and  notorious  because  it
was  not  hidden  and  knowledge  of  his  possession  could  have  been
obtained  by  anyone  who  looked.  Having  fulfilled  all  the  statutory
requirements, he would ordinarily be correct in his assertion that he
has  acquired  title  by  adverse  possession.  Most  jurisdictions,
however, prohibit the acquisition of city or state property by adverse
possession.  This  being  the  only  legal  obstacle  to  the  hermit's
assertion,  the  outcome  will  most  likely  depend  on  whether  the
jurisdiction  permits  the  acquisition  of  city  property  by  adverse
possession.

A  is  incorrect  because  if  the  possession  was  open  and  notorious  as
described  above,  it  does  not  matter  whether  the  actual  owner  ever

852

really  knew  of  it.  Some  adverse  possession  statutes  establish  a
condition that the adverse possessor pay taxes on the realty during the
period  of  his  or  her  adverse  possession.  C  is  incorrect,  however,
because  this  statute  did  not  contain  such  a  requirement.  An  adverse
possessor  who  occupies  land  under  color  of  title  may  become  the
owner  of  all  the  land  that  he  or  she  believed  he  or  she  owned,
including  that  which  he  or  she  did  not  actually  occupy.  Since  the
hermit asserts ownership only of the land that he occupied, however,
color of title is irrelevant, and D is incorrect.

71.  B  Joint  tenancy  is  a  form  of  co-ownership  in  which  the  joint  tenants
have the right of survivorship. This means that upon the death of one
joint  tenant,  the  others  receive  equal  shares  in  his  or  her  interest.
When the wife's mother died, the husband and the wife received equal
shares of her interest. The joint tenancy of the husband and the wife
continued, but each held a one-half interest in the whole instead of a
one-third interest. Joint tenants may convey their interests inter vivos
without  each  other's  consent,  but  a  joint  tenant's  grantee  takes  as  a
tenant  in  common  with  the  remaining  owners.  Thus,  upon  the  wife's
conveyance  to  the  coach,  the  coach  and  the  husband  were  tenants  in
the  husband's
common,  each  with  a  one-half 
conveyance  to  the  neighbor,  the  neighbor  and  the  coach  became
tenants in common, each with a one-half interest.

interest.  Upon 

A is incorrect because, as a joint tenant with right of survivorship, the
wife's mother could not effectively pass her interest by will. Since a
conveyance  by  a  joint  tenant  makes  the  grantee  a  tenant  in  common,
neither the coach nor the neighbor received a joint tenancy in any part
of the estate. C is therefore incorrect. D is incorrect for this reason,
and  because  the  friend  received  no  interest  at  all  under  the  wife's
mother's will.

72.  A  Today,  all  jurisdictions  have  recording  statutes  that  determine
priorities.  In  cases  not  covered  by  the  recording  statutes,  however,
common  law  rules  of  priority  apply.  The  statute  in  this  question
determined the priority of interests in cases in which the subsequent
taker  was  a  purchaser  for  value  and  without  notice.  Since  the  son
received the conveyance as a gift, he gave nothing in return for it, and
therefore  he  was  not  a  purchaser  for  value.  As  a  result,  the  statute
does  not  apply,  and  common  law  rules  of  priorities  do.  At  common
law,  priorities  between  successive  transferees  of  interests  in  real

853

property are determined simply on the basis of chronology — “first in
time, first in right.” Thus, since the bank received its interest before
the son received his interest, the bank's is superior.

If  the  statute  was  applicable,  the  bank's  interest  would  have  been
superior to the son's only if the bank's mortgage was recorded before
the land was conveyed to the son. If the mortgage was not recorded
before  the  conveyance  occurred,  the  fact  that  the  mortgage  was
recorded  before  the  conveyance  was  recorded  would  not  give
priority  to  the  mortgage.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Unless  an
applicable  recording  statute  has  a  contrary  effect,  a  grantee  of
mortgaged  realty  takes  subject  to  the  mortgage,  whether  or  not  the
existence  of  the  mortgage  is  mentioned  in  the  grantee's  deed.  Since
the  recording  statute  is  not  applicable  to  the  son's  interest,  the  son
took  the  realty  subject  to  the  bank's  mortgage.  C  is  therefore
incorrect. D  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  statute  imposes
the  requirement  of  value  on  junior  claimants  and  the  bank  is  the
senior claimant, and second, the bank was a purchaser for value since
it gave consideration (i.e., a loan of $20,000) in return for an interest
in realty (i.e., the mortgage).

73.  A  Under  the  doctrine  of  accession,  the  owner  of  realty  becomes  the
owner of anything that becomes part of the realty. Consequently, since
a court has ruled the fireplace has become part of the realty, the tenant
isn't entitled to any compensation.

B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

74. A Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must
vest, if at all, during a period measured by a life or lives in being plus
21 years. Since it is possible that the change in use would occur after
the  end  of  this  period,  both  grants  to  Second  Foundation  would
appear  to  violate  the  Rule.  The  Rule  Against  Perpetuities  is  not
applied,  however,  to  shifts  from  one  charity  to  another,  so  Second
Foundation's interest in Greenacre is valid. Since the nephew and the
niece  are  not  charities,  Second  Foundation's  interest  in  Redacre  is
invalid. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

75. D While a tenant who vacates after an assignment is no longer in privity
of  estate  with  the  landlord,  he  or  she  continues  to  be  in  privity  of
contract under the initial lease and continues to be liable for rent. The
assignor's  liability  is  secondary,  while  the  assignee's  liability  is

854

primary.  Thus,  if  the  landlord  is  successful  in  collecting  from  the
tenant, the tenant may seek indemnity from the store owner. This does
not, however, protect the tenant from liability to the landlord.

The  lease  required  the  tenant  to  obtain  the  landlord's  permission
before  assigning.  If  he  had  not  done  so,  some  jurisdictions  might
permit  the  landlord  to  avoid  the  assignment.  In  any  event,  however,
the landlord's consent does not operate to destroy his contract rights
against  the  tenant.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  novation  is  an
agreement  by  which  parties  to  a  contract  substitute  a  new  party  for
one of the original parties. For a novation to occur, there must be an
agreement by the new party to assume the contractual obligations of
the  party  whom  he  or  she  is  replacing,  and  an  agreement  by  the
original obligee to extinguish the contractual obligations of the party
who is being replaced. Although the store owner agreed to personally
assume  the  tenant's  obligations  under  the  lease,  the  landlord  did  not
agree  to  relieve  the  tenant  of  those  obligations.  Thus,  there  was  no
novation, and B is incorrect. Usually, an assignee of a tenant's rights
under  a  lease  is  liable  to  the  landlord  only  for  rent  that  accrued
during  the  assignment  period.  An  assignee  who  personally  assumes
obligations under the lease may also be liable for rent accrued before
the  assignment  took  place  or  after  reassignment.  The  assumption  of
obligations  by  an  assignee  might,  thus,  impose  additional  duties  on
that assignee. It does not, however, relieve the assignor of any of his
or her initial obligations to the landlord. C is therefore incorrect.

76.  D  A  fixture  is  a  former  chattel  which,  by  reason  of  its  annexation  to
realty, has become part of the realty. A tenant is entitled to use leased
realty but not to remove parts of it when he or she leaves. Thus, if the
improvements made by the tenant were fixtures (i.e., became part of
the  realty),  the  tenant  would  not  be  entitled  to  the  judgment  that  he
seeks.  One  of  the  factors  considered  in  determining  whether  an
improvement made by the tenant was so annexed to the realty as to be
a fixture is whether it can be removed without causing any substantial
damage  to  the  realty.  If  so,  the  improvement  may  be  regarded  as  a
chattel that belongs to the tenant, and which he is, therefore, entitled
to remove, rather than as a fixture that has become part of the realty.
Although  this  factor  alone  might  not  be  sufficient  to  keep  the
improvements from being regarded as fixtures, it is the only one listed
that could support the conclusion that they are not.

The value of the improvements is not relevant since even a valuable

855

improvement may be a fixture if it became part of the realty, and if so,
it  belongs  to  the  landlord.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect
because  an  improvement  is  a  fixture  if  it  has  become  part  of  the
realty,  and  this  does  not  logically  depend  on  whether  it  was
foreseeable that the tenant would make it. The general rule is that the
tenant  may  not  remove  fixtures  unless  the  parties  agreed  to  the
contrary.  Absent  such  an  agreement,  the  general  rule  applies.  C  is
therefore incorrect.

77. D An easement is the right to use realty of another. The realty subject to
the easement is called the servient estate. If the benefit that the holder
of an easement receives is associated with his or her ownership of a
particular parcel of realty, the easement is appurtenant, and the realty
benefitted by that easement is called the dominant estate. Easements
appurtenant  are  freely  alienable,  usually 
transferred  with  a
conveyance  of  the  dominant  estate.  If  an  easement  is  recorded,
subsequent grantees of the servient estate have constructive notice of
its  existence  and  take  the  servient  estate  subject  to  the  easement.
Since  according  to  the  advice  in  option  D,  the  easements  that  the
doctor  and  lawyer  would  grant  each  other  would  be  for  access  to
their own parcels of realty, they would be easements appurtenant. The
effect  of  the  transaction  would  be  that  the  doctor  and  lawyer  each
would own half of the driveway and hold an easement over the other's
half.  Since  the  easements  would  be  appurtenant,  they  would  be
transferable  to  any  transferees  of  the  dominant  estates.  Since  they
would  be  recorded,  they  would  bind  any  transferees  of  the  servient
estates.  Thus,  each  property  owner  would  have  the  right  to  use  the
entire driveway (i.e.,  the  half  that  he  or  she  owns  and  the  half  over
which he or she has an easement), and neither would have the right to
interfere with the other's use.

A is incorrect because such a contract would bind only the parties to
it. If the successor to either were to partition, the only remedy would
be an action for damages against the original promisor. B is incorrect
since a joint tenant may sell his or her interest, the grantee becoming
a  tenant  in  common  with  the  remaining  party.  This  would  leave  the
remaining  party  in  the  same  position  that  he  or  she  was  in  the
beginning.  C  is  based  on  an  inaccurate  statement  of  the  law,  since
tenants in common do have the right to partition.

78.  D  Valid  title  is  not  necessarily  marketable.  Since  no  one  should  be

856

required  to  purchase  a  lawsuit,  marketable  title  means  title  about
which there is no reasonable doubt of validity. To decide whether the
son held marketable title in August 2013, it is necessary to determine
whether  the  quitclaim  that  he  executed  in  2008  could  possibly  have
affected  his  title  to  the  realty.  A  will  speaks  on  the  death  of  the
testator. This means that no devise of an interest in realty created by
the landowner's will was of legal effect until the landowner's death in
2010. The son, thus, had no interest at all in the land in 2008 when he
executed the quitclaim to the bank. Since a quitclaim conveys only the
interest that the grantor holds at the time of its execution, the son gave
up no interest in the realty as a result of the 2008 quitclaim. Under the
landowner's will, the son received a remainder in a one-third interest
in  the  land  that  became  possessory  upon  the  death  of  the  eldest
daughter in June 2013. His title was therefore marketable on the day
he tendered the deed to the buyer.

Although a quitclaim conveys whatever interest the grantor possesses
at  the  time  of  its  execution,  A  is  incorrect  because  the  son  held  no
interest  in  the  land  when  he  executed  the  quitclaim  to  the  bank  in
2008.  A  remainder  is  a  future  interest  that  will  become  possessory
upon  the  termination  of  a  prior  estate,  the  termination  of  which  is
inevitable.  Since  the  eldest  daughter's  death  was  inevitable,  the  son
received  on  the  death  of  the  landowner  a  remainder  that  became
possessory on the death of the eldest daughter. The son's interest was
therefore  valid,  making  B  incorrect.  A  general  warranty  deed
ordinarily  contains  a  grantor's  warranty  that  he  or  she  holds  the
interest that is conveyed. But no one is required to buy a lawsuit. A
warranty of title provides a remedy against the grantor, but it does not
make the title marketable. Were title unmarketable at the time that the
son  tendered  the  deed,  the  son  would  be  failing  to  fulfill  his
obligation  under  the  contract  of  sale,  and  the  buyer  could  not  be
required to go through with the transaction. C is therefore incorrect.

79. C After granting an interest in realty, a grantor may continue to hold one
of three future interests in the realty. If the grantor has conveyed any
interest that is less than that which he or she holds, his or her future
interest  is  a  reversion  (e.g.,  the  grantor,  who  holds  a  fee  simple
absolute, conveys only a life estate or an estate for years. In that case,
the  grantor  retains  a  reversion.)  If  the  grantor  conveys  his  or  her
interest in a way that may result in the grantee's eventual loss of the
interest  conveyed,  the  grantor's  possible  future  interest  is  either  a

857

possibility of reverter or a right of reentry. If the grantee's interest is
to  terminate  automatically  upon  the  happening  of  a  specified  event,
the grantee's interest is determinable, and the grantor's future interest
is called a possibility of reverter. (E.g., the grantor, who holds a fee
simple absolute, conveys “to the grantee for so long as the premises
are used for residential purposes.” In that case, if the premises ever
cease  to  be  used  for  residential  purposes,  the  grantee's  estate  will
terminate  automatically  and  the  fee  will  revert  to  the  grantor.  The
conveyance has given the grantee a fee simple determinable, and the
grantor  retains  a  possibility  of  reverter.)  On  the  other  hand,  if  the
grantee's  interest  will  not  terminate  automatically,  but  the  grantor
retains the right to terminate the grantee's interest on the happening of
a  specific  event,  the  grantee's  interest  is  subject  to  a  condition
subsequent, and the grantor's future interest is a right of reentry. (E.g.,
the grantor, who holds a fee simple absolute, conveys “to the grantee,
but if the premises ever cease to be used for residential purposes, the
grantor  may  reenter.”  The  conveyance  has  given  the  grantee  a  fee
subject  to  a  condition  subsequent,  and  the  grantor  retains  a  right  of
reentry.)

Although  the  conveyance  executed  by  the  landowner  contains
language that may result in the church's loss of its interest, it does not
convey  an  interest  less  than  that  held  by  the  landowner.  For  this
reason,  the  future  interest  retained  by  the  landowner  cannot  be  a
reversion  and  must  be  either  a  possibility  of  reverter  or  a  right  of
reentry. The deed makes use of the realty for non-church purposes an
event that results in the church's loss of its interest. Since the church's
interest  in  the  land  will  terminate  automatically,  and  there  is  no
language  indicating  that  the  landowner  has  to  do  something  to  take
back the land (i.e., no mention of a right to reenter in the deed), C is
correct.

A  remainder  is  a  future  interest  held  by  a  grantee  that  will  become
possessory  following  the  inevitable  termination  of  a  prior  estate.
Since the landowner was the grantor rather than a grantee, his interest
cannot  be  a  remainder.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect
because the landowner did not convey less than his entire interest. An
executory  interest  is  a  future  interest  held  by  a  grantee  that  will
become possessory following the termination of the prior estate when
termination  is  not  inevitable.  Since  the  landowner  was  the  grantor
rather than a grantee, his interest cannot be executory. D is therefore

858

incorrect.

80. D Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must
vest,  if  at  all,  not  later  than  21  years  after  some  life  in  being  at  the
creation of the interest. Importantly, under the common law, if a gift is
made  to  a  class,  the  entire  gift  fails  unless  it  can  be  said  that  each
class member must have his or her interest vest or fail within lives in
being  plus  21  years.  This  rule  is  triggered  if  the  class  could  obtain
new members after the testator's death. Importantly, under the “fertile
octogenarian” rule, there is a conclusive presumption that any person,
regardless of age or physical condition, is capable of having children.
Here,  it  would  appear  the  gift  is  invalid  because  the  daughter  is
presumed to be able to have another child, and that child could take
after  lives  in  being  plus  21  years  —  for  example,  all  of  the  son's
children  might  be  born  after  the  landowner's  death,  and  might  die
more  than  21  years  after  the  landowner's  death.  Consequently,  in
courts  taking  a  strict  common-law  approach  to  class  gifts,  the
daughter's  three  now-living  children  would  not  take  anything  since
their interest violates the Rule. Under the “fertile octogenarian” rule,
it does not matter that the daughter could not possibly have any further
children.  However,  even  courts  that  generally  follow  the  common-
law Rule Against Perpetuities will usually allow the gift to stand as
to  any  member  of  the  class  who  was  alive  at  the  moment  the  gift  is
created.  Consequently,  the  daughter's  three  children  will  take  the
property since they were alive at the moment the gift was created.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

81. D An easement is a right to use, but not to possess, the land of another.
The  land  that  is  subject  to  an  easement  is  known  as  the  servient
tenement or estate. The holder of an easement may not overburden the
servient  estate.  This  means  that  the  easement  holder  may  not  change
the easement or use it in a way that was not contemplated when it was
created. An easement holder has the right and the duty to maintain the
easement  but  may  not  do  so  in  a  way  that  would  overburden  the
servient estate. Some cases have held that paving an easement that has
long existed as a dirt road overburdens the servient estate. Whether or
not  a  court  would  so  hold  in  this  case  is  unknown.  The  easement
created  by  the  deeds  was  only  12  feet  wide,  however,  and  the  third
buyer  now  seeks  to  widen  it  to  24  feet.  This  would  undoubtedly
overburden the servient estate since it would increase the portion of
that estate that is subject to use by the easement holder and reduce the

859

portion available for unlimited use by its owner.

Sometimes a change in circumstance may justify a change in use of an
easement.  The  fact  that  the  road  becomes  muddy  after  a  heavy  rain,
for example, might justify paving it. A is incorrect, however, because
doubling the width of the easement is a change substantial enough to
result  in  an  overburdening  of  the  servient  estate.  The  holder  of  a
servient  estate  has  no  obligation  to  maintain  an  easement  running
across it, while the user of such easement is required and is entitled
to  maintain  it  at  his  or  her  own  expense.  This  does  not  give  the
easement holder the unilateral right to make changes in the easement,
however, simply because he or she is willing to pay for them himself
or  herself.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Even  if  the  construction  of  the
road that the third buyer proposes to build would improve the value
of the lots affected, the second buyer is free to reject the improvement
in  value,  choosing  to  keep  his  land  the  way  it  is.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.

82. D Some jurisdictions recognize a special co-tenancy known as tenancy
by the entirety, which can be held only by a husband and wife. Where
it  exists,  tenancy  by  the  entirety  is  like  joint  tenancy  in  that  it  gives
each co-tenant the right of survivorship, but it is unlike joint tenancy
in that neither co-tenant may sever it without the consent of the other.
In  those  jurisdictions  that  recognize  tenancy  by  the  entirety,  it  is
presumed  that  any  conveyance  to  a  husband  and  wife  creates  a
tenancy by entirety. Most such jurisdictions hold that the presumption
may be rebutted by evidence that some other form of ownership was
contemplated  by  the  parties  to  the  conveyance.  The  conveyance  to
wife and husband “as joint tenants and not as tenants in common, with
full right of survivorship” rebuts the presumption and results in a joint
tenancy. Although a joint tenant may convey his or her interest without
the  consent  of  the  other  joint  tenant,  such  a  conveyance  severs  the
joint  tenancy  as  to  the  interest  conveyed  and  makes  the  grantee  a
tenant  in  common.  (Note:  In  some  jurisdictions,  there  is  an
irrebuttable  presumption  that  a  conveyance  to  husband  and  wife
creates  a  tenancy  by  the  entirety.  In  these  jurisdictions,  the  wife's
purported  transfer  to  the  man  would  be  void  unless  the  husband
consented to it. Of the answers listed, however, D is the only one that
could possibly be correct.)

A  quitclaim  extinguishes  the  rights  of  the  person  executing  it  by

860

conveying those rights to the person receiving it, although it does not
specify what those rights are or warrant that they exist. A is therefore
incorrect. Although a quitclaim ordinarily transfers whatever interest
is held by the person executing it, any transfer by a joint tenant severs
the  joint  tenancy.  For  this  reason,  the  wife's  conveyance  to  the  man
severed the joint tenancy, and B is incorrect. C is incorrect because
only a husband and wife may hold title as tenants by the entirety.

83.  B  A  deed  does  not  effectively  convey  realty  until  it  is  delivered.
Although  delivery  does  not  always  require  a  transfer  of  physical
possession  of  the  deed  by  the  grantor  to  the  grantee,  it  does  require
some word or act by the grantor that manifests his or her intent that the
conveyance  shall  have  a  present  operative  effect.  When  the
landowner placed the envelope on the dining-room table, it was with
the intention of mailing it the following morning. Since it was always
possible for him to change his mind before mailing it, the fact that he
planned to mail it is not sufficient to manifest an intent that it would
be  presently  operative.  Since  he  died  without  doing  anything  that
would manifest such an intent, there was no delivery.

Conveyance by deed is not effective unless the deed is accepted by
the grantee, but if the grant is beneficial, the grantee's acceptance is
presumed. Thus, if the landowner had manifested the necessary intent
(e.g.,  by  mailing  the  deed),  a  delivery  might  have  taken  place  even
though the sister died before she became aware of the conveyance. A
is therefore incorrect. The presumption that a grantee has accepted a
deed  can  be  rebutted  by  proof  that  he  or  she  rejected  it.  Such  a
rejection  could  not  take  place,  however,  unless  the  grantee  knew
about  the  deed.  For  this  reason,  if  the  sister  had  sent  back  the
envelope containing the deed without knowing its contents, she would
not have rejected it by so doing. C is incorrect, however, because the
sister's  daughter  was  not  the  grantee  and  because  there  was  no
delivery to the sister. Ordinarily, a grantor's delivery of a deed to a
third person with instructions to deliver it to the grantee is a delivery
to the grantee so long as the grantor relinquished all control. It may be
that mailing a deed has that effect, since the sender ordinarily loses
control over an envelope once it is delivered to the postal authorities.
D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  landowner  did  not  relinquish
control over the envelope before his death.

84. D The taking of an entire parcel of realty by eminent domain results in

861

acquisition by the taker of all present and future interests in the realty.
For  this  reason,  the  leasehold  interest  passes  with  the  rest  of  the
property,  whether  or  not  it  is  specifically  mentioned  in  the  judicial
decree. A is therefore incorrect. Since the lessee thus loses his right
to  occupy  the  property,  he  or  she  is  freed  from  the  obligation  of
paying rent due under the balance of the 
lease.  Also,  a  leasehold  interest  is  a  non-freehold  but  possessory
interest  in  real  property.  As  with  any  property  interest,  if  it  is  taken
for public use, its holder is entitled to “just compensation” under the
Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  Since  taking  the
realty by eminent domain results in a condemnation of the leasehold
as  well  as  the  landlord's  reversion,  the  lessee  is  entitled  to  a
proportionate  share  of  the  condemnation  award.  Since  he  or  she  is
entitled  to  be  compensated  for  what  he  or  she  has  lost,  his  or  her
share should be based on the value of the unexpired balance of his or
her term. Since he or she is no longer obligated to pay rent, however,
the  rent  that  he  or  she  would  have  otherwise  had  to  pay  should  be
deducted from the value.

85. D A person may acquire title to realty by adverse possession if he or she
occupies  it  without  its  owner's  permission  openly,  notoriously,  and
continuously for the statutory period of time. This occurs because the
running  of  a  statute  of  limitations  then  makes  it  impossible  for  the
adverse  possessor  to  be  judicially  ejected.  Since  a  new  owner
acquires  the  old  owner's  right  to  eject  an  unlawful  possessor,  the
statutory period of limitations continues to run in spite of changes in
ownership.  Since  the  artist  has  adversely  possessed  the  realty  for
more than 15 years, she has acquired title by adverse possession.

For the above reason, the fact that the son became the owner in 2004
did not restart the period. If the owner of the realty is under a legal
disability  (e.g.,  infancy)  at  the  time  the  adverse  possession  begins,
commencement  of  the  statutory  period  is  delayed  until  the  legal
disability has terminated. If the owner is not under a legal disability
at  the  time  the  possession  begins,  however,  the  fact  that  he  or  she
subsequently  suffers  a  legal  disability  or  that  title  subsequently
passes to a person who is under a legal disability will have no effect
on the running of the statutory period. Since there is no fact indicating
that the landowner was under  any  legal  disability  in  1997  when  the
artist  began  her  possession  of  the  realty,  the  running  of  the  statutory
period  commenced  at  that  time  and  continued  without  interruption

862

upon  the  passage  of  title  to  the  son.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Since
only a person with a right of possession can sue to eject an unlawful
possessor, the statute of limitations cannot work against the holder of
a  future  interest.  Thus,  an  adverse  possessor  acquires  only  the
possessory  interest  that  existed  at  the  time  of  her  possession.  If,  for
example,  the  landowner  had  been  the  holder  of  a  life  estate  with  a
remainder  in  the  son,  the  artist's  adverse  possession  during  the
landowner's  life  could  have  led  only  to  the  artist's  acquisition  of  a
life estate by adverse possession. Then, upon the landowner's death
in  2004,  a  new  period  of  possession  would  have  begun  against  the
son's fee interest. The will by which the son received title spoke only
upon the landowner's death, however. This means that when the artist
began possession in 1997, the son had no future interest at all. Since
there  is  no  fact  to  the  contrary,  the  landowner's  interest  must  have
been a fee when the artist moved on, and it was this fee that the artist
acquired by adverse possession. For this reason, B is incorrect. C is
incorrect for the reasons given above, because at the time the artist's
adverse  possession  began,  the  holder  of  the  fee  interest  (the
landowner) was under no disability, and because if the possession is
open and notorious, it does not matter whether the owner is aware of
it.

86. C Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of loss passes to
a buyer of realty as soon as a contract of sale is formed. Thus, if the
jurisdiction  applies  this  doctrine,  the  buyer  must  sustain  the  loss
resulting from destruction of the barn.

If an essential part of the realty is destroyed prior to passage of the
risk  of  loss,  a  buyer  might  be  excused  from  performing  his  or  her
obligations  under  the  contract  of  sale.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a
nonessential  part  of  the  realty  is  destroyed,  the  buyer  might  be
required  to  go  through  with  the  purchase  with  an  abatement  of  the
price  to  compensate  for  the  loss.  Thus,  if  the  risk  of  loss  had  not
passed to the buyer, the fact that the barn was not an essential part of
the  realty  might  prevent  him  from  withdrawing  from  the  transaction
but would not permit the seller to collect the full price. A is therefore
incorrect.  Although  many  jurisdictions  hold  that  the  risk  of  loss
passes to a buyer as soon as he or she takes possession of the realty,
there  is  no  principle  of  law  by  which  possession  creates  a
presumption  of  fault.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Once  a  risk  of  loss
passes  to  a  party,  that  party  suffers  the  consequence  of  such  a  loss

863

even if it did not result from his or her fault. Since there are various
theories that might have passed the risk of loss to the buyer (e.g., the
doctrine  of  equitable  conversion,  possession),  the  fact  that  he  was
without  fault  would  not  in  itself  be  sufficient  to  prevent  him  from
bearing the loss. D is therefore incorrect.

87. B Under the facts given, it is possible that the conveyance to the dentist
created an implied easement. This may arise when a grantor conveys
a portion of his or her land, retaining a part over which an apparent
previous use existed that was reasonably necessary to the enjoyment
of  the  portion  conveyed  and  could  have  been  the  subject  of  an
easement. Since the existence of a dirt road made previous use across
the  landowner's  land  apparent,  and  since  river  access  might  be
reasonably  necessary  to  the  use  and  enjoyment  of  the  dentist's  land,
the  deed  to  the  dentist  may  thus  have  created  an  easement  by
implication. Although it is not certain that a court would come to this
conclusion, B  is  the  only  argument  listed  that  might  be  effective  for
the doctor.

An  easement  by  dedication  is  a  use  granted  to  the  public  either  by
deed or by operation of law. Since there is no indication that the dirt
road ever became a public right of way, A is incorrect. An easement
by  express  reservation  is  created  by  a  deed  in  which  the  grantor
retains  a  right  to  use  the  realty  conveyed.  Since  the  dentist  was  a
grantee,  she  could  not  have  obtained  an  easement  by  express
reservation. C is therefore incorrect. An easement by express grant is
created  by  a  deed  that  specifically  conveys  to  a  grantee  the  right  to
use the property of another. Since the landowner's deed to the dentist
did not mention the easement, and since there is no fact indicating that
the dentist ever received it by conveyance, there was no easement by
express grant. D is therefore incorrect.

88.  C  Those  who  own  land  adjacent  to  a  flowing  body  of  water  (i.e.,
riparian  owners)  have  some  rights  to  use  that  water.  Under  modern
common  law,  each  riparian  owner  has  the  right  to  make  reasonable
use  of  the  water.  If  construction  of  a  dam  would  result  in  the
consumption  of  more  water  than  is  reasonably  necessary,  a  court
might hold that the farmer has no right to build the dam.

A is incorrect because the farmer's increased use of the water might
still  be  reasonable.  At  one  time,  it  was  said  that  no  riparian  owner
was  permitted  a  use  that  altered  the  natural  flow  of  the  stream.  If

864

“natural flow” is given a literal meaning, this would make it virtually
impossible for anyone but the furthest downstream owner to use the
water. For this reason, the natural flow rule has given way to a rule
that  bases  riparian  rights  on  reasonable  use.  Thus,  even  if  the  dam
altered the natural flow, the farmer would have a right to construct it
so long as his use was reasonable. B is therefore incorrect. Under the
reasonable use test, the farmer may dam the stream so long as doing
so  would  not  make  his  water  use  unreasonable.  D  is  incorrect
because  this  would  be  so  even  if  he  could  accomplish  the  same
without damming the stream.

89.  D  If  leased  realty  is  taken  by  eminent  domain,  the  leasehold  and  the
reversion  merge  in  the  taker,  the  leasehold  is  terminated,  and  the
obligation  to  pay  rent  ceases.  Since  both  the  lessor  and  the  lessee
have had something of value taken for public use, each is entitled to
receive just compensation for what he or she has lost. The lessor is
entitled  to  receive  the  value  of  the  leased  premises  (including  the
value of rent to be received), minus the value of the leasehold interest
that  he  has  already  conveyed.  The  lessee  is  entitled  to  receive  the
value  of  the  leasehold.  If  not  for  the  condemnation,  however,  the
lessee would have been required to pay rent to enjoy the benefits of
her leasehold. Since the condemnation terminates that obligation, the
rent that the lessee otherwise would have been required to pay should
be deducted from the value of her leasehold.

A is incorrect because the taking terminates the leasehold, and with
it, the obligation to pay rent. The Rule Against Perpetuities provides
that no interest is good unless it must vest if at all within a period of
time  measured  by  a  life  or  lives  in  being  plus  21  years.  Since  a
lessee's  interest  in  leased  premises  vests  at  the  moment  the  lease  is
executed,  the  Rule  Against  Perpetuities  is  inapplicable  to  it.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  Since  the  condemnation  terminates  the  tenant's
obligation to pay rent for the balance of the lease term, allowing her
to  keep  the  entire  $30,000  would  result  in  her  receiving  more  than
she has actually lost. For this reason, C is incorrect.

90.  A  Proceeds  of  a  foreclosure  sale  are  taken  by  holders  of  security
interests in the order of the priority of their respective interests. Since
mortgages  and  trust  deeds  create  security  interests  in  realty,  the
priority  of  the  conflicting  claims  will  be  determined  in  accordance
with the recording statute. The statute given is a typical notice statute.

865

According  to  its  terms,  the  interest  held  by  the  bank  cannot  take
priority  over  the  interest  held  by  the  lender  because  the  bank's
mortgage had not been recorded when the lender received its interest,
the  lender  gave  value  for  its  interest,  and  there  is  no  fact  indicating
that  the  lender  was  aware  of  the  bank's  mortgage  when  the  lender
received its interest.

Since  neither  the  statute  nor  the  common  law  makes  priority
dependent  on  whether  any  person  has  notice  of  the  interests  of
subsequent  takers,  B  is  incorrect.  Recording  statutes  generally  do
apply  to  security  interests  in  realty.  In  addition,  this  statute
specifically refers to the transfer of “an interest in realty,” and so, by
its terms, applies to security interests. C is therefore incorrect. D is
incorrect because a purchase money mortgage is a mortgage given to
the borrower to buy the subject real estate. Here, the landowner was
only trying to buy a boat.

91. A Probably the best-known characteristic of the joint tenancy is the right
of survivorship. Under it, when a joint tenant dies, his or her interest
is not inherited by his or her heirs and distributees but passes to the
remaining  joint  tenants.  At  common  law,  a  joint  tenancy  could  not
exist unless the shares and possessory rights of the joint tenants were
equal, and unless the interests of the joint tenants were created at the
same  time  and  by  the  same  document.  (These  are  known  as  the  four
unities  —  unity  of  interest,  possession,  time,  and  title.)  Many  states
have modified these common law requirements by statute, but even in
those  states,  the  shares  of  joint  tenants  are  presumed  equal  unless
there  is  an  agreement  to  the  contrary.  For  this  reason,  the
reconveyance  by  the  wife  and  her  husband  created  a  joint  tenancy,
with the wife, her husband, and her grandmother each holding a one-
third interest. Upon the wife's death, her third passed to her husband
and her grandmother in equal shares, continuing them in joint tenancy
with each holding a one-half interest in the realty.

B, C, and D are incorrect because upon the death of a joint tenant, the
surviving joint tenants continue in joint tenancy. In addition, B and C
are  incorrect  because  upon  a  joint  tenant's  death,  his  or  her  share
passes equally to the surviving joint tenants.

92.  B  The  language  of  the  covenant  in  the  farmer's  deed  to  the  neighbor
contained  two  parts.  The  first  part  restricted  the  use  of  the  land
conveyed  by  that  deed.  Since  the  farmer  was  not  engaging  in  any

866

activity on that land, this part of the covenant does not burden him at
all.  The  second  part  required  all  further  deeds  to  land  in  the
subdivision  to  bear  the  same  covenant.  Since  the  farmer  has  not  yet
conveyed  any  of  the  other  land  in  the  subdivision,  none  of  it  is
burdened by the covenant.

A covenant that runs with the land benefits successors to the original
covenantee and burdens successors to the original covenantor. Thus,
a  covenantee's  successor  may  enforce  it  even  though  it  was  not
mentioned in his or her deed, and even though he or she was not in
privity with the covenantor. For this reason, A and C  are  incorrect.
For a covenant to run, it must touch and concern the land. A covenant
restricting the use of land in a subdivision touches and concerns the
covenantor's estate because it affects the value of the burdened estate
and because only the person in possession of that estate can possibly
be  burdened  by  it.  Such  a  covenant  touches  and  concerns  the
covenantee's  estate  because  the  permitted  uses  of  land  in  a
subdivision  necessarily  affect  the  value  of  other  land  in  the
subdivision. For these reasons, D is incorrect.

93. C A periodic tenancy is a tenancy that will continue for a stated period
and  for  repeated  similar  periods  unless  terminated  by  proper  notice
from one of the parties. Since the written agreement created a tenancy
for  one  month  that  was  to  automatically  renew  each  month  unless
terminated as provided, it created a periodic tenancy.

A  tenancy  for  years  is  an  estate  for  a  fixed  determinable  period  of
time (not necessarily measured in years). Since the written agreement
did not fix a time for the expiration of the tenant's tenancy, it did not
create a tenancy for years. A is therefore incorrect. A tenancy at will
is an estate without a fixed duration that will continue until terminated
by  either  party.  By  its  nature,  it  is  continuous  until  affirmatively
terminated.  Unlike  the  periodic  tenancy,  its  continuation  does  not
depend on the automatic renewal of an agreement for a stated period.
Since the written agreement of January 1 was for one month subject to
automatic renewal, B is incorrect. When a tenant fails to vacate at the
expiration  of  his  or  her  leasehold,  he  or  she  becomes  a  tenant  at
sufferance.  D  is  incorrect  because  a  tenancy  at  sufferance  is  not
created by written agreement.

94.  B  Voluntary  waste  consists  of  some  act  by  a  possessory  tenant  that
diminishes  the  value  of  the  realty  or  otherwise  “injures  the

867

inheritance.” One of the ways in which it is committed is by removing
minerals  from  the  land.  Ordinarily,  when  a  life  tenant  commits
voluntary waste, the holder of a vested remainder is entitled to bring
an  immediate  action  at  law  for  damages.  In  the  alternative,  the
remainderman may be entitled to the equitable remedies of injunction
and  an  accounting  for  profits  already  derived  from  the  sale  of  such
minerals. (Note:  Although  it  is  understood  that  a  possessory  tenant
may remove minerals from realty that is good for no other purpose, or
may continue removing minerals from a mine that was open when his
or  her  tenancy  began,  neither  of  these  exceptions  applies  under  the
facts in this case.)

A  possessory  tenant  who  commits  voluntary  waste  is  not  entitled  to
retain any of the profits from his or her activity. For this reason, the
church is entitled to all profits derived from the sale of gravel, rather
than  merely  to  a  proportionate  share.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  It  is
sometimes  held  that  the  holder  of  a  contingent  remainder  or  a
remainder subject to divestment has no right to sue for waste until his
or her interest vests indefeasibly. Since the remainder interest held by
the  church  is  already  vested,  however,  C  is  incorrect.  The  rule  that
permits  a  possessory  tenant  to  continue  removing  minerals  from  a
mine  that  was  open  when  he  or  she  began  his  or  her  tenancy  is
sometimes known as the “open pit” doctrine. D is incorrect, however,
because the facts indicate that gravel had never before been mined or
removed from the land.

95. A A class gift is a gift to a group of persons undefined in number when
the  gift  is  made.  The  landowner's  will  created  a  class  gift  since  it
devised  the  realty  to  all  children  of  the  son  without  specifying  their
names or their number. A class gift passes to all persons who are in
the class at the time the class opens or who enter the class prior to its
closing. Ordinarily, a class opens at the time the gift is created. Since
the landowner's will spoke at the time of the landowner's death, and
since  the  sons  were  already  in  existence  at  that  time,  they  are
obviously within the class and entitled to an interest in the realty. In
determining whether the daughter received an interest, it is necessary
to decide when the class closed. If there are members of the class in
existence  at  the  time  the  class  gift  is  created,  the  class  opens  and
closes immediately upon creation of the gift. Since the sons were in
existence  at  the  time  of  the  landowner's  death,  the  class  closed
immediately upon the landowner's death. For this reason, the daughter

868

did  not  enter  the  class  before  its  closing  and  therefore  received  no
interest in the realty.

B and C are incorrect for the above reason. Under the Rule Against
Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, within a
period  of  time  measured  by  a  life  or  lives  in  being  plus  21  years.
Since  the  son  was  in  being  at  the  time  the  landowner's  will  spoke,
and  since  the  son  could  not  have  children  after  his  own  death,  no
interest  created  by  the  landowner's  will  could  possibly  vest  after  a
period measured by the life of the son. D is therefore incorrect.

96. D In the contract between the landlord and the lawyer (i.e., the lease),
the lawyer agreed to pay rent of $1,000 per month for the entire term
of the lease. The lawyer cannot unilaterally change this obligation by
assigning  the  lease  to  another.  Thus,  although  the  assignment  to  the
doctor might make the doctor responsible for rent, it does not free the
lawyer  of  such  liability.  For  this  reason,  the  landlord  is  entitled  to
collect from the lawyer all unpaid rent.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  doctor's  liability  is  additional  to  the
lawyer's  and  does  not  free  the  lawyer  from  liability.  B  and  C  are
incorrect  because  the  lawyer  agreed  to  pay  rent  for  the  entire  lease
period.

97.  D  Probably  the  best  known  attribute  of  joint  tenancy  is  the  right  of
survivorship.  This  means  that  when  one  joint  tenant  dies,  the
remaining joint tenants inherit the interest of the deceased. Sale of an
interest  by  a  joint  tenant  destroys  the  joint  tenancy  as  to  the  seller's
interest,  and  the  buyer  takes  as  a  tenant  in  common.  The  other  joint
tenants  continue  to  be  joint  tenants,  however.  This  means  that  when
the first buyer conveyed her interest to the first buyer's daughter, the
first  buyer's  daughter  became  a  tenant  in  common  with  a  one-third
interest,  while  the  second  buyer  and  the  third  buyer  continued  to  be
joint  tenants  as  to  the  remaining  two-thirds.  Because  of  the  right  of
survivorship,  the  second  buyer's  attempt  to  transfer  his  interest  by
will was ineffective. As a result, upon the second buyer's death, the
third buyer (as the second buyer's joint tenant) survived to the second
buyer's interest, and the second buyer's son received no interest at all.
Since  the  third  buyer  already  held  a  one-third  interest  and  since  he
inherited the second buyer's interest, the third buyer ended up with a
two-thirds interest.

A  is  incorrect  because,  as  a  result  of  the  third  buyer's  right  of

869

survivorship, the second buyer's will could not pass an interest to his
son. B is incorrect for the same reason, and because sale by a joint
tenant breaks the joint tenancy as to the seller's interest, which means
that  the  first  buyer's  daughter  took  as  a  tenant  in  common.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  first  buyer's  daughter  took  as  a  tenant  in
common and therefore did not receive any share of the second buyer's
interest upon the second buyer's death.

98. C Title to property may be acquired by adverse possession if the person
claiming  such  title  occupies  the  realty  openly,  notoriously,  hostilely,
and  continuously  for  the  statutory  period.  Possession  is  “open  and
notorious”  if  the  possessor  has,  in  general,  behaved  as  an  owner.
Since  the  man  occupied  the  premises  every  summer,  his  possession
was open and notorious. Possession is “hostile” if it is contrary to the
rights of the owner. Since the facts do not indicate that the man had the
owner's  permission  to  occupy  the  cabin,  his  occupancy  was  hostile.
While  possession  must  be  “continuous,”  it  need  not  be  without
interruptions  if  the  interruptions  are  consistent  with  the  appropriate
use  of  the  realty.  Since  this  was  a  summer  cabin,  occupancy  only
during  the  summers  might  have  been  consistent  with  its  appropriate
use. If it was, the man has acquired title by adverse possession.

Once the period of possession has begun, it continues to run in spite
of  conveyances  or  other  changes  in  ownership.  Thus,  A  is  an
inaccurate statement and is therefore incorrect. If the owner of realty
is  under  a  legal  disability  at  the  time  adverse  possession  begins,
computation  of  the  period  of  possession  does  not  start  until  the
disability ends. If, however, the owner is not under a legal disability
at the time adverse possession begins, subsequent legal disability or
legal disability of a subsequent owner does not interrupt the running
of the period. B is therefore incorrect. Because of the requirement that
adverse  possession  be  hostile  to  the  rights  of  the  owner,  one  who
occupies  with  permission  of  the  owner  cannot  acquire  title  by
adverse possession. D is therefore incorrect.

99.  A  By  its  terms,  the  given  recording  statute  applies  only  where  the
subsequent taker is a “purchaser for value.” Since the niece received
the  realty  as  a  gift,  she  is  not  a  purchaser  for  value.  The  recording
statute,  therefore,  does  not  apply.  In  the  absence  of  an  applicable
recording  statute,  the  common  law  rule  of  “first  in  time  —  first  in
right” prevails. Since the bank received his interest before the niece

870

received  hers  (i.e.,  the  bank  is  first  in  time),  the  bank's  interest  is
superior to the niece's.

By definition, a mortgage is a security interest in realty. B is therefore
an  inaccurate  statement  and  is  incorrect.  As  explained  above,  the
absence of an applicable recording statute makes the niece's interest
inferior  to  the  bank's  because  it  was  created  after  the  bank's.  C  is
therefore  incorrect.  Since  the  conveyance  to  the  niece  made  no
mention  of  the  bank's  mortgage,  the  niece  is  without  notice  of  its
existence. The statute only protects a person without notice, however,
if he or she is a purchaser for value. D is therefore incorrect.

100. C A grantee's future interest is a remainder if it follows an estate that is
certain  to  terminate.  If  there  are  no  conditions  precedent  to  the
remainder  becoming  possessory  other  than  termination  of  the  prior
estate,  the  remainder  is  vested.  If  there  are  additional  conditions
precedent,  the  remainder  is  contingent.  Since  the  grandson's  estate
becomes  possessory  on  the  death  of  either  the  son  or  daughter,  and
since  these  deaths  are  certain  to  occur,  the  grandson's  interest  is  a
vested remainder.

A  is  incorrect  because  only  a  grantor  can  hold  a  reversion.  B  is
incorrect  because  except  for  the  death  of  the  life  tenant,  there  is  no
condition  precedent  to  the  grandson's  interest  becoming  possessory.
Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must
vest, if at all, during a period measured by a life or lives in being plus
21  years.  Since  the  grandson's  interest  is  vested,  it  does  not  violate
the Rule Against Perpetuities. D is therefore incorrect.

101. C A joint tenancy means that two or more people own a single, unified
interest in the property. A joint tenancy also means the parties to the
joint tenancy share a right of survivorship (meaning that if one dies,
the  other  joint  tenants  become  owners  of  the  deceased  tenant's
interest).  There  are  several  ways  in  which  a  joint  tenancy  can  be
destroyed, and severance normally results in a tenancy in common. A
tenancy in common has no right of survivorship. Importantly, if there
are three or more original joint tenants, a conveyance by one of them
to  a  stranger  will  create  a  tenancy  in  common  between  the  stranger
and  the  original  joint  tenants.  However,  the  joint  tenancy  will
continue  between  the  original  joint  tenants.  Here,  the  conveyance
creates a tenancy in common between the friend and the two younger
brothers for one-third of the property, but the younger brothers' joint

871

interest  in  the  remaining  two-thirds  of  the  property  survives.
Consequently,  if  the  friend  dies,  his  interest  will  go  to  his  heirs  or
devisees.  If  one  of  the  brothers  dies,  his  interest  will  go  to  his
brother.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

102. C Under the “Rule in Dumpor's Case,” many jurisdictions hold that if a
landlord consents to an assignment by the tenant, the covenant against
assignment is thereafter waived and the assignee may in turn assign to
another  without  being  bound  by  the  covenant.  Although  it  is  not
certain that the court in this jurisdiction would apply the rule, C is the
only  option  listed  that  could  possibly  be  effective  in  the  neighbor's
defense.

Courts  strictly  construe  restraints  against  the  alienation  of  leasehold
interests.  This  means  that  a  covenant  against  assignments  does  not
prevent subleases, and vice versa. A is incorrect, however, because
although  such  covenants  are  strictly  construed,  they  are  not  void.
Ordinarily,  an  assignment  made  in  violation  of  a  covenant  not  to
assign is valid, and the landlord has no remedy other than an action
for damages resulting from the breach. Where, as here, however, the
landlord  reserves  the  right  to  terminate  the  lease  in  the  event  of  a
violation of the covenant, the assignment is voidable at the landlord's
election. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  An  assignment  is  a  transfer  of  all
remaining rights under a lease; a sublease is a transfer of less than all
remaining rights. Since the manager transferred all remaining rights to
the neighbor, the transfer was an assignment, and D is incorrect.

103. A The extinguishment of an easement must normally satisfy the Statute of
Frauds.  Consequently,  the  business  owner's  oral  statement,  taken  by
itself,  did  not  extinguish  the  easement.  In  that  case,  the  easement
would  pass  to  the  buyer  when  he  purchased  the  dominant  tenement,
and the woman cannot now force the buyer to make a new agreement.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  easement  was  not  extinguished,  so  the
buyer's  reliance  is  immaterial.  C is  incorrect  because  the  thing  that
distinguishes  a  license  from  an  easement  is  the  fact  the  license  is
revocable  at  the  will  of  the  licensor.  Here,  the  question  is  dealing
with an easement, not a license, and this statement is a misstatement
of the correct rule. D is incorrect because the woman did not have to
receive  a  benefit  from  the  sale  for  the  easement  to  remain

872

enforceable.

104. A Every contract for the sale of realty contains an implied covenant by
the seller that he or she will deliver marketable title. Marketable title
means  title  that  is  reasonably  secure  against  attack.  It  is  generally
understood  that  title  to  property  that  is  being  used  in  violation  of  a
zoning  law  is  not  marketable.  If  a  seller  is  unable  to  deliver
marketable title, the buyer is not required to complete the transaction
because no person should be required to purchase potential litigation.
Since the buyer's agreement to purchase the house was connected with
his  purchase  of  the  business,  it  is  likely  that  a  court  would  find  that
the  zoning  violation  constitutes  a  defect  that  excuses  the  buyer  from
going through with the purchase. Although it is not certain that a court
would come to this conclusion, A is 
the only option that could possibly be correct.

B and C are incorrect because the courts usually hold that an existing
zoning  violation  makes  title  unmarketable.  D  is  incorrect  because  a
public law that prohibits a particular activity takes precedence over a
private rule that permits it.

105. C A fee simple subject to an executory interest is a fee interest that is
defeased in favor of a third person upon the happening of a specified
event.  Here,  the  Foundation  for  Hereditary  Diseases  will  take  the
property if the friend ever uses it for the sale of alcohol.

Although an interest that might vest after a period measured by a life
or  lives  in  being  plus  21  years  is  void  under  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities, this does not affect the validity of any prior estate. For
this  reason,  even  if  the  interest  of  the  Foundation  for  Hereditary
Diseases violates the Rule Against Perpetuities, it has no effect on the
validity of the friend's interest. A is therefore incorrect. A fee simple
absolute is complete ownership that is not subject to defeasance. B is
incorrect because of the special limitation created by the phrase “so
long as.” A fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is an interest
that is subject to defeasance on the happening of a specified event but
which  does  not  terminate  until  the  holder  of  the  future  interest  takes
some  step  to  make  his  or  her  interest  possessory.  D  is  incorrect,
however,  since  there  is  no  indication  that  the  foundation  has  to  do
anything to take the property.

106. A In those jurisdictions that apply the doctrine of equitable conversion,

873

a purchaser under a real estate sales contract becomes the equitable
owner of the realty and bears the risk of loss as soon as the contract is
formed.  In  those  jurisdictions  that  have  adopted  the  Uniform  Vendor
and  Purchaser  Risk  Act,  the  risk  of  loss  does  not  pass  to  the  buyer
until either title or possession has passed. But both these rules apply
only  when  the  parties  have  not  agreed  to  the  contrary.  Parties  to  a
contract are free to agree as to when the risk of loss is to pass. In this
contract, the parties agreed that the risk of loss would not pass until
title was conveyed.

B, C,  and  D  are  incorrect  because  they  ignore  the  agreement  of  the
parties.

107. A A contract for the sale of realty is unenforceable unless it adequately
describes the subject realty. Similarly, a deed is ineffective unless it
adequately  describes  the  realty  conveyed.  For  these  purposes,  any
description  of  realty  is  adequate  if  it  clearly  identifies  the  property
being conveyed. There can be no doubt that the description would be
adequate if the landowner's was the only realty in the county known
as The Dancing L and identified by the Tract, Lot, and Parcel numbers
given. (Note: So long as it clearly identified the property involved,
the  description  in  the  deed  tendered  by  the  landowner  would  have
been  adequate  even  if  the  property  was  not  the  only  parcel  in  the
county known as The Dancing L or was not the only parcel known by
the  Tract,  Lot,  and  Parcel  numbers  given.)  If  the  description  is
adequate, the contract of sale is enforceable, and the landowner has
fulfilled  his  obligation  under  it  by  tendering  the  deed.  The  builder's
refusal to accept the deed would thus be a breach that would entitle
the landowner to damages.

A contract for the sale of realty, like any other contract of sale, must
identify the subject of the agreement. If it does not, it is unenforceable
because the court would be unable to fashion a remedy for its breach.
B is incorrect because it suggests that a contract that is not sufficiently
specific  to  be  enforced  becomes  enforceable  simply  because  the
parties entered into it. C and D are incorrect because any description
that clearly identifies the realty is sufficient even if it is not expressed
in metes and bounds or the standard form.

108. C When a joint tenant dies, the interest is extinguished at the moment of
the joint tenant's death and the other joint tenant becomes sole owner
of the entire property. Consequently, the property interest cannot pass

874

to  heirs,  devisees,  or  mortgagee  or  judgment  lien  creditors.  Here,
while the brother purported to give a lien against all of the property,
his interest vanished at the time of his death and the bank held nothing.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

109. D An appurtenant easement is terminated by merger if the dominant and
servient  estates  come  into  common  ownership,  and  it  does  not
automatically revive if they are severed. Thus, when the second buyer
sold Lot 3 back to the landowner, the easement terminated. When the
third buyer received Lot 3 from the landowner by a grant that did not
mention the right of way, he took it free of the right of way.

Since the third buyer received title to Lot 3 free of the easement, the
landowner could not unilaterally revive it. A is therefore incorrect. B
is  incorrect  because  the  easement  terminated  by  merger  when  the
landowner reacquired Lot 3. C is incorrect because non-use is not in
itself sufficient to terminate an easement that was created by express
reservation or grant.

110. B  A  remainder  is  a  future  interest  in  a  grantee  that  will  automatically
become  possessory  following  a  prior  estate  that  will  terminate
inevitably (e.g., a life estate). An executory interest is a future interest
in a grantee that will not automatically become possessory and which
follows  a  prior  estate  that  will  not  terminate  inevitably.  Since  the
interest  of  Family  Life  will  become  possessory  only  if  racial
discrimination  is  practiced  by  Family  Center,  and  since  this  may
never  happen,  the  interest  of  Family  Life  is  best  classified  as  an
executory interest. Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is
good unless it must vest, if at all, during a period measured by a life
or  lives  in  being  plus  21  years.  Since  Family  Center  might  begin
practicing  racial  discrimination  after  the  period  proscribed  by  the
Rule, the interest of Family Life seems to violate the Rule. Because of
an exception, however, the Rule Against Perpetuities does not apply
to the interest of a charity that follows the interest of a charity. Since
Family  Center  and  Family  Life  are  both  charitable  institutions,  the
Rule  Against  Perpetuities  does  not  apply,  and  the  interest  of  Family
Life is valid.

D  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  and  C  are  incorrect  because  it  is  not
inevitable  that  the  interest  of  Family  Center  will  terminate,  and  the
interest of Family Life, therefore, cannot be a remainder.

875

111. A  A  life  tenant  is  entitled  to  make  reasonable  use  of  natural  resources

for the purpose of maintaining the realty.

B  is  incorrect,  however,  because  this  right  is  limited  to  reasonable
use.  The  term  waste  is  used  to  describe  any  substantial  change  in
realty that occurs while it is in the possession of a person holding less
than a fee interest. If the change is beneficial to the value of the realty,
it  is  known  as  ameliorating  waste.  C  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:
First, the destruction of trees on a parcel of realty is not necessarily
ameliorating  waste  since  that  term  would  be  used  only  if  such
destruction  benefits  the  value  of  the  realty,  and  second,  since
ameliorating waste benefits the realty, a court is not likely to enjoin it.
D is incorrect because a life tenant is not required to permit decay to
continue simply because it began while the realty was possessed by a
prior tenant.

112. D The landowner's will devised a contingent remainder to the niece and
an  alternate  contingent  remainder  to  the  oldest  child  of  the  niece
living at the time of the landowner's death. Since the niece's daughter
was  not  the  oldest  child  living  at  the  time  of  the  landowner's  death,
she received no interest.

She did not receive a vested remainder since she had no right at all to
take  the  realty.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  She  did  not  receive  a
contingent  remainder  because  there  was  no  condition  that  would
result  in  her  taking  the  realty.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  She  did  not
receive  an  executory  interest  because  there  was  no  condition  that
would entitle her to divest a previous estate and assert an interest in
the realty. C is therefore incorrect.

113. A Under this recording statute (a pure race-type statute), the first interest
recorded  is  superior.  The  daughter's  interest  derives  from  the  deed
that  was  recorded  on  April  3.  Since  the  buyer's  deed  was  not
recorded until April 5, the daughter's interest had priority.

B is incorrect because under a race-type statute, all that matters is the
order in which the interests were recorded. C is incorrect because the
daughter's interest derives from the deed that was recorded on April
3.  The  general  warranty  deed  by  which  the  landowner  conveyed  to
the buyer will determine the buyer's rights against the landowner. But
D  is  incorrect  because  the  recording  statute  determines  the  rights  of
the buyer and the daughter as against each other.

876

114. A A mortgage given as a security interest in realty covers all the realty
at the place described therein, including parts that are affixed after the
mortgage is created. A fixture is a former chattel that has become part
of  the  realty.  Once  it  becomes  part  of  the  realty,  it  is  subject  to  a
security  interest  created  by  a  mortgage  on  that  realty  even  if  the
mortgage was given before the fixture became part of the realty. Thus,
if the cooling tank was a fixture, the mortgage that the farmer gave the
bank  includes  a  security  interest  in  it.  [A  chattel  becomes  a  fixture
when  it  is  permanently  affixed  to  the  realty  or,  even  if  it  is  not
permanently affixed, when its installation is essential to the use of a
particular  building.  Since  both  of  these  conditions  were  met  by  the
installation of the cooling tank, it was a fixture.]

The  question  of  whether  a  chattel  has  become  a  fixture  does  not
depend on whether the person installing it made payments on a note,
so  B  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  a  fixture  is  subject  to  a
mortgage on the realty even if affixed to the realty after the mortgage
was created. The dairyman is not personally liable for payment of the
note  because  the  property  was  conveyed  “subject  to”  the  mortgage,
but the realty — including fixtures — is subject to enforcement of the
mortgagee's rights. D is therefore incorrect.

115. C  Ordinarily,  no  person  has  a  right  to  an  unspoiled  view.  Thus,  in  the
absence  of  special  circumstances  (such  as  those  making  the
interference a nuisance), interference with the view is not actionable
even  if  the  person  complaining  was  there  first  or  if  the  newcomer
knew that his or her building would obstruct a view.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

116. C  The  landowner's  will  specified  the  amount  to  be  paid  to  each  child
and grandchild who reached 22, and the 22-year-old's share does not
depend  on  the  number  of  children  and  grandchildren  who  will  meet
that condition. Since she was 22 at the time of the landowner's death,
she  already  met  the  condition,  and  her  interest  vested  immediately
without any possibility of defeasance.

A is incorrect for two reasons: First, there are situations in which the
interest of a charity might be valid although it does not vest until after
the  period  of  perpetuities  (as  when  its  executory  interest  is  to  vest
following termination of the interest of another charity), and second,
because  the  effect  that  the  vesting  of  her  interest  has  on  that  of  the

877

charity is immediate. B is incorrect because the 22-year-old's share is
specific, and therefore, it does not depend on the number of people in
the  class.  The  validity  of  the  22-year-old's  interest  depends  on
whether  it  must  vest,  if  at  all,  before  the  expiration  of  the  period  of
perpetuities. D is incorrect because there is no reason why this should
depend on whether or not she is the first person to qualify.

117. C The covenant against encumbrances is a representation that there are
no  easements  or  liens  burdening  the  realty.  If  the  realty  is  in  fact
burdened  by  such  an  encumbrance,  the  covenant  is  breached  and
liability is imposed on the covenantor.

This is so even though the purchaser relied on assurances in addition
to  the  covenant,  and  even  though  the  grantor  was  unaware  of  the
existence  of  the  encumbrance  at  the  time  he  or  she  executed  the
covenant.  A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because
there is no indication that the seller failed to act reasonably (i.e., was
“negligent”).

118. D  If  a  joint  tenant  sells  his  or  her  interest,  he  or  she  severs  the  joint
tenancy as to his or her interest, but not as to the interests of the other
joint tenants. The friend, therefore, acquired a one-third interest in the
realty, but as a tenant in common. The two daughters continued to be
joint tenants as to their two one-third interests.

A is incorrect because the friend is a tenant in common. B and C are
incorrect because the two daughters are joint tenants.

119. B A quitclaim deed resembles a release since it purports to convey only
the  interest  that  the  grantor  holds  at  the  time  of  its  execution.  It
includes  no  implied  warranties  for  title,  so  the  grantor  incurs  no
liability if the title that he or she held proves less than perfect.

This is true even if the grantor knew that this title was defective at the
time the quitclaim was executed. A is therefore incorrect. Whether the
grocer  gave  value  for  the  realty  is  not  relevant  in  determining  the
effect  of  the  grocer's  conveyance  to  the  lawyer,  since  an  interest  in
realty  may  be  acquired  without  payment  of  consideration.  C  is
therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because a quitclaim does not imply
a promise by the grantor to act reasonably.

120. D Ordinarily, a covenant cannot be used to benefit lands owned by third
parties.  Since  the  land  in  Olde  Estates  is  no  longer  owned  by  the

878

landowner, the restrictions contained in deeds to lots in Olde Heights
would not, therefore, be enforceable by residents of Olde Estates. If,
however,  it  can  be  shown  that  when  residents  of  Olde  Estates
purchased  their  lots,  it  was  with  the  expectation  that  similar
restrictions  would  be  imposed  on  subsequent  purchasers  of  lots  in
Olde  Heights,  they  will  be  permitted  to  enforce  the  covenants  made
by  Olde  Heights  purchasers  on  a  theory  of  implied  reciprocal
servitudes.  The  best  way  of  establishing  this  expectation  is  by
showing that Olde Estates was part of a common development scheme
with Olde Heights.

A  is  incorrect  since  the  lack  of  privity  between  residents  in  Olde
Heights and those in Olde Estates would prevent the restriction from
being  enforceable  by  residents  of  Olde  Estates.  Although  B  might
result  in  burdens  being  imposed  on  purchasers  of  lots  in  Olde
Heights, it would not make the restrictions enforceable by residents of
Olde Estates. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because such a
clause  would  bind  only  the  grantees  of  the  deeds  but  would  not
burden  successors  to  those  grantees  since  there  will  be  no  privity
between them and the residents of Olde Estates.

121. A The fact that a plaintiff has an adequate remedy against a third person
is  no  defense  for  a  defendant  against  whom  the  plaintiff  has  an
otherwise enforceable right.

B might be an effective defense because many jurisdictions hold that
the  requirement  of  privity  makes  a  covenant  against  encumbrances
enforceable only by the grantee of the deed containing that covenant.
In many jurisdictions, the existence of an encumbrance that is known
to the grantee is not a breach of the covenant against encumbrances. C
might be an effective defense since the bank's mortgage was recorded
prior to the buyer's interest. The developer was therefore on notice of
it. D  is  an  effective  defense  since  a  statute  of  limitations  on  actions
for  breach  of  covenant  contained  in  a  deed  begins  to  run  upon
delivery of the deed containing the covenant.

122. A A description in a deed is legally sufficient if it adequately identifies
the realty being conveyed. Thus, although the description used by the
landowner  is  not  in  the  traditional  form,  it  is  legally  sufficient  if  it
adequately identifies the subject realty.

Where a deed purports to convey a portion of a parcel of realty by a

879

description  that  clearly  states  the  amount  of  land  conveyed  but  does
not adequately describe it, it is sometimes held that the deed conveys
an  unidentified  fractional  portion  of  the  parcel.  B  is  incorrect,
however,  if  the  description  adequately  identifies  the  realty  being
conveyed.  Although  metes  and  bounds  and  reference  to  government
survey markers are the most commonly used forms of description, C
is  incorrect  because  they  are  not  the  only  acceptable  forms.  D  is  a
fabrication with no basis in existing law and is therefore incorrect.

123. C All jurisdictions agree that a party who damages realty bears the risk
of  the  resulting  loss.  This  means  that  since  the  destruction  of  the
premises resulted from the buyer's negligence, he will not be relieved
of his obligations under the contract.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

124. D The law does not recognize an easement for light, air, or view unless

it was created by express grant.

A and B are therefore incorrect. C suggests an estoppel theory, but an
easement  by  estoppel  exists  only  where  there  is  evidence  of  an
attempt to create an express easement that failed for formal reasons.
Since the facts indicate no attempt to create an express easement for
light, air, or view, C is incorrect.

125.  B  In  most  jurisdictions  that  do  not  apply  the  doctrine  of  equitable
conversion, the risk of loss remains with the vendor until the transfer
of either title to or possession of the premises. If the buyer was living
in  the  house  at  the  time  of  the  fire,  his  possession  would,  therefore,
result  in  passage  of  the  risk  of  loss  to  him.  Although  a  minority  of
jurisdictions disagree, B  is  the  only  additional  fact  listed  that  could
result in that finding in any jurisdiction.

Although  some  states  hold  that  a  purchaser  of  realty  acquires  an
insurable interest as soon as the sales contract is formed, his or her
purchase of insurance does not cause the risk of loss to pass to him or
her.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  If  destruction  of  the  house  was
foreseeable when the contract was formed, a party might be prevented
from asserting a defense based on impossibility of performance. If the
risk of loss did not pass to the buyer, however, the fact that such loss
was  foreseeable  would  not  affect  his  or  her  right  to  cancel  the
contract or to abate the purchase price in proportion to the damage. C
is  therefore  incorrect.  Even  if  the  risk  of  loss  has  not  passed  to  the

880

purchaser,  the  vendor  in  a  contract  for  the  sale  of  real  property  is
entitled  to  enforce  it  against  the  purchaser  so  long  as  damage  to  the
premises does not materially affect its value. D is incorrect, however,
because even under those circumstances, the purchaser is entitled to a
proportional abatement of the contract price.

126. C An otherwise valid conveyance is effective upon delivery. Delivery
occurs when the grantor, by words or conduct, manifests an intention
that  the  deed  have  a  present  operative  effect.  Transfer  of  physical
possession  of  the  deed  to  the  grantee  raises  a  presumption  that  the
grantor had such intent. In this case, the landowner's statement, “Then
it's yours,” supports that presumption.

An  attempt  to  make  a  gift  that  is  to  become  effective  only  after  the
donor's death may fail because it is essentially a testamentary gift that
does  not  meet  the  formal  requirements  for  wills.  A  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  landowner's  language  indicated  that  she
intended  the  transfer  of  an  interest  to  the  nephew  to  take  effect
immediately.  A  grantor's  possession  of  a  deed  may  raise  a
presumption that there has been no effective delivery. B is incorrect,
however, because the presumption may be rebutted by proof that there
was a delivery and that the grantee thereafter returned the deed to the
grantor  for  safekeeping  only.  When  consideration  is  an  issue,
detrimental reliance may take the place of the required consideration.
D  is  incorrect,  however,  since  a  deed  may  be  valid  without
consideration.

127. C The given statute is a “race-notice” type statute, in that it makes good
faith  and  prior  recording  conditions  for  a  subsequent  grantee's
priority.  Although  the  son  took  the  realty  in  good  faith,  he  did  not
record before the bank. The bank's interest is therefore superior to the
son's.

An  interest  is  said  to  be  recorded  outside  the  chain  of  title  when  it
was recorded in a way that would have prevented the reasonable title
searcher  from  discovering  it.  In  most  jurisdictions,  an  interest
recorded  outside  the  chain  of  title  is  regarded  as  not  having  been
recorded at all. Under the given statute, however, the first interest has
priority so long as it was recorded before the subsequent interest was
recorded.  Since  the  son's  interest  was  recorded  two  days  after  the
bank's, and since there was no reason why a title searcher would not
have  discovered  the  bank's  interest  at  that  time,  A  is  incorrect.

881

Although  the  statute's  “good  faith”  requirement  is  probably  satisfied
by  the  fact  that  the  son  lacked  actual  or  constructive  notice  of  the
bank's  interest  at  the  time  the  land  was  conveyed  to  him,  B  is
incorrect because the statute imposes the additional requirement that
the  subsequent  interest  be  recorded  before  the  earlier  one.  Most
“notice” and “race-notice” statutes establish the payment of value as a
condition  of  the  junior  claimant's  priority.  A  careful  reading  of  this
statute will show that it does not, however. D is therefore incorrect.

128. D If a person without ownership purports to convey an estate that he or
she  does  not  have,  and  he  or  she  subsequently  acquires  title  to  that
estate, the doctrine of estoppel prevents the grantor from asserting his
or  her  title  against  his  or  her  grantee  and  causes  the  after-acquired
title to pass directly to the grantee by operation of law.

Since  the  covenants  made  by  the  landowner  were  breached  only  by
the landowner's delivery of a deed purporting to convey title that he
did  not  have,  and  since  only  his  grantee  could  sue  for  damages
resulting  from  such  breach,  the  landowner's  covenants  to  the  lawyer
are not relevant in the doctor's action. A is therefore incorrect. B is
incorrect  because 
lawyer  are
the  doctor's  rights  against 
independent  of  any  rights  that  the  lawyer  may  have  against  the
landowner. Thus, the existence of an effective remedy that the lawyer
can exercise against the landowner is not in itself sufficient to entitle
the  doctor  to  the  relief  he  seeks  from  the  lawyer.  Although  the
lawyer's  intention  may  have  been  to  convey  Northacre  to  the  doctor
on June 15, he was incapable of doing so at that time since he had not
received  title  to  Northacre  from  the  landowner.  For  this  reason,  the
lawyer's  conveyance  to  the  doctor  could  not  have  conveyed  an
interest  in  Northacre,  no  matter  what  the  lawyer  intended.  C  is
therefore incorrect.

the 

129. C  An  executory  interest  is  a  grantee's  future  interest  in  land  that  will
become  possessory  upon  the  termination  of  a  prior  estate,  which
termination  is  not  inevitable.  If  the  executory  interest  replaces  the
interest  of  another  grantee,  it  is  a  shifting  interest.  Since  the
termination of the nephew's and the niece's interests in Redacre is not
inevitable,  Sunrise  Foundation  holds  an  executory  interest.  Since  its
interest  will  replace  that  of  the  nephew  or  the  niece,  it  is  a  shifting
executory interest.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  a  remainder  is  a  future  interest  that

882

will become possessory upon the termination of a prior estate, which
termination is inevitable, and the terminations of the nephew's and the
niece's interests in Redacre are not inevitable. D is incorrect because
a springing interest is one that does not become presently possessory
until sometime after the natural termination of the previous estate.

130. A  An  assignee  of  a  tenant's  rights  under  a  lease  is  in  privity  of  estate
with  the  landlord  and  is  therefore  liable  for  rent  accrued  during  the
period of his or her possession. If he or she personally assumes the
obligations  of  the  lease,  he  or  she  is  also  liable  for  rent  accrued
before the assignment went into effect and after it terminates. Since, in
his agreement with the tenant, the store owner personally assumed the
obligations  of  the  lease,  he  is  personally  liable  for  rent  accrued
throughout the entire duration of the lease. Although the landlord was
not a party to this agreement, he can enforce it as an intended creditor
third-party beneficiary.

By collecting from subsequent assignees, a landlord does not waive
the right to collect rent from an assignor who is obligated to pay it. B
is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  landlord  was  a
third-party  beneficiary  of  the  contract  between  the  store  owner  and
the  tenant  and  can  therefore  enforce  the  promise  made  by  the  store
owner.  Because  the  store  owner  agreed  to  personally  assume  the
obligations of the lease, he was obligated to pay all sums due under
it. Since the obligation to pay rent under a lease does not depend on
whether the lessee is in possession of the premises, the store owner is
liable  for  all  rent  that  accrued  throughout  the  duration  of  the  lease
whether he was in possession of the premises or not. D is therefore
incorrect.

131.  C  If  the  homeowner's  easement  preexisted  the  landowner's  grant,  it
could  not  be  said  that  the  Church  of  the  Lord  permitted  a  use  other
than for church purposes since it had no power to do otherwise. Since
the  landowner's  right  was  to  become  possessory  only  if  the  church
permitted  use  other  than  for  church  purposes,  this  argument  might
defeat  the  landowner's  claim.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court
would  come  to  this  conclusion,  C  is  the  only  argument  listed  that
might support the church's position.

A is incorrect because if the church permitted use of the property for
other than church purposes, thus violating the limitation contained in
the grant, then the interest of the Church of the Lord would terminate,

883

even though there may have been sound motivation for its conduct. It
may  be  true  that  the  language  of  the  deed  created  a  fee  simple
determinable. B is incorrect, however, because this conclusion would
result in the termination of the Church of the Lord's interest. Although
the  landowner's  interest  under  the  deed  will  not  necessarily  vest
within  the  period  prescribed  by  the  Rule  Against  Perpetuities,  D  is
incorrect  because  the  Rule  Against  Perpetuities  does  not  apply  to  a
future interest of the grantor.

132.  D  One  who  assumes  an  existing  mortgage  when  purchasing  realty
personally undertakes to pay the note that the mortgage secures and is
thus  personally  liable  for  payments  on  the  note.  Subsequent  sales  of
the  realty,  even  to  other  purchasers  who  “assume”  the  mortgage,  do
not relieve prior obligors of personal obligations that they agreed to
assume.  Since  the  homeowner  promised  to  pay  (by  executing  the
initial note), she continues to be personally liable. Since the first and
second  buyer  promised  to  pay  (by  assuming  the  mortgage),  they
continue to be personally liable.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

133. C Although the most common forms of description involve reference to
metes and bounds, artificial and natural markers, government survey
markers, or property address, any method of description is sufficient
if  it  establishes  the  identity  of  the  realty  conveyed  with  reasonable
clarity. Since it is a famous piece of property, the description appears
to identify the realty conveyed with reasonable clarity.

A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

134.  B  An  easement  appurtenant  is  an  easement  benefiting  a  particular
dominant  estate.  The  original  deed  created  an  easement  appurtenant
because  the  beach  rights  were  clearly  intended  to  benefit  house
purchasers  based  on  their  ownership  of  realty  near  the  beach.
Easements  appurtenant  are  freely  alienable  and  usually  transferred
with a conveyance of the dominant estate. Importantly, both the benefit
and  burden  of  an  easement  appurtenant  pass  when  property  is
transferred.  Here,  the  benefit  passed  when  the  man  sold  the  woman
the house, and the burden passed when the development company sold
the golf course the beach.

A  is  incorrect  because  both  the  man's  and  the  woman's  use  of  the
beach  was  by  permission.  C is  incorrect  because  it  does  not  matter

884

whether the current owner of the beach created the original deed. D is
incorrect because the deed did not have to specifically state that the
beach rights were transferable.

135. C  Under  the  existing  reasonable  use  doctrine,  when  it  is  necessary  to
determine which riparian owner is entitled to water that is in limited
supply, the courts consider many factors. Most important, however, is
the use to which each owner puts the water. Although agricultural use
is  considered  “higher”  than  most  other  uses,  domestic  or  household
use  is  universally  acknowledged  to  be  the  “highest”  use  of  all,
entitling it to priority over all other uses. Since the choice to be made
is  between  the  landowner's  agricultural  use  and  the  homeowner's
household use, the homeowner's rights will prevail.

A  is  incorrect  because  upstream  owners  do  not  ordinarily  have
greater  rights  than  downstream  owners.  B  is  incorrect  because
household  use  is  a  higher  use  than  agricultural  use.  D  is  incorrect
because with the retreat from the natural flow doctrine, downstream
owners do not have greater rights than upstream owners.

136. C Ordinarily, if a covenant would have been enforceable as between the
covenanting parties, it is enforceable by and against their successors
if it runs with the land. A covenant is said to run with the land if the
covenanting parties intended that it would bind their successors, if the
covenant touches and concerns the land involved, and if the necessary
privity exists between the covenanting parties and between the parties
by  and  against  whom  enforcement  is  sought.  The  language  of  the
covenant, “for themselves, their heirs, successors, and assigns,” is the
language  traditionally  used  to  indicate  that  the  parties  intended  that
their  successors  be  bound.  Here,  the  covenant  touches  and  concerns
the  land.  The  necessary  privity  existed  between  the  farmer  and  the
first  buyer  because  they  were  grantor  and  grantee.  The  necessary
privity  exists  between  the  farmer  and  the  second  buyer  because  the
second  buyer  succeeded  to  the  first  buyer's  interest.  For  these
reasons, the covenant contained in the farmer's deed to the first buyer
runs with the land, thus binding the second buyer. Although covenants
running with the land are usually enforceable only at law (i.e.,  by  a
judgment  for  damages),  they  may  be  enforceable  as  equitable
servitudes  (i.e.,  by  injunction)  if  money  damages  would  not  be  an
adequate  remedy.  Since  it  was  the  farmer's  intention  to  create  a
residential community, the presence of a gas station would probably

885

interfere  with  the  residential  character  of  the  community  and  money
damages would not prevent this from happening, the remedy at law is
probably  not  adequate  and  the  covenant  is  probably  enforceable  by
injunction as an equitable servitude.

This is true whether or not the farmer succeeds in selling the rest of
the  subdivision.  Some  cases  hold  that  when  passage  of  time  and
change of circumstances make restrictive covenants fail of their initial
purpose, they may cease to be of effect. Perhaps this could eventually
lead a court to find that the restriction, obviously designed to protect
the residential nature of the subdivision, is unenforceable because the
neighborhood  is  not  really  residential  in  nature.  A  is  incorrect,
however, because six months is not a sufficiently long period of time
to  justify  such  a  conclusion.  Equitable  servitudes  may  be  enforced
against successors to the covenantor even though they did not agree to
be bound by them. This is particularly so where recording of the deed
gives  those  successors  constructive  notice  of  the  existence  of  the
restriction. B is therefore incorrect. If the covenant runs with the land,
it is enforceable against the second buyer whether or not his violation
of it will result in actual damage. If the covenant does not run with the
land,  it  is  not  enforceable  against  the  second  buyer,  even  if  its
violation  would  result  in  actual  damage.  For  this  reason,  D  is
incorrect.

137. A An assignment occurs when the tenant transfers to a third person all
his or her rights, title, and interest in the leased premises. An assignee
comes  into  privity  of  estate  with  the  landlord.  Importantly,  if  rent  is
not  paid,  the  landlord  may  sue  the  assignee  so  long  as  the  assignee
remains  on  the  premises.  However,  the  landlord  may  not  sue  the
assignee  after  the  assignee  has  transferred  the  premises  to  a  third
party unless the assignee has assumed the duty to pay rent. Here, the
third  lessee  did  not  agree  to  be  personally  liable  for  all  obligations
under the lease, and he assigned the balance of the lease to the fourth
lessee and no longer remained in possession.

B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

138. A A tenant's obligation to pay rent is not terminated if the tenant chooses
to vacate the premises before the expiration of the lease term unless
the landlord re-lets the premises on the tenant's account. However, a
landlord  is  not  required  to  do  so.  Consequently,  since  the  property
remained vacant, the woman still owes three months rent.

886

B and D are incorrect because the lease called for payment in money
(“$1,000 per month”) and the lessor would not be required to accept
payment  in  any  other  form.  No  matter  how  the  garage  is  valued,  the
landlord  would  not  be  obligated  to  accept  it  in  lieu  of  money.  C  is
incorrect  because  conveyance  of  land  to  a  buyer  does  not  relieve  a
tenant  of  the  obligation  to  pay  rent.  Normally,  the  grantor  of  leased
property assigns the grantee the right to receive the rents. However, if
this right is not passed to the grantee, the tenant must keep paying rent
to the original lessor. Consequently, the change in ownership does not
change the woman's obligation to pay rent to someone (making A the
best answer).

139.  A  Marketable  title  is  title  that  a  well-informed,  reasonably  prudent
buyer  would  be  willing  to  accept.  Because  a  reasonably  prudent
buyer would not want to buy a lawsuit, any doubt about the title held
by the landowner would make the title unmarketable. Here, the man's
possible adverse possession claim puts the landowner's title in doubt.
Therefore,  since  the  contract  required  the  landowner  to  deliver
marketable  title,  the  landlord  would  be  in  breach.  Therefore,  D  is
incorrect.

B is  incorrect  because  the  issue  is  the  possible  adverse  possession
claim, not any recording statute. C is incorrect because an insurance
policy  would  only  protect  against  economic  losses  cause  by  the
landowner's  failure  to  deliver  good  title.  Importantly,  it  would  not
make the title marketable.

140. C Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must
vest, if at all, during a period measured by a life or lives in being plus
21  years.  Since  liquor  might  be  sold  on  the  premises  after  the
expiration  of  this  period,  it  is  possible  that  the  interest  of  the
Foundation  for  Heart  Diseases  would  vest  beyond  the  period  of
perpetuities. For this reason, it received no valid interest.

The  future  interest  of  a  charity  is  not  subject  to  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities if it follows the estate of another charity. Otherwise, the
Rule Against Perpetuities applies as it would to any other grantee. A
is incorrect because there is no indication that the friend is a charity.
B is incorrect because only a grantor can hold a right of reentry. An
executory interest is a future interest that follows an estate that is not
certain  to  terminate.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  interest  of  the
Foundation for Heart Diseases is void as explained above.

887

141.  C  The  contract  provided  for  the  sale  of  “all  the  realty.”  Realty  is
generally defined as land or anything permanently attached to the land
or non-moveable property. A fixture is a chattel that has become part
of the realty. In deciding whether a chattel is a fixture that has become
part  of  the  realty,  courts  usually  look  to  the  intention  of  the  parties.
Here, both the artist and the landowner never considered the machine
part  of  the  property,  so  C  is  the  best  answer.  Therefore,  A  is
incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  although  courts  consider  the  movability  of  a
chattel when considering whether it is a fixture, courts usually make a
determination based on party intent. Although the size of the machine
likely  made  it  hard  to  move,  it  wasn't  necessarily  immovable.  D  is
incorrect because the determination of whether something is a fixture
is not based solely on whether it is attached to the realty.

142. C Ordinarily, a co-tenant has a right to occupy and possess the premises
without being required to account to other co-tenants for rent. A co-
tenant who has ousted another co-tenant or prevented him or her from
occupying the premises may be required to account for profits and the
reasonable value of rent, however.

A  contains  a  familiar  phrase,  but  it  is  not  related  in  any  way  to  the
rights  and  obligations  that  arise  from  co-tenancy.  B  is  incorrect
because a co-tenant is not obligated to sell his or her interest, and no
new  obligations  arise  from  his  or  her  failure  to  do  so.  The
construction  of  permanent  buildings  on  the  land  may  increase  the
value of the interests of other co-tenants but does not obligate the co-
tenant who builds them to account for rent. D is therefore incorrect.

143. D  Under  the  doctrine  of  estoppel  by  deed,  one  who  conveys  realty  in
which he or she has no interest is estopped from denying the validity
of the conveyance if he or she then acquires the realty. Here, although
the farmer did not own the land at the time of the purported sale to the
builder, the fact that he later acquired the land through the developer's
reconveyance means he is now estopped from denying the sale to the
builder. Therefore, A is incorrect.

B is incorrect because compliance or non-compliance with recording
statutes does not relate to a grantee's rights against the grantor. Here,
the builder is the grantee and the farmer is the grantor. C is incorrect
because fraud alone is not sufficient to result in a ruling that title has

888

passed.

144. A  A  person  acquires  title  to  land  by  adverse  possession  if  he  or  she
possesses  the  land  with  use  that  is  open,  notorious,  hostile,  and
continuous  for  the  statutory  period.  A  temporary  absence  does  not
break  the  adverse  possessor's  continuity  of  possession  if  it  is
consistent  with  the  adverse  possessor's  claim.  However,  if  the
absence is inconsistent with the adverse possessor's claim, it breaks
continuity  of  possession.  Here,  the  landowner  “forcing”  the  man  to
move  is  clearly  inconsistent  with  his  claim.  Consequently,  even
though he was only gone for a month, the man's period of possession
was broken and he has only had continuity of possession for 16 years.

B  is  incorrect.  Adverse  possession  requires  that  the  adverse
possessor's  use  be  hostile.  Consequently,  the  landowner's  failure  to
give  permission  to  the  man  would  actually  help  the  man's  adverse
possession claim. C is incorrect because there is no requirement that
removal  be  by  court  order.  D  is  incorrect  because  even  temporary
removals  can  break  continuity  of  possession  if  they  are  inconsistent
with the adverse possessor's use.

TORTS QUESTIONS

1. The manufacturer made a product that was sold over the counter for the
treatment of dandruff and dry scalp conditions. A doctor purchased a
bottle at a drugstore. A statement on the label read, “This product will
not harm normal scalp or hair.” The doctor used the product as
directed. Because of a rare scalp condition making him allergic to one
of the ingredients, the product irritated his scalp, causing him much
pain and discomfort. In an action for negligence by the doctor against
the manufacturer, which of the following additional facts or inferences,
if it was the only one true, would be most effective in the
manufacturer's defense?

(A) The doctor did not read the statement on the label.

(B) The reasonable person in the manufacturer's position would not
have foreseen that the product would injure persons with the
doctor's allergy.

(C) The product was manufactured for the manufacturer by another

company.

(D) The manufacturer was unaware that an allergy existed like that

suffered by the doctor.

2. The defendant lived in a neighborhood in which the incidence of

violent crime had been increasing. The plaintiff and the defendant were
having tea together in the defendant's kitchen when there was a knock at
the door of the defendant's home. Although the door was equipped with
a peephole that would have enabled the defendant to see who was

893

outside before opening, the defendant opened the door without looking.
As soon as the door was opened, an armed robber entered with a gun.
The robber struck the plaintiff several times with the barrel of his
pistol before robbing her of her money and leaving. The plaintiff
subsequently asserted a negligence claim against the defendant for
injuries resulting from the attack, alleging that it was negligent for the
defendant to open the door without looking to see who was there.

Which of the following additional facts, if it was the only one true,
would be most helpful to the plaintiff's claim against the defendant?

(A) The defendant was aware of the high incidence of crime in the

neighborhood.

(B) The plaintiff was aware of the high incidence of crime in the

neighborhood.

(C) The defendant had invited the plaintiff for tea because she hoped to

sell the plaintiff her used living room furniture.

(D) One of the defendant's neighbors had been robbed and attacked by

the robber in a similar manner the previous day.

3. A farmer advertised his farm for sale. A developer had been secretly

advised by a friend in the state highway department that a major
highway would soon be built adjacent to the farmer's land. Knowing
that this would increase the value of the property, the developer
contacted the farmer and offered to purchase the farm. The developer
said that she would be willing to pay the fair market value as
determined by any licensed real estate appraiser selected by the
farmer. The farmer hired a licensed real estate appraiser who
determined the fair market value to be $400,000. The developer
purchased the land, paying that price. Under state law, the developer
was required to tell the farmer about the new road, but she failed to do
so.

Three weeks after the closing of title, the state announced plans to
build a highway adjacent to the land. This announcement increased the
value of the land to $4,000,000. If the farmer institutes an action for
misrepresentation against the developer, the court should find for

(A) the developer, because the farmer knew her to be a real estate

investor.

894

(B) the developer, because she allowed the farmer's appraiser to

determine the fair market value of the land.

(C) the farmer, because the developer's failure to disclose the coming

of the highway was a breach of a fiduciary obligation.

(D) the farmer, because the developer had an obligation to disclose that

the state would be building a highway adjacent to the land.

4. A woman was injured when a robber shot her with a pistol

manufactured by the gun maker. She asserted a claim against the gun
maker, alleging that the pistol with which she had been shot was meant
to be sold for a price under $50. Which of the following arguments is
most likely to lead to a judgment for the woman?

(A) The gun maker is vicariously liable for battery, since it was

foreseeable that a purchaser of the pistol would shoot another
person with it.

(B) The gun maker breached an implied warranty that the gun was

merchantable, since a pistol that is meant to be sold for under $50
is unfit for ordinary use.

(C) The gun maker is liable for negligence, since the criminal law is

designed to protect persons like the woman from becoming the
victims of robbers.

(D) The gun maker is liable for negligence, since the low selling price

of the pistol made it foreseeable that it would be used in
connection with a crime.

5. A man was already intoxicated when he entered the bartender's tavern.
At first, the bartender refused to serve him any more alcohol. The man
insisted, however, and at his insistence, the bartender served him more
drinks. When the man left the bar, he was unable to start his car. He
asked a dentist, who was driving by, to assist him. The dentist, who
realized that the man was drunk, determined that the man's battery was
weak and started the man's car by connecting a cable to her own
battery. Later, while driving, the man struck a pedestrian who was
walking across the street.

The pedestrian asserted a claim for his personal injuries against the
dentist. Which one of the following facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would provide the dentist with the most effective
defense?

895

(A) The state had a statute making a barkeeper liable for damage done
by a person who purchased alcohol from the barkeeper after
already being intoxicated.

(B) The dentist was in the business of rendering road service to

motorists having trouble with their cars.

(C) The man drove 200 miles before striking the pedestrian.

(D) The man would not have struck the pedestrian if he had not been

intoxicated.

6. The driver was driving at an unreasonably fast rate of speed when, as a

result, he collided with a hunter's car that was standing unattended
against the curb. The impact caused a loaded rifle that the hunter had
left in the back seat of the car to fire. The bullet went through the car
window and traveled four blocks before striking a painter, who was
leaving a paint factory after work. Although the painter had lost the
sight in his left eye in an accident that occurred when he was a child,
he was employed by the paint factory as a color coordinator. As a
result of his being struck by the bullet from the hunter's rifle, the painter
lost the sight in his right eye. This rendered him totally blind, causing
him to lose his job. The painter subsequently asserted a negligence
claim against the driver, alleging permanent loss of earning capacity in
addition to other items of damage.

Which of the following is the driver's most effective argument in
defense against the painter's claim for permanent loss of earning
capacity?

(A) The painter was a super-sensitive plaintiff, since he was already

blind in one eye.

(B) The hunter acted unreasonably by leaving a loaded rifle in the back

seat of his car.

(C) The painter was outside the foreseeable zone of danger.

(D) The reasonable person would not have expected that the driver's

conduct would cause any person to be rendered blind.

7. A burglar broke into the grocer's grocery store in the middle of the
night. After stealing all the money that was in the cash register, she
blew open the door of the safe with nitroglycerin and stole its contents
as well. Then, as she was leaving, she stole a six-pack of beer.

896

Because of poor quality control at the brewery, the beer contained a
toxic ingredient. Later that night, the burglar drank the beer and was
made seriously ill by the toxic ingredient that it contained. In an action
by the burglar against the brewery, the court will most likely find for

(A) the burglar, because her injury was proximately caused by the

negligence of the brewery.

(B) the burglar, since the brewery breached an express warranty.

(C) the brewery, since the burglar does not come into court with “clean

hands.”

(D) the brewery, because the burglar's theft of the beer will be regarded

as unforeseeable.

8. A movie studio was filming part of a motion picture at a large

residential apartment building with the permission of the building
owner. To avoid interference by curious onlookers, the movie studio's
security agents set up a command post in the lobby of the building. No
persons were allowed to enter the building without identifying
themselves and explaining their reasons for being there. A fisherman,
who lived in an apartment in the building, was returning from a fishing
trip late one night. Unaware of the movie studio's activities, he was
stopped by the movie studio employees as he attempted to enter.
Because he was not carrying identification, the fisherman was unable
to establish his identity. For this reason, the employees refused to
allow him to enter. After trying unsuccessfully to convince them that he
lived there, the fisherman stayed with his sister, who lived a block
away. The following morning, he contacted the building owner, who
spoke to the movie studio officials and arranged to have them allow the
fisherman to enter.

If the fisherman asserts a claim against the movie studio for false
imprisonment, which of the following would be the movie studio's
most effective argument in defense?

(A) The movie studio employees did not know that the fisherman was

entitled to enter the building.

(B) The conduct of the movie studio employees was not unreasonable.

(C) The fisherman was not imprisoned.

(D) The fisherman sustained no damage as a result of the conduct of the

897

movie studio employees.

9. A handyman, who owned an appliance repair shop, was at a cocktail

party when he saw one of his competitors. When the handyman
suggested that they work together, the competitor responded, “I
wouldn't go into business with you because you're the most
incompetent person I've ever known.” A customer of the handyman's
overheard the conversation. As a result, the following day the customer
cancelled a contract that he had with the handyman.

If the handyman asserts a claim against the competitor for defamation,
the handyman will be successful if

(A) the competitor knew or should have known that the statement was

defamatory when he made it.

(B) the competitor knew or should have known that the statement was

false when he made it.

(C) the competitor knew or should have known that the statement would

be overheard when he made it.

(D) the competitor knew or should have known that harm would result

from the statement.

10. A farmer agreed to deliver all of her wheat to a bread company to be

used by that company in the production of bread for sale to the general
public. While harvesting the crop, she realized that a blade on her
harvesting machine was broken and that fine slivers of metal were
becoming mixed with the wheat. She said nothing about this when she
delivered the wheat to the bread company since she knew that the
bread company ordinarily cleaned its wheat before using it. The
harvesting machine had been manufactured and sold by a tractor
company.

The bread company used the wheat that it purchased from the farmer to
manufacture a loaf of bread that it sold to a deli owner who operated a
sandwich shop. The deli owner used the bread to make a sandwich.
Because the bread contained slivers of the blade from the farmer's
harvesting machine, a bike messenger lacerated the lining of his throat
when he swallowed a bite of the sandwich.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most helpful to the farmer in defense against

898

an action brought by the bike messenger on a theory of strict liability
in tort?

(A) If the bread company acted reasonably, the slivers of metal would
have been removed from the wheat before it was baked into bread.

(B) The sandwich that contained the slivers of metal had been

purchased by one of the bike messenger's coworkers, who gave it
to the bike messenger after changing his mind about eating it.

(C) The bread company made substantial changes to the wheat.

(D) The blade on the farmer's harvesting machine was defective when

she purchased it from the tractor company.

11. The plaintiff and the defendant were drinking at the same bar when the
plaintiff began insulting the defendant by calling him names that were
ethnically offensive. When they started to argue with each other, the
bartender asked them both to leave. The plaintiff got into his car and
drove away. Angry, the defendant began chasing him in his own car.
When he caught up with the plaintiff, the defendant began passing the
plaintiff's car on the left. As he did so, he swerved his car toward the
plaintiff's for the purpose of frightening the plaintiff. The plaintiff did
not know that the car swerving toward him was the defendant's, but he
became frightened that it would hit him and steered away from it,
striking a fire hydrant and sustaining injury.

If the plaintiff institutes an action against the defendant, a court should
hold the defendant liable for

(A) battery only.

(B) assault only.

(C) both battery and assault.

(D) neither battery nor assault.

12. The buyer was interested in purchasing the seller's house. Because the
buyer knew that some of the houses in the area were infested with
termites, he asked the seller whether there were any termites in his
house. The seller said that there were none, believing this statement to
be true. The buyer purchased the house from the seller and moved into
it. Three months later, the buyer discovered that the framework of the
house had been damaged by termites, and that the termites had been
damaging the framework for several years. He subsequently asserted a

899

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

claim against the seller on a theory of negligent misrepresentation.

Which of the following is the seller's most effective argument in
defense against the buyer's claim?

(A) The seller did not know that there were termites in the house.

(B) The seller had no duty to tell the buyer whether there were termites

in the house.

(C) The seller's statement that there were no termites in the house was

an expression of opinion.

(D) The seller's belief that there were no termites in the house was

reasonable.

13. The plaintiff purchased a box labeled “Generic Breakfast Cereal” from
a supermarket. While he was eating it, he broke a tooth on a stone that
the product contained. The product sold by the supermarket and
labeled “Generic Breakfast Cereal” is furnished by three different
manufacturers. Each sells an approximately equal quantity to the
supermarket. In addition, all package their product in identical
wrappers, so that it is impossible to tell which of them furnished any
given box of breakfast cereal. Although the companies compete with
each other, at the supermarket's request, they worked together to design
the product wrapper.

If the plaintiff is successful in an action for damages against the
supermarket, it will probably be because

(A) the supermarket and manufacturers were involved in a concerted

action in the manufacture and marketing of the product.

(B) the supermarket and manufacturers established standards on an
industry-wide basis, which standards made identification of the
product's manufacturer impossible.

(C) the negligence of any of the three manufacturers resulted in harm to
the plaintiff under circumstances such that it was impossible to tell
which of them caused the harm, and the supermarket is vicariously
liable for that negligence.

(D) any of the three manufacturers manufactured a defective product,
and the supermarket sold that product while it was in a defective
condition.

14. A young girl planned to spend an entire weekend camping alone in the
woods. A kidnapper, who knew about the girl's plan, phoned the girl's
mother the day after the girl left home. The kidnapper said, “We have
your daughter. We've already beaten her up once, just to hear her
scream. Next time, we might kill her.” The kidnapper instructed the
girl's mother to deliver a cash ransom to a specified location within
one hour. Since there was no way to locate the girl's campsite in the
woods, the girl's mother could not find out whether the kidnapper was
telling the truth. Horrified that her daughter might be beaten and injured
or killed, she delivered the ransom as instructed. She remained in a
hysterical state until the girl returned from her camping trip and the
girl's mother realized that the ransom demand had been a hoax. The
girl's mother, who already suffered from a heart ailment, had a heart
attack the day after the girl's return.

If the girl's mother asserts a claim against the kidnapper for assault, the
court should find for

(A) the girl's mother, because the kidnapper was aware that his conduct

would frighten her.

(B) the girl's mother, because the court will transfer the kidnapper's

intent.

(C) the kidnapper, because the girl's mother did not perceive injury

being inflicted upon the girl.

(D) the kidnapper, because the girl's mother had no reason to expect to

be touched by the kidnapper.

15. An actor owned a leopard, which the actor had trained and which had
appeared with him in motion pictures. The leopard had always been
tame and gentle, even when young. When the actor retired, the leopard
was old, almost blind, somewhat slow-moving, and the size of a large
dog. The actor brought the animal to live with him, keeping it in the
fenced yard alongside his house. A young girl delivered newspapers to
the actor. One day, she came to the actor's home to collect for the past
week's deliveries. Since she knew the leopard, the girl opened the gate
and called the animal so that she could pet him. The leopard bounded
toward the place from which the sound had come, but because he was
almost blind, he bumped into the girl. The girl fell to the ground,
fracturing her ankle.

901

If the girl asserts a claim against the actor on a theory of strict liability,
the court should find for

(A) the actor, because the injury did not result from a trait that made it

dangerous to keep a leopard.

(B) the actor, because the leopard was not a wild animal.

(C) the girl, because it was unreasonable for the actor to keep the

leopard in his yard.

(D) the girl, because the actor should have anticipated that a child

would attempt to pet the leopard.

16. While the plaintiff was visiting her daughter, the two of them decided
to go swimming at a nearby public pool. Since she had not brought a
bathing suit along on her visit, the plaintiff went to a department store
to purchase one. While looking at the suits on the bargain counter, she
found one that had been manufactured by the defendant. The package
that contained it bore a label that read, “Disposable Bathing Suit. This
garment is made completely from recycled paper. Although it is strong
enough to be worn several times and is even washable, it's inexpensive
enough to be thrown away after one use. Buy several, and take them
with you on trips to the beach.” The plaintiff bought the bathing suit and
wore it at the public swimming pool. After swimming for a few
minutes, the wet paper bathing suit suddenly dissolved and fell from
her in shreds, leaving her completely naked.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from her embarrassment, the defendant's best argument in
defense is that

(A) the defendant made no representations to the plaintiff.

(B) the plaintiff sustained no physical injury or symptoms.

(C) the plaintiff purchased the suit from the department store.

(D) the defendant acted reasonably in manufacturing and labeling the

bathing suit.

17. A mother needed butter for the cookies that she was baking, so she

asked her seven-year-old son to go to the store. Because traffic was
sometimes heavy, the boy was not usually permitted to ride his bicycle
on the roadway there. The mother needed the butter right away,
however, so she told him that he could ride in the roadway if he was

902

sure to stay on the left side. A driver was driving his car when he was
momentarily blinded by the sun. He did not see the boy, who was
riding toward him in the roadway, and struck him, causing the boy to
sustain serious injuries. The boy subsequently asserted a claim for
negligence against the driver. The driver raised a defense based on
contributory negligence. In a jurisdiction that applies the all-or-nothing
rule of contributory negligence, the driver's defense will succeed only
if

(A) the boy acted unreasonably.

(B) the mother acted unreasonably.

(C) either the mother or the boy acted unreasonably.

(D) both the mother and the boy acted unreasonably.

18. A company manufactured a leash for training dogs. The leash had been

submitted to all reasonable tests and inspections before being
marketed. A professional dog trainer was working with a dog in her
unfenced front yard and was using a brand new leash. The dog was of
average size and strength. A walker was walking past the yard when
the dog began to snarl and lunge at him. When the trainer yanked on the
leash, it suddenly broke, freeing the dog. The dog sprang forward,
biting the walker.

If the walker asserts a claim against the company alleging that the
leash used by the trainer was defective, the court should find for

(A) the company, because the walker was not a purchaser or consumer

of the product.

(B) the company, because the leash had been submitted to all
reasonable tests and inspections before being marketed.

(C) the walker, because the dog was a dog of average size and strength.

(D) the walker, because it was foreseeable that the leash would

eventually weaken and break when used as it was meant to be used.

19. On a boy's first birthday, his aunt bought him a rag doll as a gift. The
toy was made of plush material, with buttons sewn on for eyes. While
playing with the toy, the boy pulled one of the buttons off, put it in his
mouth, and choked to death on it. The boy's father commenced an
action against the aunt under the state's wrongful death statute.

903

If the father is successful in his action against the aunt, it will probably
be because

(A) the aunt was negligent in giving the rag doll to the boy.

(B) the rag doll was unfit for ordinary use.

(C) the rag doll was defective when the aunt gave it to the boy.

(D) the rag doll was unreasonably dangerous when the aunt gave it to

the boy.

20. Because the plaintiff had a headache, he took two headache tablets

from a bottle that had been purchased by his wife at the grocery store.
The tablets had been manufactured by the company, which sold them to
the grocery store in sealed bottles for resale. Because of a toxic
ingredient that the tablets contained, the plaintiff became ill as a result
of taking them.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim based on negligence against the grocery
store for his damages, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the company's negligence is imputed to the

grocery store.

(B) the plaintiff, because a retailer has an absolute duty to provide safe

products.

(C) the grocery store, because the bottle containing the tablets was

sealed when the grocery store received it.

(D) the grocery store, because the tablets had been purchased by the

plaintiff's wife.

21. A driver was looking for an address as he drove down the street and
was not watching the road in front of him. As a result, he did not see
the pedestrian crossing the street in front of him and struck her with his
car, knocking her down. The driver immediately got out of his car to
help the pedestrian. When he saw that she was unconscious, he became
afraid to move her, and he left her in the roadway while he ran to a
nearby phone. While the driver was gone, a taxi driver drove down the
same street. Because he was intoxicated by the drug PCP, the taxi
driver did not see the pedestrian in the roadway and drove over her,
fracturing her leg.

If the pedestrian brings an action against the taxi driver for damages

904

resulting from her fractured leg, the taxi driver's liability will most
probably turn on whether it was foreseeable that

(A) the driver would drive negligently and would leave the pedestrian

lying in the roadway after striking her.

(B) a person struck by an automobile would be involved in a second

accident within a short period of time.

(C) a person would be in the roadway.

(D) the taxi driver would drive while intoxicated by the drug PCP.

22. The power company operated a nuclear power plant on the seashore
just outside the city and sold electricity generated by its operations to
city residents. To cool its equipment, the power company drew water
from the ocean and piped it through portions of its plant. Because this
operation made the water highly radioactive, the power company
stored used water in a series of large concrete holding ponds. The
water stored in this fashion was subjected to a series of procedures
designed to “neutralize” it by removing the radioactivity before it was
returned to the ocean. Because of an earthquake, one of the concrete
holding ponds cracked, permitting several million gallons of
neutralized water to escape. Although the escaping water was not
radioactive, it caused substantial damage to the fields of a farmer as it
passed over them.

If the farmer asserts a claim against the power company for damage to
his realty, the court should find for

(A) the farmer, because operating a nuclear power plant is an

abnormally dangerous activity.

(B) the farmer, because water is a substance that is likely to do great

harm if it should escape from captivity.

(C) the farmer, because it was unreasonable to operate a nuclear power

plant in an area where an earthquake could occur.

(D) the power company, because the damage resulted from an Act of

God.

23. The company was a manufacturer of explosives. Its warehouse, which
contained large quantities of explosives, was located a short distance
from the town. A group of political extremists were planning to set off
a series of bombs in public places in the town. Several members broke

905

into the company's warehouse for the purpose of stealing explosives to
use in making bombs. Their entry set off an alarm that brought the
police. Rather than surrender to the police, the terrorists committed
suicide by detonating the explosives that they had stolen. The blast
caused the entire warehouse to explode. A house located a half mile
away was damaged by the explosion.

If the homeowner asserts a claim for damages against the company on
the ground that storing explosives was an abnormally dangerous
activity, which of the following would be the company's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) The explosion did not result from unreasonable conduct by the

company.

(B) The damage did not result from a physical invasion of the

homeowner's realty by any tangible object in the control of the
company.

(C) The conduct of the terrorists was an intervening cause of harm.

(D) It was not foreseeable that terrorists would deliberately detonate

explosives in the warehouse.

24. The seller kept an antique hay wagon in front of her house as a yard
ornament. On several occasions, she offered to sell the hay wagon to
her neighbor, the buyer, for $500. Although the buyer admired it, he had
always been unwilling to pay the seller's price. After reading a
magazine article about the increasing popularity of farm antiques, the
buyer concluded that the value of the seller's hay wagon was likely to
increase, and that it would therefore be a good investment. One day he
approached her, saying, “If you're still interested in selling that hay
wagon, I'll pay $500.” The seller was surprised that he had changed
his mind, but did not ask him why because she was afraid that he
would change it back again. Instead, she said, “I'll take your offer,” and
sold him the wagon. Two months later, an antique dealer who saw the
wagon in the buyer's yard bought it from him for $2,000.

If the seller asserts a misrepresentation claim against the buyer, the
court should find for

(A) the seller, because the buyer knew more about the value of antique

hay wagons than the seller did.

906

(B) the seller, because the buyer purchased the hay wagon for the

undisclosed purpose of profiting from his investment.

(C) the buyer, because he was not required to disclose his purpose in

purchasing the hay wagon.

(D) the buyer, because the seller was initially satisfied with the price

that the buyer paid her for the hay wagon.

25. A state statute provides that no person shall transport passengers for

hire in an airplane unless that person shall be licensed as a commercial
airplane pilot. A pilot owned a small private airplane but did not have
a commercial pilot's license. A businessman offered the pilot $200 to
fly him to a distant city in the pilot's plane. The pilot agreed, after
informing the businessman that he did not have a commercial pilot's
license as required by law. While they were flying over another city,
the pilot realized that he had miscalculated the amount of fuel that he
needed for the trip. As a result, he was forced to land at the other city's
airport. After landing and while waiting to be refueled, the pilot's
plane was struck by a plane that was being negligently operated by
another pilot. The first pilot and the businessman were both injured in
the collision. The jurisdiction applies the all-or-nothing rule of
contributory negligence.

The businessman asserted a claim against the first pilot, alleging that
the first pilot was negligent in miscalculating the quantity of fuel
needed to make the trip. Which of the following arguments would be
the first pilot's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The businessman assumed the risk, because he knew that the first

pilot did not have a commercial pilot's license.

(B) The businessman was contributorily negligent in accepting a ride

with the first pilot, whom he knew to be unlicensed.

(C) The first pilot's miscalculation was not a legal cause of the injury
sustained by the businessman, because the first pilot's plane was
safely on the ground when struck by the plane operated by the
second pilot.

(D) The first pilot's miscalculation was not a factual cause of the injury
sustained by the businessman, because the harm would not have
occurred if the second pilot had not been negligent.

26. A manufacturer made a colorless alcohol used by physicians for

907

cleaning the skin of patients before administering injections. Another of
its products was a red liquid for cleaning glass microscope slides used
in medical and research laboratories.

Because the slide cleaner contained a strong solvent that was
damaging to human skin, the label normally affixed to bottles in which
it was sold contained language advising users to wear rubber gloves
while handling the product.

As a result of an oversight at the company's plant, skin cleaner labels
were erroneously placed on several bottles of slide cleaner. One of
the mislabeled bottles was delivered to a doctor's office. In giving an
injection to a patient, the doctor used the slide cleaner, believing it to
be the skin cleaner. As a result, the patient sustained damage to his
skin.

In a negligence action by the patient against the manufacturer, if one of
the following facts or inferences were true, which would provide the
manufacturer with its strongest argument in defense?

(A) It was unforeseeable that a doctor with the doctor's training and

experience would mistake the chemicals, since they were two
different colors.

(B) If the doctor had been acting reasonably, she would have realized

that the product that she was using was not the skin cleaner, since it
was red instead of colorless.

(C) The doctor's failure to notice that the product that she was using

was red, and therefore was not the skin cleaner, amounted to gross
negligence.

(D) The doctor's conduct was an intervening cause of the patient's

injury.

27. Which of the following persons is most likely to recover in an action

against the manufacturer of a hypodermic needle?

(A) A doctor's child, who found the needle in the doctor's medical bag
and was injured when a defect caused it to break while the child
was playing with it.

(B) A doctor's patient, who was injured when a defect caused the
needle to break while the doctor was injecting him with it.

908

(C) A dentist, who lost profits when she was unable to inject a patient

with the needle because a defect caused it to break.

(D) A narcotics addict, who contracted hepatitis because the needle

was infected with the microbe that caused that disease.

28. A crop duster sprayed insecticides onto growing crops from an

airplane that she flew within 15 feet of the ground. In locating the
fields of her customers, she used a map that the county published for
that purpose and that identified every parcel of real estate in the area
by a parcel number. A farmer hired the crop duster to spray his fields
with insecticide. The farmer knew that his farm was identified on the
county map as parcel 612, but by mistake he told the crop duster that it
was parcel 621. As a result, the crop duster sprayed the farm that the
county map identified as parcel 621. That farm belonged to a gardener,
who had contracted to grow his crop without chemical insecticides and
to sell it to an organic produce distributor. As a result of the crop
duster's spraying, the gardener was unable to fulfill his contract and
sustained serious economic losses.

If the gardener asserts a claim against the crop duster for damages
resulting from trespass to land, the court should find for

(A) the gardener, because crop dusting is an abnormally dangerous

activity.

(B) the gardener, because the crop duster intentionally flew through the

airspace above his land.

(C) the crop duster, because she reasonably believed that the farm that

she was spraying belonged to the farmer.

(D) the crop duster, because there was no damage to the gardener's

land.

29. A state senator was chair of a committee looking into accusations of
corruption in the governor's office. Because reports of committee
agents were beginning to indicate that there was a sound basis for the
accusations, the senator kept them locked in her office safe to prevent
them from becoming public knowledge before the investigation could
be completed. A reporter broke into the senator's office, picked the
lock on her safe, and photographed the documents that it contained. The
following day, realizing that the security of the documents had been
compromised, the senator conducted a press conference in which she

909

made their contents known. Before she had completed the conference,
however, newspapers containing the reporter's story about the papers
in the senator's safe were being sold.

If the senator instituted an action against the reporter for invasion of
privacy, the court should find for

(A) the reporter, since the documents in the senator's safe were

newsworthy.

(B) the reporter, since he was protected by the First Amendment to the

United States Constitution.

(C) the reporter, since the senator made the documents a matter of

public record at the press conference.

(D) the senator, since the reporter entered her office without her

permission and broke into her safe.

30. A boy, who was 11 years of age, was playing with the plaintiff, who

was 10 years of age. While they were playing together, the boy offered
to show the plaintiff his new air rifle. The air rifle was manufactured
by a local company. The boy purchased it from the defendant with
money that he earned by mowing the lawns of several of his neighbors.
While demonstrating the air rifle to the plaintiff, the boy accidentally
shot him with it, severely injuring the plaintiff's eye. The plaintiff
subsequently asserted a negligence claim against the defendant.

If the plaintiff is successful in his claim against the defendant, it will
be because a jury finds that

(A) any negligence by the company in the design of the air rifle should

be imputed to the defendant.

(B) the air rifle was defectively designed.

(C) the air rifle was defectively manufactured.

(D) it was unreasonable for the defendant to sell the air rifle to the boy.

31. A car dealer used a mechanic for all of his auto repairs. He used the
mechanic because he was cheap, although the car dealer sometimes
had to send cars back for repairs three or four times until the mechanic
got it right. One of the car dealer's cars had a leaking carburetor, which
the car dealer knew made it unsafe to drive. He had it repaired by the
mechanic and then rented the car to the plaintiff. One hour later, while

910

the plaintiff was driving the car, the carburetor began leaking again. As
a result, the car exploded, injuring the plaintiff.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the car dealer, the plaintiff's most
effective argument in support of her claim would be that

(A) the car dealer is vicariously liable for the negligence of his

employee.

(B) the duty to maintain a safe car was non-delegable.

(C) the mechanic was an independent contractor.

(D) it was unreasonable for the car dealer to hire the mechanic to

repair the car.

32. Which statement most correctly completes the following sentence? A

retailer owes its customers

(A) no duty to inspect products furnished by reputable manufacturers.

(B) a duty to inspect the packages of all products sold, but no duty to

inspect the contents of those packages.

(C) a duty to inspect only those products that are furnished by

manufacturers whose products are not well known to the retailer.

(D) a duty to make a reasonable inspection of all products that are sold

by that retailer.

33. After an employee's resignation, the employer wrote him a letter in
which he said, “You were never any good as a mechanic, and in
addition, you were the most dishonest employee this company ever
had.” These statements were false. The employee's mother, who lived
with the employee and frequently opened his mail, read the letter as
soon as it arrived. In an action by the employee against the employer
for defamation, a court should find for

(A) the employee, because the employer's statements were published to

the employee's mother.

(B) the employee, only if the employer had reason to know that

someone other than the employee would open and read the letter.

(C) the employer, because the statements contained in the letter were

communicated only to the employee.

(D) the employer, because of the employer's privilege.

911

34. A pilot was injured when the helicopter that he was flying ran out of
fuel and fell from the air. The day after the pilot purchased the
helicopter, he noticed that the fuel gauge gave incorrect readings. He
complained to an officer of the helicopter maker, who told him to have
it fixed and to send the helicopter maker the bill. A week before the
accident, the pilot hired an independent mechanic to repair the fuel
gauge. The mechanic worked on the gauge but failed to repair it
properly. The day before the accident, the pilot's partner flew the
helicopter, using most of the fuel in the tank. Although the pilot's
partner noticed that the fuel gauge continued to indicate that the tank
was full, he neither mentioned it to the pilot nor replaced the fuel in the
tank. On the day of the accident, the fuel gauge indicated that the tank
was full, although it was actually almost empty.

If the pilot wishes to assert a claim for damages on a theory of strict
liability in tort, he is most likely to recover against

(A) the helicopter maker only.

(B) the helicopter maker and the pilot's partner only.

(C) the helicopter maker and the mechanic only.

(D) the helicopter maker, the pilot's partner, and the mechanic.

35. A gravel pit owner was aware of the fact that neighborhood children
used a steep slope on his realty for sledding during the snow season,
and he feared that one of the children would be injured by sledding
onto the public road adjacent to the property. Although he could have
prevented this from happening by erecting a small fence at a cost of
under $200, the gravel pit owner was unwilling to expend that sum.
Instead, he posted a sign that read, “No Sledding, Keep Out.” Three
weeks later, an eight-year-old boy was sledding down the hill on the
gravel pit owner's property when his sled coasted onto the adjacent
public road. The boy sustained serious injuries when he was struck by
a car.

If the boy asserts a negligence claim against the gravel pit owner, the
court should find for

(A) the boy, because danger invites rescue.

(B) the boy, if the gravel pit owner's failure to erect a fence to prevent

the accident was unreasonable.

912

(C) the gravel pit owner, because the car driver had the last clear

chance to avoid injuring the boy.

(D) the gravel pit owner, if the car driver's conduct was an intervening

cause of harm.

36. The seller knew that his car's engine was cracked. Because he wanted
to sell the car, he filled the crack with putty and painted it so that the
crack would not show. Then he brought the car to the buyer, a used car
dealer, and offered to sell it for $1,000 cash. The buyer placed the car
on a lift so that he could inspect it from underneath. He noticed the
filled crack but thought that he would be able to resell the car in spite
of it. The buyer offered $500, which the seller accepted. The next day,
the buyer was showing the car to a customer when the crack caused the
engine to explode, necessitating $500 in repairs and injuring the
customer.

If the buyer institutes an action against the seller for misrepresentation,
which of the following would be the seller's most effective argument
in defense?

(A) The seller made no representation concerning the engine.

(B) The buyer did not rely on the seller's representations concerning the

engine.

(C) The buyer was not justified in relying on the seller's representations

concerning the engine.

(D) The buyer did not sustain damage.

37. A driver stepped on his brake pedal. Because the brakes were not
working properly, he could not stop, and he continued into an
intersection. A second driver saw the first driver go through the red
light. Because the light was green in his favor, however, the second
driver did not stop; he continued into the intersection, believing that he
could avoid striking the first driver by steering around him. The two
vehicles collided in the intersection. The jurisdiction has a statute that
prohibits entering an intersection against a red traffic signal light and
another statute that adopts the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence.

In an action by the second driver against the first driver, the court
should find for

913

(A) the first driver, since the second driver had the last clear chance to

avoid the accident.

(B) the first driver, because it was unreasonable for the second driver

to enter the intersection when he did.

(C) the second driver, because the first driver's violation of statute was

a substantial factor in producing the damage.

(D) the second driver, since the first driver's conduct was negligence

per se.

38. A store owner wrote on a refrigerator “AS IS — $25.” A customer
bought the refrigerator. As she was loading it onto the customer's
pickup truck, the store owner said, “I hope you know that this
refrigerator doesn't work.” The customer said that he did. When the
customer got the refrigerator home, he plugged it in and received a
severe electrical shock while attempting to open its door.

In an action by the customer against the store owner for damages
resulting from his injury, the court will probably find for

(A) the customer, because it was unreasonable for the store owner to
sell the refrigerator without warning him about the wiring defect.

(B) the customer, since the refrigerator was unfit for ordinary use.

(C) the store owner, since the customer purchased the refrigerator “AS

IS.”

(D) the store owner, because the customer had the “last clear chance”

to avoid being injured.

39. The plaintiff was hunting on the defendant's land. The defendant told
the plaintiff to leave, but the plaintiff refused to do so. The defendant
then placed his hand on the plaintiff's chest and pushed him gently
backward, repeating his demand that the plaintiff leave. The plaintiff
shoved the defendant away from him and pointed his shotgun at the
defendant. The defendant immediately drew a pistol and fired at the
plaintiff, striking him in the arm and causing him to drop his shotgun.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for battery, the
court should find for

(A) the defendant, because he fired at the plaintiff to defend his realty

against a trespass.

914

(B) the defendant, because he fired at the plaintiff to defend himself

against the plaintiff's threat with the shotgun.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant struck the first blow.

(D) the plaintiff, because the defendant did not use force against him

until his entry onto the realty was complete.

40. A man kept a wildcat he had tamed as a pet. His neighbor was walking
past the man's house when the wildcat tore through a window screen,
jumped into the street, and attacked the neighbor, seriously injuring
him. The neighbor subsequently asserted a claim against the man for
his damages.

If the neighbor is successful in his claim against the man, it will
probably be because

(A) the neighbor's damages resulted from the man's keeping a wild

animal.

(B) it was foreseeable that the wildcat would do something

unforeseeable.

(C) the thing speaks for itself (res ipsa loquitur).

(D) the man's keeping the wildcat amounted to a private nuisance.

41. A company manufactured a safety helmet in hopes of selling it to the
military for general utility purposes, but it was unsuccessful in doing
so. Instead, it sold the helmets to the general public. The helmets were
packaged in boxes that showed pictures of three persons wearing the
helmet: one riding a horse, one riding a motorcycle, and one doing
construction work. A motorcyclist found a helmet that someone had
discarded in its original box. He wore it the next day while riding his
motorcycle and sustained a severe head injury when he fell.

The motorcyclist asserted a claim against the company for his injuries
in a jurisdiction that has adopted a rule of “pure comparative
negligence.” At the trial, the motorcyclist proved that the helmet was
not suitable for use as a motorcycle helmet, and that if it had been, he
would not have sustained injury.

The court should find for

(A) the company, because the motorcyclist found the helmet.

915

(B) the company, if the helmets were not designed or intended for use

as motorcycle helmets.

(C) the motorcyclist, unless his fall from the motorcycle resulted from

his own unreasonable conduct.

(D) the motorcyclist, because the box in which the helmet was sold

contained a picture of a person wearing the helmet while riding a
motorcycle.

42. When the owner brought his car to the mechanic's shop for repairs, the
mechanic told him that he would test-drive the car after repairing it.
While the mechanic was test-driving the car, he struck a pedestrian. A
statute in the jurisdiction provides that “The owner of any motor
vehicle operated on the roads of this state shall be vicariously liable
for the negligence of any person operating said motor vehicle with said
owner's permission.” The pedestrian instituted an action against the
owner and the mechanic and obtained a judgment against both of them
for $10,000.

If the owner pays the judgment in full, which of the following is
correct regarding the owner's rights against the mechanic?

(A) The owner may recover $10,000 from the mechanic.

(B) The owner may recover $5,000 from the mechanic.

(C) The owner may recover $7,500 from the mechanic.

(D) The owner may not recover from the mechanic.

43. A breeder of exotic birds preferred to mix feed for his birds according
to his own formula instead of using commercially available mixes. For
this purpose, he purchased a sealed 50-pound package of seeds from
the dealer, who was in the business of selling supplies for bird and
livestock breeders. The dealer had bought the sealed package from the
wholesaler, a wholesaler of seed and grain. Because of negligence at
the wholesaler's plant, the seeds in the package were poisonous. The
breeder fed the seeds to several of his birds, which died as a result.

If the breeder brings an action in strict liability against the wholesaler
for the value of the birds that died, a court is most likely to find for

(A) the breeder, because the poisonous nature of the seeds was a

defect.

916

(B) the breeder, because it was reasonable for the dealer to resell the

seeds without inspection.

(C) the wholesaler, since the wholesaler had no contractual

relationship with the breeder.

(D) the wholesaler, because the breeder will be unable to recover

damages from the dealer.

44. Although he had been warned that swimming within one hour after

eating was likely to cause a cramp, a swimmer went swimming in the
lake immediately after lunch. He had been swimming for a few minutes
when he developed severe cramps. Finding himself unable to swim any
further, he began calling for help. The swimmer's cries attracted the
attention of a rescuer, who happened to be walking near the lake. The
rescuer jumped into the water, swam to the swimmer's side, and,
grabbing the swimmer by the hair, towed him to safety. In getting out of
the lake, however, the rescuer cut his leg on a fragment of glass that
was embedded in the lake bottom.

If the rescuer asserts an action against the swimmer for personal
injuries, the court should find for

(A) the rescuer, because it was negligent for the swimmer to swim so

soon after eating.

(B) the rescuer, because his injury occurred while he was attempting to

rescue the swimmer.

(C) the swimmer, because danger invites rescue.

(D) the swimmer, because the glass fragment is an intervening cause of

the rescuer's injury.

45. The company was a manufacturer of computer hardware. The

defendant was a retailer who purchased products from the company. At
an industrial convention, the defendant told the company that he heard
that their mutual friend, the plaintiff, was about to go into personal
bankruptcy. The company did not believe what the defendant was
telling him and resolved to mention it to the plaintiff as soon as the
opportunity presented itself. The following day, the plaintiff called the
company to discuss computer hardware. The company told the plaintiff
what the defendant had said at the party. The plaintiff laughed, assured
the company that he was in excellent financial condition, and they both
laughed at the rumor.

917

If the plaintiff asserts a defamation claim against the defendant, which
of the following would be the defendant's most effective argument in
defense?

(A) The plaintiff did not experience mental suffering.

(B) The plaintiff did not sustain damage to his reputation as a result of

the statement.

(C) The defendant was only repeating what he had heard.

(D) The defendant did not publish any statement about the plaintiff.

46. The plaintiff was employed as an insulation installer by various

builders and general contractors for a period of 35 years. During that
time, he was repeatedly exposed to an insulating material manufactured
by the defendant. Last year, it was discovered for the first time that
exposure to the material is a cause of cancer and that the plaintiff had
contracted cancer as a result of his contact with the product.

In a jurisdiction that applies the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence, if the plaintiff asserts a negligence claim against the
defendant for damages resulting from the plaintiff's exposure to the
material, the defendant's most effective defense would be based on the
argument that

(A) the plaintiff assumed the risk.

(B) the defendant did not know that contact with the material would

result in cancer.

(C) the reasonable person in the defendant's situation would not have
anticipated that exposure to the material would result in cancer.

(D) the plaintiff's only remedy is that created by workers' compensation

statutes.

47. A gardener's flower and plant shop was located across the street from
a factory, in a building that the gardener rented from a landlord. Gases
from the factory caused some of the potted plants that the gardener had
for sale in his shop to die. One of the gardener's employees suffered
from allergies. As a result, he found the gases so irritating to his eyes
that he was unable to continue working at the gardener's shop and had
to quit his job. Who may successfully assert a private nuisance claim
against the factory?

918

(A) The landlord only.

(B) The landlord and the gardener only.

(C) The gardener and the employee only.

(D) The landlord, the gardener, and the employee.

48. When the defendant entered a restaurant for lunch, she hung her coat on
the coatrack. When she was leaving, she removed from the rack a coat
that looked like hers, but which actually belonged to the plaintiff. At
the time she took it, the defendant believed it to be her coat, but when
she had driven two miles from the restaurant, she realized that it was
not hers. She turned around and was driving back to the restaurant
when she was involved in an automobile accident. The accident
occurred because the defendant was not paying close attention to her
driving. The plaintiff's coat was completely destroyed in the accident.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for trespass to
chattel, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the coat was completely destroyed after the

defendant took it.

(B) the plaintiff, because the automobile accident in which the coat was

destroyed was the defendant's fault.

(C) the defendant, because she believed the coat to be her own when

she took it.

(D) the defendant, because she was making a reasonable effort to return

the coat when it was destroyed.

49. A trucker was eating cherry pie in a restaurant when a cherry pit

contained in the pie stuck in his throat. Unable to breathe, the trucker
began choking. A doctor, who was eating in the restaurant, ran to the
trucker's aid and performed an operation known as an emergency
tracheotomy. She did this by cutting the skin of the trucker's throat with
a pocket knife and creating an opening in his windpipe through which
the trucker was able to breathe. Then, at the doctor's direction, the
trucker walked across the street to a hospital so that the opening that
the doctor created could be cleaned and bandaged. Because hospital
employees negligently failed to enter the trucker's name in the
emergency room register, he sat in the emergency room for six hours
without further attention. At that time, an earthquake caused a portion

919

of the hospital's structure to fall, striking the trucker in the head and
fracturing his skull. The state had a “Good Samaritan” statute. An
earthquake had never occurred in the state before.

In an action by the trucker against the hospital for damages resulting
from his fractured skull, the court is most likely to find for

(A) the hospital, due to the “Good Samaritan” statute.

(B) the hospital, because the doctor's conduct was unforeseeable.

(C) the hospital, because it was unforeseeable that the trucker would be

injured by an earthquake if left waiting for six hours.

(D) the trucker, since a hospital owes its patients a duty to protect them

against natural disasters.

50. A homeowner went to a garden supply store to purchase fertilizer for
the apple trees that grew in his backyard. Since he did not know what
brand was best for his purposes, he asked the store's owner to
recommend a fertilizer that was especially good for apple trees. The
store owner suggested a product that he said was good for all fruit
trees. The homeowner purchased the product and applied it as the label
directed. While doing so, he got some of the product on his hands.
Because of an allergy that he had, the product irritated his skin, causing
him considerable pain and disabling him for a period of time.

In an action by the homeowner against the store owner for damages
resulting from breach of warranty, which of the following comments is
most correct?

(A) There was no implied warranty that the product was fit for the

homeowner's particular purpose because his purpose was the same
as the product's ordinary use.

(B) There was no implied warranty of merchantability since the
homeowner relied on the store owner's recommendation in
purchasing the product.

(C) There was neither an implied warranty that the product was fit for a
particular purpose nor an implied warranty of merchantability.

(D) There was an implied warranty that the product was fit for the

homeowner's particular use and there was an implied warranty of
merchantability.

920

51. The defendant is a supplier of telephone service to the city. Many of
the wooden poles from which the defendant's wires are strung have
been standing for more than 40 years and are in a rotted condition. A
driver lost control of his automobile because he was driving while
intoxicated, and he collided with one of the defendant's rotten poles.
As a result of the collision, the pole fell over, striking a parked car and
injuring the plaintiff, who was sitting in it. The force of the collision
would have caused even a reasonably good pole to fall.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the court should find
for

(A) the plaintiff, because it was unreasonable for the defendant to

permit its poles to become rotten.

(B) the plaintiff, since it was foreseeable that if a pole fell, it would

injure a person sitting in a parked car.

(C) the defendant, since the driver's conduct either amounted to gross

negligence or was criminal.

(D) the defendant, because the force of the collision would have caused

even a reasonably good pole to fall.

52. A truck and a car collided in an intersection. The drivers asserted

negligence claims against each other for damage to their vehicles. In
answer to specific questions posed by the court, the jury found that the
accident was 60 percent the fault of the truck driver and 40 percent the
fault of the car driver. In addition, the jury found that damage to the
truck amounted to $1,000 and that damage to the car amounted to
$10,000.

The jurisdiction had a statute that provided that “In any negligence
action, a plaintiff's recovery shall not be barred by that plaintiff's fault,
but the recovery of said plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to
that plaintiff's fault.” Which of the following correctly states the sum to
which the car driver is entitled?

(A) $6,000 ($10,000 less 40 percent).

(B) $4,000 ($10,000 less 60 percent).

(C) $10,000.

(D) 0.

921

53. A boy, who was 11 years old, received a sled manufactured by the sled
company from his uncle as a Christmas present. Since he already had a
better sled, the boy sold the sled to his neighbor, the plaintiff. The
plaintiff was riding the sled down a snow-covered hill when one of the
bolts that held it together broke, causing the sled to overturn and injure
the plaintiff severely. The bolt broke because of a crack that existed
when the sled left the sled factory but which was too minute to be
discovered by reasonable inspection. If the plaintiff brings an action
against the sled company, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the cracked bolt was a defect.

(B) the plaintiff, because the boy did not use the sled before selling it to

the plaintiff.

(C) the sled company, since the sale by the boy was outside the regular

course of business.

(D) the sled company, because the crack was too minute to be

discovered upon reasonable inspection.

54. The landlord was the owner of a four-story office building. The entire
second floor of the building was leased to an attorney, and the other
floors were divided into offices and leased to various other tenants.
The attorney was riding in the building elevator when it suddenly and
without warning plunged swiftly downward, shaking the attorney up
severely. The lease required the landlord to keep the elevator in good
repair. Minutes later, the attorney led one of his clients to the elevator.
When they were riding in the elevator to the attorney's office the
elevator suddenly plunged swiftly downward, stopping short when it
reached the bottom of the elevator shaft. The client was severely
injured in the fall.

The client asserted a negligence claim against the attorney for damages
resulting from the elevator accident. The court should find for

(A) the client, because the attorney knew or should have known that the

elevator might not be working properly.

(B) the client, because the entire second floor had been leased to the

attorney.

(C) the attorney, because the lease required the landlord to keep the

elevator in good repair.

922

(D) the attorney, because he was only a tenant in the building.

55. A trucker was driving a truckload of gravel over a highway in a rural
part of the state when, through no fault of her own, one of the tires on
her truck blew out, causing the truck to go out of control. The truck
overturned, spilling the gravel onto the land of the landowner, which
was adjacent to the road. The trucker, who was unhurt, returned later
with another truck and a tractor equipped with a power shovel. Using
the power shovel, the trucker scooped up the spilled gravel and loaded
it onto the other truck.

If the landowner asserts a claim against the trucker for trespass to
land, the court should award the landowner a judgment for

(A) nominal damages only.

(B) all damages resulting from the spilling of gravel onto the

landowner's land.

(C) only the damages caused by the trucker's removal of the gravel from

the landowner's land.

(D) no damages.

56. A horseman owned and bred horses and was an excellent rider. He
purchased a horse he had heard was wild and dangerous because he
hoped that he would be able to “break” or train him. Each time the
horseman attempted to approach the horse, however, it reared and
kicked at him. Finally, the horseman hired a professional horse trainer
to break the horse. After explaining that the horse had repeatedly
attacked him, the horseman showed the trainer to the corral. While the
horseman stood outside watching, the trainer entered the corral,
holding out his hand and making soft murmuring noises to attract the
horse's attention. When the horse saw the trainer, the horse kicked him,
fracturing the trainer's leg.

If the trainer asserts a claim for damages against the horseman, the
court should find for

(A) the trainer, since the horseman knew that the horse had a propensity

to attack human beings.

(B) the trainer, since the horse was a wild animal.

(C) the trainer, since the horseman acted unreasonably in permitting the

923

trainer to enter the corral under the circumstances.

(D) the horseman, since the trainer knew that the horse was dangerous

when he entered the corral.

57. A man bought a used car from the car dealer. Although the car dealer
assured the man that he believed the car to be in good condition, the
contract of sale signed by both the man and the car dealer contained the
phrase “This Vehicle Sold AS IS” in large black letters. The man was
driving the car the following day when the steering jammed, causing
the car to collide with a power pole. The man's wife, who was sitting
beside him in the car, was injured in the crash.

If the wife asserts a claim for damages against the car dealer on the
grounds that the car dealer breached the implied warranty of
merchantability, the court should find for

(A) the car dealer, because the contract of sale contained the phrase,

“This Vehicle Sold AS IS.”

(B) the car dealer, because he did not enter into any contractual

relationship with the wife.

(C) the wife, because the vehicle was unfit for ordinary use.

(D) the wife, because the car dealer said that he believed the car to be

in good condition.

58. The plaintiff brought her car to the defendant, a used car dealer, asking
him to sell it for her. The defendant said that he would attempt to do so
on consignment, at a commission consisting of 20 percent of the sale
price. The plaintiff said that the terms were acceptable to her, but that
because she had recently spent $800 for a custom two-tone, black-and-
silver paint job, she wanted the car kept out of the sun. The defendant
agreed, and the plaintiff left the car with him.

The defendant left the car in the sun, which caused its paint to fade.
Believing that a new paint job would make the car easier to sell, the
defendant had it painted red without consulting the plaintiff. Before it
was repainted, the defendant drove the plaintiff's car 4,000 miles on
his own personal business. After it was painted, the defendant's
customers drove it an additional 1,000 miles while deciding whether
to purchase it. Although the value of the plaintiff's car did not change
while it was in the defendant's possession, the defendant was unable to

924

sell the car. The plaintiff subsequently asserted a conversion claim
against the defendant.

If the plaintiff is successful in her conversion action, the most she will
be entitled to recover is

(A) the value that the car had at the time the plaintiff delivered it to the

defendant.

(B) the cost of restoring its paint to the condition that existed at the time

she delivered it to the defendant.

(C) the reasonable value of the car's use for 4,000 miles.

(D) nothing.

59. A company made a strong insecticide. The container bore a label that
read: “For killing termites. Caution: This product is intended for use
by professional exterminators only. Unauthorized use by any other
persons may be dangerous.” The shop owner placed the container on a
shelf in his shop, where it was discovered by an independent
contractor who the shop owner periodically hired to clean his shop.
Since the cleaner thought there were termites in his house, he opened
the container and poured some of it into a plastic bag that he then
brought home. The next day, the cleaner's three-year-old daughter found
the plastic bag and ate some of the insecticide, becoming seriously ill
as a result. A statute in the jurisdiction adopted the all-or-nothing rule
of contributory negligence.

In a negligence action by the girl against the company, the company's
most effective argument in defense would be that

(A) the cleaner was contributorily negligent.

(B) the shop owner's conduct was an intervening cause of harm.

(C) the cleaner's conduct was an intervening cause of harm.

(D) the company did not act unreasonably.

60. A warehouse owner was the owner of a warehouse that was usually
unattended at night. As a result, burglars had broken in on several
occasions and had stolen valuable merchandise from the warehouse.
The warehouse owner looked into the possibility of hiring a security
guard but decided that it would be too expensive. Instead, he installed
an explosive device in the doorway, rigging it to explode if anyone

925

opened the door without first inserting a key in a specially constructed
slot. A burglar was attempting to break into the warehouse owner's
warehouse for the purpose of stealing when the explosive device
detonated while he was trying to open the door. The burglar was
seriously injured in the explosion.

If the burglar is successful in an action against the warehouse owner, it
will 
most probably be because the court finds that

(A) it was negligent for the warehouse owner to install the explosive

device, since it was foreseeable that a person entering on
legitimate business might be injured by it.

(B) the warehouse owner used excessive force to defend his property,
since the explosive device was liable to inflict serious or deadly
injury.

(C) the use of a mechanical device is not permitted in defense of

property.

(D) the explosive device was just as likely to injure an innocent

bystander as a thief.

61. After living together for several months, a man and his girlfriend began
to argue frequently. The following Saturday, the girlfriend took all the
man's possessions, including his television set, which was valued at
$600, to a swap meet in hopes of selling them. At the swap meet, she
put up a sign that said, “Moving. Everything Must Be Sold Today.”

A neighbor was browsing at the swap meet when she saw the
television set at the girlfriend's booth. She asked whether it was in
good condition, and when the girlfriend said that it was, she asked the
price. The girlfriend said, “$50.” The neighbor immediately handed
the girlfriend the cash, placed the television in her station wagon, and
hurried home.

In an action by the man against the neighbor for conversion, a court
should find for

(A) the man, since the neighbor desired to make the television her own,

and did so.

(B) the man, since the price of $50 should have made the neighbor

926

aware that there was something suspicious about the sale.

(C) the neighbor, since it was reasonable for her to believe that the
girlfriend owned the television set and that the price was low
because the girlfriend needed to sell it in a hurry.

(D) the neighbor, since the television was not in the man's possession

when she acquired it.

62. The plaintiff and the defendant lived on the same street and worked in
the same office, so they formed a car pool, each driving his own car on
alternate days. One day while the defendant was driving, the car in
front of his stopped suddenly and without warning. Since the defendant
had taken his eyes off the road for a moment to look at the plaintiff, he
was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of the stopped
car. The plaintiff was injured as a result of the collision.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “No person shall maintain an
action for damages resulting from negligence in the operation or
ownership of an automobile if said person was a guest in said
automobile at the time said damages allegedly occurred.” In an action
by the plaintiff against the defendant for damages resulting from his
injuries, which of the following arguments is most likely to result in a
judgment for the plaintiff?

(A) The fact that most drivers have insurance makes the statute

obsolete.

(B) The plaintiff was not a guest, since his driving on alternate days

was consideration for the ride.

(C) The defendant's conduct was reckless and therefore constituted
aggravated negligence, a lawsuit that is not prohibited by the
statute.

(D) Enforcement of the statute will leave the plaintiff without a remedy.

63. The company is the manufacturer of a device that was designed for use
by professional rescuers in removing accident victims who have
become pinned in automobiles.

A fire department purchased the device from a firefighter supply store.
Subsequently, the fire department was called to the scene of an
accident in which a woman was trapped in her car. The fire chief
directed a volunteer firefighter to use the device to free the woman

927

from her car, although he knew that the volunteer firefighter had not
been trained in its use and had never heard of it before.

Due to a crack caused by a manufacturing defect, the device operated
improperly, injuring the volunteer firefighter. If the volunteer
firefighter institutes an action against the company, the company's most
effective argument in defense would be that

(A) it had acted reasonably in its marketing and sale of the device.

(B) the firefighter supply store substantially changed the device before

selling it to the fire department.

(C) the volunteer firefighter assumed the risk, since he attempted to use

the device without proper training.

(D) the volunteer firefighter's attempt to use the machine without

training was an independent intervening cause of harm that broke
the chain of proximate causation.

64. As a result of her neighbor's negligence, a baker's shoulder and eye

were both injured. The baker went immediately to her eye doctor. The
eye doctor treated the injury to the baker's eye but suggested that she
see an orthopedist for treatment of her shoulder. The following day, the
baker visited an orthopedist, who treated the baker's shoulder.

Because of negligent treatment by the eye doctor, the baker's nose
became infected, and because of negligent treatment by the
orthopedist, she lost the use of her elbow.

In an action by the baker against the eye doctor, a court is most likely
to hold the eye doctor liable for

(A) nothing, since all the injuries were caused by the negligence of the

neighbor.

(B) the injury to the baker's nose, since it is the only one of her injuries

that was caused by his negligence.

(C) the injury to the baker's nose and the injury to the baker's elbow,

since both were caused by his negligence.

(D) the injuries to the baker's nose, shoulder, and elbow, since all were

caused by his negligence.

65. After taking and failing the state bar exam on 12 different occasions, an

928

attorney decided to practice law without a license. Moving to a small
town, he hung out a shingle that proclaimed him to be an attorney and
ran advertisements in the local newspaper referring to himself as an
attorney. Having seen one of the advertisements, a client retained the
attorney to defend him against a charge of driving while intoxicated.
The attorney attempted to negotiate a plea to a lesser charge, but
because he was unable to do so, a trial was held. The attorney
appeared on behalf of the client, but the client was convicted. During
the course of the trial, the district attorney became suspicious of the
attorney's credentials because he did not defend his client in the way a
reasonable attorney would have done. Following an investigation that
the district attorney instituted, the attorney was charged with violation
of a state law that made it a crime to practice law without a license. He
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months in jail.

If the client brings an action against the 
attorney for negligence in the way the attorney handled his defense, a
court should find for

(A) the client, because the attorney failed to defend him the way a

reasonable attorney would have done.

(B) the client, since it was unreasonable for the attorney to practice law

without a license.

(C) the client, since the law that prohibited practicing law without a

license was designed to keep unqualified persons from practicing
law.

(D) the attorney, since not even a licensed attorney guarantees results.

66. The plaintiff was attending a nightclub at which a hypnotist was
performing. Before the show began, a request was made for a
volunteer to assist the hypnotist with his act, and the plaintiff
volunteered. She was taken backstage to the hypnotist's dressing room,
where she and the hypnotist had a conversation. Following their
conversation, the plaintiff agreed to participate in the hypnotist's show.
During the course of the performance, the hypnotist attempted to
hypnotize the plaintiff on stage. He then touched her skin with an
electric cattle prod (a device that produces an electric shock and is
used for handling stubborn cattle), causing her great pain and
discomfort.

929

The plaintiff subsequently instituted an action against the hypnotist. In
it, she alleged that he committed various intentional torts against her
by touching her with the cattle prod. If one of the following facts were
established at the trial, which one would be most helpful to the
plaintiff in responding to the hypnotist's defense of consent?

(A) During the conversation in the hypnotist's dressing room, the
hypnotist stated that he was going to attempt to hypnotize the
plaintiff on stage, he was usually successful in hypnotizing
volunteers, and if he was successful, the cattle prod would cause
her no discomfort.

(B) During the conversation in the hypnotist's dressing room, the

hypnotist promised to pay her $100 for participating in the show;
he never did pay her; and, in fact, when he promised that he would
pay her, he did not intend to do so.

(C) During the conversation in the hypnotist's dressing room, the
hypnotist stated that the electric cattle prod produced a mild
electric shock that would cause no real discomfort, when he knew
that this was not true.

(D) When the plaintiff consented to participating in the hypnotist's act,

she did not know that contact with the electric cattle prod would
result in great pain and discomfort.

67. A professor publicly stated her opposition to the consumption of

alcohol. As a result, she is much in demand as a lecturer on the evils of
intoxication. One of her slogans is, “When you drink, make it fruit
juice.” The company, a producer of packaged apple juice, invited the
professor to participate in a promotional apple-juice-drinking contest
that it was holding. The professor, who succeeded in drinking one and
one-half quarts of chilled apple juice without stopping for a breath,
was declared the winner.

The student newspaper ran a photo of the professor holding the
winner's trophy over a caption that read, “Prof. drinks them all under
the table, winning first prize at the company's drinking contest.” A
story that described the fruit-juice drinking contest in detail appeared
on the same page as the photo but some distance from it. The day after
the photo and story appeared, an organization that had hired the
professor to lecture on the evils of alcohol canceled its contract with
the professor because, after seeing the photo and caption in the

930

newspaper, some members believed that the professor was a drinker
of alcohol.

If the professor sues the newspaper for defamation, the court should
instruct the jury that the statements made by the newspaper in the photo
and caption were not defamatory if

(A) the reasonable person would have read the story.

(B) the organization members who saw the photo and caption did not

read the story.

(C) a substantial group of respectable persons would have read the

story.

(D) the reasonable person would not have read the story.

68. An athlete appeared in a television commercial. While films of his

medal-winning performances showed in the background, the athlete ate
a candy bar. He said that he had been eating candy bars for energy ever
since he was a child. He ended the commercial by smiling and saying,
“Who knows? Maybe candy bars gave me the power to win.”

The plaintiff purchased a case of 24 candy bars after seeing the
commercial several times on television. After tasting one, however, he
found he did not like the flavor. If the plaintiff brings an action against
the athlete for misrepresentation, which of the following arguments
will be most helpful in the athlete's defense?

(A) The athlete is not in the business of selling candy bars.

(B) The script for the commercial was not written by the athlete.

(C) The plaintiff was not in privity with the athlete.

(D) The plaintiff has not sustained damage as the result of a false

assertion by the athlete.

69. A demolition contractor was hired by a builder to demolish a building
located a half-mile from a horse breeder's farm. The demolition
contractor was using dynamite for that purpose. The breeder called the
contractor and warned him that sounds from the explosions were
scaring his horses. The day after the breeder called, sounds of the
explosions so frightened one of the breeder's horses that the horse tried
to jump over a fence, injuring herself in the process.

931

If the breeder institutes an action against the demolition contractor on a
strict liability theory, which of the following would be the demolition
contractor's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The breeder's farm was not within the foreseeable zone of danger.

(B) The possibility that noise will frighten animals is not one of the

risks that makes blasting an ultra-hazardous activity.

(C) The demolition contractor used reasonable care in setting off the

blast.

(D) The demolition contractor was working under contract to the

builder.

70. The landlord was the owner of a small office building. Her own office
was located on the ground floor of the building, the second floor was
leased to a company, and the third and fourth floors were divided into
smaller offices that were rented to various tenants on a month-to-month
basis. Although the building was equipped with an elevator, occupants
of the building frequently used a stairway over which the landlord
retained control. One day, while one of the company's employees was
walking down the stairs from the second floor, she cut her hand on a
jagged part of the handrail that ran alongside the stairs. She
commenced an action against the landlord, alleging that the handrail
was jagged because of negligence by the landlord.

Which of the following is an accurate statement about the case of the
injured employee vs. the landlord?

(A) The company's employee was an invitee since she was an

employee of one of the landlord's tenants.

(B) The company's employee was contributorily (or comparatively)
negligent if the reasonable person in her situation would have
noticed the jagged condition of the handrail and would have
avoided being injured by it.

(C) The company's employee was an invitee, and she was

contributorily (or comparatively) negligent if the reasonable person
in her situation would have noticed the jagged condition of the
handrail and would have avoided being injured by it.

(D) The company's employee was neither an invitee nor was she

contributorily (or comparatively) negligent.

932

71. A building inspector was employed by the city to conduct periodic
inspections of business premises located in a territory to which she
was assigned. The instruction manual that the city furnished to its
inspectors contained instructions on testing draperies for fire-retardant
properties. In large boldface letters, the manual stated, “NEVER
EXPOSE DRAPERIES TO FLAME WHILE THEY ARE HANGING
IN PLACE.”

One of the businesses in the building inspector's territory was a
nightclub. On one of her inspections of the nightclub, the building
inspector asked the manager of the business whether the window
draperies were fire-retardant as required by the city's building code.
The manager responded that they were. Although the building
inspector was familiar with the instructions in the manual, she was in a
hurry. Taking a cigarette lighter from her pocket, she held its flame
under one of the draperies where it was hanging. The drapery caught
fire, which spread, completely destroying the building. A passerby
was injured in the fire.

If the passerby brings an action for damages against the city on a
theory of respondeat superior, the passerby will

(A) lose, since the building inspector was acting in violation of

specific instructions from her employer.

(B) lose, since the building inspector's duties involve the exercise of

unsupervised discretion.

(C) win, because the building inspector was negligent.

(D) win, whether or not the building inspector was negligent.

72. A statute provides that every motor vehicle must be equipped with an
ignition lock, and that it shall be a misdemeanor for any person to park
a motor vehicle without locking it and removing the ignition key. The
statute was enacted after many accidents involving stolen cars. The
defendant left his car parked on a public street with the ignition key in
it, in violation of the statute. A small monkey that had escaped from a
nearby circus got in the car, managed to turn the key, and drove the car
down the street before hitting the plaintiff. If the plaintiff sues the
defendant, the plaintiff will:

(A) win, because it was unreasonable for the defendant to leave his

keys in the ignition.

933

(B) win, because the statute was designed to prevent accidents

involving stolen cars.

(C) lose, because the intervention of the monkey was likely

unforeseeable.

(D) lose, because the intervention of the monkey was likely

foreseeable.

73. The state governor was attending a major league baseball game when a
member of the home team hit a home run. The governor jumped to his
feet and cheered loudly, along with the rest of the crowd. A freelance
photographer took his picture while he was cheering. When the
photograph was developed, the photographer had it imprinted on
targets. With toy plastic darts, the photographer marketed and sold
several thousand. The governor sued the photographer for invasion of
privacy.

On which of the following theories is the governor most likely to be
successful in his action against the photographer?

(A) Appropriation of identity.

(B) Public disclosure.

(C) Intrusion.

(D) False light.

74. A professor was disturbed by the fact that students frequently left the
room during her lectures, so she instructed her teaching assistant to
lock the door of her classroom 10 minutes after the class began and not
to unlock it again until 10 minutes before the class was scheduled to
end. On Thursday, a student attended the professor's four o'clock class.
By five minutes past four, the student was sound asleep in his seat. At
ten minutes past four, the teaching assistant locked the classroom door
as instructed by the professor, unlocking it at ten minutes to five. When
the class ended at five, the student, who had slept through the class,
was awakened by a classmate and left the room. The classroom had
been painted the previous day with a paint to which the student was
allergic, although neither the professor, the teaching assistant, nor the
student knew about it. As a result of his exposure to the paint in the
room, the student developed allergic symptoms later that day that
required hospitalization.

934

If the student institutes an action for false imprisonment against the
professor, who will win?

(A) The student, because his illness resulted from the professor's

intentional confinement of him.

(B) The student, since a professor owes her students a duty to refrain
from exposing them to unreasonable risks of foreseeable harm.

(C) The professor, since she did not know with substantial certainty that

harm would result from locking the door.

(D) The professor, since she did not confine the student against his will.

75. The Lovers of God is a small religious sect. During the 19th century,
they were prosecuted for engaging in religious rituals that involved
public nudity and group sex. Some non-members of the sect continue to
associate it with illicit sex and continue to call its members “Makers,”
a term coined by 19th-century journalists who campaigned against the
sect.

A minister ordained in the Church of Love, a religious organization
that is not associated in any way with the Lovers, spoke at a local
meeting. The following day, a local daily newspaper printed an article
about the meeting. The article referred to the minister as “a minister of
the Church of Love, better known as the Makers (Lovers of God).”
The minister sued the newspaper, alleging that the reference to him as
a minister of “the Makers (Lovers of God)” was defamatory.

In his lawsuit, the minister must prove that the newspaper

(A) knew, or that the reasonable publisher would have known, that the

minister was not affiliated with the Lovers of God.

(B) entertained serious doubts about whether or not the minister was

affiliated with the Lovers of God.

(C) knew that “the Makers (Lovers of God)” were associated with

shame or disgrace in the minds of some readers.

(D) made the statement, but the minister is not required to prove fault

since the minister is not a public person.

76. The defendant owned a small hardware store. One of the products he
sold were circular saws made by a local manufacturer. The defendant
sold the saws in their original boxes. One day, the defendant sold the

935

plaintiff a saw. Two years later, the plaintiff hurt herself badly when
the blade detached from the saw and cut her in the face. The blade
broke free after delivery to the plaintiff and was due to poor design by
the manufacturing company. There was no research available that
would have indicated to the defendant that there was a risk of such
injury or that the product was badly designed. The plaintiff sued the
defendant for her injuries. Assuming the saw design constituted a
dangerous defect, the court should find

(A) in favor of the defendant, because there was no indication the

defendant behaved negligently.

(B) in favor of the defendant, because there was no way the defendant
could have discovered the risk of such breakage before selling the
product to the plaintiff.

(C) in favor of the plaintiff, because the defendant sold the saw.

(D) in favor of the plaintiff, because selling the defective saws was

unreasonable.

77. A driver was driving her automobile in the rain on a curvy road known

for numerous accidents when she rounded a bend and saw a cow
standing directly in her path. She immediately jammed on her brakes
and pulled the steering wheel to the right in an attempt to avoid striking
the cow. As a result, she lost control of her car, which skidded off the
road and into the homeowner's yard. The homeowner, who was in the
process of installing an automatic watering system, had dug a trench
across the yard for pipes. When the wheels of the driver's car hit the
trench, the car stopped abruptly, throwing the driver forward into the
windshield and causing her to be injured.

In an action by the driver against the homeowner for negligence, will a
court decide 
that the homeowner owed the driver a duty of reasonable care?

(A) Yes, because it was foreseeable that persons driving on the road

might lose control of their vehicles and skid into the homeowner's
yard.

(B) Yes, because the homeowner knew that drivers used the

neighboring road.

(C) No, because it was not unreasonable for the homeowner to dig a

trench on his own land.

936

(D) No, because the driver was a trespasser.

78. A carpenter who was building a house on his own property had posted
a sign that said, “No Trespassing.” While he was working, he threw his
hammer off the roof. The hammer hit a truck driver who was walking
across the property because he mistakenly thought he was supposed to
deliver a load of wood to the carpenter. Even though he saw the
hammer hit, the carpenter failed to call for help. A passerby called an
ambulance, and after the ambulance picked up the truck driver, the
ambulance had an accident resulting in the truck driver's death.

The representative of the truck driver's estate instituted an appropriate
action against the carpenter, alleging that the carpenter's failure to call
for medical assistance after he saw the hammer strike the truck driver
was negligence. Which of the following comments is most accurate
regarding that allegation?

(A) The carpenter owed the truck driver no duty to call for help if the

truck driver was a trespasser.

(B) The truck driver's estate is entitled to punitive (exemplary)

damages if the carpenter was substantially certain that there was a
possibility of harm resulting from his failure to act.

(C) The carpenter's failure to call for medical aid was not a factual

cause of harm to the truck driver since someone did call a moment
later.

(D) the truck driver was an invitee since he was a user of the public

street who had entered upon adjacent private land.

79. The company had been operating a soap factory in the county for 50
years. When the factory was first opened, the nearest residential
settlement was the town, six miles away. Because the factory has been
in existence for 50 years, county zoning ordinances were drafted to
allow its continued operation. In the past 50 years, however, the town
has expanded in size. Now the edge of town is only a quarter of a mile
from the company's factory. On days when the wind is blowing from
the direction of the factory, residents of the town are annoyed by the
noxious odor emanating from the factory chimneys. A homeowner, who
moved to the town three years ago, has asked the town attorney to seek
an injunction to prohibit the company from emitting foul odors, but the
town attorney has refused.

937

If the homeowner sues the company for damages resulting from the
odors on a theory of public nuisance, which of the following will be
the company's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The company's operation preceded the growth of the town.

(B) The homeowner came to the nuisance.

(C) The homeowner's damages are no different from those of other

residents of the town.

(D) A lawful activity cannot constitute a public nuisance.

80. The defendant and the plaintiff had been friends for years and worked
in the same office. Ever since they were children, they had enjoyed
playing practical jokes on each other. One day, planning to have some
fun with the plaintiff, the defendant bought a large rubber spider from a
toy store. Knowing that the plaintiff was terrified of spiders, the
defendant came into work early and placed the toy spider in the top
drawer of the plaintiff's desk. Later, when the plaintiff arrived at work,
he opened his top drawer and saw the rubber spider. Believing it to be
real and terrified that it would bite him, the plaintiff screamed in fear,
fainted, and fell to the floor. As he fell, he struck his head on the corner
of his desk, sustaining a serious fracture of the skull.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim for assault against the defendant for the
injury that he sustained in the fall, which of the following arguments
would be most effective in the defendant's defense?

(A) The plaintiff's fear of being bitten by a spider was not apprehension

of a battery.

(B) The reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would not have

become apprehensive at the sight of a spider.

(C) The plaintiff impliedly consented to the prank by engaging in a

course of practical joking with the defendant.

(D) The defendant was not substantially certain that the plaintiff would

be injured as a result of the joke.

81. The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, and proved

the following:

The defendant and his friend were both slingshot enthusiasts known for
the accuracy of their aim. Without consulting the other, each went

938

independently to the woods outside of town to practice his or her skill.
Since not many people frequented the area, the defendant and his
friend were both somewhat casual about their targets, each shooting at
anything that moved without properly checking to make sure of what
they were shooting at. The plaintiff, who had gone to the woods to
read in solitude, was struck by a steel ball shot from one of the
slingshots. Since the defendant and his friend were using the same kind
of ammunition, it is impossible to determine which of them fired the
ball that struck the plaintiff, but it is certain that one of them did.

If the court finds for the defendant, it will probably be for which one
of the following reasons?

(A) The defendant did not owe the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care

since not many people frequented the area.

(B) There is no evidence that the defendant acted unreasonably.

(C) The evidence does not establish that the defendant's conduct was a

factual cause of the injury.

(D) Even if the defendant's conduct was a factual cause of the injury, it
is impossible to tell whether it was a legal cause of the injury.

82. Statutes in the state provide that persons under the age of 20 years are
incompetent to enter into contracts, may not marry without the written
consent of their parents, may not lawfully purchase alcoholic
beverages, and are subject to local curfew regulations. A 19-year-old
girl was fishing for pleasure from a pier in the state when she
accidentally struck a fisherman in the eye with a fishhook on the end of
her line. The fisherman commenced a negligence action against the girl.
The trial court should find that the girl was negligent because

(A) she failed to act like a reasonable 19-year-old with her experience

and intelligence.

(B) fishing is an adult activity.

(C) at 19 she is old enough to be treated as an adult by the law of torts.

(D) the risk of injury caused by her use of the fishhook outweighs the

utility of fishing for pleasure.

83. A company manufactured several kinds of cooked-fruit desserts.

A man bought one of the company's desserts at a grocery store, opened

939

the package and began eating the contents with a spoon. After
consuming more than half of the product, the man noticed parts of a
rat's tail mixed with the cooked fruit.

If the man asserts a claim against the company on the theory of strict
liability in tort, which of the following would be the man's most
effective argument?

(A) The presence of a rat's tail was a defect that made the product

unreasonably dangerous.

(B) The man was in horizontal privity with the grocery store, and there

is no need for vertical privity.

(C) The labeling and packaging implied a promise that the contents of

the package purchased by the man were fit for human consumption.

(D) The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, since the product was

sold in a sealed package.

84. A driver swerved to avoid a car and hit a boy walking along the road.
The boy's mother had told the boy that she did not want him riding his
bicycle on the road because it was a heavily travelled roadway with
no sidewalks. She gave him permission, however, to walk his bicycle
carefully along the road shoulder.

The jurisdiction applies the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence.

If the boy's mother asserts a negligence claim against the driver for the
medical bills that she incurred as a result of the boy's injury, which of
the following may the driver assert in defense?

(A) The accident resulted from the boy's negligence.

(B) The accident resulted from the boy's mother's negligence.

(C) The accident resulted from both the boy's and his mother's

negligence.

(D) The driver cannot claim that either the boy or his mother was

negligent.

85. The defendant was towing a small travel-trailer with his automobile
when the hitch that attached the trailer to the car broke, causing the
trailer to collide with the vehicle of the plaintiff, which was parked at

940

the curb. A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “No person shall
operate a motor vehicle or trailer on the roads of this state unless said
motor vehicle or trailer is covered by a valid policy of liability
insurance.” The defendant was in violation of that statute in that he
knew that his trailer was not covered by a valid policy of liability
insurance at the time of the accident. Is his violation of statute relevant
to the issue of negligence in an action brought against him by the
plaintiff?

(A) Yes, because the statute was designed to protect the victims of

automobile and trailer accidents.

(B) Yes, because the reasonable person does not knowingly violate a

statute.

(C) No, because the law encourages the purchase of automobile

insurance and therefore absolutely prohibits disclosure to the jury
about whether or not a defendant was insured.

(D) No, because compliance with the statute does not prevent

automobile or trailer accidents.

86. One night, police officers received a message that a burglary was in

progress at a grocery store. In the ensuing attempt to make an arrest, the
officers knocked over several stacks of merchandise, including cases
of bottled soda-pop manufactured by the company. This caused minute
cracks in all the bottles. A woman purchased one of the bottles but did
not notice the minute crack in it.

That evening, the woman was placing the bottle on the dinner table
when the bottle exploded. The woman was cut by flying glass.

In an action by the woman against the company, may she successfully
rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur?

(A) Yes, because it applies in exploding bottle cases.

(B) Yes, because the company was in exclusive control of the bottling

process.

(C) No, because the bottles were knocked over by the officers.

(D) No, because the bottles were not in the company's possession at the

time the woman's injury occurred.

87. A contractor did some renovations on a customer's apartment. In order

941

to put in a new window, the contractor used a glue made by a local
manufacturer. Due to a design defect, the glue released highly toxic
fumes that floated into a neighbor's apartment and caused severe lung
injuries. The neighbor can recover

(A) in strict liability against the contractor.

(B) in strict liability against the manufacturer.

(C) in strict liability against the contractor or manufacturer.

(D) in negligence only.

88. One day, while a well-known collector was visiting the dealer's art
gallery, the dealer showed him a new painting that she had received
that day.

“The artist didn't sign it,” the dealer said. “But I'm sure it was painted
by Degas. That would make it worth at least $250,000.”

The collector answered, “It's by Degas, all right. It's worth every cent
you're asking. But I already have several paintings by Degas in my
collection, and I don't need another.”

The buyer, who was browsing in the dealer's gallery, overheard the
conversation between the collector and the dealer. The buyer knew
very little about art. Because he knew that the collector and the dealer
were art experts, he believed what he heard them saying. After the
collector left the gallery, the buyer purchased the painting for
$225,000. The buyer subsequently learned that it had not been painted
by Degas and was worth only $600.

If the buyer asserts a tort claim for misrepresentation against the
dealer, which of the following would be the dealer's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) A statement of opinion cannot be construed as a misrepresentation,

since there is no such thing as a false idea.

(B) The buyer did not sustain damage as a result of his reliance on a

statement by the dealer.

(C) The dealer did not know that the buyer would rely on the statements

that she made to the collector.

(D) The value of any work of art is a matter of opinion.

942

89. As a joke, the defendant knocked on the plaintiff's door wearing a

police officer's uniform that he had rented from a costume shop. When
the plaintiff came to the door, the defendant told her that her husband
had just been killed in a highway accident, and that she would have to
come with him to claim the body. The plaintiff, who recognized the
defendant and knew that he was not a police officer, slammed the door
in his face and told him to leave her alone. She was outraged at his
attempt to play such a joke on her, but she sustained no physical or
mental injury.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for intentional
infliction of emotional distress, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant's conduct exceeded all bounds

normally tolerated by decent society.

(B) the plaintiff, because the defendant's conduct was calculated to

cause severe mental suffering.

(C) the defendant, because his intention was merely to play a joke on

the plaintiff.

(D) the defendant, because the plaintiff sustained no physical or mental

injury as a result of the defendant's conduct.

90. Which of the following most correctly states the duty owed to
customers by a druggist who dispenses prescription drugs?

(A) To know all the harmful side effects of the drugs being dispensed.

(B) To warn of all the harmful side effects of the drugs being dispensed.

(C) To sell only those drugs that are not defective.

(D) To make whatever inspection of the drugs is reasonable before

dispensing them.

91. A plaintiff asserted a claim for damages against a man and his friend.

The man and his friend had been trying to see who could hit a golf ball
farthest. The plaintiff succeeded in proving that a golf ball that struck
him had been driven by one of them, but he was unable to show which
one. The court found that both the man and his friend had acted
negligently, and that they were involved in a concert of action.

Which of the following statements is most correct about the
relationship of the parties?

943

(A) Either the man or his friend may avoid liability by proving that his

ball was not the one that struck the plaintiff.

(B) Neither the man's nor his friend's conduct was a factual cause of
harm because each one's conduct was a substantial factor in
producing the plaintiff's injury.

(C) The man's conduct and his friend's conduct were legal causes of

harm, but neither was a factual cause of harm.

(D) The man and his friend may each be held vicariously liable for the

other's conduct.

92. A cancer patient was given a drug that caused her to have an allergic

reaction that blinded her in one eye. The patient subsequently retained
an attorney to commence a malpractice action against the doctor for the
damages that resulted from her allergic reaction. Although the statute of
limitations on such an action fixed a period of one year, more than one
year passed before the attorney commenced an action against the
doctor. As a result, no such action could ever be brought. The patient
eventually sued the attorney, alleging that the attorney's failure to bring
the action on time was negligent.

Which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most effective as part of the attorney's
defense?

(A) The attorney had been admitted to the bar only three weeks before

being retained by the patient.

(B) The attorney honestly believed that the statutory period of

limitations for the commencement of medical malpractice actions
was two years.

(C) After discussing the case with the doctor's attorney, the attorney

came to the conclusion that the patient's case against the doctor was
weak.

(D) Cancer would have led to the patient's death within a few months if
left untreated, and the drug was the only drug available for its
treatment.

93. The defendant was an elderly man who lived in a house with a

swimming pool in the backyard. Although the defendant enjoyed
swimming in the pool, his age and physical infirmity made him unable

944

to clean or maintain the pool himself. Instead, he agreed to allow his
14-year-old neighbor, the plaintiff, to swim in the pool anytime she
wanted without notifying the defendant or asking his permission, in
exchange for the plaintiff's services in cleaning and maintaining the
pool.

On Friday morning, the plaintiff thoroughly cleaned the defendant's
pool. Later that day, the defendant drained all the water from the pool
and did not refill it. Saturday morning, the plaintiff woke up early and
decided to go swimming in the defendant's pool. She put on her
bathing suit and went into the defendant's yard, running onto the diving
board of his swimming pool and diving in without looking first. The
plaintiff was severely injured when she fell to the concrete bottom of
the empty swimming pool.

If the plaintiff asserts a negligence claim for her injuries against the
defendant in a jurisdiction that has a pure comparative negligence
statute, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the pool constituted an attractive nuisance.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff was a trespasser.

(C) the plaintiff, because it was unreasonable for the defendant to drain

the pool without warning her.

(D) the defendant, because a reasonable person in the plaintiff's
position would have known the risk of diving into an empty
swimming pool.

94. A playground was directly adjacent to a company's property, separated
from it by a 6-foot wire mesh fence. The company officials were
aware that a large gaping hole in this fence had existed for
approximately one year, and that children frequently crept through the
hole to play on the company's property.

One morning, the plaintiff, a 12-year-old student, entered the
company's property through the hole in the fence. The plaintiff began
climbing spikes that had been driven into a pole. When she reached a
wooden platform located 12 feet aboveground, she put her head
through the hole in its center to see what was above it. Her head came
into contact with a high-voltage wire that had been strung over the
platform, causing her to sustain serious injuries.

945

In a negligence action by the plaintiff against the company, which one
of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one
true, would provide the company with its most effective argument in
defense?

(A) The plaintiff entered the premises without the company's

permission.

(B) To the company's knowledge, no child had ever before attempted to

climb the pole.

(C) The plaintiff was old enough to comprehend the dangers associated

with an attempt to climb the pole.

(D) The fence that separated the company's property from the

schoolyard was located completely on realty occupied by the
school.

95. Several cases of explosives made by a company were shipped to a
buyer in another state to be stored in a warehouse pending delivery.
While the explosives were there, the warehouse facility was struck by
lightning, causing the explosives to explode. The cases containing the
explosives did not bear any description of their contents. If the
warehouse employees knew that the cases contained explosives, they
would have stored them in a way that would have prevented the
explosion. A homeowner who sustained property damage as a result of
the explosion has asserted a claim against the company.

Which of the following facts or inferences, if it were the only one true,
would provide the company with its most effective argument in
defense?

(A) The company did not do anything unreasonable or irresponsible in

manufacturing, packaging, or labeling its product.

(B) When the company shipped the cases of explosives, they had been
properly labeled with firmly affixed labels identifying their
contents, but the labels had somehow come off in transit.

(C) The company had assigned an employee to make sure that all cases
of explosives shipped by the company were properly labeled, but
the employee had forgotten to inspect this shipment.

(D) The storage of explosives by the warehouse was an ultra-hazardous

activity.

946

96. A restaurant opened on the edge of a college bar area, which abutted a
residential neighborhood. The restaurant had a walk-up window where
people could purchase food and drinks without going inside. The
restaurant and window were open until 4 A.M. every night. College
students soon started to congregate in front of the restaurant. On many
nights, the students were loud, and some even engaged in the use of
illegal drugs or drank alcohol underage. The plaintiff, who lived in a
house next to the new restaurant, complained and told the restaurant it
was bringing down his property value. He demanded that the restaurant
close at 11 P.M., like many other restaurants in the area. The restaurant
refused.

If the plaintiff chooses to sue, which of the following legal theories
would be most likely to result in a judgment for the plaintiff?

(A) Invasion of privacy.

(B) Intentional infliction of emotional distress.

(C) Trespass to land.

(D) Private nuisance.

97. During a comedian's long career in the entertainment business, the

comedian's trademark was always a cigar that he clenched between his
teeth or held in his hand while delivering his jokes. As part of an
interview on a television show, the interviewer asked the comedian
whether he really smoked cigars. The comedian replied, “Sure. I
always smoke these cigars. They're the best cigars made.”

The following day, the manufacturer of the cigars placed several
advertisements in newspapers. All the advertisements said, “Jimmy
Stoker the Famous Comedian says our cigars are the best cigars made.
He always smokes them, and you should too.”

If the comedian asserts a claim against the cigar company for invasion
of privacy by misappropriation of identity, the court should find for

(A) the cigar company, because the comedian had in fact made the

statement that appeared in the advertisement.

(B) the cigar company, because the advertisement constituted a
constitutionally protected form of commercial expression.

(C) the comedian, because when he made the statement on the

947

television show, it was unforeseeable that the cigar company
would use it in its advertising.

(D) the comedian, because the cigar company used his name to sell its

product without his permission.

98. The defendant grew fruit trees on her farm outside the village. In

addition, she operated a fruit store in the village. Every day during the
harvest season, in a trailer that she towed with her pickup truck, she
hauled fresh fruit from her orchards to her store. One day, as she was
towing the trailer filled with fruit up a hill on her way to the village,
the hitch that fastened the trailer to the pickup truck failed, permitting
the trailer to break loose and roll down the hill, striking and damaging
the home of the plaintiff. Subsequent investigation revealed that the
hitch failed because one of its parts was made of defective steel.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damage to his
house, the court's decision is most likely to turn on whether

(A) the defendant acted reasonably.

(B) the hitch was defective in manufacture or in design.

(C) the defendant was a merchant.

(D) the plaintiff could have foreseen the damage.

99. The pilot was a helicopter pilot employed by a radio station as a

traffic reporter. One day, while flying in his helicopter, he hovered
over the home of a woman. Using powerful binoculars, he looked into
her window to watch her while she was exercising in the nude. If the
woman institutes an action against him, which of the following facts or
inferences must she establish to make out a prima facie case of
trespass to land?

(A) The altitude at which the pilot hovered over her house.

(B) Damage to her land, or to her right to enjoy it, that resulted from the

pilot's conduct.

(C) That she had a reasonable expectation of privacy while exercising

nude in her own home.

(D) That she was in lawful possession of the premises at the time that

the pilot hovered over her house.

100. When a woman discovered that her car had been stolen, she reported

948

the theft to the police. Then, while she was walking home from the
police station, she saw her car in a homeowner's driveway, where the
person who stole it had abandoned it after using it in a bank robbery.
When she began walking toward the automobile, the homeowner ran
out of his house shouting, “Hey, you! Where do you think you're
going?” The woman explained that she was attempting to retrieve her
car, but the homeowner pushed her, saying, “Get off my land.” The
woman, who sustained no physical or mental injury as a result of the
homeowner's contact with her, got into her car and drove it away. The
woman subsequently commenced a battery action against the
homeowner. If, in response to the woman's claim, the homeowner
asserts the privilege to defend realty, the court should find for

(A) the homeowner, because the woman was not in hot pursuit of her

car when she entered the homeowner's realty.

(B) the homeowner, because the woman was not injured as a result of

his contact with her.

(C) the woman, because force is never permitted in defense of realty.

(D) the woman, because she was privileged to enter and retake her

automobile.

101. A husband's wife died when she jumped in front of a train owned by
the railroad. Two weeks later, a railroad employee contacted the
husband. The employee said that although the railroad was not legally
responsible for the wife's death, the railroad was willing to pay
$1,000 in full settlement of all claims arising from the wife's death.
When the husband said he wanted to speak with an attorney, the
employee told him that if an attorney got involved, the railroad would
not pay anything because the husband “had no legal claim.” The
husband doubted that the employee was telling the truth, so he
consulted with an attorney. The attorney didn't think the husband had a
claim and declined representation. Consequently, the husband accepted
the $1,000 and executed a general release. The husband then retained
another attorney and instituted a wrongful death action against the
railroad. The court dismissed, citing the release.

Which of the following additional facts must the husband prove to
establish a cause of action for misrepresentation against the employee?

(A) If the husband's wrongful death suit was not dismissed, it would
have resulted in a judgment for the husband in excess of $1,000.

949

(B) When the employee made the statements to the husband, the

employee knew or should have known that the statements were
false.

(C) The husband's wrongful death suit would have resulted in a

judgment for the husband in excess of $1,000, and the employee
knew or should have known the statements were false.

(D) The husband doesn't have to prove that his lawsuit would have
resulted in a judgment in excess of $1,000, or that the employee
knew or should have known his statements were false.

102. The company, a manufacturer of dog whistles, operated a factory for
that purpose. The whistles manufactured by the company issued a
sound so high-pitched that it could not be heard by human ears; only
dogs could hear it. For this reason, before leaving the assembly line,
each whistle was tested by a machine that blew air through it and
metered the sound that it made. After the company's factory had been in
operation for 15 years, a breeder moved onto the adjoining realty and
began operating a kennel. Two weeks after moving onto the realty, the
breeder discovered that the dogs in his kennel were being disturbed by
the testing of dog whistles in the company's factory. Although he told
the company about the problem, the company did not stop testing the
whistles. The breeder commenced a private nuisance action against it.
Which of the following would be the company's most effective
argument in defense against the breeder's claim?

(A) The operation of a dog-whistle factory is a lawful business.

(B) The breeder came to the nuisance.

(C) The company did not intend to cause harm to the breeder or to the

breeder's business.

(D) The breeder's damage resulted from the fact that the breeder was

making an unusually sensitive use of the land.

103. The plaintiff purchased a bottle of dishwashing detergent from the

defendant, a self-service supermarket. The plaintiff selected the
product from the defendant's shelves, carried it to a checkout counter,
and paid the cashier. The plaintiff then placed the bottle in a bag
furnished by the defendant and carried it home. The product purchased
by the plaintiff was manufactured by a local company. The product had
a label stating that it would not harm a user's skin. After using the

950

product for washing dishes, the plaintiff experienced a serious rash on
his hands and wrists as the result of an allergic reaction to a chemical
in the product.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for breach of
express warranty, a court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the label stated that the product would not

harm the skin of a user.

(B) the plaintiff, because the product was unfit for ordinary use.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff's injury resulted from reliance

on a statement that the company caused to be printed on the label of
its product.

(D) the defendant, because no employee of the defendant knew what
statements were contained on the company's detergent label.

104. The defendant bought a new sailboat, although he had never been on

one before. Although the defendant had not received any instruction at
all, and although he heard a weather report that warned of severe
storms, he decided to take the boat out for a test sail by himself. A few
minutes after he left the dock with his boat, the storm struck, causing
high and dangerous waves. Fearful that the defendant would be killed
at sea, the defendant's wife stood crying on the shore. The plaintiff, an
experienced sailor who knew the defendant and the defendant's wife,
heard the defendant's wife crying about her husband's predicament.
Without saying anything to the defendant's wife, the plaintiff went out
in his own boat to look for the defendant. The defendant returned
unhurt an hour later, but the plaintiff's boat capsized in the storm,
severely damaging his boat and causing the plaintiff to sustain injury.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for the damage that
he sustained, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because his damage resulted from the defendant's

failure to act reasonably.

(B) the plaintiff, because a rescuer is entitled to indemnity from the

person whom he or she was attempting to rescue.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff was an officious intermeddler.

(D) the defendant, because the defendant was unaware that the plaintiff

951

would attempt to rescue him.

105. The defendant was driving to visit her fiancé. Before she left, her

friend asked her to deliver a small package to someone. The package
contained a bottle of caustic chemicals. Because she was afraid that
the defendant would refuse to carry it if she knew its contents, the
friend wrapped the package in brown paper and did not tell the
defendant what was in it. The defendant placed the package in the
glove compartment of her car and began driving. Along the way, the
defendant saw the plaintiff hitchhiking by the side of the road. The
defendant offered the plaintiff a ride. While the plaintiff was sitting in
the front seat, the plaintiff opened the glove compartment and removed
the wet package. As soon as the caustic liquid touched the plaintiff's
hand, it burned his skin severely.

If the plaintiff commences a negligence action against the defendant in
a jurisdiction that has no automobile guest statute and that applies the
all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence, which of the following
would be the defendant's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff was a mere licensee and was entitled only to a
warning of those conditions that the defendant knew were
dangerous.

(B) The defendant could not have known or anticipated that the contents

of the package would cause harm to a passenger in her car.

(C) The plaintiff was contributorily negligent in touching the wet

package.

(D) The plaintiff assumed the risk of injury resulting from contact with

the wet package.

106. The plaintiff decided to have a rosebud tattooed on her shoulder.

While the defendant was tattooing the plaintiff's shoulder, the tattoo
needle broke off in the plaintiff's skin, injuring the plaintiff. If the
plaintiff asserts a strict liability claim against the defendant on the
ground that the tattoo needle that the defendant used was defective, the
defendant's most effective argument in defense would be that

(A) the defendant did not sell the needle to the plaintiff.

(B) the defendant was not the manufacturer of the needle and therefore

had no control over its quality.

952

(C) the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury.

(D) a tattoo needle is not an inherently dangerous product.

107. When a policeman saw a walker hurrying down the street in the early

morning darkness, he pulled his car over to the curb and ordered the
walker to stop and identify himself. The walker showed the policeman
his license, told him that he lived only a few blocks away, and
explained that he was just taking a walk. When the policeman told the
walker to get into the back of the patrol car, the walker asked whether
he was under arrest. The policeman replied, “No, but if you know
what's good for you, you'll get into the car and shut up while I decide
what to do with you.” The walker got into the car and sat quietly in the
backseat with the door open while the policeman called the walker's
description in to police headquarters over the radio. About 15 minutes
later, satisfied that the walker was not wanted for violating any law,
the policeman told him that he could go. When he was leaving the car,
the walker scraped his finger. If the walker asserts a claim against the
policeman for false imprisonment, the court should find for

(A) the policeman, because the rear door of the policeman's patrol car

remained open all the time that the walker sat in the car.

(B) the policeman, because the walker did not object to sitting in the

patrol car.

(C) the walker, because the language used by the policeman induced the

walker to obey the policeman's order.

(D) the walker, because he sustained damage as a result of his detention

by the policeman.

108. A driver hit a pole, causing a power failure. At the time of the power

failure, a patient was undergoing facial surgery in a hospital operating
room. The hospital's emergency generator went on automatically,
supplying enough electrical power to light the operating room dimly.
The doctor who was operating on the patient was able to complete the
surgery on the patient's face, but the operation left the patient with
permanent and disfiguring scars. If the power had not failed, the doctor
would have been able to prevent the scarring.

If the patient asserts a claim for negligence against the driver, which of
the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one
true, would provide the driver with his most effective defense?

953

(A) The reasonable surgeon in the doctor's position would not have

proceeded with the operation while the operating room was dimly
lit by the hospital's emergency generator.

(B) The reasonable person in the driver's position would not have
anticipated that hitting a pole would affect any person at the
hospital.

(C) The doctor was guilty of aggravated negligence in continuing to
operate on the patient under the circumstances then existing.

(D) The patient's scarring was caused by the conduct of the doctor.

109. The plaintiff and the defendant were sportswriters who wrote for
competing newspapers in the city. Because most of the plaintiff's
articles praised his home team, and most of the defendant's articles
praised his home team, a rivalry developed between the plaintiff and
the defendant. One of the defendant's recent columns contained the
following statement:

[Plaintiff]'s team can't play ball, and [plaintiff] can't write his way out
of  a  paper  bag.  The  only  thing  more  boring  than  reading  [plaintiff]'s
stuff is reading it while watching his team play.

If the plaintiff commences an action for defamation against the
defendant, which of the following would be the defendant's most
effective argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff is a public figure.

(B) The statements made by the defendant were expressions of opinion.

(C) The defendant's occupation makes him a media defendant.

(D) The defendant's statements were privileged by the defense of

competition.

110. A manufacturer built and sold a machine to a steel mill. Two years

later, the steel mill sold the machine to a small computer parts startup.
The manufacturer discovered that a screw in the machine would wear
down and break within three years. It learned the startup had
purchased the machine, and offered to repair the defective screw for
$1,000, which was what it would cost the manufacturer to make the
repair. The startup did not want to spend that much money to fix the
machine. Six months later, the screw snapped and an employee was
injured.

954

The employee sued the manufacturer on a theory of strict liability.
During trial, the jury found the worn screw made the machine
defective when it was sold to the steel mill, the machine had not been
substantially changed since the first sale, and the defective screw was
the proximate cause of the employee's injury. The jury should find in
favor of

(A) the employee, because he was injured by the defective screw.

(B) the employee, because the manufacturer's demand for $1,000 was

unreasonable.

(C) the company, because the machine was removed from the stream of

commerce when the steel mill sold it.

(D) the company, because the startup's refusal to pay the cost of the

repair was unreasonable.

111. At 9 A.M., a man parked his car on a road in front of the play yard of the
elementary school. At the time that he parked the car, the man knew
that he was violating a statute that prohibited parking within two
blocks of any elementary school. At 10 A.M. on the same day, because
she was driving at an unreasonably fast rate of speed, a woman lost
control of her car and struck the man's parked vehicle. The impact
caused a passenger in the woman's car to be thrown against the
windshield, severely cutting her face and rendering her unconscious. If
the man's car had not been parked where it was, the woman would
have collided with a six-foot concrete wall that surrounded the school
play yard.

If the passenger asserts a negligence claim against the man, which of
the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one true,
would be most likely to lead to a judgment for the man?

(A) The statute that prohibited parking within two blocks of any
elementary school was designed to protect schoolchildren.

(B) The accident would not have occurred if the woman had not been

operating her vehicle in an unreasonable manner.

(C) If the woman's car had hit the concrete wall, the passenger would

have sustained injuries as serious as those sustained in the
collision with the man's car.

(D) The woman's unreasonable driving was an intervening cause of

955

harm.

112. A jury found that the plaintiff was damaged to the extent of $100,000.
The jury further found that the plaintiff's damage was caused 20
percent by the plaintiff's negligence, 40 percent by one defendant's
negligence, and 40 percent by another defendant's negligence. The
jurisdiction had a statute that read as follows:

In  a  negligence  action,  no  plaintiff  shall  be  barred  from  recovery
because  of  that  plaintiff's  contributory  negligence,  but  such  plaintiff's
recovery shall be diminished in proportion to plaintiff's own fault.

The court held that the two defendants were jointly and severally
liable for the plaintiff's damage and entered judgment for the plaintiff
consistent with the jury's verdict.

The first defendant became insolvent following the entry of judgment.
How much money is the plaintiff entitled to collect from the second
defendant?

(A) $100,000.

(B) $80,000 ($100,000 less 20 percent).

(C) $40,000 (40 percent of $100,000).

(D) None.

113. While the plaintiff was shopping at a sporting goods store owned by

the defendant, another customer assaulted the plaintiff with a baseball
bat. The plaintiff sued the defendant for his damages. The could should
find

(A) the defendant liable under the principle of vicarious liability.

(B) the defendant liable under the principle of general liability.

(C) the defendant liable under the principle of strict liability.

(D) the defendant not liable.

114. A magazine contained an article about the recent sale of an old house

that had once been owned by a United States President. The article
stated that the home had been purchased by the plaintiff for $950,000.
It described the plaintiff as a bank president earning a salary of
$100,000 per year and stated that she had purchased the home with
part of the $1 million fortune that she inherited from her mother.

956

Writers of the article had obtained information about the sale from
public records of the Office of the County Recorder. Information about
the plaintiff's employment and salary had been obtained from public
records of the state Department of Banks, and information about her
inheritance from public records of the state Probate Court. All
statements made in the article were accurate.

The plaintiff asserts a claim for invasion of privacy on the ground that
the article publicly disclosed facts about her salary and inheritance.
The court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because most members of the general public were

unfamiliar with records of the state Department of Banks and the
state Probate Court.

(B) the plaintiff, because there is no right to publish information

regarding the personal wealth of a person who is not a public
employee.

(C) the magazine, because liability cannot be imposed for publication

of the truth.

(D) the magazine, because the plaintiff's salary and inheritance were a

matter of public record.

115. A landowner lived in a cabin in the area. After a nearby factory began
using unbagged cement, cement dust from the factory's operation
continually settled on the cabin that the landowner occupied. Although
the dust did no physical harm to the cabin or to the landowner, the
landowner complained to officials of the factory that the dust annoyed
her. Because the factory received no other complaints from other area
residents, however, it continued using unbagged cement.

If the landowner wishes to assert a tort claim against the factory on
account of the cement dust that continually settles on the cabin, which
of the following would be her most effective theory?

(A) Invasion of privacy.

(B) Public nuisance.

(C) Trespass to land.

(D) Strict liability for engaging in an abnormally dangerous activity.

116. An employee was driving a pickup truck owned by the company when

957

he collided with an automobile owned and operated by a driver. A
passenger in the driver's car subsequently asserted a claim against the
company, the employee, and the driver for injuries sustained in the
accident. At trial, the jury fixed the amount of the passenger's damages
and found that the employee was 40 percent at fault, the driver was 60
percent at fault, and the passenger was not at fault. In issuing a
judgment for the passenger, the court held that the employee and the
driver were jointly and severally liable for the passenger's injuries
and that the company was vicariously liable for the employee's tort.
The jurisdiction had statutes that adopted pure comparative negligence
and recognized a right of contribution between joint tortfeasors.

In enforcing the judgment, what portion of her damages is the
passenger entitled to collect from the employee?

(A) 0 percent

(B) 40 percent

(C) 50 percent

(D) 100 percent

117. In a negligence action by the plaintiff against two defendants, the court
found that the plaintiff's injuries were proximately caused by the
combined negligence of the two defendants and that they were jointly
and severally liable to the plaintiff in the sum of $100,000. The court
also found that in producing the plaintiff's injury, the first defendant
was 40 percent at fault and the second defendant was 60 percent at
fault. The jurisdiction has a statute recognizing the right of contribution
between joint tortfeasors, and that contribution shall be based on
apportionment of fault.

After the entry of judgment, the plaintiff succeeded in collecting
$10,000 from the first defendant. Which of the following correctly
states the amount that the plaintiff is entitled to collect from the second
defendant?

(A) $50,000 (60 percent of $100,000 minus $10,000 already

collected).

(B) $60,000 (60 percent of $100,000).

(C) $90,000 ($100,000 minus $10,000 already collected).

958

(D) $100,000.

118. A plaintiff was in an auto accident with the defendant. After a jury

trial, the jury found that the plaintiff's damage was $100,000. The jury
also found the accident was 25 percent the fault of the defendant, and
75 percent the fault of the plaintiff. A statute in the relevant jurisdiction
imposes a system of pure comparative negligence.

Based on the jury's findings, the court should enter judgment for

(A) the defendant, because he was only 25 percent at fault.

(B) the plaintiff, in the amount of $25,000.

(C) the plaintiff, in the amount of $75,000.

(D) the plaintiff, in the amount of $100,000.

119. During the course of an argument about politics, the defendant slapped
the plaintiff in the face. Angry, the plaintiff pointed an unloaded pistol
at the defendant. The defendant immediately drew a knife and stabbed
the plaintiff with it, injuring him severely. The plaintiff subsequently
asserted a battery claim against the defendant. The only defense raised
by the defendant was self-defense.

In determining the defendant's liability to the plaintiff, the most
important issue that must be decided is whether

(A) the use of a knife by the defendant constituted deadly force.

(B) the defendant knew or should have known that he could safely and

easily retreat without sustaining harm.

(C) the defendant was the initial aggressor.

(D) the plaintiff knew that his pistol was unloaded.

120. The defendant kept an extremely tame lion as a pet. The lion had

worked in a circus for most of its life and had never attacked anyone in
all the years it was performing. Now, the lion was old, practically
blind, and had lost all of its teeth. Without any negligence by the
defendant, the lion escaped from the defendant's backyard and walked
to the plaintiff's home, which was over one mile away. Finding the
front door open and smelling some steak cooking, the lion walked
through the front door and into the plaintiff's kitchen. When the plaintiff
saw the lion she panicked and dropped a boiling pot of grease onto her

959

foot. She suffered severe burns as a result. The plaintiff sued the
defendant for damages. The court should find

(A) the defendant not liable because the lion had never shown any

propensity to harm a person.

(B) the defendant not liable because the defendant was not negligent.

(C) the defendant not liable because the injury was not the result of the

lion's dangerous propensities.

(D) the defendant liable for the plaintiff's injuries.

121. The owner of a supermarket purchased an automatic door-opener from

its manufacturer. The device included rubber step-plates that were to
be installed on the floor on both sides of the door. When a person
stepped on one of the step-plates, the machine was designed to swing
the door away from him or her.

The store owner hired a contractor to install the automatic door-
opener while the store was closed for the night. The contractor read
the instructions furnished by the manufacturer but disregarded the
warnings. When he finished installing the device, he did not test it by
stepping on one of the step-plates but advised the store's night manager
that the job was complete. The following morning when the store
opened, a customer was injured by the door.

The customer asserted a claim for his injuries against the store owner.
Which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
customer?

(A) The customer's injury resulted from a defect in the step-plate.

(B) The contractor was not negligent in his installation of the automatic

door-opener.

(C) A reasonable inspection by the store owner would have disclosed

that the door opened improperly.

(D) The customer made a purchase from the store owner before being

struck by the door.

122. The plaintiff, an adult, took his neighbor's seven-year-old son to see

the circus. During the show, many children left their seats to watch the
performance from the edge of the area on which it took place. The boy

960

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

did so with the plaintiff's permission. When the circus's trained lions
were performing, one of the animals got away from its enclosure and
struck the boy with its paw, injuring him. Horrified, the plaintiff ran
from his seat and chased the lion away from the boy. The plaintiff was
not touched by the lion but became highly nervous as a result of the
incident. The circus knew that the lions would often attack people. The
jurisdiction applied the doctrine of transferred intent.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim for battery against the circus, the court
should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the jurisdiction applies the doctrine of

transferred intent.

(B) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff experienced mental suffering as a

result of harmful contact inflicted upon the boy.

(C) the circus, because the plaintiff was not touched by the lion.

(D) the circus, because the circus knew that the lions would attack a

member of the audience when the circus exhibited them.

123. One weekend, while the plaintiff's son was visiting with her ex-

husband, a friend of the plaintiff's phoned her. The friend said that she
heard that the ex-husband was planning to remove the boy from the
state permanently.

Panicked, the plaintiff ran to the home of the ex-husband's father and
pounded on the door. When the ex-husband's father came to the door,
the plaintiff demanded, in a loud voice, that the ex-husband's father tell
her where her ex-husband and her son were. The ex-husband's father
knew that the ex-husband had taken the boy to the movies and would
soon be returning. Because the plaintiff's manner frightened him,
however, the ex-husband's father said that he had no idea where they
were or when they were coming back and refused to talk to the
plaintiff any further.

As a result, the plaintiff became highly upset. She visited her
physician, who prescribed a mild tranquilizer, but she remained
nervous until the ex-husband brought the boy to her home that evening.

The plaintiff asserted a claim against the ex-husband's father for false
imprisonment. The court should find for

961

(A) the ex-husband's father, because the plaintiff sustained no physical

injury as a result of the incident.

(B) the ex-husband's father, because he did not prevent the plaintiff

from leaving his home.

(C) the plaintiff, because she was legally entitled to custody of the boy.

(D) the plaintiff, because the ex-husband's father prevented her from

seeing or communicating with the boy.

124. The defendant's car struck and killed a boy, flinging the child and his

tricycle through the air.

The plaintiff was standing in her living room when she heard the
screech of the defendant's brakes. Glancing out through her window,
she saw the boy's bloody body fly through the air and land on her front
lawn. The plaintiff was so shocked by what she saw that she suffered a
heart attack and needed to be hospitalized for several weeks.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from mental distress that she experienced because of the
incident, which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if it
was the only one true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for
the plaintiff?

(A) The reasonable person would have expected someone to be in the
plaintiff's position and to experience mental suffering as a result of
the incident.

(B) The jurisdiction applies the doctrine of transferred intent.

(C) The jurisdiction applies the doctrine of transferred consequences.

(D) The reasonable person would regard the defendant's speed as

outrageous.

125. A homeowner hired a painter to paint the outside of the homeowner's

house. While doing so, the painter left his ladder unattended on the
front lawn.

Two days later, a government employee was walking across the
homeowner's lawn while delivering mail. On several occasions in the
past, the homeowner had asked her to use the sidewalk and not to walk
on his lawn. The homeowner saw the employee walking toward the

962

painter's ladder on his lawn but did not warn the employee because he
believed that she saw it. Although the lawn had recently been mowed
and the ladder was in plain view, the employee did not see the ladder
and tripped over it, injuring her knee.

The jurisdiction applies the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence.

If the employee asserts a negligence claim against the homeowner for
damages resulting from her injury, which of the following would be
the homeowner's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The homeowner did not know with certainty that the employee

would be injured.

(B) The dangerous condition was created by the painter.

(C) The homeowner believed that the employee knew that the ladder

was there.

(D) A landowner owes no duty to government employees entering on

official business.

126. Six months after a doctor performed surgery on her, a patient was X-

rayed by another doctor. The X-ray disclosed a surgical instrument
inside the patient's chest. The first doctor was the only person who had
ever performed surgery on the patient. The patient subsequently
asserted a medical malpractice claim against the doctor, alleging that
the doctor had negligently left the surgical instrument inside her while
operating on her.

If an expert testifies that surgeons do not usually leave instruments
inside a patient's body unless they are acting unreasonably, may the
patient rely on res ipsa loquitur in her claim against the doctor?

(A) No, because the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not applicable to a

claim for professional malpractice.

(B) No, because a jury of laypersons is not competent to infer that a

physician was negligent.

(C) Yes, because a surgeon is under an absolute duty not to leave

instruments inside a patient's body.

(D) Yes, because the doctor was the only person who had ever

963

performed surgery on the patient.

127. The defendants were driving their vehicles in an unreasonable manner

when they collided. The collision caused the first driver's vehicle to
strike and injure a pedestrian who was crossing the street in the middle
of the block. The pedestrian was hospitalized as a result of the
accident, but he had hospitalization insurance that paid $10,000
toward his hospital bill.

The pedestrian subsequently asserted a claim against both defendants.
At the trial, in response to the judge's instructions, the jury found that
the pedestrian sustained damages of $100,000, and that the accident
resulted 40 percent from the negligence of the first driver, 40 percent
from the negligence of the second driver, and 20 percent from the
negligence of the pedestrian. The judge ruled that the defendants were
jointly and severally liable to the pedestrian and entered judgment in
accordance with the jury's verdict.

Which of the following statements correctly describes the amount that
the pedestrian is entitled to collect from the first driver in a
jurisdiction that has a pure comparative negligence statute?

(A) $100,000 reduced by 20 percent.

(B) $100,000 reduced by $10,000 and further reduced by 20 percent.

(C) 40 percent of $100,000.

(D) 40 percent of the amount derived by subtracting $10,000 from

$100,000.

128. The defendant, a power company, built a large nuclear power plant. It
did so with utmost care, and the plant went far beyond the safety
measures required by federal guidelines. The plant sat on the edge of a
small harbor that had a beach that was extremely popular for fishing.
The plaintiff went to the harbor every day to fish. Because the plaintiff
was also extremely proud of his dark tan, he fished with his shirt off,
surrounded by mirrors he placed in the sand so the sun reached all
sides of his body evenly. After three years, the plaintiff developed an
extremely rare form of cancer that was linked to radiation escaping
from the plant. The radiation leak was so small that it could not be
detected, and in fact was only discovered because the plaintiff became
sick. If the plaintiff had not fished surrounded by mirrors, it was
unlikely he would have gotten sick or that the leak would have been

964

discovered at all. The plaintiff sued the defendant for his injuries.
During trial, the defendant proved that it was not negligent in any way.
The jurisdiction used common law contributory negligence principles.
The court should rule in favor of

(A) the defendant, because the defendant was not negligent.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff's use of the mirrors was

contributory negligence.

(C) the defendant, because the leak was impossible to discover before

the plaintiff was injured.

(D) the plaintiff.

129. One evening in a tavern, a 17-year-old girl drank alcoholic beverages.
The girl then left and went to the tavern next door, where she drank
alcoholic beverages. The girl attempted to ride home on her
motorcycle. Because the girl was intoxicated, she struck and injured a
pedestrian. The pedestrian subsequently asserted claims against both
taverns under a state law that provides as follows: “If a minor under
the age of 20 years injures another while intoxicated, any person who
sold said minor the alcohol that resulted in said minor's intoxication
shall be liable to the injured person.”

The first tavern did not sell the girl enough alcohol to make the girl
intoxicated, and the alcohol that the second tavern sold the girl would
have made the girl intoxicated even if the first tavern had sold the girl
no alcohol at all. In determining the pedestrian's claim against the
second tavern, the court should find that

(A) the second tavern's conduct was not the cause of the girl's

intoxication because the first tavern's conduct was a substantial
factor in making the girl intoxicated.

(B) the second tavern is liable under the statute even if the second
tavern's conduct did not cause the girl to become intoxicated.

(C) the second tavern's conduct was a cause of the pedestrian's injury
because the girl would not have become intoxicated if the second
tavern did not sell the girl alcoholic beverages.

(D) the second tavern's conduct was a cause of the girl's intoxication
but was not a cause of the pedestrian's injury because the girl's
driving superseded it.

965

130. A contractor told the landowner that she did not think that one pillar

would provide sufficient support for the landowner's staircase. When
the landowner discussed the contractor's objection with the architect,
however, the architect insisted that one pillar would be sufficient. The
landowner told this to the contractor and convinced the contractor to
rely on the architect's plan.

The contractor completed the building as agreed and turned it over to
the landowner on April 1. Two weeks later, the landowner hired a
mover to move a piano onto the second floor of the house. While the
mover was carrying the piano up the staircase, the staircase collapsed,
causing the mover to sustain injury. If the staircase had been supported
by two columns, it would not have collapsed.

If the mover asserts a negligence claim against the contractor, the court
should declare that

(A) the contractor assumed the risk because she supported the stairway
with only one pillar even though she was aware of the danger of
doing so.

(B) the contractor is not liable because she had turned the building over

to the landowner prior to the accident.

(C) the contractor is not liable because it was reasonable for her to rely

on the architect's instructions in constructing the stairway.

(D) the contractor absolved herself of the risk by objecting to

supporting the stairway with only one pillar.

131. A man was obviously intoxicated when he entered a bartender's tavern

one night and ordered a drink of whiskey. A statute in the jurisdiction
prohibits serving alcoholic liquor to any intoxicated person. The
bartender knew that the man was intoxicated, but because the man was
a good customer, the bartender opened a new bottle and poured him
some of it. After drinking the liquor, the man left the tavern and began
driving home.

Before the whiskey left the factory, an angry employee added a poison
to it that could not have been discovered by reasonable inspection.
While the man was driving in a reasonable manner, the poison caused
him to die. As a result, the man's car struck a pedestrian, injuring her.

966

If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the factory, the court should
find for

(A) the factory, because the employee deliberately poisoned the liquor

before it left the factory.

(B) the factory, because the pedestrian did not purchase or consume the

factory's product.

(C) the pedestrian, because the liquor contained poison when it left the

factory.

(D) the factory, because the poison could not have been detected by

reasonable inspection.

132. Pursuant to a contract with the federal government, a rocket company
manufactured and launched rockets used for placing communications
satellites into space. Shortly after the rocket company launched one of
its rockets, the rocket exploded in the air. It then crashed into a storage
building owned by a medical company that contained antibiotics with a
value of $180 million, totally destroying the building and its contents.
No one could determine the cause of the explosion. Although the rocket
company used reasonable care in all aspects of the manufacturing and
launching process, a few of the rocket company's rockets had exploded
in the past shortly after launch. Each time this happened, the rocket
involved was completely destroyed while in the air and caused no
damage on the ground.

If the medical company asserts a claim against the rocket company for
the loss of its building and contents, the court should find for

(A) the medical company, because the construction and launching of

rockets is an abnormally dangerous activity.

(B) the medical company, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.

(C) the rocket company, because the reasonable person would not

expect antibiotics worth $180 million to be stored in one building.

(D) the rocket company, because none of the rocket company's rockets

caused any damage on the ground in the past.

133. Due to an error at its factory, a company sold an airline a belt truck

that did not have an acceleration suppressor.

Two months later, the airline went out of business and sold the belt

967

truck to a second airline. An independent contractor hired by the
second airline to maintain the second airline's equipment set the belt
idle above 15. Doing so can cause the truck to lurch forward unless it
is equipped with an acceleration suppressor. The company was aware
that people who maintain the trucks often set the idle above 15.
Subsequently, an employee of the second airline attempted to activate
the belt while standing beside the belt truck. She was injured when the
belt truck lurched forward and struck her.

The employee asserts a claim against the company on the ground that
the absence of an acceleration suppressor made the belt truck
defective. The court should find for

(A) the company, because the first airline was negligent in failing to

discover that the belt truck was not equipped with an acceleration
suppressor.

(B) the company, because if the contractor had acted reasonably in
setting the belt idle, the employee would not have been injured.

(C) the employee, because persons who maintain belt trucks frequently

set the belt idle above 15.

(D) the employee, because the negligence of the contractor is imputed

to the company.

134. A company operated a manufacturing plant just outside the town,

making an insecticide that was very important to the state's orange
crop. Breezes frequently carried fumes from the company's plant into
the town. Although the fumes did not violate state air pollution laws,
they caused many buildings in the town to need frequent repainting and
led many homeowners to complain about it to the company. The
company did nothing about it, however, because the cost of eliminating
the fumes was extremely high.

A homeowner, who owned a house in the town in which he resided
with his son, had to repaint his house several times because of the
fumes.

The homeowner asserted a private nuisance claim against the company
for the damage to his paint, asserting that the company was negligent in
failing to eliminate the fumes. Which of the following would be the
company's most effective argument in defense against the homeowner's

968

claim?

(A) The operation of the company's plant did not result in a physical

invasion of the homeowner's realty.

(B) The fumes affected others in substantially the same way as they

affected the homeowner.

(C) The company officials did not know that the fumes would affect the

paint of the homeowner's house.

(D) The cost of eliminating the fumes would have driven the company

out of business.

135. A company was the manufacturer of a product that was sold over the

counter for the treatment of dandruff and dry scalp conditions. The
plaintiff purchased a bottle at a local drugstore. A statement on the
label read, “This product will not harm normal scalp or hair.” The
plaintiff used the product as directed. Because of a scalp condition
making him allergic to one of the ingredients, the product irritated his
scalp, causing him much pain and discomfort.

In an action by the plaintiff against the company on the theory of strict
liability in tort, which of the following additional facts or inferences,
if it was the only one true, would be most helpful to the plaintiff's
case?

(A) Injuries of the kind sustained by the plaintiff do not ordinarily result
from the use of a product like this one unless the manufacturer was
negligent.

(B) Prior to the plaintiff's purchase of the product, an article regarding
the allergy from which he suffered had appeared in a widely read
journal of the hair-care industry.

(C) The ordinary consumer would not have expected the use of the

product to result in an irritation of the scalp of someone with the
plaintiff's allergy.

(D) At the time it manufactured the product purchased by the plaintiff,
the company was aware that its ingredients could irritate the scalp
of persons with allergies like the plaintiff's.

136. The city sidewalk in front of the defendant's business was often

covered with leaves that made the sidewalk slippery. To try to fix
matters, the defendant made a deal with the city, giving the defendant

969

possession and control of the trees. The defendant then swept the
leaves off the sidewalk every morning. One morning, the defendant
failed to sweep, and the plaintiff, who was walking into the business
on his way to a meeting, slipped on the leaves and fell, cracking his
head open. The plaintiff was texting on his phone when he fell, but he
had walked into the building every day for weeks and reasonably
believed that the leaves would be swept because of the past conduct of
the defendant. The plaintiff sued, and the defendant defended himself
by asserting he had no duty to sweep the leaves off the sidewalk under
the circumstances.

How should the court rule?

(A) In favor of the defendant, because the sidewalk was city property.

(B) In favor of the defendant, because the plaintiff was texting when he

fell.

(C) In favor of the plaintiff, because the defendant had possession and

control of the trees.

(D) In favor of the plaintiff, because the defendant's past conduct made

the plaintiff reasonably believe the leaves would be swept

137. A farmer owned 500 acres of land on which she grew wheat. By a
valid written contract, she agreed to deliver all her wheat to a
company to be used by that company in the production of bread for
sale to the general public. While harvesting the crop, she realized that
a blade on her harvesting machine was broken and that fine slivers of
metal were becoming mixed with the wheat. She said nothing about
this when she delivered the wheat to the company, since she knew that
the company ordinarily cleaned its wheat before using it.

The bread company used the wheat that it purchased from the farmer to
manufacture a loaf of bread that it sold to a sandwich shop. The
sandwich shop owner used the bread to make a sandwich. Because the
bread contained slivers of the blade from the farmer's harvesting
machine, the customer who bought the sandwich lacerated the lining of
his throat when he tried to eat it.

In an action by the customer against the bread company, can the
customer successfully rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur?

(A) Yes, because the exercise of reasonable care in the baking process

970

would ordinarily have eliminated all metal slivers from the wheat.

(B) Yes, because the presence of metal slivers made the bread

defective.

(C) No, because the presence of the metal slivers in the wheat resulted

from the farmer's failure to use reasonable care.

(D) No, because it was unforeseeable that a broken blade on the

farmer's harvesting machine would result in the presence of metal
slivers in the wheat.

138. A kidnapper falsely claimed he was holding a girl hostage. In reality,
the girl was on a camping trip. The girl's mother remained in a
hysterical state until the girl returned from her camping trip and the
girl's mother realized that it had been a hoax. The girl's mother, who
already suffered from a heart ailment, had a heart attack the day after
the girl's return.

If the girl's mother asserts a claim against the kidnapper for damages
resulting from her heart attack on a theory of intentional infliction of
emotional distress, the court should find for

(A) the kidnapper, because the heart attack occurred the day after the

girl's return.

(B) the kidnapper, because the mother's preexisting condition made her

especially susceptible to heart attack.

(C) the girl's mother, because the heart attack was caused by the

kidnapper's outrageous conduct.

(D) the girl's mother, because the kidnapper should have foreseen that

his conduct would result in harm.

139. While the plaintiff was visiting her daughter, the two of them decided
to go swimming at a nearby public pool. Since she had not brought a
bathing suit along on her visit, the plaintiff went to a department store
to purchase one. While looking at the suits on the bargain counter, she
found one made by a bathing suit company. The package that contained
it bore a label that read, “Disposable Bathing Suit. This garment is
made completely from recycled paper. Although it is strong enough to
be worn several times and is even washable, it's inexpensive enough
to be thrown away after one use.” The plaintiff bought the suit and then
went to the beach. The first time she was hit by a wave, however, the

971

suit completely disintegrated.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most helpful to the department store's defense
in an action by the plaintiff against the department store?

(A) The department store had sold the bathing suit company's products
for several years and had never heard of any problem like the one
experienced by the plaintiff.

(B) A sign on the bargain counter where the plaintiff found the suit said,

“Sale Merchandise. All sales final.”

(C) The plaintiff knew that paper bathing suits like the one she had
purchased sometimes dissolved when they became wet.

(D) The department store could not implead the bathing suit company
into the action because the company had gone out of business.

140. A 13-year-old boy and his family lived on a farm in a very remote

portion of the state. Because of the lack of automobile traffic, the boy's
parents let him ride a motorcycle between the family farm and the
local grocery store. There was no statute or ordinance that prohibited
the boy's use of the motorcycle. One morning, there was heavy fog on
the ground when the boy drove the motorcycle to the store. The speed
limit was 35 miles per hour. While a reasonable adult would have
known to drive under the speed limit because of the poor visibility, a
reasonable 13-year-old would not normally have such knowledge. The
boy drove the motorcycle at 35 miles an hour and crashed into a car
when he was unable to slow down in time. The boy did not expect a
car to be on the road, because cars were so rarely around. The car
owner sued the boy for negligence. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the car owner, because the boy was driving a motorcycle.

(B) the car owner, because a reasonable adult would have known to

drive under the speed limit.

(C) the boy, because a reasonable 13-year-old would not normally

know to drive under the speed limit.

(D) the boy, because he was driving at the speed limit.

141. The company manufactured a device for training dogs. A professional

dog trainer was working with a dog in her unfenced front yard and was
using the company's brand new device. A man was walking past the

972

yard when the dog began to snarl and lunge at him. When the trainer
yanked on the leather strap of the device, it suddenly broke, freeing the
dog. The dog sprang forward, biting the walker.

If the walker asserts a claim against the dog trainer, the walker's most
effective argument in support of his claim would be that

(A) the dog trainer is strictly liable for damage resulting from her use

of a defective product.

(B) it was unreasonable for the dog trainer to work the dog in her front

yard.

(C) the dog trainer's conduct was a concurring cause of harm.

(D) the dog trainer was a professional dog trainer.

142. Because the plaintiff had a headache, he took two headache tablets

from a bottle that had been purchased by his wife at the grocery store.
The tablets had been manufactured by the company, which sold them to
the grocery store in sealed bottles for resale. Because of a toxic
ingredient that the tablets contained, the plaintiff became ill as a result
of taking them.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the company based on a theory of
strict liability in tort, the ruling should turn on the question of whether

(A) the company knew that the tablets contained a toxic ingredient.

(B) headache tablets that contain a toxic ingredient are inherently

dangerous.

(C) it was reasonable for the company to market the tablets.

(D) the presence of the toxic material was a defect.

143. A driver was looking for an address as he drove down the street and

was not watching the road in front of him. As a result, he did not see a
pedestrian crossing the street in front of him and struck her with his
car, knocking her down. The driver immediately got out of her car to
help the pedestrian. When he saw that she was unconscious, he became
afraid to move her and left her in the roadway while he ran to a nearby
phone. While the driver was gone, a taxi drove down the same street.
The taxi did not see the pedestrian in the roadway, and drove over her,
fracturing her leg.

973

In an action by the pedestrian against the driver for damages resulting
from her fractured leg, a court is most likely to find for

(A) the pedestrian, because the driver's negligence was a factual and

legal cause of the pedestrian's fractured leg.

(B) the pedestrian, since the negligence of the taxi is imputed to the

driver.

(C) the driver, since his conduct was a legal cause but not a factual

cause of the pedestrian's fractured leg.

(D) the driver, because the pedestrian would not have been injured but

for the taxi striking her.

144. An employee resigned after being told he wouldn't be compensated for
extra work hours. At the same time, he told his former employer he
would retain a set of tools issued to him until he received payment.
The employee applied for a job with another company, and that
company wrote to the former employer asking for an evaluation of the
employee's honesty and ability. The former employer wrote a letter to
the other company that stated, “When the employee left my company,
he stole a valuable set of tools.” As a result, the other company did not
hire the employee. If the employee asserts a claim against his former
employer for defamation, the employee should

(A) lose, because the employee did not return the tools that he took

when he left the employer's employ.

(B) lose, because the employer's statement was made in response to a

specific request by the employee's prospective employer.

(C) win, because the employer's statement could not have benefitted the

employer's business interests.

(D) win, because the employer's statement accused the employee of

stealing tools.

145. The defendant operated a train carrying high explosives used to blow

tunnels through mountains. As the train was passing through a city, it hit
the plaintiff, who had ducked through the lowered train-crossing bars
and was trying to get across the tracks to the other side before he was
blocked by the train. The plaintiff was severely injured. The plaintiff
sued the defendant for his damages. During trial, the defendant proved
that it was not negligent in any way. The jurisdiction followed
comparative negligence principles. The court should rule in favor of

974

(A) the plaintiff, under the doctrine of strict liability.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff assumed the risk of getting hit

by the train.

(C) the defendant, because it was not negligent.

(D) the defendant, because the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by

trying to cross the tracks.

146. The seller knew that his car's engine was cracked. Because he wanted

to sell the car, he filled the crack with putty and painted it so that the
crack would not show. He then sold the car to a used car dealer. The
next day, the used car dealer was showing the car to a customer when
the crack caused the engine to explode, injuring the customer.

If the customer asserts a claim against the seller for injuries that he
sustained when the engine exploded, which of the following would be
the customer's most effective theory?

(A) Battery, because the seller knew that the engine was cracked.

(B) Intentional misrepresentation, because the seller knew that the

engine was cracked.

(C) Negligent misrepresentation, because the seller had a duty to

disclose that the engine was cracked.

(D) Negligence, because the seller should have anticipated that a

customer of the used car dealer would be injured as a result of the
cracked engine.

147. The defendant negligently burned down a restaurant when he used a

highly flammable cleaner to clean the restaurant's deep fryer. The
defendant was an independent contractor hired to clean the restaurant
and he owned no interest in the restaurant. The plaintiff, a waiter at the
restaurant, was laid off because of the fire damage and could not get a
job for six months. The plaintiff sued the defendant for his financial
losses from his joblessness. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the defendant, because the plaintiff suffered only economic harm.

(B) the defendant, because he owned no interest in the restaurant.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant's negligence caused him to be

laid off.

975

(D) the plaintiff, because the defendant's negligence burned down the

restaurant.

148. A natural gas factory was located on the edge of the city. When the

wind blew from the east, foul-smelling waste gases from the factory's
chimneys were blown over the city, causing most of the residents to
experience a burning of the eyes and throat. On several occasions, a
city resident attempted to persuade the city attorney to seek an
injunction against the factory. The city attorney refused, however,
because the city council was afraid that doing so would drive the
factory from the area. If the resident seeks an injunction by asserting a
claim against the factory on a theory of public nuisance, which of the
following would be the factory's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The city attorney's decision is binding.

(B) The resident has not sustained harm different from that of the

general public.

(C) A private citizen may not seek an injunction against environmental

polluters.

(D) A private citizen may not sue on a theory of public nuisance.

149. A trucker was eating cherry pie in a restaurant when a cherry pit

contained in the pie stuck in his throat. Unable to breathe, the trucker
began choking. A doctor who was eating in the restaurant ran to the
trucker's aid and performed an operation known as an emergency
tracheotomy. Then, at the doctor's direction, the trucker walked across
the street to a hospital. The hospital's emergency room had famously
long waits. Because hospital employees negligently failed to enter the
trucker's name in the emergency room register, he sat in the emergency
room for six hours without further attention. At that time, an earthquake
caused a portion of the hospital's structure to fall, striking the trucker
in the head and fracturing his skull. An earthquake had never occurred
in the state before.

Assume that the doctor's conduct in performing the emergency
tracheotomy was unreasonable, and if the doctor had acted reasonably,
the trucker would have coughed up the pit without any injury. In an
action by the trucker against the doctor for damages resulting from his
fractured skull, will the trucker win?

(A) Yes, since he would not have been in the hospital if the doctor had

976

not performed the tracheotomy.

(B) Yes, because it was foreseeable that the trucker would be required

to wait six hours in the hospital's emergency room.

(C) No, since he would not have been injured were it not for the cherry

pit contained in the pie.

(D) No, because the earthquake was a superseding cause of the

trucker's injury.

150. In answer to specific questions posed by the court, the jury found that
an accident was 60 percent the fault of the plaintiff and 40 percent the
fault of the defendant. In addition, the jury found that damage to
plaintiff's car amounted to $1,000, and that damage to the defendant's
car amounted to $10,000.

The jurisdiction had a statute that provided that “In any negligence
action, a plaintiff's recovery shall not be barred by that plaintiff's fault,
but the recovery of said plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to
such plaintiff's fault, unless that plaintiff's fault shall be greater than
that of the defendant, and in such event the plaintiff's recovery shall be
barred.” Which of the following correctly states the sum to which the
plaintiff is entitled?

(A) $600 ($1,000 less 40 percent).

(B) $400 ($1,000 less 60 percent).

(C) $1,000.

(D) 0.

151. The landlord was the owner of a four-story office building. An

attorney in the landlord's building knew that the elevator was broken,
but decided to take one of his client's up in it anyway. The landlord
had promised the attorney he would fix it, but the landlord did not do
so. When the attorney and the client were riding in the elevator, it
suddenly dropped, injuring the client.

The client asserted a claim against the landlord for damages resulting
from his injuries, alleging that the landlord was negligent in failing to
fix the elevator or warn the client about it. Which of the following
would be the landlord's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The landlord did not owe the client a duty to repair the elevator

977

since the landlord's promise was not made to the client.

(B) The client was a mere licensee since his presence did not confer a

benefit on the landlord.

(C) It was not foreseeable that the attorney would permit the client to
use the elevator since the attorney knew it was not working
properly.

(D) It was unreasonable for the attorney to permit the client to use the
elevator since the attorney knew that it was not working properly.

152. A licensed exterminator bought a large container of insecticide. The
label said it should only be used by professional exterminators. The
exterminator placed the container on a shelf in his shop, where it was
discovered by a janitor. Since the janitor thought there were termites in
his house, he opened the container and poured some of the chemical
pellets into a plastic bag that he then brought home. The next day, the
janitor's three-year-old daughter found the plastic bag containing the
pellets and ate some of them, becoming seriously ill as a result. A
statute in the jurisdiction adopted the all-or-nothing rule of
contributory negligence.

In an action by the daughter against the exterminator, which of the
following would be the daughter's most effective argument?

(A) The exterminator should have foreseen that the insecticide would
cause injury to someone in the daughter's position if left on an
exposed shelf in his shop.

(B) The insecticide was defective since its label did not adequately

warn of the dangers connected with its use.

(C) The insecticide is an inherently dangerous product.

(D) The janitor's theft of the pellets was a concurring cause of his

daughter's harm.

153. After living together for several months, a man and his girlfriend began
to argue frequently. On Monday, after an argument, the man left their
apartment in anger, saying that he didn't know when he was coming
back. The following Saturday, the girlfriend took all the man's
possessions, including his television set, to a swap meet in hopes of
selling them. At the swap meet, she sold the television to a neighbor.

978

If the man instituted an action against his former girlfriend for trespass
to chattel, which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if
it was the only one true, would be most helpful to the girlfriend's
defense?

(A) The man's leaving the apartment constituted implied consent to the

girlfriend's sale of his possessions.

(B) The girlfriend's interference with the man's right to the television

was serious enough to justify a forced sale.

(C) The neighbor committed a conversion by purchasing the television

set at the swap meet.

(D) At the time the man's action against her was instituted, the girlfriend

could not reacquire possession of the television set from the
neighbor.

154. The plaintiff and the defendant lived on the same street and worked in
the same office, so they formed a car pool, each driving his own car on
alternate days. One day while the defendant was driving, the car in
front of him stopped suddenly and without warning. Since the
defendant had taken his eyes off the road for a moment to look at the
plaintiff, he was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of the
stopped car. The plaintiff was injured as a result of the collision.

There was no automobile guest statute in the jurisdiction. In an action
by the plaintiff against the defendant, which of the following would be
the defendant's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff assumed the risk since he knew that it was possible
that the defendant's car would be involved in an accident while
traveling to work.

(B) The defendant's conduct was not a cause-in-fact of harm since the
accident would not have occurred if the car in front of him had not
stopped suddenly.

(C) The defendant did not owe the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care

since the plaintiff was a licensee.

(D) It was not negligent for the defendant to take his eyes off the road

for a moment.

155. After an accident, a woman was trapped in her car. The fire chief told
a volunteer firefighter to use a new device to free her. He knew the

979

device could be dangerous, and that the volunteer firefighter had not
been trained in how to use it. The volunteer firefighter used the device
improperly, injuring the woman.

If the woman instituted an action against the fire chief, the woman's
best theory would be

(A) negligence.

(B) battery.

(C) strict products liability.

(D) res ipsa loquitur.

156. As a result of her neighbor's negligence, the plaintiff's shoulder and
eye were both injured. The plaintiff went immediately to her eye
doctor. The eye doctor treated the injury to the plaintiff's eye but
suggested that she see an orthopedist for treatment of her shoulder. The
following day, the plaintiff visited an orthopedist, who treated the
plaintiff's shoulder.

Because of negligent treatment by the eye doctor, the plaintiff's nose
became infected, and because of negligent treatment by the
orthopedist, she lost the use of her elbow.

In an action by the plaintiff against her neighbor, which of the
following parts of the plaintiff's body is a court most likely to find
were injured as a proximate result of the neighbor's negligence?

(A) Her nose.

(B) Her elbow.

(C) Both her nose and elbow.

(D) Neither her nose nor her elbow.

157. A newspaper incorrectly stated that a local minister was a minister for

a group that was historically perceived as a cult engaged in unlawful
activities. Which of the following is a court most likely to find about
the statement?

(A) The statement is not defamatory if the group can be classified as a

religion under the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution.

980

(B) The statement is not defamatory if members of the group do not

currently engage in improper activities.

(C) The statement is not defamatory if a substantial group of right-

thinking people know that members of the group no longer engage
in improper activities.

(D) The statement is defamatory if many people continue to believe that

members of the group engage in improper activities.

158. A company was in the business of developing and manufacturing

machinery used in other industries.

A warehouse employee was injured when a pin in one of the
company's machines wore out. The company knew that a pin failure
was dangerous. The employee instituted a negligence action against
the company that made the machine. The company's defense was based
on the assertion that prior to the accident, the company neither knew
nor reasonably could have known that the pin would wear out. If the
jury believes this assertion, the employee will

(A) win, since the company is deemed to be an expert in its field and

has a duty to know all relevant facts about the product that it makes.

(B) win, since it is foreseeable that if the pin did wear out, someone

would be hurt.

(C) win, since a manufacturer is strictly liable for defects in its

product, whether or not it could have prevented those defects.

(D) lose.

159. A carpenter was working on the framework of his roof when he found
that he had brought the wrong hammer onto the roof with him. Without
looking to see if anyone was around, he tossed the hammer to the
ground, shouting, “Heads up!”

A man who was crossing the property was killed when the hammer hit
him in the head.

The representative of the man's estate instituted an appropriate action
against the carpenter, in a jurisdiction that applies the all-or-nothing
rule of contributory negligence, alleging that the carpenter's throwing
of the hammer without looking was negligence. If it were the only one
true, which of the following additional facts or inferences would be

981

most effective in the carpenter's defense against that allegation?

(A) It was reasonable for the carpenter to believe that no one would be

struck by the hammer.

(B) It is customary in the construction industry for people working on a
roof to toss unwanted tools and objects to the ground without
looking, so long as they shout, “Heads up!”

(C) The man could have avoided being struck by the hammer if he had

seen it coming.

(D) The blow of his hammer would not have caused a serious injury to
a normal person, but it seriously injured the man because his head
was extraordinarily sensitive.

160. A man bought a sealed pie from a grocery store. The pie was made by
a local manufacturer. After opening and eating half of the pie, the man
discovered that it was full of worms. A reasonable inspection by the
grocery store would have discovered the worms.

If the man asserts a claim for negligence against the grocery store, the
court should find for

(A) the man, because any negligence by the manufacturer of a product is

imputed to a retailer selling that product.

(B) the man, because the product was defective when the man

purchased it from the grocery store.

(C) the man, because the grocery store failed to act reasonably in

selling the product to the man.

(D) the grocery store, because a retailer is under no duty of reasonable

care when selling products packaged in sealed containers.

161. A mother negligently allowed her nine-year-old son to ride his bike on
a busy road. While doing so, the boy negligently swerved side-to-side
until he was hit by a car driven by a driver. The driver was acting
unreasonably when he struck the boy. The jurisdiction applies the all-
or-nothing rule of contributory negligence.

If the boy asserts a negligence claim against the driver for his injuries,
the court should find for

(A) the boy, because a nine-year-old is presumed incapable of

982

contributory negligence.

(B) the boy, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.

(C) the driver, because the accident resulted from the boy's

unreasonable conduct.

(D) the driver, because it was unreasonable for the boy's mother to give

her son permission to ride his bicycle along the roadway.

162. While attempting to make an arrest at a grocery store, police officers

knocked over several stacks of merchandise, including cases of bottled
soda-pop. This caused minute cracks in all the bottles. The following
day, store employees cleaned up the mess, restacking the cases of
soda-pop without checking any of the bottles for damage. A woman
purchased one of the bottles but did not notice the minute crack in it.

That evening, the woman was placing the bottle on the dinner table
when the bottle exploded because of the crack in it, sending fragments
of glass flying in all directions. The woman was injured.

In an action by the woman against the grocery store, a court is most
likely to find for

(A) the woman, because she could not have done anything to protect

herself against the kind of injury that occurred.

(B) the woman, because the grocery store's conduct in restacking and

selling the bottles without some sort of inspection was
unreasonable under the circumstances.

(C) the grocery store, because the conduct of the police officers was a

proximate cause of the injury sustained by the woman.

(D) the grocery store, because the woman and the grocery store were

not in privity.

163. While standing in an art gallery, a buyer overheard a conversation
between a collector and an art dealer. The dealer stated that a
particular painting was worth $250,000. After the collector left the
gallery, the buyer purchased the painting for $225,000 from the dealer.
The buyer subsequently learned that the painting was worth only $600.

If the buyer is successful in a tort action for misrepresentation against
the dealer, the court is likely to award him a judgment for

983

(A) $250,000 (the value that the dealer stated).

(B) $250,000 (the value that the dealer stated), on condition that the

buyer return the painting to the dealer.

(C) $225,000 (the price that the buyer paid to the dealer).

(D) $224,400 (the price that the buyer paid to the dealer, less the value

of the painting).

164. A man lent his friend his car. The man knew his friend had had his

license revoked for reckless driving, but his friend promised he was
only driving his mother to a doctor's appointment and would return the
car as quickly as possible. In fact, the friend drove the car several
hundred miles away to visit his girlfriend. On the way back, the friend
was speeding and swerving between cars when he crashed into a
woman's car. Because the man's friend had no money, the woman sued
the man for negligence. May she recover?

(A) Yes, because the man loaned his friend the car.

(B) Yes, because the man owned the car.

(C) No, because the friend lied to the man about how he would use the

car.

(D) No, because the woman is only suing the man because his friend

has no money.

165. The plaintiff purchased a bottle of dishwashing detergent made by the

defendant at a supermarket. After using the product for washing dishes,
the plaintiff experienced a serious rash on his hands and wrists as the
result of an allergic reaction to a chemical in the product.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant on the ground that
the product was not merchantable, which of the following additional
facts or inferences, if it were the only one true, would provide the
defendant with its most effective defense?

(A) The plaintiff's allergic reaction was the only such reaction that ever

occurred.

(B) The supermarket purchased the product from an independent

wholesaler that purchased it from the defendant.

(C) Before marketing the product, the defendant made a reasonable

effort to determine whether the product would be harmful to normal

984

skin.

(D) Prior to manufacturing and marketing the product, the defendant
received approval for its sale from the federal Food and Drug
Administration.

166. A statute required all high-rise construction sites to be surrounded by a
temporary fence. The purpose of the statute was to protect people from
being hurt by falling construction debris. A construction company
failed to fence in one of its sites near an elementary school. One of the
schoolchildren wandered onto the site and was poisoned when he
drank water from a puddle on the site. The child's injury was severe.
The child sued the construction company, and the court found the child
would not have been able to get onto the site if the proper fence had
been in place. It also found that a reasonable child of the child's age,
intelligence, and experience would not have drunk the water from the
puddle. The child's attorney then asked the judge to instruct the jury
that the violation of the statute was negligence per se. Should the court
do so?

(A) Yes, because the child would not have been hurt but for the

violation of the statute.

(B) Yes, because the puddle was under the construction company's

control.

(C) No, because the child was poisoned.

(D) No, because the child failed to adhere to the proper standard of

care.

167. The plaintiff and the defendant were at an extremely loud rock concert.
During an argument about gun control, the defendant called the plaintiff
a “dope smoking moron” who only supported gun rights because he
was a “habitual thief.” The plaintiff had never done drugs or stolen
from anyone. A fellow concertgoer overheard the remark and
understood it, although it was so loud that the defendant had no reason
to believe anyone else at the concert could hear him arguing with the
plaintiff. The plaintiff sued the defendant for defamation. During trial,
the court found that the defendant was not negligent in his making of the
statement. The court should find the defendant

(A) liable for libel.

(B) liable for slander.

985

(C) liable for defamation.

(D) not liable.

168. The plaintiff was injured in a car accident and received $100,000
worth of damages. The jury further found that the plaintiff's damage
was caused 20 percent by the plaintiff's negligence, 40 percent by one
defendant's negligence, and 40 percent by another defendant's
negligence. The jurisdiction had a statute that read as follows:

In  a  negligence  action,  no  plaintiff  shall  be  barred  from  recovery
because  of  that  plaintiff's  contributory  negligence,  but  such  plaintiff's
recovery shall be diminished in proportion to plaintiff's own fault.

The court held that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for
the plaintiff's damage and entered judgment for the plaintiff consistent
with the jury's verdict.

Prior to the entry of judgment, the plaintiff collected $10,000 from an
insurance company under a policy in which it agreed to pay any
medical bills that the plaintiff might incur as the result of an
automobile accident. Which of the following correctly reflects the sum
that the plaintiff is entitled to collect from the defendants?

(A) $90,000, because the plaintiff's damage of $100,000 should be
diminished by the sum the plaintiff received from the insurance
company.

(B) $80,000, because the plaintiff's damage of $100,000 should be

diminished by a sum proportional to the plaintiff's own fault,
without regard to sums that the plaintiff has received under the
insurance policy.

(C) $70,000, because the plaintiff's damage of $100,000 should be

diminished by a sum proportional to the plaintiff's own fault and
further diminished by the sum that the plaintiff received under the
insurance policy.

(D) $60,000, because the plaintiff's damage of $100,000 should be

diminished by a sum proportional to the plaintiff's own fault, and
the two defendants' proportional shares should each be further
diminished by the sum that the plaintiff received under the
insurance policy.

169. Although a man realized that his neighbor was drunk, the man asked the

986

neighbor for a ride home. The neighbor agreed and left with the man at
once. Because he was drunk, the neighbor lost control of his car.

The man asserts a negligence claim for his injuries against his
neighbor in a jurisdiction that applies the all-or-nothing rule of
contributory negligence. Which of the following arguments would be
likely to provide the neighbor with an effective defense to that claim?

(A) The man was contributorily negligent in accepting a ride from his

neighbor when he knew his neighbor was drunk.

(B) The man assumed the risk by accepting a ride from his neighbor

when he knew his neighbor was drunk.

(C) It did not matter that the man knew his neighbor was drunk.

(D) The man was contributorily negligent and assumed the risk by
accepting the ride when he knew his neighbor was drunk.

170. A monthly publication of interest primarily to persons who deal in the

purchase and sale of historic buildings as an investment stated that a
property had been purchased by the plaintiff for $1,450,000. It
described the plaintiff as a bank president earning a salary of
$200,000 per year and stated that she had purchased the property with
part of the $1 million fortune that she inherited from her mother.

The plaintiff asserted a claim for invasion of privacy on the ground
that the publication appropriated her identity by publishing the article
about her without her permission. Which of the following would be the
publication's most effective argument in defense?

(A) Information about the purchaser of the property was of interest to

readers of the publication.

(B) The article about the plaintiff did not enrich the publication because

the plaintiff was not a celebrity.

(C) The sale of the property to the plaintiff was a matter of public

record.

(D) Publication of the article was not the result of actual malice.

171. For many years, powdered cement used by a factory was delivered in
90-pound sacks. Recently, however, factory officials determined that it
would be considerably less expensive to purchase unbagged cement.

987

A landowner lived in the area. After the factory began using unbagged
cement, cement dust from the factory's operation continually settled on
the cabin that the landowner occupied. Although the dust did no
physical harm to the cabin or to the landowner, the landowner
complained to officials of the factory that the dust annoyed her.
Because the factory received no other complaints from area residents,
however, it continued using unbagged cement.

The landowner asserts a negligence claim against the factory. Which
of the following would be the factory's most effective argument in
defense?

(A) Changing from bagged cement to unbagged cement resulted in

substantial financial savings to the factory.

(B) The factory's conduct was not a factual cause of the landowner's

discomfort because no other residents complained about the dust.

(C) The landowner assumed the risk by continuing to live in the area.

(D) The landowner sustained no damage as a result of the factory's

conduct.

172. In a negligence action by the plaintiff, the court found that the

defendants were jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in the sum
of $100,000. The court also found that in producing the plaintiff's
injury, the first defendant was 40 percent at fault and the second
defendant was 60 percent at fault. The jurisdiction has a statute
recognizing the right of contribution between joint tortfeasors, and that
contribution shall be based on apportionment of fault.

After the entry of judgment, the plaintiff succeeded in collecting
$100,000 from the first defendant. In an action for contribution by the
first defendant against the second defendant, which of the following
correctly states the amount that he is entitled to collect from the second
defendant?

(A) 0.

(B) $40,000 (40 percent of $100,000).

(C) $50,000 (50 percent of $100,000).

(D) $60,000 (60 percent of $100,000).

173. An employee was driving a pickup truck owned by the company when

988

he collided with an automobile owned and operated by a driver. The
plaintiff, a passenger in the car, sued. At trial, the jury fixed the amount
of the plaintiff's damages and found that the employee was 40 percent
at fault, the driver was 60 percent at fault, and the plaintiff was not at
fault. It was also found that the employee was acting within the scope
of his duties as an employee of the company when the accident
occurred. In issuing a judgment for the passenger, the court held that
the employee and the driver were jointly and severally liable for the
passenger's injuries and that the company was vicariously liable for
the employee's tort. The jurisdiction had statutes that adopted pure
comparative negligence and recognized a right of contribution between
joint tortfeasors.

In enforcing the judgment, the plaintiff succeeded in collecting
$100,000 from the company. If the company asserts a claim against the
employee seeking compensation for the company's payment to the
plaintiff, the company is entitled to recover

(A) nothing, because the company was found to be vicariously liable

for the employee's tort.

(B) $40,000 as partial indemnity.

(C) $50,000 as contribution.

(D) $100,000 as complete indemnity.

174. A biker was riding her bicycle in a reasonable manner when she was

struck by a car negligently driven by a driver. As a result, the biker
was thrown to the ground, breaking her left leg. A moment later, while
lying in the road, the biker was struck by a car negligently driven by a
second driver, breaking the biker's right leg.

If the biker asserts a claim against the second driver, the second driver
will be held liable for damages resulting from

(A) the biker's broken right leg.

(B) the biker's broken right and left legs.

(C) the biker's broken right and left legs, but only if the first driver's

conduct was foreseeable.

(D) neither leg.

175. As a result of a minor earthquake, the framework of a building that the

989

builder was erecting collapsed. When the builder began the building,
he knew that the steel that he was using for that purpose was of poor
quality but decided to use it anyway. If the steel had not been of poor
quality, the earthquake would not have caused the building to collapse.

A driver was employed by a gas company to operate a gasoline truck.
She had parked the truck in front of the builder's construction site
moments before the earthquake. When the building collapsed, falling
debris struck the truck, causing it to rupture and causing its cargo of
gasoline to leak. A stream of gasoline that leaked from the truck
flowed for three blocks until it reached another nearby street. There,
unaware of the presence of gasoline, a man tossed a lit cigarette into
the street. The cigarette caused the gasoline to explode, injuring a
woman standing nearby.

If the woman asserts a claim against the gas company driver, alleging
that it was negligent for the driver to park a gasoline truck in front of a
construction site, which of the following would be the driver's most
effective argument in defense against the woman's claim?

(A) The builder's use of poor-quality steel was a superseding cause of

the woman's injury.

(B) The explosion would not have occurred if the man did not throw a

lit cigarette into the street.

(C) The driver could not have anticipated that falling debris from the
construction site would cause the truck to rupture and leak.

(D) The explosion that injured the woman was proximately caused by

the earthquake.

176. The owner of a supermarket purchased an automatic door-opener from

its manufacturer. The device included rubber step-plates that were to
be installed on the floor on both sides of the door.

The store owner hired a contractor to install the automatic door-
opener while the store was closed for the night. The contractor read
the instructions furnished by the manufacturer but disregarded a
warning regarding testing the step-plates. When he finished installing
the device, he did not test it by stepping on one of the step-plates, but
advised the store's night manager that the job was complete. The
following morning, a customer was injured by the door.

990

The customer asserted a claim against the manufacturer on the ground
that the step-plate was defective when sold by the manufacturer.
Which of the following would be the manufacturer's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) It was not foreseeable that a person installing the automatic door-
opener would disregard the warning contained in the instructions.

(B) The manufacturer did not act unreasonably in designing or

manufacturing the automatic door opener or in furnishing the
instructions that came with them.

(C) The customer was not a purchaser of the automatic door-opener.

(D) The store owner was negligent in selecting the contractor to install

the automatic door-opener.

177. The plaintiff owned a local coffee shop. The defendant wrote a

newspaper story that the plaintiff had been accused by a customer of
drugging her coffee and locking her in a dungeon in the basement. The
customer really made the accusation, but the accusation was false and
the customer was well-known throughout town for making false
accusations against shop owners she didn't like. The plaintiff sued the
defendant for defamation. At trial, it was established the plaintiff was
not a public figure, and the plaintiff presented evidence that the
defendant knew or should have known of the customer's habit of
making false accusations. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the defendant, because the plaintiff did not establish that the

defendant believed the accusations were false.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff did not establish that the

defendant recklessly disregarded whether the accusations were
true.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff did not establish that the

defendant intended to cause harm to the plaintiff's reputation.

(D) the plaintiff.

178. A homeowner hired a painter to paint the outside of the homeowner's

house.

Two days later, a government employee was walking across the
homeowner's lawn while delivering mail. The homeowner saw the
employee walking toward the painter's ladder on his lawn but did not

991

warn the employee because he believed that she saw it. Although the
lawn had recently been mowed and the ladder was in plain view, the
employee did not see the ladder and tripped over it, injuring her knee.

The jurisdiction applies the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence.

If the government employee asserts a negligence claim against the
painter for damages resulting from her injury, which of the following
would be the painter's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The ladder was in plain view.

(B) The employee was trespassing at the time the accident occurred.

(C) The painter owed no duty to licensees of the homeowner.

(D) The homeowner was negligent in not warning the employee about

the ladder.

179. The plaintiff was involved in an accident after he was hit by a drunk

driver. The amount of alcohol that one defendant sold the driver would
have made her intoxicated even if a second defendant sold the driver
no alcohol at all, and the amount of alcohol that the second defendant
sold the driver would have made the driver intoxicated even if the first
defendant sold the driver no alcohol at all. Which of the following
statements is most correct?

(A) The first defendant did not cause the plaintiff's injury because the
second defendant subsequently sold the driver enough alcohol to
make her intoxicated.

(B) The second defendant did not cause the plaintiff's injury because

the first defendant had previously sold the driver enough alcohol to
make her intoxicated.

(C) Neither defendant caused the injury.

(D) Both defendants caused the injury.

180. A landowner hired a professional architect to draw plans for a two-

story residence to be constructed on the landowner's realty. The plans
that the architect prepared called for a staircase to be supported by a
single concrete pillar. The landowner then hired a licensed building
contractor to construct a house in accordance with the architect's
design. Upon examining the plans, the contractor told the landowner

992

that she did not think that one pillar would provide sufficient support
for the staircase. When the landowner discussed the contractor's
objection with the architect, however, the architect insisted that one
pillar would be sufficient. The landowner told this to the contractor
and convinced the contractor to rely on the architect's plan.

The contractor completed the building as agreed and turned it over to
the landowner on April 1. Two weeks later, the landowner hired a
mover to move a piano onto the second floor of the house. While the
mover was carrying the piano up the staircase, the staircase collapsed,
causing the mover to sustain injury. If the staircase had been supported
by two columns, it would not have collapsed.

If the mover asserts a negligence claim against the architect, which of
the following would be the architect's most effective argument in
defense?

(A) It was reasonable to support the staircase with only one pillar.

(B) The architect owed the mover no duty since the architect was

employed by the landowner.

(C) The contractor had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.

(D) The use of a single pillar to support the staircase was a matter
exclusively within the architect's professional judgment as an
architect.

181. A man was obviously intoxicated when he entered a bartender's tavern
one night and ordered a drink. A statute made it unlawful to serve
liquor to any intoxicated person. Even so, the bartender served the
man. After drinking the liquor, the man left the tavern and began
driving home.

Before the liquor left the manufacturer's factory, an angry employee
added a poison to it that could not have been discovered by
reasonable inspection. While the man was driving in a reasonable
manner, the poison caused him to die. As a result, the man's car struck
a pedestrian, injuring her.

If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the bartender based on the
bartender's violation of the above statute, which of the following
would be the bartender's most effective argument in defense against

993

that claim?

(A) The bartender did not serve the man enough liquor to make him

intoxicated.

(B) The statute was not meant to prevent people from drinking liquor

that had been poisoned.

(C) Serving the liquor to the man was not a cause of the pedestrian's

injuries.

(D) The angry employee's conduct was a superseding cause of the

pedestrian's injuries.

182. An airline went out of business and sold a belt truck to a second
airline. An independent contractor hired by the second airline to
maintain the second airline's equipment set the truck's belt idle above
25. Due to a mistake at the factory, the belt truck was not equipped
with an acceleration suppressor. An acceleration suppressor would
keep the truck from lurching no matter where the idle was set.
Subsequently, an employee of the second airline attempted to activate
the belt while standing beside the belt truck. Because the idle was set
above 25, she was injured when the belt truck lurched forward and
struck her.

The employee asserted a negligence claim against the independent
contractor. Which one of the following additional facts or inferences,
if it were the only one true, would be most likely to result in a
judgment for the independent contractor in a jurisdiction that applies
the all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence?

(A) Belt trucks are usually equipped with acceleration suppressors.

(B) If the employee had been in the driver's seat when she started the

belt truck, she would not have been injured.

(C) The omission of an acceleration suppressor was a manufacturing

defect in the belt truck.

(D) The first airline failed to notify the second airline about the need

for an acceleration suppressor.

183. A company operated a manufacturing plant just outside the town.

Breezes frequently carried fumes from the company's plant into the
town.

994

A homeowner's son developed a respiratory illness as the result of an
unusual reaction to the fumes. The homeowner complained to the
company about his son's illness. When the company responded by
offering to buy the homeowner's house, the homeowner refused.

The homeowner asserted a public nuisance claim on behalf of his son
in which he sought an order directing the company to eliminate the
fumes. Which of the following would be the company's most effective
argument in response to this claim?

(A) The claim is not for special damages.

(B) The son's illness was the result of an unusually sensitive reaction to

the fumes.

(C) The homeowner assumed the risk by refusing to sell the property to

the company.

(D) The fumes did not violate state pollution laws.

184. The manufacturer made a product that was sold over the counter for the
treatment of dandruff and dry scalp conditions. A doctor purchased a
bottle at a drugstore. A statement on the label read, “This product will
not harm normal scalp or hair.” The doctor used the product as
directed. Because of a scalp condition making him allergic to one of
the ingredients, the product irritated his scalp, causing him much pain
and discomfort.

In an action by the doctor against the drugstore, which of the following
would be the doctor's most effective argument?

(A) Any negligence by the manufacturer is imputed to the drugstore.

(B) The product was defective as labeled.

(C) The drugstore breached an express warranty.

(D) A drugstore is under a special duty to be aware of possible allergic

reactions to products that it sells.

185. After the plaintiff sued the defendants for injuries caused in an auto

accident, the jury found that the accident was 60 percent the fault of the
first defendant and 40 percent the fault of the second defendant. The
court ruled that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for the
plaintiff's injuries, which amounted to $100,000.

995

The jurisdiction had a statute that provided that “In any negligence
action, a plaintiff's recovery shall not be barred by that plaintiff's fault,
but the recovery of said plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to
such plaintiff's fault unless that plaintiff's fault shall be greater than
that of the defendant, and in such event the plaintiff's recovery shall be
barred.” Which of the following correctly states the sum that the
plaintiff is entitled to receive from the second defendant?

(A) $60,000 (60 percent of $100,000).

(B) $40,000 (40 percent of $100,000).

(C) $100,000.

(D) 0.

186. A daily newspaper printed an article about a minister's speech. The

article referred to the minister's speech as “inspiring, considering the
fact the minister suffers from leprosy.” After seeing the article, the
minister sued the newspaper for defamation.

The newspaper moved to dismiss the minister's action on the grounds
that his complaint contained no allegation of damage. Which of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one true,
would be most helpful to the minister in opposing the motion to
dismiss?

(A) Leprosy is a loathsome disease.

(B) The minister was so upset upon 

reading the newspaper's statement about him that he became
physically ill.

(C) Editors of the newspaper disliked the minister.

(D) The minister is neither a public official nor a public figure.

187. A man was eating one of the company's pre-packaged desserts when he

found a cockroach in it.

In an action by the man against the company, which of the following
additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one true, would
provide the company with its most effective defense?

(A) The company did not act unreasonably in manufacturing, packaging,

or marketing the product purchased by the man.

996

(B) The man sustained no injury as a result of the presence of a

cockroach in the product.

(C) The company complied with all statutory requirements for quality

control in the production of the product.

(D) The man purchased the product on the recommendation of a sales

clerk at the grocery store.

188. A pilot was flying his airplane when one of its engines stopped

working. Although the pilot thought he could probably make it back to
the airport, he decided it would be safer to make an emergency landing
in a farmer's field. The plane ended up causing $500 worth of damage
to the farmer's crops, although the pilot's actual landing of the plane
was done in accordance with federal aviation rules and was not
negligent. The farmer sued the pilot to recover his $500. The court
should rule in favor of

(A) the pilot, because the broken engine created a private necessity.

(B) the pilot, because the pilot was not negligent.

(C) the farmer, because the pilot damaged his crops.

(D) the farmer, because the pilot probably could have made it back to

the airport.

189. Two political candidates were known for insulting and playing pranks
on each other. During a nationally televised debate, the defendant lit a
firecracker as a joke and tossed it onto the plaintiff's podium right as
the plaintiff was making a speech regarding his toughness and bravery
in foreign policy. When the firecracker went off, the plaintiff covered
his head and fell onto the floor. Although the plaintiff sustained no
physical injury, the audience laughed and he was embarrassed by the
incident.

The plaintiff filed a claim against the defendant for intentional
infliction of emotional distress. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the defendant, because the plaintiff was only embarrassed.

(B) the defendant, because he was only joking.

(C) the plaintiff, because he fell onto the floor.

(D) the plaintiff, because throwing a firecracker at someone is

outrageous.

997

190. A store owner hired a contractor to install an automatic door-opener
while the store was closed for the night. The contractor read the
instructions furnished by the manufacturer but disregarded a warning
related to its installation. The following morning, a customer was
injured by the door when it short-circuited. In a claim by the customer
against the contractor, which of the following would be the customer's
most effective argument?

(A) The contractor's liability is established by res ipsa loquitur.

(B) It was unreasonable for the contractor to disregard the warning
contained in the instructions furnished by the manufacturer.

(C) The automatic door-opener was installed in a way that made it unfit

for ordinary use.

(D) The short circuit made the automatic door-opener defective.

191. A driver was driving her automobile in the rain when she rounded a
bend and saw a cow standing directly in her path. She immediately
jammed on her brakes and pulled the steering wheel to the right in an
attempt to avoid striking the cow. As a result, she lost control of her
car, which skidded off the road and into the homeowner's yard.

In an action by the homeowner against the driver for negligence, which
of the following arguments would be most effective as a defense for
the driver?

(A) Her conduct did not result in damage.

(B) She was not required to act reasonably because she was confronted

by an emergency.

(C) She was privileged by the doctrine of necessity.

(D) It was foreseeable that users of the road would deviate onto

adjacent private land in connection with their use of the road.

192. A doctor owned a large machine for putting patients to sleep during
surgery. The doctor sent the machine to the manufacturer for repairs.
While making the repairs, the manufacturer accidentally filled the
anesthetic gas can with plain oxygen and the plain oxygen can with
anesthetic. During a surgery, the doctor wanted to administer pure
oxygen to the patient. However, because of the mistake in the cans, the
patient got pure anesthetic instead. As a result, the patient died.

998

The patient's family sued the doctor for damages resulting from the
death of the patient. During trial, the court found the doctor acted
unreasonably in her treatment of the patient. The court should find the
doctor is

(A) liable, because the doctor was unreasonable in her treatment of the

patient.

(B) liable, because of res ipsa loquitur.

(C) not liable, because the death was caused by the manufacturer's

negligence.

(D) not liable, because the negligence occurred while the machine was

in the care of the manufacturer.

ANSWERS TO 
TORTS QUESTIONS

1.  B  If  the  risk  of  injury  to  the  doctor  was  not  foreseeable,  then  the
manufacturer could not be said to have acted unreasonably in the face
of a foreseeable risk. Since negligence is usually defined as failure to
act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable risk, this would mean that
the manufacturer was not negligent.

Conduct  is  a  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm  would  not  have  occurred
without  it.  Thus,  if  the  label  contained  a  warning  that  the  doctor
disregarded  or  failed  to  read,  his  conduct  could  be  contributory  or
comparative negligence that helped cause his injury. Since the label
did  not  contain  any  warning,  however,  his  injury  would  have
occurred whether he read it or not. For this reason, his failure to read
it was not causally related to the harm that he suffered and does not
provide the manufacturer with a defense. If the doctor sued for breach
of  warranty,  he  might  be  required  to  show  that  he  relied  on  some
statement  contained  on  the  label,  and  his  failure  to  read  it  might
prevent  him  from  establishing  such  reliance.  Since  his  lawsuit  is
based  on  negligence,  however,  A  is  incorrect.  Even  if  the  product
was manufactured by another, the manufacturer would be under a duty
to  use  reasonable  care  in  marketing  it,  so  that  fact  alone  would  not
protect the manufacturer against liability to the doctor. C is therefore
incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  manufacturer's  lack  of
awareness might have been negligent if the reasonable person in the
manufacturer's shoes would have been aware.

2. A Negligence is unreasonable conduct in the face of a foreseeable risk.
The  defendant's  awareness  of  the  high  incidence  of  crime  in  the
neighborhood  would  make  the  risk  foreseeable  and  might  result  in  a
finding  that  it  was  unreasonable  for  her  to  open  the  door  under  the
circumstances. While it is not certain that a court would come to this
conclusion, the fact in A is the only one listed that would help support
the plaintiff's case.

The  plaintiff's  knowledge  would  not  impose  any  duty  on  the
defendant, so B is incorrect. Although the defendant's intention to sell
furniture  to  the  plaintiff  might  make  the  plaintiff  an  invitee,  and
thereby impose upon the defendant a duty to act reasonably, the duty
would not be breached unless the defendant had some reason to know

1001

that there was a danger in opening the door. C is therefore incorrect.
D  is  incorrect  because  unless  the  defendant  knew  or  should  have
known  of  the  incident,  it  would  have  no  relevance  to  the
reasonableness of the defendant's conduct.

3. D A misrepresentation is a false assertion of material fact made with the
intent  to  induce  the  plaintiff's  reliance.  If  the  defendant  knew  that  the
statement  was  false,  and  if  the  plaintiff  justifiably  relied  upon  it,  the
defendant is liable for damage that results. If a party to a transaction is
under  a  legal  obligation  to  disclose  a  fact,  nondisclosure  may  be  an
assertion that the fact does not exist. Thus, since the developer had an
obligation to disclose that the highway was coming, her silence was an
assertion  that  there  was  no  highway  coming.  Since  she  knew  this
assertion to be false, she is liable for misrepresentation if the farmer's
reliance on it was justified. Consequently, D is correct.

Since  real  estate  investors  are  usually  experts  in  determining  the
value of real estate, the fact that the farmer knew the developer to be
a  real  estate  investor  might  have  justified  his  reliance  on  her
misrepresentation.  A  is  incorrect  because  this  would  be  likely  to
result  in  a  victory  for  the  farmer  rather  than  the  developer.  If  the
developer's  nondisclosure  was  a  misrepresentation,  she  probably
repeated  the  misrepresentation  by  permitting  an  appraiser  to
determine  value  without  disclosing  the  coming  of  the  highway.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  A  fiduciary  relationship  is  one  based  on  trust.
Since  buyer  and  seller  are  adversaries,  neither  is  the  other's
fiduciary. C is therefore incorrect.

4. D Negligence is the failure to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable
risk. If selling a pistol for less than $50 created a foreseeable risk to
the woman, it might be found that the gun maker's conduct in doing so
was  unreasonable  and  that  the  gun  maker  is  liable  to  the  woman  for
negligence.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this
conclusion, the argument in D is the only one listed that could possibly
support the woman's claim.

Intent is an essential element of battery. In a battery case, intent means
that  the  defendant  desired  (or  knew  with  substantial  certainty)  that
harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  the  plaintiff  would  occur.  A  is
incorrect  because  the  fact  that  harm  is  foreseeable  (rather  than
substantially certain) is not sufficient to result in liability for battery.
In  every  sale  by  a  merchant,  there  is  an  implied  warranty  that  the

1002

product  sold  is  merchantable,  or  fit  for  ordinary  use.  There  is  no
indication,  however,  that  the  pistol  did  not  function  as  a  pistol
ordinarily functions. B is therefore incorrect. It is sometimes said that
violation of a criminal statute establishes negligence if the statute was
designed to protect a class of persons to which the plaintiff belongs
against  risks  like  the  one  that  led  to  the  harm.  C  is  incorrect,
however, because there is no indication that the gun maker violated a
criminal statute.

5. C One whose conduct creates a foreseeable risk to any person owes that
person a duty of reasonable care. One who helps an intoxicated person
get his or her car started is creating a foreseeable risk to all who are
likely  to  be  endangered  by  that  person's  driving.  If  the  injury  to  the
pedestrian occurred 200 miles away from the place where the dentist
assisted  the  man,  however,  it  may  successfully  be  argued  that  the
reasonable  person  in  the  man's  situation  would  not  have  anticipated
harm to him because the man could be expected to sober up in the time
it took to drive that distance. While it is not certain that a court would
come to this conclusion, the argument in C is the only one listed that
could possibly support the dentist's defense.

Although a statute like the one mentioned in A might impose liability
on  the  bartender,  it  would  not  have  the  effect  of  relieving  any  other
person of liability, so A is incorrect. B is incorrect because being in
the road service business does not exempt any person from his or her
common law duty to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable risk.
D  would  establish  that  the  man's  intoxication  was  a  cause  of  the
accident but would not establish that the dentist's actions were not. If
anything,  it  would  prove  the  cause-and-effect  relationship  between
the dentist's conduct and the accident. D is therefore incorrect.

6. C  Negligence  liability  requires  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care
that  is  a  proximate  cause  of  the  plaintiff's  damage.  To  say  that  the
plaintiff was outside the foreseeable zone of danger is simply another
way  of  saying  that  because  of  where  the  plaintiff  was  located,  the
injury  to  him  or  her  was  not  foreseeable.  This  argument  could  help
support the driver's defense in two ways. First, if harm to the painter
was not foreseeable, the driver did not owe him a duty of reasonable
care.  This  would  mean  that,  although  the  driver's  conduct  might  have
been negligent as to the hunter, it could not have been negligent as to
the  painter.  Second,  unless  some  injury  to  the  painter  was  a

1003

foreseeable  result  of  the  driver's  conduct,  that  conduct  was  not  a
proximate cause of it. Although a court might not agree that the painter
was  outside  the  foreseeable  zone  of  danger,  the  argument  in  C  is  the
only one listed that could possibly support the driver's defense.

It  is  generally  understood  that  if  an  injury  to  the  plaintiff  was
foreseeable, all its complications are foreseeable too, no matter how
improbable those complications actually were. For this reason, A and
D  are  incorrect.  Joint  tortfeasors  are  two  or  more  persons  whose
torts  proximately  caused  the  same  injury.  In  most  jurisdictions,  they
are  jointly  and  severally  liable  for  the  full  extent  of  the  plaintiff's
injury.  The  argument  in  B  would  establish  that  the  hunter  was
negligent, but this would not provide the driver with a defense since
he and the hunter might be found to be joint tortfeasors.

7. A All persons are liable for the harm that proximately results from their
negligence. Thus, if the burglar's injury was proximately caused by the
brewery's negligence, the brewery is liable to her.

An express warranty is an assertion of fact that becomes part of the
basis of the bargain. B is incorrect because there is no indication that
an  express  warranty  was  made.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  clean
hands  doctrine,  which  is  relevant  in  equity  proceedings,  is  not
applicable  to  an  action  for  money  damages.  Since  it  is  foreseeable
that  the  burglar  could  obtain  the  beer  in  some  manner,  the  precise
manner  in  which  the  burglar  obtained  the  beer  is  immaterial.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

8. C  False  imprisonment  occurs  when  the  defendant  intentionally  confines
the plaintiff. The plaintiff is confined when his or her will to leave a
place with fixed boundaries is overcome in a way that would similarly
overcome the will of the reasonable person in the plaintiff's situation.
Since  the  fisherman  was  not  prevented  from  leaving,  he  was  not
confined (i.e., imprisoned).

In  a  false  imprisonment  case,  the  term  intent  means  a  desire  or
knowledge that the defendant's act will result in a confinement of the
plaintiff and does not depend on whether the defendant knew that the
plaintiff's  rights  were  being  violated.  Thus,  if  the  acts  of  the  movie
studio's employees had resulted in a confinement of the fisherman, the
fact that they did not know they were violating the fisherman's rights
would  not  provide  them  with  an  effective  defense.  A  is  therefore

1004

incorrect. B is incorrect because false imprisonment is an intentional
tort of which unreasonable conduct is not an essential element. D is
incorrect because damage is not an essential element of liability for
false imprisonment.

9.  C  Although  liability  ordinarily  results  from  the  publication  of  false
defamatory  statements  about  the  plaintiff,  the  courts  have  always
required  that  publication  be  either  intentional  or  the  result  of
negligence.  The  competitor's  statement  to  the  handyman  was  not  a
publication  since  the  handyman  is  the  plaintiff.  The  fact  that  it  was
overheard  by  the  customer  does  not  satisfy  the  requirement  of
publication unless either the competitor intended that the customer hear
it or the customer heard it as a result of the competitor's unreasonable
conduct in the face of the foreseeable risk that the customer would hear
it. If the competitor knew that the customer would hear it, he intended
the publication. If he should have known that the customer would hear
it, he acted unreasonably in saying it.

When the plaintiff is not a public figure, courts do not require proof
that  the  defendant  knew  the  statement  to  be  defamatory,  so  A  is
incorrect.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  in  some
defamation cases, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant knew or
should have known that the statement was false when he made it. B is
incorrect, however, because the requirement has not been applied to a
defamation  action  brought  by  a  private  person  against  a  non-media
defendant. D is incorrect because knowledge that harm will result is
not an essential element of any defamation case.

10.  C  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective  condition  when  sold  and  that  reaches  the  consumer  in  a
condition  that  is  substantially  unchanged.  Although  the  farmer  could
still be held liable, C would be her most effective argument.

A  is  incorrect  because  intervening  negligence,  unless  it  was
unforeseeable, is not sufficient to relieve the supplier of a defective
product from liability. Although privity or some substitute is relevant
to warranty liability, strict liability in tort may be applied to benefit
any  plaintiff  whose  contact  with  the  product  was  foreseeable.  B  is
therefore incorrect. Since strict liability is not based on fault, proof
that  the  defect  resulted  from  some  circumstance  beyond  the
defendant's  control  is  not  sufficient  to  free  that  defendant  from
liability. D is therefore incorrect.

1005

11. C Assault results when the defendant, with the intention of causing either
offensive  contact  or  apprehension  of  offensive  contact,  induces
apprehension of such contact in the plaintiff. Battery results when the
defendant,  with  the  intention  of  causing  either  offensive  contact  or
apprehension  of  offensive  contact,  causes  offensive  contact  with  the
plaintiff. The defendant, intending to cause apprehension of offensive
contact,  induced  such  apprehension,  making  him  liable  for  assault.
With intent to induce apprehension, he also caused offensive contact,
making  him  liable  for  battery.  Therefore,  A,  B,  and  D  are  all
incorrect.

12. D A negligent misrepresentation is a false assertion of fact that is made
without  knowledge  of  its  falsity  but  under  circumstances  such  that  a
reasonable  person  in  the  defendant's  situation  would  have  had  such
knowledge. Thus, if the seller's belief that there were no termites in
the  house  was  reasonable,  his  misrepresentation  was  not  negligent.
Although  there  are  not  enough  facts  to  determine  whether  a  court
would  come  to  this  conclusion,  D  is  the  only  argument  listed  that
could possibly support the seller's position.

A is incorrect because lack of such knowledge would be negligent if
the reasonable person would have known. Whether or not the seller
had  a  duty  to  disclose  the  presence  of  termites,  when  he  discussed
termites,  he  had  a  duty  to  do  so  honestly  and  reasonably.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  A  statement  is  of  opinion  if  it  concerns  a
subjective  matter  or  contains  an  expression  of  doubt.  Since  the
seller's  statement  was  neither,  it  was  not  of  opinion.  C  is  therefore
correct.

13.  D  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective  condition  when  sold.  Thus,  if  the  supermarket  sold  the
product  while  it  was  defective,  the  supermarket  would  be  held
strictly liable no matter who manufactured it.

Parties  who  work  together  to  accomplish  a  particular  result  are
involved  in  a  concert  of  action  that  may  make  any  one  of  them
vicariously  liable  for  torts  committed  by  the  others.  A  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  facts  indicate  that  the  manufacturers  and
retailer  did  not  work  together  on  manufacturing  or  marketing  the
product.  It  has  been  held  that  where  there  are  a  small  number  of
manufacturers  in  a  particular  industry,  where  all  belong  to  an
industry-wide  association  that  establishes  industry  standards,  where

1006

those  standards  result  in  their  products'  being  defective,  and  where
all  members  of  the  industry  and  the  association  are  named  as
defendants, liability may be imposed on an industry-wide basis. B is
incorrect, however, because there is no indication that the number of
cereal manufacturers is small or that they belong to an industry-wide
association  that  sets  standards  or  that  their  standards  made  the
product  defective  or  that  all  members  of  the  industry  and  their
association  have  been  named  as  defendants.  Under  the  alternate
liability theory, where two or more defendants commit identical acts
of  negligence  under  circumstances  that  make  it  impossible  to  tell
which  one  injured  the  plaintiff,  it  will  be  presumed  that  all  of  them
factually  caused  the  plaintiff's  injury.  C  is  incorrect,  however,
because  there  is  no  indication  that  all  the  parties  named  committed
identical acts of negligence or that any of them was negligent at all.

14. D Assault occurs when, with the intent to induce such apprehension, the
defendant  induces  in  the  plaintiff  a  reasonable  apprehension  that  a
harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  the  plaintiff  will  occur.  Since  the
girl's mother did not fear contact with herself, she was not assaulted.

A and B are incorrect because the kidnapper's conduct did not induce
the girl's mother to apprehend contact with herself. If the kidnapper's
conduct  did  give  the  girl's  mother  reason  to  apprehend  contact  with
herself, it would not matter whether she had perceived contact with
the girl. C is therefore incorrect.

15. A Strict liability is imposed on the keeper of a wild animal, but only for
harm that proximately results from an aspect of the animal that made
keeping  it  dangerous.  Leopards  are  dangerous  because  they  bite  or
attack. The risk that they may clumsily knock someone over is not one
that makes them more dangerous than a dog or other domestic animal.

B is incorrect because an animal is “wild” if it comes from a species
that  cannot  ordinarily  be  safely  kept  without  special  training  or
restraint. Since this is true with leopards, the leopard's tameness does
not prevent it from being so classified. C and D are incorrect because
strict liability does not depend on the reasonableness of a defendant's
conduct.

16.  B  A  claim  for  damages  resulting  from  contact  with  a  product
manufactured  or  sold  by  the  defendant  may  be  based  on  several
theories, including negligence, misrepresentation, breach of warranty,

1007

and  strict  liability  in  tort.  In  most  jurisdictions,  however,  mental
suffering is not a recoverable item of damage in a claim based on any
of these theories unless the mental suffering is the result of a physical
injury  or  has  a  physical  manifestation.  Although  a  few  jurisdictions
permit recovery even in the absence of physical injuries, the argument
in B is the only one listed that could possibly support the defendant's
defense.

A is incorrect for two reasons: First, even without a representation,
the  defendant  could  be  held  liable  on  negligence,  implied  warranty,
or strict liability theories, and second, the statement that the suit was
“strong  enough  to  be  worn  several  times”  was  probably  a
representation. C  is  incorrect  because  none  of  the  theories  requires
that  the  plaintiff  be  in  privity  with  the  manufacturer.  Although  the
argument  in  D  might  provide  an  effective  defense  to  a  negligence
claim, D is incorrect because the other theories that are available do
not depend on unreasonable conduct by the defendant.

17. A Under the all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence, unreasonable
conduct  by  the  plaintiff  that  contributes  to  the  happening  of  an
accident  is  a  complete  bar  to  recovery  by  the  plaintiff.  Thus,  if  the
boy's conduct was unreasonable, the driver's defense of contributory
negligence will succeed.

B,  C,  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the  negligence  of  a  parent  in
supervising a child is not imputed to the child. The reasonableness of
the mother's conduct is therefore not in issue.

18.  C  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective condition when sold. A product is defective if its condition
would defeat the reasonable expectations of the reasonable consumer.
Since  the  reasonable  consumer  probably  would  not  expect  a  brand
new training leash to break when used on a dog of average size and
strength, one that did was probably defective.

Strict  liability  may  be  applied  to  benefit  any  person  whose  contact
with  the  defective  product  was  foreseeable,  so  A  is  incorrect.  B  is
the
incorrect  because  strict 
reasonableness of the defendant's conduct. D is incorrect because the
risk that it describes as foreseeable is not the one that led to the harm
in this case since the device was brand new when it broke.

liability  does  not  depend  on 

19. A A person is liable for all harm that proximately results from his or her

1008

negligence.  Thus,  if  the  aunt  was  negligent  in  giving  the  doll  to  the
boy, she may be held liable for the injury that resulted. It is possible
that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion  since  it  may  have  been
foreseeable  that  a  child  of  the  boy's  age  would  swallow  the  button
and be injured. Although the result is not certain, the argument in A is
the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  a  judgment  for  the
father.

In  every  sale  by  a  merchant,  there  is  an  implied  warranty  that  the
product sold is fit for ordinary use. If the product is unfit, breach of
warranty  liability  is  imposed  without  regard  to  fault.  Similarly,  if  a
product  is  defective  or  unreasonably  dangerous,  strict  tort  liability
may be imposed on the supplier. B, C, and D are incorrect, however,
because these theories are available only against a defendant who is
a professional supplier of products, which the aunt was not.

20. C  The  key  to  this  question  is  that  the  plaintiff  is  basing  his  claim  on
negligence, not strict products liability. Since negligence is a breach
of  the  duty  to  act  reasonably,  the  grocery  store  could  be  held  liable
under that theory only if it acted unreasonably. Since the tablets were
delivered in a sealed bottle, and since the reasonable merchant does
not ordinarily open sealed products before selling them, the grocery
store  probably  did  not  breach  the  duty  that  it  owed  to  the  plaintiff.
While the grocery store could be held liable if the trier of fact found
that  the  reasonable  merchant  would  ordinarily  open  sealed  products
before selling them, C is the best answer out of the choices given.

A is incorrect because a manufacturer's negligence is not imputed to a
retailer. B is based on an incorrect statement of the law. A retailer's
duty is to use reasonable care. The breach of this duty is negligence.
Although a retailer may be held liable without fault under a theory of
strict liability, this liability is based not on the breach of “an absolute
duty,”  but  on  a  policy  that  attempts  to  distribute  the  risks  of  being
injured  by  defective  products.  D  is  incorrect  because  negligence
liability  depends  on  the  foreseeability  of  the  risk,  not  upon  the
existence of any contractual relationship.

21.  C  A  defendant  owes  a  plaintiff  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  if  the
defendant's conduct creates a foreseeable risk to the plaintiff. Thus, if
it  was  foreseeable  that  a  person  would  be  in  the  roadway,  the  taxi
driver owed that person a duty to drive as a reasonable person. Once
it is established that such a duty existed, its breach by driving while

1009

intoxicated is obvious.

Since  the  pedestrian's  presence  in  the  roadway  was  part  of  the  set
stage (i.e., preexisted the defendant's tortious act), it does not matter
whether the circumstances that put her there were foreseeable. A and
B are therefore incorrect. Although a plaintiff must establish that his
or  her  injury  was  a  foreseeable  result  of  the  defendant's  negligent
conduct, he or she is never required to establish that the defendant's
negligence was foreseeable. D is therefore incorrect.

22. B Strict liability is often imposed on one who uses his or her land in a
non-natural manner for the storage of a substance that is likely to do
harm  upon  its  escape  from  storage.  The  storage  of  water  frequently
leads to the application of this principle.

Although  strict  liability  is  imposed  on  one  who  engages  in  an
abnormally  dangerous  activity,  it  is  imposed  only  for  damage  that
results  from  the  dangerous  nature  of  the  activity.  Although  the
operation of a nuclear power plant may be an abnormally dangerous
activity, A is incorrect because harm in this case did not result from
any  of  the  aspects  of  operating  a  nuclear  power  plant  that  make  it
abnormally  dangerous.  If  the  power  company  knew  or  should  have
known that an earthquake might occur in the area of the nuclear power
plant, it might have been unreasonable to operate it there. But absent
such actual or constructive knowledge, the power company's conduct
cannot be presumed to be unreasonable. C is therefore incorrect. The
intervention of an Act of God does not free an antecedent wrongdoer
from  liability  unless  that  intervention  was  unforeseeable.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

in  abnormally  dangerous  activities  such  as 

23.  D  Strict  liability  may  be  imposed  for  damage  resulting  from
the
participation 
manufacture and storage of explosives. Even under a theory of strict
liability,  however,  a  defendant  is  not  liable  for  harm  unless  it  was
proximately  caused  by  the  defendant's  activity.  Conduct  that  is  a
factual  cause  of  harm  is  a  proximate  cause  of  that  harm  if  the  harm
was a foreseeable result and was not brought about by unforeseeable
intervention. Thus, if the intervening conduct of the terrorists was not
foreseeable, 
the  homeowner  was  not
proximately  caused  by  the  conduct  of  the  company.  While  it  is  not
certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  D  is  the  only
argument listed that could possibly support the company's defense.

the  harm  sustained  by 

1010

A is incorrect because strict liability may be imposed regardless of
fault  and  regardless  of  whether  the  defendant's  conduct  was
reasonable. Most jurisdictions hold that there can be no liability for
trespass to land unless there was a physical invasion of the plaintiff's
realty.  B  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  company  may  be  held
liable  on  a  strict  liability  theory,  which  does  not  require  a  physical
invasion.  Even  though  a  defendant's  conduct  was  a  factual  cause  of
harm,  that  defendant  will  not  be  held  liable  if  there  was  an
unforeseeable intervening cause of the harm. C is incorrect, however,
because  the  intervening  cause  will  not  prevent  such  liability  unless
the intervention was unforeseeable.

24. C Nondisclosure of a fact is not an assertion (i.e., representation) unless
the fact is one that is essential to the transaction and the circumstances
are  such  that  the  other  party  is  reasonably  entitled  to  expect
disclosure of it. Since the buyer had no special expertise, his reason
for  purchasing  the  hay  wagon  was  not  a  fact  essential  to  the
transaction, and there were no circumstances that entitled the seller to
expect disclosure of his hope of making a profit.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  slight  differences  in  knowledge
concerning the subject of a particular transaction are not sufficient to
impose a duty of disclosure. D is incorrect because the seller's initial
satisfaction  would  not  prevent  her  from  recovering  if  it  had  been
induced by a misrepresentation by the buyer.

25. C  A  defendant's  conduct  is  not  a  proximate  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm
was  brought  about  by  an  independent  intervening  cause.  An
intervening cause is “independent” if it did not result from one of the
normal  risks  resulting  from  the  defendant's  conduct.  Since  the  first
pilot's plane was safely on the ground at an airport when struck by the
second  pilot's  plane,  it  can  be  argued  that  the  collision  was
independent  of  the  risks  created  by  the  first  pilot's  miscalculation.
While it is not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the
argument in C is the only one listed that could possibly be effective in
the first pilot's defense.

A  plaintiff  may  be  barred  from  recovery  by  assumption  of  the  risk
when the harm results from a danger of which the plaintiff was aware
and  which  he  or  she  voluntarily  encountered.  Since  there  is  no
indication that the first pilot's miscalculation resulted from his lack of
a  commercial  pilot's  license,  the  harm  did  not  result  from  a  risk  of

1011

which the businessman knew. A is therefore incorrect. Under the all-
or-nothing  rule,  a  plaintiff's  negligence  may  prevent  recovery  if  it
was  causally  related  to  the  harm  which  he  or  she  sustained.  Since
there is no indication that the first pilot's miscalculation resulted from
his  lack  of  a  commercial  pilot's  license,  any  negligence  by  the
businessman in accepting a ride from him was not causally related to
the accident. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of
harm if the harm would not have occurred without it. The argument in
D states that the harm would not have occurred if the second pilot had
not  been  negligent.  This  is  obviously  true  and  establishes  that  the
second  pilot's  negligence  was  a  factual  cause  of  the  accident.  The
argument also states, however, that the first pilot's miscalculation was
therefore not a factual cause of the accident. Since the accident would
not have occurred if the first pilot's plane had not been on the ground,
and  since  the  first  pilot's  plane  would  not  have  been  on  the  ground
had  the  first  pilot  not  miscalculated,  the  first  pilot's  miscalculation
was also a factual cause of the accident. D is therefore incorrect.

26.  A  The  patient's  injury  would  not  have  occurred  without  the
manufacturer's  negligence,  so  the  manufacturer's  negligence  was  a
cause of it. Since the patient's injury would not have occurred without
the  doctor's  error,  and  since  the  doctor's  error  came  between  the
manufacturer's conduct and the patient's injury, the doctor's error was
an  intervening  cause  of  the  patient's  injury.  If  negligence  that  is  a
cause of harm is followed by an intervening cause of harm that was
not  foreseeable,  the  intervention  is  regarded  as  a  superseding  cause
that  relieves  the  antecedent  wrongdoer  of  liability.  Thus,  if  the
doctor's  error  was  unforeseeable,  the  manufacturer  would  not  be
liable to the patient.

If  the  doctor's  conduct  was  foreseeable,  it  would  constitute  a
concurring  cause  of  harm  and,  as  such,  would  not  shield  the
antecedent  wrongdoer  from  liability.  This  is  true  whether  that
intervention  was  reasonable  or  not,  and  whether  it  is  classified  as
gross negligence or not. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

27.  B  Almost  all  theories  of  products  liability  require  that  the  plaintiff's
contact  with  the  product  be  foreseeable.  Since  hypodermic  needles
are  commonly  used  by  doctors  to  give  injections  to  patients,  the
patient's contact with the needle is foreseeable.

It  is  less  foreseeable,  if  it  is  foreseeable  at  all,  that  a  child  would

1012

play  with  a  hypodermic  needle,  so  A  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect
because none of the products liability theories permit the recovery of
losses that are unrelated to personal injury or property damage. D is
incorrect because there is no indication that the needle was infected
when sold by the manufacturer or that the infection resulted from the
manufacturer's negligent conduct.

28. B Trespass to land is defined as intentional entry on the plaintiff's realty
without authorization. Since realty includes the airspace immediately
above the land, the crop duster entered the gardener's realty when she
flew through the air 15 feet above his land. Although she believed that
she  had  authority  to  do  so,  she  did  not  have  such  authority.  Her
overflight  was,  thus,  a  trespass  if  her  entry  onto  the  realty  was
intentional.  A  defendant  has  the  necessary  intent  to  be  liable  for
trespass to land if he or she desires or knows that his or her act will
result  in  an  entry  onto  the  realty  that  he  or  she  entered.  This  is  so
regardless  of  whether  he  or  she  knows  whose  realty  he  or  she  is
entering,  or  that  the  entry  is  unauthorized.  Since  the  crop  duster  did
desire to fly over parcel 621, she had the necessary intent and will be
liable for trespass to the land of the gardener.

Without  intent,  there  is  no  trespass  liability.  A  is  incorrect  because
participation in an abnormally dangerous activity does not satisfy the
requirement of intent. C is incorrect because intent means a desire to
enter the land or airspace above it (without regard to knowledge of
the plaintiff's right). D is incorrect because damage to the realty is not
an essential element of trespass to land.

29. D  The  tort  known  as  invasion  of  privacy  can  be  committed  in  various
ways. One, called “intrusion,” is committed by intentionally invading
the  plaintiff's  right  to  solitude  in  a  manner  that  would  offend  the
reasonable person. An invasion of the plaintiff's solitude occurs when
the defendant causes a physical entry into the plaintiff's private space.
Since  the  reporter  deliberately  entered  the  senator's  private  office,
opened  the  senator's  private  file,  and  copied  the  senator's  private
documents,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  reporter  intentionally  invaded
the senator's solitude. Although it can never be certain that a court or
jury will decide that the reasonable person would have been offended
by  any  particular  conduct,  D  is  the  only  answer  listed  that  could
possibly be correct.

A and B  are  incorrect  because  freedom  of  the  press  under  the  First

1013

Amendment  does  not  privilege  invasions  of  privacy  for  the  purpose
of obtaining documents, even if they are newsworthy. C is incorrect
for two reasons: First, the documents were not made public until after
the  reporter  invaded  the  senator's  privacy  by  obtaining  them,  and
second,  the  privilege  to  publish  facts  that  are  matters  of  public
records  does  not  include  a  privilege  to  invade  privacy  for  the
purpose of obtaining them.

30.  D  The  facts  specify  that  the  plaintiff's  claim  is  for  negligence.
Negligence is unreasonable conduct. It may be unreasonable to sell a
device as dangerous as an air rifle to an 11-year-old because the risk
that he or she will use it to shoot another child is foreseeable. In any
event, D is the only finding listed that could result in a judgment for
the plaintiff.

A is incorrect because negligence of a manufacturer is not imputed to
a retailer. B and C  are  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  there  is  no
indication  that  the  air  rifle  was  defective,  and  second,  negligence
liability requires unreasonable conduct, and there is no indication that
the  defendant  acted  unreasonably.  Thus,  even  if  the  air  rifle  was
defective, there would be no reason to impose negligence liability on
the defendant.

31. D Since the car dealer knew that the mechanic's repairs were frequently
not  successful  until  the  third  or  fourth  attempt,  it  was  probably
unreasonable  for  the  car  dealer  to  trust  him  with  the  repair  of  a
condition that the car dealer knew made the car unsafe to drive. While
it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  the
argument  in  D  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  a
judgment for the plaintiff.

the  doctrine  of  respondeat  superior,  an  employer 

is
Under 
vicariously  liable  for  torts  of  an  employee  committed  within  the
scope  of  employment.  In  determining  whether  one  who  renders
services to the defendant is an employee, courts generally hold that if
the  employer  has  a  right  to  control  the  details  of  performance,  the
worker is an employee, while if the employer does not have a right to
control  the  details  of  performance,  the  worker  is  an  independent
contractor.  Since  the  car  dealer  did  not  control  the  details  of  the
the  mechanic  probably  was  not  an
mechanic's  performance, 
employee.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Statutory  duties  are  sometimes
held to be “non-delegable,” but B  is  incorrect  because  no  statute  is

1014

given. Since employers of independent contractors are not ordinarily
held  vicariously  liable  for  the  torts  of  those  contractors,  C  is
incorrect.

32. D Like other suppliers of products, a retailer owes its customers a duty
to act reasonably. This includes a duty to make whatever inspection is
reasonable.  Sometimes  the  circumstances  make  it  reasonable  for  a
retailer to make no inspection at all, but in such a case, no inspection
constitutes a reasonable inspection.

A,  B,  and  C  are  incorrect  because  under  some  circumstances  the
conduct  specified  would  not  be  reasonable.  (Note:  Beware  of
statements  that  are  overly  broad  or  general.  For  example,  some
writers and judges have stated that “a retailer owes the customer no
duty  to  inspect  products  furnished  by  reputable  manufacturers.”  Do
you think that this statement would be true if the retailer knew that a
shipment  of  glassware  furnished  by  a  reputable  manufacturer  was
dropped by the delivery company, or that many customers had found
dead  rats  in  the  jars  of  peanut  butter  that  were  furnished  by  a
reputable  manufacturer?  It  is  safer  to  recognize  that  a  retailer,  like
any  other  supplier  of  products,  owes  customers  a  duty  to  act
reasonably,  and  that  under  some  circumstances,  failure  to  inspect
merchandise  furnished  by  reputable  manufacturers  is  reasonable,
while under other circumstances, it is not.)

33.  B  There  can  be  no  liability  for  defamation  unless  the  defendant
intentionally or negligently communicated the defamatory statement to
a person other than the plaintiff. Communication of the accusation to
the  employee's  mother  would  satisfy  this  requirement  only  if  the
employer  knew  or  should  have  known  that  she  would  see  the  letter
that contained them.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  statements
actually were communicated to the employee's mother, who read the
letter.  Courts  have  sometimes  held  that  an  employer  who  defames  a
former employee in a communication with a prospective employer of
that  former  employee  is  privileged  if  he  or  she  believes  reasonably
and  in  good  faith  that  his  or  her  statements  are  true.  This  reasoning
does  not  apply  to  the  facts  given,  however,  because  the  employer's
statements  were  not  being  made  to  a  prospective  employer  of  the
employee. D is therefore incorrect.

34. A Strict liability is imposed on the professional seller of a product that
is in defective condition when sold. Neither the pilot's partner nor the
mechanic sold the helicopter, so B, C, and D are incorrect.

35. B A trespassing child is entitled to reasonable care if it was foreseeable
that a child would trespass and be injured, and if the child's age made
it  likely  that  he  or  she  would  fail  to  recognize  the  danger.  Thus,
although  the  boy  was  a  trespasser,  the  fact  that  the  gravel  pit  owner
could  foresee  his  presence  and  foresee  that  he  would  be  injured  by
the  proximity  of  the  hill  to  the  road  imposed  upon  the  gravel  pit
owner the duty to act reasonably and to keep the premises reasonably
safe.  If  the  gravel  pit  owner's  failure  to  erect  a  fence  was
unreasonable,  the  gravel  pit  owner  was  negligent  and  probably  is
liable to the boy.

The phrase “danger invites rescue” is usually used to explain why a
person  who  created  a  danger  to  another  owed  a  duty  of  reasonable
care  to  a  rescuer  who  came  to  the  aid  of  that  other.  A  is  incorrect
because it has no application to these facts. “Last clear chance” is a
doctrine  that  accomplishes  only  one  thing:  Under  the  proper
circumstances,  it  negates  the  effect  of  a  plaintiff's  contributory
negligence.  Only  the  plaintiff  raises  it,  and  only  for  the  purpose  of
negating  the  effect  of  his  or  her  own  negligence.  C  is  incorrect
because it would put the argument at the disposal of a defendant. An
intervening  cause  does  not  free  an  antecedent  wrongdoer  from
liability unless its occurrence was unforeseeable. Thus, the mere fact
that the car driver's conduct was an intervening cause would not lead
to a judgment for the gravel pit owner. D is therefore incorrect.

36. B A misrepresentation is a false assertion of material fact made for the
purpose  of  inducing  the  plaintiff's  reliance.  If  the  defendant  knows
that  the  assertion  is  false,  and  damages  result  from  the  plaintiff's
justified  reliance  on  it,  the  defendant  may  be  held  liable.  It  may  be
argued  successfully  that  by  concealing  the  crack,  the  seller  falsely
asserted  that  it  did  not  exist.  No  liability  will  result  from  that
assertion, however, unless the buyer relied on it. A plaintiff relies on
a  misrepresentation  when  it  is  a  significant  factor  in  the  plaintiff's
decision.  Since  the  buyer  discovered  the  crack,  the  assertion  that  it
did not exist could not have been a factor in his decision to buy the
car. For that reason, he did not rely on it and is not entitled to recover
damages.

1016

A  is  incorrect  because  a  court  would  probably  hold  that  the
affirmative act of concealing the crack was an assertion that it did not
exist.  Since  the  buyer  did  not  rely  on  the  seller's  representation,  it
does not matter whether such reliance would have been justified. C is
therefore  incorrect.  Since  the  facts  indicate  that  the  buyer  was
required  to  spend  $500  on  repairs,  D  is  an  inaccurate  statement  of
fact and is therefore incorrect.

37. B Under the all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence, a plaintiff is
completely  barred  from  recovering  damages  if  his  or  her  own
unreasonable conduct contributed to the occurrence. Since the second
driver  saw  the  first  driver  in  the  intersection,  it  was  probably
unreasonable, and therefore contributorily negligent, for him to enter
the intersection when he did.

The doctrine of last clear chance does no more than negate the effect
of  a  plaintiff's  contributory  negligence.  If  a  defendant  had  “the  last
clear  chance”  to  avoid  injuring  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant  might  be
held  liable  in  spite  of  the  plaintiff's  negligence.  The  plaintiff  never
loses  a  case,  however,  simply  because  that  plaintiff  had  “the  last
clear chance” to avoid being injured. A is therefore incorrect. C and
D  are  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  presumption  that  results
from  a  defendant's  violation  of  a  statute  (sometimes  called
negligence  per  se)  may  ordinarily  be  rebutted  by  proof  that  the
violation resulted from circumstances beyond the defendant's control,
and  second,  even  if  the  first  driver  could  not  rebut  the  presumption
that he was negligent, the second driver's contributory negligence is
still available to him as a defense.

38.  A  Although  the  phrase  “AS  IS”  disclaims  implied  warranties  of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, it does not free a
seller  from  the  duty  of  acting  reasonably.  Since  it  probably  was
foreseeable that the purchaser of a refrigerator would plug it in even
after being advised that it did not work, the store owner had a duty to
take reasonable precautions against the harm that might result. If her
failure to warn the customer was unreasonable, it was negligence that
was a proximate cause of harm and would result in liability.

B is incorrect because the phrase “AS IS” is an effective disclaimer
of the implied warranty of merchantability (i.e.,  fitness  for  ordinary
use). C  is  incorrect  because  the  store  owner  is  still  liable  under  a
negligence theory. D is based on a misinterpretation of the doctrine of

1017

last clear chance, which accomplishes nothing more than undoing the
effect of a plaintiff's contributory negligence. (If a defendant had “the
last clear chance” to avoid injuring the plaintiff, the defendant might
be  liable  in  spite  of  the  plaintiff's  negligence.  The  plaintiff  never
loses  a  case,  however,  simply  because  that  plaintiff  had  “the  last
clear chance” to avoid being injured.)

39. B Self-defense is a privilege to use reasonable force to defend oneself
against a threatened contact. Reasonable force is that force that would
appear necessary to the reasonable person. Courts generally hold that
it  is  reasonable  to  use  deadly  force  in  defense  against  what
reasonably appears to be a threat of deadly force.

A is incorrect because it is never reasonable to use deadly force for
the  sole  purpose  of  preventing  a  trespass  to  land  or  chattel.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  defendant's  initial  use  of  gentle  force  was
privileged in defense of property, making the plaintiff's response to it
a  threatened  battery.  The  plaintiff's  trespass  did  not  end  when  he
completed  his  entry  but  continued  so  long  as  he  refused  to  leave  in
response to the defendant's demand. D is therefore incorrect.

40.  A  One  who  keeps  a  wild  animal  is  strictly  liable  for  harm  that
proximately results from keeping it. An animal is “wild” if it comes
from  a  species  that  cannot  ordinarily  be  kept  safely  without  special
training or restraint. For this purpose, the wildcat was a wild animal
even though it had been tamed.

The  terms  foreseeable  and  unforeseeable  are  mutually  exclusive.
Thus if the cat's behavior was unforeseeable, it could not have been
foreseeable.  B  is  incorrect  for  this  reason,  and  because  the
foreseeability of harm is not in itself sufficient to result in liability. C
is  incorrect  for  several  reasons:  First,  res  ipsa  does  not  apply  in
strict  liability  cases;  second,  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  the
injury  would  not  ordinarily  have  occurred  without  negligence;  and
third, res ipsa  does  not  apply  when  there  is  direct  evidence  of  the
defendant's  conduct.  D  is  incorrect  because  private  nuisance  is  an
interference with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy realty, and there
was no interference with the plaintiff's right to use or enjoy realty.

41.  D  If  a  product  fails  to  live  up  to  an  express  assertion  of  fact  that  a
supplier made about it, the supplier may be liable without regard to
fault on theories of breach of express warranty and misrepresentation.

1018

For  this  purpose,  an  assertion  of  fact  may  be  made  by  the  use  of
models  or  pictures.  The  photo  on  the  box  probably  was  an  express
assertion that the helmet was suitable for use as a motorcycle helmet.
Since  it  was  not  suitable  for  such  use,  the  company  is  liable  for
breach of express warranty and misrepresentation. In addition, strict
products  liability  may  be  imposed  for  damage  that  results  from  a
defect  in  a  product  supplied  by  a  defendant.  For  this  purpose,  a
product  is  defective  if  its  condition  would  defeat  the  reasonable
expectations of the reasonable consumer. Since the photo on the box
showed the helmet being used as a motorcycle helmet, the reasonable
person probably would have expected it to be suitable for such use.
Since it was not, the company is strictly liable for damage.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  misrepresentation  and  strict  products
liability  theories  discussed  above  do  not  require  privity  between
defendant  and  plaintiff,  and  because  under  the  express  warranty
theory,  it  has  been  held  that  the  necessary  privity  exists  between
anyone who made the express assertion and anyone who relied on it.
B is incorrect because even if the product was not intended for use as
a motorcycle helmet, the photo on the box probably was an assertion
that  it  was  suitable  for  such  use.  C  is  incorrect  for  three  reasons:
First, the jurisdiction's “pure comparative negligence” system would
diminish the plaintiff's recovery in proportion to his own fault, but it
would not completely bar that recovery; second, since the purpose of
a  motorcycle  helmet  is  to  protect  the  user  in  an  accident,  the
defendant's  assertion  and  the  reasonable  person's  expectation  might
have been that the helmet would be effective even if the accident was
the  wearer's  own  fault;  and  third,  most  jurisdictions  hold  that
comparative negligence is not a defense to actions that are not based
on fault (i.e., breach of warranty, misrepresentation, or strict products
liability).

42. A The statute given is typical of the “owner-consent” statute that exists
in a number of jurisdictions. It requires the owner to pay for the tort
committed  by  the  driver.  Whenever  the  law  imposes  vicarious
liability on one for damage that another has caused, the one who pays
is entitled to complete indemnity from the one who should have paid.

B  would  be  correct  if  the  accident  resulted  from  some  fault  by  the
owner in addition to that of the mechanic, but it is incorrect because
there  is  no  indication  that  the  owner  acted  unreasonably.  C  is

1019

incorrect  because  there  is  no  factual  basis  for  determining  that  the
owner  is  himself  responsible  for  any  portion  of  the  loss.  D  is
incorrect because of the owner's right of indemnity.

43. A  Commercial  suppliers,  such  as  the  wholesaler,  are  strictly  liable  if
they sell a defective product that injures a foreseeable plaintiff, such
as  a  purchaser.  Here,  the  seeds  were  defective  since  they  were
poisonous, and the breeder was a foreseeable plaintiff.

Since  the  dealer  sold  the  seeds  in  the  same  package  in  which  they
came, the dealer's failure to inspect them was foreseeable whether or
not  it  was  reasonable.  B  is  incorrect  because  a  foreseeable
intervention,  even  if  unreasonable,  does  not  free  an  antecedent
wrongdoer  from  liability.  Although  liability  for  breach  of  warranty
may  require  privity,  the  theories  of  negligence  and  strict  liability  in
tort  do  not.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  strict
liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a  defective
condition when sold, without regard to the possibility that some other
seller of the same product might be liable. Thus, a manufacturer and
retailer of a defective product may be jointly and severally liable as
joint tortfeasors.

44. A  Since  the  coming  of  a  rescuer  is  generally  viewed  as  a  foreseeable
result  of  peril,  negligence  that  causes  peril  is  often  held  to  be  a
breach of a duty owed to a rescuer. Thus, if the swimmer's negligence
caused the need for the rescuer to rescue him, it was a breach of duty
owed to the rescuer.

B is incorrect because if the swimmer had not acted negligently, there
would be no basis for holding him liable to the rescuer. The phrase
“danger  invites  rescue”  is  often  used  to  explain  why  one  who
imperils another owes a duty of reasonable care to a rescuer attracted
by  that  peril.  If  that  principle  had  any  application  to  these  facts,  it
would  be  to  establish  liability,  not  to  free  the  swimmer  from  such
liability.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  An  intervening  cause  does  not
prevent  an  antecedent  wrongdoer  from  being  liable  unless  the
intervention was unforeseeable. D is therefore incorrect.

45. B  There  is  some  question  about  whether  it  is  defamatory  to  say  that  a
person is impoverished or on the verge of bankruptcy. But even if the
defendant's  statement  was  defamatory,  it  was  oral  and,  therefore,
classified  as  slander.  Ordinarily,  there  is  no  liability  for  slander

1020

unless the plaintiff establishes actual damage to his or her reputation.
Since the company did not believe what the defendant told him, there
was no damage to the plaintiff's reputation, and the defendant will not
be held liable for saying it.

A is incorrect because mental suffering is not an essential element of
defamation.  Since  liability  for  defamation  is  imposed  on  the
publisher  of  a  defamatory  statement,  the  fact  that  the  defendant  was
only repeating what he heard would not in itself protect him against
liability.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  Since  publication  is  defined  as
communication to any person other than the plaintiff, D is incorrect.

46. C Since negligence is defined as a failure to act reasonably in the face
of a foreseeable risk, the defendant cannot be called negligent if the
reasonable  person  in  the  defendants'  situation  would  not  have  acted
any differently than the defendant did.

Assumption of the risk requires that the plaintiff have knowledge of
the  risk  that  he  or  she  is  voluntarily  encountering.  Since  there  is  no
indication  that  the  plaintiff  knew  of  the  risks  associated  with
exposure  to  the  material,  A  is  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the
defendant's  lack  of  knowledge  would  not  prevent  liability  if  the
reasonable  person  in  the  defendant's  situation  would  have  known.
Workers'  compensation  may  be  the  exclusive  remedy  against  an
injured party's employer, but since the plaintiff did not work for the
defendant, D is incorrect.

47. B A claim for private nuisance can be asserted only by a plaintiff who
claims that the defendant's conduct interfered with his or her use and
enjoyment  of  realty  in  which  he  or  she  has  a  present  or  future
possessory interest. Since the gardener held a leasehold interest and
the  landlord  a  reversion,  they  can  successfully  assert  a  private
nuisance claim.

A is incorrect because as a tenant, the gardener had sufficient interest
in the realty. C and D are incorrect because, since the employee was
only  an  employee  of  the  gardener,  he  lacked  the  property  interest
necessary to the assertion of the claim.

48.  A  Trespass  to  chattel  is  intentional  interference  with  the  plaintiff's
chattel  resulting  in  damage.  For  this  purpose,  intent  consists  of  a
desire or knowledge that the chattel will be involved, without regard
to whether the defendant knows that the chattel is the plaintiff's or that

1021

the plaintiff's rights are being violated. Interference can consist of any
act regarding the chattel that only its rightful possessor is entitled to
perform. Since the defendant desired to take that particular coat, she
had the necessary intent, regardless of her belief that the coat was her
own.  Since  only  the  plaintiff  was  entitled  to  take  the  coat,  the
defendant  interfered  with  it.  Since  the  coat  was  destroyed  while  the
defendant  possessed  it,  her  interference  resulted  in  damage  to  the
plaintiff. The defendant is therefore liable to the plaintiff for trespass
to chattel.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  tort  was  committed  when  the  defendant
took the coat and the tort led to the coat's destruction. In trespass to
chattel, intent does not require knowledge that the chattel belongs to
another, or that the defendant's act will affect the rights of another. C
is  therefore  incorrect.  Trespass  to  chattel  was  committed  when  the
defendant  took  the  coat.  If  she  had  succeeded  in  returning  the  coat,
damages might have been mitigated (i.e., reduced), but the tort would
not  have  been  undone.  D  is  incorrect  because  her  unsuccessful
attempt to return the coat could not even mitigate damages.

49. C Liability is imposed on a defendant for damage that was proximately
caused  by  the  defendant's  negligence.  Since  it  is  given  that  the
hospital was negligent in keeping the trucker waiting six hours, it is
necessary  to  determine  whether  that  negligence  was  a  proximate
cause of his injury in the earthquake. Conduct is a proximate cause of
harm  if  it  was  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  that  harm.  Conduct  is  a
factual cause of harm if the harm would not have occurred without it.
Since the trucker would not have been struck by the debris that fell in
the earthquake if he had not been present, the delay occasioned by the
hospital's negligence was a factual cause of his injury. If conduct is a
factual cause of harm, it is a legal cause if the harm was foreseeable.
Thus,  if  it  was  foreseeable  that  the  trucker  would  be  injured  by  an
earthquake, the hospital's negligence was a legal cause of that injury
and the hospital is liable for it. Otherwise, the hospital is not liable.
Here,  the  fact  that  an  earthquake  had  never  occurred  before  likely
made the earthquake unforeseeable.

“Good  Samaritan”  statutes,  where  they  exist,  only  protect  doctors
who  voluntarily  render  emergency  aid  at  the  scenes  of  accidents.  A
is,  therefore,  incorrect.  Although  the  liability  of  an  antecedent
wrongdoer  might  depend  on  whether  subsequent  intervention  was

1022

foreseeable,  since  the  doctor's  conduct  preceded  the  hospital's,  the
hospital's  liability  does  not  depend  on  whether  the  doctor's  conduct
was  foreseeable.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  too  absolute  a
statement to be correct. Even if a hospital owes its patients some duty
with respect to natural disasters, that duty is only to act reasonably in
the face of them.

50. D If the seller of a product knows the buyer's purpose in buying it, and
he knows also that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill in selecting
a product to suit that purpose, the sale is accompanied by an implied
warranty  that  the  product  is  fit  for  the  buyer's  particular  purpose
(UCC  §2-315),  even  where  that  purpose  is  identical  to  the  ordinary
use of such a product. Similarly, even where the implied warranty of
fitness  for  the  buyer's  particular  purpose  is  present,  the  implied
warranty  of  merchantability  accompanies  every  sale  by  a  merchant
(UCC §2-314) unless it is effectively disclaimed.

51. D The defendant is not liable for harm unless its conduct was a factual
and legal cause of it. Its conduct was a factual cause of harm only if
the  harm  would  not  have  occurred  without  it.  If  the  force  of  the
collision would have caused a good pole to fall, then the fact that the
pole was rotten is not a factual cause of its falling.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  they  do  not  establish  that  the
defendant's conduct was a factual cause of harm, and liability cannot
be  imposed  unless  it  was.  If  the  defendant's  conduct  was  a  factual
cause of harm, the driver's intervention might be a superseding cause
that protects the defendant from liability, but only if the intervention
was  unforeseeable.  This  does  not  necessarily  depend  on  whether  it
was criminal or grossly negligent. C is therefore incorrect.

52.  A  The  statute  given  is  typical  of  the  “pure  comparative  negligence”
approach. Since the car driver's loss amounted to $10,000, and since
it  was  40  percent  his  own  fault,  40  percent  of  $10,000  (or  $4,000)
must be deducted from his recovery. The balance that he is entitled to
collect is $6,000. Therefore, B, C, and D are incorrect.

53.  A  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective condition when sold. Since the bolt was cracked when the
sled left the sled factory, the sled company would be held liable if the
crack constituted a defect.

B and C are incorrect because the use or sale by the boy would not

1023

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

prevent  the  imposition  of  strict  liability  if  the  sled  was  defective
when  it  left  the  sled  factory,  so  long  as  such  use  or  sale  did  not
substantially  change  its  condition.  D  is  incorrect  because  strict
liability  in  tort  does  not  depend  on  unreasonable  conduct  by  the
defendant.

54. A Negligence is the failure to act as a reasonable person would act in
the  face  of  risks  that  are  foreseeable  or  known  to  exist.  Since  a
reasonable person would not ordinarily subject others to unnecessary
risks, it would probably have been unreasonable (i.e., negligent) for
the attorney to subject the client to the danger of a defective elevator
if  the  attorney  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the  danger.  Here,
leading the client to the elevator minutes after it plunged downward
was likely unreasonable.

However,  if  the  attorney  did  not  act  unreasonably,  he  would  not  be
negligent even though he occupied the entire second floor. Thus, B is
incorrect.  Ordinarily,  obligations  in  a  lease  flow  only  between
parties  to  that  lease.  Some  jurisdictions  hold  that  a  landlord's  lease
obligation  to  keep  premises  in  good  repair  may  impose  on  the
landlord  a  duty  to  invitees  of  tenants.  C  is  incorrect,  however,
because the attorney continues to be liable for the proximate results
of his own negligence even though the landlord might also be liable.
While  a  tenant  might  not  have  an  obligation  to  repair  the  leased
premises, D is incorrect because the attorney might be liable for his
negligence in allowing the client to use the elevator.

55. C One who enters the realty of another to retrieve a chattel that got there
through no fault of his or her own has a qualified privilege to do so,
but he or she must compensate the landholder for any actual damage
that results.

A  and  D  are  therefore  incorrect.  Unless  damage  to  the  realty  of
another  results  from  participation  in  an  abnormally  dangerous
activity, liability for it is imposed only if the entry resulted from fault
(i.e., was intentional or negligent). Since transporting gravel is not an
abnormally  dangerous  activity,  and  since  the  gravel  was  spilled
without any fault on the part of the trucker, the trucker is not liable for
damage resulting from spilling the gravel. B is therefore incorrect.

56. D One who voluntarily encounters a known risk assumes that risk and is

not entitled to damages resulting from it.

1024

A, B, and C are all incorrect since assumption of risk is available as
a defense in claims based on negligence or strict liability. In addition,
B is incorrect because horses are not regarded as wild animals, and
C is incorrect because the fact that the trainer had been warned of the
animal's  propensity  indicates  that  the  horseman's  conduct  was
reasonable.

57.  A  The  phrase  “AS  IS”  disclaims 

the 

implied  warranty  of
merchantability.  In  addition,  it  may  be  argued  that  it  modifies  any
express  warranties  or  representations  that  resulted  from  the  car
dealer's  assurance  that  he  believed  the  car  to  be  in  good  condition,
and that it would have placed the reasonable consumer on notice that
the  car  might  not  be  in  good  condition.  In  any  event,  A  contains  the
only combination of conclusion and reason that are reasonably related
to each other.

B is incorrect because all jurisdictions permit an action for breach of
the implied warranty of merchantability to be brought by any member
of  the  purchaser's  household.  C  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the
phrase “AS IS” disclaimed the implied warranty that the car was fit
for ordinary use.

58. A In an action for conversion, the defendant is liable for the full value of
the  chattel  at  the  time  of  conversion.  Consequently,  the  plaintiff  can
recover  the  value  of  the  car  at  the  time  she  delivered  it  to  the
defendant. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

59.  D  Negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct.  If  the  company  did  not  act
unreasonably, it could not have been negligent. Although a court might
not come to this conclusion, the argument in D is the only one listed
that could possibly support the company's defense.

A  is  incorrect  because  contributory  negligence  is  unreasonable
conduct  by  a  plaintiff.  In  this  case,  the  plaintiff  is  the  girl,  not  the
cleaner. B and C are incorrect because an intervening cause of harm
does not cut off a wrongdoer's liability unless that intervening cause
was unforeseeable.

60. B A landholder is entitled to use reasonable force to prevent a trespass.
Serious or deadly force is not regarded as reasonable, however, since
human life is much more valuable than mere property. The use of such
force is therefore a battery.

1025

Negligence  is  the  breach  of  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  owed  by  the
defendant  to  the  plaintiff.  Ordinarily,  a  defendant  owes  a  plaintiff  a
duty  of  reasonable  care  if  the  defendant's  conduct  creates  a
foreseeable risk to the plaintiff. Thus, if the risk to persons entering
on legitimate business was foreseeable, the warehouse owner owed a
duty of reasonable care to such persons. This does not mean that he
owed  such  a  duty  to  everyone,  however,  or  that  he  owed  it  to  the
burglar. A is incorrect for this reason and because of a rule applied
by  most  jurisdictions  that  a  landholder  owes  no  duty  of  reasonable
care to trespassers. C  is  incorrect  because  no  rule  of  law  prohibits
the  use  of  mechanical  devices  unless  they  inflict  excessive  force.
Although courts have made statements like that in D, it is irrelevant
here  since  the  device  did  not  injure  an  innocent  bystander.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

61. A  An  intentional  exercise  of  dominion  and  control  over  a  chattel  by  a
defendant  is  a  conversion  if  the  plaintiff  was  lawfully  entitled  to
possession of the chattel, and if he or she was thereby damaged. In a
conversion  case,  “intent”  means  a  desire  (or  knowledge  with
certainty)  that  the  defendant's  act  will  affect  the  particular  chattel
involved.  In  this  case,  the  neighbor's  desire  to  make  the  television
hers and to carry it off satisfies the intent requirement, even though it
was reasonable for her to believe that the sale was legitimate.

B and C are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect since the plaintiff need
not be in possession of the chattel at the time of conversion, so long
as he or she had a right to possess it.

62. B  A  guest  rides  free.  If  something  of  value  —  like  rides  on  alternate
days  —  is  given  in  return  for  passage,  courts  will  conclude  that  the
passenger  was  not  a  guest  for  purposes  of  the  automobile  guest
statute.

In  a  negligence  claim,  the  existence  of  insurance  coverage  is  not
relevant  in  determining  liability.  A  is  incorrect  for  this  reason  and
because  the  “guest”  statute  was  originally  created  to  protect
insurance  companies  against  collusive  claims.  Recklessness  or
aggravated negligence is usually held to be actionable in the face of a
statute that prohibits actions for negligence. C is incorrect, however,
because  the  facts  do  not  indicate  the  conscious  disregard  of  an
obvious  and  serious  risk  that  aggravated  negligence  requires.  D  is
probably  an  accurate  statement.  It  is  incorrect,  however,  because  it

1026

does not justify non-enforcement of the statute.

63. B A defendant manufacturer can be relieved of strict products liability if
an  intermediate  handler  of  the  product  substantially  changes  the
product before sending it on through the stream of commerce.

Strict  liability  may  be  imposed  regardless  of  whether  the  defendant
was negligent. Since the basis of the volunteer firefighter's action is a
claim that the product was defective (i.e., strict liability in tort), the
fact  that  the  company  acted  reasonably  would  not  furnish  it  with  an
effective  defense.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  plaintiff  assumes  the
risk when he or she knows of it and voluntarily encounters it. Since
the  volunteer  firefighter  had  never  heard  of  the  device  before,  he
could  not  have  known  of  the  risk  or  assumed  it.  C  is  therefore
incorrect. An intervening cause of harm is one that came between the
defendant's  conduct  and  the  plaintiff.  It  is  “independent”  if  it  is  not
related to the risk created by the defendant. D is incorrect because a
plaintiff's  own  conduct  is  not  usually  regarded  as  an  intervening
cause of harm.

64. B Since it is given that the injury to the baker's nose resulted from the

eye doctor's negligence, the eye doctor is liable for it.

It  is,  of  course,  possible  for  harm  to  have  more  than  one  proximate
cause. Thus, even if the neighbor's conduct was a proximate cause of
the injury, the eye doctor's conduct may also be a cause of it, making
the eye doctor liable as a joint tortfeasor. (In most jurisdictions, joint
tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable.) A is therefore incorrect.
Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm  would  not  have
occurred  without  it.  Since  the  injuries  to  the  baker's  elbow  and
shoulder would have occurred even without the negligence of the eye
doctor, his conduct was not a factual cause of those injuries, and the
eye doctor could not be held liable for them. C and D are therefore
incorrect.

65.  A  One  who  holds  himself  or  herself  out  to  be  an  attorney,  even  if
unlicensed,  is  required  to  act  like  a  reasonable  attorney.  If  the
attorney did not, he will be held liable for damages that proximately
resulted.

Negligence does not lead to liability unless it is a cause of damage.
Thus,  although  violation  of  a  statute  sometimes  results  in  a
presumption of negligence, it does not result in liability unless it was

1027

a cause of the plaintiff's damage. Negligence is not a cause of damage
that  would  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  licensed  attorneys
sometimes  lose  cases,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  attorney  would  not
have lost the case if he had had a license. B and C are incorrect for
this  reason  and  because  courts  usually  hold  that  violation  of  a
licensing statute does not result in a presumption of negligence. D is
incorrect because even though an attorney does not guarantee results,
he or she is liable for damages that result from his or her negligence.

66. C Consent means willingness, and the affirmative defense of consent is
effective  because  of  the  rule  that  a  plaintiff  who  is  willing  for  a
particular thing to happen to him or her has no right to complain when
it does. For this reason, a defendant does not commit a tort when he
or  she  does  something  to  which  the  plaintiff  has  consented.  If  the
defendant  induces  his  or  her  consent  by  fraud,  however,  the  consent
does  not  have  this  effect  and  does  not  privilege  the  defendant's
conduct.  A  defendant  induces  consent  by  fraud  when  he  or  she
knowingly misrepresents the nature of the act to which the plaintiff is
consenting. Thus, if the hypnotist told the plaintiff that the cattle prod
would produce no real discomfort when he knew that this was false,
he  fraudulently  induced  her  consent  to  contact  with  it  and  was  not
privileged by her consent.

the  hypnotist  was  not  always  successful 

In A, the plaintiff consented to the contact even though she was aware
in  hypnotizing
that 
volunteers,  and  that  if  he  was  not  successful  in  hypnotizing  her,  the
cattle prod might cause discomfort. Since she knew the nature of the
act  to  which  she  was  consenting,  her  consent  would  furnish  the
hypnotist with a privilege. A is therefore incorrect. In B, although the
hypnotist defrauded the plaintiff by promising money that he did not
intend to pay, the fraud did not relate to the nature of the act to which
she  was  consenting.  He  would,  therefore,  be  privileged  by  her
consent, and B is therefore incorrect. A mistake that induces consent
does  not  destroy  the  effect  of  that  consent  unless  the  defendant  is
aware  of  the  mistake.  Since  there  is  no  indication  in  D  that  the
hypnotist was aware of the plaintiff's mistake regarding the effect of a
cattle prod, her consent privileged him, and D is therefore incorrect.

67. A A statement is defamatory if it is likely to cause a substantial group of
respectable  people  to  lose  respect  for  the  person  about  whom  it  is
made. A statement that the professor drank a large quantity of alcohol

1028

might  be  defamatory  because  many  people  regard  such  conduct  as
disreputable,  and  because  it  implies  that  the  professor's  public
statements were dishonest. A statement that she drank a large quantity
of  fruit  juice  clearly  would  not  be  defamatory.  If  an  allegedly
defamatory statement is ambiguous (i.e., has two possible meanings),
it is held to mean what the reasonable person would think it means.
Thus,  the  statements  made  in  the  photo  and  caption  would  not  have
been defamatory if the reasonable person would have believed them
to mean that the professor drank fruit juice. If the reasonable person
would have read the story, he or she would have known that this was
what the statements in the photo and caption meant.

B  and  C  are  incorrect  because  the  standard  used  to  determine  the
meaning of an ambiguous statement is objective and does not depend
on  what  any  particular  group  of  persons  thought.  D  is  incorrect
because  if  the  reasonable  person  would  not  have  read  the  story,  the
photo  and  caption  might  mean  that  the  professor  had  drunk  a  large
quantity of alcohol, and thus it might be a defamatory statement.

68. D Liability for misrepresentation may be imposed upon a defendant who
makes  an  intentionally  (or,  in  some  jurisdictions,  negligently)  false
assertion  of  fact  upon  which  the  plaintiff  justifiably  relies  to  his  or
her  detriment.  The  athlete's  only  assertion  of  fact  was  that  he  ate
candy  bars  for  energy.  There  is  no  indication,  however,  that  this
assertion was false. The athlete made no assertion about the flavor of
the  candy  bar,  so  even  if  the  plaintiff's  dislike  of  the  flavor  can  be
regarded as damage, it is not damage that proximately resulted from
his reliance on an assertion by the athlete.

A is incorrect because misrepresentation liability can be imposed on
anyone  who  makes  a  misrepresentation,  and  also  because  the  facts
indicate  that  the  athlete  is  in  the  business  of  selling  candy.  If  the
athlete's  statements  were  misrepresentations,  the  fact  that  he  said
them  could  result  in  liability  even  though  they  were  written  by
someone  else.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because
liability for intentional misrepresentation may be imposed to benefit
anyone  who  was  damaged  by  his  or  her  justified  reliance  on  the
misrepresentation, regardless of privity.

69.  B  Although  blasting  is  generally  recognized  to  be  an  ultra-hazardous
activity,  strict  liability  applies  only  to  harm  that  resulted  from  the
risks that made the activity ultra-hazardous. The possibility of noise

1029

frightening  animals  accompanies  a  great  many  activities  that  are  not
ultra-hazardous,  so  it  is  probably  not  one  of  the  risks  that  makes
blasting ultra-hazardous.

A is incorrect because the breeder's phone call announcing that harm
was  occurring  on  his  farm  made  it  foreseeable  that  harm  would
continue  to  occur  there  if  the  activity  was  continued.  C  is  incorrect
because  strict  liability  may  be  imposed  even  though  the  defendant
acted reasonably. While the demolition contractor's relationship with
the builder might impose liability on the builder as well, it would not
relieve  the  demolition  contractor  from  liability  for  his  acts.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

70. C An invitee is one whose presence confers an economic benefit on the
landholder.  That  which  enables  a  tenant  to  do  business  on  the
premises  confers  economic  benefit  on  the  landholder  by  making  the
premises  attractive  to  the  tenant.  This  applies  to  the  presence  of  a
tenant's  employees,  and  makes  them  invitees  of  the  landlord.
Contributory (comparative) negligence is unreasonable conduct by the
plaintiff. If the reasonable person in the employee's shoes would have
seen and avoided the dangerous condition, then the employee's failure
to do so was negligent.

71. C Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer is vicariously
liable for the negligence of an employee committed within the scope
of  employment.  An  employee  is  acting  within  the  scope  of
employment if his or her conduct is intended to further the interests of
his or her employer and if his or her employer has a right to control
his or her conduct. Since the building inspector was attempting to find
out  whether  the  drapes  were  fire-retardant,  which  was  part  of  what
the city hired her to do, and since the city had the right to tell her how
to  test  drapes,  she  was  acting  within  the  scope  of  her  employment
even if she was violating specific instructions that she received from
the city.

A is therefore incorrect. B is a fabrication with no basis in law, since
even  when  an  employee's  conduct  is  unsupervised,  respondeat
superior may result in the imposition of vicarious liability on his or
her employer. D is incorrect because under respondeat superior, an
employer is vicariously liable only for that for which the employee is
liable.

1030

72. C It may have been unreasonable for the defendant to leave his keys in
the  ignition.  If  so,  he  was  negligent.  Even  if  his  conduct  was  not
unreasonable, his violation of the ignition key statute may result in a
presumption  of  negligence  if  the  statute  was  designed  to  prevent
accidents  involving  stolen  cars.  Negligence  does  not  result  in
liability,  however,  unless  it  is  a  proximate  (i.e.,  factual  and  legal)
cause of harm. Conduct is a factual cause of harm if the harm would
not  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  the  monkey  probably  would  not
have moved the defendant's car and struck the plaintiff with it had the
defendant not left his key in the ignition, the defendant's conduct was a
factual  cause  of  the  plaintiff's  injury.  A  factual  cause  of  harm  is  a
legal cause if the harm was foreseeable and not brought about by an
unforeseeable intervening cause (i.e., a superseding cause). Since the
accident would not have occurred without the monkey's conduct, and
since the monkey's conduct came between the defendant's conduct and
the  plaintiff's  injury,  it  was  an  intervening  cause.  If  it  was
unforeseeable, it was a superseding cause of the plaintiff's harm, and
the  defendant's  conduct  was  not  a  proximate  cause  of  it.  Thus,  the
plaintiff will lose his case against the defendant unless it is found that
the monkey's intervention was foreseeable. This is unlikely.

Even if the defendant's conduct was reasonable, his violation of the
statute  might  result  in  a  presumption  of  negligence.  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  Even  if  the  violation  of  the  statute  does  not  result  in  a
presumption  of  negligence,  the  defendant's  conduct  might  have  been
unreasonable  and  therefore  negligent.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  an  intervening  cause  of  harm  is  not  superseding
unless it was unforeseeable.

73. A  Appropriation  of  identity  is  committed  when  the  defendant,  without
the plaintiff's permission, uses the plaintiff's identity for a commercial
purpose. Since the photographer sold games that were imprinted with
the  governor's  likeness,  a  court  could  conclude  that  he  is  liable  for
appropriation.

Public disclosure is committed when the defendant publicly discloses
a  private  fact  about  the  plaintiff,  the  disclosure  of  which  would
offend the reasonable person in the plaintiff's position. Since a photo
of  the  governor's  face  as  it  appeared  in  a  public  place  is  obviously
not  a  private  fact,  B  is  incorrect.  Intrusion  is  committed  by
intentionally  invading  the  plaintiff's  private  space  in  a  manner  that

1031

would offend the reasonable person in the plaintiff's position. Since
the  photographer  snapped  the  photo  in  a  public  place,  he  did  not
invade the governor's private space, and C is incorrect. False light is
committed  by  publishing  false  statements  about  the  plaintiff  that,
although not defamatory, are in some way embarrassing or damaging.
Since  the  photographer  did  not  publish  any  statements  about  the
governor, D is incorrect.

74.  D  False  imprisonment  requires  intentional  confinement,  which  is  an
overcoming  of  the  plaintiff's  will  to  leave.  Since  a  sleeping  person
has no will to leave, the student was not confined by the locked door.

A is therefore incorrect. B is based on an inaccurate statement since
the risk probably was not a foreseeable one, but it is incorrect in any
event  because  false  imprisonment  requires  intent.  If  the  professor
intentionally confined the student, she would be held liable for all the
harm that foreseeably resulted. C is incorrect, however, because she
did not confine him.

75.  A  In  a  defamation  action  by  a  private  person  against  a  professional
publisher  (media  defendant),  the  plaintiff  must  prove  either  actual
malice or negligence. If the newspaper knew the statement to be false,
it  had  actual  malice.  If  the  reasonable  publisher  would  have  known
the statement to be false, the newspaper acted negligently.

B describes actual malice and is incorrect because a plaintiff who is
not  a  public  person  is  not  required  to  prove  actual  malice.  C  is
incorrect because no liability can be imposed unless the newspaper
knew, or reasonably should have known, that the statement was false.
D  is  incorrect  since  liability  without  fault  cannot  be  imposed  in  an
action  for  defamation  against  a  professional  (media  defendant)
publisher.

76. C Strict liability means that the seller of a product is liable without fault
for personal injuries or other physical harm caused by the product if
the product is sold in a defective condition. Once a defect is found,
the  seller  is  liable  even  if  he  or  she  used  all  possible  care.
Importantly,  strict  liability  applies  not  only  to  the  manufacturer,  but
also to the retailer and any other person in the distribution chain who
is in the business of selling such products. Consequently, a retailer is
strictly liable for selling the defective product even if the retailer is
non-negligent  and  even  if  the  retailer  could  not  have  discovered  the

1032

defect.  Here,  since  the  defendant  sold  the  defective  product,  he  is
liable  even  though  he  sold  the  saws  without  opening  the  boxes  and
could not have possibly discovered the defect before the plaintiff was
injured. A and B are therefore incorrect.

There was no indication that selling saws made by the manufacturer
was unreasonable. D is therefore incorrect.

77.  A  Holders  of  land  owe  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  travelers  who
foreseeably  deviate  onto  the  land  for  reasons  related  to  their  use  of
the  adjacent  public  way.  Here,  the  fact  that  the  road  was  curvy  and
known  for  numerous  accidents  likely  made  the  driver's  accident
foreseeable.

B is incorrect because the mere fact that the homeowner knew drivers
used  the  neighboring  road  is  not  enough.  C  is  incorrect  because
although the reason given explains why the homeowner's conduct was
not  negligent,  it  fails  to  explain  why  he  had  no  duty.  Although  a
landholder generally owes no duty of reasonable care to a trespasser,
D  is  incorrect  because  a  strayed  traveler  as  described  above  is
entitled to reasonable care as an exception to the general rule.

78.  C  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm  would  not  have
occurred  without  it.  Since  medical  assistance  was  summoned  just  a
moment later, and since the facts do not indicate that the truck driver
was  worse  off  for  the  momentary  delay,  the  carpenter's  failure  to
summon aid was not a cause of harm.

Most jurisdictions agree that a landholder owes no duty of reasonable
care  to  a  trespasser.  When  the  landholder  knows  of  the  trespasser's
presence, however, and knows that the trespasser has been imperiled
by some affirmative act of the landholder, the landholder does have a
duty to act reasonably to protect the trespasser from that act. Since the
carpenter knew that his act of throwing the hammer created the need
for aid, he probably did owe the truck driver a duty to act reasonably
in summoning it. A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Punitive  damages  may  be
available  against  a  defendant  who  intended  harm  by  his  or  her  act.
Intent  requires  a  substantial  certainty  that  the  harm  will  probably
occur, however. Knowledge that harm is possible is not intent and is
not sufficient to result in liability for punitive damages. B is therefore
incorrect.  A  user  of  the  public  way  who  enters  upon  private  land
foreseeably and in connection with his or her use of the public way is

1033

entitled to some measure of reasonable care. D is incorrect, however,
because  he  or  she  does  not  thereby  become  an  invitee,  and,  further,
because  the  truck  driver's  entry  onto  the  carpenter's  realty  was  not
connected with the truck driver's use of the public way.

79. C  A  private  individual  may  sue  for  public  nuisance  only  if  his  or  her
damages  were  different  in  kind  from  those  sustained  by  the  general
public.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  the  fact  that  the  defendant's  conduct
preexisted  the  plaintiff's  presence  is  not,  by  itself,  a  defense  to
nuisance unless it can be shown that the plaintiff came to the nuisance
specifically for the purpose of instituting litigation. D is an incorrect
statement  of  the  law;  even  a  lawful  activity  may  constitute  a  public
nuisance if it is conducted in a way that unreasonably interferes with
the rights of the public.

80.  C  Consent  —  the  plaintiff's  willingness  —  is  a  complete  defense  to
most  intentional  tort  actions.  Consent  is  implied  if  the  reasonable
person  would  infer  from  the  plaintiff's  conduct  and  the  surrounding
circumstances  that  the  plaintiff  is  willing  for  the  defendant's  act  to
occur. The fact that the defendant and the plaintiff have been enjoying
each  other's  jokes  for  years  could  result  in  the  inference  that  the
plaintiff was willing to have a joke played upon him. Although it is
not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the argument in
C is the only one listed that could support the defendant's defense.

A  is  incorrect  because  assault  requires  apprehension  of  harmful
contact  but  not  necessarily  of  battery.  Ordinarily,  the  apprehension
experienced  by  the  plaintiff  must  be  such  as  a  reasonable  person  in
his or her shoes would experience. B is incorrect, however, because
an exception to this objective standard is made when the plaintiff has
a  special  sensitivity  about  which  the  defendant  knows,  and  the
defendant  knew  that  the  plaintiff  was  terrified  of  spiders.  D  is
incorrect  because  assault  requires  an  intent  to  cause  apprehension,
not necessarily an intent to cause injury.

81.  C  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm  would  not  have
occurred  without  the  conduct.  Since  there  is  no  way  of  knowing
whether  the  defendant's  shot  struck  the  plaintiff,  it  cannot  be
established  that  the  plaintiff's  harm  was  factually  caused  by  the
defendant's conduct. (Note: Do not confuse these facts with the rule

1034

of Summers v. Tice, 199 P.2d 1 (1948) where both negligent persons
were named as defendants.)

The  defendant's  duty  of  reasonable  care  might  not  require  the  same
vigilance that would be required in an urban area, but A is incorrect
because  the  possibility  that  someone  would  come  by  required  some
vigilance. Since it is likely that a person struck by a pellet shot from a
slingshot would be seriously injured, it is probably unreasonable to
shoot a slingshot without taking some precaution against hitting other
persons.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  If  the  defendant's  conduct  was  a
factual cause of the harm, it was a legal cause of the harm if the harm
was foreseeable. Since it is clearly foreseeable that a person struck
by a slingshot pellet will sustain an injury, D is incorrect.

82.  C  Although  the  law  recognizes  a  special  standard  for  judging  the
negligence  of  children,  it  is  applied  only  when  the  youth  of  the
defendant  is  likely  to  prevent  him  or  her  from  exercising  the  same
mature  judgment  as  an  adult.  When  a  child  is  old  enough  to  have
acquired the judgment of an adult with respect to a particular activity,
the child standard no longer applies. It is rare for a court to apply the
child standard to persons over the age of 14 years.

A is therefore incorrect. An adult activity is one that is substantially
more  likely  to  be  dangerous  when  performed  by  a  child  than  by  an
adult, or one in which only adults traditionally engage. B is incorrect
because fishing is neither. The balancing test that is sometimes used
to  determine  whether  conduct  is  negligent  weighs  the  risks  that
foreseeably  result  from  acting  a  certain  way  against  the  utility  of
acting that particular way. D is incorrect because it distorts that rule
by weighing the risk of handling a fishhook in whatever way the girl
was handling it against the utility of fishing in general.

83.  A  Strict  liability  in  tort  is  imposed  on  the  supplier  of  a  product  for
damages that result from a defect in the product that existed at the time
it  left  that  supplier's  hands  and  that  made  the  product  unreasonably
dangerous.  Since  a  defect  is  a  condition  that  would  defeat  the
reasonable  expectations  of  the  reasonable  consumer,  and  since  the
reasonable  consumer  probably  does  not  expect  to  find  a  rat's  tail  in
food  products,  the  presence  of  a  rat's  tail  was  probably  a  defect.
Since  a  product  is  unreasonably  dangerous  if  the  benefits  of  its
condition are outweighed by its disadvantages, and since the presence
of a rat's tail has no advantage and is likely to be a source of disease

1035

and disgust in a person eating it, the presence of a rat's tail in a food
product probably makes that product unreasonably dangerous.

B is incorrect because strict liability in tort may be imposed for the
benefit  of  any  plaintiff  whose  contact  with  the  product  was
foreseeable,  without  regard  to  the  existence  of  a  contractual
relationship  (i.e.,  privity).  Although  the  sale  of  a  product  by  a
merchant implies a warranty that the product is merchantable (i.e., fit
for ordinary use), C is incorrect because the question stem specifies
the theory of strict liability in tort, and this theory does not depend on
the existence of an implied promise. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur
is  applied  to  establish  an  inference  that  the  defendant  acted
unreasonably. Since the reasonableness of the defendant's conduct is
not relevant to the imposition of strict liability, D is incorrect.

84.  C  A  parent's  claim  for  medical  bills  incurred  as  a  result  of  injuries
negligently  inflicted  on  a  child  is  a  derivative  one,  subject  to  any
defenses that could have been raised in response to an action by the
child.  Here,  the  boy's  negligence  could  be  asserted  by  the  driver  in
response to a claim by the boy. Additionally, since the mother is the
plaintiff, her negligence can be asserted by the driver. Consequently,
the driver can raise both the boy's and the boy's mother's negligence
as a defense.

85. D Violation of a statute is relevant to the question of negligence only if
the  statute  violated  was  designed  to  protect  a  class  of  persons  to
which the plaintiff belongs against risks like the one that resulted in
harm  to  the  plaintiff.  Since  insurance  would  not  have  prevented  the
trailer  hitch  from  failing,  the  statute  was  not  designed  to  protect
against the risk that it would. Its violation is therefore not relevant.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  violation  is  not
relevant  unless  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect  against  the  risk
involved. Public policy generally prohibits disclosing to a jury that a
defendant was or was not insured. Such disclosure is not absolutely
prohibited, however, since there are circumstances under which such
disclosure could be made to a jury (e.g., to establish ownership of a
vehicle). C  is  thus  based  on  an  over-inclusive  statement  of  the  law
and is therefore incorrect.

86. C An inference of negligence may be established under the doctrine of
res ipsa loquitur when the accident was one that would not ordinarily

1036

have  occurred  without  negligence,  and  the  circumstances  eliminate
the  probability  that  the  negligence  was  anyone's  but  the  defendant's.
Bottles  don't  usually  explode  unless  the  company  that  was  in
exclusive control of the bottling process acted negligently, so res ipsa
frequently  is  applied  in  exploding  bottle  cases.  But  where,  as  here,
some  other  event  was  as  likely  a  cause  of  the  explosion,  res  ipsa
cannot be applied.

A and B are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because the fact that
the bottles were not in the defendant's possession when the accident
occurred is not in itself sufficient to eliminate the probability that the
negligence was anyone's other than the defendant's.

87. B A person who sells services rather than goods does not generally fall
within standard strict liability. Consequently, since the contractor was
not  selling  the  glue  itself,  he  could  not  be  held  strictly  liable  for  its
defect. However, the neighbor could recover in strict liability against
the  manufacturer,  because  the  glue  was  defective,  was  sold  by  the
manufacturer, and proximately caused the injury to the neighbor.

A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

88.  C  An  essential  element  of  tort  liability  for  misrepresentation  is  the
defendant's  intent  to  induce  the  plaintiff's  reliance  with  his  or  her
statement. If the dealer did not know that the buyer would rely on the
statements that she made to the collector, she could not have intended
to  induce  the  buyer's  reliance  on  those  statements.  Since  there  is  no
indication that the dealer was aware that the buyer had overheard her
conversation with the collector, C is correct.

A  is  over-inclusive  and  therefore  incorrect.  Statements  of  opinion,
especially  when  made  by  experts,  may  be  regarded  as  assertions  of
fact  (i.e.,  the  fact  that  the  speaker  actually  held  that  particular
opinion).  Since  the  buyer  paid  $225,000  for  something  worth  only
$600  based  on  his  belief  in  what  he  had  overheard,  he  did  sustain
damage  as  a  result  of  his  reliance  on  the  dealer's  statement.  B  is
therefore incorrect. D is incorrect for two reasons. First, as indicated
above, an expert may incur misrepresentation liability by stating that
he  or  she  holds  an  opinion  that  he  or  she  doesn't  actually  hold.
Second,  the  dealer's  statement  was  not  only  an  evaluation  of  the
painting's value, but also a statement about who had painted it.

89.  D  Intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  requires  intentional,

1037

outrageous  conduct  that  results  in  severe  mental  suffering.  Since  the
plaintiff  did  not  experience  any  mental  injury,  the  defendant  is  not
liable to her for this tort.

Conduct  is  “outrageous”  if  it  exceeds  all  bounds  normally  tolerated
by decent society and is calculated to cause mental suffering. Conduct
is “calculated to cause mental suffering” if suffering in the mind of a
reasonable  person  is  an  almost  inevitable  result.  The  defendant's
conduct probably was both. A and B are incorrect, however, because
the  plaintiff  sustained  no  mental  injury.  Outrageous  conduct  is
“intentional”  if  the  defendant  desired  or  knew  with  substantial
certainty that it would result in mental suffering in the plaintiff. C is
incorrect  because  the  defendant  might  have  had  such  a  desire  or
knowledge, even though his motive was only to play a joke.

90.  D  A  seller  of  products  owes  his  or  her  customers  the  duty  to  act
reasonably.  If  it  would  be  reasonable  to  inspect  a  product  before
selling it, then the druggist owes his customers a duty of doing so.

A, B, and C are over-inclusive statements. Since some of the harmful
side  effects  or  defects  associated  with  a  particular  drug  might  be
unknown even to the reasonable druggist, a druggist cannot be said to
have a duty to know them all. (Note: A druggist who sells a defective
drug  may  be  held  strictly  liable  for  damages  that  result.  This  is
because  strict  liability  is  not  based  on  fault,  however,  and  does  not
justify the conclusion set forth in C.)

91. D Persons engaged in a concert of action are regarded as members of a
joint  enterprise.  As  such,  they  are  vicariously  liable  for  torts
committed by other members of the enterprise. Thus, the man and his
friend may each be held liable for the other's tort.

To  recover  against  either  or  both  of  them,  the  plaintiff  need  prove
only that his injury was caused by the negligence of some member of
the  enterprise.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  suggests  that  one  thing
cannot be a cause of harm if some other thing is. Since any effect may
have  more  than  one  cause,  B  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because
nothing can be a legal cause of harm unless it is a factual cause of that
harm.

92. D Negligence does not result in liability unless it was a proximate cause
of  damage.  Although  the  attorney's  failure  to  commence  the  patient's
action  against  the  doctor  was  probably  negligent,  no  liability  will

1038

result  unless  the  attorney's  negligence  was  a  proximate  cause  of
damage. If the patient would have lost her lawsuit against the doctor
anyway,  the  attorney's  failure  to  institute  it  did  not  result  in  damage
since the patient lost nothing as a result. If the doctor's use of the drug
did not result in damage to the patient, the doctor would not have been
liable to her even if her conduct was negligent. If the drug saved the
patient's  life  at  the  expense  of  her  eye,  it  probably  did  not  result  in
damage, since what the patient gained from its use exceeded what she
lost. This means that the patient would have lost her lawsuit against
the doctor, and that the attorney's failure to assert it did not result in
damage.

A  is  incorrect  because  even  an  inexperienced  lawyer  is  required  to
act  as  the  reasonable  attorney.  The  attorney's  honest  belief  is  no
defense unless the reasonable attorney would have held it. B and C
are therefore incorrect.

93. C Under pure comparative negligence statutes, a plaintiff's recovery in a
negligence  action  is  diminished  in  proportion  to  the  plaintiff's  fault,
but  it  is  not  barred  by  the  plaintiff's  own  negligence.  Thus,  the
plaintiff  would  be  entitled  to  recover  part  of  any  damages  that  she
sustained  as  a  result  of  the  defendant's  conduct  if  the  defendant's
conduct was unreasonable.

In most jurisdictions, a landholder owes a duty of reasonable care to
an  invitee  but  owes  no  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  a  trespasser.  For
this purpose, an invitee is one whose presence confers an economic
benefit on the landholder, and a trespasser is one who enters without
permission.  Since  the  plaintiff's  use  of  the  defendant's  pool  was
consideration  for  valuable  services  that  she  rendered,  she  was  an
invitee. Under the “attractive nuisance” doctrine, a trespassing child
may be entitled to reasonable care, but it is inapplicable here because
the  plaintiff  was  an  invitee  rather  than  a  trespasser.  A  and  B  are
therefore  incorrect.  If  the  plaintiff's  conduct  was  unreasonable,  the
amount  of  her  damages  would  be  diminished  accordingly.  The
language  of  option  D  may  suggest  defenses  based  on  comparative
negligence and on assumption of the risk. If it suggests a comparative
negligence  defense,  it  is  incorrect  because  in  a  pure  comparative
negligence system, the plaintiff's recovery is diminished in proportion
to  his  or  her  own  fault  but  is  not  barred  completely.  In  most
jurisdictions, assumption of the risk is a complete bar to recovery by

1039

the plaintiff. A plaintiff assumes the risk when he or she voluntarily
encounters  a  risk  of  which  he  or  she  knows.  The  knowledge
requirement is subjective, meaning that unless the plaintiff himself or
herself  was  aware  of  the  risk,  the  fact  that  the  reasonable  person
would  have  been  aware  is  irrelevant.  D  is  also  incorrect  for  this
reason,  and  because  the  facts  indicate  that  the  plaintiff  dove  in
without looking and was thus unaware that the pool was empty.

94. C Since the plaintiff entered without the company's permission, she was
a trespasser. Ordinarily, a landholder owes trespassers, even if they
are  children,  no  duty  of  reasonable  care  with  respect  to  dangerous
conditions  of  the  premises.  A  trespassing  child  may  be  entitled  to
reasonable  care,  however,  if  it  was  foreseeable  that  children  would
trespass,  it  was  foreseeable  that  a  child  who  trespassed  would  be
injured,  and  if  the  child  was  too  young  to  comprehend  the  danger.
Thus,  if  the  plaintiff  was  old  enough  to  comprehend  the  danger
associated  with  an  attempt  to  climb  the  pole,  the  company  owed  no
duty of reasonable care to protect her against it. Although a minority
of  jurisdictions  holds  that  a  landholder  owes  a  duty  of  reasonable
care  to  all  who  enter,  C  is  correct  because  it  is  the  only  argument
listed that could provide the company with an effective defense in any
jurisdiction.

A  is  incorrect  because  under  the  rule  stated  above,  a  duty  of
reasonable care may be owed to a trespassing child. The fact that no
child had ever before attempted to climb the pole would not prevent
the rule from being applied if it was foreseeable that a child would
do  so  in  the  future.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because
even if the company could not repair the fence, there may have been
other  steps  that  the  reasonable  person  in  the  company's  position
would have taken to prevent the danger that resulted in the plaintiff's
injury.

95.  B  The  homeowner's  lawsuit  may  be  founded  either  on  negligence  or
upon  strict  products  liability.  Negligence  involves  unreasonable
conduct.  If  the  explosives  were  properly  labeled,  the  company's
conduct was not unreasonable. Strict liability is imposed only if the
product that caused harm left the defendant in a defective condition. A
product may be defective because of the way in which it is labeled,
but  if  the  labels  were  properly  affixed  when  the  cases  left  the
company's plant, the product was not defective at the time it left the

1040

company's hands.

A is incorrect because strict liability may be imposed even though the
defendant acted reasonably. C is incorrect because the negligence of
a company employee would be imputed to the company. Although the
storage  of  explosives  is  usually  regarded  as  an  ultra-hazardous
activity, resulting in the imposition of strict liability upon one storing
it,  D  would  not  furnish  the  company  with  a  defense  since  the
imposition  of  liability  on  the  warehouse  would  not  prevent  liability
from being imposed on the company.

96. D A private nuisance is liability-forming conduct by the defendant that
unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy his
or her property. Liability is formed if the defendant intends to invade
the  plaintiff's  rights.  After  speaking  with  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant
now intends his invasion because he is now acting with either desire
or  substantial  certainty  that  the  interfering  conduct  will  occur.
Consequently,  if  the  interference  is  unreasonable,  the  defendant  is
liable. This is the only theory listed that could result in a judgment for
the plaintiff.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  theory  requires  some  physical  intrusion
into the plaintiff's presence, and there is no indication the restaurant
or the college kids are doing so. B is incorrect because the plaintiff is
not complaining of or seeking damages for severe mental suffering. C
is  incorrect  because  trespass  requires  tangible  entry  onto  the
plaintiff's land, and none has occurred.

97. D Misappropriation of identity is an invasion of privacy that consists of
the  unauthorized  use  of  the  plaintiff's  identity  for  a  commercial
purpose. Since the cigar company used the comedian's name without
his permission for the purpose of selling its product, it has committed
this tort against the comedian.

Although the truth of the statement made in the advertisements might
justify  its  publication  for  some  purposes,  its  use  for  a  commercial
purpose  is  not  privileged.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Although  the
protection  of  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution
has been extended to commercial expression, it has not been extended
to  the  unauthorized  use  of  another's  identity  for  a  commercial
purpose. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because liability for
misappropriation of identity does not depend on the foreseeability of

1041

the defendant's conduct.

98. A Tort liability may be imposed only for harm that resulted from intent,
negligence, or any activity for which strict liability may be imposed.
Since there is no indication that the defendant intended the harm, and
since  her  activity  was  not  an  abnormally  dangerous  one,  the  only
theory available to the plaintiff is negligence. Negligence is a breach
of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  The  duty  exists  if  the  defendant's
conduct creates a foreseeable risk to the plaintiff. Since the operation
of a motor vehicle on a roadway creates foreseeable risks to persons
owning property along the roadway, the operator of a vehicle owes a
duty of reasonable care to such persons. The question of whether the
defendant breached that duty depends on whether the defendant acted
reasonably.

A professional seller of products (i.e., a merchant) may be held liable
for damage resulting from a defect in a product that he or she supplied
on theories of strict liability in tort or breach of the implied warranty
of  merchantability.  Since  the  defendant  did  not  supply  the  trailer,
however,  neither  of  these  theories  can  be  applied  to  her.  Thus,  the
questions of whether the hitch was defective or whether the defendant
was  a  merchant  are  not  relevant.  B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.
Although negligence liability is often made to depend on whether the
reasonable  person  in  the  position  of  the  defendant  would  have
foreseen  the  harm,  D  is  incorrect  because  it  is  never  necessary  that
the harm be foreseeable to the plaintiff.

99. A  The  old  rule  that  “he  or  she  who  holds  the  land  holds  upward  unto
heaven”  is  no  longer  true.  All  jurisdictions  agree  that  a  flight  over
land is a trespass to the land only if it was below a certain altitude
(although  they  frequently  disagree  about  what  that  altitude  is).  Thus,
unless the woman can prove the altitude at which the pilot hovered,
she cannot establish a trespass.

B is incorrect because damage is not an essential element of an action
for trespass to land. C is incorrect since an action for trespass is not
one  for  invasion  of  privacy,  but  rather  for  invasion  of  the  right  to
exclusive  possession  of  realty.  D  is  incorrect  because  even  one
whose possession is unlawful may sue for trespass.

100. D A person entitled to possess a chattel who enters the realty of another
for the purpose of recovering that chattel is privileged to make such

1042

entry,  provided  that  he  or  she  does  so  in  a  reasonable  manner  (and
provided further that the chattel did not get onto the realty through any
fault  of  his  or  her  own).  The  woman's  entry  onto  the  homeowner's
realty  was  therefore  privileged.  Since  the  woman's  entry  was
privileged, the homeowner was not entitled to use force against her to
defend his realty, and his use of such force constituted a battery.

A  privilege  to  use  force  against  the  wrongful  dispossessor  of  a
chattel  exists  only  when  that  force  is  used  in  hot  pursuit  of  the
dispossessor.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  hot  pursuit  is  not  a
prerequisite to the privilege to enter realty to recover a chattel. B is
incorrect  because  injury  is  not  an  essential  element  of  battery.  C  is
incorrect  because  a  possessor  of  realty  is  privileged  to  use
reasonable force to prevent a trespass to that realty.

101.  C  An  action  for  misrepresentation  requires  proof  that  the  defendant
made  a  statement  that  he  or  she  knew  or  should  have  known  was
false,  for  the  purpose  of  inducing  plaintiff's  reliance,  and  that  the
plaintiff  was  damaged  by  his  or  her  justified  reliance  on  the
statement.  The  facts  given  establish  that  the  employee  made
statements to the husband for the purpose of inducing him to settle his
claim.  The  husband's  independent  consultation  with  the  attorney
would at least create a jury question about whether the husband was
acting  in  reliance  on  the  employee's  statements.  The  fact  that  the
wrongful death suit would have resulted in a judgment for the husband
in  excess  of  $1,000  would  have  to  be  proven  to  establish  that  the
employee's  statements  were  false  and  that  the  husband's  reliance  on
them led to damages. The fact that the employee knew or should have
known  that  the  statements  were  false  would  have  to  be  proven  to
show that the employee had the necessary fault.

102.  D  Private  nuisance  may  consist  of  an  intentional  and  unreasonable
interference with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy his or her realty.
Interference is intentional if the defendant is substantially certain that
it will occur. Since the company continued testing dog whistles after
the breeder notified it that the testing procedure was interfering with
the  breeder's  business,  the  interference  with  the  breeder's  use  and
enjoyment  of  land  was  intentional.  The  interference  was  not
unreasonable,  however,  unless  the  company's  conduct  would  have
interfered with ordinary use or enjoyment of the breeder's realty. So,
if the breeder's damage resulted from an unusually sensitive use of the

1043

breeder's  land,  it  would  not  be  the  result  of  an  unreasonable
interference.  Since  only  dogs  could  hear  the  sound,  and  since  most
people  are  not  in  the  business  of  keeping  dogs,  the  argument  in  D
might  be  successful.  Of  the  arguments  listed,  it  is  the  only  one  that
could possibly be successful.

A  is  incorrect  because  even  a  lawful  business  may  constitute  a
private nuisance if it is operated in a way that unreasonably interferes
with  the  use  and  enjoyment  of  the  plaintiff's  realty.  B  is  incorrect
because  if  a  defendant's  activity  unreasonably  interferes  with
plaintiff's  use  and  enjoyment  of  his  or  her  realty,  the  fact  that  the
defendant was engaging in it before the plaintiff arrived is not in itself
sufficient  to  prevent  that  activity  from  being  characterized  as  a
nuisance.  Since  the  intent  requirement  is  satisfied  by  the  company's
knowledge  that  its  activity  was  interfering  with  the  breeder's  use  of
his land, C is also incorrect.

103. A An express warranty is a representation regarding a condition of the
product sold. Liability for breach of express warranty is imposed on
the warrantor, regardless of fault, if the product's failure to be what it
was  represented  to  be  results  in  damage.  If  the  label  said  that  the
product would not harm the skin, the fact that it harmed the plaintiff's
skin would be a breach of warranty.

Although  liability  may  be  imposed  for  the  breach  of  an  implied
warranty  of  fitness  for  ordinary  use  (i.e.,  merchantability),  express
warranty liability requires some assertion of fact about the product. B
is  therefore  incorrect.  Liability  for  breach  of  express  warranty  is
imposed on whoever made the warranty that was breached. A retailer
who delivers a product makes whatever warranties are printed on its
label.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  liability  for
breach of express warranty is imposed without regard to fault.

104.  A  As  a  general  rule,  the  courts  hold  that  the  coming  of  a  rescuer  is
foreseeable. This is what is meant by the well-known phrase “Danger
invites  rescue.”  For  this  reason,  one  who  unreasonably  creates  a
danger to any human being — including himself or herself — creates
a  risk  to  a  potential  rescuer  as  well  and  owes  a  potential  rescuer  a
duty  of  reasonable  care.  Thus,  if  the  defendant's  conduct  was
unreasonable, it was a breach of a duty he owed the plaintiff.

B is based on an over-inclusive statement of law — a rescuer's right

1044

to  collect  from  the  person  whom  he  or  she  rescued  must  be  based
either  on  the  breach  of  duty  to  act  reasonably  or  on  an  implied
contract.  An  officious  intermeddler  is  a  person  who  acts  without  a
legitimate reason. C  is  incorrect  because  a  human  life  was  at  stake,
giving  the  plaintiff  a  legitimate  reason  to  act.  The  rule  that  is
characterized  by  the  phrase  “Danger  invites  rescue”  makes  D
incorrect  because  the  rescuer's  attempt  to  rescue  the  defendant  is
regarded as foreseeable for the reason given.

105. B Negligence is a failure to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable
risk. If it was not foreseeable that the contents of the package would
cause  harm  to  a  passenger  in  her  car,  the  defendant's  conduct  with
respect  to  the  package  could  not  have  been  negligent.  Although  it  is
not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the argument in
B is the only one listed that is supported by the facts.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  rule  limiting  the  duty  owed  to  a  licensee
applies  only  to  conditions  of  realty  occupied  by  a  defendant.
Contributory negligence is unreasonable conduct by the plaintiff that
contributes to the happening of the accident. Since the plaintiff could
not have known that the contents of the package were caustic, there is
no  reason  to  conclude  that  his  conduct  was  unreasonable.  C  is
therefore incorrect. A plaintiff is said to have assumed the risk when
he or she voluntarily encounters a known risk. D is incorrect because
the  plaintiff  did  not  know  that  the  contents  of  the  package  were
caustic, and touching it did not, therefore, constitute an encounter with
a known risk.

106. A Strict liability in tort may be imposed upon a professional supplier of
products who places a defective product into the stream of commerce.
Since  a  tattoo  artist  does  not  sell  tattoo  needles  to  his  or  her
customers, he or she does not place them in the stream of commerce,
and  he  or  she  cannot  be  held  strictly  liable  for  damage  that  results
from his or her customer's contact with them.

B  is  incorrect  because  strict  liability  is  imposed  regardless  of  fault
and therefore may be imposed on a defendant although he or she did
not  exercise  any  control  over  the  quality  of  the  product.  A  plaintiff
assumes a risk when he or she knows of it and voluntarily encounters
it. Although the defendant informed the plaintiff that the process was
likely to be a painful one, there is no indication that the plaintiff knew
that the needle would break off in her skin. C is therefore incorrect.

1045

Strict  liability  may  be  imposed  upon  the  supplier  of  defective
products  without  regard  to  whether  those  products  would  be
dangerous  without  the  defect  (i.e.,  inherently  dangerous).  D  is
therefore incorrect.

107.  C  False  imprisonment  consists  of  the  intentional  confinement  of  the
plaintiff. Confinement is an overcoming of the plaintiff's will to leave
in  a  manner  that  would  overcome  the  reasonable  person's  will  to
leave. Since the reasonable person usually obeys the directions of a
police officer, the police officer's words would have been sufficient
to overcome the reasonable person's will to leave. For this reason, if
the  police  officer's  language  overcame  the  walker's  will  to  leave,  it
confined him.

A is incorrect because if it was reasonable for the walker to believe
that an attempt to leave would result in some harm to him, then he was
confined even though no physical barriers prevented him from getting
out  of  the  police  car.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  police  officer's
assertion of legal authority and threatening language would have made
any protest by the walker a futile — and thus unnecessary — gesture.
D  is  incorrect  because  damage  is  not  an  essential  element  of  false
imprisonment.

108.  B  A  defendant  owes  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  a  plaintiff  if  the
defendant's  conduct  creates  a  foreseeable  risk  to  that  plaintiff.  A
foreseeable  risk  is  a  danger  that  a  reasonable  person  would
anticipate.  If  the  driver's  conduct  created  no  foreseeable  risks  to
persons in the hospital, the driver did not owe such persons a duty of
reasonable care and could not be held liable to them for negligence.

is  so,  however,  only 

The intervening act of a third person may be a superseding cause of
harm,  relieving  the  original  wrongdoer  of  liability  for  the  plaintiff's
injuries.  This 
intervention  was
unforeseeable. A is incorrect because the negligence of a surgeon is
usually  regarded  as  foreseeable.  C  is  similarly  incorrect  because
even aggravated negligence may be foreseeable. Since any result may
have  several  causes,  the  fact  that  the  scars  were  caused  by  the
conduct  of  the  doctor  does  not  establish  that  they  were  not  also
caused by the negligence of the driver. D is therefore incorrect.

the 

if 

109.  B  There  can  be  no  liability  for  making  defamatory  statements  unless
those  statements  are  false.  Statements  that  are  expressions  of  the

1046

writer's  feelings  regarding  subjective  matters  are  statements  of
opinion, and opinions are neither true nor false. Since the quality of
the plaintiff's writing is a subjective matter, the defendant's statements
are  opinions.  Statements  of  opinion  can  be  defamatory  only  if  the
reasonable  person  would  interpret  the  statements  as  fact.  Here,  the
nature  of  the  defendant's  statements  makes  them  unlikely  to  be
interpreted as facts.

A media defendant may be held liable for defaming a public figure if
the defamatory statements were made with actual malice. A and C are
therefore  incorrect.  Although  a  businessperson  may  be  privileged  to
compete  by  making  unflattering  reference  to  his  or  her  competitor's
products,  D  is  incorrect  because  the  privilege  is  qualified  by  the
requirement of good faith.

110. A A professional supplier who sells a product in a defective condition
is  strictly  liable  for  harm  that  proximately  results  from  the  defect.
Here, since the jury found the machine was the proximate cause of the
employee's injury, the manufacturer is strictly liable for it.

B is incorrect because the manufacturer's liability would not be based
on  whether  it  was  reasonable  in  its  offers  to  make  a  repair.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  machine  was  defective  when  it  was  placed  in
the  stream  of  commerce,  and  nothing  happened  to  change  its
condition.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  unreasonable  conduct  of  an
intervenor  is  not  a  superseding  cause  of  harm  unless  it  is
unforeseeable.  Here,  an  owner  of  the  machine  not  wanting  to  pay
$1,000 for a repair is likely foreseeable.

111.  C  A  defendant  is  liable  only  for  harm  caused  by  his  or  her  conduct.
Conduct is a cause of harm only if the harm would not have occurred
without  that  conduct.  If  the  passenger's  harm  would  have  occurred
without  the  man's  conduct,  the  man's  conduct  could  not  have  been  a
cause of the passenger's harm.

Although  the  violation  of  a  statute  is  relevant  to  the  issue  of
negligence  if  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect  persons  like  the
plaintiff against risks like that which produced the plaintiff's harm, A
would not be an effective defense for two reasons. First, the fact that
the statute was designed to protect schoolchildren does not prove that
it  was  not  also  designed  to  protect  automobile  passengers.  Second,
even  if  the  statutory  violation  is  not  relevant  to  the  issue  of

1047

negligence, the passenger might succeed in establishing common law
negligence (i.e., that the man failed to act reasonably). An intervening
cause  of  harm  may  be  a  superseding  cause  that  shifts  responsibility
from the original wrongdoer to the intervenor, but only if the conduct
of the intervenor was unforeseeable. Since the negligence of motorists
is  a  common  occurrence,  the  woman's  negligence  was  probably
foreseeable. B and D are therefore incorrect.

112.  B  Since  the  two  defendants  were  found  to  be  jointly  and  severally
liable, the plaintiff can collect the entire amount of his judgment from
either  of  them  or  from  both  of  them  in  any  combination.  Under  the
pure  comparative  negligence  statute  that  existed  in  the  jurisdiction,
the  plaintiff's  judgment  should  be  for  the  amount  of  his  damages,
diminished in proportion to his own fault. Since the plaintiff's injury
was  found  to  have  resulted  20  percent  from  the  plaintiff's  own
negligence, his judgment should be for $100,000 less 20 percent, or
$80,000.

A is incorrect because it does not diminish the plaintiff's recovery in
proportion  to  his  fault.  C  is  incorrect  because  joint  tortfeasors  are
jointly  and  severally  liable.  In  an  all-or-nothing  contributory
negligence  jurisdiction,  a  plaintiff  who  was  contributorily  negligent
will  receive  nothing,  even  though  the  defendant  may  have  been
negligent  as  well.  Under  the  “pure  comparative  negligence”  statute
given,  however,  the  plaintiff's  recovery  is  not  completely  barred  by
his negligence. D is therefore incorrect.

113.  D  Vicarious  liability  only  occurs  when  there  is  an  employment
relationship (or, occasionally, an independent contractor relationship)
between  the  defendant  and  the  tortfeasor.  While  the  defendant  could
be liable for inadequate security or negligently allowing the tortfeasor
to come onto the premises, the defendant cannot be found liable under
the principle of vicarious liability for torts committed by a customer.
A  is  therefore  incorrect.  “General  liability”  is  not  a  principle  for
holding a party liable. B is therefore incorrect. Strict liability comes
into  play  with  defective  products,  keeping  wild  or  other  dangerous
animals,  or  carrying  out  abnormally  dangerous  activities.  Here,  the
question  involves  none  of  these  three  scenarios.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.

114. D Invasion of privacy by public disclosure of private facts consists of
publishing offensive and previously unknown facts about the plaintiff.

1048

The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held,  however,  that  First
Amendment guarantees of free expression prohibit imposing liability
for the publication of facts that are already matters of public record.
The  Court  said  that  this  rule  applies  even  to  facts  that  are  not
commonly known, since the press often serves as eyes and ears for a
public too busy to search public records for itself.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  for  the  above  reason.  B  is  also  incorrect
because a privilege to publish information about one who is involved
in a matter of public interest may exist even though that person is not a
public employee. C  is  incorrect  because  although  publication  of  the
truth  cannot  lead  to  liability  for  defamation,  publication  of  private
facts  that  are  not  newsworthy  may  result  in  liability  when  it  would
offend the reasonable person, even if those facts are true.

115. C  Trespass  to  land  consists  of  intentional  unauthorized  entry  on  realty
possessed by the plaintiff. There is no requirement of damage. Since
the landowner's complaint gave the factory knowledge that dust from
its operation was settling on the cabin, and since the factory thereafter
continued  operating  as  it  had  been,  the  necessary  intent  is  present
(i.e.,  the  factory  was  substantially  certain  that  entry  would  occur).
Some  cases  have  held  that  the  settling  of  dust  constitutes  a  tangible
entry on affected realty; other cases have held that it does not. For this
reason,  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  find  that  a  trespass
occurred.  Of  all  the  theories  listed,  however,  trespass  to  land  is  the
only one that might possibly result in a judgment for the landowner.

Invasion  of  privacy  by  intrusion  involves  an  interference  with  the
plaintiff's  interest  in  solitude  and  requires  some  kind  of  prying  into
the  plaintiff's  affairs  or  private  life.  This  did  not  occur  here.  Other
privacy  theories  —  appropriation,  public  disclosure,  false  light  —
are  not  even  remotely  applicable.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Unlike
trespass,  which  requires  no  damage,  nuisance  liability  is  imposed
only  where  the  plaintiff  has  sustained  some  substantial  harm.  An
individual may assert a public nuisance claim only if the harm that he
or she sustained differed from that sustained by the general public. B
is  incorrect  for  these  reasons.  An  abnormally  dangerous  activity  is
one  that  necessarily  involves  a  serious  risk  of  harm  that  cannot  be
eliminated  by  acting  reasonably.  Since  there  are  no  facts  indicating
that the use of unbagged cement is such an activity, D is incorrect.

116. D When tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable, a plaintiff is entitled

1049

to  collect  all  his  or  her  damages  from  any  one  of  them  (i.e.,
“severally”), or to collect his or her damages from them together (i.e.,
“jointly”)  in  any  combination  whatsoever.  Since  the  court  held  the
company,  the  employee,  and  the  driver  to  be  jointly  and  severally
liable  to  her,  the  passenger  is  entitled  to  collect  100  percent  of  her
damages from the employee if she chooses to do so.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect. (Note: Comparative negligence
statutes  determine  the  effect  of  the  plaintiff's  fault.  Since  the  jury
found the plaintiff to be free of fault, the existence of a comparative
negligence  statute 
law
contribution systems give joint tortfeasors certain rights against each
other, but do not affect a plaintiff's right to collect from them jointly
and/or severally.)

irrelevant.  Statutory  and  common 

is 

117. C That joint tortfeasors are “jointly and severally liable” means that the
plaintiff  may  collect  all  his  or  her  damages  from  either  of  them  or
from  both  of  them  in  any  combination.  Obviously,  however,  the  fact
that there are multiple tortfeasors does not entitle a plaintiff to collect
his or her damages more than once. Since the defendants were jointly
and  severally  liable  to  the  plaintiff  for  $100,000,  the  plaintiff  is
entitled  to  collect  $100,000  from  either  or  both  of  them  in  any
combination.  Since  the  plaintiff  has  already  received  $10,000  from
the  first  defendant,  she  is  entitled  to  collect  the  remaining  $90,000
from the second defendant.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  a  statute  basing  contribution  on
apportionment  of  fault  affects  the  rights  that  joint  tortfeasors  have
against  each  other,  but  it  does  not  affect  their  joint  and  several
liability  to  the  plaintiff.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff  has
already received $10,000 from the first defendant, and to allow her to
collect  an  additional  $100,000  from  the  second  defendant  would
result in her collecting her damages more than once.

118. B In jurisdictions that follow pure comparative negligence, the plaintiff's

Consequently,  the  $100,000  in  damages  was  75  percent  the  fault  of
the plaintiff, so he should only recover 25 percent of the damages, or
$25,000.

A  is  incorrect  because  in  a  pure  comparative  fault  jurisdiction,  the
fact  that  the  plaintiff  was  responsible  for  more  of  the  damages  does
not  relieve  the  defendant  from  liability.  C  is  incorrect,  because  the

1050

plaintiff would not be entitled to damages that could be attributed to
his negligence. D is incorrect, because the plaintiff's damages would
be reduced by the amount of his negligence.

threatened 

119. B Self-defense is a privilege to use reasonable force to protect oneself
against  a 
tortious  contact  or  confinement.  Some
jurisdictions hold that it is never reasonable to use deadly force when
it is reasonably safe to retreat. But even in those jurisdictions that do
not  require  retreat,  the  defendant's  privilege  is  likely  to  turn  on
whether he knew or should have known that he could safely retreat. In
connection  with  the  privilege  of  self-defense,  “reasonable  force”
means the force that would have appeared necessary to the reasonable
person  in  the  defendant's  situation.  If  the  defendant  knew  or  should
have known that he could safely and easily retreat without sustaining
harm, the reasonable person in his situation would probably not have
considered it necessary to use any force at all in self-defense. On the
other hand, if the defendant could not have known that he could safely
and  easily  retreat,  the  reasonable  person  in  his  situation  might  have
considered the use of a knife necessary because of the extreme danger
facing a person who has a pistol pointed at him.

Deadly force may be reasonable in self-defense if the person using it
is  being  threatened  by  what  reasonably  appears  to  be  deadly  force.
Since the plaintiff was threatening the defendant with a pistol, the use
of a knife — even if it was deadly force — may have been privileged
in  self-defense.  For  this  reason,  A  is  incorrect.  If  the  defendant
initiated the aggression by slapping the plaintiff, then the plaintiff was
privileged  to  use  reasonable  force  to  defend  himself  against  the
possibility of further blows by the defendant. Thus, if the force with
which the plaintiff threatened the defendant was reasonable, it would
have  been  privileged  and  therefore  not  tortious.  If  that  was  so,  then
the defendant would not have been privileged to use force to defend
himself against it. (This reasoning accounts for the rule that an initial
aggressor is not privileged to use force to defend himself or herself
against a reasonable response to his or her aggression.) If, however,
the plaintiff's use of a pistol was unreasonable (i.e., excessive force),
it  was  not  privileged  by  self-defense.  Then,  the  contact  with  which
the  plaintiff  threatened  the  defendant  would  have  been  tortious,  and
the defendant would have been privileged to defend himself against it
by using reasonable force. Thus, even if the defendant was the initial
aggressor,  he  might  have  been  privileged  to  use  a  knife  to  defend

1051

himself  against  the  plaintiff's  use  of  a  gun.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.
Since reasonable force depends on what the reasonable person in the
defendant's  situation  would  have  considered  necessary, 
the
defendant's  privilege  depends  on  how  the  defendant  perceived  or
should  have  perceived  the  threat  with  which  he  was  confronted.
Whether  or  not  the  plaintiff  knew  that  the  pistol  was  loaded,  the
defendant's  use  of  a  knife  might  have  been  reasonable  if  the
defendant  believed  that  the  pistol  was  loaded.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

120. D  A  person  who  keeps  a  wild  animal  is  strictly  liable  for  all  damage
done by that animal so long as that damage results from a dangerous
propensity that is typical of the animal's species. Importantly, the fact
that the average person fears a particular type of animal is part of that
animal's dangerous propensities. Here, although the lion may not have
harmed  the  plaintiff  in  any  way,  the  defendant  is  strictly  liable
because humans' fear of unrestrained lions is part of what makes lions
dangerous. Importantly, that fear caused the plaintiff to drop the pot of
grease  onto  her  foot.  C is  therefore  incorrect.  Whether  an  animal  is
known to be dangerous comes into play when determining liability for
domestic  animals.  A  lion  is  certainly  not  a  domestic  animal  (like  a
cat, dog, or hamster). A is therefore incorrect. Because the defendant
can be held strictly liable, the defendant's negligence is irrelevant. B
is therefore incorrect.

121. C The law of torts knows only three possible bases of liability: intent,
negligence,  and  strict  liability.  Since  intent  is  desire  or  knowledge
with  substantial  certainty  that  harm  will  occur,  and  since  the  store
owner did not desire or know that any person would be struck by the
door,  no  recovery  is  possible  on  an  intent  theory.  Although  strict
liability  is  imposed  on  the  sellers  of  defective  products,  strict
liability  is  not  available  against  the  store  owner  because  the  store
owner  did  not  sell  the  product  that  injured  the  customer.  The  only
remaining theory is negligence, which involves unreasonable conduct
in  the  face  of  a  duty  of  reasonable  care.  Since  the  customer  entered
the premises for the purpose of making a purchase, he is an invitee.
The duty owed to an invitee is to keep the premises reasonably safe
by making reasonable inspections and reasonable repairs. Thus, if a
reasonable  inspection  would  have  disclosed  the  problem,  then  the
store  owner  was  either  negligent  in  not  inspecting  or  negligent  in
failing  to  discover  what  a  reasonable  inspection  would  have

1052

disclosed.

A is incorrect because only a professional seller of products like the
one  that  caused  injury  can  be  held  strictly  liable  for  defects  in  that
product.  The  liability  of  a  defendant  does  not  depend  upon  the
availability of remedies against others. Thus, even if the fact that the
contractor  was  not  negligent  might  leave  the  customer  without  a
remedy,  it  would  not  affect  the  liability  of  the  store  owner.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  A  landholder  owes  an  invitee  a  duty  of
reasonable care to keep the premises reasonably safe, while he or she
owes  a  lesser  duty  to  licensees  and  trespassers.  For  this  reason,  it
might be relevant to determine whether the customer entered the store
owner's premises as an invitee. An invitee is one whose presence is
likely to confer an economic benefit on the landholder or one who has
entered the premises in response to a public invitation. Supermarkets
ordinarily  invite  the  public  (either  expressly  or  impliedly)  to  enter
their premises for the purpose of examining their wares. In addition,
the courts usually hold that a person who is likely to buy confers an
economic  benefit  by  entering  business  premises,  even  if  he  or  she
does not actually make a purchase while there. For these two reasons,
the customer was an invitee whether or not he made a purchase before
leaving. D is therefore incorrect.

122.  C  Battery  is  committed  by  intentionally  causing  harmful  or  offensive
contact  with  another  person.  Since  there  was  no  contact  with  the
plaintiff, he could not successfully maintain a battery claim.

A, B, and D are incorrect for the above reason.

123. B  False  imprisonment  is  committed  by  intentionally  confining  another
person.  For 
the
plaintiff's will to leave. If the ex-husband's father did not prevent the
plaintiff from leaving, he did not confine her and could not be liable
to her for false imprisonment.

this  purpose,  “confining”  means  overcoming 

A  is  incorrect  because  damage  is  not  an  essential  element  of  false
imprisonment.  Although  the  ex-husband's  father's  conduct  may  have
prevented the plaintiff from obtaining physical custody of her son, the
plaintiff cannot maintain an action for false imprisonment unless she
herself was confined. C and D are therefore incorrect.

124. A Since the facts do not indicate that the defendant intended contact with
the boy or harm of any kind to the plaintiff, the only claim that could

1053

possibly  succeed  against  him  would  be  one  founded  on  negligence.
Negligence  is  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  Generally,  a
defendant owes a duty of reasonable care to a plaintiff only if his or
her conduct created a risk to that plaintiff that was foreseeable to the
reasonable  person.  Thus,  if  the  reasonable  person  would  not  have
expected  (i.e.,  foreseen)  harm  to  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant  would
have  owed  her  no  duty  of  reasonable  care  and  could  not  be  held
liable  to  her  for  negligence.  Many  jurisdictions  apply  the  “zone  of
danger” rule, which holds that a plaintiff may not recover for mental
suffering  that  he  or  she  experienced  upon  seeing  another  person
sustain  a  physical  injury  unless  he  or  she  was  in  the  same  zone  of
physical  danger  as  the  injured  person.  In  those  jurisdictions,  the
plaintiff  could  not  succeed  against  the  defendant  even  if  the  harm  to
her  was  foreseeable.  A  is  correct,  however,  because  of  all  the
additional facts listed, it is the only one that could possibly result in a
judgment for the plaintiff.

B is incorrect because the doctrine of transferred intent applies only
when the defendant's intent was tortious to begin with. Since the facts
do not indicate that the defendant desired or knew with certainty that
his car would strike the boy, he had no tortious intent. C is incorrect
because there is no rule of tort law that transfers consequences that is
known  as  the  “doctrine  of  transferred  consequences.”  Liability  for
intentionally inflicting emotional distress requires outrageous conduct
by  the  defendant.  This  tort  also  requires  that  the  defendant  intend  to
cause mental suffering or be reckless in creating the risk of emotional
distress,  however.  Since  the  defendant  lacked  such  intent  (while  he
was  speeding,  “reckless”  requires  the  defendant  to  act  in  deliberate
disregard of a high degree of probability that emotional distress will
occur,  and  there  are  no  facts  indicating  this),  he  could  not  be  held
liable  for  intentionally  inflicting  mental  distress  even  if  his  conduct
was outrageous. D is therefore incorrect.

125.  C  Negligence  is  the  breach  of  a  duty  of  reasonable  care.  In  some
jurisdictions, the duty that a landholder owes to a plaintiff who enters
the  land  depends  on  the  plaintiff's  status  as  trespasser,  licensee,  or
invitee.  In  other  jurisdictions,  the  duty  does  not  depend  on  the
plaintiff's  status.  All  jurisdictions  agree,  however,  that  a  defendant
does not owe a plaintiff anything more than reasonable care, no matter
what the plaintiff's status. Since the lawn had recently been mowed,
and  since  the  ladder  was  in  plain  view,  it  probably  was  reasonable

1054

for  the  homeowner  to  believe  that  the  employee  saw  it.  If  so,  the
homeowner's  failure  to  warn  the  employee  about  it  probably  was
reasonable as well, and therefore probably was not negligent. While
it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  the
argument in C  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  support  the
homeowner's defense.

The  fact  that  the  homeowner  did  not  know  with  certainty  that  the
employee would be injured means that he did not intend her injury. A
is  incorrect,  however,  because  negligence  liability  does  not  require
intent or knowledge with certainty that harm will result. B is incorrect
because  a  landholder's  obligation  to  warn  or  protect  others  against
dangerous conditions of his or her land may extend to conditions that
he  or  she  did  not  create.  D  is  an  incorrect  statement  of  the  law;  in
general,  a  government  employee  entering  on  official  business  is  at
least a licensee, entitled to be warned of dangerous conditions known
to the landholder and hidden from the licensee's view.

126.  D  Under  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur,  an  inference  that  the
defendant acted unreasonably can be drawn if the injury involved was
one that does not usually occur without unreasonable conduct and the
defendant was the only person whose conduct could have caused the
injury (i.e., the defendant had exclusive control of the circumstances).
If  an  expert  witness  testifies  that  surgeons  do  not  usually  leave
instruments  inside  a  patient  unless  they  are  acting  unreasonably,  the
patient  can  rely  on  the  inference  established  by  res  ipsa  loquitur  if
she can show that the doctor was the only person who could have left
the instrument inside her. Since the doctor was the only person who
had  ever  performed  surgery  on  the  patient,  the  doctor  is  the  only
person who could have left the instrument inside her.

A is incorrect because it is based on an inaccurate statement of law;
there are many medical malpractice cases in which the plaintiff was
permitted  to  rely  on  res  ipsa  loquitur.  (Note:  These  frequently
involve  foreign  objects  that  were  left  in  the  plaintiff's  body  during
surgery). Ordinarily, in drawing an inference of negligence under the
doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur,  a  jury  relies  on  what  it  knows  about
human experience to determine whether a particular accident is of a
kind  that  does  not  usually  occur  without  negligence.  Because  of  its
lack  of  specialized  knowledge,  a  jury  is  not  competent  to  decide
whether  the  particular  result  of  a  professional's  conduct  is  one  that

1055

would  not  usually  occur  without  negligence.  Once  a  jury  has  heard
testimony to that effect from an expert witness, however, it may base
an  inference  of  negligence  on  its  decision  about  whether  or  not  it
believes  that  witness.  This  is  a  decision  that  a  jury  is  uniquely
competent  to  make.  For  this  reason,  B  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect
because  res  ipsa  loquitur  is  not  dependent  on  the  existence  of  any
“absolute duty,” but rather on circumstantial evidence that justifies the
inference that a particular defendant acted unreasonably.

127.  A  In  an  all-or-nothing  contributory  negligence  jurisdiction,  a  plaintiff
whose own negligence contributed to the accident cannot recover any
damages for injuries that he or she sustained. Under pure comparative
negligence  statutes,  a  plaintiff's  negligence  does  not  bar  his  or  her
recovery, but results in a reduction of damages in proportion to his or
her  own  fault.  Since  the  jury  found  the  pedestrian's  damage  to  be
$100,000  and  found  the  pedestrian  to  be  20  percent  at  fault,  the
pedestrian  is  entitled  to  collect  $100,000  reduced  by  20  percent.
When  two  defendants  are  “jointly  and  severally”  liable  to  the
plaintiff,  the  plaintiff  may  collect  the  entire  amount  of  his  or  her
judgment from either of them (several liability), or may collect it from
both of them in any combination whatsoever (joint liability). Since the
court  found  both  defendants  to  be  jointly  and  severally  liable  to  the
pedestrian, the pedestrian can collect the full amount of his judgment
from the first driver alone.

B is incorrect because of the “collateral source rule,” which provides
that money that a plaintiff receives from parties other than tortfeasors
or  their  representatives  is  irrelevant  in  determining  his  or  her
damages.  For  this  reason,  the  sum  of  $10,000  that  the  pedestrian
received  from  his  own  hospitalization  insurer  plays  no  part  in
determining the amount that he can collect from the defendants. C is
incorrect  because  the  court  found  the  defendants  to  be  jointly  and
severally liable to the pedestrian as explained above. D is incorrect
under the collateral source rule as explained above.

128. D A person is strictly liable for any damages that occur while he or she
is  conducting  an  abnormally  dangerous  activity.  An  activity  is
abnormally dangerous if there is a high degree of risk of some harm to
others, the harm that results is likely to be serious, the risk cannot be
eliminated  by  the  exercise  of  reasonable  care,  the  activity  is  not
common,  the  activity  is  not  appropriate  for  the  place  where  it  is

1056

carried  on,  and  the  danger  outweighs  the  activity's  value  to  the
community. There are some types of activities that are generally held
to be abnormally dangerous, such as the use or storage of explosives,
crop  dusting  or  spraying  with  pesticides,  and  the  operation  of  a
nuclear  reactor.  Here,  since  the  defendant  is  operating  a  nuclear
reactor, it is strictly liable for the harm done to the plaintiff. A and C
are  therefore  incorrect.  Ordinary  contributory  fault  will  not  usually
bar  a  plaintiff  from  recovery  under  strict  liability.  B  is  therefore
incorrect.

129. C Under the “but for” rule of causation, a defendant's conduct is a cause
of a plaintiff's injury if the plaintiff's injury would not have occurred
without it. Since the pedestrian would not have been injured without
the  girl's  intoxication,  and  since  the  girl  would  not  have  become
intoxicated  without  the  second  tavern's  conduct,  the  second  tavern's
conduct was a cause of the pedestrian's injury.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons.  First,  given  the  facts,  it  is  uncertain
whether the first tavern's conduct was a substantial factor in making
the  girl  intoxicated.  Second,  even  if  the  first  tavern's  conduct  was  a
cause  of  the  harm  (i.e.,  a  substantial  factor  in  producing  it),  the
second tavern's conduct was also a cause of that harm. B is incorrect
because the language  of  the  statute  (“.  .  .  any  person  who  sold  said
minor  the  alcohol  which  resulted  in  said  minor's  intoxication  .  .  .”)
indicates  that  liability  depends  on  a  causal  relationship  between  the
defendant's  conduct  and 
the
the  minor's 
pedestrian's  injury  would  not  have  occurred  without  the  girl's
intoxication, any cause of the girl's intoxication must also have been a
cause of the pedestrian's injury. D is therefore incorrect.

intoxication.  Since 

130. C Negligence is unreasonable conduct in the face of a foreseeable risk.
If  the  contractor  acted  reasonably  in  relying  on  the  architect's
instructions, she could not have been negligent.

A  plaintiff  may  be  prevented  from  recovering  for  damages  resulting
from  a  defendant's  negligence  if  the  plaintiff  “assumed  the  risk”  by
voluntarily  encountering  a  risk  of  which  he  or  she  knew.  A  is
incorrect  because  this  concept  applies  only  to  the  conduct  of  a
plaintiff.  B  is  incorrect  because  a  defendant  owes  a  duty  of
reasonable care to all persons who are placed at a foreseeable risk as
a result of that defendant's conduct. Since it was foreseeable that the
landowner would hire a mover to bring furniture into the new house,

1057

the  contractor  thus  owed  the  mover  a  duty  to  act  reasonably  in
building the house and could be liable to the mover for breaching it.
D is incorrect because a ritualistic protest is not sufficient to absolve
a person of liability for the results of his or her conduct if that conduct
is unreasonable.

131. C The manufacturer of a product is strictly liable for damage that results
from a defect in the product that existed at the time the manufacturer
placed that product in the stream of commerce. In this connection, a
product is defective if its condition would defeat the expectations of
the  reasonable  consumer.  Since  a  reasonable  consumer  would  not
expect liquor to contain poison, the liquor was defective. Since that
defect  existed  when  the  liquor  left  the  factory,  the  factory  is  strictly
liable for the pedestrian's injuries.

A  is  incorrect  because  strict  liability  is  imposed  regardless  of  the
reason  for  the  existence  of  the  defect.  B  is  incorrect  because  strict
liability  is  applied  for  the  benefit  of  any  foreseeable  plaintiff
regardless  of  whether  he  or  she  was  a  purchaser,  consumer,  or
bystander. D is incorrect because strict liability (i.e., liability without
fault) does not depend on the defendant's unreasonable conduct.

132. A  Strict  liability  (i.e.,  liability  without  fault)  may  be  imposed  on  one
who engages in an abnormally dangerous activity. In this connection,
an activity is sufficiently dangerous to result in strict liability if it is
not a common activity and necessarily involves a serious risk of harm
that cannot be eliminated by reasonable care. While it is not certain
that a court would come to this conclusion, A is the only option that
could possibly be correct.

Although the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur may permit an inference of
negligence  to  be  drawn  from  circumstantial  evidence,  it  does  not
impose  negligence  liability  on  a  defendant  who  was  not  negligent.
Since  the  facts  indicate  that  the  rocket  company  acted  reasonably,
negligence liability should not be imposed. B  is  therefore  incorrect.
Although  tort  liability  is  sometimes  limited  by  the  concept  of
foreseeability,  the  amount  of  damage  need  not  be  specifically
foreseeable  so  long  as  the  type  of  damage  is  foreseeable.  C  is
therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  a  type  of  harm  may  be
foreseeable  even  though  it  never  happened  before  (e.g.,  it  is
foreseeable  that  a  person  will  die  even  though  he  or  she  has  never
died before). The fact that no such damage had ever occurred in the

1058

past is therefore not sufficient to make that damage unforeseeable.

133. C A manufacturer is strictly liable for injuries that result from a defect
in its product if the defect existed when the manufacturer placed the
product in the stream of commerce. The company will thus be strictly
liable  if  the  absence  of  an  acceleration  suppressor  was  a  defect.  A
defect  is  a  condition  that  would  defeat  the  expectations  of  the
reasonable  consumer.  Unless  the  belt  truck  is  equipped  with  an
acceleration  suppressor,  it  will  lurch  forward  if  the  belt  idle  is
adjusted  improperly.  The  reasonable  consumer  probably  does  not
expect  a  vehicle  to  lurch  forward  when  it  is  being  used  for  its
intended purpose. Since persons who maintain belt trucks frequently
adjust the belt idle improperly, belt trucks will frequently lurch in the
absence  of  an  acceleration  suppressor.  Its  absence,  therefore,  is
probably a defect.

those  subsequent  acts  (i.e., 

The absence of an acceleration suppressor was a factual cause of the
employee's injury because the employee would not have been injured
if the truck had been equipped with one. The fact that the injury would
not  have  occurred  without  the  subsequent  acts  of  others  (i.e.,
intervening causes) would not prevent the company from being liable
intervening  causes)  were
unless 
unforeseeable (i.e., superseding causes). Since humans are frequently
negligent,  the  unreasonable  conduct  of  the  first  airline  and  the
contractor may have been foreseeable. For this reason, A and B are
incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  it  is  based  on  an  inaccurate
statement.  Sometimes  the  relationship  between  two  persons  makes
one of them responsible for conduct of the other (i.e., conduct of one
is  imputed  to  the  other).  There  is  no  relationship  between  the
contractor  and  the  company  that  would  result  in  such  an  imputation,
however.

134. D Private nuisance involves a tortious invasion of the plaintiff's right to
use  and  enjoy  realty.  Although  the  fumes  invaded  the  homeowner's
right  to  use  and  enjoy  his  realty,  their  emission  was  not  a  nuisance
unless it resulted from liability-forming (i.e., tortious) conduct by the
company.  Since  the  homeowner  has  alleged  that  the  company's
conduct  was  liability-forming  in  that  it  was  negligent,  liability  will
depend  on  whether  the  company's  conduct  was  unreasonable  (i.e.,
is
negligent).  Ordinarily, 
unreasonable,  it  is  necessary  to  weigh  the  risks  resulting  from  such
conduct  against  the  burdens  of  eliminating  those  risks.  Additionally,

in  determining  whether  conduct 

1059

courts  will  weigh  the  social  value  and  utility  of  the  defendant's
activity  against  the  harm  done  to  the  plaintiff.  Here,  the  company  is
making an insecticide that is very important to the state's orange crop,
and the plaintiff is having the paint on his home damaged. If the cost
(i.e.,  the  burden)  of  eliminating  the  fumes  would  drive  the  company
out  of  business,  a  court  might  find  that  the  burden  was  so  much
heavier  than  the  risk  that  it  would  eliminate  that  it  was  not
unreasonable for the company to continue emitting the fumes, and that
the company, therefore, was not negligent. While it is not certain that
a court would come to this conclusion, D is the only argument listed
that could possibly provide the company with an effective defense.

A  is  incorrect  because  nuisance  requires  an  invasion  of  plaintiff's
rights in realty, but it does not require a physical invasion of the realty
itself. For an individual to prevail in a claim for public nuisance, he
or  she  must  show  that  the  harm  that  he  or  she  sustained  was
substantially different from that sustained by the general public. B is
incorrect,  however,  because  no  such  showing  is  required  in  a  claim
for private nuisance. If the homeowner's claim were based on intent,
it would be necessary for him to show that the company knew that its
activity  was  interfering  with  his  right.  Since  his  claim  is  based  on
negligence,  however,  it  is  sufficient  for  him  to  show  that  such
interference was foreseeable. C is therefore incorrect.

135. C Strict liability in tort is imposed, regardless of fault, on a professional
supplier who sells a product while it is in a defective condition. If a
product  is  more  dangerous  than  would  be  contemplated  by  the
ordinary  consumer,  the  product  is  defectively  dangerous.  If  the
ordinary consumer would not have expected the product to irritate the
scalp  of  a  person  with  the  plaintiff's  allergy,  then  the  product's
condition  would  defeat  the  reasonable  expectation  of  the  ordinary
consumer and was defective.

Under  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur,  an  inference  of  negligence
can be drawn from the fact that a particular kind of accident does not
usually  occur  without  negligence.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because
the plaintiff's theory is strict liability in tort, and since strict liability
is imposed without regard to fault, an inference that the defendant was
negligent is not relevant to it. The facts in B and D would suggest that
the company knew or should have known about the plaintiff's allergy.
This  knowledge  is  not  sufficient,  however,  to  establish  that  the

1060

product's  condition  would  have  defeated  the  reasonable  expectation
of  the  ordinary  consumer  (i.e.,  that  the  product  was  defective).  For
this reason, B and D are incorrect.

136. D Negligence can be based on an unreasonable omission, so long as the
potentially negligent party had a duty to act. Generally, a person has a
duty to act only when his or her conduct causes a need for such action.
This can happen when a person's conduct causes a plaintiff to fail to
protect himself or herself against already existing risks because he or
she  reasonably  believes  that  the  person  would  protect  him  or  her.
Consequently,  since  the  defendant's  past  conduct  had  caused  the
plaintiff  to  reasonably  believe  there  would  be  no  leaves  on  the
sidewalk,  the  defendant  could  be  found  negligent  under  these
circumstances.  This  would  be  so  whether  or  not  the  danger  was
created by the defendant or located on his or her property. Therefore,
A and C are incorrect. B is incorrect because the plaintiff's potential
negligence would not necessarily insulate the defendant from liability.

137. A Res ipsa loquitur permits an inference of unreasonable conduct to be
drawn  where  the  accident  is  one  that  would  not  ordinarily  have
occurred  without  negligence,  and  the  defendant  was  in  exclusive
control of the circumstances that produced the harm. Since the bread
company  was  in  exclusive  control  of  the  baking  process,  res  ipsa
loquitur  would  apply  if  reasonable  care  in  baking  would  ordinarily
have eliminated the slivers (i.e., if the accident would not ordinarily
have occurred without negligence).

B  is  incorrect  because  liability  for  negligence  (which  is  the  only
theory  to  which  res  ipsa  loquitur  applies)  does  not  depend  on
whether a product is defective. The customer's harm  was  caused  by
the presence of the metal slivers in the bread. C is incorrect because
even if the farmer's negligence caused the slivers to be in the wheat,
the bread company may be liable for the harm if its negligence caused
them to be in the bread. If reasonable care would have prevented the
slivers from getting in the bread, it does not matter how they got into
the  wheat.  Thus,  even  if  the  breaking  of  the  farmer's  blade  was
unforeseeable, the bread company might be liable to the customer for
its  negligence  in  failing  to  keep  the  slivers  out  of  the  bread.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

138. C A defendant is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress if,
with  the  intent  to  cause  mental  distress,  he  or  she  engages  in

1061

outrageous conduct that causes severe mental distress. The defendant
intends  the  plaintiff's  mental  distress  if  he  or  she  desires  or  knows
that  it  will  result  from  his  or  her  conduct.  Because  of  the  affection
normally  associated  with  the  mother-daughter  relationship,  the
kidnapper probably intended that his threats to injure or kill the girl
would cause her mother to experience mental distress. If his conduct
was  outrageous  and  caused  her  to  experience  mental  distress,  the
kidnapper  is  liable  to  her  for  the  mental  distress  and  any  physical
manifestations of it.

A is incorrect because the passage of time is not sufficient to prevent
liability  for  an  injury  that  was  caused  by  the  defendant's  tortious
conduct.  If  the  reasonable  person  would  not  have  experienced  any
suffering  as  a  result  of  the  kidnapper's  conduct,  then  a  plaintiff  who
did  experience  suffering  might  not  be  permitted  to  recover  for  it
because the law does not seek to benefit a supersensitive plaintiff. If
the  reasonable  person  would  have  experienced  some  suffering,
however,  a  plaintiff  will  be  permitted  to  recover  for  his  or  her
suffering even if a preexisting condition makes it unusually severe. B
is therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because liability for intentional
infliction of mental distress requires intent, not merely a foreseeable
risk.

139.  C  Assumption  of  the  risk  is  a  defense  in  all  approaches  to  products
liability (although some jurisdictions have merged it with the concept
of  comparative  fault),  and  it  occurs  when  the  plaintiff  voluntarily
encounters a known risk. If the plaintiff knew that the paper suit was
likely  to  dissolve  when  wet  and  wore  it  anyway,  she  voluntarily
encountered (and therefore assumed) a known risk.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  department  store  may  be  held  liable
without fault for selling a defective product. B is incorrect because a
sign like the one described is not sufficient to apprise the buyer that
the product is being sold without any warranty of merchantability or
to prevent the reasonable consumer from expecting the bathing suit to
hold  together  when  wet.  Although  a  product  retailer  who  is  held
liable for selling a defective product has a right to be indemnified by
the product's manufacturer, the right of the injured plaintiff to recover
does not depend on this right of the retailer. D is therefore incorrect.

140.  B  Normally,  a  minor  child  is  held  to  the  same  standard  of  care  as  a
reasonable  child  of  similar  “age,  intelligence,  and  experience.”

1062

However, if the child engages in an adult activity, the child is held to
an adult standard of care. An adult activity is one normally undertaken
only  by  adults  and  for  which  adult  qualifications  are  required.
Driving a motorcycle is such an activity (usually, it requires a license
and has age restrictions). Consequently, the boy would be held to an
adult standard of care. According to the question, a reasonable adult
would have known to slow down, so the boy is liable for not adhering
to that standard.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  boy  is  not  automatically  liable  for  the
simple fact he is driving a motorcycle. C is incorrect because it states
the  wrong  standard  of  care.  D  is  incorrect  because  following  the
posted speed limit would not necessarily absolve him from liability.

141. B Negligence is a failure to act reasonably. Thus, if it was unreasonable
for the dog trainer to work the dog in her front yard, her conduct was
negligent  and  could  result  in  liability.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  a
court would come to this conclusion, the argument in B is the only one
listed that could possibly support the walker's claim.

Strict liability for damage resulting from a product defect is imposed
only  against  a  professional  supplier  who  placed  the  product  in  the
stream of commerce. Since the dog trainer was a user of the device
rather  than  a  supplier  of  it,  A  is  incorrect.  Conduct  that  causes
damage  can  result  in  tort  liability  only  if  the  damage  was  intended,
resulted from negligence, or resulted from an activity for which strict
liability  is  imposed.  Without  establishing  one  of  these  bases  of
liability, calling the dog trainer's conduct a cause of harm would not
be sufficient to result in liability. For this reason, the argument in C is
incomplete,  making  C  incorrect.  Although  some  special  standard  of
care might be imposed because of the dog trainer's profession, D  is
incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  that  the  standard  was
breached.

142.  D  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective  condition  when  sold.  If  the  presence  of  the  toxic  material
was a defect, the company would be strictly liable.

A is incorrect because strict liability is imposed regardless of fault or
knowledge by the defendant. Although the classification of a product
as  “inherently  dangerous”  was  significant  during  a  certain  historical
period  in  the  development  of  the  law  of  torts,  this  is  no  longer  the

1063

case. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because strict liability in
tort does not depend on the reasonableness of the defendant's conduct.

143.  A  A  person  whose  conduct  is  negligent  is  liable  for  damage  that  is
proximately caused by that negligence. Conduct is a proximate cause
of harm if it is a factual and legal cause of that harm. Thus, because
the  driver's  negligence  was  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  the
pedestrian's broken leg, the driver is liable for it.

B is incorrect because there was no relationship between the driver
and  the  taxi  that  would  result  in  such  an  imputation.  C  is  an
impossibility since nothing can be regarded as a legal cause of harm
unless  it  was  a  factual  cause  of  that  harm.  The  reasoning  of  D
establishes that the taxi's conduct was a cause of harm, but it does not
establish  that  the  other  driver's  conduct  was  not.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

144. D A statement is defamatory if it would tend to hold the plaintiff up to
shame,  disgrace,  or  ridicule  in  the  minds  of  a  substantial  group  of
respectable people. Since most respectable people believe that theft
is  disgraceful,  an  accusation  that  the  plaintiff  is  a  thief  is  probably
defamatory.

Because  the  employee  did  not  return  the  tools,  the  employer's
statement  is  literally  true.  However,  the  literal  truth  of  the  statement
would not prevent the employer from being liable since there is some
dispute as to whether the employee was justified in taking the tools. A
is  therefore  incorrect.  A  defendant  may  be  privileged  to  make
defamatory  statements  in  a  reasonable  and  good  faith  attempt  to
protect  a  legitimate  interest.  In  deciding  whether  a  former  employer
was  acting  in  good  faith  when  making  a  defamatory  statement  to  a
plaintiff's prospective employer, courts frequently look to whether the
former employer made the statement gratuitously (making it less likely
that he or she was acting in good faith) or in response to a request for
information (making it more likely that he or she was acting in good
faith). B is incorrect, however, because this fact alone is not sufficient
to  privilege  a  defendant's  publication.  C  is  incorrect  because  if  the
defendant was acting reasonably and in good faith, the interest that a
former  employer  has  in  common  with  a  prospective  employer  might
be sufficiently legitimate to make the privilege apply.

145.  C  While  a  defendant  can  be  held  strictly  liable  for  carrying  on  an

1064

abnormally  dangerous  activity  such  as  transporting  high  explosives,
the  defendant  is  only  strictly  liable  for  damage  that  results  from  the
kind  of  risk  that  made  the  activity  abnormally  dangerous.  While
transporting  high  explosives  may  be  abnormally  dangerous,  the
plaintiff's  injuries  did  not  result  from  the  kind  of  risk  that  made  this
activity  abnormally  dangerous  (namely  explosions).  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  assumption  of  the  risk  involves
situations where the plaintiff has voluntarily consented to take his or
her  chances  that  a  harm  will  occur.  This  usually  involves  situations
where the plaintiff is engaging in some type of activity, such as going
to a baseball game, bungee jumping, skiing, etc. Here, the plaintiff's
actions  were  more  correctly  categorized  as  contributory  negligence.
Importantly,  in  a  jurisdiction  that  follows  comparative  negligence
principles,  this  negligence  will  not  completely  bar  the  plaintiff's
recovery.  It  will  only  lessen  the  amount  recovered.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

146. D Negligence is the failure to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable
risk  created  by  the  defendant's  conduct.  Since  it  probably  was
foreseeable  that  the  used  car  dealer  would  show  a  customer  the  car
after  buying  it  for  resale,  the  seller  owed  such  customers  a  duty  of
reasonable care that probably was breached by his failure to disclose
the  crack.  Although  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this
conclusion, D is the only argument listed that could possibly lead to
recovery by the customer.

Battery  is  committed  by  intentionally  causing  a  harmful  or  offensive
contact  with  the  plaintiff.  In  a  battery  case,  intent  means  a  desire  or
knowledge  that  there  will  be  harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  the
plaintiff  or  that  the  plaintiff  will  become  apprehensive  of  such
contact. Although the seller knew that the engine was cracked, there is
no  indication  that  he  desired  or  knew  that  the  crack  would  result  in
harmful or offensive contact with any person, or that it would cause
apprehension  of  such  contact.  Although  these  risks  may  have  been
foreseeable,  battery  liability  cannot  be  imposed  without  intent.  For
this  reason,  A  is  incorrect.  Misrepresentation  liability  is  imposed
only  for  the  benefit  of  a  plaintiff  who  justifiably  relied  on  the
defendant's  false  representation.  Since  the  customer  did  not  rely  on
any  express  or  implied  statement  made  by  the  seller,  B  and  C  are
incorrect.

1065

147.  A  When  a  defendant  negligently  causes  physical  injury  or  property
damage to one party, but only pure economic loss to the plaintiff, the
traditional rule is that the plaintiff may not recover anything. This is
because  a  defendant  could  have  open-ended  liability  (for  example,
the restaurant's suppliers could sue, other waiters, etc.). Some courts
recognize  case-by-case  exceptions  to  this  rule,  but  only  in  cases
where the injury to the plaintiff was relatively foreseeable, relatively
few plaintiffs would be permitted to sue, and the defendant's conduct
was  relatively  blameworthy.  As  stated  above,  if  plaintiffs  are
allowed  to  sue  for  pure  economic  loss  in  this  case,  there  is  a
potentially  limitless  number  of  plaintiffs.  C  and  D  are  therefore
incorrect.  Because  the  defendant  would  be  liable  in  certain
exceptional cases, B is incorrect.

148.  B  A  private  individual  can  successfully  assert  a  claim  for  public
nuisance only if the harm that he or she sustained was different from
that sustained by the general public (i.e., “particular” harm). Since no
fact  indicates  this  to  be  so  of  the  resident,  she  may  not  assert  the
public nuisance claim.

A is incorrect because if the resident had sustained “particular” harm,
the decision of the city attorney would not prevent her from suing for
damages. Although it is generally held that a private individual may
not  seek  an  injunction  on  a  public  nuisance  theory,  C  is  incorrect
because  there  are  other  theories  on  which  a  private  individual  may
receive an injunction against environmental polluters. D is incorrect
because a private individual who sustains particular harm as result of
a public nuisance may sue for damages.

149.  D  It  is  given  that  the  doctor's  conduct  was  negligent.  Even  if  a
defendant's  conduct  was  negligent,  however,  the  defendant  is  not
liable for the plaintiff's injuries unless they were proximately caused
by  that  conduct.  Conduct  is  a  proximate  cause  of  an  injury  if  it  is  a
factual  and  legal  cause  of  the  injury.  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of
injury  if  the  injury  would  not  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  the
trucker would not have been in the hospital and injured by the falling
of the hospital structure except for the doctor's conduct, the doctor's
conduct was a factual cause of the trucker's injury. If conduct was a
factual  cause  of  harm,  it  was  a  legal  cause  of  that  harm  if  the  harm
was  foreseeable  and  not  brought  about  by  superseding  causes.  A
is
superseding  cause  of  harm 

intervening  cause 

is  an 

that 

1066

unforeseeable  or  independent  of  the  risks  created  by  the  defendant's
conduct. Thus, because the earthquake was a superseding cause of the
trucker's  fractured  skull,  it  prevented  the  doctor's  negligence  from
being a legal or proximate cause of the fractured skull.

A  establishes  that  the  doctor's  conduct  was  a  factual  cause  of  the
fractured  skull,  but  it  is  incorrect  because  it  does  not  deal  with  the
problem of legal cause. The doctor's conduct was not a legal cause of
the fractured skull unless the fractured skull was a foreseeable result
of  it.  The  fact  that  the  wait  might  have  been  foreseeable  does  not
make  the  fractured  skull  foreseeable.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C
establishes that the presence of the cherry pit was a factual cause of
the trucker's injury, but it does not establish that the doctor's conduct
was not also a cause of it. C is therefore incorrect.

150. D The statute given is typical of the “modified” comparative negligence
approach. A deduction is made from the plaintiff's recovery based on
the percentage of fault which was the plaintiff's. But if the plaintiff's
fault exceeds the defendant's, the plaintiff receives nothing. Since the
jury  found  the  plaintiff  to  be  60  percent  at  fault,  he  can  recover
nothing. A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

151. C Even if a defendant's conduct is negligent, the defendant is not liable
for the plaintiff's injuries unless they were proximately caused by that
conduct. Conduct is a proximate cause of harm if it was a factual and
legal cause of the harm. Conduct is a factual cause of harm if the harm
would not have occurred without it. Since the client would not have
been hurt if the landlord had fixed or warned him about the elevator,
the  landlord's  failure  to  do  so  was  a  factual  cause  of  the  client's
injuries. Conduct that is a factual cause of harm is a legal cause if the
harm  was  a  foreseeable  result  of  it  and  not  brought  about  by  an
unforeseeable intervening cause (i.e., a superseding cause). Since the
client would not have been hurt if the attorney had not permitted him
to  use  the  elevator,  the  attorney's  conduct  was  also  a  cause  of  the
client's injury. Thus, if it was not foreseeable that the attorney would
permit  the  client  to  use  the  elevator,  the  attorney's  conduct  was  a
superseding cause of the client's injury. While it is not certain that a
court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  C  is  the  only  argument  listed
that could possibly support the landlord's defense.

Although  the  landlord's  promise  to  repair  the  elevator  might  not  be
enforceable  by  the  client,  A  is  not  an  effective  argument  because,

1067

apart  from  the  promise,  one  who  holds  realty  owes  a  duty  of
reasonable  care  to  invitees.  An  invitee  is  a  person  whose  presence
confers  an  economic  benefit  on  the  landholder.  The  client  was  the
attorney's client, and the attorney would not have rented space in the
building  unless  his  clients  could  come  to  see  him  there.  For  this
reason,  the  client's  presence  did  confer  an  economic  benefit  on  the
landlord, and the client was the landlord's invitee. (Note: It is usually
held that invitees of a tenant are also invitees of the landlord.) B  is
therefore incorrect. Although an unforeseeable intervening cause may
be  superseding  (i.e.,  prevent  the  antecedent  wrongdoer  from  being
liable), the fact that it was unreasonable is not sufficient to make it
superseding. D is therefore incorrect.

152. A If the harm to the daughter was foreseeable, then the exterminator had
a duty to act reasonably in the face of it. His failure to do so would
constitute  negligence,  for  which  he  may  be  liable  to  the  daughter.
Although a court might not come to this conclusion, the argument in A
is the only one listed that could possibly support the daughter's claim.

Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  defective  product,  but
since  the  store  owner  did  not  sell  the  pellets  to  the  janitor,  B  is
incorrect.  Courts  impose  a  duty  to  act  reasonably  in  designing  or
producing  a  product  on  the  manufacturers  of  all  products.  For  this
reason, the question of whether a product is inherently dangerous is of
no  importance,  and  C  is  incorrect.  Unless  the  exterminator  was
negligent,  questions  of  causation  are  irrelevant.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

153. A Consent (i.e., willingness) is a defense to all intentional torts. While
it is not likely that this inference would be drawn, it would give the
girlfriend a complete privilege if it was.

B is incorrect because the plaintiff has a right to elect whether to sue
for  conversion  or  trespass  to  chattel.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
neighbor's liability would not prevent the girlfriend from being liable
as  well.  The  remedy  for  trespass  to  chattel  is  money  damages.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

154.  D  Negligence  means  failing  to  act  like  the  reasonable  person.  If  the
defendant  can  convince  the  trier  of  fact  that  the  reasonable  person
occasionally takes his or her eyes off the road while driving, and that
his  conduct  was  therefore  not  negligent,  the  plaintiff's  negligence

1068

action  against  him  will  fail.  While  a  court  might  not  come  to  this
conclusion, D is the only argument listed that might be effective in the
defendant's defense.

A  is  incorrect  because  assumption  of  the  risk  requires  a  voluntary
encounter  with  a  known  risk.  For  this  purpose,  a  risk  is  “known”  if
the  plaintiff  is  substantially  certain  that  harm  will  probably  occur.
Recognition  of  a  mere  possibility  of  harm  is  not  sufficient.  B  is
incorrect  because  although  it  establishes  that  the  other  car's  sudden
stop  was  a  cause  of  the  accident,  that  does  not  mean  that  the
defendant's  conduct  was  not  also  a  cause.  C  is  incorrect  since  the
special rules about duties owed to licensees apply only to accidents
that occur on a defendant's land.

155. A It was probably unreasonable for the fire chief (who knew the device
could  be  dangerous)  to  permit  the  volunteer  firefighter  (whom  he
knew to be untrained) to use it. Although a court might not find that the
fire chief was negligent, A is the only theory listed that could result in
a judgment for the woman.

Unless  the  fire  chief  had  a  substantial  certainty  that  harm  would
result,  he  lacked  the  intent  to  make  him  liable  for  battery.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  Strict  products  liability  is  imposed  only  on  a
professional supplier of a defective product. Since the fire chief was
not  in  the  business  of  supplying  the  device,  C  is  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  res ipsa  permits  an  inference  of  negligence  to  be
drawn from the circumstances only when there is no direct evidence
of the defendant's conduct.

156. C A defendant is liable for damage that was proximately caused by his
or her negligence. A defendant's conduct is a proximate cause of harm
if  it  is  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  that  harm.  Conduct  is  a  factual
cause of harm if the harm would not have occurred without it. Since
the  plaintiff  would  not  have  sustained  any  injuries  at  all  were  it  not
for  her  neighbor's  negligence,  her  neighbor's  negligence  is  a  factual
cause of all her injuries. Conduct that is a factual cause of harm is a
legal cause of that harm if the harm was foreseeable and not brought
about  by  unforeseeable  or  independent  interventions.  Courts  usually
hold that in treating injuries inflicted by a defendant, the malpractice
of a physician is neither unforeseeable nor independent of the conduct
that  caused  the  initial  injuries.  For  this  reason,  all  complications
caused by the malpractice of the doctors were proximately caused by

1069

the  neighbor,  making  the  neighbor  liable  for  them.  C  is  therefore
correct. (Note: The negligent doctors may also be held liable as joint
tortfeasors.)

157. D  A  statement  is  defamatory  if  it  would  expose  the  plaintiff  to  hatred,
contempt,  disgrace,  or  ridicule.  Here,  if  many  people  continue  to
believe that members of the group engage in improper activities, the
statement would do so.

A is incorrect since a judgment for the minister will not violate either
the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause. B is incorrect
because  what  matters  is  what  a  substantial  group  of  people  would
believe about the plaintiff as a result of the statement. The fact that a
substantial  group  of  right-thinking  people  would  not  associate  the
plaintiff with shame or disgrace does not prevent the statement from
being  defamatory  if  there  is  also  a  substantial  group  of  people  who
would. C is therefore incorrect.

158. D Negligence is the failure to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable
risk.  If  the  risk  was  not  foreseeable,  the  company's  failure  to  guard
against it was not negligence.

A is incorrect since an expert is expected to know only that which the
reasonable  expert  would  know.  If  the  risk  that  it  will  wear  out  was
not foreseeable, knowledge that harm would occur if it did wear out
does  not  result  in  a  duty  to  protect  against  its  wearing  out.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  employee's  action  is
based on negligence.

159. A  Negligence  is  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  Most  cases
hold that a defendant does not owe a duty of reasonable care unless it
is foreseeable (i.e., the reasonable person would anticipate) that his
or her act will cause harm. If it was reasonable for the carpenter to
believe  that  his  act  would  cause  no  harm,  he  owed  no  duty  of
reasonable care. If the carpenter owed no duty of reasonable care, the
carpenter could not have been negligent.

B  is  incorrect  because  custom  does  not  determine  what  reasonable
care is. Although the man's contributory negligence might prevent him
from recovering, there is no indication that the man's failure to see the
hammer  was  negligent.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because  of  the  rule  that  a  defendant  takes  the  plaintiff  as  he  or  she
finds  him  or  her.  (Note:  What  this  means  is  that  if  an  injury  to  the

1070

plaintiff  is  foreseeable,  the  full  extent  of  that  injury  is  foreseeable
even  though  some  special  sensitivity  of  the  plaintiff  was  a
contributing factor to its extent.)

160. C Negligence consists of a failure to act reasonably. Since the question
specifies  an  action  for  negligence,  the  man  cannot  win  without
establishing  that  the  grocery  store  was  negligent  (i.e.,  acted
unreasonably).

A is incorrect because it is based on an inaccurate statement of law:
The  negligence  of  a  manufacturer  is  not  ordinarily  imputed  to  a
retailer selling products made by that manufacturer, although a retailer
may  be  held  strictly  liable  for  damages  resulting  from  a  defect  that
existed  when  the  product  was  sold  by  that  retailer.  B  is  incorrect
because  negligence  liability  is  not  imposed  unless  the  defendant
acted  unreasonably.  D  is  incorrect  because  it  is  based  on  an
inaccurate  statement  of  law;  a  retailer  owes  its  customers  a  duty  of
acting  reasonably,  which,  depending  on  the  circumstances,  may
require the inspection of products packaged in sealed containers.

161. C  Negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct.  Thus,  if  the  driver  was  acting
unreasonably,  he  was  negligent  and  should  be  liable  for  the  boy's
injuries.  Under  the  all-or-nothing  rule  of  contributory  negligence,
however, a plaintiff is completely barred from recovery if his or her
own  negligence  contributed  to  the  happening  of  the  accident.
Contributory negligence is unreasonable conduct by a plaintiff. Thus,
if  the  boy's  injury  resulted  from  his  own  unreasonable  conduct  (i.e.,
contributory negligence), he will not recover in spite of the fact that
the driver was also negligent.

A  child  is  said  to  have  been  negligent  if  he  failed  to  act  like  a
reasonable child of the same age, experience, and intelligence. A  is
therefore  incorrect.  Res  ipsa  loquitur  permits  an  inference  that  the
defendant  was  negligent  to  be  drawn  from  certain  circumstantial
evidence. Since the driver's negligence is given, res ipsa loquitur is
inapplicable,  and  B  is  incorrect.  Unreasonable  conduct  by  a  third
person  is  not  imputed  to  a  plaintiff  as  contributory  negligence,  even
when  the  third  person  is  the  minor  plaintiff's  parent.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

162. B A defendant's conduct is a proximate cause of harm if it was a factual
and legal cause of that harm. Conduct is a factual cause of harm if the

1071

harm would not have occurred without it. Since the woman would not
have been injured by the bottle if the grocery store had not restacked
and sold the bottles, the grocery store's conduct was a factual cause of
the woman's injury. Conduct that is a factual cause of harm is a legal
cause of that harm if the harm was a foreseeable result of it. Since the
contents  of  bottles  of  soda-pop  are  under  pressure,  it  is  probably
foreseeable that a crack in the bottle will result in an explosion and
injury. The grocery store's conduct was thus a proximate cause of the
woman's injury. A defendant is liable for the proximate results of his
or  her  negligence.  For  this  reason,  since  the  grocery  store's  conduct
was negligent, the woman is likely to win her lawsuit against it.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff's  helplessness  is  not  in  itself  a
basis  of  the  defendant's  liability.  C  is  incorrect  because  harm  may
have more than one proximate cause. The fact that the conduct of the
officers was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm does not mean
that the negligence of the grocery store was not. Since privity is not an
essential element of a negligence action, D is also incorrect.

163. D Since the buyer received something for his money, the measure of his
damages  must  consider  the  value  that  he  has  received.  In  some
jurisdictions,  damage  for  misrepresentation  is  measured  by  the
difference between what the plaintiff received and what the defendant
told him or her he or she would be receiving (“benefit of the bargain”
theory). In this case, that would be $250,000 less $600, or $249,400.
In  other  jurisdictions,  the  damage  is  measured  by  the  difference
between what the plaintiff paid and what he or she actually received
(“out-of-pocket”  theory).  In  this  case,  that  would  be  $225,000  less
$600 or $224,400. D is therefore correct.

A and C are incorrect because they ignore the value of what the buyer
actually  received.  B  is  incorrect  because  it  describes  a  rescission
remedy, which may be available in a claim for breach of contract but
is not available in this tort claim for damages.

164. A  If  the  likelihood  of  injury  is  great,  a  defendant  may  be  required  to
anticipate the negligence of others. Here, a reasonable person would
not  have  lent  the  car  to  the  friend,  considering  the  fact  he  had  his
license revoked for reckless driving.

B is incorrect because the man's liability in this instance is based on
his loan of the car, not his ownership of it. C is incorrect because the

1072

man was negligent when he lent the car to his friend, so the fact the
friend lied to him about his intentions does not change the analysis. D
is  incorrect  because  the  woman's  motivation  for  suing  the  man  does
not affect the man's liability for negligence.

165. A  The  term  merchantable  means  “fit  for  ordinary  use.”  Proof  that  the
plaintiff's  allergic  reaction  was  the  only  one  that  ever  occurred
indicates  that  it  was  an  unusual  one.  If  the  plaintiff's  allergy  was
unusual enough to be regarded as extraordinary, the product may have
been fit for ordinary use (i.e., by ordinary persons) although unfit for
use by the plaintiff. While a court might not come to this conclusion,
A  is  the  only  fact  listed  that  could  possibly  support  the  defendant's
defense.

Most  jurisdictions  hold  all  members  of  the  chain  of  commercial
product distribution liable for a condition of the product that breaches
the  implied  warranty  of  merchantability.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.
Although  reasonable  inspection  may  have  revealed  that  the  product
was  safe  for  persons  with  “normal”  skin,  C  is  incorrect  for  two
reasons.  First,  warranty  liability  does  not  depend  on  unreasonable
conduct  by  the  defendant,  and  second,  ordinary  use  may  include  use
by  persons  with  skin  that  is  not  normal.  D  is  incorrect  because
government  approval  or  compliance  with  government  requirements
does not prevent common law liability.

166. C For the violation of a statute to constitute negligence per se, the type
of harm that occurred must be the type of harm the statute intended to
protect against. Here, the purpose of the statute was to protect people
from  falling  debris,  not  poisoning,  so  the  construction  company's
violation of it would not constitute negligence per se in this instance.
Therefore, A is incorrect.

B  and  D  are  incorrect  because  issues  of  control  or  the  child's
negligence would not change the initial negligence per se analysis.

167.  D  Defamation  is  a  tort  that  protects  a  person's  interest  in  their
reputation.  It  is  split  into  two  sub-torts,  libel  and  slander.  Libel
consists  mainly  of  all  written  and  printed  matter,  while  slander
involves  oral  statements.  To  establish  a  prima  facie  case  for  either
libel  or  slander,  the  plaintiff  must  prove  there  was  a  false  and
defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff, a communication of that
statement to some person other than the plaintiff, fault on the part of

1073

the  defendant,  and  either  special  harm  or  other  actionability.
Importantly,  the  communication  of  the  statement  has  to  be  either
intentional  or  negligent.  There  is  no  strict  liability.  Here,  since  the
defendant was not negligent in making the statement and did not intend
for others to hear it, he is not liable for either form of defamation. A,
B, and C are therefore incorrect.

168. B Under the given “pure comparative negligence” statute, the plaintiff's
damage should be diminished by 20 percent, since 20 percent of his
injury resulted from his own negligence. Under the collateral source
rule,  applied  in  most  jurisdictions,  money  that  the  plaintiff  has
received from collateral sources (i.e., those other than tortfeasors) is
not relevant to his or her rights against tortfeasors who caused his or
her injury. The insurance money that the plaintiff received was from a
collateral  source  and  should  therefore  not  play  any  role  in
determining the damages.

A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

169.  D  Contributory  negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct  by  the  plaintiff
without  which  his  or  her  injury  would  not  have  occurred.  Since  the
man would not have been injured if he had not accepted a ride from
his neighbor, and since doing so was obviously unreasonable, the man
was contributorily negligent. Assumption of the risk occurs when the
plaintiff voluntarily encounters a known risk. Since the man knew that
his  neighbor  was  drunk  and  voluntarily  rode  with  him,  the  man
assumed all the risks that normally accompany riding in a car driven
by a person who is drunk. Both of these would be effective arguments
in the neighbor's defense.

170. A Tortious appropriation of identity is committed by making commercial
use  of  the  plaintiff's  name,  likeness,  or  identity  without  his  or  her
permission.  It  has  been  repeatedly  held,  however,  that  newsworthy
publications about the plaintiff do not constitute commercial use and
therefore cannot result in liability for this tort. It has also been held
that information may be regarded as “newsworthy” for this purpose,
even though the group to which it is of interest is a limited one.

Since the use of a non-celebrity's identity might be put to commercial
gain (e.g.,  the  photograph  of  an  unknown  but  muscular  person  in  an
advertisement  for  exercise  equipment),  it  is  not  necessary  that  the
plaintiff be a public figure. Many of the cases imposing liability for
this  tort  have  involved  plaintiffs  who  were  not  celebrities.  B  is

1074

incorrect  for  this  reason  and  because  every  article  of  interest  to  a
publication's readers enriches the publisher by increasing the demand
for its product. Although the publication of facts that are contained in
public records is protected by the First Amendment, the commercial
use of such information is not necessarily protected. For this reason,
although C  would  be  an  effective  defense  against  a  claim  of  public
disclosure, it is not necessarily an effective defense against a claim of
appropriation.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  indicated  that
liability for false light privacy invasions cannot be imposed without a
showing of actual malice, but no such requirement exists for the tort
of appropriation. D is therefore incorrect.

171.  D  Damage  is  an  essential  element  of  a  negligence  action.  There  are
circumstances  under  which  a  plaintiff's  mental  suffering,  although
unrelated  to  physical  injury,  may  be  regarded  as  damage.  Mere
annoyance,  however,  is  probably  not  damage  sufficient  to  justify
recovery  for  negligence.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  this  argument
would defeat the claim of the landowner, D is the only argument listed
that could possibly lead to a judgment for the factory.

The reasonableness of a defendant's conduct is ordinarily determined
by weighing the risks that it creates against the benefits that it confers.
The  argument  set  forth  in  A  is  not  an  effective  defense,  however,
because  it  considers  only  the  benefit  resulting  from  the  use  of
unbagged concrete without balancing it against the resulting risks. A
is  therefore  incorrect.  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  any  result  that
would  not  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  the  landowner  would  not
have  experienced  annoyance  if  the  factory  had  not  used  unbagged
cement,  the  use  of  unbagged  cement  was  a  factual  cause  of  the
landowner's annoyance. B is therefore incorrect. A plaintiff assumes a
risk  when  he  or  she  knows  of  it  and  voluntarily  encounters  it.  C  is
incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  that  the  landowner's
encounter with the dust was voluntary.

172.  D  Although  the  plaintiff  can  still  collect  her  judgment  from  either  of
them or from both of them in any combination, as between themselves,
the defendants' contributive shares will be in proportion to their fault.
Thus,  the  plaintiff  could  collect  $100,000  from  the  first  defendant.
After  paying  this  sum,  however,  the  first  defendant  is  entitled  to
contribution from the second defendant in a sum proportionate to the
second defendant's fault. Since the second defendant was 60 percent

1075

at fault, the first defendant is entitled to collect 60 percent of what he
paid, or $60,000.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  jurisdiction  recognizes  a  right  of
contribution. B  is  incorrect  because  the  court  found  that  the  second
defendant  was  60  percent  at  fault.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  given
statute based contribution on apportionment of fault.

173. D The doctrine of respondeat superior makes an employer vicariously
liable to a plaintiff for torts committed by an employee acting within
the scope of employment. But the concept of indemnity may shift the
burden of payment from the one who actually did pay to the one who
should have paid. Therefore, an employer who has been required to
pay  for  a  tort  committed  by  an  employee  is  entitled  to  complete
indemnity (i.e., repayment) from the employee.

The  concept  of  vicarious  liability  determines  a  plaintiff's  rights
against a tortfeasor's employer, but it does not determine the rights of
that  employer  against  its  employee.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  When
parties are found to be jointly and severally liable to a plaintiff, the
plaintiff may collect all of his or her damages from any one of them or
from all of them in any combination whatsoever. For this reason, one
of the joint tortfeasors may be required to pay more than its fair share
of the plaintiff's damages. After this happens, most jurisdictions allow
the one who has paid to seek partial repayment from the others so that
each ends up paying a fair share. The majority of jurisdictions apply
the  equal  apportionment  approach,  determining  fair  shares  by
dividing the amount paid by the number of joint tortfeasors (treating
an  employee  and  employer  who  is  vicariously  liable  for  his  or  her
tort  as  a  single  unit  for  this  purpose).  In  these  jurisdictions,  joint
tortfeasors  who  pay  more  than  their  fair  share  are  said  to  seek
“contribution.”  Other  jurisdictions  apply  the  apportionment  of  fault
approach, basing the determination of fair shares on the relative fault
of  the  joint  tortfeasors.  In  these  jurisdictions,  joint  tortfeasors  who
pay more than their fair share are said to seek “partial indemnity.” B
and  C  are  both  incorrect,  however,  because  all  jurisdictions
recognize that a party who pays only because he or she is vicariously
liable for the tort committed by another person is entitled to complete
indemnity from that person.

174. A One who is negligent is liable for all harm proximately caused by that
negligence.  Negligence  is  a  proximate  cause  of  harm  if  that

1076

negligence  was  a  factual  cause  of  the  harm  and  if  the  harm  was  a
foreseeable consequence of the negligence. Since the biker's right leg
would not have been broken without the second driver's negligence,
and since a broken leg is a foreseeable consequence of being run over
by a car, the second driver's negligence was a proximate cause of the
biker's  broken  right  leg.  However,  since  the  biker's  left  leg  would
have been broken without the second driver's negligence, the second
driver's  negligence  was  not  a  factual  cause  of  it,  and  the  second
driver cannot be held liable for it.

175. C A defendant's conduct is a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm if it
was both a factual and legal cause of that harm. Conduct is a factual
cause of harm if the harm would not have occurred without it. Since
the truck would not have leaked gas if it had not been parked in front
of the builder's construction site where it was struck by falling debris,
the driver's parking it there was a factual cause of the woman's harm.
Conduct is a legal cause of harm if the harm was a foreseeable result
of  it  and  was  not  brought  about  by  an  unforeseeable  intervention.
Since the explosion would not have occurred if debris had not fallen
onto  the  truck  after  the  driver  parked  it,  the  falling  debris  was  an
intervening cause of the woman's harm. If that intervening cause was
foreseeable, however, the driver's conduct could still be regarded as
a legal cause of the explosion. On the other hand, if the intervention of
the falling debris was unforeseeable, the driver's conduct would not
be regarded as a legal cause of the explosion, and the driver could not
be held liable for the resulting damage. Whether the driver could have
anticipated  that  debris  would  fall  and  damage  the  truck  cannot  be
determined from the facts, but C is the only argument listed that could
possibly be effective in the driver's defense.

A  superseding  cause  of  harm  is  an  unforeseeable  intervening  cause.
An intervening cause is something that happened after the defendant's
conduct,  and  without  which  the  accident  would  not  have  occurred.
Although  the  builder's  use  of  poor-quality  steel  was  a  cause  of  the
woman's injury (because the injury would not have occurred without
it), it preceded the driver's conduct and thus was not an intervening
cause. It could not, therefore, have been a superseding cause. For this
reason,  A  is  incorrect.  The  fact  that  the  explosion  would  not  have
occurred  if  the  man  had  not  thrown  a  lit  cigarette  into  the  street
proves that the man's conduct was a cause of the woman's harm. The
fact  that  the  man's  act  occurred  after  the  driver's  conduct  makes  the

1077

man's  act  an  intervening  cause.  B  is  incorrect,  however,  because
unless  its  occurrence  was  unforeseeable,  the  fact  that  there  was  an
intervening cause is not sufficient to prevent the driver's conduct from
being a proximate cause of the woman's injury. Since any result may
have  several  proximate  causes,  it  is  never  correct  to  conclude  that
one thing was not a proximate cause because another thing was. D is
incorrect because the driver's conduct and the earthquake could both
have been proximate causes of the woman's injury.

176. A Although the manufacturer of a defective product may be held liable
without  fault  to  a  person  injured,  it  is  necessary  for  the  plaintiff  to
show that his or her injury was proximately caused by the product's
defect. If there was a superseding intervening cause of the harm, the
defect was not the proximate cause. An intervening cause of harm is a
superseding cause if its occurrence was unforeseeable. Thus, if it was
unforeseeable  that  the  contractor  would  disregard  the  warning,  the
contractor's conduct would be a superseding cause of the customer's
injury.  Although  cases  have  held  that  intervening  negligence  is
foreseeable, many cases have held that when the intervention involves
the disregard of a known risk, it is unforeseeable. For this reason, it
is  impossible  to  tell  whether  the  contractor's  intervening  conduct
would  be  found  to  be  unforeseeable.  Of  all  the  arguments  listed,
however,  A  is  the  only  one  that  could  possibly  be  effective  in  the
manufacturer's defense.

B  is  incorrect  because  strict  liability  may  be  applied  to  make  the
manufacturer of a defective product liable without regard to whether
it  acted  reasonably.  C  is  incorrect  because  strict  products  liability
may be imposed to benefit any injured person whose contact with the
defective product was foreseeable, without regard to the existence of
a  business  relationship  between  the  defendant  and  plaintiff.  D  is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  the
reasonable  person  in  the  store  owner's  position  would  not  have
selected  the  contractor  to  do  the  job,  and  second,  intervening
negligence by a third party is not a superseding cause of harm unless
it was unforeseeable.

177. D If the plaintiff is a public figure, he or she can recover in defamation
only  if  he  or  she  shows  that  the  statement  was  made  either  with
knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard to
its truth. However, if the plaintiff is a private figure, he or she is not

1078

required to prove that the defendant knew the statement was false or
recklessly  disregarded  its  truth  or  falsity.  However,  even  if  the
plaintiff is a private figure, he or she has to show at least negligence
by  the  defendant  regarding  the  truth  of  the  statement.  If  the  plaintiff
does  prove  that  defendant  was  negligent  in  not  ascertaining  that  the
communication was false, most states allow the plaintiff to recover if
the plaintiff is not a public figure. Here, the plaintiff has shown that
the defendant was at least negligent in making the statement. A and B
are  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  a  plaintiff  in  a
defamation  case  does  not  have  to  prove  that  the  defendant  actually
intended to cause harm to the plaintiff's reputation.

178. A Under the all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence, unreasonable
conduct by a plaintiff is a complete bar to recovery. Since the ladder
was in plain view, it was probably unreasonable (i.e., contributorily
negligent) for the employee not to see it. Although it is not certain that
a  jury  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  A  is  the  only  argument  listed
that could possibly provide the painter with an effective defense.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  special  rules  that  limit  the  duty  owed  to
trespassers protect only the landholder, and no one but he or she or a
member  of  his  or  her  household  may  successfully  assert  them  in
defense.  C  is  incorrect  because  a  defendant  owes  a  duty  of
reasonable care to any person who may foreseeably be injured by his
or her conduct, whether such persons are licensees of another or not.
One  whose  negligence  proximately  causes  an  injury  to  another  is
liable for damages even though there were other causes of that injury.
For this reason, D is incorrect.

179. D Under the “substantial factor” rule of causation, a defendant's conduct
is a cause of a particular consequence if it was a substantial factor in
bringing that consequence about. Conduct that would have produced a
particular  consequence  all  by  itself  was  a  substantial  factor  in
producing that consequence even if other factors happened to combine
with  that  conduct  to  bring  the  consequence  about.  Since  either
defendant's  conduct  alone  would  have  made  the  driver  intoxicated,
each  was  a  substantial  factor  in  making  the  driver  intoxicated.  Each
was,  therefore,  a  cause  of  the  driver's  intoxication.  Under  the  “but
for”  rule  of  causation,  a  condition  is  a  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm
would not have occurred without that condition. Since the plaintiff's
injury  would  not  have  occurred  had  the  driver  not  been  intoxicated,

1079

the driver's intoxication was a cause of the plaintiff's injury. Since the
conduct  of  both  defendants  were  causes  of  the  driver's  intoxication,
and since the driver's intoxication was a cause of the plaintiff's injury,
the conduct of both drivers were causes of the plaintiff's injury.

180.  A  The  fact  that  an  accident  occurred  is  not  enough  to  prove  that  the
architect was negligent, even if he could have avoided the accident by
using  two  pillars.  Negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct.  If  the
architect's conduct was reasonable, it could not have been negligent.
Since the facts are not sufficient to permit a conclusion as to whether
or not the architect's conduct was reasonable, it is not certain that a
jury would be convinced by the architect's contention. A  is  the  only
argument  listed,  however,  that  could  possibly  provide  the  architect
with an effective defense.

A  defendant  owes  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  all  persons  who  are
placed  at  foreseeable  risk  as  a  result  of  that  defendant's  conduct.
Since  it  was  foreseeable  that  the  landowner  would  hire  a  mover  to
bring furniture into the new house, the architect thus owed the mover a
duty  to  act  reasonably  in  designing  the  house  and  could  be  liable  to
the mover for breaching it. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  doctrine  of
“last clear chance” has become obsolete in most jurisdictions. All it
ever did (and all it does in those jurisdictions in which it survives) is
excuse  a  plaintiff  from  the  consequences  of  his  own  contributory
negligence. It was never an argument that a defendant would advance
because it never benefitted any party but a plaintiff. For these reasons,
it is inapplicable to this problem, and C is incorrect. D is incorrect
because the unreasonable exercise of professional judgment in making
a decision is negligence (or malpractice) and may result in liability.

181.  B  Violation  of  a  statute  may  establish  the  violator's  negligence  (or
liability)  in  a  particular  case  if  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect
against the risk that led to the plaintiff's harm. The pedestrian was not
hurt  because  the  man  was  drunk  but  because  the  man  had  been
poisoned.  (Note  that  the  facts  indicate  that  the  man  was  driving
reasonably.) If the statute was not meant to protect against the risk of
drinking poison, then its violation would not be relevant in the case of
an  injury  that  resulted  from  drinking  poison.  Since  poison  could  as
easily be drunk in non-alcoholic drinks, it is unlikely that the statute in
this case was designed to protect against drinking poison.

A is incorrect because the language of the statute appears to prohibit

1080

the  sale  of  alcohol  to  a  person  who  is  already  intoxicated  without
regard  to  how  he  got  intoxicated.  C  is  based  on  an  inaccurate
statement.  Conduct  is  a  cause  of  harm  if  that  harm  would  not  have
occurred without the conduct. Since the man's death and the resulting
accident  would  not  have  occurred  if  the  man  had  not  drunk  the
poisoned liquor, service of the liquor was a cause of the pedestrian's
injuries. C is therefore incorrect. If an intervening cause of harm was
unforeseeable,  it  may  be  called  a  superseding  cause  and  relieve  a
defendant of liability because his or her conduct was not a “legal” or
“proximate” cause of the injury. Causes that existed or occurred prior
to  the  defendant's  conduct  are  not  intervening  causes,  however,  and
therefore  cannot  be  superseding  causes  of  harm.  D  is  incorrect
because  the  employee's  conduct  preceded  the  bartender's  service  of
liquor to the man.

182. A Negligence is unreasonable conduct in the face of a foreseeable risk.
Thus,  unless  the  risk  that  the  contractor  created  was  foreseeable,  it
was not negligent for the contractor to create it. Adjusting the belt idle
improperly does not cause a belt truck to lurch if it is equipped with
an  accelerator  suppressor.  Thus,  if  belt  trucks  are  usually  equipped
with  acceleration  suppressors,  it  might  not  be  foreseeable  that
adjusting the belt idle improperly would cause a belt truck to lurch. If
this  risk  was  not  foreseeable,  the  contractor  was  not  negligent  in
creating  it.  Although  it  is  not  certain  that  a  jury  would  come  to  this
conclusion,  the  additional  fact  listed  in  A  is  the  only  one  that  could
possibly result in a judgment for the contractor.

Under  the  all-or-nothing  rule,  a  plaintiff  whose  own  negligence
contributed  to  the  accident  is  prevented  from  recovering.  B  is
incorrect,  however,  because  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  it  was
negligent  for  the  employee  to  attempt  to  activate  the  belt  while
standing on the ground. C and D are incorrect because a defendant is
liable  for  damage  that  was  proximately  caused  by  his  or  her
negligence  even  though  there  are  other  causes  or  other  parties  who
may also be liable.

183.  A  Public  nuisance  is  a  tortious  invasion  of  some  right  of  the  general
public. Ordinarily, a public nuisance action is brought on behalf of the
general  public  as  an  entity,  and  it  may  result  in  a  judgment  for
damage,  an  injunction,  or  both.  An  individual  may  bring  a  public
nuisance action on his or her own behalf, but only by showing that the

1081

public  nuisance  that  the  defendant  created  caused  the  individual
plaintiff  to  sustain  harm  so  different  from  that  of  the  general  public
that his or her damages would not be included in a judgment on behalf
of the general public. Most jurisdictions hold that in such an action,
the plaintiff's only remedy is a judgment for those damages. Since the
son's  claim  is  for  an  injunction  rather  than  for  the  son's  special
damage, public nuisance is not an appropriate vehicle for it.

An activity that does not disturb anyone but a super-sensitive plaintiff
is  probably  not  a  public  nuisance  since  it  does  not  interfere  with  a
public  right.  If  an  activity  does  disturb  the  general  public,  however,
and is therefore a public nuisance, the fact that the plaintiff's damage
resulted  from  a  special  sensitivity  will  not  prevent  him  or  her  from
recovering for that damage. (Note: This is the essence of the famous
“eggshell  skull”  hypothetical,  in  which  the  defendant  accidentally
drops  an  object  that  strikes  the  head  of  a  plaintiff  whose  skull  is  as
thin as an eggshell. If it was not foreseeable that dropping the object
would injure the ordinary person, the defendant was not negligent in
dropping it. But if it was foreseeable that dropping it would injure the
ordinary person, then the defendant was negligent in dropping it and
would be liable for the full extent of the plaintiff's injury even though
the ordinary person in the plaintiff's shoes would not have sustained
an injury as serious as that of the plaintiff.) B is therefore incorrect. A
plaintiff “assumes  the  risk”  when  he  or  she  voluntarily  encounters  a
risk  of  which  he  or  she  has  knowledge.  Although  assumption  of  the
risk  is  a  complete  defense  in  many  jurisdictions,  C  is  incorrect
because  the  claim  was  asserted  on  behalf  of  the  son,  and  the
homeowner  could  not  “assume  the  risk”  for  his  son.  D  is  incorrect,
because, although violation of a statute sometimes helps to establish
tort liability, compliance with a statute does not ordinarily prevent a
defendant from being liable in tort.

184. B A seller of a product that is defective at the time it was sold is held
strictly  liable  for  damages  that  result.  Thus,  if  the  product  was
defective when the drugstore sold it, the drugstore would be strictly
liable  to  the  doctor.  A  product  is  “defective  as  labeled”  if  its
condition  would  defeat  the  expectations  that  the  reasonable  person
would form upon reading its label. While it is not certain that a court
would come to this conclusion about the product, the argument in B is
the only one listed that could possibly support the doctor's claim.

1082

A  is  incorrect  because  the  negligence  of  a  manufacturer  is  not
ordinarily  imputed  to  a  retailer.  C  is  incorrect  because  any  express
warranty that was made referred to “normal hair or scalp” and would
therefore be inapplicable to the doctor. Although a drugstore might be
under  the  type  of  duty  set  forth  in  D,  there  is  no  indication  that  the
drugstore  failed  to  act  reasonably  in  pursuit  of  such  a  duty.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

185. C The statute given is typical of the “modified” comparative negligence
approach. Since the plaintiff was not at fault at all, however, it has no
relevance to her rights. No matter what approach a jurisdiction takes
to  contributory  or  comparative  negligence,  most  agree  that  joint
tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable to the injured plaintiff. In
this case, the court specifically held that the defendants are jointly and
severally  liable.  This  means  that  the  plaintiff  can  collect  all  her
damage from the first defendant, or the second defendant, or the two
of them in any combination.

186. A  In  general,  the  plaintiff  in  a  defamation  case  must  allege  and  prove
special damages to his or her reputation that occurred because of the
defendant's statements. However, if the defendant accuses the plaintiff
of having a “loathsome” disease (such as leprosy, venereal diseases,
or AIDS), the plaintiff is not required to show damages.

Consequently, B, C, and D are incorrect.

187.  B  All  the  products  liability  theories  require  proof  that  the  plaintiff
sustained damage as a result of his or her contact with the product. If
the man did not, he cannot succeed against the company on any theory.

A  is  incorrect  because  some  of  the  approaches  to  products  liability
(i.e., strict liability in tort and breach of warranty) do not depend on
the  unreasonableness  of  the  defendant's  conduct.  C  is  incorrect
because  compliance  with  a  statute  is  not  a  defense  to  any  products
liability  theory.  A  seller  who  recommends  a  particular  product,
knowing why the purchaser wants it and that the purchaser is relying
on the seller's judgment, may be held liable for breach of warranty if
the product is unfit for the buyer's particular purpose. D is incorrect,
however,  because  imposing  liability  on  the  grocery  store  would  not
prevent its being imposed on the company.

188.  C  Under  the  private  necessity  doctrine,  a  person  may  enter  another
person's  property  if  the  entry  is  necessary  to  protect  someone  from

1083

serious  harm.  This  is  a  complete  defense  to  a  trespass  claim.
However,  the  person  still  has  to  pay  for  any  damage  caused.  Here,
while the pilot was protecting himself from a plane crash, he would
still be liable for the damage to the crops. Therefore, A is incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  pilot's  lack  of  negligence  in  actually
landing the plane would not change the analysis in regards to private
necessity.  D  is  incorrect  because  although  the  pilot  could  probably
have made it back to the airport, the private necessity doctrine would
not require the pilot to be 100 percent sure that he could only avoid
serious harm by trespassing in the farmer's field.

189.  A  Intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  requires  outrageous
behavior that intentionally results in severe mental suffering. Because
the  plaintiff  was  only  embarrassed  by  the  incident,  the  defendant's
actions likely did not result in liability.

B is incorrect because even if the defendant was only joking, he may
still  have  had  the  required  mental  state  to  satisfy  the  intent
requirement if he desired or knew that mental suffering would result
from  his  act.  C  is  incorrect  because  although  some  jurisdictions
require  some  physical  manifestation  of  the  mental  suffering,  the
question  stated  the  plaintiff  was  only  embarrassed  and  suffered  no
physical  injury.  D  is  incorrect  because,  although  throwing  a
firecracker at someone could be outrageous, the plaintiff still did not
suffer the necessary harm.

190.  B  Negligence  is  a  breach  of  the  duty  to  act  reasonably.  A  defendant
owes such a duty to a plaintiff when the defendant's conduct creates a
foreseeable risk to the plaintiff. Since the installation of an automatic
door-opener  creates  obvious  risks  to  future  users  of  the  device,  the
installer owes them a duty to install it in a reasonable manner. If the
contractor  failed  to  do  so,  he  was  negligent.  Whether  or  not  it  was
unreasonable to disregard the warning is probably a question of fact
for the jury. The argument in B  is  the  only  one  listed,  however,  that
could possibly support the customer's claim.

When  the  defendant's  conduct  is  unknown,  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa
loquitur allows an inference that the defendant acted unreasonably to
be established circumstantially by proof that the accident was one that
would  not  ordinarily  have  occurred  without  negligence.  It  is
inapplicable  when  the  defendant's  conduct  was  known  and  the

1084

question to be determined is whether that conduct was unreasonable.
A is incorrect for this reason, and because there is no fact indicating
that  this  kind  of  accident  would  not  ordinarily  occur  without
negligence by the installer. According to UCC §2-314, every sale by a
merchant  implies  a  warranty  that  the  product  sold  is  fit  for  its
ordinary  use  (i.e.,  merchantable).  C  is  incorrect,  however,  because
the  contractor  did  not  sell  the  automatic  door-opener  and  therefore
did not impliedly warrant its fitness. The seller of a defective product
may  be  held  strictly  liable  for  damage  resulting  from  the  product's
defect. D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  contractor  was  not  the
seller of the automatic door-opener.

191. A Although damage is not an essential element of an action for trespass
to land, it is an essential element of a negligence action. Since there is
no indication that the homeowner was damaged, A is correct.

B is incorrect because, even in an emergency, a person is expected to
act as the reasonable person would under the circumstances (although
conduct that would ordinarily be regarded as unreasonable might be
reasonable in an emergency). While necessity is a defense to actions
for  intentional  tort,  it  is  not  a  defense  to  actions  founded  in
negligence.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  probably  an  accurate
statement, but its effect is to impose a duty of reasonable care on the
homeowner, not to relieve the driver of liability for negligence.

192.  A  The  doctor  can  only  be  liable  if  he  or  she  acted  unreasonably  in
treating  the  patient.  Here,  the  court  found  the  doctor  acted
unreasonably, so the doctor would be liable for the patient's damages.

If  there  is  no  evidence  as  to  what  the  defendant  did,  the  doctrine  of
res ipsa loquitur might allow an inference regarding the defendant's
conduct.  This  doctrine  applies  when  the  accident  is  one  that  would
not  ordinarily  occur  without  negligence  and  the  defendant  is  in
exclusive control of whatever caused the harm. Here, the defendant's
conduct is known, and the defendant was not in exclusive control of
the tanks when the manufacturer filled them. Therefore B is incorrect.
C and D are incorrect, because under the circumstances, the fact the
patient's death likely resulted from the manufacturer's negligence did
not  establish  that  the  death  did  not  also  result  from  the  doctor's
negligence.

QUESTIONS
____________________
PRACTICE MBE — A.M. EXAM

PRACTICE MBE — A.M. QUESTIONS

1. A man was looking out through the open window of his house when he
saw a robber knock down an old woman and snatch her handbag. As
the robber ran off with the woman's purse, the man grabbed a wooden
board and jumped through his window. After chasing the robber for
two blocks, the man caught up with him and struck him on the head
with the wooden board. The man retrieved the purse and returned it to
the woman. The robber subsequently died as the result of being struck
by the man.

If the man is prosecuted for criminal homicide, his most effective
argument in defense would be that he used force that

(A) the woman would have been privileged to use to defend herself.

(B) the reasonable person in the man's position would have used to

defend the woman.

(C) the reasonable person in the woman's position would have used to

defend her property.

(D) the reasonable person in the man's position would have used to

prevent the robber's escape from a crime.

2. At the trial of an action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant
for damages resulting from breach of contract, the plaintiff's attorney
called the witness as a witness on the plaintiff's direct case. After the
witness was sworn, the plaintiff's attorney asked only one question:
“Are you employed by the defendant in this case?” The witness
answered, “Yes.” The plaintiff's attorney then said, “I have no further
questions.”

On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the witness, “Do
you have any personal knowledge of the contract that is the basis of

1086

this lawsuit?”

If the plaintiff's attorney objects to the question, which of the following
would be the most effective argument in support of that objection?

(A) The defendant may not impeach its own witness.

(B) The question is leading.

(C) The question is argumentative.

(D) The question goes beyond the scope of cross-examination.

3. After being informed that members of a college fraternity were

engaged in the unlawful sale of cocaine, police officers obtained a
warrant to search the fraternity house. While searching, the officers
discovered the defendant, a guest of one of the fraternity's members,
sitting on a bed in a room of the house. Under the bed was a locked
trunk. Inside the trunk, the officers found a box of cocaine. They
immediately placed the defendant under arrest for possession of
cocaine and, upon searching her, found a plastic bag in her pocket
containing marijuana. Subsequently charged with the unlawful
possession of marijuana, the defendant moved to suppress use of the
marijuana as evidence against her.

Which of the following would be the prosecution's most effective
argument in response to the defendant's motion?

(A) Marijuana found in the defendant's possession could properly be

seized as “fruit of the poisonous tree.”

(B) The defendant's proximity to the trunk gave the officers probable
cause to believe that she was guilty of possessing cocaine.

(C) The officers searching the fraternity house were entitled to frisk all
persons present to protect themselves against the possibility of
physical attack.

(D) A warrant authorizing the search of specified premises permits the
arrest of all persons present at the time the warrant is executed.

4. Upon inheriting her aunt's ranch, the seller subdivided it into 1,000
separate numbered parcels of realty and offered them for sale. After
inspecting a parcel that had no building on it, the buyer and his attorney
went to see the seller in her sales office. After negotiation, the seller
accepted the buyer's offer to purchase the parcel for $15,000. At the

1087

buyer's request, the attorney prepared a contract of sale, using a printed
form that the attorney had brought with her. While doing so, the
attorney asked the seller how to identify the parcel involved. Although
its correct identification was “Parcel 241,” the seller inadvertently
referred to it as “Parcel 341.” None of them were aware of the seller's
error. As soon as the attorney finished preparing it, the seller and the
buyer signed a contract that described the realty as Parcel No. 341.

Although Parcels No. 241 and No. 341 were the same size, Parcel No.
341 had a valuable building on it that made it worth $80,000. Prior to
the date set for closing, the seller realized her mistake. She
immediately informed the buyer of the error. If the buyer sues the
seller for an order directing her to convey Parcel No. 341 to him for
$15,000, which of the following would be the seller's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) The buyer should have known that realty with a building on it was

more valuable than realty without a building on it.

(B) The buyer selected the attorney to prepare the contract.

(C) Parcel No. 341 was substantially more valuable than Parcel No.

241.

(D) Both the seller and the buyer were mistaken about the identity of the

parcel described in the contract.

5. A state law provides that no person may hold elective state office
while acting as a practicing member of the clergy of any religious
organization. The plaintiff, a practicing member of the clergy, asked the
state commissioner of elections to enter his name as a candidate for the
office of state legislator. The commissioner advised the plaintiff that
under the state law described above, she could do so only if the
plaintiff resigned his position.

If the plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of the state law on the
ground that it violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First
Amendment, which of the following arguments best supports the
conclusion that the statute is unconstitutional?

(A) A state may not set qualifications for elective state office that are

different from those for elective federal office.

(B) The state may not set qualifications for practicing members of the

1088

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

clergy of religious organizations.

(C) The statute creates political divisiveness along religious lines.

(D) The statute discriminates against persons because of their religious

affiliations.

6. A girl's mother, a citizen of State A, brought suit in federal district

court in State A against a saddle maker, a citizen of State B, after the
girl fell during a riding lesson. The mother bought the saddle from the
saddle maker online, and the saddle maker shipped it to her directly in
State A. State A's long-arm statute stated that service could be made on
out-of-state individuals by first-class mail, so long as the alleged
injury occurred within State A. State B did not allow service by mail.

Is service proper if the girl's mother sends it to the saddle maker by
first-class mail?

(A) Yes, because the federal district court sits in State A.

(B) Yes, because it is allowed under federal law.

(C) No, because it is not allowed under federal law.

(D) No, because State B does not allow it.

7. The victim, who was employed as a security guard, was required to
carry a loaded pistol on the job. While traveling to and from his job,
however, he kept the pistol unloaded. Driving to work one day, the
victim's car was struck from behind by a car operated by the defendant.
In the discussion that ensued, the defendant used language that the
victim found offensive. At that point, the victim turned his back on the
defendant and attempted to walk away. Angry, the defendant ran after
the victim and slapped him in the face. Although the victim did not
intend to shoot the defendant, he pulled his pistol from its holster and
began loading it, hoping that the defendant would become frightened
and leave him alone. When the defendant saw the victim loading the
pistol, he thought of running away, but he was afraid that the victim
would shoot him if he tried to do so. Drawing a knife from his pocket,
the defendant stabbed the victim in the chest. The defendant was
subsequently arrested and charged with assaulting the victim with a
deadly weapon.

If the defendant asserts the privilege of self-defense, he should be
found

1089

(A) guilty, because as the initial aggressor, the defendant had no

privilege to use deadly force.

(B) guilty, because the defendant could have successfully escaped in his

car without being shot by the victim.

(C) not guilty, because the defendant's fear of being shot by the victim

was reasonable.

(D) not guilty, because the victim should have known that by loading his
pistol, he was inviting the use of deadly force by the defendant.

8. The plaintiff was a passenger on a motorcycle operated by her friend
when it collided with a car operated by the defendant. As a result of
the collision, the plaintiff sustained injuries that required her
hospitalization. Although the plaintiff's hospital bills were high, they
were paid in full by the insurance company under a policy that the
plaintiff had purchased previously. In litigation by the plaintiff against
the defendant for negligence, a jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of
$50,000. Prior to the entry of judgment, the defendant's attorney made
an appropriate motion asking the court to reduce the damage award by
the amount that the plaintiff had already received from the insurance
company.

The motion to reduce the plaintiff's damage award should be

(A) denied, because the insurance company was not acting for any

person liable to the plaintiff for negligence.

(B) denied, because payment by the insurance company was not the

result of a judicial determination.

(C) granted, because the plaintiff should not be permitted to receive a

double recovery.

(D) granted, because the defendant is entitled to partial indemnity.

9. The defendant operated a computer repair business, servicing the

computers of several large organizations with the assistance of her
daughter. When the defendant decided to retire, she sold the entire
business to her daughter. As part of the sale, she assigned to her
daughter a written contract to repair and service all the plaintiff's
computers for a period of three years in return for a fixed monthly
payment.

1090

The day after her assignment to her daughter, the defendant notified the
plaintiff about it by telephone. Because the plaintiff knew that the
daughter had worked on his computers in the past, he consented to the
assignment and orally agreed to release the defendant from all further
obligation or liability under their contract. The plaintiff subsequently
became dissatisfied with the daughter's service, however, and asserted
a claim against the defendant for breach of contract.

If the defendant's only defense is that the plaintiff agreed to release her
from all further obligation or liability under their contract, which of
the following would be the plaintiff's most effective argument in
response to that defense?

(A) The defendant is attempting to use parol evidence to contradict or

modify the terms of an unambiguous written agreement.

(B) There was no consideration for the plaintiff's agreement to release

the defendant of further obligation or liability under the contract.

(C) The agreement to release the defendant of further obligation or

liability under the contract was not in writing.

(D) The defendant's delegation to her daughter and the plaintiff's
agreement to release the defendant constituted an accord and
satisfaction.

10. A doctor sued a truck driver in state court in State A for injuries he

received in an automobile accident. Under State A law, any negligence
on a plaintiff's part barred the plaintiff from recovery. The court found
in favor of the doctor and awarded him $100,000 in damages. The
truck driver then brought a negligence suit against the doctor in state
court in State A to recover the damages done to his truck. State A law
did not require any claim to be a compulsory counterclaim.

May the truck driver bring his action against the doctor?

(A) No, because the issue of the doctor's negligence was already

litigated.

(B) No, because the property damage arose from the same transaction

or occurrence.

(C) Yes, because State A does not require any claim to be a compulsory

counterclaim.

1091

(D) Yes, because the truck driver is bringing his action in a state court

in State A.

11. Congress passes a law providing that no one who has been a member
of an organization that uses unlawful means to deprive any group of
persons of their rights under the United States Constitution is eligible
for employment by the federal government. If the constitutionality of
that law is challenged, it should be held

(A) unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.

(B) unconstitutional, because it prohibits members of certain

organizations from holding public office without regard to whether
those members knew the purpose of the organizations to which they
belonged.

(C) constitutional, because employment by the federal government is

not a right but a privilege.

(D) constitutional, because the federal government has the right to
protect itself by not employing persons who hold views
inconsistent with the United States Constitution.

12. A river is located entirely within the state. Acting under authority

granted by Congress, the Federal Transportation Commission awarded
a contract to the company for the construction of a bridge over the river
so road users could enter a neighboring state for business. The contract
required that all materials used in constructing the bridge be purchased
within the state.

A state statute imposes a 6 percent sales tax, to be paid by the buyer,
on any purchases made within the state. Upon purchasing steel in the
state for use in the construction of the bridge, the company refused to
pay the sales tax. As a result, the state prosecuted the company for
violating the sales tax statute.

If the company's only defense is that in fulfilling a contract with the
federal government, it was immune from the state sales tax statute, the
court should find the company

(A) not guilty since the bridge was to be used in interstate commerce.

(B) not guilty, because the state lacks power to tax activities of the

federal government.

1092

(C) guilty, because independent contractors working for the federal

government are subject to state taxes.

(D) guilty, because the company's contract with the Federal

Transportation Commission was not on a cost-plus-fixed-profit
basis.

13. When the plaintiff applied for a job as a nurse at a hospital, the

hospital's personnel department sent questionnaires to doctors on its
staff, requesting information about the plaintiff. The defendant, a doctor
on staff, knew the plaintiff from when they had both been employed at
another clinic. Since the defendant had heard another doctor who was
very well respected as a trainer and mentor of nurses at that clinic
accuse the plaintiff of incompetence resulting in the death of a patient,
the defendant disliked the plaintiff. In fact, however, the doctor who
made the accusation had mistaken the plaintiff for another nurse, and
the plaintiff had been cleared of blame by a clinic board of inquiry.

Hoping that the plaintiff's job application would be rejected, the
defendant wrote on the questionnaire, “I once heard that the plaintiff's
incompetence resulted in the death of a patient.” The hospital did not
hire the plaintiff.

If the plaintiff asserts a defamation claim against the defendant for the
defendant's statement in the questionnaire, the court should find for

(A) The defendant, because the defendant reasonably believed that the

plaintiff's incompetence resulted in the death of a patient.

(B) The defendant, because the statement clearly indicated that the

defendant had heard the accusation from another.

(C) The plaintiff, because the defendant's dislike of the plaintiff and the
defendant's hope that the plaintiff's job application would be
rejected amounted to actual malice.

(D) The plaintiff, because the statement resulted in the hospital not

hiring the plaintiff.

14. In December 2009, the seller, a manufacturer of packaging materials,
entered into a written agreement with the buyer, a wholesaler of
melons. The agreement provided that the buyer would purchase from
the seller all the boxes required by the buyer for packaging melons in
2012, but that in no event would the number of boxes required be less

1093

than 2,000.

After the agreement was executed, the price of melons fell from $1 per
melon to $0.80 per melon. As a result, the buyer notified the seller in
January 2012 that he intended to package melons in bags instead of
boxes and that he would not order any boxes from the seller in 2012.

In January 2012, the seller instituted an action against the buyer for
damages. If the buyer asks the court to dismiss the seller's action,
should the court do so?

(A) Yes, because the buyer might still order 2,000 boxes by the end of

2012.

(B) Yes, because the provision that required the seller to furnish all the
boxes required by the buyer in 2012 makes it impossible for the
court to determine the seller's damages.

(C) No, because damages are presumed to result from every breach of

contract.

(D) No, because the buyer has stated that he will not fulfill his

obligations under the contract.

15. A riot broke out during a political rally in the town. Subsequently, a
newspaper published an editorial about the rally and the ensuing
disruption. The editorial stated that “Police present at the rally beat
and kicked innocent bystanders and engaged in other acts of senseless
and unnecessary brutality.” Following publication of the editorial, the
four police officers who were present at the rally asserted a
defamation claim against the newspaper.

The only argument raised by the newspaper in defense is that the
statements contained in the editorial did not identify the plaintiffs. The
court should find for

(A) the plaintiffs, because the number of police present at the rally was
so small that readers who knew the plaintiffs would believe that
the statement had been made about them.

(B) the plaintiffs, because they were engaged in their official duties as

police officers.

(C) the plaintiffs, because the statement was slander per se.

1094

(D) the newspaper, because the statement did not specifically name the

plaintiffs.

16. A woman was called as a juror in a claim brought in federal district
court. The action involved a man's claim that he was unlawfully
targeted and beaten by several local police officers because of his
race. During voir dire, the woman stated she would find it hard to keep
an open mind because she believed that police officers and
departments habitually discriminated against minorities. However, she
said she had no strong feelings or prior knowledge about the case or
the parties involved. Both the woman and the man were black, while
the police officers involved were white.

Based on her statements during voir dire, would it be proper for the
juror to be excused?

(A) No, because the juror cannot be excused based on her race.

(B) No, because the juror stated she had no strong feelings or prior

knowledge about the case or parties.

(C) Yes, because the juror stated it would be hard to keep an open

mind.

(D) Yes, because the juror had an implied bias in the man's favor.

17. The plaintiff asserted a tort claim against the defendant for battery but
died of cancer before the trial. At the trial, the witness was called as a
witness by the attorney for the plaintiff's estate. The witness testified
that she was a police officer called to the scene of a shooting, and that
when she arrived, she found the plaintiff lying on the ground in a pool
of blood. The witness stated that when she asked the plaintiff to tell her
what happened, the plaintiff replied, “Tell my wife to meet me at the
hospital and tell her that the defendant shot me.”

The defendant objected. If the court finds that the plaintiff's statement
to the witness was not a dying declaration, it will probably be because

(A) the plaintiff did not believe that he was dying when he made the

statement.

(B) the plaintiff did not die as a result of the shooting.

(C) the witness's testimony was not being offered at the trial of a

criminal prosecution.

1095

(D) the plaintiff's statement was not made spontaneously.

18. A man was injured when a boiler in his building exploded. The man

sued the owner of the building. The man hired an accident investigator
who talked to one of the building's maintenance workers. The
maintenance worker told the investigator that the boiler exploded
because the building owner failed to make necessary repairs. The man
also hired an expert in boiler explosions. The expert read the
investigator's report. The expert then testified on behalf of the man,
saying the boiler exploded because the building owner failed to make
necessary repairs. She based her testimony in part on the maintenance
worker's statement because other experts in boiler explosion analysis
would do so.

Assuming the maintenance worker's statement is inadmissible hearsay,
may the expert base part of her testimony on the statement?

(A) No, because the maintenance worker's statement is not

substantively admissible.

(B) No, because the expert did not interview the maintenance worker

herself.

(C) Yes, because the expert's use of the statement in her testimony

makes the statement substantively admissible.

(D) Yes, because other experts in the field would rely on the

maintenance worker's statement.

19. After serving a portion of his sentence in a state prison, the plaintiff

applied for parole in accordance with state law. His application was
denied following a State Parole Board hearing at which the plaintiff
was not permitted to appear either in person or by counsel. The
plaintiff subsequently instituted a proceeding in a state court in which
he claimed that the hearing violated his right to due process under the
federal and state constitutions. The state court found for the plaintiff.
On appeal by the State Parole Board, the highest appellate court in the
state affirmed. In its decision, the court refused to consider claims
under the federal constitution but concluded that the state constitution
had been violated.

On application by the State Parole Board, is judicial review by the
United States Supreme Court available?

1096

(A) No.

(B) Yes, by certiorari only.

(C) Yes, by appeal only.

(D) Yes, by either certiorari or appeal.

20. The defendant was charged with violating a state law that made it a

crime to knowingly issue a worthless check. On the presentation of its
direct case at trial, the prosecution offered into evidence a properly
authenticated judgment showing that the defendant had been convicted
of violating the same law three years earlier. The defendant's counsel
objected. Which of the following statements is correct about the
judgment of conviction?

(A) It is admissible as substantive evidence of modus operandi.

(B) It is admissible to impeach the defendant's credibility.

(C) It is admissible both as substantive evidence of modus operandi

and to impeach the defendant's credibility.

(D) It is inadmissible.

21. A landowner conveyed a large nature area “to the county, but if the
land ceases to be used as a nature park, to my friend and his heirs.”
What interests are created by this conveyance?

(A) The county has a fee simple absolute.

(B) The county has a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, and

the friend has an executory interest.

(C) The county has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and

the friend has a right of entry.

(D) The county has a fee simple determinable, and the friend has a

possibility of reverter.

22. A landowner decided to make a gift to his son of a parcel of land he
owned. He properly prepared a deed for the transfer of the land
according to state law and handed it to his son, saying “I want you to
own this land.” Nine months later, the landowner met a woman and fell
deeply in love with her. Soon thereafter, he had a fight with his son
about the woman. He told his son to return or destroy the deed because
he was “revoking his gift.” The son made a photocopy of the deed and
gave the deed back to the landowner. The landowner then threw the

1097

deed in a fire. Two months later, the landowner died, leaving all of his
real and personal property to the woman.

Who owns the land?

(A) The woman, because the son returned the deed to the landowner.

(B) The woman, because the landowner told the son he was revoking

his gift.

(C) The son, because he kept a photocopy of the deed.

(D) The son, because the landowner gave him the deed.

23. A woman purchased a food and beverage processing machine as a gift
for her husband. The machine was manufactured by the company and
was purchased by the woman from a store, a retailer. When the woman
got home, she unpacked the machine, placed it on the kitchen counter,
and plugged it into an electrical outlet. When she started the machine,
however, she noticed a jarring vibration. She immediately switched the
machine off and telephoned the store. After she described the vibration
to a store employee, the employee said, “If the processor vibrates like
that, it is defective. Don't try to use it. It's inherently dangerous.”

The woman left the processing machine on the counter, still plugged in,
and went out for the evening. The husband arrived home soon
afterwards. With him was a neighbor. When the husband saw the
processing machine on the counter, he decided to use it to mix drinks
for the neighbor and himself. After placing the necessary ingredients in
the machine's glass container, the husband switched it on. The machine
immediately began to vibrate, causing the glass container to shatter.
The neighbor was seriously injured by flying glass.

The neighbor asserts a claim against the store for damages resulting
from a defect in the processing machine. Which of the following
would be the store's most effective argument in defense against that
claim?

(A) The neighbor was a bystander.

(B) The woman had assumed the risk by leaving the processing

machine plugged into the electrical outlet.

(C) The processing machine was defective at the time it left the

company's factory.

1098

(D) The woman's conduct in leaving the processing machine plugged
into the electrical outlet was a superseding cause of harm.

24. The plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of a state law that

provides that no contraceptive device that requires insertion into a
cavity of the human body may be sold without a prescription. If the
only argument used by the plaintiff is that the statute violates the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because only women
use such devices, which of the following would be the most effective
argument in opposition to the plaintiff's claim?

(A) Gender is not a suspect classification.

(B) The statute has a rational basis because devices inserted into the

human body are more likely to cause harm than devices
manufactured solely for external use.

(C) The right to protect citizens against their own lack of judgment is

included in the state's police powers.

(D) The statute bears a substantial relationship to an important

government interest because devices inserted into the human body
are more likely to cause harm than devices manufactured solely for
external use.

25. On January 10, the plaintiff, a builder, entered into a written contract

with the defendant to construct a building on the defendant's realty. The
contract required the plaintiff to build to specifications furnished by the
architect and required the defendant to make periodic payments to the
plaintiff during construction. A final payment of $30,000 was to be
made when the building was complete. The contract provided,
however, that “In no event shall said final payment be required unless
the plaintiff obtains and presents to the defendant prior to July 30 a
Certificate of Satisfactory Completion issued by the architect
following final inspection by the architect.”

On July 15, after making all periodic payments required by the
contract, the defendant asked the architect to delay issuing a
Certificate of Satisfactory Completion until after July 30. The architect
agreed to do so. On July 20, the plaintiff notified the architect that the
building was complete and requested final inspection. The architect
did not inspect the building or issue a Certificate of Satisfactory
Completion until August 15. On August 16, the plaintiff requested final
payment from the defendant, presenting the Certificate. The defendant

1099

refused to make payment on the ground that the plaintiff did not obtain
the Certificate prior to July 30, as required by the contract.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for breach of
contract, which of the following would be the plaintiff's most effective
argument?

(A) The contract between the plaintiff and the defendant imposed upon

the architect an obligation to act reasonably in issuing the
Certificate of Satisfactory Completion.

(B) The plaintiff substantially performed all conditions of the contract

by completing the building prior to July 30.

(C) As a result of the defendant's request that the architect delay issuing
the Certificate of Satisfactory Completion, the plaintiff was not
required to obtain it prior to July 30.

(D) Applying an objective standard, satisfactory completion was

achieved prior to July 30.

26. At the defendant's trial on criminal charges, undisputed evidence
established that the defendant and his friend had planned to take a
certain fur coat from the victim's fur shop by threatening the victim
with a pistol carried by the friend; that when they did so, the victim
began shooting at them; and that the friend shot back with his pistol,
intentionally killing the victim.

Testifying on behalf of the prosecution, the friend stated that the
defendant knew that the friend's pistol would be loaded. He also stated
that the victim had handed the defendant the coat; that the friend had
returned his own gun to his pocket; and that he and the defendant were
on their way out of the victim's shop when the victim began shooting at
them.

The defendant testified that the coat in question had previously been
stolen from her by the victim, and that she and the friend were trying to
retrieve it.

Statutes in the jurisdiction define first degree murder as the intentional
unlawful killing of a human being, and second degree murder as the
unintentional killing of a human being by the defendant or an
accomplice during the course of a burglary, robbery, rape, kidnapping,

1100

or arson committed by the defendant.

The defendant is charged with first degree murder on the ground that
as a co-conspirator and accomplice, she is vicariously liable for the
friend's shooting of the victim. If the jury does not believe the
testimony of the friend or of the defendant, the defendant should be
found

(A) guilty, because she and the friend planned to take the coat by

threatening the victim with the friend's pistol.

(B) guilty, because she was present when the friend shot the victim.

(C) not guilty, because the victim shot first.

(D) not guilty, because she did not aid 

or abet the friend in shooting the victim.

27. On February 1, the landowner conveyed a parcel of realty to his friend
as a gift. The landowner executed the deed in the presence of a notary
public, and the notary affixed his seal as required by law. On March 1,
after the landowner learned that his friend had not recorded his title,
the landowner purported to convey the same parcel of realty to his
neighbor for value. The neighbor was unaware that the landowner's
friend held any interest in the 
realty. On March 15, the friend recorded the deed that he had received
from the landowner in February. In June, the neighbor executed a deed
conveying the realty to the notary. The notary immediately recorded the
deed.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “No transfer of an interest in
real property shall be good against a subsequent purchaser for value
without notice of such transfer unless it shall have been recorded.” In
litigation between the friend and the notary, who should be declared
owner of the realty?

(A) The friend, because the notary had notice that the realty had first

been conveyed to him.

(B) The friend because the landowner conveyed the property to him

first.

(C) The neighbor, because he purchased the property for value.

(D) The notary, because the neighbor 

1101

purchased the realty from the landowner before the friend recorded
his deed.

28. A boy and a girl were dating when they decided it was time for them to

try sexual intercourse. The girl was 17 years old. A statute in the
jurisdiction provided that any male who has sexual intercourse with a
female whom he knows to be under the age of 18 shall be guilty of
second degree rape.

If the boy is charged with second degree rape under the above statute,
which of the following facts or inferences, if it was the only one true,
would provide the boy with his most effective defense to that charge?

(A) The boy was 17 years of age at the time of the alleged crime.

(B) The boy did not know that the girl was below the age of 18 years

when he had sexual intercourse with her.

(C) The boy was intoxicated at the time he had sexual intercourse with

the girl.

(D) The girl was not intoxicated, and, in fact, consented to having

sexual intercourse with the boy.

29. A man sued a moving company for $100,000 in state court in State A
after the man was injured by one of the moving company's trucks. His
claim was based on State A motor vehicle law. The man was a citizen
of State A. The moving company was incorporated in State B and had
70 percent of its business operations in State A. However, all of the
company's directors and top management worked in State C.

Because of a large amount of local bad press, the moving company had
a good faith belief that any action against it in State A would be unfair.
May it remove the action to federal district court?

(A) No, because the man's claim was based on State A motor vehicle

law.

(B) No, because the moving company was a citizen of State A.

(C) Yes, because the moving company's directors and top management

worked in State C.

(D) Yes, because the moving company had a good faith belief that any

action against it in State A would be unfair.

1102

30. The defendant was driving her truck across a bridge when the bridge
collapsed, causing a car driven by the plaintiff to fall into the river.
The plaintiff subsequently asserted a negligence claim against the
defendant for injuries that he sustained in the fall.

A statute in the jurisdiction prohibits the operation of a vehicle
weighing more than 20,000 pounds at a speed in excess of 25 miles
per hour on any bridge in the state. At the trial, it was proven that the
defendant's truck weighed 30,000 pounds, and that the defendant was
driving it at a speed of 40 miles per hour when the bridge collapsed. It
was also proven that a truck weighing 30,000 pounds would have been
more likely to cause the bridge to collapse if driven across it at a
speed under 25 miles per hour than at a speed over 25 miles per hour.

The court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant's violation of the statute was

negligence per se.

(B) the plaintiff, because the defendant's violation of the statute raises a
presumption that the defendant's negligence was a proximate cause
of the plaintiff's injuries.

(C) the defendant, because the defendant's violation of statute was not a

factual cause of the plaintiff's injury.

(D) the defendant, because the defendant did not violate a statute that
was designed to protect a class of persons to which the plaintiff
belonged.

31. The landowner conveyed a lakefront parcel of realty to the buyer

“unless the realty is used for non-residential purposes, in which case
grantor or his successors may re-obtain possession.” Two years later,
by a properly executed document that was subsequently recorded, the
buyer granted a fisherman a license to enter the realty for a period of
five years to fish from the lake on which it fronted. If the landowner
commences an appropriate proceeding seeking possession of the realty,
the buyer's most effective argument in defense would be that

(A) the condition contained in the landowner's deed to the buyer

violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(B) fishing is a residential use of the realty.

(C) the landowner's deed created a fee simple subject to a condition

1103

subsequent.

(D) the condition contained in the landowner's deed to the buyer is void

as a restraint on alienation.

32. A sculptor and a famous architect entered into a contract to design a

new studio for the sculptor. The sculptor told the architect that she was
hiring her because she believed in her unique vision. The written
contract also provided that “neither party shall assign or delegate this
contract without the other party's written approval.”

The sculptor subsequently hired a builder who began construction of
the architect's design. As work progressed, the sculptor and the
architect argued frequently. When the building was 85 percent
complete, the architect refused to continue working for the sculptor
and executed a document purporting to assign the contract to another
architect. The architectural work that remained involved personal
services. The sculptor immediately ordered the builder to stop
construction and sued the architect for an order directing her to
specifically perform her obligations under the contract.

Should the court grant the relief requested by the sculptor?

(A) Yes, because the architectural work that remained to be completed
at the time of the architect's assignment involved personal services.

(B) Yes, because the agreement between the sculptor and the architect

prohibited assignment.

(C) No, because an agreement not to assign destroys the power but not

the right to make a valid assignment.

(D) No, because the architectural work that remained to be completed

at the time of the architect's assignment involved personal services.

33. At the trial of a breach of contract action brought by the plaintiff

against the defendant, the plaintiff testified in her own behalf. The
plaintiff stated that a man who called her on the telephone said that he
was the defendant and ordered goods from her at an agreed price. She
said that when she tried to deliver the goods, the defendant refused to
accept them. The plaintiff stated further that she had never spoken to
the defendant before or after that telephone conversation, but that she
had heard his voice in the judge's chambers immediately before the
trial began and that she recognized it as the voice of the person to

1104

whom she had spoken on the telephone.

If the defendant's attorney asks the court to exclude the plaintiff's
testimony regarding the identification of the voice on the telephone, the
plaintiff's statement should be

(A) admitted, because the plaintiff heard the defendant's voice in the

judge's chambers before testifying.

(B) admitted, because the person to whom the plaintiff spoke on the

telephone identified himself as the defendant.

(C) excluded, because the plaintiff had never spoken to the defendant

prior to the telephone conversation.

(D) excluded, because the plaintiff had not dialed the defendant's
telephone number before speaking to him on the telephone.

34. A chemical used in the manufacture of munitions is frequently found
floating, as dust, in the air of munitions factories. Since prolonged
inhalation of the chemical can cause lung disease, Congress passes an
Act to limit use of the chemical. Among other things, the Act prohibits
the operation of any munitions factory in which the chemical's airborne
levels exceed specified standards. The Act also establishes an Agency,
authorizes it to inspect munitions factories, and empowers it to issue
Closure Orders, enforceable by the Department of Justice, and
directing the closing of any factory operating in violation of the Act.
Section 34 of the Act provides that Closure Orders do not become
effective until 10 days after their approval by the National Defense
Committee of the Senate.

After determining that airborne levels of the chemical exceed statutory
standards in a munitions factory operated by the company, the Agency
issues a Closure Order, sending copies to the United States
Department of Justice and to the Senate National Defense Committee
as required by the Act. The Senate National Defense Committee
refuses to approve the Closure Order.

If the Department of Justice challenges the constitutionality of Section
34 of the Act in an appropriate proceeding, the court should find this
section

(A) constitutional, because circumstances known only to the Senate

National Defense Committee might make the continued operation of

1105

a particular munitions factory necessary to national security.

(B) constitutional, because after delegating its power to an

administrative agency, Congress may continue to act in a
supervisory capacity.

(C) unconstitutional, because Congress may not delegate to an

administrative agency the power to impose criminal or quasi-
criminal sanctions.

(D) unconstitutional, because Section 34 would allow the passage of

legislation by a committee of Congress.

35. The victim, who lived alone, was a collector of antiques. One day, the
defendant followed the victim to work. Knowing that the victim's
valuable antiques collection was stored in her home, the defendant
phoned the victim at work and told her that he had placed a bomb in
her home. He said that if she immediately paid him $1,000 in cash, he
would give the police information necessary for them to defuse the
bomb. If she did not pay him, he said would detonate the bomb,
destroying her home and her collection of antiques. The victim paid the
defendant as instructed. In reality, the defendant had not placed a bomb
in the victim's home.

What is the most serious offense of which the defendant is likely to be
convicted?

(A) Robbery.

(B) Extortion.

(C) Larceny by trick.

(D) Embezzlement.

36. A state law requires a permit for the use of certain recreational

facilities in state parks and fixes the annual fee for such permits at $25
for residents and $200 for non-residents. If a non-resident of the state
challenges the law as unconstitutional, the LEAST effective argument
in support of that claim would be that the law violates

(A) the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) the Obligation of Contracts Clause of Article I.

(C) the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

1106

(D) the Commerce Clause of Article I.

37. The seller and the buyer entered into a valid written contract for the
sale of the seller's home to the buyer. Subsequently, the seller's
neighbor, the defendant, telephoned the seller and said, “If you don't
back out of your contract with the buyer, there's going to be an accident
and one of your children is going to be seriously hurt. Understand?”
Before the seller had a chance to answer, the defendant hung up. The
seller became so frightened by the defendant's threat that he suffered an
immediate heart attack.

If the seller asserts a claim against the defendant for assault, which of
the following would be the defendant's LEAST effective argument in
defense against that claim?

(A) The defendant's statement did not justify apprehension of immediate

harm.

(B) The defendant told the seller that he could avoid harm by

complying with a specified condition.

(C) The defendant's threat was not directed against the person of the

seller.

(D) The defendant committed no physical act.

38. At his trial on a charge of arson committed in the city, the defendant
testified that on the day of the fire, he was not in the city but was
actually 1,000 miles away in another state. The prosecution
subsequently called a witness who testified that on the day of the fire,
she was in a liquor store in the city when the defendant came into the
store with a gun and robbed its owner. Over timely objection by the
defendant's attorney, the witness's testimony should be

(A) admitted for impeachment only.

(B) admitted as substantive evidence only.

(C) admitted for impeachment and as substantive evidence.

(D) excluded.

39. The landowner was the owner of a parcel of realty on which there

were several buildings and a gold mine. The landowner lived in one of
the buildings and personally worked the gold mine, earning a
comfortable living by selling the gold that he removed. The other

1107

buildings were vacant. When the landowner died, his will devised the
realty “to my friend, but if my friend should die without issue from his
wife, to the mailman.” The landowner's friend and his wife did not
have any children.

Which of the following statements is correct about the mailman's
interest in the realty?

(A) The landowner's will gave the mailman a vested remainder in the

property.

(B) The landowner's will gave the mailman a contingent remainder in

the property.

(C) The landowner's will gave the mailman a shifting executory interest

in the realty.

(D) The mailman has no interest in the realty.

40. After she was fired from her job, a saleswoman brought an action

against her former employer in federal district court in State A. The
saleswoman sought $50,000 in damages. The saleswoman was a
citizen of State A, while her former employer was incorporated in
State B and had its primary place of business in State C. The
saleswoman's action included claims for violation of federal
employment laws and for breach of contract under State A law. The
employer moved to dismiss the breach of contract claim.

How should the court rule?

(A) Grant the motion, because the contract claim is based on state law.

(B) Grant the motion, because the saleswoman is only claiming

$50,000 in damages.

(C) Deny the motion, because the saleswoman can bring all claims she

has against the company in her action.

(D) Deny the motion, because all of her claims arose from the

saleswoman's loss of her job.

41. At the defendant's trial on a charge of rape, the victim testified that on
March 1, the defendant forced her to have sexual intercourse with him
against her will. Testifying in his own defense, the defendant admitted
that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim on that date,
but he claimed that the victim had consented. The defendant stated

1108

further that the victim had not accused him of rape until April 3, when
she discovered that he was married and was living with his wife.

The prosecutor subsequently offered a properly authenticated public
record indicating that the defendant had been convicted of state income
tax fraud in another jurisdiction two years earlier. In both the
jurisdiction where the defendant was convicted and the jurisdiction
where the defendant was being tried for rape, state income tax fraud
was a felony. On objection by the defendant's attorney, the record
should be

(A) admitted.

(B) admitted, because state income tax fraud is a felony in the

jurisdiction where the defendant was convicted.

(C) admitted, because state income tax fraud is a felony in the
jurisdiction where the defendant was being tried for rape.

(D) excluded.

42. The defendant had been convicted of fraud on three separate occasions
and served three different prison sentences as a result. Soon after his
most recent release, the defendant proclaimed himself to be a minister
and began conducting prayer meetings on Sunday nights. During these
meetings, the defendant stated that his vows as minister prevented him
from working for money, and he asked the people present to make cash
contributions to provide for his personal needs. After collecting
several hundred dollars in this fashion, the defendant was arrested and
charged with fraud under a state law that prohibits any person from
making statements that he or she knows to be false for the purpose of
obtaining money from others.

In defense, the defendant asserted that a court could not convict him
without questioning the sincerity of his religious beliefs, and that the
prosecution therefore violated his First Amendment rights to freedom
of religion. He asked that the court dismiss the prosecution on that
ground.

Should the prosecution be dismissed?

(A) Yes.

(B) No, because a court may determine the sincerity of a person's

1109

religious beliefs without violating First Amendment rights to
freedom of religion.

(C) No, because First Amendment rights to freedom of religion cannot

be used to justify what would otherwise be a criminal act.

(D) No, because First Amendment rights to freedom of religion protect

beliefs, but not actions.

43. In which one of the following fact situations is the defendant most

likely to be properly convicted of violating a state law that prohibits
depriving any person of a right conferred by the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution?

(A) The defendant, the president of a university operated by a religious
organization, refused to admit certain students solely because of
their religion.

(B) The defendant, a federal court official, prevented certain persons
from serving on federal juries solely because of their race.

(C) The defendant, the principal of a public high school, expelled

certain students solely because they were pregnant.

(D) The defendant, the vice president of a bank, refused to grant loans
to certain applicants solely because of their place of national
origin.

44. The defendant was the manufacturer of a chemical used by photo
processors. A professional photographer customarily used the
chemical in his processing laboratory. On August 15, 2012, while
working in his laboratory, the photographer read the label of a bottle of
the chemical that he had purchased several months earlier. The label
said, “Best when used prior to June 1, 2012.” Although the
manufacturer knew that the chemical's fumes were extremely toxic, the
label contained no other statements. The photographer poured the
contents of the bottle down a drain that emptied into a municipal sewer.
Because the sewer was cracked, toxic fumes entered the home of the
plaintiff, causing the plaintiff to become seriously ill. The plaintiff's
home was located a half-mile from the photographer's laboratory.

The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim for damages against the
defendant manufacturer on the ground that the absence of a warning on
the bottle made the product defective and unreasonably dangerous.

1110

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would provide the defendant with its most effective
defense to the plaintiff's claim?

(A) The reasonable person would not have anticipated that the plaintiff

would come into contact with the chemical or its fumes.

(B) The photographer acted negligently in pouring the chemical down

the drain.

(C) The plaintiff's damage would not have occurred but for the crack in

the municipal sewer.

(D) The photographer had purchased the chemical from a retail store

that had purchased it from a wholesaler that had purchased it from
the defendant.

45. A man was injured when he was hit by a taxi. He sued the taxi driver in

federal district court in State A. Under the applicable statute of
limitations, the action had to be commenced by June 16 and an action
was deemed commenced when it was filed with the court. The man
filed his action on June 11. On June 12, he served the complaint on the
taxi driver. On June 13, he received a call from the owner of the taxi
company asking whether he would be brought into the action as well.
The man filed an amended complaint on June 17 that added the owner
as a co-defendant. On June 22, the man served the amended complaint
on both the taxi driver and the owner. The owner moved to dismiss the
complaint, arguing it was barred by the statute of limitations.

How should the court rule?

(A) Grant the motion, because the complaint was served on the owner

more than 10 days after the action commenced.

(B) Grant the motion, because the complaint was amended on June 17.

(C) Deny the motion, because both claims related to the taxi accident.

(D) Deny the motion, because the owner called to ask about the original

complaint.

46. A woman was the owner of a parcel of realty on which she lived with
her husband. The woman was admitted to a hospital following a severe
heart attack. While her husband was visiting her in the hospital, the
woman said, “I know I'm dying, and I want to be sure that you have the
land after I'm gone. Please have our lawyer take care of it.” The

1111

following day, the husband asked the family attorney to prepare a
quitclaim deed to the land for execution by the woman. The husband
brought the document to the woman in the hospital, where she executed
it according to the requirements of law. After signing the quitclaim
deed, the woman handed the document to the husband and said, “Please
put it in the safe deposit box at the bank.” The husband did so, but he
never recorded the quitclaim.

The woman subsequently recovered from her heart attack and was
moved from the hospital to a rest home, where she resided until 30
years later, when she died from other causes. At the woman's request,
the husband continued to occupy, maintain, and pay taxes on the land
throughout that period of time. During the last nine years of her life in
the rest home, the woman was attended by a nurse. When the woman
died, her will purported to leave the land “to my faithful nurse.” The
husband and the nurse subsequently asserted conflicting claims to the
land.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
husband?

(A) The woman intended the quitclaim deed to be a testamentary

substitute.

(B) The quitclaim deed to the husband was a gift causa mortis.

(C) The safe deposit box into which the woman asked the husband to
put the quitclaim deed was held jointly by the woman and the
husband.

(D) The statutory period for adverse possession is less than 30 years.

47. Assuming that the appropriate objection is made, in which of the

following fact situations is the offered evidence LEAST likely to be
excluded under the original document rule?

(A) In an action for breach of contract, the plaintiff offers a photocopy
of the contract, asserting that the original is kept at the plaintiff's
branch office, which is located in a foreign country.

(B) In a prosecution of the defendant for forging a check, the

prosecution — without producing the check or explaining its
absence — offers to call a witness who will testify that the

1112

defendant paid the witness for merchandise with a check to which
the defendant signed the name “James Grant.”

(C) In a personal injury action, the defendant — without producing the
X-ray or explaining its absence — calls a medical expert who
testifies that based solely on the examination of an X-ray, it is her
opinion that the plaintiff did not sustain a fracture of the skull.

(D) In a lawsuit by the plaintiff against the state tax collector, the

plaintiff offers to testify to the contents of her state income tax
return, asserting that she sent the original to the state tax collector
as required by law, and that she did not keep a copy.

48. A woman from the Southern District of State A was injured in a boating
accident in the Eastern District of State B. The woman sued two other
boaters involved in the accident in a federal action based on diversity.
The first was a doctor from the Western District of State C. The second
was a nurse from the Eastern District of State C.

In which judicial districts would venue be proper for the woman's
action?

(A) The Eastern District of State B.

(B) The Southern District of State A and the Eastern District of State B.

(C) The Western District of State C and the Eastern District of State C.

(D) The Eastern District of State B, the Western District of State C, and

the Eastern District of State C.

49. The defendant was employed by an attorney to clean his office and to
sweep the parking lot every night. While sweeping one evening, the
defendant found the attorney's wallet where he had dropped it in the
parking lot. The wallet contained $300. Planning to return it to the
attorney the next morning, the defendant took the wallet home for
safekeeping. That night, however, realizing that nobody knew that she
had it. the defendant decided to keep the attorney's wallet. She went out
and spent $4 of the attorney's money on ice cream. The following
morning, the defendant felt guilty about keeping the attorney's money.
She replaced what she had spent and returned the wallet and cash to
the attorney.

If the defendant is prosecuted for crimes resulting from the above
incident, she may properly be convicted of

1113

(A) larceny only.

(B) embezzlement only.

(C) neither larceny nor embezzlement.

(D) larceny and embezzlement.

50. The defendant purchased property in a popular resort area and

constructed a restaurant on it. The defendant's restaurant was equipped
with a walk-up window so that people who chose to do so could
purchase food and soft drinks without entering the restaurant. The
defendant kept his restaurant and walk-up window open every night
until 2 A.M. Soon, large noisy crowds of young people began
congregating in front of the defendant's restaurant, making occasional
purchases at the walk-up window and remaining there until it closed.
On many nights, members of the crowd openly smoked marijuana and
used profane language in loud voices. The plaintiff, who resided in a
house next to the restaurant, telephoned the defendant. The plaintiff
complained that the value of his home was being diminished by the
walk-up window and by noise from the restaurant. He asked the
defendant to close the restaurant each night at 11 P.M., but the defendant
refused.

If the plaintiff subsequently asserts a claim against the defendant for
damages resulting from the reduction of his home's value, which of the
following theories would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
plaintiff?

(A) Trespass to land.

(B) Intentional infliction of emotional distress.

(C) Private nuisance.

(D) Invasion of privacy.

51. Because of severe economic recession, the state has enacted a statute

imposing a tax on corporations that have gross sales within the state in
excess of $1 million during a calendar year. The statute applies to all
such corporations, whether incorporated inside or outside the state. It
establishes a sliding-scale tax schedule with a maximum tax rate of 10
percent of gross sales in excess of $1 million.

Which of the following persons or entities is most likely to have

1114

standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on the ground
that it violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution?

(A) The governor of a neighboring state.

(B) The stockholders of a state corporation with annual gross sales of

$1.5 million in the state.

(C) The stockholders of an out-of-state corporation with annual gross

sales of $500,000 in the state.

(D) A taxpayer in the state.

52. When the landowner died, she left a one-half interest in a parcel of
realty to her niece and the niece's husband, as joint tenants with full
right of survivorship, and a one-half interest in the realty to the 13-
year-old unmarried daughter of the landowner. One year later, the
niece, the husband, and the daughter were killed simultaneously in an
automobile accident.

Which of the following statements correctly describes ownership of
the realty following their deaths?

(A) The heirs of the daughter hold a one-half interest, the heirs of the

niece hold a one-quarter interest, and the heirs of the husband hold
a one-quarter interest.

(B) The entire property is held by the heirs of the daughter.

(C) The heirs of the daughter hold a one-third interest, the heirs of the
niece hold a one-third interest, and the heirs of the husband hold a
one-third interest.

(D) The heirs of the niece hold a one-half interest and the heirs of the

husband hold a one-half interest.

53. The landowner was the owner of a large tract of realty located in a

heavily forested area. In January 2012, the landowner leased the realty
to a friend for a period of 20 years. In March 2012, the landowner sold
the realty to an artist, executing a general warranty deed containing
covenants of seisin, quiet enjoyment, the right to convey, and a
covenant against encumbrances. In April 2012, the artist conveyed the
realty to a baker by a deed containing covenants substantially identical
to those contained in the deed that the artist had received from the
landowner. In May 2012, the artist became insolvent. In June 2012, the
baker attempted to move onto the realty and was prevented from doing

1115

so by the friend, who claimed a superior right.

If the baker subsequently asserts a claim for damages against the
landowner, the baker's most effective theory would be that the
landowner breached the warranty

(A) of seisin.

(B) against encumbrances.

(C) of the right to convey.

(D) of quiet enjoyment.

54. The defendant was the operator of a summer camp for children. The
plaintiff was a nine-year-old child staying at the camp, her parents
having paid the defendant a fee. The plaintiff was playing softball with
other children on a field that the defendant set aside for this purpose.
When one of the children hit the ball, it rolled into a group of bushes
alongside the field. Running into the bushes after the ball, the plaintiff
tripped on a tree root that was covered by a pile of leaves. The tree
root would have been discovered and removed by a reasonable
summer camp operator.

The plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant, alleging that the
defendant's negligence was a proximate cause of injuries that the
plaintiff sustained when she tripped on the tree root. The court should
find for

(A) the defendant, because the tree root was a natural condition of the

land.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff assumed the risk by chasing the

ball into the grove of bushes.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant owed her an absolute duty to

keep the premises safe.

(D) the plaintiff, because a reasonable person in the defendant's
position would have discovered and removed the tree root.

55. The seller owned a 10-acre parcel of realty. On March 6, the seller

offered to sell the land to the buyer for $80,000. The buyer said that he
might be interested but that he would not be in a position to make up
his mind until July. The seller said that she would hold the realty for
the buyer until then and signed a paper on which she wrote:

1116

I  hereby  offer  to  sell  Blackacre  to  the  buyer  for  $80,000  cash.  In
return  for  $1  that  I  have  on  this  date  received,  I  promise  to  hold  this
offer open until July 15.

On July 1, the buyer told the seller that he was ready to purchase the
land, but the seller told him that she had changed her mind and did not
want to sell. The buyer asserted a claim against the seller based on her
written promise to keep the offer open until July 15. At the trial, the
seller proved that she never actually received $1 from the buyer in
return for her promise. In deciding the buyer's claim, the court should
find for

(A) the buyer, because the parol evidence rule prevents the seller from
relying on oral evidence that she did not actually receive $1.

(B) the buyer, because the buyer detrimentally relied on the seller's

promise to keep the offer open until July 15.

(C) the seller, because the realty is obviously worth more than $1.

(D) the seller, because nothing was bargained for or given in exchange

for the seller's promise to keep the offer open until July 15.

56. A woman sued a company in federal district court in State A. She

claimed that she had been injured by one of the company's products and
could no longer work. The company's attorney did not believe the
woman was as injured as she claimed and would like to have the
woman physically examined by a doctor.

What should the company's attorney do?

(A) File notice of request to take a physical examination.

(B) Serve the woman with a notice of deposition.

(C) Obtain a court order requiring the woman to undergo an

examination.

(D) Subpoena the woman to appear at a physical examination.

57. The plaintiff, who was four years of age, was the plaintiff in a battery
action against the defendant, who was seven years of age. At trial, the
plaintiff's attorney called the plaintiff to testify on the plaintiff's direct
case. After interviewing her, the trial judge ruled that because of the
plaintiff's youth, she was unable to appreciate her duty to testify
truthfully and therefore was not a competent witness. The plaintiff's

1117

attorney subsequently called a witness, the plaintiff's neighbor. The
witness testified that, immediately after the incident in question, the
plaintiff had come running up to her on the street, crying and with her
nose bleeding. The witness testified further that at that time the plaintiff
said, “The defendant pushed me and gave me a bloody nose.”

If the defendant's attorney objects to the witness's statement about what
the plaintiff said to her, the court should rule that evidence

(A) admissible as an excited utterance.

(B) admissible because the plaintiff's incompetence to testify made her

a presently unavailable declarant.

(C) inadmissible because it is hearsay.

(D) inadmissible because the plaintiff was incompetent to testify.

58. The plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for injuries that the

plaintiff received when she was struck by a truck owned by the
defendant and driven by one of the defendant's employees. At trial, the
plaintiff's attorney called a woman as a witness on the presentation of
the plaintiff's direct case. In response to questions asked by the
plaintiff's attorney, the witness stated that she was presently employed
by the defendant and that she had been driving the defendant's truck on
the day of the accident. The plaintiff's attorney then asked, “You were
going faster than 35 miles per hour, weren't you?” The defendant's
attorney objected to the question on the ground that it was leading.

If the objection of the defendant's attorney is overruled, it will
probably be because

(A) the witness is employed by an adverse party.

(B) the witness is a hostile witness.

(C) leading questions are permitted on cross-examination.

(D) the question was not leading.

59. The defendant, the owner of a gasoline delivery service, operated a

tank truck for delivering gasoline. The defendant's truck was 35 feet in
length and had the words “DANGER — GASOLINE” printed on it.
One day, while on the way to a gasoline delivery, the defendant
stopped at a bank. Although she saw an official sign that prohibited
parking in that location, the defendant parked her truck directly in front

1118

of the bank. A statute in the jurisdiction prohibited parking any vehicle
longer than 30 feet on a city street. Another statute prohibited parking
any vehicle directly in front of a bank. The defendant was aware of
both statutes.

While the defendant was in the bank, a driver, who was driving down
the street, lost control of her car and struck the defendant's truck. As a
result, a large quantity of gasoline in the defendant's delivery tank
exploded, injuring the driver. The plaintiff, a bank employee who was
sitting at his desk inside the bank, was also injured in the explosion.

The plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for his injuries. If
the plaintiff's claim is successful, it will most likely be because

(A) the statute that prohibited parking vehicles longer than 30 feet on a

city street was a traffic safety statute.

(B) the defendant was aware that a statute prohibited parking any

vehicle in front of a bank.

(C) the reasonable person would not park a vehicle in violation of an

official sign that prohibits parking.

(D) transporting large quantities of gasoline is an abnormally dangerous

activity.

60. A seven-year-old girl was admitted to a hospital unconscious. Doctors

who examined her asked the girl's parents to consent to a blood
transfusion for the girl, stating that the girl would probably die
otherwise. The girl's parents refused, saying that they did not believe in
blood transfusions.

A state statute provides that if a child is admitted to a hospital with a
life-threatening disease or injury, and the parents of that child refuse to
consent to treatment that in the opinion of hospital officials is
necessary to save the child's life, the court shall designate the hospital
administrator to act as the child's guardian for the purpose of
consenting to such treatment. The hospital administrator immediately
commenced a proceeding in a state court to have herself declared the
girl's guardian under that statute. The girl's parents petitioned a federal
court to enjoin the state court from granting the hospital administrator's
application on the ground that the state law is unconstitutional on its
face. Prior to the disposition of either proceeding, the girl died.

1119

If the statute is found to be unconstitutional, it will most likely be
because the statute

(A) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) is vague.

(C) violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

(D) interferes with a fundamental right.

61. After a man died without a will, the state treasurer instituted a

proceeding for a declaration that the man's assets should escheat to the
state, on the ground that there were no living persons eligible to inherit.
A woman opposed the proceeding, claiming that she was the man's
niece and therefore his heir under the state law of intestate distribution.
In support of her claim, the niece offered a Bible. She testified that the
Bible had belonged to her deceased mother, and that her mother had
made notations in it indicating that her husband, the niece's father, was
the man's brother, and indicating the date of birth of her daughter, the
niece. The state treasurer objected to admission of the Bible.

If the notation in the Bible is admitted into evidence, it will probably
be as

(A) an ancient document.

(B) a statement of the mother's personal history or pedigree.

(C) a transaction recorded under the “dead man's statute.”

(D) a record of vital statistics.

62. The defendant and his friend agreed to rob a bank and planned the

robbery for several weeks. According to their plan, the defendant's car
would be used as the getaway vehicle. The defendant was to drive to
and from the robbery and wait in the car while his friend went into the
bank to hold it up. While driving to the bank with his friend on the day
the robbery was to take place, however, the defendant began to have
second thoughts. After a brief conversation with his friend, the
defendant stopped the car. Taking his car keys with him, he told his
friend he wasn't going through with it and went into a store, where he
telephoned the police and told them about the planned robbery. While
the defendant was in the store, his friend left and robbed the bank
himself. The information provided by the defendant's call led to the
apprehension and conviction of his friend.

1120

If the defendant is subsequently arrested and prosecuted for conspiracy
to commit bank robbery, he should be found

(A) not guilty, because he removed his keys from the car when he got

out to phone the police.

(B) not guilty, because he notified his friend that he had changed his

mind about going through with the plan.

(C) not guilty, because the defendant's telephone call to the police led

to the apprehension and conviction of his friend.

(D) guilty.

63. The defendant was the owner and operator of a hotel. Because
electrical wiring in the hotel was beginning to deteriorate, the
defendant hired a licensed electrician to repair it. The electrician was
hired as an independent contractor. If the defendant had done any
investigation regarding the electrician, he would have discovered many
complaints and citations regarding poor work done by the electrician.
While repairing the wiring, the electrician negligently connected the
wiring in room 201 to a dangerous high-voltage supply line instead of
to a safe low-voltage supply line. Reasonable inspection by the
defendant would not have disclosed the error. The following day, when
the plaintiff registered at the hotel, the defendant assigned him to room
201. That evening, while the plaintiff was attempting to adjust the
electric heater in room 201, he received a severe electric shock as a
result of the fact that the room had been connected to a high-voltage
supply line.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damage
resulting from the electric shock, the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the defendant hired the electrician as an

independent contractor.

(B) the defendant, because reasonable inspection by the defendant

would have failed to disclose the electrician's error.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant failed to use adequate care in

hiring the electrician.

(D) the plaintiff, because the electrician's error made the wiring in

room 201 ultra-hazardous.

64. When the landowner's mother died, she left him a 640-acre parcel of

1121

realty known as the Smith and Baker tract. Soon afterwards, the
landowner executed a general warranty deed to his sister, conveying
realty described as “the north 40 of the parcel of land known as the
Smith and Baker tract.” The landowner thereafter executed a quitclaim
deed in favor of his wife to “all my rights, title, and interest in a parcel
of realty known as the Smith and Baker tract.” The Smith and Baker
tract was a famous piece of land in the area, and was easily
identifiable by its name. However, the jurisdiction was one in which
reference to government survey markers was customarily used in
describing realty in general warranty deeds. If the wife subsequently
institutes a proceeding against the sister seeking to declare herself the
owner of the entire Smith and Baker tract, should the court grant the
relief requested by the wife?

(A) No, because one who executes a quitclaim deed does not warrant

that he or she holds any interest in the property described.

(B) No, because the description in the landowner's deed to the sister
was reasonably sufficient to identify the property conveyed.

(C) Yes, because the jurisdiction is one in which reference to

government survey markers is customarily used in describing realty
in general warranty deeds.

(D) Yes, because a deed that conveys a portion of a parcel of realty

must describe the portion conveyed in terms of “metes and bounds”
or other survey terminology.

65. A newspaper published an article stating that the plaintiff had once

been convicted of armed robbery. In fact, the plaintiff had never been
convicted of any crime. If the plaintiff asserts a defamation claim
against the newspaper, which one of the following additional facts or
inferences, if it was the only one true, would be most likely to result in
a judgment for the newspaper?

(A) Official government records indicating that the plaintiff had never

been convicted of robbery were available for public inspection.

(B) Officials of the newspaper responsible for publishing the article

reasonably believed the statement to be true.

(C) The plaintiff was a public figure.

(D) The plaintiff failed to prove that damage resulted from the

statement.

1122

66. A woman was the owner of a house in which she lived with her 23-

year-old son, the defendant. After receiving a tip that the defendant was
involved in the unlawful sale of drugs, two police officers went to the
woman's home for the purpose of questioning the defendant. When they
arrived, the defendant was not in, but the woman admitted them to the
house. The officers explained why they had come and asked whether
they could see the defendant's room. The woman showed them to the
defendant's room and permitted them to enter, saying that the defendant
never locked his door. When the officers saw a footlocker in the room,
they asked the woman whether they could look inside it. She told them
that the defendant was the only one who had a key to the footlocker, but
she said if they could find some way to open it, she had no objection to
their looking inside. While the woman watched, one of the officers
picked the lock and opened the footlocker. In it, they found a plastic
bag containing cocaine. The officers left the plastic bag there and
returned later with a search warrant that they obtained by swearing that
they had seen cocaine in the defendant's footlocker. After seizing the
cocaine, they arrested the defendant for unlawful possession of a
dangerous drug. Prior to trial, the defendant asked the court to suppress
use of the cocaine as evidence.

The defendant's motion should be

(A) denied, because the woman gave the police permission to open the

footlocker.

(B) denied, because the woman had apparent authority to permit the

search of the defendant's room.

(C) granted.

(D) denied, because the officers had probable cause to believe that they

would find cocaine in the footlocker.

67. After negotiation, the buyer and the seller entered into a valid written
contract for the sale to the buyer of the seller's realty. The contract
provided for closing of title “on or before June 15” because the buyer
was moving into the area on June 15 and needed to move into the realty
immediately. The contract also stated that “time is of the essence.” On
June 12, the seller informed the buyer that she would not be able to
close until June 16. On June 16, the seller tendered a conveyance.
Although the seller complied with the requirements of the contract in
all other respects, the buyer refused to accept the conveyance on the

1123

ground that the date for performance had passed.

If the seller asserts a claim against the buyer as a result of the buyer's
refusal to accept the seller's conveyance on June 16, the court should
find for

(A) the buyer, because circumstances contemplated by the parties at the
time the contract was formed made it essential that the conveyance
occur on or before June 15.

(B) the buyer, because the contract contained the phrase “time is of the

essence.”

(C) the seller, because there was no indication that a conveyance after

June 15 would cause damages to the buyer.

(D) the seller, because she made a reasonable effort to comply with the

terms of the contract.

68. The defendant was the manufacturer of a gas sold for commercial use.
The defendant produced the gas at its factory and stored it in a large
tank located behind the factory building. Although the defendant made
reasonable inspections of its storage tank at reasonable intervals, a
leak in the tank allowed some gas to escape. A wind carried the
escaped gas to the home of the plaintiff, located a half-mile from the
defendant's factory. The plaintiff died as a result of his exposure to the
gas.

In a strict liability claim against the defendant for damages resulting
from the plaintiff's exposure to gas, which of the following must the
plaintiff's personal representative prove to prevail?

(A) The tank in which the defendant stored the gas was defective.

(B) The gas was defectively designed.

(C) The gas was defectively manufactured.

(D) The gas is extremely deadly.

69. After a man died in a plane crash, the man's family sued the airline in
federal district court. The family's attorney hired an expert in airplane
accidents to create a model of the man's accident. Based on his
research, the expert planned to testify that the accident was caused by
pilot negligence.

1124

The airline's attorney would like to know the details of the expert's
research before trial. How may the airline's attorney do so?

(A) The airline's attorney doesn't have to do anything to learn the

details of the expert's research.

(B) The airline's attorney may serve interrogatories on the expert.

(C) The airline's attorney may depose the expert.

(D) The airline's attorney may not know the details of the expert's

research because it is protected work product.

70. The plaintiff asserted a negligence claim against the defendant for
personal injuries sustained when the plaintiff fell down a stairway
while leaving the defendant's restaurant. The defendant asserted a
defense of contributory negligence. At trial, the defendant's attorney
called a witness. After answering several preliminary questions, the
witness testified that she observed the plaintiff leaving the restaurant
just before the accident and that the plaintiff appeared to be
intoxicated. The witness said she based her opinion on the fact she
heard the plaintiff slurring her words and the plaintiff appeared to
almost walk into a wall. The plaintiff's attorney objected, and the judge
found that the witness's opinion appeared to be rationally based on the
witness's personal perceptions. The witness's statement that the
plaintiff appeared to be intoxicated should be

(A) admitted.

(B) excluded, because the witness is not an expert on intoxication.

(C) admitted, but the judge should instruct the jury to disregard it unless

the jury decides that the witness is an expert on intoxication.

(D) admitted, but the judge should instruct the jury to disregard it unless
the jury decides that the witness's opinion is rationally based on
her personal perceptions.

71. The Department of Sanitation was established for the purpose of

providing free sanitation services to the people of the state. Since its
inception, the Department's activities have included garbage collection
and street cleaning. The plaintiff, an alien residing within the state,
applied for a job as a Director of Public Policy with the Department of
Sanitation. The Director had broad discretion regarding policies in the
Department of Sanitation. Although he qualified in all other respects,
the state Personnel Division rejected the plaintiff's application on the

1125

sole ground that he was not a United States citizen. A statute of the state
provides in part that “no person shall be eligible for employment as
Director of Public Policy in the Department of Sanitation who is not a
citizen of the United States.” The plaintiff challenged the
constitutionality of that statute in an appropriate proceeding.

The statute should be found constitutional

(A) because street cleaning is a traditional government activity in the

state.

(B) because there is a rational basis for restricting employment by the

state to citizens of the United States.

(C) because the job the plaintiff applied for appears to involve policy-
making functions and includes broad discretion in the execution of
public policy.

(D) unless employment by the state is found to be a fundamental right.

72. A shoe company sued an athlete in federal district court in State A. The

case was tried in front of a jury.

Which of the following statements is correct?

(A) The jury must have at least five members.

(B) The jury can have no more than nine members.

(C) A jury can hear the case if the company seeks an injunction.

(D) The jury verdict must be unanimous.

73. A woman, a citizen of State A, sued a company for violations of the

federal National Labor Relations Act in federal district court in State
A. The company was incorporated in State B and had most of its
factories in State A (including the factory where the woman's claim
arose). The company president and most of its decision-makers
worked in an office in State C just across the border from State B. The
woman claimed $80,000 in damages.

Does the federal district court in State A have subject matter
jurisdiction over the claim?

(A) No, because most of the company's factories are in State A.

(B) No, because the woman's claim arose from a company factory in

1126

State A.

(C) Yes, because the woman is suing under the National Labor

Relations Act.

(D) Yes, because the company president and most of its decision-

makers work in an office in State C.

74. The defendant kept a pet cougar in a yard that was surrounded by a
wire chain-link fence. The plaintiff, who lived in the vicinity,
frequently walked on the public sidewalk adjacent to the defendant's
yard. One day, while the plaintiff was standing on the public sidewalk
looking at the cougar through the defendant's fence, the cougar sprang
toward the plaintiff. Because the fence was badly deteriorated, it
collapsed under the cougar's weight and fell on the plaintiff, inflicting
serious injuries. The defendant knew the fence was in need of repair.

If the plaintiff asserts a negligence claim against the defendant as a
result of her injuries, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the keeping of a wild animal is prima facie

negligent.

(B) the plaintiff, because a reasonable person in the defendant's

position would have repaired the fence.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant knew that the fence was in need

of repair.

(D) the defendant, because the plaintiff assumed the risk by standing by

the fence and looking at the cougar.

75. On March 1, a farmer entered into a written contract with the worker.
By its terms, the worker agreed to plow the farmer's fields by April 1,
using the worker's own tractor. In return, the farmer promised to pay
$2,000 upon completion of the work. On March 25, while the worker
was plowing the farmer's field, her tractor broke down. The worker
informed the farmer that because the tractor needed extensive repairs,
it would be impossible to finish the job by April 1 unless she rented
another tractor. The worker said that she could rent one for $600, but
she would not do so unless the farmer agreed to add the rental charge
to the worker's fee for preparing the field. The farmer agreed without
complaint, afraid that the value of his crop would be reduced if the
field was not plowed in time. The worker returned to work after
renting a tractor for $600.

1127

After the worker finished plowing the farmer's field, however, the
farmer refused to pay her any more than $2,000.

If the worker asserts a claim against the farmer on account of the
farmer's promise to pay an additional $600 for the rental of a tractor,
which of the following would be the farmer's most effective argument
in defense?

(A) The farmer's promise to pay for the tractor rental was not in

writing.

(B) The farmer's promise to pay for the tractor rental was unsupported

by consideration.

(C) The farmer's promise to pay for the tractor rental was induced by

economic duress.

(D) The farmer detrimentally relied on the worker's original promise to
complete plowing of the field by April 1 at a price of $2,000.

76. A landowner conveyed a parcel of land “to my son for life, remainder
to my daughter.” Two years later, without the landowner's permission,
the son quitclaimed all of his interest in the land to his wife.

What is the state of the land's title?

(A) Life estate in daughter, remainder in fee simple to landowner.

(B) Fee simple absolute in daughter.

(C) Life estate per autre vie in wife, remainder in fee simple in

daughter.

(D) Life estate in wife, remainder in fee simple in daughter.

77. A man went to a car dealer. The dealer showed him a car that he said

was “brand new.” The man checked the odometer, which showed it had
been driven 10 miles, and checked the interior and engine, which
looked new. After the man bought the car for $2,000 less than the
suggested list price, he discovered the car was actually a used car that
had been completely submerged in a flood. On further investigation, he
learned the car dealer had rolled back the odometer back from 10,000
miles and had covered up the flood damage with paint.

What crime, if any, can the car dealer be charged with?

(A) Larceny by trick.

1128

(B) False pretenses.

(C) Embezzlement.

(D) No crime.

78. In determining what law to apply in a case brought in federal court
based on diversity, which of the following statements is incorrect?

(A) A court of appeals should defer to a district court's decision

regarding unsettled state law.

(B) A district court should apply the substantive law of the state in

which it sits.

(C) A district court should apply federal procedural law.

(D) A district court should apply the statute of limitations rules of the

state in which it sits.

79. A police officer was walking by a home when he heard screaming. The
officer ran to the front door, announced himself, and then entered the
house. When he went into the kitchen, the officer saw a large amount of
cocaine and a scale sitting in an open kitchen cupboard. He placed
both of the men under arrest.

At their trial for drug crimes, the men argued that the court should
suppress the evidence against them because their arrests were the
result of a warrantless search. What result?

(A) The evidence should be suppressed because the warrantless entry

violated the men's Fourth Amendment rights.

(B) The evidence should not be suppressed because the officer could
enter the premises without a warrant based on the plain view
doctrine.

(C) The evidence should not be suppressed because there were exigent

circumstances supporting the officer's warrantless entry.

(D) The evidence should not be suppressed because there was

probable cause for the officer to enter the premises to make the
arrests.

80. A lumber supplier entered into a contract with a new home builder.
The contract stated that the builder would purchase all the wood
required by the builder for new homes he was building in 2013, but

1129

that in no event would the amount be less than 20,000 board-feet of
wood. In making the agreement, neither party contemplated a decline in
new home starts. After the agreement, new home starts fell
dramatically. As a result, the builder informed the supplier he would
not be ordering any wood in 2013.

The supplier sued the builder for damages. At trial, the builder tried to
testify that in the home-building industry it was generally understood
that minimum requirements set forth in contracts for the supply of
wood were of no effect when new home starts fell dramatically. The
supplier objected. Should the builder's testimony be admitted?

(A) Yes, because evidence of a regularly observed business practice
may be offered to explain the terms of a written agreement.

(B) No, because the written agreement was intended by the parties to

be a final expression of their agreement.

(C) No, because the parties did not contemplate a decline in new home

starts.

(D) No, because the fact that the parties specified a minimum

requirement of 20,000 board-feet shows that they did not intend to
be bound by any preexisting industry standards.

81. A local newspaper published an editorial claiming that the majority of
firefighters at the local fire department were dangerously out of shape
and had recently failed their physicals. Following publication, several
firefighters sued the newspaper for defamation.

All parties agree that the newspaper lacked actual malice in making
the statement and that this is the only defense raised by the newspaper.
Which of the following arguments would be most likely to result in a
judgment for the newspaper?

(A) There is no such thing as a false idea.

(B) The plaintiffs were in a position of apparent control over public

affairs.

(C) The editorial and resulting lawsuit made the public familiar with

the plaintiffs.

(D) The plaintiffs were public employees.

82. The plaintiff, a manufacturer of police equipment, obtained a patent for

1130

a bulletproof vest made entirely of recycled aluminum cans. On April
1, a police department entered into a written contract with the plaintiff
providing for the purchase and sale of 30 of the plaintiff's bulletproof
vests per month for the next year at a specified price. For the following
three months, both parties performed as required by the agreement. On
July 5, soon after the third delivery, the plaintiff's only factory burned
completely to the ground without any fault on the part of the plaintiff.
On July 10, officials of the police department wrote to the plaintiff,
asking whether the plaintiff would continue to deliver as agreed. When
the plaintiff failed to respond within a reasonable time, the police
department entered into an agreement with another company for the
purchase of 30 bulletproof vests per month.

After the police department contracted with another company for the
purchase of bulletproof vests, the plaintiff delivered 30 bulletproof
vests to the police department, but the police department refused to
accept them. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the police
department for breach of contract, which of the following would be the
police department's most effective argument in defense against that
claim?

(A) The destruction of the plaintiff's factory reasonably appeared to

frustrate the purpose of the contract between the police department
and the plaintiff.

(B) The plaintiff's failure to respond to the police department's letter of

July 10 resulted in a prospective inability to perform.

(C) The plaintiff's contract with the police department was divisible.

(D) The police department's contract to purchase bulletproof vests from

another company was a repudiation of its contract with the
plaintiff.

83. A group of teenagers hired a stretch limousine for their prom. While

driving to the prom, the limousine driver saw a dog crossing the road
in front of the vehicle. He swerved to avoid it and ended up crashing
into a tree. Several of the teenagers were injured. A state statute
required that all limousine drivers carry at least a $100,000 minimum
accident liability policy. The limousine driver was uninsured. If the
limousine driver is found liable for the teenagers' injuries, it will be

(A) under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, because an accident like

this would not normally occur without negligence.

1131

(B) under the doctrine of negligence per se, because the driver

violated the state insurance statute.

(C) because his conduct in swerving to avoid the dog was

unreasonable.

(D) because he owed a special duty to the teenagers in his care.

84. At the defendant's trial on criminal charges, undisputed evidence
established that the defendant and his friend had planned to take a
certain coat from the victim's shop by threatening the victim with a
pistol carried by the friend; that when they did so, the victim began
shooting at them; and that the friend shot back with his pistol,
intentionally killing the victim.

Testifying on behalf of the prosecution, the friend stated that the
defendant knew that the friend's pistol would be loaded. He also stated
that the victim had handed the defendant the coat; that the friend had
returned his own gun to his pocket; and that he and the defendant were
on their way out of the victim's shop when the victim began shooting at
them.

The defendant testified that the coat in question had previously been
stolen from her by the victim, and that she and the friend were trying to
retrieve it.

Statutes in the jurisdiction define first degree murder as the intentional
unlawful killing of a human being, and second degree murder as the
unintentional killing of a human being by the defendant or an
accomplice during the course of a burglary, robbery, rape, kidnapping,
or arson committed by the defendant.

The jury believes the testimony of the defendant but does not believe
the testimony of the friend. Which of the following would be the
defendant's most effective argument in defense against a charge of
second degree murder?

(A) It was unforeseeable that the victim would begin shooting.

(B) The defendant did not know that the friend's pistol would be

loaded.

(C) The victim's death did not occur during the course of one of the

1132

crimes specified in the applicable statute.

(D) The statute was not intended to impose criminal liability on one

person for the acts of another.

85. On February 1, the landowner conveyed a parcel of realty to his cousin
as a gift. The landowner executed the deed in the presence of a notary
public, and the notary affixed his seal as required by law. On March 1,
after the landowner learned that his cousin had not recorded his title,
the landowner purported to convey the same parcel of realty to his
barber for value. The barber was unaware that the landowner's cousin
held any interest in the realty. On March 15, the landowner's cousin
recorded the deed that he had received from the landowner in
February. On March 17, the barber recorded his deed. In June, the
barber executed a deed conveying the realty to the notary. The notary
immediately recorded the deed.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “Every conveyance of real
estate which shall not be recorded is void as against any subsequent
purchaser of the same real estate in good faith and for a valuable
consideration whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.” In
litigation between the landowner's cousin and the notary, who should
be declared owner of the realty?

(A) The notary, because the landowner's cousin did not purchase the

realty from the landowner for value.

(B) The notary, because the barber recorded his deed prior to

conveying the realty to the notary.

(C) The landowner's cousin, because the barber recorded his deed after

the landowner's cousin recorded his deed.

(D) The landowner's cousin, because any recording by the barber was

outside the chain of title.

86. One night, the defendant looked out his window and saw a robber

taking something from his garage. The defendant went outside with a
pistol and saw that the robber was already backing down the
defendant's driveway in his getaway car. The defendant yelled, “Stop
or I'll shoot you right through the windshield!” The robber stopped and
started to get out of the car with a large axe in his hand. Before the
robber could get to his feet, the defendant shot the robber in the head,
killing him instantly. The defendant was charged with manslaughter. At

1133

trial, the defendant claimed he acted in self-defense. If the defendant is
found guilty of manslaughter, it will because

(A) the harm being defended against was not reasonably imminent.

(B) the defendant used more force than necessary.

(C) the robber had already withdrawn.

(D) the defendant provoked the robber.

87. A man's brother went away for a week on business. The man agreed to
stay in his brother's apartment to watch his dogs. While he was staying
in the apartment, he smoked marijuana several times. The neighbors
called the police to complain about the marijuana smell and told the
police the owner was away. The police went to the apartment and
knocked on the door. When the man answered the door, the police
forced their way in. Once they entered the apartment, they immediately
saw a large amount of marijuana on the kitchen table and arrested the
man. At trial, the man argued that the search of the apartment was
unlawful and the marijuana should be suppressed.

How should the court rule?

(A) The evidence should be suppressed, because the man was staying

at the apartment for a week.

(B) The evidence should not be suppressed, because the police officers

saw the marijuana in plain view.

(C) The evidence should not be suppressed, because the neighbors

smelled the marijuana.

(D) The evidence should not be suppressed, because the man did not

own the apartment.

88. The landowner was the owner of a parcel of realty on which there

were several buildings and a gold mine. The landowner lived in one of
the buildings and personally worked the gold mine, earning a
comfortable living by selling the gold that he removed. The other
buildings were vacant. When the landowner died, his will devised the
realty “to my best friend, but if my best friend should die without issue
from his wife, to my accountant.” Soon after the landlord's death, the
landowner's friend entered into a contract with a mining company.
Pursuant to the contract, the company was to work the gold mine for 10
years and to pay the landowner's friend 50 percent of the gross

1134

proceeds from the sale of gold removed from the mine. In addition, the
landowner's friend leased all the buildings on the realty to the company
for 10 years for use by the company employees as living quarters. He
never had any children with his wife.

His wife died two years later, and the accountant then demanded that
the landowner's friend pay the accountant all funds that the friend
would subsequently receive from the company as proceeds of the
company's gold mining operation on the realty and as rent on the
buildings. The accountant is entitled to receive

(A) proceeds of the gold mining operation only.

(B) rent on the buildings only.

(C) proceeds of the gold mining operation and rent on the buildings.

(D) neither the proceeds of the gold mining operation nor rent on the

buildings.

89. A concert promoter sued a rock singer for breach of contract in federal
district court after the rock singer failed to perform at a charity concert
in State A. The federal district court ruled in favor of the rock singer,
finding his signature had been forged on the contract. The concert
promoter appealed, arguing the signature was really the rock singer's.

What standard of review should the appellate court use?

(A) De novo, because the validity of the signature is a question of law.

(B) Clearly erroneous, because the validity of the signature is a

question of fact.

(C) Abuse of discretion, because the validity of the signature is a

question of law.

(D) Abuse of discretion, because the validity of the signature is a

question of fact.

90. At the defendant's trial on a charge of rape, the victim testified that on
March 1, the defendant forced her to have sexual intercourse with him
against her will. Testifying in his own defense, the defendant admitted
that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim on that date,
but he claimed that the victim had consented. The defendant stated
further that the victim had not accused him of rape until April 3, when
she discovered that he was married and was living with his wife.

1135

The prosecutor subsequently called the victim's neighbor to the stand.
The neighbor testified that while she was conversing with the victim
on March 7, the victim suddenly burst into tears and told her that she
had been raped by the defendant a week before. Upon objection by the
defendant's attorney, the neighbor's statement should be

(A) admitted, because the victim's statement was an excited utterance.

(B) excluded, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

(C) admitted, because it contradicts the defendant's claim that the

victim did not accuse him of rape until she learned that he was
married.

(D) admitted, because the victim's statement was a present sense

impression.

91. A woman was the owner of a parcel of realty on which she lived with
her husband. The woman was admitted to a hospital following a severe
heart attack. While her husband was visiting her in the hospital, the
woman said, “I know I'm dying, and I want to be sure that you have the
land after I'm gone. Please have our lawyer take care of it.” The
following day, the husband asked the family attorney to prepare a
quitclaim deed to the land for execution by the woman. The husband
brought the document to the woman in the hospital, where she executed
it according to the requirements of law. After signing the quitclaim
deed, the woman handed the document to the husband and said, “Please
put it in the safe deposit box at the bank.” The husband did so but never
recorded the quitclaim.

The woman subsequently recovered from her heart attack and was
moved from the hospital to a rest home, where she resided until 30
years later, when she died from other causes. At the woman's request,
the husband continued to occupy, maintain, and pay taxes on the land
throughout that period of time. During the last nine years of her life in
the rest home, the woman was attended by a nurse. When the woman
died, her will purported to leave the land “to my faithful nurse.” The
husband and the nurse subsequently asserted conflicting claims to the
land.

Which of the following arguments would be most likely to lead to a
judgment for the nurse?

(A) The husband did not record the quitclaim.

1136

(B) A quitclaim deed is relevant only in disputes between grantor and

grantee.

(C) No warranties of seisin or quiet enjoyment are created by a

quitclaim deed.

(D) The woman did not intend for the quitclaim to be effective until

after her death.

92. A boy decided to play a prank on his babysitter. He took one of his

play swords and swung it at his babysitter's head, acting like he was
going to hit her (although he had no intention of doing so). The
babysitter raised her arms in defense. At the same moment, the boy's
little sister walked out of the bathroom, saw her brother swinging the
sword, and ducked, thinking she was about to be hit by the sword. Due
to a manufacturing defect in the sword, the blade flew off and struck
the babysitter in the head. Which statement is most correct?

(A) The boy could not be held liable for battery of the babysitter

because he did not have the necessary intent.

(B) The boy's sister could claim assault under the doctrine of

transferred intent.

(C) Since the boy only intended to frighten the babysitter, he did not

have the necessary intent for assault.

(D) Because the boy did not bear malice or hostility toward the

babysitter, he could not be held liable for battery.

93. On March 1, the buyer, a well-known collector of antique automobiles,
mailed to a newspaper an advertisement that read, in part: “I will pay
$100 for information leading to purchase of an antique car.” On March
2, before the advertisement appeared in the newspaper and without
knowing about it, the seller phoned the buyer collect and offered to sell
him an antique car. The advertisement was published on March 3.

On March 3, a man saw the advertisement and remembered meeting
someone who owned an antique car. After calling a few friends, the
man obtained the owner's name and address and mailed it to the buyer
with a request for the $100 reward.

On March 4, the buyer looked at the seller's antique car and purchased
it. Later that day, the buyer mailed to the newspaper for publication a
second advertisement that in part read: “No reward for antique car. I

1137

hereby withdraw my previous request for information about an antique
car.” The second advertisement did not appear in the newspaper until
March 6.

On March 5, the buyer received the man's letter, but discarded it
because he had purchased the seller's antique car.

If the man asserts a claim against the buyer for $100, the court should
find for

(A) the buyer, because he mailed the second advertisement before

receiving the man's letter.

(B) the buyer, because the man's letter did not lead to the purchase of an

antique car.

(C) the man, because he mailed the letter to the buyer before the buyer

purchased an antique car.

(D) the man, because the buyer received the man's letter before the

second advertisement was published.

94. A man who suffered from severe skin allergies purchased a topical

cream online. A statute required the drug manufacturer to insert into the
cream's packaging a warning of its potential adverse side effects. The
manufacturer failed to insert an appropriate warning of a particular
side effect, skin discoloration, into the cream's packaging. The man
used the cream for several months until his skin began to turn a dark
blue color. Even though the man continued to use the cream, the man
sued. At trial, the man testified that neither he nor anyone in his
household ever read warnings that accompanied drugs.

How should the court rule?

(A) In favor of the manufacturer, because no one in the man's household

read drug warnings.

(B) In favor of the manufacturer, because the man continued to use the

cream.

(C) In favor of the man, because the manufacturer violated the statute by

failing to include the warning.

(D) In favor of the man, because the type of harm caused could have

been avoided by an adequate warning.

1138

95. A seven-year-old girl was admitted to a hospital unconscious. Doctors

who examined her asked the girl's parents to consent to a blood
transfusion for the girl, stating that the girl would probably die
otherwise. The girl's parents refused, saying that they did not believe in
blood transfusions.

A state statute provides that if a child is admitted to a hospital with a
life-threatening disease or injury, and the parents of that child refuse to
consent to treatment that in the opinion of hospital officials is
necessary to save the child's life, the court shall designate the hospital
administrator to act as the child's guardian for the purpose of
consenting to such treatment. The hospital administrator immediately
commenced a proceeding in a state court to have herself declared the
girl's guardian under that statute. The girl's parents petitioned a federal
court to enjoin the state court from granting the hospital administrator's
application on the ground that the state law is unconstitutional on its
face. Prior to the disposition of either proceeding, the girl died.

If the proceeding instituted by the girl's parents is dismissed, it will
most likely be because

(A) the girl's death has turned the controversy into a non-justiciable

political question.

(B) the girl's death has made the proceeding moot.

(C) the court lacks jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment.

(D) the issues are not ripe since the highest state court has not yet ruled

on the constitutionality of the statute.

96. Because of a deficit in the city budget, the city institutes a “pay-to-

throw” system where people must buy special trash bags if they want
to throw out their trash. The bags cost $2 a piece, and are burdensome
on low-income families. If a person or organization with standing
challenges the new system, its constitutionality will be based on

(A) whether the new system has a rational basis.

(B) whether it is necessary to serve a compelling interest of the state.

(C) whether it is found to interfere with a fundamental right.

(D) whether it is found to discriminate against a discrete class of

persons.

1139

97. A man was at the beach when he saw a small dog being washed out to
sea. He jumped into the ocean and rescued the dog. As soon as the man
and the dog were back on the beach, the dog's owner ran up to the man
and said, “That's my prize show dog! I promise to pay you $1,000 for
rescuing him!” The man accepted. In celebration, the man bought
himself a new motorcycle on credit based on his expected reward
money. Several months passed, and the man called the dog's owner to
ask when he might be paid so he could pay off the motorcycle. The dog
owner refused to pay the $1,000 he had promised, claiming it was
unsupported by any consideration. Which of the following would be
the man's most effective argument in support of his claim?

(A) The dog owner's promise was given in exchange for the man's

rescue of his dog.

(B) The dog owner was morally obligated to compensate the man for

rescuing his dog.

(C) Allowing the dog owner to avoid compensating the man for
rescuing the dog would unjustly enrich the dog owner.

(D) The man detrimentally relied on the dog owner's promise by buying

the motorcycle.

98. At the defendant's trial for murder, the prosecution proved that the

defendant was driving while intoxicated when his car struck another
car, killing all its occupants. The defendant appealed his conviction for
voluntary manslaughter.

Which of the cases below is most applicable as precedent?

(A) Believing that the victim was attacking her, the defendant swung a
tennis racket at the victim, hoping to frighten the victim away but
not meaning to strike the victim with it. The tennis racket struck the
victim in the head, causing his death. At the defendant's trial, over
the defendant's objection, the judge instructed the jury to find the
defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter if the force used by the
defendant was excessive. The defendant's conviction for
involuntary manslaughter was affirmed.

(B) The defendant's wife was admitted to the intensive care unit of a

hospital following an automobile accident. While visiting her, the
defendant overheard doctors saying that there was no hope of
saving the life of a certain patient who would be in intense pain

1140

and paralyzed for as long as she lived. Mistakenly believing that
they were talking about his wife, the defendant subsequently
smothered her to death with a pillow while she was asleep in the
hospital bed. The defendant was convicted of murder after the
court refused to charge the jury that if the defendant believed that
his wife was hopelessly ill and in intense pain, they could find him
guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The defendant's conviction for
murder was reversed.

(C) While the defendant was robbing a tavern, the bartender attempted

to grab the defendant's gun. During the struggle, the gun
accidentally went off, seriously injuring the bartender. At the
defendant's trial for attempted murder, the court instructed the jury
to return a verdict of not guilty if they found that the defendant did
not intend to cause the bartender's death. The defendant's acquittal
was affirmed.

(D) After the defendant quarreled with her lover, she fired a gun at him
while he was with his wife. The bullet missed the defendant's lover
but struck and killed his wife. At the defendant's trial, it was
established that she fired with the intention of frightening both her
lover and his wife, but that she did not mean to strike either of
them. The defendant was convicted of murder after the court
refused to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter. The
conviction was affirmed.

99. After receiving a warrant, police officers went to the defendant's

address to arrest him. They arrested the defendant on the street outside
his residence and placed him in a police car. The officers then knocked
on the front door of the house, and the defendant's girlfriend answered.
She gave the officers consent to search a back bedroom she shared
with the defendant “most of the time.” Inside the bedroom, the officers
found drugs and guns.

At trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence on the grounds
that his girlfriend had no authority to search the bedroom. How should
the court rule?

(A) Grant the motion, because the girlfriend only shared the bedroom

“most of the time.”

(B) Grant the motion, because by her statements it was clear she was

not the owner of the property.

1141

(C) Deny the motion, because the girlfriend had joint authority over the

bedroom.

(D) Deny the motion, because the police could reasonably believe she

could give consent to search the bedroom.

100. A buyer signed a sales contract to buy a new house from the seller. The
contract stated that it was “subject to and conditional upon the buyer
obtaining a 30-year mortgage from a bank or other lending institution
in the amount of $200,000 at an interest rate of less than 2 percent.”
The buyer went to several banks in the area, but no bank would lend
him the money at an interest rate of less than 2 percent. The seller
offered to set up a private financing plan between the two parties that
would bring the interest rate down to less than 2 percent for the buyer
over the course of the loan. The buyer refused to close the deal. The
seller argued that with the private financing in place, the net result of
the loan was the same and the contract should be enforced.

What is the result of the buyer's failure to obtain an interest rate of less
than 2 percent?

(A) The buyer is discharged from his duty to close the sale.

(B) Since the net result of the private financing is the same, the buyer is

required to close the sale.

(C) The seller can sue the buyer for specific performance to complete

the sale.

(D) The seller can sue the buyer for any damages he suffered under the
contract due to the buyer's failure to obtain a loan at less than 2
percent interest.

101. The homeowner, who owned a home in a residential development,

decided to have his driveway paved. He called the plaintiff, a licensed
contractor who specialized in residential driveways, and asked for an
estimate on the job. Although the standard market price to pave a
driveway the size of the homeowner's was $2,750, the plaintiff was
willing to do the job for $2,500 since business was slow. The
homeowner agreed to hire him to do the job at that price and filled out
and signed a detailed work order for the plaintiff's work crew. Since
the 
homeowner was planning to go on vacation for two weeks, he and the
plaintiff agreed that the job would be finished by the time the
homeowner returned.

Three days later, the plaintiff's work crew went out to do the job
described in the homeowner's work order. By mistake, they paved the
neighbor's driveway, which was identical to the homeowner's except
that it was on a different street. The neighbor was out of town at the
time. The job cost the plaintiff $2,600 in labor and materials and
increased the value of the neighbor's realty by $2,100. The homeowner
did not communicate with the plaintiff while away on vacation. When
he returned and discovered that his driveway had not yet been paved,
he demanded that the plaintiff perform as agreed, but the plaintiff
refused.

The plaintiff asserts a claim against the neighbor on a quasi-contract
theory. If the plaintiff is successful, he is entitled to

(A) $2,100 (the increase in the value of the neighbor's realty).

(B) $2,500 (the agreed price in the contract between the plaintiff and

the homeowner).

1143

(C) $2,600 (the plaintiff's cost in paving the neighbor's driveway).

(D) $2,750 (the standard price of the paving job).

102. The plaintiff and the defendant, both residents of the state, entered into
an installment contract for the sale of goods. When a dispute arose
between them under the contract, the plaintiff asserted a claim for
$52,000 against the defendant in a United States district court in the
state. The defendant moved to dismiss the claim on jurisdictional
grounds. A state statute grants concurrent state and federal jurisdiction
over contract disputes, and a federal statute grants jurisdiction to hear
such a claim to the United States district court.

Did the United States district court have jurisdiction to adjudicate the
claim?

(A) Yes, because a statute of the state grants concurrent state and

federal jurisdiction over contract disputes.

(B) Yes, because a federal statute 

grants jurisdiction to hear such a claim to the United States district
court.

(C) No, under Article III of the United States Constitution.

(D) No, under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States

Constitution.

103. The company was a major corporation with shares of stock traded on
several stock exchanges. When rumors began to circulate that the
company was experiencing financial difficulties, the price of the
company stock fell drastically. The reporter was a journalist who
wrote a financial news column for a daily newspaper.

One day, while the reporter was discussing the company rumor with
her friend, the friend said, “I wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing
was some kind of stunt to manipulate the price of stock.” The reporter
was aware that the friend knew nothing about the stock market or about
the company. The following day, based solely upon what she had
heard from the friend, the reporter made the following statement in her
column:

Don't be fooled by rumors that the company is in trouble. Insiders say
that  the  whole  thing  is  a  stunt  to  manipulate  the  price  of  the  stock.  I
say the company is still a good investment.

1144

After reading the column, the plaintiff invested in the company's stock
in reliance on the reporter's statement. Two days later, the company
filed a petition in bankruptcy, and its stock became worthless. If the
plaintiff asserts a claim against the reporter for misrepresentation,
which one of the following facts or inferences, if it were the only one
true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the reporter?

(A) At the time the plaintiff purchased the company's stock, the

company's financial condition was a matter of public record.

(B) The reporter's statement “I think the company is a good investment”

was an expression of opinion.

(C) The plaintiff did not purchase the edition of the newspaper that

contained the reporter's statement, but read it after finding it on a
bus.

(D) The reporter did not know that any person would rely on her

statement.

104. Upon borrowing money from her accountant, the landowner executed a
note and a mortgage on her realty in favor of her accountant. The
accountant immediately and properly recorded the mortgage. One
month later, the landowner borrowed money from her brother,
executing a note and a mortgage on the realty in her brother's favor.
The landowner's brother immediately and properly recorded the
mortgage. The landowner died soon afterwards, leaving a will that
devised the realty to her nephew for life, remainder to her niece. Her
nephew subsequently moved onto the realty. Neither the accountant nor
the landowner's brother received payment as required by the notes
executed by the landowner.

Without notifying or serving process on the landowner's nephew and
niece, the accountant asks a court to order a foreclosure sale of the
realty. The court should

(A) order the sale of a life estate only.

(B) order the sale of a remainder only.

(C) order the sale of a fee interest.

(D) deny the accountant's request.

105. The defendant and the victim, who resided in the city, purchased rifles.

Because neither of them had ever fired a rifle before, they decided to

1145

take them to the municipal dump to try them out. Although both
believed that the dump was outside city limits, it was actually within
city limits. At the dump, the defendant shot his rifle in the victim's
direction, aiming slightly to the right to miss the victim. The bullet
struck a rock and ricocheted, hitting the victim in the back and causing
his death.

A city ordinance provides that “Any person who shall discharge a
firearm knowing that he or she is within the municipal limits shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $100.”
Which of the following is the most serious crime of which the
defendant may properly be convicted?

(A) Murder.

(B) Voluntary manslaughter.

(C) Attempted murder.

(D) Discharging a firearm within the municipal limits.

106. The plaintiff asserted a personal injury claim against the defendant for
injuries that she sustained when their cars collided at an intersection.
At the trial, the witness, an eyewitness to the accident, testified that
when it occurred, the traffic light at the intersection was red against the
plaintiff. In a prior deposition given under oath, the witness had stated
that, at the time of the accident, the light was green in the plaintiff's
favor.

The witness was called by the defendant and her testimony was given
on direct examination by the defendant's attorney. On cross-
examination, the witness authenticated the deposition described above,
and the plaintiff's attorney offered it in evidence. Over the defendant's
objection, the deposition should be

(A) admitted for impeachment only.

(B) admitted as substantive evidence only.

(C) admitted for impeachment and as substantive evidence.

(D) excluded.

107. A waiter worked for a catering service owned by a chef. One night

while the waiter was working a dinner party in State A, he dumped hot
soup on a professor. The professor was a citizen of State B and the

1146

chef was a citizen of State A. The professor sued the chef in federal
district court in State A based on diversity jurisdiction. The professor
claimed $100,000 in damages. The professor had the summons served
on the chef personally at her kitchen in State A. The chef wanted to
implead the waiter as a third-party defendant. The waiter lived in State
C, 60 miles away from the district court in State A. The chef had the
summons served on the waiter personally at her home. Under State A's
long-arm statute, state courts did not have personal jurisdiction over
defendants who could not be personally served within the state itself.

Would the federal district court in State A have personal jurisdiction
over the chef's third-party claim?

(A) No, because the district court must follow the long-arm statute of

State A.

(B) No, because there is no indication the waiter would be liable for at

least $75,000 in damages.

(C) Yes, because the waiter lived 60 miles away.

(D) Yes, the chef is diverse from the waiter.

108. Which of the following constitutional provisions is most likely to give
Congress the power to pass a law making it a federal crime for
persons or corporations in the construction industry to practice racial
discrimination in their hiring practices?

(A) The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

(B) The Involuntary Servitude Clause of the Thirteenth Amendment.

(C) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(D) The Previous Condition of Servitude Clause of the Fifteenth

Amendment.

109. On March 1, the seller entered into a written agreement with a licensed
real estate broker. By its terms, the seller agreed to pay the broker a
commission equal to 6 percent of the price if, prior to April 15, the
broker procured a buyer ready, willing, and able to pay $50,000 for
the seller's realty. In return, the broker agreed to make reasonable
efforts to sell it.

After the agreement was executed, the broker advertised the seller's
property and showed it to several prospective buyers. On April 10,

1147

the buyer signed a document agreeing to purchase the seller's realty for
$50,000 but stating that her agreement was contingent upon her success
in obtaining the necessary financing. The same day, the broker
presented to the seller the document that the buyer had signed. The
seller read it, thought for a moment, and handed it back to the broker,
saying, “I won't even consider a deal built around a contingency.”
Although the broker protested that the agreement between him and the
seller did not specify a sale without contingencies, the seller refused
to discuss the matter any further.

On April 11, the broker informed the buyer of the seller's response.
The buyer then obtained a cashier's check for $50,000 payable to the
seller. She delivered the check to the broker, together with a signed
document in which she agreed to purchase the seller's realty for that
sum. On April 14, the broker presented the second document to the
seller with the cashier's check. The seller said, “I've changed my
mind. I'm not interested in selling.”

If the broker asserts a claim against the seller for a commission, the
court should find for

(A) the seller, because he did not agree to sell the realty to the buyer.

(B) the seller, because his rejection of the buyer's offer on April 10

terminated his agreement with the broker.

(C) the broker, because the seller's oral rejection of the buyer's written

offer of April 10 was invalid under the Statute of Frauds.

(D) the broker, because on April 14 the buyer was ready, willing, and

able to purchase the seller's realty for $50,000.

110. The defendant was speeding in her car 15 miles per hour above the
speed limit when the car's steering mechanism failed, causing her to
lose control of the vehicle. The vehicle spun approximately 250
degrees before skidding across the plaintiff's lawn and colliding with
the side of the plaintiff's house, causing serious structural damage to
the building.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damage to his
realty, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant entered his realty without his

permission.

1148

(B) the plaintiff, because the defendant negligently operated her car by

speeding.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant had the last clear chance to

avoid damaging his realty.

(D) the defendant, because she was privileged by necessity to enter the

plaintiff's realty.

111. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the plaintiff claimed

that the defendant breached a contract to market the plaintiff's products.
At trial, the plaintiff testified that she and the defendant had reached an
agreement at a conference held in the office of the plaintiff's attorney
on October 15. She stated that she and the defendant discussed five
separate products on that occasion. On direct examination of the
plaintiff, the attorney asked her to name the products that had been
discussed. The plaintiff named four of them, but said she could not
remember the fifth. After having them properly marked for
identification, the attorney offered to show the plaintiff notes that the
attorney had made during the conference, asking whether looking at
them would refresh the plaintiff's recollection. The defendant's
attorney objected to the plaintiff's looking at the notes. The objection
should be

(A) sustained, because the notes had not been made by the plaintiff.

(B) sustained, because the notes were not in evidence.

(C) sustained, because the attorney's question was leading.

(D) overruled.

112. A state law empowers any municipality within the state to collect a

property tax from its landowners if a plan to do so is proposed by its
governing body and approved by a majority of its eligible voters. The
township is a municipality governed by a Township Council. Pursuant
to the above law, the Township Council proposed a property tax plan
and scheduled a special election for August 15 to submit the plan for
voter approval. The Township Council declared that only persons
owning land within the township were eligible to vote in the special
election and that eligible voters were required to register for that
purpose at the Township Hall between the hours of 1 P.M. and 3 P.M. on
Tuesday, July 15. The constitutionality of the special election was
challenged in an appropriate proceeding by a petitioner with standing.

1149

If the special election is found to be unconstitutional, it will probably
be because

(A) the eligibility requirements violated the Fifteenth Amendment by

excluding a discrete class of persons.

(B) the registration requirement had the effect of imposing a residence

qualification for voter eligibility.

(C) all persons who did not own land were excluded from the voting

process.

(D) conducting the special election on an at-large basis could have the
effect of diluting the political power of a particular interest group.

113. The plaintiff was the manufacturer of a chair that she usually sold only
to furniture dealers. When the plaintiff recently stopped making the
product, she found that she had only 75 of the chairs left. As a result,
the plaintiff published the following advertisement in a popular
magazine:

For  Sale  to  the  Public.  Chairs  at  $100  each  (or  $80  each  in  orders  of
10 or more). Act fast. There are only 75 left. When they're gone, don't
ask for any more.

On February 12, the defendant, a furniture dealer, saw the
advertisement and wrote to the plaintiff, “We will purchase all 75
Chairs at the wholesale price.”

On February 15, the plaintiff received the defendant's letter and wrote
to the defendant, saying, “This will confirm our agreement to the sale
of 75 Chairs at $80 each. Shipment to follow immediately.”

On February 20, the defendant telephoned the plaintiff to say that he
had changed his mind and did not want the chairs after all. Within the
next two weeks, the plaintiff sold all the chairs for $80 each to
individuals who purchased one chair each.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from breach of contract, the court should award the plaintiff

(A) a sum equivalent to the profit that the plaintiff would have made by

selling all the chairs to the defendant.

(B) a sum equivalent to the total of the difference between $100 per

1150

chair and the price that the plaintiff actually received.

(C) a sum equivalent to the difference between the price that the

defendant had agreed to pay and the actual market value of the
chairs.

(D) nothing, because the plaintiff sustained no loss as a result of the

defendant's failure to purchase the chairs.

114. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for injuries that he
sustained when a gas stove that he purchased from the defendant
exploded while he was attempting to use it. At trial, the plaintiff
produced a snapshot photograph that he said had been taken by him
prior to the accident and which he said was an accurate representation
of the stove. On behalf of the defendant, the defendant's employee
testified that he had installed the stove. The employee produced a
photograph from an advertising brochure and stated that it fairly and
accurately represented the stove that the plaintiff had purchased from
the defendant and that the employee had installed. The stove in the
photograph offered by the defendant was clearly different from the
stove in the photograph offered by the plaintiff.

Both photographs were offered into evidence, and each party's
attorney objected to admission of the other party's photograph. In
response to the objections, the court should

(A) admit both photographs and allow the jury to decide whether either

of them accurately represents the stove in question.

(B) admit only the photograph offered by the plaintiff.

(C) admit only the photograph offered by the defendant.

(D) not admit either photograph.

115. The landlord, the owner of a seven-story office building, leased the

entire sixth floor to an attorney for a period of five years by a written
lease that fixed the rent at $2,000 per month. There were only two
offices on the sixth floor, identified as Office 6A and Office 6B. A
clause in the lease provided that in the event it ever became necessary
to determine how the rent payments were apportioned, it was
understood that $900 of each month's rent was to be applied to Office
6A, $900 was to be applied to Office 6B, and $200 was to be applied
to the hallways and other common areas. The lease prohibited
assignment by the attorney without the landlord's written permission

1151

and provided that such permission would not be unreasonably
withheld.

One year after executing the lease, the attorney entered into a written
agreement with a second attorney. Under its terms, the second attorney
was to occupy Office 6A for the balance of the attorney's term at a
monthly rental of $1,500 payable to the attorney. The second attorney
was an attorney with a better reputation and a more lucrative practice
than the first attorney's.

The landlord refused to consent to the attorney's arrangement with the
second attorney. The landlord subsequently asserted a claim against
the attorney for breaching the lease provision prohibiting assignment.
Which of the following would be the attorney's most effective
argument in response to that claim?

(A) The attorney's agreement with the second attorney was not an

assignment because the rent paid by the second attorney was not in
the same sum as the rent paid by the first attorney.

(B) The attorney's agreement with the second attorney was not an

assignment because it only gave the second attorney the right to
occupy part of the sixth floor.

(C) The clause prohibiting assignment was an invalid restraint on

alienation.

(D) The landlord's refusal to consent was not reasonable because the
second attorney's credit was as good as the first attorney's.

116. The defendant wrote a column about life in suburbia that appeared

regularly in a newspaper of general circulation. In one of his columns,
the defendant mentioned his neighbor, the plaintiff, by name, and
referred to him as “a silly pig.” If the plaintiff asserts a defamation
claim against the defendant as a result of this reference, which of the
following would be the defendant's most effective argument in
defense?

(A) The defendant did not have actual malice when he made the

statement.

(B) Reasonable persons would not believe that the statement asserted a

fact about the plaintiff.

(C) Reasonable persons would not believe the statement to be true.

1152

(D) At the time the defendant made the statement, he was of the opinion

that it was an accurate assertion of fact.

117. A brick supplier wrote to a builder, stating “We will sell you bricks at

$1 per brick for as many bricks as you would like to purchase, up to
100,000 per quarter.” The brick supplier signed the letter. The builder
did not refrain from entering any other deals or otherwise rely on the
letter, but he did write back, “I accept your offer to sell any bricks I
need to me for $1. We will likely order some bricks this summer.” The
builder signed the letter. Six months later, the builder placed an order
for 50,000 bricks at a $1 per brick. The brick supplier responded that
due to transportation costs outside of its control, the price of bricks
was now $1.50.

The builder sued the supplier for breach of contract. May the builder
recover?

(A) Yes, because the offer was in writing and signed by the supplier.

(B) Yes, because the acceptance was in writing and signed by the

builder.

(C) No, because the revocation was based on increased transportation

costs.

(D) No, because the builder did not provide sufficient consideration.

118. After inheriting a large tract of land, the landowner subdivided it into

60 numbered lots pursuant to state law, filing a plat map and
development scheme that indicated that all lots in the subdivision
would be restricted to residential use. The landowner thereafter
conveyed Lot 1 to his brother and Lot 2 to his sister by deeds
containing a condition restricting the lots to residential use.

The landowner's sister announced her intention to erect a motorcycle
repair shop on Lot 2, and her brother instituted a proceeding seeking to
prevent his sister from doing so. Which of the following additional
facts or inferences, if it was the only one true, would be most likely to
result in a decision in the brother's favor?

(A) The brother's deed to Lot 1 was recorded prior to his sister's

purchase of Lot 2.

(B) The brother purchased Lot 1 before his sister purchased Lot 2.

1153

(C) The brother was aware of the landowner's development scheme

when he purchased Lot 1 from the landowner.

(D) The sister was aware of the landowner's development scheme

when she purchased Lot 2 from the landowner.

119. The plaintiff was hired as a probationary employee by an agency of the
state pursuant to a written contract. The contract provided that at the
end of one year, the parties could agree to renew the contract for an
additional one-year period, but that either party could, without cause,
elect not to renew.

Eleven months after hiring him, the agency informed the plaintiff in
writing that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the year.
The plaintiff asked the agency for a hearing on his fitness to be
rehired, but his request was denied. The plaintiff subsequently
instituted a proceeding to challenge the decision of the agency on the
ground that its failure to hold a hearing before deciding not to rehire
him violated his right to due process.

Which of the following would be the agency's most effective argument
in response to the plaintiff's challenge?

(A) Due process was not required, since the decision not to rehire the

plaintiff did not deprive him of life, liberty, or property.

(B) State employment is a privilege rather than a right, since no person

is guaranteed employment by the state.

(C) There would be no point in holding a hearing in the plaintiff's case,

since the hearing officer would be an employee of the agency and
the findings would necessarily support the decision already made
by the agency.

(D) The plaintiff's constitutional rights could not have been violated by
the decision not to renew his contract, since the contract provided
that the decision could be made without cause.

120. The plaintiff purchased realty in the county in 2000 and has lived on it
since then. The realty is located approximately one mile from a private
airport owned and operated by the defendant. At the time of the
plaintiff's purchase, county ordinances restricted the use of the
defendant's airport to aircraft of a particular type. Noise from the
airport was not disturbing to the plaintiff. Recently, however, the

1154

county adopted an ordinance allowing other kinds of aircraft to use the
airport. Since then, noise levels from the airport have increased,
disturbing the quiet atmosphere of the plaintiff's home.

If the plaintiff desires to assert a claim against the defendant on
account of noise from the airport, which of the following would be his
most effective theory of recovery?

(A) Private nuisance.

(B) Prescriptive aeronautical easement.

(C) Inverse condemnation.

(D) Continuing trespass.

121. While the defendant and his wife were standing in line outside a movie
theater, the defendant whispered to his wife that he had committed a
series of robberies the previous week. The defendant was
subsequently arrested and charged with the robberies in a jurisdiction
that holds that confidential marital communications are privileged.

A prosecution witness attempted to testify that he overheard the
defendant's whispered statement to his wife while standing behind
them in the movie line. If the defendant objects to this testimony, his
objection should be

(A) sustained, because communications made within a marriage are

presumed to be confidential.

(B) sustained, because the statement is inadmissible hearsay.

(C) overruled, because the statement is admissible as an admission.

(D) overruled, because a communication concerning a crime is not

subject to the marital privilege.

122. After he was fired, a man filed suit in state court in State A against a

company. The man's complaint alleged a single federal discrimination
claim and a number of state law claims. The company removed the
case to federal district court. The man then amended his complaint to
remove the discrimination claim because he believed it was untenable
and moved to have the case remanded to state court.

May the federal district court remand the case to state court?

(A) No, because the case must be dismissed.

1155

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

(B) No, because the state claims were in federal court based on

pendent jurisdiction.

(C) Yes, because the claim was originally brought in state court.

(D) Yes, because of judicial economy.

123. The defendant was charged with assaulting the victim. At the trial, the

victim testified that he accidentally bumped into the defendant while
walking on a crowded street, and that the defendant responded by
repeatedly hitting and punching him. As part of his defense, the
defendant denied that he had ever struck any person intentionally and
testified that any contact between the victim and him had been
accidental.

The prosecutor subsequently called a witness. The witness testified
that she and the defendant were divorced, but that she had been
married to him for 10 years. She stated that during the period of their
marriage, the defendant had frequently struck her with his fists in
public places. The jurisdiction recognized a privilege for marital
communications. If the defendant's attorney objects and asks the court
to exclude the witness's testimony, the testimony should be

(A) excluded, because the jurisdiction recognizes a privilege for

marital communications.

(B) excluded, because it is not relevant to a material issue.

(C) admitted, because it bears on the defendant's reputation for truth

and veracity.

(D) admitted, because the defendant testified in his own defense.

124. The plaintiff showed his silver coins to the defendant and asked

whether the defendant would be interested in trading them for
chickens. After inspecting the coins, the defendant and the plaintiff
placed them in a bag that they sealed together and left with a banker
whom they both knew. Then, in a writing signed by both of them, they
agreed to the trade.

Pursuant to the terms of their agreement, the defendant was to deliver
6,000 fryer chickens to the plaintiff on July 1, at which time the bag of
coins would be turned over to the defendant as payment in full. In May,
weather conditions were such that the price of fryer chickens
increased to three times what it had been when the agreement was

1156

signed. Although it was foreseeable that the market price for fryer
chickens would change dramatically, neither party knew that the
marker price of fryer chickens would change,

On July 1, the defendant refused to deliver 6,000 fryer chickens to the
plaintiff. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for breach
of contract, the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because neither party knew that the market price of

fryer chickens would change.

(B) the defendant, because the likelihood of fluctuation in the value of

money makes this contract aleatory.

(C) the plaintiff, because it was foreseeable that the market price of

fryer chickens would change dramatically.

(D) the plaintiff, because the transaction was not a sale as defined by

the UCC.

125. The defendant, a water supply company, owned a well adjacent to the
plaintiff's land. By a conveyance that properly described the size and
location of the easement, the plaintiff granted the defendant an
easement across his realty “for the installation of underground pipe or
pipes for the transport of water to customers of the defendant.”
Pursuant to the easement, the defendant subsequently installed a single
underground pipe across the plaintiff's land. After the installation, the
defendant regularly entered the plaintiff's land to service its
underground pipe, occasionally excavating for that purpose. Twenty
years after the easement had been granted, construction of a nearby
housing development caused the number of the defendant's customers
to double, making it necessary for the defendant to transport more
water than the single pipe could carry. The defendant notified the
plaintiff that it planned to install a second underground pipe alongside
the first within the area over which the defendant had an easement. The
plaintiff objected and instituted an appropriate proceeding to stop the
defendant from installing a second underground pipe.

Which of the following arguments would be most likely to result in a
judgment for the plaintiff?

(A) Twenty years of continuous use by the defendant established the

scope of the easement.

1157

(B) The initial installation of a single pipe by the defendant established

the scope of the easement.

(C) When the easement was granted, neither party could have

anticipated that the number of the defendant's customers would
double.

(D) The plaintiff's grant to the defendant did not specify the number of

pipes that could be installed.

126. By a contract calling for the delivery of marketable title, the seller

agreed to sell the buyer a parcel of realty consisting of four adjacent
lots. On the date set for closing, the seller informed the buyer that one
of the four lots was encumbered by a utility company easement. The
seller said that it was unlikely that the utility company would ever
attempt to exercise its easement and offered to either execute a general
warranty deed to the entire parcel, including a covenant against
encumbrances, or to convey the remaining three lots to the buyer,
deducting from the purchase price the reasonable value of the
encumbered lot. The buyer refused both offers.

In litigation between the seller and the buyer for breach of contract, a
court should find for

(A) the seller, because a covenant against encumbrances would have

given the buyer sufficient protection.

(B) the seller, because title to the remaining three lots was marketable
and abatement of the purchase price would assure the buyer of
receiving the value for which he had bargained.

(C) the buyer, because the seller knew of the easement at the time the

contract of sale was formed.

(D) the buyer, because the seller failed to deliver marketable title.

127. At the trial of a personal injury action brought by the plaintiff against
the defendant and arising out of an automobile accident, the plaintiff
attempted to testify that immediately following the accident, the
defendant offered to pay $500 to fix the plaintiff's car. Over objection
by the defendant's attorney, the plaintiff's statement should be

(A) excluded, because to admit such evidence would violate public

policy.

(B) admitted, because the court could give the defendant an opportunity

1158

to explain his offer.

(C) admitted, as a declaration against the defendant's pecuniary interest.

(D) admitted, as an implied admission of a party.

128. The defendant was out walking when she saw the plaintiff, a seven-

year-old child, suddenly chase a ball into the street in the path of a car
driven by a driver. Afraid that the plaintiff would be hit by the car, the
defendant ran into the roadway and pushed the plaintiff out of the way.
The driver's car struck the defendant. The plaintiff was not hit by the
driver's car, but he hurt his knees when he fell to the ground as a result
of being pushed by the defendant. The jurisdiction applies the all-or-
nothing rule of contributory negligence.

If the plaintiff asserts a negligence claim against the defendant for the
injuries to his knees, which one of the following additional facts or
inferences, if it was the only one true, would be most likely to result in
a judgment for the defendant?

(A) The plaintiff's injury was proximately caused by the negligence of

the driver.

(B) If the defendant had not pushed him out of the way, the plaintiff

would have been struck by the driver's car and killed.

(C) The defendant was severely injured as a result of being struck by

the driver's car.

(D) The situation confronted the defendant with an emergency.

129. At a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of aggravated assault. On
appeal, the defendant's conviction was reversed on the ground that, as
a matter of law, the evidence against her was insufficient to establish
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Subsequently, the prosecutor
attempted to try the defendant again on the same charge. If the
defendant asserts that the subsequent prosecution violates the
constitutional protection against double jeopardy and moves to dismiss
it, her motion should be

(A) denied, because the reversal of her conviction ended any jeopardy

that attached as a result of the initial prosecution.

(B) denied, because the reversal amounted to a declaration that the trial
was a nullity and that she had, therefore, never been in jeopardy as
a result of the initial prosecution.

1159

(C) denied, because the defendant waived the constitutional protection

against double jeopardy by appealing her conviction.

(D) granted.

130. After he was injured during surgery, a man sued a doctor in federal
district court. The doctor's lawyer hired a private investigator, who
interviewed several witnesses to the surgery, including the head nurse.
The investigator filmed all of the interviews with his phone and made
transcripts of them. During the head nurse's interview, she stated
certain facts regarding what happened during the surgery that were
only known to the head nurse. Shortly after the interview, the head
nurse died. Is the man entitled to a copy or transcript of the interview?

(A) Yes, because the head nurse is dead.

(B) Yes, because the investigator was the one who filmed and

transcribed the interviews.

(C) No, because the interview was prepared in anticipation of

litigation.

(D) No, because the interview was prepared by another on the

attorney's behalf.

131. The state published an advertisement calling for bids “for a contract to
be the exclusive supplier of fuel for state vehicles.” The plaintiff
submitted a bid and, after negotiation, entered into a written contract to
supply at a specified price per gallon for a period of one year “all fuel
ordered by the state.” Several months after executing the contract, the
plaintiff learned that the state was purchasing substantial amounts of
fuel from other suppliers.

The plaintiff asserted a claim against the state for breach of contract.
At the trial, state attorneys offered the written contract into evidence
and pointed out that its language did not specifically state that the
plaintiff was to be the exclusive supplier. When the plaintiff attempted
to offer a copy of the advertisement calling for bids into evidence,
state attorneys objected on the ground that the advertisement was
inadmissible under the parol evidence rule. The plaintiff's most
effective argument in response to the state's objections would be that
the advertisement

(A) tends to show that the written contract was ambiguous.

1160

(B) was in writing.

(C) was a communication that led to a written contract.

(D) was an invitation to negotiate.

132. In 2008, the landowner conveyed a parcel of realty to her oldest son in
fee simple absolute as a gift. At the landowner's request, the oldest son
did not record the conveyance. In 2010, the landowner borrowed
$10,000 from a neighbor, executing a note purporting to be secured by
a mortgage on the land. The neighbor did not record the mortgage. In
2012, the landowner purported to convey the land in fee simple to her
youngest son as a gift. The youngest son immediately recorded the
deed. On default by the landowner, the neighbor now seeks to
foreclose on the land.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “No transfer of an interest in
real property shall be good and effectual in law or equity against
creditors or subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless
it shall be recorded.”

Is the neighbor entitled to foreclose on the land?

(A) No, because his mortgage was not recorded.

(B) No, because the youngest son recorded his deed in 2012.

(C) Yes.

(D) No, because the oldest son owns the land in fee simple absolute.

133. The plaintiff bought from the defendant, a car dealer, a new car

manufactured by the manufacturer. The vehicle was equipped with a
seat belt warning indicator, although the law did not require such a
device. The indicator was designed to cause a bright red light on the
dashboard to begin glowing when the engine was started and to remain
lit until the driver's seat belt was fastened. When the car was delivered
to the plaintiff, an employee of the defendant explained to the plaintiff
that the seat belt warning indicator was not working, but that the
defendant would repair it without charge as soon as the necessary
parts were received.

The following day, the plaintiff was involved in an accident while
driving the new car. As a result of the impact, she was thrown from the
vehicle and sustained an injury when her head struck the pavement. If

1161

she had been wearing a seat belt at the time, she would not have been
injured.

The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim against the defendant for
her injuries on the ground that the failure of the seat belt warning
indicator made the vehicle defective. Which of the following would be
the defendant's most effective argument in response to that allegation?

(A) When the plaintiff drove the vehicle, she was aware that the seat

belt warning indicator was not working.

(B) The law did not require the vehicle to be equipped with a seat belt

warning indicator.

(C) It is impossible to prove with certainty that the plaintiff would have

worn a seat belt if the seat belt warning indicator had been
working.

(D) The failure of the seat belt warning indicator was the result of the

negligence of the manufacturer.

134. A man owned a home worth $200,000. He had three mortgages on the
property. The first mortgage was for $150,000 and was owed to first
bank. The second mortgage was for $30,000 and was owed to second
bank. The third mortgage was for $10,000 and was owed to third bank.
The first mortgage was foreclosed, and the bid at the foreclosure sale
was $200,000. The attorney's fees and foreclosure expenses were
$15,000, and the accrued interest on the first mortgage was $5,000.

How will the funds from the foreclosure sale be distributed?

(A) $5,000 to the accrued interest, $15,000 to attorneys and foreclosure
expenses, $150,000 to the first mortgage, $30,000 to the second
mortgage, and nothing to the third mortgage.

(B) $5,000 to the accrued interest, $15,000 to attorneys and foreclosure
expenses, $150,000 to the first mortgage, $20,000 to the second
mortgage, and $10,000 to the third.

(C) $5,000 to the accrued interest, $15,000 to attorneys and foreclosure
expenses, $140,000 to the first mortgage, $30,000 to the second
mortgage, and $10,000 to the third mortgage

(D) $15,000 to attorneys and foreclosure expenses, $150,000 to first
mortgage, $30,000 to second mortgage, $5,000 to third mortgage,

1162

nothing to the accrued interest.

135. After the plaintiff instituted litigation against the defendant, the

defendant's attorney demanded that the plaintiff furnish the answers to
a list of interrogatories as provided by the state code of civil
procedure. Interrogatory #4 was “List the plaintiff's gross sales
receipts for each month during the four-year period in controversy.” In
response to this interrogatory, the plaintiff responded, “Gross receipts
for the period in question are contained in an industry publication.”
The court provided judicial notice that the industry publication was a
reputable source that reasonably well informed people regarded as
accurate.

At trial, the defendant's attorney attempted to offer into evidence those
portions of the industry publication listing the plaintiff's gross receipts
for the months in question. Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney,
the court should rule those portions of the industry publication

(A) inadmissible, because the contents of the industry publication have

not been shown to be accurate.

(B) inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.

(C) admissible as an admission of a party.

(D) admissible, because the industry publication was shown to be a
reputable source that reasonably well informed people regard as
accurate.

136. After the victim lost all his money to the defendant in a dice game, the
two men began to argue. During the course of the argument, the
defendant stabbed the victim in the leg with a knife. The victim
staggered home and pounded on the door, begging his wife to let him
in. The wife realized that the victim needed medical attention because
he was bleeding badly, but she was so angry at him for gambling that
she refused to open the door or call a doctor. The victim collapsed on
the doorstep and died an hour later from loss of blood. The wife could
have secured immediate medical attention for the victim, and if she had
done so, the victim would not have died.

If the defendant is prosecuted for the murder of the victim, which of
the following would be his most effective argument in defense?

(A) The defendant did not cause the victim's death because the victim

1163

would not have died if the wife had secured prompt medical
attention.

(B) Leg wounds do not usually result in death.

(C) It was unforeseeable that the wife would refuse to secure medical
attention for the victim when she knew that he needed it so badly.

(D) The wife's omission to secure medical attention was a substantial

factor in producing the victim's death.

137. A state statute grants state employees an annual 5 percent salary

increase. Another statute provides that upon retirement, a state
employee shall receive an annual pension equivalent to 60 percent of
the salary received during the year immediately prior to retirement.
The state also maintains a group health insurance plan for state
employees. After determining that the health insurance plan could be
operated less expensively if it did not include persons over the age of
65, the state legislature passed a compulsory retirement law requiring
state employees to retire at the age of 65.

The plaintiff, who was employed by the state as a station engineer,
reached the age of 65 several years after the compulsory retirement
law was passed. His job did not require any skills or abilities related
to age. When he was informed that he was required to retire, the
plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory retirement
law. In support of his challenge, the plaintiff proved that a federal law
permits station engineers employed by the federal government to
continue working until they are 70.

In deciding the plaintiff's claim, the court should hold that the state's
mandatory retirement law is

(A) invalid under the Supremacy Clause.

(B) invalid, because the plaintiff's job did not require skills or abilities

that were related to age.

(C) valid, because the state could operate its employee health insurance

plan on a more economically efficient basis by mandating
retirement at 65.

(D) valid, because the federal government may not impose economic

burdens on the state.

1164

138. A banker, a citizen of State A, was injured in a car accident with a
doctor, a citizen of State A, and a lawyer, a citizen of State B. The
banker sued both the doctor and the lawyer in state court for $100,000.
The banker then voluntarily dismissed the doctor. Twenty-five days
later, the lawyer sought removal to the federal district court.

May the lawsuit be removed to federal court?

(A) Yes, because there is now complete diversity of citizenship.

(B) Yes, because the lawyer sought removal within 30 days of the

doctor's dismissal.

(C) No, because the lawyer did not seek removal within 14 days of the

doctor's dismissal.

(D) No, because the banker voluntarily dismissed the doctor.

139. The Department of Highway Transportation is the agency of state

government responsible for maintaining state highways. While driving
on a state highway, the defendant attempted to pass the plaintiff's
vehicle on the right. As she did so, one of the defendant's wheels
struck a pothole, causing her car to go out of control and strike the
plaintiff's car. The pothole existed because the Department of Highway
Transportation was negligent in maintaining the road surface, and there
were many potholes in the area. The defendant would not have lost
control of her car if she had not hit the pothole while driving at an
unreasonably fast rate of speed. A statute in the jurisdiction prohibits
passing on the right. The jurisdiction has also abolished the concept of
governmental immunity.

The plaintiff subsequently asserted a negligence claim against the
defendant for injuries sustained in the accident. If the defendant's only
argument in defense is that the pothole was a superseding cause of
harm, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant's attempt to pass the plaintiff on

the right was a violation of an automobile safety statute.

(B) the plaintiff, because potholes are often found on the road surfaces

where the accident occurred.

(C) the plaintiff, because the concept of governmental immunity has

been abolished in the jurisdiction.

1165

(D) the defendant, because the accident would not have happened but

for the existence of the pothole.

140. The plaintiff had an exclusive five-year contract to sell products
manufactured by the defendant. When the defendant canceled the
contract in its third year, the plaintiff entered into a similar contract
with another manufacturer. The plaintiff then asked an attorney to sue
the defendant for breach of contract. Because the compensation plans
in the plaintiff's contracts with the defendant and the other company
were extremely complex, the attorney was unable to determine whether
the defendant's breach had damaged the plaintiff. Before agreeing to
represent the plaintiff, the attorney therefore arranged for the plaintiff
to meet with the witness, an accountant. At the attorney's request, the
witness interviewed the plaintiff, obtained certain facts from her, and
made mathematical calculations that she submitted to the attorney.

The attorney subsequently commenced a lawsuit against the defendant
on the plaintiff's behalf. At the trial, the defendant's attorney called the
accountant as a witness and attempted to question her about her
interview with the plaintiff. If the attorney objects to the examination
of the witness, the most effective argument in support of her objection
would be that statements made by the plaintiff to the witness are

(A) privileged as part of an attorney's work product.

(B) records kept in the course of business.

(C) inadmissible hearsay.

(D) confidential communications between client and attorney.

141. A man and a woman were residents of a local housing project in the

center of the city. Because the housing project was thought of as a
hotbed of crime and gang activity, the city wanted to tear down the
project and relocate the project's 800 residents to several smaller
apartment buildings spread out among the far suburbs. The man and the
woman filed suit against the city housing authority in federal district
court, claiming that the city's plan violated their federal due process
rights. The man and the woman wanted to certify a class made up of
the current project residents. The best law firm in the city agreed to
take the case, and the man and the woman were longtime residents of
the project who each owned small successful businesses. Their action
sought an injunction to stop the planned demolition and relocation from
going forward.

1166

Can the action go forward as a class action?

(A) Yes, because the injunction would likely be worth more than

$75,000.

(B) Yes, because the requested injunction is appropriate to the class as

a whole.

(C) No, because a class action cannot be based on a request for an

injunction.

(D) No, because joinder of the project residents would be more

appropriate.

142. A man was negligently flying his new drone when it hit a woman
walking on the sidewalk nearby. According to Federal Aviation
Authority law, drones were aircraft that needed to be registered. The
man's drone was not. The drone did not hit the woman very hard, but it
did cause her to fall on the ground. Although an ordinary person would
have suffered at most slight scrapes or bruises, the woman had a rare
brain condition that made any fall extremely dangerous to her optic
nerves. Because of the fall, the woman's optic nerves disconnected and
she became blind. The woman sued the man for damages related to
loss of her sight.

May the woman recover?

(A) Yes, because the man failed to register his drone.

(B) Yes, because the man negligently hit her with the drone.

(C) No, because the blindness was caused by the woman's rare medical

condition.

(D) No, because an ordinary person would only have suffered slight

scrapes or bruises.

143. At the jury trial of an action by a bank against the defendant on a

promissory note, the defendant testified that the signature on the note
was not his. An employee of the bank testified that she recognized the
signature as the defendant's. The judge believed the signature on the
promissory note was the defendant's. Accordingly, the judge decided
that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the signature
on the note was the defendant's. The jury was also given an
authenticated sample of the defendant's signature so that they could

1167

decide whether the signature on the promissory note was the
defendant's.

If the bank's attorney offers the promissory note into evidence, it
should be

(A) admitted, because any dispute regarding the genuineness of a

signature should be decided by the jury.

(B) admitted, because the judge decided that the evidence was

sufficient to support a finding that the signature on the note was the
defendant's.

(C) admitted, because the jury was given an authenticated sample of the

defendant's signature so that they could decide whether the
signature on the promissory note was the defendant's.

(D) admitted, because the judge believed that the signature on the

promissory note was the defendant's.

144. A plaintiff belongs to an ethnic minority that constitutes 10 percent of
the general population of the city. Approximately 10 percent of the
motorists driving on a particular road are members of the plaintiff's
ethnic minority. One day, while the plaintiff was driving her
automobile on the road, a police officer stopped her and issued a
traffic summons charging her with driving in excess of the statutory
speed limit. In her defense, the plaintiff asserted that the traffic statute
was unconstitutional as applied.

Which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were
the only one true, would best support the plaintiff's assertion?

(A) In the past two years, the plaintiff has received three such

summonses from the officer, but she has never received one from
another officer.

(B) In the past two years, the officer has issued a total of 300

summonses for driving in excess of the statutory speed limit on the
road, all of which were issued to members of the plaintiff's ethnic
group.

(C) Properly compiled statistics indicate that members of the plaintiff's
ethnic group do not customarily drive faster than members of any
other ethnic group.

1168

(D) At the time the officer issued the summons to the plaintiff, many

people who did not belong to the plaintiff's ethnic group were
driving on the road at speeds in excess of the plaintiff's speed, and
the officer did not issue summonses to any of them.

145. A defendant knew that he often became intoxicated upon drinking small

quantities of alcoholic beverages. He frequently visited the
neighborhood tavern because he liked the atmosphere, but he usually
ordered orange juice or some other non-alcoholic beverage. While at
the tavern one night, the defendant drank half of a friend's glass of beer.
Soon afterwards, he began shouting and throwing objects about the
tavern. A chair that he hurled across the room struck the bartender,
injuring her severely. As a result, the defendant was subsequently
arrested and prosecuted. At the defendant's trial, the defense attorney
called a psychiatrist to the witness stand to testify that the defendant
suffered from a mental illness that made him extremely susceptible to
the effects of alcohol. The psychiatrist offered to testify further that
even a small quantity of beer was likely to make the defendant become
physically violent, and that when this happened to him, he was not
aware that his conduct would result in injury to others.

The defendant's prosecution was for criminal battery. If the prosecutor
moves to exclude the psychiatrist's testimony, the motion should be

(A) granted, because the defendant knew that he often became

intoxicated upon drinking small quantities of alcoholic beverages.

(B) granted, because the sanity of a defendant is a question of fact to be

determined by a jury.

(C) denied, because a jury might find that the defendant's intoxication
prevented him from forming the intent to injure the bartender.

(D) denied, because that testimony could establish that the defendant's

intoxication was involuntary.

146. The buyer and the seller signed a written document agreeing to the sale

of the seller's realty to the buyer. The document adequately described
the realty, required the seller to deliver marketable title by a general
warranty deed, and set the date for closing. It also stated that the price
would be determined by agreement of the parties prior to the date of
closing. The value of real estate in the area could be objectively
determined rather easily. Three weeks before the date set for closing,
the buyer telephoned the seller to discuss the price of the realty. At that

1169

time, the seller told the buyer that she had changed her mind and would
not sell the realty to the buyer at any price. If the buyer asserts a claim
against the seller for breach of contract, the court should find for

(A) the seller, because the Statute of Frauds requires a contract for the

sale of realty to be in writing and to state the price.

(B) the seller, because the parties did not agree on a method for

determining the price.

(C) the buyer, because the value of real estate in the area can be

objectively determined.

(D) the buyer, because where a written contract omits the price term,

the price is to be a reasonable price.

147. The defendant was a college student preparing to take an important

exam. Before the exam, she sneaked into the professor's office, hoping
to steal a copy of the exam answer. The exam answer was locked
securely in the dean's safe, however, and the defendant was therefore
unable to find it. While she was looking, the professor discovered her
in his office, and the defendant told him her reason for being there. A
state statute prohibits the theft of certain specifically defined
“information,” which specifically included “exam answers.” The
defendant did not believe an exam answer was “information” under the
statute. If the defendant is charged with attempting to violate the
statute, she should be found

(A) not guilty, because the exam answers were, in fact, securely locked
in the dean's safe and the defendant could not possibly have stolen
them.

(B) not guilty, because an exam answer is “information” as defined by

the statute, but the defendant believed that it was not.

(C) guilty, because the theft of an exam answer by one preparing to take

the exam is “inherently immoral.”

(D) guilty, because an exam answer is “information” as defined by the

statute, even though the defendant believed that it was not.

148. A group of friends were playing a pickup soccer game. The plaintiff
was dribbling the ball down the field when the defendant kicked the
ball away, tripping the plaintiff and injuring him. If the plaintiff sues
the defendant for battery, the defendant's best defense is

1170

(A) by playing in the game, the plaintiff assumed the risk of the contact.

(B) by playing in the game, the plaintiff consented to the contact.

(C) the defendant did not intend to injure the plaintiff

(D) being tripped in a soccer game is not offensive to a reasonable

sense of dignity.

149. A will devised a parcel of real estate to a brother and his sister as
joint tenants with full right of survivorship. The brother died after
quitclaiming his interest in the realty to his wife. Subsequently, the
sister died, leaving a will that purported to devise her interest in the
realty to her daughter. Which of the following statements most
accurately describes the rights of the wife and the daughter after the
deaths of the brother and the sister?

(A) The wife is the sole owner of the realty.

(B) The daughter is the sole owner of the realty.

(C) The wife and the daughter hold the realty as joint tenants.

(D) The wife and the daughter hold the realty as tenants in common.

150. Congress authorizes a federal agency to lease federally owned land to

livestock ranchers for grazing purposes at specified rental rates. The
plaintiff also owns land in the area that it leases for grazing purposes.
The plaintiff complains that the rates charged by the federal agency are
significantly lower than those charged by the plaintiff and that this has
resulted in unfair competition that will cause the plaintiff an immediate
loss of revenue. In an appropriate proceeding, the plaintiff challenges
the constitutionality of the federal lease.

Which of the following arguments would be most effective IN
OPPOSITION TO the plaintiff's claim?

(A) The Property Clause of Article IV of the Constitution empowers

Congress to dispose of federal land as it sees fit.

(B) The lease of federal land is valid under the Commerce Clause.

(C) The plaintiff lacks standing because the activities of the federal

agency do not affect it directly.

(D) The federal government is immune from claims based on

allegations of unfair competition.

1171

151. A breeder agreed to sell a farmer a cow, which both parties believed
to be barren. The contract price was $200. Prior to delivery of the
cow, the breeder realized the cow was pregnant and refused to deliver
her because her value as a breeding cow was at least $1,000. May the
breeder rescind the contract?

(A) Yes, because the characteristic on which the parties were mistaken

was a basic assumption of the contract.

(B) Yes, because the cow is worth much more as a breeding cow.

(C) No, because the mistake merely went to the adequacy of price.

(D) No, because the farmer merely received an unexpected benefit in

the deal.

152. At the trial of a robbery prosecution, a witness for the prosecution

testified that the robber walked with a limp. While the witness was on
the stand, the prosecutor asked the defendant to walk across the
courtroom. If the defendant objects, asserting his Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination, his objection should be

(A) sustained, because the defendant has not waived the privilege by

testifying in his own behalf.

(B) sustained, because the jury is likely to interpret a refusal by the

defendant to walk across the courtroom as evidence that he is
guilty.

(C) overruled, because the Fifth Amendment privilege applies only to

testimony.

(D) overruled, because the defendant has waived the privilege by

personally appearing in the courtroom.

153. Following her indictment by a grand jury for bank robbery, the
defendant voluntarily surrendered at police headquarters.

The officers went to lunch and returned to headquarters an hour later.
Upon their return, they ordered the defendant to appear in a lineup for
identification purposes in connection with the bank robbery. At first,
the defendant refused. When the officer threatened to use force to
compel her appearance, however, the defendant appeared without
resisting. Witnesses at the lineup identified her as the bank robber.

If the defendant objects to the admission of evidence of the lineup

1172

identification, which of the following would be her most effective
argument in support of her objection?

(A) The defendant was deprived of her right to have an attorney present

during the lineup.

(B) The lineup deprived the defendant of the right to confront her

accusers.

(C) The lineup violated her right against self-incrimination.

(D) Police officers coerced the defendant into appearing in the lineup.

154. A man was snowmobiling with his friend as a passenger. The man
negligently cut across a road and an oncoming car struck the
snowmobile. The friend was severely injured. The driver of the car
called an ambulance, and the ambulance picked up the friend. Because
of the serious nature of the friend's injuries, the ambulance drove in
excess of the speed limit and crashed into a pole. The friend was
killed in the crash. The friend's estate sued the man.

Assuming the estate may recover for the injuries sustained during the
initial car crash, can it recover for the friend's death?

(A) No, because the ambulance broke the chain of liability.

(B) No, because the ambulance was negligent by speeding.

(C) Yes, because the ambulance's rescue attempt was foreseeable.

(D) Yes, because the death was preceded by the friend's serious

injuries.

155. By a properly executed and recorded deed, the landowner conveyed a

parcel of real estate with a building on it as follows:

to the church for as long as the land is used by the church for church
purposes;  and  when  the  land  ceases  to  be  so  used,  to  the  hospital  for
as long as the land shall be used by the hospital for hospital purposes;
and  when  the  land  ceases  to  be  so  used,  to  my  son  if  my  son  is  then
living.

The church moved onto the real estate, using the building as a house of
worship.

If the validity of the interest held by the son is challenged on the sole
ground that it violates the Rule Against Perpetuities, the interest of the

1173

son should be declared

(A) valid, because the church and the hospital are charitable

institutions.

(B) valid.

(C) void, because there is no assurance that the interest of the son will

vest during the period established by the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(D) void, because the interest of the hospital is void.

156. After a nuclear power plant was built in the state, the state passed the
Nuclear Waste Act. The Act regulates the storage of radioactive
wastes and authorizes the construction of radioactive waste storage
facilities at specified locations within the state. Section 40 of the Act
provides that “No radioactive waste storage facility in the state shall
store or accept for storage any radioactive waste resulting from
activities conducted more than five miles from said storage facility.”
All storage facilities within the state that are authorized by the Nuclear
Waste Act are located more than five miles from the state line.

If the constitutionality of Section 40 is challenged in an appropriate
proceeding, it is LEAST likely to be declared unconstitutional under
the

(A) Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

(B) Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(C) Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(D) Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

157. A married couple lived in State A. The wife moved to State B and

filed for divorce in State B state court. The husband was visiting State
B on business and to see his daughters when he was served with the
divorce papers. In a special appearance, the husband moved to quash
service, arguing he had insufficient contacts with State B to confer
personal jurisdiction.

Does the State B court have personal jurisdiction over the husband?

(A) Yes, because the divorce action was filed in state court in State B.

(B) Yes, because the husband was personally served in State B.

(C) No, because the husband was only in State B on business and to see

1174

his daughters.

(D) No, because there is no indication the husband consented to

jurisdiction.

158. The security guard of a warehouse was making his rounds after closing

time one night when he found the defendant walking around inside the
warehouse. When the guard asked him what he was doing there, the
defendant replied that he had been driving past the warehouse when he
noticed that its door was open, and that he had entered to report this to
the guard. The guard called the police, and the defendant was arrested
and charged with violating a statute providing that “any person
entering the building of another for the purpose of committing a crime
therein is guilty of burglary.”

At the defendant's trial, the prosecutor tried to prove that the
defendant's van, parked outside the warehouse at the time of the
defendant's arrest, had license plates on it that had been stolen from an
out-of-state vehicle the day before the defendant's arrest.

Over objection by the defendant's attorney, evidence that the license
plates had been stolen should be

(A) inadmissible, because the defendant was not on trial for stealing

license plates.

(B) inadmissible, because the defendant was not convicted of stealing

license plates.

(C) admissible, because it tends to establish that the defendant was

likely to engage in criminal behavior.

(D) admissible, because it tends to establish that the defendant made

special preparations for the commission of a crime.

159. The farmer was the owner of a peach orchard. On May 15, the seller
contracted in writing to sell the land to the buyer for $200,000 under
terms specified. The agreement called for the delivery of marketable
title and set July 15 as the date for closing. The seller did not own the
land on May 15 but planned to acquire title to it prior to the closing.
On June 1, the buyer assigned his rights under the contract to an
attorney. On June 15, the seller acquired title to the land by purchasing
it from the farmer for $150,000. On July 15, the seller tendered a
general warranty deed, but the buyer and the attorney both refused to

1175

go through with the transaction.

If the seller asserts a breach of contract claim for damages against the
buyer, the court should find for

(A) the seller, because at the time of closing, the seller held marketable

title to the realty.

(B) the seller, under the doctrine of estoppel by deed.

(C) the buyer, because at the time of contracting, the seller did not hold

title to the land.

(D) the buyer, because at the time of closing, the seller's interest was

outside the chain of title.

160. A businessman, a citizen of State A, sued a real estate company in

federal district court in State A for breach of contract. The real estate
company was incorporated in State B and was run by a group of
executives based in State A. However, the majority of its apartments
were located in State C. The businessman claimed that after he was
injured in one of the company's luxury apartments, the company gave
him a free apartment for life in exchange for his promise not to file
suit. However, three years after giving him the free apartment, the
company started charging him rent. The company defended its decision
to start charging the businessman rent by pointing to a new law enacted
by Congress that made gifts of free apartments illegal because of
concerns free apartments were being used to bribe foreign
businessmen and other officials. After a trial, the district court ruled in
favor of the businessman. The company appealed, arguing the case
should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

How should the court rule?

(A) The case should be dismissed, because the company was a citizen

of State A.

(B) The case should be dismissed, because the majority of the

company's apartments were in State C.

(C) The case should not be dismissed, because the company did not

challenge jurisdiction in the initial trial.

(D) The case should not be dismissed, because the company's defense

is based on a law passed by Congress.

1176

161. After police officers arrested the defendant for driving with a

suspended license, the officers handcuffed the defendant and placed
him in their patrol car. The police officers then searched the
defendant's car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the
backseat. At trial, the defendant argued that the search of his car was
unlawful. If the court rules in the defendant's favor, it will be because

(A) searches conducted without prior approval by a judge or magistrate

are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

(B) the defendant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons

or evidence at the time of the search.

(C) the search of the car was not the result of a valid inventory search.

(D) the interior of a car is always within the immediate control of an

arrestee.

162. An insurance salesman sued a company in federal district court after

he was passed over for a promotion. The salesman's claim arose under
federal employment law. In the salesman's complaint, he gave a short
statement claiming he was entitled to relief, but the complaint did not
contain details regarding the alleged employment discrimination and it
set out three different claims that were inconsistent with each other. In
response, the company filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a
claim.

How should the court rule?

(A) Deny the motion, because the complaint contained a short and plain

statement of the claim.

(B) Deny the motion, because the complaint gave the company notice of

the lawsuit.

(C) Grant the motion, because the complaint did not adequately allege a

prima facie case.

(D) Grant the motion, because the complaint contained inconsistent

claims.

163. A man told his friend, a druggist, that he was planning to kill his wife

and asked the druggist to help him by furnishing a poison. Although the
druggist did not actually intend to help the man kill his wife, he said
that he would because he did not want his friend to be angry at him.
The druggist gave the man a commonly used antibiotic, telling him that

1177

it was a deadly and undetectable poison. The druggist knew that the
antibiotic was not supposed to be dispensed without a prescription and
that about 2 percent of the people who received it developed an
allergic reaction to it, but he did not believe that it would hurt the wife.
That night while the wife was asleep, the man injected her with the
antibiotic that the druggist had given him. Because she was allergic to
the drug, the wife became seriously ill and nearly died.

If the druggist is prosecuted for attempted murder, he should be found

(A) guilty, because giving the man the antibiotic without a prescription
with knowledge that the man would give it to his wife shows a
reckless disregard for human life.

(B) guilty, because he did not attempt to stop the man from killing his

wife.

(C) guilty, because he furnished the drug knowing that the man would

use it to attempt to kill his wife.

(D) not guilty, because he did not believe that the wife would die.

164. The defendant was arrested and charged in a state court with the

unlawful possession of a dangerous drug. As his defense, the defendant
asserted that he was an undercover officer in a special division of the
state police department and that he had possessed the drug lawfully as
part of an undercover assignment. During the presentation of its case,
the prosecution called the witness, an official of the state police
department. The witness testified that he was the custodian of a
personnel file that contained the names of all undercover officers
employed by the special division of the state police department and
that he had studied the file before coming to court. He said that all
entries in the file were made by the person who selected its personnel
and issued their assignments when the special division was formed
and as new personnel were added.

The prosecution then offers to have the witness testify that the file
contains no mention of the defendant. The defendant's attorney objects.
Which of the following additional facts and inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most likely to result in the admission of the
witness's testimony?

(A) The file itself is unavailable.

1178

(B) The person who makes the entries in the file is unavailable.

(C) The person who made the entries in the file is dead.

(D) The personnel file is available for inspection by the public.

165. The homeowner, who owned a home in a residential development,

decided to have his driveway paved. He called the plaintiff, a licensed
contractor who specialized in residential driveways, and asked for an
estimate on the job. Although the standard market price to pave a
driveway the size of the homeowner's was $2,750, the plaintiff was
willing to do the job for $2,500 since business was slow. The
homeowner agreed to hire him to do the job at that price and filled out
and signed a detailed work order for the plaintiff's work crew. Since
the 
homeowner was planning to go on vacation for two weeks, he and the
plaintiff agreed that the job would be finished by the time the
homeowner returned.

Three days later, the plaintiff's work crew went out to do the job
described in the homeowner's work order. By mistake, they paved the
neighbor's driveway, which was identical to the homeowner's except
that it was on a different street. The neighbor was out of town at the
time. The job cost the plaintiff $2,600 in labor and materials and
increased the value of the neighbor's realty by $2,100. The homeowner
did not communicate with the plaintiff while away on vacation. When
he returned and discovered that his driveway had not yet been paved,
he demanded that the plaintiff perform as agreed, but the plaintiff
refused.

After the driveway was paved, the neighbor promised to pay the
plaintiff $2,000 for the job. In a jurisdiction that adopts the view of the
Restatement (2d) of Contracts, if the neighbor then refused to pay and
the plaintiff sued him for breaching his promise, which of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one true,
would be most likely to result in a judgment for the plaintiff?

(A) When the neighbor promised to pay, the neighbor knew that the

plaintiff had already paved his driveway.

(B) When the neighbor promised to pay, the neighbor did not know that

the plaintiff had already paved his driveway.

(C) The neighbor decided to have his driveway paved before speaking

1179

with the plaintiff.

(D) The neighbor did not decide to have his driveway paved until

speaking with the plaintiff.

166. The landlord leased an apartment to a new tenant. The lease provided
that the tenant could not assign or sublease without the landlord's
consent. Soon thereafter, the tenant assigned the lease to his friend. The
landlord accepted the friend's first rent payment without any protest.

The landlord then realized he didn't like the idea of having the friend
as a tenant, so he declared the lease terminated. May he do so?

(A) Yes, because assignments were prohibited by the lease.

(B) Yes, because the landlord protested within a reasonable time.

(C) Yes, because the landlord had a superior property interest to the

tenant and the friend.

(D) No, because the landlord waived his right to terminate the lease.

167. The defendant suffered from severe anxiety. One day, he had a job
interview at a new company. Because he was so nervous about the
interview, he took three times the amount of anxiety pills that were
prescribed for him and drank a bottle of beer. The pills and the beer
made him severely intoxicated. On the way to the interview, the
defendant was driving his car when a man in another car ran a red
light. The resulting collision ended up killing the man. A police
investigation showed the defendant was driving at the correct speed
and obeyed all other traffic regulations.

The defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter. How
should the court rule on the involuntary manslaughter charge?

(A) Guilty, because the defendant was grossly negligent in taking three
times the drugs prescribed for him and drinking a beer before
driving.

(B) Guilty, because the defendant was negligent under the totality of the

circumstances.

(C) Guilty, because driving while intoxicated is malum in se.

(D) Not guilty.

168. The defendant's husband owed money to the plaintiff. This was

1180

evidenced by a promissory note. When the note became due, the
defendant signed the back of it and promised to pay the note if her
husband did not. In return, the plaintiff promised he would not put the
note in his bank for immediate collection. Instead, he agreed to “hold it
until the time I want my money.” The plaintiff did not collect on the
note for two years. The plaintiff then sued the defendant based on her
endorsement. If the court does not enforce the agreement, it will be
because

(A) there was no consideration for the promise.

(B) the plaintiff did not detrimentally rely upon the promise.

(C) the defendant's husband was the primary debtor.

(D) the agreement was unconscionable.

169. On March 1, the seller entered into a written agreement with a licensed
real estate broker. By its terms, the seller agreed to pay the broker a
commission equal to 6 percent of the price if, prior to April 15, the
broker procured a buyer ready, willing, and able to pay $50,000 for
the seller's realty. In return, the broker agreed to make reasonable
efforts to sell it.

After the agreement was executed, the broker advertised the seller's
property and showed it to several prospective buyers. On April 10,
the buyer signed a document agreeing to purchase the seller's realty for
$50,000 but stating that her agreement was contingent upon her success
in obtaining the necessary financing. The same day, the broker
presented to the seller the document that the buyer had signed. The
seller read it, thought for a moment, and handed it back to the broker,
saying, “I won't even consider a deal built around a contingency.”
Although the broker protested that the agreement between him and the
seller did not specify a sale without contingencies, the seller refused
to discuss the matter any further.

On April 11, the broker informed the buyer of the seller's response.
The buyer then obtained a cashier's check for $50,000 payable to the
seller. She delivered the check to the broker, together with a signed
document in which she agreed to purchase the seller's realty for that
sum. On April 14, the broker presented the second document to the
seller with the cashier's check. The seller said, “I've changed my
mind. I'm not interested in selling.”

1181

If the buyer institutes a proceeding against the seller for an order
directing the seller to sell her the realty for $50,000, the court should
find for

(A) the seller, because he did not agree to sell the realty to the buyer.

(B) the seller, because his attempt to orally modify his written

agreement with the broker was invalid.

(C) the buyer, because she can show that the realty is unique.

(D) the buyer, because her written agreement to purchase was delivered

with the cashier's check prior to April 15.

170. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the plaintiff claimed

that the defendant breached a contract to market the plaintiff's products.
At trial, the plaintiff testified that she and the defendant had reached an
agreement at a conference held in the office of the plaintiff's attorney
on October 15. She stated that she and the defendant discussed five
separate products on that occasion. On direct examination of the
plaintiff, the attorney asked her to name the products that had been
discussed. The plaintiff named four of them but said she could not
remember the fifth. After having them properly marked for
identification, the plaintiff's attorney offered to show the plaintiff notes
that the attorney had made during the conference, asking whether
looking at them would refresh the plaintiff's recollection.

The defendant's attorney did not object to the plaintiff's looking at the
notes, and the plaintiff stated that looking at the notes refreshed her
recollection. After looking at the notes, the plaintiff named the fifth
product, and the plaintiff's attorney then offered the notes in evidence.
If the defendant's attorney objects to admission of the notes in
evidence, the objection should be

(A) overruled, because the notes constitute a business record.

(B) overruled, because the plaintiff used the notes to refresh her

recollection while testifying.

(C) sustained, because the notes are hearsay not within any exception.

(D) sustained, because the notes constitute an attorney's work product.

171. A state law empowers any municipality within the state to collect a

property tax from its landowners if a plan to do so is proposed by its
governing body and approved by a majority of its eligible voters. The

1182

township is a municipality governed by a Township Council. Pursuant
to the above law, the Township Council proposed a property tax plan
and scheduled a special election for August 15 to submit the plan for
voter approval. The Township Council declared that only persons
owning land within the township were eligible to vote in the special
election and that eligible voters were required to register for that
purpose at the Township Hall between the hours of 1 P.M. and 3 P.M. on
Tuesday, July 15. The constitutionality of the special election was
challenged in an appropriate proceeding by a petitioner with standing.

The petitioner argued that the registration schedule was
discriminatory, proving that a substantial percentage of persons who
owned land in the township were males who commuted to work in a
city 45 miles away and were unable to register during the scheduled
hours without missing a day's work and incurring a loss of income. In
response, the Township Council argued that the registration schedule
had a rational basis, proving that its timing allowed the process to be
carried out with volunteer labor that would save the Township the cost
of hiring special registration personnel. If these are the only arguments
made, the court should declare the registration schedule invalid
because

(A) it discriminates against commuters on the basis of their lifestyle.

(B) it discriminates on the basis of wealth by excluding those who

cannot afford to lose a day's work.

(C) it results in benign sex discrimination.

(D) the right to vote is a fundamental right.

172. The landlord, the owner of a seven-story office building, leased the

entire sixth floor to an attorney for a period of five years by a written
lease that fixed the rent at $2,000 per month. There were only two
offices on the sixth floor, identified as Office 6A and Office 6B. A
clause in the lease provided that in the event it ever became necessary
to determine how the rent payments were apportioned, it was
understood that $900 of each month's rent was to be applied to Office
6A, $900 was to be applied to Office 6B, and $200 was to be applied
to the hallways and other common areas. The lease prohibited
assignment by the attorney without the landlord's written permission
and provided that such permission would not be unreasonably
withheld.

1183

One year after executing the lease, the attorney entered into a written
agreement with a second attorney. Under its terms, the second attorney
was to occupy Office 6A for the balance of the attorney's term at a
monthly rental of $1,500 payable to the attorney. The second attorney
was an attorney with a better reputation and a more lucrative practice
than the first attorney's.

The landlord consented to the arrangement between the two attorneys,
but one month before the term expired, the second attorney vacated the
premises and made no further payments. After the second attorney
moved out, the office that the second attorney had occupied remained
vacant. For the final month of the lease term, the first attorney paid
only $1,100 to the landlord, although the landlord demanded an
additional $900. In an appropriate proceeding, the landlord can
collect $900 from

(A) the first attorney only.

(B) the second attorney only.

(C) Either attorney.

(D) Neither attorney.

173. A woman sued a company in federal district court in State A after she
was injured by one of the company's products. After trial, the jury
ruled in favor of the woman and awarded her damages.

If the trial judge believed the compensatory damages awarded by the
jury were inadequate because the jury was prejudiced against the
woman, what should she do?

(A) Amend the judgment through additur.

(B) Offer the defendant a choice between a higher damage award or a

new trial.

(C) Order a new trial.

(D) Enter judgment as a matter of law.

174. The owner of one piece of land granted an easement to his neighbor,

the owner of the adjacent piece of land. The easement allowed the
neighbor to use a 12-foot-wide strip of the owner's land to drive his
car from his property to the public highway. The strip crossed a
bridge, but the easement document was silent regarding any repairs to

1184

it. After the grant of the easement, the bridge washed out. The neighbor
asked the owner who granted him the easement to repair the bridge,
and he refused to do so. Does the owner who granted the easement
have a duty to repair the bridge?

(A) No, because the owner of the servient estate is not required to

repair or maintain the property used in the easement.

(B) No, but he will have to reimburse his neighbor if his neighbor

chooses to repair it.

(C) Yes, because without the bridge, the neighbor has no way to get to

the public highway.

(D) Yes, because he expressly granted an easement for his neighbor to

be able to reach the highway.

175. The plaintiff was hired as a probationary employee by an agency of the
state pursuant to a written contract. The contract provided that at the
end of one year, the parties could agree to renew the contract for an
additional one-year period, but that either party could, without cause,
elect not to renew.

Eleven months after hiring him, the agency informed the plaintiff in
writing that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the year.
The plaintiff asked the agency for a hearing on his fitness to be
rehired, but his request was denied. The plaintiff subsequently
instituted a proceeding to challenge the decision of the agency on the
ground that its failure to hold a hearing before deciding not to rehire
him violated his right to due process.

If it was the only one true, which of the following additional facts or
inferences would be most likely to lead to an order requiring the
agency to hold a hearing before deciding not to rehire the plaintiff?

(A) During the same year, the agency held hearings before deciding

whether to rehire certain other probationary employees.

(B) The decision not to rehire the plaintiff was based in part on the fact
that, while employed by the agency, he had actively campaigned for
a political candidate.

(C) The decision not to rehire the plaintiff was likely to damage the

plaintiff's reputation.

1185

(D) The job held by the plaintiff was vital to the efficient operation of

the agency.

176. While the defendant and his wife were standing in line outside a movie
theater, the defendant whispered to his wife that he had committed a
series of robberies the previous week. The defendant was
subsequently arrested and charged with the robberies in a jurisdiction
that holds that confidential marital communications are privileged.

The wife is called as a prosecution witness, and the prosecutor
attempts to question her about the statement that the defendant made to
her while they were waiting in the movie line. Which of the following
statements is most correct?

(A) The court should exclude this testimony if the wife is willing to

testify but the defendant objects to her testimony.

(B) The court should exclude this testimony even if the defendant and

his wife make no objection to it.

(C) The court should exclude this testimony even if the defendant and 

his wife make no objection to it, 
or if the wife is willing to testify but the defendant objects to her
testimony.

(D) The court should admit the testimony.

177. The defendant showed his silver coins to the plaintiff and asked

whether the plaintiff would be interested in trading them for chickens.
After inspecting the coins, the defendant and the plaintiff placed them
in a bag that they sealed together and left with a banker whom they
both knew. Then, in a writing signed by both of them, they agreed to the
trade.

Pursuant to the terms of their agreement, the plaintiff was to deliver
6,000 fryer chickens to the defendant on July 1, at which time the bag
of coins would be turned over to the plaintiff as payment in full. In
May, weather conditions were such that the price of fryer chickens
increased to three times what it had been when the agreement was
signed.

In May, the plaintiff notified the defendant that because of the increase
in the price of chickens, the plaintiff would not be able to accept the
bag of coins as payment for 6,000 fryer chickens in July. The

1186

defendant immediately sold the coins to a third person. On July 1, the
plaintiff attempted to deliver 6,000 fryer chickens to the defendant, but
the defendant refused to accept delivery. If the plaintiff asserts a claim
against the defendant for breach of contract, the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the plaintiff said that she would not accept

the coins as payment for the chickens.

(B) the defendant, because the defendant's sale of the coins has resulted

in the defendant's prospective inability to perform.

(C) the plaintiff, because the sale of the coins by the defendant has

made performance by the defendant impossible.

(D) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff tendered the chickens as required

by the contract.

178. While out hunting for wolves, the defendants saw a large furry animal

that they believed was a wolf running through the trees. The defendants
opened fire, killing the creature. When they got closer, they realized
they had just shot a dog that was owned by a local farmer. The dog did
in fact look exactly like a wolf. The farmer sued the defendants for
damages, and the defendants countered that they shot the dog by
mistake and were acting in good faith. What result?

(A) The defendants are not liable for the farmer's damages because

their mistake was made in good faith.

(B) The defendants are not liable for the farmer's damages because

their mistake was reasonable.

(C) The defendants are liable for the farmer's damages because it is

unreasonable to mistake a dog for a wolf.

(D) The defendants are liable for the farmer's damages even though they

may have been acting in good faith.

179. After many residents of the state complained of being annoyed by calls
received from robocall computers, the state legislature enacted a
statute that prohibited operating such a device from within the state.

The company, a manufacturing company doing business in the state,
planned to use the robocall computer to market its products within the
state. After passage of the law, the company attempted to hire an out-
of-state company to set up a robocall computer system connected to
phone lines outside the state for the purpose of making calls to

1187

telephones within the state. When the company learned that the cost of
doing so would far exceed the cost of setting up such a system inside
the state, the company challenged the constitutionality of the state law.

The company's only claim is that the statute violates the First
Amendment protection of freedom of expression. The company's most
effective argument in support of that conclusion is that the statute is

(A) overbroad because it could interfere with non-commercial

communications as well as with commercial communications.

(B) content-related because it is more likely that the telephone
solicitation computer would be used for commercial
communications than for non-commercial communications.

(C) likely to have a chilling effect on expression because of the

increased cost of using the telephone solicitation computer from
locations outside the state.

(D) not justified because prohibiting use of the telephone robocall

computer from locations within the states does not directly advance
a substantial government interest.

180. The farmer was the owner of a small farm that had been in his family

for many generations and which had become a well-known community
landmark. The farmer had a son and a daughter. Because the farmer
was advanced in age, he was concerned about what would happen to
the property after his death. He wanted to keep it in the family for as
long as possible, and he wanted the son to have the use of it throughout
his lifetime.

The farmer died, leaving a will that devised the property “to my son
for life, but if within 40 years my son attempts to sell or mortgage his
interest, to my daughter for life.” If, in an appropriate proceeding, the
son challenges the validity of the restrictions on his estate, his most
effective argument would be that the restrictions

(A) constitute a disabling restraint on alienation.

(B) constitute a forfeiturial restraint on alienation.

(C) constitute a promissory restraint on alienation.

(D) violate the Rule Against Perpetuities.

181. A police officer was going door-to-door in a neighborhood handing

1188

out flyers related to several recent burglaries. A homeowner invited
the police officer in for some coffee. The police officer sat down in
the living room while the homeowner went into the kitchen to get the
coffee. While the officer was sitting there, he noticed a large gun case
on the floor. The case wasn't locked, so he opened it. Inside was a
fully automatic machine gun, which was unlawful in the state. The
police officer arrested the homeowner. The homeowner moved to have
the evidence against her suppressed.

Should the evidence be suppressed?

(A) Yes, because the homeowner was not in the room when the officer

opened the case.

(B) Yes, because the homeowner did not give the officer permission to

open the case.

(C) No, because the homeowner had invited the officer into her home.

(D) No, because the illegality of the evidence was readily apparent.

182. After determining that the health insurance plan could be operated less

expensively if it did not include persons over the age of 65, the state
legislature passed a compulsory retirement law requiring state
employees to retire at the age of 65.

The plaintiff, an employee of the state, sued, claiming that she reached
65 several years after the passing of the new law.

The plaintiff's only argument was that the mandatory retirement law
violated the Obligation of Contracts Clause of Article I of the United
States Constitution. If it was the only one true, which of the following
additional facts or inferences would best support the plaintiff's claim?

(A) The plaintiff was a state employee prior to the time the mandatory

retirement law was passed.

(B) The plaintiff borrowed money for the purchase of a retirement

home, planning to pay it back from his salary as a state employee.

(C) The plaintiff is as physically fit as the average person who is 60

years of age.

(D) The plaintiff's job as a state employee does not require any

physical labor or strain.

1189

183. After executing a contract with the defendant, the plaintiff advertised

that he would be showing the defendant's world-famous hog at the state
fair. All his advertising emphasized that the hog, the American
champion, would be exhibited at the fair. On June 20, the hog
contracted a highly contagious and frequently fatal disease of hogs.
The defendant notified the plaintiff on June 22 that, because of the
disease, he could not exhibit the hog as agreed. When the plaintiff
advised the public that the hog would not be appearing, many people
who had planned to purchase tickets changed their minds and did not
do so. The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim against the defendant
for damages resulting from the defendant's refusal to exhibit the hog as
agreed.

Which of the following additional facts, if it were the only one true,
would be most likely to result in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff?

(A) On May 1, the defendant was aware that many hogs in the area had

contracted the hog disease.

(B) On June 21, the state learned that the hog had contracted the hog
disease and issued an order prohibiting the exhibition of the hog.

(C) On June 22, the defendant owned a hog with qualities equivalent to

the other hogs.

(D) On the day of the trial, the plaintiff could prove exactly how much
revenue the plaintiff lost as a result of the defendant's failure to
exhibit the hog.

184. The tenant leased a parcel of real estate from the landlord for one year
at a monthly rent of $2,000 with an option to buy it for a specified
price at the termination of the lease. After moving onto the realty, the
tenant erected a storage building on it. The construction cost of the
building was $6,000, but when it was completed, its value was
$8,000. The tenant's employer subsequently transferred him to a
company office located in a different state. As a result, the tenant
vacated the realty four months before the expiration of the lease,
advising the landlord that he would not exercise his purchase option.
On the same day, the landlord conveyed the property to the buyer.

The buyer moved onto the realty on the day the tenant vacated it, and
all parties agreed that therefore the tenant would have no further
obligation to pay rent. If the tenant wishes to remove the storage

1190

building, but the landlord and the buyer object, which of the following
statements is correct?

(A) The landlord and the buyer may prevent removal of the building by
declaring it to be realty and tendering its reasonable value to the
tenant.

(B) If a court prevents the tenant from removing the building, declaring
it has been annexed to the realty, the tenant is entitled to receive its
reasonable value from the landlord or the buyer.

(C) The landlord and the buyer may prevent the removal of the building
by declaring it to be realty and tendering its reasonable value to the
tenant, and if a court prevents the tenant from removing the
building, declaring it has been annexed to the realty, the tenant is
entitled to receive its reasonable value from the landlord or buyer.

(D) If the building has become part of the realty, the landlord and the

buyer owe nothing.

185. The company is the manufacturer of an agricultural insecticide. Since
the county in which the company is located is primarily devoted to
farming, the company has manufactured the agricultural insecticide at
its factory there for the past 50 years. Although the insecticide is an
important product commonly used by farmers for the control of an
insect highly destructive to food crops, only three other companies
have a similar product.

Due to the manufacture of the insecticide, fumes that issue from the
company factory frequently have an unpleasant odor. These fumes
cause no physical harm to persons, property, or crops, but residents of
the county frequently complain about the foul smell. All the factories
that manufacture a product similar to the insecticide produce the same
odor.

The farmer began growing crops on a field near the company factory
less than a year ago. The farmer leases the field from its owner in
return for a percentage of his crop. When he telephoned the company
to complain about the bad smell emanating from its factory, a company
official told him that nothing could be done about it.

The farmer asserts a claim against the company based on private
nuisance, seeking damages for discomfort that he experiences as a

1191

result of the bad smell produced by the company's factory. Which one
of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one
true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the company?

(A) There is no other factory within 1,000 miles that manufactures a

product similar to the insecticide.

(B) The farmer does not own realty in or reside in the county.

(C) It is impossible to manufacture a product similar to the insecticide

without producing a bad smell.

(D) The farmer's discomfort does not differ substantially from the
discomfort experienced by other residents of the county.

186. At the jury trial of an action by the bank against the defendant on a

promissory note, the defendant testified that the signature on the note
was not his. An employee of the bank testified that she recognized the
signature as the defendant's.

The defendant's attorney asserts that the promissory note is hearsay.
The bank's most effective response to that assertion would be that

(A) the promissory note is a business record.

(B) the promissory note is an original document.

(C) the promissory note is not being offered to prove that any statement

that it contains is true.

(D) the defendant is in court.

187. Three men all agreed to carry loaded fully automatic machine guns for
a robbery of a pharmacy. The men entered the pharmacy, and to scare
everyone, one of the men fired about 30 bullets into the ceiling. The
pharmacy was in an antique building with a tin ceiling. A bullet
ricocheted off the metal and killed a customer. All three men were
arrested and charged with murder. The jurisdiction does not apply the
felony-murder rule. What is the most severe crime committed by the
two men who did not shoot into the ceiling?

(A) Conspiracy.

(B) Involuntary manslaughter.

(C) Voluntary manslaughter.

(D) Depraved-indifference murder.

188. A stockbroker brought an action in federal district court in State A

against a car salesman after the stockbroker was injured while taking a
test drive in a new car he was thinking about buying. The stockbroker,
a citizen of State A, sought $1 million in damages. The salesman was a
citizen of State B. The salesman brought a counterclaim against the
stockbroker for damages he claimed he received during the same
accident. The salesman joined to the counterclaim the car dealer he
was working for at the time of the accident. The car dealer was a
citizen of State B. The salesman claimed the car dealer and the
stockbroker were both liable to him for $50,000 in damages based on
the accident. The salesman also joined to the counterclaim a claim for
breach of contract against the car dealer because the car dealer fired
him shortly after the accident.

May the court hear the salesman's claim for breach of contract?

(A) Yes, because the claim is part of the same case or controversy.

(B) Yes, because the federal court would have supplemental

jurisdiction over the related claim.

(C) No, because the counterclaim would contain additional facts from

the main claim.

(D) No, because the salesman and the dealer are citizens of the same

state.

189. An astronaut, who is a resident of the Western District of State A, sued
an engineer, who was a resident of the Eastern District of State B, and
a videogame designer, who was a resident of the Southern District of
State C, in federal district court for damages related to an automobile
accident. The accident occurred in the Western District of State D. The
astronaut brought suit in the Western District of State A. After the
defendants submitted their answers, they realized venue was improper
and moved to have the case transferred to the Western District of State
D. However, the district judge found that in the interest of
convenience, the district court in the Western District of State A should
hear the case.

Is venue proper in the Western District of State A?

(A) No, because neither the defendants nor the accident have any

connection to the Western District of A.

1193

(B) No, because neither defendant is a citizen of State A.

(C) Yes, because the defendants have already filed their answers.

(D) Yes, because venue decisions are discretionary.

190. The defendant and the victim are adults. During an argument, the

defendant slammed a glass door against the victim, causing the victim
to sustain serious cuts on her hand. After the victim received medical
treatment for her injuries, she spoke to the defendant's mother about it.
The victim told the mother that she was thinking of suing the defendant
for her medical expenses, but that if the mother would agree to pay the
victim $250, the victim would make no claim against the defendant for
medical expenses. The mother agreed in writing that she would do so.

Two weeks later, the defendant was prosecuted criminally as a result
of the injuries that he had inflicted on the victim. The victim told the
defendant's mother that the prosecutor had asked the victim to testify
against the defendant at the proceeding. The mother begged her not to.
Finally, the victim said that if the mother gave her an additional $1,000
for her pain and suffering, she would not testify against the defendant.
The defendant's mother orally agreed to do so.

The defendant's mother paid $250 to the victim, but refused to pay an
additional $1,000. If the victim asserts a claim against the defendant's
mother on account of the mother's failure to pay the additional $1,000,
which of the following would be the mother's most effective argument
in defense?

(A) The defendant's mother was not legally obligated to pay for damage

done by her adult son.

(B) The defendant's mother's promise to pay an additional $1,000 to the

victim was not supported by consideration.

(C) The defendant's mother's payment of $250 to the victim was an

accord and satisfaction.

(D) The defendant's mother's promise to pay the debt of the defendant

was not in writing.

191. Following her indictment by a grand jury for bank robbery, the
defendant voluntarily surrendered at police headquarters. After
booking her, police officers advised the defendant that she had a right
to remain silent, that anything she said might be used against her, that

1194

she was entitled to have an attorney present during questioning, and
that if she could not afford an attorney, one would be furnished without
cost to her. The defendant said that she did not wish to answer any
questions until her attorney arrived.

The officers went to lunch and returned to headquarters an hour later.
Upon their return, they ordered the defendant to appear in a lineup for
identification purposes in connection with the bank robbery. At first,
the defendant refused. When the officer threatened to use force to
compel her appearance, however, the defendant appeared without
resisting. Witnesses at the lineup identified her as the bank robber.

Following the lineup, the officers asked the defendant whether she
knew anything about a series of residential burglaries. Although they
did not think that she had committed the burglaries, they thought that
she might know the people who had. The defendant admitted
participating in the burglaries, however. She was subsequently
prosecuted for bank robbery and the burglaries.

If the defendant moves to exclude evidence that she admitted
participating in the burglaries, her motion should be

(A) denied, because the police did not suspect her of being involved in

the burglaries when they asked her about them.

(B) denied, because she received Miranda warnings before being

questioned about the burglaries.

(C) granted, because she stated that she did not wish to answer any

questions until her attorney arrived and did not in any other manner
waive her Miranda rights.

(D) granted, because the police did not advise her that she was

suspected of committing the burglaries before they questioned her
about them.

192. By a properly executed and recorded deed, the landowner conveyed a

parcel of real estate with a building on it as follows:

to the church for so long as the land is used by the church for church
purposes;  and  when  the  land  ceases  to  be  so  used,  to  the  hospital  for
so long as the land shall be used by the hospital for hospital purposes;
and  when  the  land  ceases  to  be  so  used,  to  my  son  if  my  son  is  then
living.

1195

The church moved onto the real estate, using the building as a house of
worship.

Five years after the landowner's conveyance, the size of the
congregation of the church increased, creating the need for more
space. As a result, church officials sold the realty, planning to use the
proceeds to buy a bigger church, and executed a deed purporting to
convey the realty to a real estate development company. In subsequent
litigation to determine the rights of the church, the hospital, and the
company, which of the parties should be found to have a present
possessory interest in the realty?

(A) The company, because the church plans to use the proceeds of the

sale to purchase realty for church use.

(B) The company, because the hospital's interest is void under the Rule

Against Perpetuities.

(C) The hospital, because the conveyance to the company terminated

the estate of the church.

(D) The church, because its conveyance to the company was invalid

under the grant from the landowner.

193. After a nuclear power plant was built in the state, the state passed the
Nuclear Waste Act. The Act regulates the storage of radioactive
wastes and authorizes the construction of radioactive waste storage
facilities at specified locations within the state. Section 40 of the Act
provides that “No radioactive waste storage facility in the state shall
store or accept for storage any radioactive waste resulting from
activities conducted more than five miles from said storage facility.”
All storage facilities within the state that are authorized by the Nuclear
Waste Act are located more than five miles from the state line.

The constitutionality of Section 40 is challenged on the sole ground
that it violates the Commerce Clause. Which of the following
additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one true, would be
most likely to result in a conclusion that Section 40 is constitutional?

(A) Prohibiting the storage of radioactive wastes generated outside the
state reduces the expense of operating nuclear power plants within
the state.

(B) The transportation of radioactive wastes within the state over

1196

distances greater than five miles would pose a significant health
and safety hazard to state residents.

(C) There are only a few locations within the state where radioactive

wastes can be stored safely.

(D) There are many locations outside the state where radioactive

wastes can be stored safely.

194. The security guard of a warehouse was making his rounds after closing

time one night when he found the defendant walking around inside the
warehouse. When the guard asked him what he was doing there, the
defendant replied that he had been driving past the warehouse when he
noticed that its door was open, and that he had entered to report this to
the guard. The guard called the police, and the defendant was arrested
and charged with violating a statute providing that “any person
entering the building of another for the purpose of committing a crime
therein is guilty of burglary.”

At the defendant's trial, the prosecutor tried to prove that the
defendant's van, parked outside the warehouse at the time of the
defendant's arrest, had license plates on it that had been stolen from an
out-of-state vehicle the day before the defendant's arrest.

The prosecutor subsequently offered evidence that the defendant had
previously been convicted of a crime other than burglary. Which of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one true,
would be most likely to result in the exclusion of that evidence?

(A) The defendant testified in his own behalf at the burglary trial and

stated that he had never been convicted of a crime.

(B) The defendant did not testify in his own behalf at the burglary trial.

(C) The defendant's prior conviction was for involuntary manslaughter.

(D) The defendant's prior conviction was rendered in the court of

another state.

195. A man sued a boxer in federal district court in the Western District of
State A for injuries the man sustained during a bar fight. The boxer's
attorney wanted to get a copy of the police report. The police
department was located in the Western District of State A, the same
District in which the fight occurred.

1197

How can the boxer's attorney get a copy of the police report?

(A) Serve a request to produce documents on the police department.

(B) Cause the court clerk to issue a subpoena duces tecum on the police

department.

(C) Serve a notice of deposition on the police officer that wrote the

report.

(D) Serve interrogatories on the police officer that wrote the report.

196. The plaintiff, a dentist, owned an apparatus for putting patients to sleep
while she operated on their teeth. The apparatus consisted of two
canisters, one filled with oxygen and the other filled with anesthetic
gas. By manipulating valves attached to the canisters, the plaintiff used
the apparatus to mix and administer a proper combination of gases to
patients. Noticing that one of the valves was beginning to wear out, the
plaintiff sent the apparatus to its manufacturer for repairs. After fixing
the valve, the manufacturer negligently filled the oxygen canister with
anesthetic gas and the anesthetic gas canister with oxygen.

After the manufacturer returned the apparatus to the plaintiff, she
attempted to use it on a patient. While treating the patient, the plaintiff
decided that it was necessary to administer pure oxygen and
manipulated the valves accordingly. Because of the manufacturer's
error in refilling the oxygen canister with anesthetic gas, however, the
plaintiff administered pure anesthetic instead. As a result, the patient
died in the plaintiff's office.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the manufacturer for mental
suffering that she experienced as a result of the patient's death in her
office, which of the following would be the plaintiff's most effective
argument in support of her claim?

(A) The manufacturer's error was outrageous because it created a high

probability of serious harm.

(B) It was likely that the manufacturer's error would lead the plaintiff to

experience mental suffering.

(C) The plaintiff assumed all risks associated with using anesthetic gas.

(D) There was substantial certainty that the plaintiff would use the

apparatus on a patient.

1198

197. A man told his friend, a druggist, that he was planning to kill his wife

and asked the druggist to help him by furnishing a poison. Although the
druggist did not actually intend to help the man kill his wife, he said
that he would because he did not want his friend to be angry at him.
The druggist gave the man a commonly used antibiotic, telling him that
it was a deadly and undetectable poison. The druggist knew that the
antibiotic was not supposed to be dispensed without a prescription and
that about 2 percent of the people who received it developed an
allergic reaction to it, but he did not believe that it would hurt the wife.
That night while the wife was asleep, the man injected her with the
antibiotic that the druggist had given him. Because she was allergic to
the drug, the wife became seriously ill and nearly died.

If the man is prosecuted for conspiracy to murder his wife, which of
the following would be his most effective argument in defense?

(A) His wife did not die.

(B) The druggist did not believe that the wife would die.

(C) The drug that the man gave his wife was not likely to cause her

death.

(D) The inchoate crime and the substantive crime merge when the
defendant's overt act brings him or her substantially close to
achieving his or her intended result.

198. The defendant was arrested and charged in a state court with the

unlawful possession of a dangerous drug. As his defense, the defendant
asserted that he was an undercover officer employed by the Special
Division of the State Police Department and that he had possessed the
drug lawfully as part of an undercover assignment. During the
presentation of its case, the prosecution called the witness, an official
of the State Police Department. The witness testified that he was the
custodian of a personnel file that contained the names of all
undercover officers employed by the Special Division of the State
Police Department and that he had studied the file before coming to
court. He said that all entries in the file were made by the person who
selected its personnel and issued their assignments when the Special
Division was formed and as new personnel were added.

The prosecution offers the file itself into evidence for the purpose of
showing that it contains no mention whatsoever of the defendant. If the

1199

defendant's attorney objects, the personnel file should be

(A) admitted as a business record.

(B) admitted as past recollection recorded.

(C) excluded, because government documents may only be used against

the government.

(D) excluded, because it calls for an inference to be drawn from

negative evidence.

199. A company brought a claim for violations of federal securities laws
against a bank in federal district court. The case was tried before a
jury. The company's case consisted of one witness: the company
president, who presented a few emails that allegedly proved the
company had been harmed by insider trading committed by the bank.
The bank then presented its case, which included dozens of documents
and several expert witnesses regarding the financial actions taken by
the bank. The experts all agreed that the bank's actions were legal. The
case was then submitted to the jury. The jury found in favor of the
company. The bank made a motion for judgment as a matter of law,
arguing there was no way a reasonable jury could have ruled in favor
of the company.

How should the court rule?

(A) Deny the motion, because the bank provided no new evidence to

dispute the claim.

(B) Deny the motion, because the bank did not move for judgment as a

matter of law before the case was submitted to the jury.

(C) Grant the motion, based on the 

insufficiency of the company's evidence.

(D) Grant the motion, because the jury's decision was clearly

erroneous.

200. A pipe company filed a complaint in state court in State A for breach

of contract against a builder. The company did not serve the builder
then, but emailed a “courtesy copy” of the complaint to one of the
builder's vice presidents. The company officially served the builder
two weeks later. Twenty-nine days after service, but 44 days after
receiving the email, the builder removed the case to federal district
court in State A. The company moved to remand the case to state court.

1200

How should the court rule?

(A) Deny the motion, because the builder removed the claim within 30

days after it was served.

(B) Deny the motion, because the “courtesy copy” was not sent by

certified mail.

(C) Grant the motion, because the builder did not remove the claim

within 30 days of receiving notice of the complaint.

(D) Grant the motion, because the builder did not challenge notice

when it received the initial email.

PRACTICE MBE — A.M. EXAM

PRACTICE MBE — ANSWERS TO A.M.
QUESTIONS

1. D A private citizen or police officer is privileged to use whatever non-
deadly force he or she reasonably believes is necessary to prevent the
escape  of  a  criminal  from  a  crime.  Although  there  is  some  doubt
whether the force used by the man against the robber was reasonable,
or indeed whether it was non-deadly, D is the only argument listed that
could possibly result in an acquittal.

In some jurisdictions, a person defending another against a threat of
immediate bodily harm is privileged to use whatever force the person
being  defended  would  have  been  privileged  to  use.  In  other
jurisdictions,  a  person  defending  another  against  a  threat  of
immediate bodily harm is privileged to use the force that reasonably
appears necessary to the defendant himself or herself. Both A and B
are  incorrect,  however,  because  the  robber  was  in  the  process  of
running away at the time of the man's blow, and therefore the man was
not  defending  the  woman  against  a  threat  of  bodily  harm.  A  person
who  owns  or  is  in  charge  of  property  may  use  reasonable  force  to
protect it. This may privilege the use of force to stop a person who is
in the process of unlawfully carrying that property off. C is incorrect,
however,  because  the  man  was  not  the  owner  or  custodian  of  the
woman's handbag and therefore had no privilege to protect it.

2. D Under FRE 611(b), as well as the common law majority rule, cross-
examination  is  limited  to  matters  to  which  the  witness  testified  on
direct  examination.  Because  the  witness  did  not  testify  about  the
contract,  the  question  asked  by  the  defendant's  attorney  probably
exceeds the scope of cross-examination. Since the trial court is given
discretion  in  determining  how  far  the  scope  of  cross-examination
extends, it is not certain that the court would sustain the objection on
this ground. Of all the arguments listed, however, the one set forth in D
is  the  only  one  that  could  possibly  be  effective  in  support  of  the
objection.

A is incorrect for two reasons: First, the witness was called by the
plaintiff, and therefore she is not the defendant's witness, and second,
under  FRE  607,  a  party  may  impeach  its  own  witness.  A  leading
question  is  one  that  contains  a  suggestion  that  would  cause  the
ordinary  person  to  believe  that  the  questioner  desires  one  answer

1203

instead of another. B  is  incorrect  because  the  question  asked  by  the
defendant's attorney contains no such suggestion and because leading
questions  are  permitted  on  cross-examination.  Argumentative
questions are those that are used to emphasize some point to the jury
rather than to elicit information. Although argumentative questions are
improper,  C  is  incorrect  because  the  question  asked  by  the
defendant's attorney did not seek to emphasize any particular point to
the jury.

3. B For the purpose of discovering weapons or preventing the destruction
of evidence, officers may make an incidental search of a person who
has been lawfully arrested. Thus, if the defendant's arrest was lawful,
the  search  of  her  person  was  lawful  as  an  incident  to  that  arrest.  An
officer may make an arrest without a warrant if there is probable cause
to believe that the person arrested has committed or is in the process
of committing a felony. Thus, if the defendant's proximity to the trunk
gave  the  officers  probable  cause  to  believe  that  she  was  guilty  of
possessing cocaine, her arrest and incidental search were lawful.

Probable cause means a belief that the defendant is guilty, supported
by  facts  that  would  lead  a  reasonable  person  to  entertain  such  a
belief. While it is not certain that the officers had probable cause to
believe  the  defendant  guilty,  the  argument  set  forth  in  B  is  the  only
one  listed  that  might  provide  the  prosecution  with  an  effective
argument in response to the defendant's motion.

It  is  sometimes  said  that  evidence  discovered  by  violating  a
defendant's rights is inadmissible because it is “fruit of the poisonous
tree.” A is incorrect because evidence so classified is excluded, not
admitted. Many states hold that officers executing a warrant to search
premises  are  entitled  to  frisk  all  persons  present  for  weapons.  The
frisk,  however,  consists  of  a  patting  down  of  the  outside  of  the
clothing and does not justify reaching into pockets unless the patdown
has  revealed  something  that  feels  like  a  weapon.  Since  there  is  no
indication that the bag of marijuana felt like a weapon, C is incorrect.
D  is  incorrect  because  although  a  warrant  to  search  premises  might
authorize a search of persons present, it does not justify their arrest
unless there is probable cause to believe that they have committed or
are committing a felony.

4.  D  To  be  enforceable,  a  contract  requires  mutuality  of  assent.  If  both
parties are mistaken about a basic assumption of their agreement (i.e.,

1204

there  is  a  bilateral  mistake),  there  is  no  mutuality  of  assent  and  no
enforceable  agreement  can  be  formed.  Both  the  seller  and  the  buyer
believed  that  they  were  contracting  for  the  purchase  and  sale  of  one
parcel of realty, when in fact the written contract identified a different
parcel of realty. Their bilateral mistake thus prevented the mutuality of
assent necessary to make their “contract” enforceable.

If  the  mistake  had  been  the  seller's  alone  (i.e.,  unilateral),  it  would
not have prevented the formation of a contract unless the buyer knew
or  should  have  known  about  it.  For  this  reason,  if  the  buyer  had
known that the parcel described in the writing (#341) had a building
on  it,  while  the  parcel  that  he  had  inspected  (#241)  did  not,  the
seller's mistake would have prevented the formation of a contract. A
is incorrect, however, because the buyer did not know this at the time
the  writing  was  signed.  If  the  only  mistake  in  the  formation  of  a
contract is made by an intermediary chosen by one of the parties, that
mistake is charged to the party who selected the intermediary. (If, for
example, the attorney had said, “My client wants to buy #341,” and
the seller and the buyer had agreed on a price for #341, then the buyer
would  have  been  obligated  to  buy  #341  because  his  unilateral
mistake would not have prevented the formation of a contract.) In this
case,  however,  the  error  was  bilateral  —  both  the  seller  and  the
buyer  believed  that  they  were  contracting  for  the  purchase  of  a
different parcel. For this reason, B is incorrect. C is incorrect for two
reasons: First, if the seller's mistake had been unilateral, the fact that
she would suffer a substantial loss as a result would not be enough to
free  her  of  obligations  under  the  contract,  and  second,  the  bilateral
mistake  regarding  a  basic  assumption  of  the  contract  prevented  the
formation of an enforceable contract for the sale of #341 whether it
was more valuable than #241 or not.

5.  D  The  First  Amendment  prohibits  laws  that  interfere  with  the  free
exercise  of  religion.  A  law  that  makes  a  benefit  available  to  some
people  but  denies  it  to  others  because  of  their  religious  affiliations
may violate this provision because it imposes a burden on the exercise
of  a  religious  belief.  In  1978,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court
specifically  held  (McDaniel  v.  Paty,  435  U.S.  618  (1978))  that  a
statute  that  prohibited  members  of  the  clergy  from  running  for  public
office  was  invalid  for  this  reason.  Even  without  this  decision,
however, the argument set forth in D is the only one listed that could
possibly support the plaintiff's position.

1205

Although a state may not set qualifications for state office that violate
rights  protected  by  the  United  States  Constitution,  there  is  no
constitutional  requirement  that  qualifications  for  state  office  be
consistent  with  qualifications  for  federal  office.  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  statute  in  question  does  not
attempt to set qualifications for practicing members of the clergy. C is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  although  the  creation  of  political
divisiveness along religious lines may make a law invalid under the
Establishment  Clause,  this  is  not  relevant  to  rights  protected  by  the
Free Exercise Clause, and second, prohibiting members of the clergy
from holding public office is not likely to have that effect.

6. A If the long-arm statute of the state in which the federal district court sits
permits a certain type of service against an out-of-state defendant, the
federal district court will permit that type of service as well. See Fed.
R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1).

Therefore, B, C, and D are incorrect.

7.  C  The  privilege  of  self-defense  excuses  a  defendant  from  criminal
liability when he or she is using reasonable force to protect himself or
herself  against  the  commission  of  a  crime.  One  is  never  justified  in
using  deadly  force  in  self-defense,  however,  unless  he  or  she
reasonably  believes  that  he  or  she  is  in  imminent  danger  of  death  or
great  bodily  injury.  The  defendant  was  not  justified  in  slapping  the
victim's  face;  however,  if  the  victim  exceeded  his  privilege  of  self-
defense when he began loading his pistol in apparent retaliation, this
made him the aggressor. If the defendant then had a reasonable (even
though mistaken) belief that his life was in danger, he was justified in
using deadly force to defend himself.

During the course of a fight, the role of aggressor may shift from one
person  to  the  other.  Although  a  person  is  not  privileged  to  defend
himself or herself against a privileged (i.e., reasonable) response to
his or her own aggression, he or she is privileged to defend himself
or herself against an unprivileged attack. Although the defendant was
the  initial  aggressor,  he  may  have  been  privileged  to  use  force  to
defend himself against the victim's response to the slap if the victim's
response was excessive (i.e., unprivileged). A is therefore incorrect.
What force is reasonable in self-defense depends not so much on the
facts as upon the way the facts were perceived by the defendant and
how they would have been perceived by the reasonable person in the

1206

defendant's  position.  Thus,  even  in  jurisdictions  that  require  a
defendant to make reasonable attempts to escape before using lethal
force in self-defense, the fact that the defendant could have escaped
would  not  be  relevant  unless  the  reasonable  person  in  his  shoes
would  have  realized  that.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because  a  determination  of  what  force  is  reasonable  in  self-defense
depends  on  the  state  of  mind  of  the  defendant,  not  on  that  of  the
victim.

8.  A  Under  the  collateral  source  rule,  sums  that  a  plaintiff  receives  from
anyone  other  than  a  tortfeasor  or  a  tortfeasor's  representative  are  not
relevant in determining the amount of damages to which the plaintiff is
entitled.  This  is  because  a  benefit  that  is  given  to  an  injured  person
should not be used to the advantage of the person who injured him or
her. Since the insurance company paid under a policy that the plaintiff
had purchased, the defendant should not derive a benefit from it by the
reduction of damages that he is required to pay.

If  a  plaintiff  has  received  payment  from  a  tortfeasor  (e.g.,  in
settlement),  the  amount  of  such  payment  may  be  deducted  from  the
plaintiff's  damage  to  reduce  the  liability  of  other  tortfeasors.  B  is
incorrect  since  this  is  true  whether  or  not  such  payment  was  made
pursuant  to  a  judicial  determination.  C  is  incorrect  under  the
collateral source rule for the reasons stated above. Ordinarily, when
one joint tortfeasor pays more than his or her fair share of a judgment,
he or she is entitled to recover part of it from other joint tortfeasors.
Some  jurisdictions  base  this  recovery  on  equal  apportionment,
referring  to  it  as  “contribution”  between  joint  tortfeasors.  Other
jurisdictions  base  this  recovery  on  the  relative  fault  of  the  joint
tortfeasors, referring to it as “partial indemnity.” Since the insurance
company was not a joint tortfeasor with the defendant, use of the term
partial indemnity is not applicable. D is therefore incorrect.

9. B Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  it  was  supported  by
consideration. Consideration is something of value given in exchange
for the promise. Since the defendant gave nothing of value in return for
the plaintiff's agreement to release her, his agreement was unsupported
by  consideration  and  is  therefore  unenforceable.  A  novation  is  an
agreement  to  substitute  the  performance  of  a  third  party  for  that  of  a
promisor coupled with the promisee's express agreement to release the
original  promisor  from  further  obligation.  In  a  novation,  the  third

1207

party's  promise  to  perform  for  the  promisee  is  consideration  for  the
promisee's agreement to release the original promisor. (For example,
X and Y have a contract requiring Y to perform. X, Y, and Z then agree
that  Z  will  perform  instead  of  Y,  and  Y  is  released  from  further
obligation. Z's promise to perform is consideration for X's agreement
to release Y.) A court could find that there was no novation in this case
because  the  daughter's  promise  to  perform  had  already  been  made,
and, therefore, it was not given in return for (i.e., as consideration for)
the plaintiff's agreement to release the defendant. While it is not certain
that a court would come to this conclusion, the argument given in B is
the only one listed that might be effective in response to the defendant's
claim.

The  parol  evidence  rule  prohibits  evidence  of  a  prior  or
contemporaneous oral agreement to contradict or modify the terms of
certain  writings.  Since  the  plaintiff's  oral  agreement  to  release  the
defendant was made after  their  written  contract,  the  parol  evidence
rule  does  not  apply  to  it.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  original
contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was for a three-year
period (i.e., could not be performed within a year). For that reason,
the Statute of Frauds required it to be in writing. Since the plaintiff's
agreement  to  release  the  defendant  had  instant  effect,  however,  the
Statute  of  Frauds  does  not  apply  to  it.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.
Accord  occurs  when  contracting  parties  agree  to  substitute  a  new
obligation  for  an  existing  one;  satisfaction  occurs  when  that  new
obligation  is  fulfilled.  Since  the  defendant's  delegation  to  her
daughter did not create any new obligation between the plaintiff and
the  defendant,  it  was  not  an  accord;  thus,  there  could  have  been  no
satisfaction. D is therefore incorrect.

10. A Issue preclusion (also known as collateral estoppel) bars a party from
re-litigating  issues  that  were  actually  litigated  and  necessary  for  the
judgment  in  the  first  action.  Here,  the  doctor's  potential  negligence
was  litigated  in  the  first  case  and  it  was  necessary  to  the  decision
because State A rules stated that any negligence on the doctor's part
would  bar  him  from  recovery.  Since  the  court  found  in  favor  of  the
doctor,  it  necessarily  found  that  the  doctor  was  not  negligent  in  any
way.

B  is  incorrect  because  a  subsequent  action  may  not  necessarily  be
barred even if it arose from the same transaction or occurrence. C is

1208

incorrect because, although the action did not have to be brought as a
compulsory counterclaim, the truck driver could still be collaterally
estopped from forcing the doctor to re-litigate the negligence issue. D
is incorrect because the fact the truck driver is bringing his action in
the same state court would not allow the truck driver to re-litigate the
negligence issue.

11.  B  Freedom  of  association  is  a  corollary  of  the  First  Amendment
freedoms  of  expression  and  assembly.  For  this  reason,  it  has  been
held  that  neither  the  federal  nor  the  state  government  can  impose  a
disability  on  a  person  as  a  result  of  membership  in  an  organization
unless the organization advocates illegal conduct and the person is an
active member who knows the organization's unlawful purposes and
specifically intends to further them. Since the law in question would
impose a disability (i.e., ineligibility for federal employment) solely
because  of  membership  in  an  organization,  without  regard  to
knowledge of the organization's purposes or the intent to further those
purposes, it is unconstitutional.

An ex post facto  law  is  one  that  imposes  a  criminal  penalty  on  the
basis  of  something  that  occurred  before  the  law  was  passed.  Since
the law in question does not impose a criminal penalty, it is not an ex
post  facto  law.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Whether  government
employment is a privilege or a right, ineligibility for it is a disability.
Since  the  disability  cannot  be  constitutionally  imposed  for  mere
membership in an organization, C is incorrect. D may be incorrect for
several  reasons,  but  at  least  because  the  law  does  not  take  into
account the views held by the persons to which it applies.

12. C The  federal  government  is  immune  from  taxation  by  the  states.  It  is
generally  understood,  however,  that  this  immunity  does  not  shield
private  parties  from  state  tax  liability,  even  though  they  have  a
contractual  relationship  with  the  federal  government.  Although
Congress has the power to specifically exempt a particular contractor
from  state  sales  tax  liability,  there  is  no  fact  here  indicating  that
Congress exercised that power.

A  state  attempt  to  regulate  interstate  commerce  may  violate  the
Commerce  Clause  of  the  United  States  Constitution.  A  is  incorrect,
however,  because  a  sales  tax  imposed  on  the  purchase  of  materials
used  to  build  a  bridge  does  not  regulate  interstate  commerce,  even
though  interstate  vehicles  may  eventually  use  the  bridge.  While  the

1209

state  lacks  power  to  tax  the  federal  government,  B  is  incorrect
because so long as it does not discriminate against them, the state is
free to tax persons doing business with the federal government. This
has  been  held  to  be  so  even  though  the  cost  of  such  taxes  may
eventually  be  passed  along  to  the  federal  government  via  cost-plus-
fixed-profit contracts. D is therefore incorrect.

13. A A person seeking to protect a legitimate interest is privileged to make
defamatory  statements  that  he  or  she  reasonably  believes  to  be  true,
under circumstances where the publication is reasonable in its scope.
Clearly, a doctor has a legitimate interest in attempting to prevent the
hiring  of  incompetent  nurses  by  a  hospital.  Since  the  defendant's
response  to  the  personnel  department  questionnaire  was  likely  to
reach only those people who could decide whether or not to hire the
plaintiff,  it  was  probably  reasonable  in  scope.  Also,  because  the
other  doctor  was  a  well-respected  trainer  and  mentor  of  nurses,  it
was likely reasonable to believe his statements regarding the nurse's
competence.  Therefore,  because  the  defendant  reasonably  believed
the statement, it was privileged, and the defendant would not be liable
for defamation.

The publication of a false defamatory statement — unless privileged
— ordinarily results in liability, even though the publisher heard the
statement from another and so indicates when making the statement. B
is  therefore  incorrect.  The  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  has
held  that  a  plaintiff  who  is  a  public  person  may  prevail  in  a
defamation  action  only  by  proving  that  the  defendant  had  “actual
malice.” C is incorrect, however, because the Court has stated that, in
a defamation action, “actual malice” means that when publishing the
statement,  the  defendant  either  knew  that  it  was  false  or  entertained
serious  doubts  about  its  truth.  C  is  also  incorrect  because  actual
malice alone is not sufficient to result in defamation liability. In some
defamation  actions,  the  plaintiff  must  prove  that  the  defendant's
publication  resulted  in  actual  damage  to  the  plaintiff.  Proof  of
damage,  however,  is  not  sufficient  to  result  in  defamation  liability
where other elements of the plaintiff's case have not been established
or where the defendant was privileged. D is therefore incorrect.

14. D A positive statement by the promisor to the promisee indicating that
the  promisor  will  not  perform  his  or  her  contractual  duty  is  a
repudiation of the contract. Even though performance was not yet due

1210

at the time of repudiation, the non-repudiating party may usually sue
on a theory of anticipatory breach as soon as the repudiation occurs.
Therefore, the seller acquired an immediate right of action as soon as
the buyer communicated that he would not order any boxes in 2012.

A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect for two reasons: First, UCC
the  validity  of  “requirements”
§2-306  specifically  recognizes 
contracts  and  specifies  the  manner  in  which  their  terms  should  be
construed,  and  second,  damages  for  failing  to  order  the  specified
minimum  requirement  could  be  fixed  with  certainty.  A  party  who
seeks  damages  for  breach  of  contract  is  required  to  prove  those
damages;  they  are  not  presumed.  C  is  incorrect  for  this  reason,  and
because — strictly speaking — a repudiation is not a “breach,” but
an “anticipatory breach.”

15. A To prevail in an action for defamation, a plaintiff must prove that the
defendant  published  a  defamatory  statement  about  the  plaintiff.  A
defamatory  statement  is  about  the  plaintiff  if  the  reasonable  person
who  knows  the  plaintiff  would  recognize  the  plaintiff  from  the
statement. For this reason, a defamatory statement made about a group
to  which  the  plaintiff  belongs  identifies  the  plaintiff  so  long  as  the
group is small enough to lead the reasonable person who knows that
the plaintiff is a member of the group to believe that 
the statement about the group is being made about the plaintiff.

The  issue  here  is  what  was  said  in  the  newspaper,  not  whether  the
police  officers  were  engaged  in  their  official  duties  or  not.  This
makes B incorrect. A spoken defamation is called “slander per se” if
it  accuses  the  plaintiff  of  a  crime  of  moral  turpitude,  of  having  a
loathsome disease, of being an unchaste woman, or of being unfit for
the  plaintiff's  occupation.  In  certain  cases  of  slander  per  se,  the
plaintiff  may  be  relieved  of  the  need  to  prove  actual  damage.  C  is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  statement  cannot  be  called
slander  because  it  was  in  writing,  and  second,  calling  a  statement
slander per se does not eliminate the need to prove that the statement
was made about the plaintiff. If the group of police officers present at
the  rally  was  small  enough,  the  statement  about  the  group  identifies
the plaintiffs (for reasons given above) even though it does not name
them. D is therefore incorrect.

16. C If questioning during voir dire reveals a juror is biased, the juror may
be excused for cause. A juror has an actual bias if the juror indicates

1211

he or she would use predetermined beliefs or principles instead of the
facts  presented  to  determine  a  case.  Since  the  woman  stated  she
would have a hard time keeping an open mind because she believed
the  police  habitually  discriminated  against  minorities,  she  can  be
excused for cause.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  question  specifically  asks  about  her
statements. There is no indication any of the attorneys want the juror
dismissed based on her race. B is incorrect because although she said
she had no strong feelings or private knowledge, she did indicate she
had  an  actual  bias  regarding  the  issue  presented  by  the  case.  D  is
incorrect because an implied bias refers to the situation where a juror
states  he  or  she  is  not  biased,  but  an  average  person  in  that  juror's
position would likely be partial to one of the parties (for example, if
one of the parties was related to the juror). Here, the woman stated an
actual bias.

17.  A  Under  FRE  804(b)(2),  a  statement  is  admissible  as  a  dying
declaration if it was made about the cause and circumstances of death
by a presently unavailable declarant with a sense of impending death,
was based upon the declarant's personal knowledge, and is offered at
the  trial  of  a  criminal  homicide  prosecution  or  of  any  civil  action.
Since the plaintiff asked the witness to tell his wife to meet him at the
hospital, it is possible that a court would find that he did not believe
himself to be dying. This conclusion is, of course, not certain (since
he may have been telling her where to claim his body), but A is the
only reason listed that could possibly justify finding that the plaintiff's
statement was not a dying declaration.

B  is  incorrect  because  while  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  (FRE)
require  the  declarant  to  be  unavailable,  it  does  not  require  that  he
have died from the incident described in his statement, or even that he
is  dead.  Although  some  controversy  exists  at  common  law  about
whether a dying declaration is admissible in anything but a criminal
homicide  prosecution,  the  FRE  specifically  permit  its  use  in  a  civil
action.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  common  law  provides  that  an
excited  utterance  may  be  admissible  under  an  exception  to  the
hearsay  rule,  but  only  if  the  statement  was  spontaneous  (e.g.,  not  in
response  to  a  question).  The  FRE  exception  for  excited  utterance
does  not  specifically  mention  spontaneity,  but  some  cases  indicate
that excited utterances should be excluded under the FRE if they were

1212

made  in  response  to  a  question.  D  is  incorrect,  however,  because
neither the common law nor the FRE require that a dying declaration
be made spontaneously.

18. D Under FRE 703, “[i]f experts in the particular field would reasonably
rely  on  those  kinds  of  facts  or  data  in  forming  an  opinion  on  the
subject, they need not be admissible for the opinion to be admitted.”
Consequently,  if  other  experts  in  the  field  would  rely  on  the
maintenance  worker's  statement,  the  expert  may  do  so  even  if  it  is
inadmissible. Therefore, A is incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  the  expert  did  not  interview  the
maintenance  worker  herself  does  not  change  the  analysis.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  expert's  use  of  the  statement  in  her  testimony
does not change the inadmissible statement to an admissible one.

19.  A  Although  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  interprets  the  federal
constitution, it does not have the power to interpret state constitutions.
Therefore, if it reviewed the decision of the state court, it could not
disturb  the  holding  that  the  due  process  requirement  of  the  state
constitution  was  violated.  Since  that  holding  alone  is  sufficient  to
support  the  state  court's  finding  on  behalf  of  the  plaintiff  (i.e.,  the
finding  is  based  on  an  adequate  and  independent  state  ground),  the
United  States  Supreme  Court  lacks  the  power  to  overturn  the  state
court decision. For this reason, review by the United States Supreme
Court is not available. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

20. D Under FRE 803(22), a judgment of conviction may be admissible as
an exception to the hearsay rule. For any evidence to be admissible,
however,  it  must  be  logically  and  legally  relevant.  Whether  a  past
conviction for passing bad checks is logically related to any material
issues  in  the  defendant's  prosecution  is  uncertain,  but  there  is  little
doubt  about  the  legal  relevancy  of  such  evidence.  Because  of  its
capacity  for  arousing  prejudice,  evidence  bearing  on  a  person's
character is not admissible as circumstantial evidence that his or her
conduct  on  a  particular  occasion  was  consistent  with  that  character.
Thus,  the  defendant's  conviction  for  passing  worthless  checks  is
inadmissible if offered to support an inference that because he passed
bad  checks  that  time,  it  is  likely  that  he  did  it  again  this  time.  If  the
crime  charged  had  been  committed  in  a  highly  distinctive  way,
evidence  that  the  defendant  previously  used  that  same  distinctive
modus operandus (MO) would tend to establish that he was familiar

1213

with  it.  It  could  be  admissible  since  its  purpose  would  not  be  to
circumstantially  establish  conduct  by  showing  character.  A  is
incorrect, however, because there is no fact indicating that the crime
with which the defendant is now charged and the crime of which he
was  previously  convicted  involved  the  same  distinctive  MO.  Since
the  fact  that  a  person  has  committed  a  crime  involving  dishonesty
suggests that his or her statements are not worthy of belief, evidence
that a witness has been convicted of such a crime may be admissible
for  the  purpose  of  impeaching  that  witness's  credibility.  Since  the
defendant has not testified, however, his credibility is not in question.
B is therefore incorrect.

the  Rule  Against  Perpetuities  and 

21. A A fee simple subject to an executory limitation allows for an estate to
pass to a third person upon the happening of a stated event. The third
person who may gain the estate holds an executory interest. However,
the  issue  here  is  that  executory  interests  are  subject  to  the  Rule
Against  Perpetuities.  The  Rule  Against  Perpetuities  states  “No
interest  is  good  unless  it  must  vest,  if  at  all,  not  later  than  21  years
after some life in being at the creation of the interest.” Here, since the
friend's interest might not vest until more than 21 years after all lives
in being at the time the landowner conveyed the interest, the executory
interest  violates 
is  void.
Consequently, the county is simply left with a fee simple absolute. B
is  incorrect  because  of  the  executory  interest's  violation  of  the  Rule
Against  Perpetuities.  C  is  incorrect  because,  although  a  fee  simple
subject  to  a  condition  subsequent  also  takes  into  account  the
happening of a certain event, it does not automatically end when the
event occurs. In addition, it is the grantor, not a third party, who has
the  right  to  take  back  the  property.  Phrases  that  create  a  fee  simple
subject  to  a  condition  subsequent  use  words  such  as  “upon  express
condition  that”  or  “provided  that.”  D  is  incorrect  because  a  fee
simple determinable is created by using phrases such as “so long as”
or “until.” Importantly, the grantor is left with a possibility of reverter
if the stated event occurs.

22. D Title passes immediately from the grantor to the grantee once a deed
is  validly  executed  and  delivered.  Consequently,  returning  or
destroying the deed has no effect on the conveyance. If the landowner
wanted  to  get  the  land  back,  he  should  have  required  his  son  to
execute  and  deliver  a  new  deed  to  him.  Therefore,  A  and  B  are
incorrect.

1214

C  is  incorrect  because  whether  or  not  the  son  made  a  photocopy
wouldn't change the analysis.

23.  D  A  professional  seller  who  supplies  a  defective  product  is  strictly
liable for damage that proximately results from the product's defect. A
defect is a proximate cause of harm if it was both a factual and a legal
cause of it. A defect is a factual cause of harm if the harm would not
have occurred without it. Assuming that the vibrations resulted from a
defect, the defect was a factual cause of the neighbor's injury since the
injury would not have occurred without it. A defect is a legal cause of
harm if the harm was a foreseeable result of the defect, not the result
of unforeseeable interventions (i.e., superseding causes). Thus, if the
intervening  conduct  of  the  woman  was  a  superseding  cause  of  the
harm, then the product defect — although a factual cause of the injury
—  was  not  a  legal  cause  of  it.  Although  it  might  take  a  jury  to
determine  whether  the  woman's  conduct  was  unforeseeable  (i.e.,  a
superseding cause), D is the only argument listed that might result in a
judgment for the store.

If all other requirements are satisfied, strict liability may be imposed
to  benefit  any  plaintiff  whose  contact  with  the  product  was
foreseeable,  regardless  of  whether  the  plaintiff  is  classified  as  a
bystander.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  plaintiff  who  voluntarily
encounters a known risk assumes that risk. B  is  incorrect,  however,
because the woman was not the plaintiff, and only a plaintiff is said
to assume a risk. If the processing machine was defective when it left
the  company's  factory,  the  company  might  be  strictly  liable  for  the
neighbor's injuries that proximately resulted. C is incorrect, however,
because  if  the  product  was  defective  when  it  left  the  company's
factory, it must have been defective when it left the store's premises,
making the store strictly liable as well.

24. D A statutory system of classification that regulates social or economic
interests is valid under the Equal Protection Clause if it has a rational
basis. On the other hand, if it discriminates against a suspect class of
persons, it is valid only if it is necessary to serve a compelling state
interest. (Note: To withstand a constitutional challenge based on the
claim that a statute interferes with a fundamental right, the statute must
be necessary to serve a compelling state interest. Since the plaintiff's
challenge  is  not  based  on  that  claim,  however,  the  compelling  state
interest  standard  does  not  apply.)  Although  it  has  been  held  that  a

1215

statutory classification based on gender does not discriminate against
a  suspect  class,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  developed  a
third,  or  middle,  level  of  scrutiny  (sometimes  called  “rational  basis
with  a  bite”)  for  such  classifications.  It  has  been  held  that  gender
classifications  are  valid  only  if  they  are  substantially  related  to  an
important governmental interest. Since the plaintiff's sole claim is that
the statute discriminates against women, the statute would be valid if
it satisfied this middle level of scrutiny. Although it is not certain that
the statute would satisfy the requirements of this test, the argument set
forth  in  D  is  the  only  one  listed  that  might  possibly  be  effective  in
opposition to the plaintiff's claim.

A is incorrect because the fact that a system of classification does or
does not discriminate against a suspect class determines the standard
to  be  applied,  but  it  does  not  itself  determine  whether  the  statute  is
constitutional. B is incorrect because a rational basis is not sufficient
to  make  constitutional  a  statute  that  discriminates  on  the  basis  of
gender. C is incorrect because police powers, like all other powers
of  the  state,  may  not  be  exercised  in  a  way  that  is  inconsistent  with
the United States Constitution.

25. C The terms of a contract may provide that a party's performance is not
required  until  the  happening  of  a  specified  event  (i.e.,  a  condition
precedent). If so, the duty to perform does not become absolute until
that  event  has  occurred  (i.e.,  the  condition  precedent  has  been
satisfied). In this contract, the defendant's duty to make final payment
was  conditioned  upon  the  plaintiff's  obtaining  a  Certificate  of
Satisfactory Completion from the architect prior to July 30. Thus, the
defendant's duty to pay would not become absolute until the plaintiff
satisfied  the  condition  precedent  by  obtaining  the  certificate  by  that
date. It is understood, however, that a party who wrongfully interferes
with  the  other  party's  fulfillment  of  a  condition  may  not  rely  on  that
unfulfilled condition to avoid performing. Sometimes this conclusion
is based on what is referred to as a breach of the “implied promise to
cooperate.”  Sometimes  courts  simply  say  that  wrongful  interference
excuses performance of the condition precedent. Either way, since the
defendant's  request  caused  the  architect  to  delay  issuing  the
certificate,  the  defendant's  duty  to  make  final  payment  may  become
absolute in spite of the plaintiff's failure to fulfill that condition of the
contract.

1216

A  is  incorrect  because  the  architect  was  not  a  party  to  the  contract
between  the  defendant  and  the  plaintiff,  and  that  contract  therefore
could not have imposed duties on the architect. It is sometimes said
that express conditions of a contract must be fully satisfied, but that
“substantial performance” satisfies constructive conditions. Since the
condition requiring the plaintiff to obtain a Certificate of Satisfactory
Completion  by  July  30  was  express,  substantial  performance  would
not  have  been  sufficient.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Sometimes  in  a
contract calling for performance to the satisfaction of the other party,
a dispute arises as to whether that satisfaction is to be subjective or
based  on  objective  standards.  Usually,  in  the  absence  of  a  clear
agreement  to  the  contrary,  the  standard  is  understood  to  be  an
objective one. In this case, however, the express condition required
not only satisfactory completion, but the obtaining of a certificate by a
particular  date.  For  this  reason,  the  application  of  an  objective
standard would not be sufficient to defeat the defendant's claim. D is
therefore incorrect.

26. A One who intentionally aids, abets, or facilitates the commission of a
crime is an accomplice and not only is guilty of the crime that he or
she  aided,  but  also  is  vicariously  liable  for  all  its  reasonably
foreseeable consequences. One who agrees with another to commit a
crime is guilty of conspiracy and is vicariously liable for any crimes
committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy. Since
the  jury  did  not  believe  the  defendant's  testimony,  the  friend  was
committing a robbery when he used a threat of force to steal the coat
from the victim. Since the defendant assisted him in doing so, she was
an accomplice. Since she agreed to do so, she was a co-conspirator.
As an accomplice, she is probably liable vicariously for the friend's
intentional killing of the victim because her knowledge that the friend
would be using a gun to coerce the victim into handing over the coat
probably made it foreseeable that he would shoot the victim with the
gun.  As  a  co-conspirator,  she  is  vicariously  liable  for  the  shooting
since  it  was  clearly  in  furtherance  of  the  robbery  that  she  agreed  to
commit.

B  is  incorrect  because  being  present  while  a  crime  is  committed  is
not sufficient to make a defendant an accomplice or a co-conspirator.
Self-defense is a privilege to use reasonable force to defend oneself
against the use of force. A person who is being shot at may, therefore,
be  privileged  to  defend  himself  or  herself  by  shooting  back.  C  is

1217

incorrect,  however,  because  self-defense  does  not  privilege  the  use
of  force  in  response  to  force  which  itself  was  privileged  by  self-
defense. Since the friend was menacing the victim with a pistol, the
victim  was  privileged  to  use  a  pistol  in  self-defense.  Since  the
victim's use of force was privileged, the friend was not privileged to
use  any  force  in  defense  against  it.  D  is  incorrect  because  as  a  co-
conspirator and accomplice to the crime of robbery, the defendant is
vicariously 
that  was  a  foreseeable
the  shooting 
consequence and done in furtherance of the robbery.

liable  for 

27. D Since the notary received his interest from the neighbor, the validity
of the notary's title depends on the validity of the neighbor's title. For
this reason, if the neighbor's title is superior to the friend's, then the
notary's title is superior to the friend's. The validity of the neighbor's
title  depends  on  the  recording  statute.  The  statute  given  is  a  typical
“notice”  statute.  According  to  its  provisions,  the  interest  of  a
subsequent grantee for value and without notice is superior to that of a
prior grantee unless the prior grantee's interest was recorded prior to
the time the subsequent grantee received his or her interest. Since the
friend's deed was not recorded prior to the landowner's conveyance
to  the  neighbor,  the  neighbor's  interest  is  superior  to  the  friend's.
Since the notary derives his interest from 
the  neighbor's  grant,  the  notary's  interest  is  also  superior  to  the
friend's.

As a result of this reasoning, it is correct to say that one who derives
his or her interest from a bona fide purchaser for value (i.e., BFP) is
protected by a recording statute even if he or she is not a BFP himself
or herself. Thus, the notary's possible knowledge would not deprive
him of the protection of the recording statute, and A is incorrect. B is
incorrect  because  it  fails  to  take  into  account  the  effect  of  the
recording  statute.  While  the  neighbor  did  purchase  for  value,  he
clearly  executed  a  deed  conveying  the  property  to  the  notary.  C  is
therefore incorrect.

28.  B  Under  the  common  law,  rape  consists  of  sexual  intercourse  with  a
female  not  the  wife  of  the  defendant  without  that  female's  consent.
Under  most  statutory  rape  laws,  a  female  below  a  given  age  is
determined to be incapable of consent, meaning that any male who has
sexual  intercourse  with  her  does  so  without  her  consent.  For  this
reason, knowledge of the victim's age is not ordinarily an element of

1218

statutory  rape.  Under  the  statute  given  in  this  question,  however,
knowledge  of  the  female's  age  is  specifically  required.  For  this
reason, the boy could not be convicted if he did not know that the girl
was under the age of 18 years.

So long as a male defendant is old enough to be convicted of a crime,
he may be convicted of statutory rape even though his age is the same
as or younger than that of the female victim. A is therefore incorrect.
Intoxication  is  a  defense  to  a  criminal  charge  only  if  it  made  the
defendant  incapable  of  possessing  the  necessary  state  of  mind
required. C is incorrect because there is no indication that the boy's
intoxication  affected  his  knowledge  regarding  the  girl's  age  or
prevented  him  from  knowing  that  he  was  having  sexual  intercourse
with  her.  Statutory  rape,  of  which  the  crime  charged  is  a  form,  is
based on the concept that certain persons are incapable of consenting
to  sexual  intercourse.  For  this  reason,  the  victim's  consent  never
furnishes a defense, and D is incorrect.

29. C If a plaintiff brings an action in state court that could have originally
been  brought  in  federal  court,  a  defendant  can  have  it  removed  to
federal court. See 28 U.S.C.§1441. Federal courts have subject matter
jurisdiction over claims where the plaintiff and defendant are citizens
of different states and the amount in controversy is over $75,000. The
man is claiming $100,000, so he meets the jurisdictional amount. He
is also a citizen of State A. A corporation is a citizen of the state it is
incorporated  in  and  a  citizen  of  the  state  where  it  has  its  principal
place of business. Courts determine “principal place of business” by
looking  at  where  the  corporation's  top  management  direct  the
corporation's business activities. Consequently, the moving company
is a citizen of State B based on incorporation, and a citizen of State C
based  on  its  principal  place  of  business.  Thus,  there  is  diversity  of
citizenship between the parties, and the moving company can remove
the  claim  to  federal  court  because  it  could  have  originally  been
brought there.

A is  incorrect  because  the  claim  can  still  be  removed  even  if  it  is
based on State A motor vehicle law. B is incorrect because although
the moving company did 70 percent of its business in State A, it is not
a  citizen  of  State  A.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  company's  belief
federal  subject  matter
regarding 
jurisdiction.

fairness  would  not  create 

1219

30.  C  Although  a  defendant's  violation  of  a  statute  may  help  the  plaintiff
establish  that  the  defendant  was  negligent,  that  negligence  does  not
result  in  liability  unless  it  was  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  the
plaintiff's  damage.  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm
would  not  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  obeying  the  speed  limit
was more likely to cause the collapse than exceeding it, the accident
would  have  occurred  if  the  statute  had  been  obeyed.  Since  the
collapse  would  have  occurred  without  it,  the  violation  was  not  a
factual cause of the collapse.

In some jurisdictions, the violation of a statute may be negligence per
se; in others, it may raise a rebuttable presumption of negligence; and
in  others,  it  may  merely  raise  an  inference  of  negligence.  A  is
incorrect,  however,  because  negligence  does  not  result  in  liability
unless it was a factual cause of harm, and the defendant's violation of
a statute — even if it establishes negligence — was not a cause of the
plaintiff's  harm.  Although  violation  of  a  statute  may  raise  a
presumption of negligence, it does not result in any presumption as to
causation  and  is  usually  not  relevant  to  issues  of  causation.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  Unless  the  statute  violated  was  designed  to
protect  a  class  of  persons  that  includes  the  plaintiff,  its  violation  is
not  relevant  to  the  question  of  negligence  at  all.  D  is  incorrect,
however,  because  it  is  generally  understood  that  traffic  laws  are  at
least designed to protect other users of the roads.

31. B Since the condition imposed by the landowner's deed prohibited non-
residential use, the buyer's grant of a license to fish does not violate it
if fishing is a residential use. Whether or not this is so is uncertain,
but B is the only argument listed that could possibly provide the buyer
with an effective defense.

Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good if it can vest
after a particular period of time. The creation of an interest that might
vest after the period is thus void under the Rule, but the Rule has no
effect on the termination of an existing interest. A is incorrect for this
reason and because the Rule Against Perpetuities is not applicable to
future interests of a grantor. The fee simple determinable and the fee
simple subject to a condition subsequent are possessory interests that
may  be  terminated  on  the  happening  of  a  specified  event.  The  most
important difference between them is that the fee simple determinable
terminates  automatically  on  the  happening  of  that  event,  and  the  fee

1220

simple  subject  to  a  condition  subsequent  does  not  terminate  without
some action being taken. The language of the landowner's deed makes
it difficult to determine which of those interests was conveyed to the
buyer, but the difference is insignificant to the buyer since his interest
is  subject  to  termination  in  either  event.  For  this  reason,  C  is
incorrect.  A  restraint  on  alienation  is  a  condition  that  attempts  to
control the alienability (i.e., power to convey an interest) of realty. If
the condition attempts to do so directly (e.g., the condition prohibits
selling  or  mortgaging  the  realty),  it  may  be  declared  void  under
certain  circumstances.  Although  use  restrictions  are  likely  to  affect
the alienability of realty, policy does not require that they be declared
void  for  this  reason  alone  because  their  effect  is  indirect.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

32. D Ordinarily, specific performance is available as a remedy for breach
of  contract  when  damages  would  not  be  an  adequate  remedy.  For
several reasons, however, courts do not grant specific performance of
contracts  calling  for  personal  service.  These  reasons  include  the
involuntary  servitude  and  of
constitutional  protections  against 
freedom of association, as well as practical considerations that make
it unwise for courts to become unduly involved in the supervision of
performance.  Thus,  if  the  architectural  work  that  remained  to  be
completed  involved  personal  services,  specific  performance  would
not be granted.

A is therefore incorrect. An agreement not to assign usually destroys
the  right  but  not  the  power  to  make  an  effective  assignment.  This
means  that  an  assignment  made  in  the  face  of  such  an  agreement  is
usually  valid,  although  the  assignor  might  be  liable  for  damages
resulting  from  the  assignment  and  from  his  or  her  own  failure  to
perform.  For  this  reason,  damages  are  usually  the  only  remedy
available  for  breach  of  a  promise  not  to  assign.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. C is a misstatement of the above rule. While an agreement
not to assign may destroy the right to make a valid assignment (i.e.,
one who violates it may be liable for breach of contract), it does not
ordinarily  destroy  the  power  to  assign  (i.e.,  an  assignment  made  in
violation of the assignor's promise may be valid). For this reason, C
is  incorrect.  (Note:  The  obligation  to  perform  personal  services  is
not  usually  assignable  or  delegable.  This  rule  is  not  relevant  here,
however,  because  the  question  asks  not  about  the  validity  of  the
assignment,  but  about  the  availability  of  specific  performance  as  a

1221

remedy.)

33. A Under FRE 901(5) (and at common law), a voice may be identified by
any  person  who  testifies  that  he  or  she  recognizes  it  based  upon
hearing the voice under circumstances connecting it with the alleged
speaker. Although the plaintiff may not have known whose voice she
was  hearing  when  she  had  the  telephone  conversation,  if  she
subsequently  heard  the  defendant's  voice  and  recognized  it  as  the
same voice that she heard on the telephone, she is competent to testify
that it was the defendant's voice that she heard on the telephone. This
is true even though her first real opportunity to connect the defendant
with the voice occurred on the morning of trial.

If a person's telephone number is listed in the telephone book, there is
a presumption that one who properly dialed that number reached the
premises  of  the  person  listed.  Under  FRE  901(6),  this  presumption
combined  with  other  circumstances,  including  self-identification  of
the speaker as the person listed, may justify the admission of voice-
identification  testimony  by  a  witness  who  dialed  the  number.  Since
the plaintiff did not look up the defendant's number in the telephone
book  or  dial  it,  the  defendant's  self-identification  is  insufficient  to
make the plaintiff's testimony admissible. B is therefore incorrect. C
is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff's  subsequent  hearing  of  the
defendant's  voice  is  sufficient  to  make  her  voice-identification
testimony  admissible.  The  fact  that  the  plaintiff  had  not  dialed  the
defendant's number before speaking to him would prevent her voice-
identification testimony from being admissible under the special FRE
provision  discussed  above  regarding  telephone  identifications.  D  is
incorrect, however, because the fact that she recognized the telephone
voice  as  the  defendant's  after  hearing  the  defendant's  voice  in  the
judge's  chambers  is  sufficient  to  make  her  testimony  admissible
without that special provision.

34. D Since the Act prohibits the operation of munitions factories in which
airborne  levels  of  the  chemical  exceed  statutory  standards,  it  would
take a new law to permit the company's factory to operate in violation
of  those  standards.  In  effect,  by  giving  the  Senate  National  Defense
Committee the power to permit such operation, Section 34 purports to
give  it  the  power  to  make  a  law.  Article  I  of  the  United  States
Constitution provides that federal legislation must be passed by both
houses of Congress and then presented to the President for approval.
An  attempt  to  legislate  without  fulfilling  these  requirements  violates

1222

the Constitution.

The committee system in Congress exists, in part, because it enables
certain  questions  to  be  considered  by  bodies  that  have  had  an
opportunity  to  develop  expertise  in  certain  areas.  The  principle  of
bicameralism  established  by  Article  I  prevents  those  committees
from  legislating,  however.  For  this  reason,  A  is  incorrect.  Although
Congress may supervise the activities of administrative agencies that
it has created, the scope of such supervision is, of course, limited by
the provisions of the Constitution. As indicated above, the system of
supervision created by Section 34 exceeds constitutional limitations
because it purports to give a Senate committee the power to legislate.
B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,
Congress  may  authorize  an  administrative  body  to  impose  quasi-
criminal sanctions (although not to create them), and second, Section
34  does  not  give  an  administrative  agency  the  power  to  impose
sanctions but purports to limit that power.

35. B Extortion  consists  of  obtaining  property  from  another  by  threatening
future  harm  to  persons,  property,  or  economic  interests.  Since  the
defendant obtained money from the victim by threatening to blow up
her real and personal property, he can be convicted of extortion.

Robbery  consists  of  obtaining  property  from  another  by  using  or
threatening force against a person. Since the defendant made no threat
of  harm  to  a  person,  A  is  incorrect.  Larceny  by  trick  is  a  larceny
committed  by  making  a  misrepresentation  that  induces  the  victim  to
part with temporary possession of personal property. Since the victim
did  not  expect  her  cash  to  be  returned,  she  was  not  parting  with
temporary  possession  of  it,  and  C  is  incorrect.  Embezzlement  is  a
criminal conversion of personal property by one in lawful custody of
it.  Since  the  defendant  was  not  in  lawful  custody  of  the  victim's
money, D is incorrect.

36. B Article I, Section 10, provides in part that no state shall pass any law
impairing  the  obligation  of  contracts.  This  prevents  states  from
repudiating  their  own  contractual  obligations  or  interfering  with
private  contractual  obligations  except  by  regulations  that  are
reasonable  and  appropriate  to  a  significant  state  purpose.  Since  the
statute  in  question  does  not  result  in  a  repudiation  of  the  state's
contractual  obligations  or 
interfere  with  private  contractual
obligations, it does not violate the Obligation of Contracts Clause.

1223

it  discriminates  against 

The  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits  states  from  invidiously
discriminating.  Since  the  statute  requires  higher  fees  from  non-
residents, 
them.  Although  some  such
discrimination has been held to be valid, it is possible that this statute
is not. A  therefore  could  be  an  effective  argument  in  support  of  the
constitutional  challenge,  making  A  incorrect.  The  Privileges  and
Immunities  Clause  of  Article  IV  of  the  United  States  Constitution
provides  that  “The  citizens  of  each  state  shall  be  entitled  to  all
privileges and immunities of the citizens in the several states.” Since
this  has  been  held  to  prohibit  certain  discrimination  against  out-of-
staters,  C  also  could  be  an  effective  argument  in  support  of  the
constitutional  challenge  and  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  Commerce
Clause  prohibits  the  states  from  discriminating  against  or  imposing
undue burdens on interstate commerce. Violations have been found on
both  grounds  in  laws  that  denied  to  out-of-staters  advantages  that
were available to state residents. For this reason, D also could be an
effective argument and is therefore incorrect.

37.  B  An  assault  is  committed  by  intentionally  inducing  the  plaintiff's
reasonable apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact. It
has been held that a threatening act is not an assault if accompanied
by words that make clear that the threat will not be carried out, since
any  apprehension  experienced  by  the  plaintiff  would  not  be
reasonable. It is understood, however, that a defendant is not free to
avoid assault liability by demanding compliance with a condition that
he  or  she  has  no  legal  right  to  impose.  Since  the  defendant  had  no
legal  right  to  require  the  seller  to  back  out  of  his  contract  with  the
buyer, the fact that he told the seller that he could avoid the threatened
harm by doing so would not prevent the defendant from being liable
for assault. B is therefore not an effective argument in the defendant's
defense and is therefore correct.

Since  it  was  obvious  from  the  defendant's  statement  that  the
threatened  harm  would  not  occur  until  sometime  in  the  future,  A
would  be  an  effective  defense  and  is  therefore  incorrect.  Since  the
threat  was  of  harm  to  the  seller's  children  and  not  to  the  seller,  C
would be an effective defense and is therefore incorrect. Courts have
generally argued (although this argument is not always credible) that
apprehension  induced  by  the  defendant's  mere  use  of  words  is  not
reasonable. This has led to a rule that there can be no assault liability
unless the defendant has performed some physical act. D is therefore

1224

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

an effective defense and is therefore incorrect.

38.  C  Although  extrinsic  evidence  of  unconvicted  bad  acts  is  not  usually
admissible  for  the  purpose  of  proving  that  a  person  has  a  bad
character  or  was  inclined  to  commit  other  bad  acts,  such  evidence
may be admissible for other purposes. Proof that a fact is not as stated
by the defendant may be admissible for the purpose of impeachment
(i.e., to show that his or her testimony is not to be believed). If such
proof is extrinsic (i.e., not from the defendant's own mouth) it may be
used  to  impeach,  but  only  if  it  relates  to  a  material  issue  in  the
controversy.  Since  the  defendant  claimed  to  be  1,000  miles  away
from where the crime of arson was committed, his whereabouts on the
day  of  the  crime  are  of  consequence  (i.e.,  material)  in  the  arson
prosecution.  The  witness's  testimony  is  therefore  admissible  to
impeach  the  defendant.  In  general,  evidence  is  admissible  as
substantive proof if it is relevant to some fact of consequence in the
controversy.  Since  the  defendant's  whereabouts  on  the  day  of  the
crime  are  material  to  the  arson  prosecution,  the  witness's  testimony
— which tends to establish that the defendant was in the city on the
day of the fire — is admissible as substantive evidence.

39.  C  Since  a  will  speaks  upon  the  death  of  the  testator,  the  mailman's
interest  was  created  upon  the  death  of  the  landowner.  An  executory
interest  is  a  future  interest  in  a  grantee  that  will  become  possessory
only upon the termination of a prior estate, the termination of which is
not inevitable. Since, according to the devise, the friend's interest was
to terminate only if he died without issue from his wife, and since it
was not inevitable that this would happen, it was executory. Since the
mailman's interest was to replace that of the friend, it was a shifting
interest.

Consequently, A, B, and D are incorrect.

40. D If a claim is brought in federal court based on a question of federal
law, the federal court will also have jurisdiction over any state law
claims  arising  from  the  same  case  or  controversy.  See  Hurn  v.
Oursler,  289  U.S.  238  (1933).  Because  both  the  federal  law  claim
and the breach of contract claim arise from the woman's loss of her
job,  the  federal  court  would  have  jurisdiction  over  the  breach  of
contract  claim  even  if  it  is  based  on  state  law.  Therefore,  A  is
incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  amount  in  the  controversy

1225

requirement for federal question jurisdiction. C is incorrect because
the  saleswoman  would  not  be  able  to  bring  a  claim  against  the
company if it did not arise from the same case or controversy.

41.  A  Under  FRE  609,  evidence  that  a  witness  has  been  convicted  of  a
crime is admissible for the purpose of attacking his or her credibility
under two distinct sets of circumstances. Such evidence is admissible
if the crime was a felony and the court determines that the probative
value outweighs the prejudicial effect to the defendant. Such evidence
is  also  admissible,  however,  if  the  crime  is  one  that  involved
dishonesty.  Since  tax  fraud  is  a  crime  involving  dishonesty,  the
evidence  is  admissible  whether  or  not  the  crime  was  a  felony,  and
without  an  affirmative  finding  that  its  probative  value  outweighs  its
prejudicial effect.

B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

42.  B  In  Wisconsin  v.  Yoder,  406  U.S.  205  (1972),  the  United  States
Supreme  Court  specifically  held  that  in  determining  whether  a
defendant's  conduct  is  privileged  by  First  Amendment  rights  to
freedom of religion, it was proper to consider whether the defendant's
religious beliefs were sincere.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Ordinarily,  a  state  may  prohibit  specified
activities  whenever  such  prohibition  serves  a  rational  basis.  Under
the  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment,  however,  a  state
may  not  interfere  with  acts  performed  in  the  exercise  of  religious
beliefs  unless  the  interference  bears  a  rational  relationship  to  a
compelling state interest. This means that there are some acts that the
state  may  validly  declare  to  be  criminal  and  prohibit  because  the
prohibition has a rational basis, but which may still be performed by
persons who are doing so in the exercise of their religious beliefs if
the prohibition does not bear a rational relationship to a compelling
state  interest.  Thus,  First  Amendment  rights  to  freedom  of  religion
might justify acts that would otherwise be criminal. For this reason,
C and D are both incorrect.

43. C The Equal Protection Clause provides that no state shall deny to any
person  within  its  jurisdiction  the  equal  protection  of  the  law.  This
means  that  any  state  agency  that  employs  a  system  of  classification
granting  rights  or  privileges  to  some  persons  while  denying  them  to
others  may  be  violating  rights  conferred  by  the  Equal  Protection
Clause.  Some  systems  of  classification  are  valid  if  they  have  a

1226

rational  basis;  other  systems  are  valid  only  if  they  are  necessary  to
serve a compelling state interest. It is uncertain whether the exclusion
of pregnant students from a public high school system is valid. Of the
fact situations given, however, C is the only one that could possibly
involve a violation of rights granted by the Equal Protection Clause.
This  is  because  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  regulates  only  state
action, and C is the only fact situation involving state action.

The  defendant  in  A  is  employed  by  a  religious  organization.  The
defendant  in  B  is  a  federal  official.  The  defendant  in  D  works  in
private enterprise. Since none of them is an agency of the state, A, B,
and D are incorrect.

is  defective  and  unreasonably  dangerous, 

44. A Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  professional  supplier  of  a  product
that 
that  defect
proximately causes harm to a plaintiff whose contact with the product
was foreseeable. If the reasonable person could not have anticipated
the  plaintiff's  contact  with  the  chemical  (i.e.,  the  plaintiff's  contact
with  it  was  unforeseeable),  strict  liability  cannot  be  imposed  to
benefit the plaintiff.

if 

If the plaintiff's harm was produced by an unforeseeable intervening
event,  the  product  defect  was  not  a  proximate  cause  of  it.  B  is
incorrect,  however,  because  intervening  negligence  may  be  (and
usually is) regarded as foreseeable. If the plaintiff's injury would not
have  occurred  but  for  the  crack  in  the  sewer,  the  crack  was  also  a
cause  of  harm.  The  existence  of  an  additional  cause  of  harm  is  not
sufficient  to  relieve  any  defendant  of  liability,  however,  unless  that
additional cause was unforeseeable. Since there is no indication that
the  crack  in  the  sewer  was  unforeseeable,  C  is  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  strict  products  liability  does  not  depend  on  the
existence  of  a  commercial  relationship  (i.e.,  privity)  between  the
defendant and any other person.

45. D Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c), if a party wants to amend a pleading to
change  the  party  against  whom  a  claim  is  asserted,  the  amendment
will relate back to the date of the original pleading if the claim arises
out  of  the  same  occurrence  as  the  original  pleading,  so  long  as  the
new party is served within 90 days after the complaint is filed (Fed.
R. Civ. P. 4(m)) and “(i) received such notice of the action that it will
not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and (ii) knew or should
have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for

1227

a  mistake  concerning  the  proper  party's  identity.”  The  owner  was
served on June 22, so it was within 90 days. Additionally, the man's
amended complaint arose from the same accident and the owner knew
that an action would be brought against him (based on his phone call
to the man). Therefore, B is incorrect.

A is incorrect because it states the wrong deadline for service. C is
incorrect because it is not enough that the claim arose from the same
occurrence. Importantly, the new party must have had some notice or
knew of the likelihood of being sued.

46. C An inter vivos conveyance of realty is not effective without delivery.
Delivery occurs when the grantor, by some words or act, manifests an
intent that the deed have a present operative effect. While the woman
indicated that she wanted to be sure that the husband had the property
after her death, she may have intended the quitclaim deed to transfer
an  interest  immediately.  If,  instead  of  handing  the  document  to  the
husband, she had locked it in a safe deposit box to which only she had
access,  it  would  be  clear  that  she  did  not  intend  an  immediate
transfer. On the other hand, if she simply handed it to the husband, it
would  be  clear  that  she  did  intend  an  immediate  transfer.  Here,
because  she  was  unable  to  leave  the  hospital,  she  could  not
personally place it in a safe deposit box. When she handed it to the
husband  with  the  request  that  he  put  it  in  the  box,  she  may  have
intended  to  “deliver”  it  to  him,  or,  without  intending  any  present
effect, she may have been asking him to lock it away for her since she
was  physically  unable  to  do  so  herself.  From  the  facts  given,  it  is
impossible to determine with certainty what her intention was. If the
safe  deposit  box  was  held  jointly  by  the  woman  and  the  husband,
however,  it  is  likely  that  she  intended  an  immediate  transfer,  since
putting the quitclaim deed in the box would place it in the husband's
immediate possession. C is correct since it is the only fact listed that
could possibly result in a judgment for the husband.

Since the formal requirements for wills are usually more demanding
than those for deeds, a deed that is intended to take effect only on the
death  of  a  grantor  (i.e.,  a  testamentary  substitute)  is  invalid.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  a  gift  causa  mortis  is
revoked  by  operation  of  law  if  the  donor  recovers  from  the  illness
that  threatened  his  or  her  life  at  the  time  the  gift  was  made.  D  is
requires  possession
adverse  possession 
incorrect  because 

1228

inconsistent  with  the  rights  of  the  owner,  and  the  husband's
possession of the land was at the woman's request.

47.  A  Under  the  best  evidence  rule  (aka  the  original  document  rule),
secondary  evidence  of  a  writing  is  not  admissible  to  prove  the
contents of the writing unless the original or a qualified duplicate is
shown to be unavailable. If the writing involved is in the hands of a
person  located  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court,  it  may  be
regarded as unavailable. This is not so, however, if the person who
has  it  is  the  party  offering  secondary  evidence.  Since  the  original
contract is in the hands of the plaintiff, it therefore cannot be regarded
as  unavailable.  Nevertheless,  the  copy  that  the  plaintiff  offers  in  A
will not be excluded under the best evidence rule, since the FRE treat
all photocopies as originals.

In B,  the  defendant  is  charged  with  forging  a  check.  This  obviously
places the contents of the check in issue. Since the check has not been
shown  to  be  unavailable,  the  best  evidence  rule  will  exclude  oral
testimony  as  to  its  contents.  Ordinarily,  an  expert  witness  may  base
his or her opinion on things that are not in evidence. In C, however,
the expert has based her opinion solely on her examination of the X-
ray. In effect, this means that all she is really doing is telling the court
what the X-ray says. By doing so, she placed the contents of the X-
ray  in  issue.  Under  the  best  evidence  rule,  her  testimony  is  thus
inadmissible unless the X-ray is produced or its absence explained. If
the writing in question is in the control of an adverse party who has
failed  to  produce  the  original  after  receiving  notice  to  do  so,  the
document may be regarded as unavailable. In D, however, there is no
indication  that  the  state  tax  collector  was  asked  to  produce  the
plaintiff's  original  tax  return  or  refused  to  do  so.  Until  the  plaintiff
establishes  this,  or  otherwise  establishes  that  the  tax  return  is
unavailable,  the  best  evidence  rule  will  prevent  the  admission  of
secondary evidence of its contents.

48. D Under 28 U.S.C. §1391, venue is proper in “(1) a judicial district in
which  any  defendant  resides,  if  all  defendants  are  residents  of  the
State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a
substantial  part  of  the  events  or  omissions  giving  rise  to  the  claim
occurred,  or  a  substantial  part  of  property  that  is  the  subject  of  the
action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may
be otherwise brought as provided in this section, any judicial district

1229

in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction
with  respect  to  such  action.”  Because  both  the  doctor  and  the  nurse
are  citizens  of  State  C,  either  of  the  districts  in  State  C  are  proper.
Additionally,  since  the  accident  occurred  in  the  Eastern  District  of
State B, that is also a proper venue.

Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.

49. B Embezzlement is criminal conversion of personal property known to
be  another's  with  intent  to  defraud,  committed  by  one  in  lawful
possession  of  that  property.  (Note:  Some  jurisdictions  require  that
there be a fiduciary relationship between victim and defendant. Since
the defendant's possession of the wallet resulted from her employment
relationship with the attorney, she may be found to have possessed it
as  his  fiduciary.)  When  the  defendant  spent  some  of  the  attorney's
money on ice cream, she converted it. Since she planned to keep the
money (i.e.,  use  it  as  her  own)  she  had  the  intent  to  defraud.  At  the
time,  she  was  in  lawful  possession  of  the  wallet.  Her  use  of  the
attorney's  money  for  the  purchase  of  ice  cream  was,  therefore,  an
embezzlement.  Once  a  crime  has  been  committed,  it  cannot  be
uncommitted. Thus, her returning the money to the attorney would not
prevent her from being convicted.

C is therefore incorrect. Larceny is a trespassory taking and carrying
off  of  personal  property  known  to  be  another's  with  the  intent  to
permanently deprive. A taking is trespassory if it violates the rights of
the  owner.  When  the  defendant  found  the  attorney's  wallet  in  the
parking lot and carried it off, she did not commit a trespassory taking
since her purpose prevented the taking from violating the rights of the
attorney.  For  this  reason,  and  because  she  then  lacked  the  intent  to
permanently  deprive  the  attorney,  she  did  not  commit  larceny  by
taking  the  wallet  home.  When  she  formed  the  intent  to  permanently
deprive  the  attorney,  and  when  she  acted  on  that  intent  by  spending
some of the money, the wallet was already in her possession, so she
did  not  “take”  or  carry  it  off.  For  this  reason,  she  did  not  commit
larceny. A and D are therefore incorrect.

50. C Private nuisance involves liability-forming conduct by the defendant
that unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy
his or her realty. A defendant's conduct may be liability-forming if it
involves  an  intentional  invasion  of  the  plaintiff's  rights.  A  defendant
“intends”  a  particular  result  if  he  or  she  acts  with  the  desire  or

1230

substantial  certainty  that  it  will  occur.  Here,  as  a  result  of  his
conversation  with  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant  knew  with  substantial
certainty  that  his  conduct  was  interfering  with  the  plaintiff's  use  and
enjoyment of his realty — and, therefore, by definition he intended the
interference.  Thus,  if  the  interference  was  an  unreasonable  one,  the
defendant  is  liable  for  nuisance.  Although  the  (un)reasonableness  of
the  invasion  depends  on  many  factors  not  given,  private  nuisance  is
the only theory listed that could possibly result in a judgment for the
plaintiff.

Trespass  to  land  requires  an  intentional  unauthorized  entry  onto  the
plaintiff's  realty  by  something  tangible.  Since  there  was  no  tangible
entry onto the plaintiff's land, A is incorrect. Intentional infliction of
emotional  distress  requires  outrageous  conduct  by  which  the
defendant  intentionally  inflicts  severe  mental  suffering  upon  the
plaintiff. B  is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff  does  not  seek  damages
for  mental  suffering  but  for  reduction  in  the  value  of  his  realty.
Although  an  invasion  of  privacy  may  be  committed  by  intentionally
and offensively interfering with the plaintiff's solitude, D is incorrect
because  this  theory  requires  some  physical  intrusion  into  the
plaintiff's presence.

51. B The  requirement  of  standing  exists  to  assure  that  a  person  making  a
constitutional  challenge  will  have  incentive  to  fully  and  vigorously
litigate  the  issues.  For  this  reason,  standing  requires  that  a  person
challenging  the  constitutionality  of  a  statute  show  some  actual  or
immediately threatened concrete personal injury that will be avoided
if the court grants the relief requested. Since the tax will reduce their
profits,  the  stockholders  of  a  corporation  with  sales  in  the  state  in
excess  of  $1  million  will  suffer  an  actual  injury  under  the  statute.
Since a finding that it violates the Commerce Clause would result in a
declaration that the statute is invalid and will therefore prevent the tax
from being collected, the injury will be avoided if the court grants the
relief  requested.  These  stockholders  therefore  have  standing  to
challenge the statute.

A is incorrect because there is no fact indicating that the people of the
neighboring  state  face  any  injury  under  the  statute,  and  additionally
because a state government does not have standing as a representative
of its residents. Since the corporation in C does not have annual gross
sales in excess of $1 million within the state, the statute imposes no

1231

tax on it. Thus, the corporation's stockholders lack standing because
they face no actual or immediately threatened injury under the statute.
C  is  therefore  incorrect.  Some  cases  have  held  that  state  taxpayers
have  standing  to  challenge  certain  expenditures  of  state  funds.  D  is
incorrect,  however,  because  this  statute  provides  for  acquisition
rather than expenditure of state funds.

its 

language  specifies  otherwise.  Since 

52.  A  A  transfer  of  realty  to  co-owners  is  presumed  to  convey  equal
interests  unless 
the
landowner's  will  made  the  niece  and  the  husband  joint  tenants  with
full right of survivorship as to a one-half interest, each is presumed to
have  received  an  equal  interest  in  the  one-half  interest,  or  a  one-
quarter interest in the whole. Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership
best  known  for  the  right  of  survivorship.  This  means  that  upon  the
death of a joint tenant, his or her interest passes to the surviving joint
tenant. Since a one-half interest was held by the niece and the husband
as  joint  tenants  with  full  right  of  survivorship,  the  death  of  either
spouse  would  cause  his  or  her  one-quarter  interest  in  the  realty  to
pass to the surviving spouse. Since neither spouse survived the other,
however, the interest of each passes to his or her heirs. A conveyance
to  co-owners  that  does  not  specify  the  form  of  co-ownership  is
presumed to create a tenancy in common. Since the landowner's will
did not specify the form of the daughter's co-ownership, it made her a
tenant in common with the niece and the husband. Co-owners do not
have a right to survive to the interest of a tenant in common. For this
reason, the daughter's one-half interest passes to her heirs.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  daughter's  tenancy  in  common  with  the
niece  and  the  husband  gave  her  no  right  to  their  interest.  C  is
incorrect because the landowner's will did not make the shares of the
co-owners  equal  but  specified  that  the  daughter  held  a  one-half
interest, and that the other one-half interest was held by the niece and
the  husband.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  landowner's  will  gave  the
daughter a one-half interest.

53. D The  covenant  of  quiet  enjoyment  is  a  promise  that  the  grantee  shall
peaceably  and  quietly  enjoy  possession  without  interference  by  the
grantor or anyone with a lawful claim. This covenant is breached only
when an actual eviction or other interference with possession occurs.
For this reason, it flows from the covenantor to the grantee and his or
her  successors.  Since  the  friend  interfered  with  the  baker's

1232

possession under a lawful claim of right, the warranty was breached.
Since  it  flowed  from  the  landowner  to  successors  of  the  artist,  the
landowner may be liable to the baker for damages resulting from the
breach.

The  covenant  of  seisin  is  a  promise  that  the  grantor  has  title  to  and
possession  of  the  realty.  The  covenant  against  encumbrances  is  a
promise  that  no  other  person  has  encumbrances  or  liens  against  the
realty. If the realty is not as covenanted, these covenants are breached
the  moment  a  deed  containing  them  is  delivered  to  a  grantee.  Since
the covenants are breached upon delivery of the deed, however, they
do  not  flow  to  successors  of  the  covenantor's  grantee.  Since  the
landowner did not have a right to possession (i.e., he had leased the
realty  to  a  friend),  and  since  the  friend  held  a  lien  on  the  realty
(resulting  from  the  lease),  these  covenants  were  breached  by  the
landowner when he conveyed the realty to the artist in March. Since
they do not flow to the artist's successors, however, the baker could
not  succeed  against  the  landowner  on  these  theories.  A  and  B  are
therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because a covenant of the right to
convey  does  not  include  a  promise  that  the  grantor  is  entitled  to
possession, and this covenant was not breached by the landowner at
any time.

54. D Negligence  is  the  breach  of  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  owed  to  the
plaintiff  by  the  defendant.  Ordinarily,  a  defendant  owes  a  plaintiff  a
duty  of  reasonable  care  if  the  defendant's  conduct  creates  a
foreseeable  risk  to  the  plaintiff.  Most  jurisdictions  limit  this  duty  if
the  plaintiff  is  a  trespasser  on  the  defendant's  land.  Since  the
plaintiff's  parents  had  paid  a  fee  for  her  to  stay  at  the  defendant's
camp, however, she was an invitee to whom a duty of reasonable care
was owed. Since the defendant set aside a particular area for use by
children  as  a  playing  field,  she  owed  the  children  who  used  it  (i.e.,
her  invitees)  the  duty  of  making  reasonable  inspections  and  taking
reasonable steps to protect the children against dangerous conditions.
Thus,  because  the  reasonable  person  would  have  discovered  and
removed the tree root, the defendant's failure to do so was negligent
(i.e., unreasonable).

Many  jurisdictions  have  held  that  a  landholder  is  not  obligated  to
protect  even  invitees  against  dangers  that  result  solely  from  natural
conditions of the land. Since the way softball is played and the nature
of children make it foreseeable that children using the field would run

1233

into the bushes, however, the defendant's designation of the field as a
playing field for children resulted in a risk greater than that created
by  nature  (i.e.,  the  tree  root's  existence).  Her  creation  of  this  risk
imposed  upon  her  a  duty  to  act  reasonably  to  protect  the  children
against it. A is therefore incorrect. A plaintiff assumes the risk when
he or she voluntarily encounters a danger of which he or she actually
(i.e., subjectively) knows. Since the pile of leaves covering the tree
root prevented the plaintiff from knowing about it, she did not assume
the  risk  by  encountering  it.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Some  writers
have said that an invitee is owed “the highest duty of care.” This is a
much-misunderstood  statement,  however.  All  it  really  means  is  that
the  duty  owed  to  invitees  is  generally  higher  than  that  owed  to
trespassers or licensees. Basically, it is a duty of reasonable care, not
an  absolute  duty  to  keep  invitees  safe.  It  simply  makes  landholders
liable if they fail to act reasonably. C is therefore incorrect.

55.  D  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration 
is  a  bargained-for  exchange  of
something of value for the promise. Because parties should be free to
strike whatever bargains appeal to them, courts do not usually inquire
into the relative values of the promise and the thing given in return for
it.  For  this  reason,  the  payment  of  $1  could  be  consideration  for  a
promise to hold open an offer to sell realty for $80,000. This is true,
however,  only  if  the  payment  of  $1  was  bargained-for  and  given  in
exchange for that promise. Since the seller did not ask for or receive
anything  in  exchange  for  her  promise,  it  was  unsupported  by
consideration  and  therefore  unenforceable.  In  a  few  jurisdictions,  a
recital like the seller's might be held to create a promise to pay $1,
and  that  promise  might  be  held  to  be  consideration  for  the  seller's
agreement  to  keep  the  offer  open.  D  is  correct,  however,  because  it
contains  the  only  reason  listed  that  could  possibly  support  the
conclusion that accompanies it.

The  parol  evidence  rule  prevents  the  use  of  extrinsic  evidence  of
prior  negotiations  or  agreements  to  modify  the  terms  of  an
unambiguous written contract that the parties intended as a complete
record  of  their  agreement.  Since  the  written  statement  that  she  had
received $1 was not a term of agreement but merely a recital of fact,
the parol evidence rule does not prevent the use of extrinsic evidence
to contradict it. A is therefore incorrect. When a promisee justifiably
relies  to  his  or  her  detriment  on  a  promise,  his  or  her  detrimental

1234

reliance may make the promise enforceable without consideration. B
is  incorrect,  however,  because  there  are  no  facts  indicating  that  the
buyer  changed  his  position  as  a  result  of  the  seller's  promise  (i.e.,
relied on the promise), the reasonable person would have relied on it
(i.e.,  that  reliance  was  justified),  or  the  buyer  was  damaged  (i.e.,
suffered detriment) as a result of such reliance. C is incorrect for two
reasons:  First,  courts  do  not  ordinarily  consider  whether
consideration  was  equal  in  value  to  a  promise  that  it  purports  to
support,  and  second,  the  dollar  was  not  consideration  for  the  realty
itself, but for an option to buy it.

56. C A party can only require another party to undergo a physical or mental
examination by obtaining a court order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 35(a). An
order to submit to a physical or mental examination may only be made
if the other party's physical condition is “in controversy” and there is
a showing of “good cause.”

Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

57. A Under FRE 803(2), a statement is admissible as an excited utterance
if it was made about a startling event while the declarant was under
the  stress  of  excitement  caused  by  that  event.  Since  being  pushed
down and injured is a startling event, and since the plaintiff's bleeding
and crying indicate that she was under the stress of excitement that it
produced, her statement qualifies as an excited utterance.

The  fact  that  a  declarant  is  presently  unavailable  is  never  in  itself
sufficient  to  permit  the  admission  of  his  or  her  out-of-court
statements.  B  is  incorrect  for  this  reason,  and  because  the  excited
utterance exception does not require that the declarant be unavailable.
C is incorrect, because although the plaintiff's statement is hearsay, it
is  admissible  under  the  excited  utterance  exception  to  the  hearsay
rule.  The  court  found  that  the  plaintiff  was  incompetent  to  testify
because  she  could  not  appreciate  her  duty  to  testify  truthfully.  The
reason that hearsay is customarily excluded is the fact that the hearsay
declarant was under no duty to speak truthfully when making the out-
of-court  statement.  The  excited  utterance  exception  to  the  hearsay
rule,  however,  is  based  on  the  inherent  trustworthiness  of  certain
statements made even while the declarant was under no legal duty to
tell the truth. For this reason, the plaintiff's inability to appreciate her
duty to tell the truth does not prevent her excited utterance from being
inherently trustworthy. D is therefore incorrect.

1235

58. A Leading questions are those that would give the ordinary person the
impression that the questioner desires one answer rather than another
and are ordinarily improper if asked on direct examination. FRE 611
recognizes  an  exception  to  this  rule,  permitting  leading  questions  to
be  asked  in  direct  examination  of  a  witness  associated  with  an
adverse  party.  Since  the  witness  is  employed  by  the  plaintiff's
adversary, the defendant, the objection should be overruled.

Leading  questions  may  also  be  asked  of  hostile  witnesses.  B  is
incorrect,  however,  because  a  hostile  witness  is  one  who  has
manifested  hostility  or  prejudice  under  examination,  and  there  is  no
indication  that  the  witness  did  so.  While  leading  questions  are
permitted on cross-examination, C is incorrect because the question
was  asked  on  direct  examination.  (Note:  The  facts  indicate  that  the
witness  was  called  by  the  plaintiff's  attorney  to  testify  on  the
presentation of the plaintiff's direct case.) Since the question made it
clear  that  the  examiner  wanted  an  affirmative  answer,  it  was  a
leading question. Thus, D is incorrect.

59.  D  One  who  engages  in  an  abnormally  dangerous  activity  is  strictly
liable for harm that proximately results from the dangerous nature of
that activity. Most jurisdictions hold that transporting large quantities
of any explosive substance is such an activity.

If  a  statute  is  designed  to  protect  a  class  of  persons  to  which  the
plaintiff  belongs  against  risks  like  the  one  that  resulted  in  harm,  its
violation may raise an inference or a presumption of negligence and
may  even  be  termed  negligence  per  se.  Since  the  statute  prohibited
parking  without  regard  to  a  vehicle's  contents,  it  was  obviously  not
designed  to  protect  against  risks  resulting  from  the  explosion  of  a
large quantity of gasoline. A and B are therefore incorrect. Since the
“No Parking” sign was also not designed to protect against this risk,
its violation is not relevant to determining whether the defendant was
negligent. For this reason, C is also incorrect.

60.  B  The  state  statute  could  result  in  depriving  the  girl's  parents  of  the
liberty  to  decide  what  treatment  their  daughter  should  receive.  The
Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require
that a law that regulates a liberty interest must be clear enough to be
understandable by the person of ordinary intelligence. Otherwise, the
law may be void for vagueness. The statutory use of the phrase “life-
threatening” could violate this requirement, since the meaning of that

1236

phrase may depend on the opinion of the person using it. The statutory
reference  to  “hospital  officials”  may  also  be  vague  since  it  is
impossible to tell which officials the statute designates. Although the
court might find that the statute is not vague, the argument set forth in
B  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  the  conclusion
that it is unconstitutional.

The  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits  invidious  discrimination  by
the states. A is incorrect because there is no indication that the statute
discriminates against any particular group. The Free Exercise Clause
prohibits  the  government  from  interfering  with  the  exercise  of
religious  beliefs.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  girl's  parents  have  not
claimed  that  their  refusal  to  consent  to  the  blood  transfusion  was
related  to  any  religious  belief  that  they  held.  (Note:  Beware  of
reading into a question facts that the examiners did not write into it.)
Determining  whether  a  statute  does  or  does  not  interfere  with  a
fundamental  right  is  relevant  in  selecting  the  standard  that  it  must
meet  to  be  valid.  D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  fact  that  a
statute interferes with a fundamental right is never in itself sufficient
to justify the conclusion that it is unconstitutional.

61.  B  Statements  by  a  now-unavailable  declarant  concerning  —  among
other things — the declarant's marriage, or relationship by blood or
marriage,  are  admissible  under  the  FRE  hearsay  exception  for
statements of personal history, and under the common law exception
for statements of pedigree. Since the mother was deceased at the time
of  trial,  she  was  unavailable.  Since  the  notations  contained  in  the
Bible were statements by the mother about her marriage to the man's
brother, about her relationship by marriage to the man, and about her
relationship  by  blood  to  the  niece,  it  qualifies  for  admission  under
both FRE 803(13) and the common law.

The  FRE  permit  the  admission,  as  an  “ancient  document,”  of  a
properly authenticated writing that is at least 20 years old. Common
law  usually  requires  30  years.  A  is  incorrect  under  both  systems,
however,  because  there  is  no  fact  indicating  the  age  of  the  mother's
notation in the Bible. In some jurisdictions, a law known as the “dead
man's  statute”  prevents  the  admission  of  certain  evidence  regarding
certain transactions with a person who is now deceased. Although the
dead  man's  statute  may  prevent  the  admission  of  evidence,  it  never
justifies  the  admission  of  evidence.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  Under

1237

FRE 803(9), “records of vital statistics,” including birth, death, and
marriage,  may  be  admissible  if  such  records  were  kept  by  a  public
office pursuant to the requirements of law. D is incorrect because the
notation  that  the  niece  offered  into  evidence  was  not  reported  to  or
kept by a public office pursuant to the requirements of law.

62. D Criminal conspiracy consists of an agreement between two or more
persons to commit a crime. When the defendant and the friend agreed
to  rob  a  bank,  the  crime  of  conspiracy  was  complete  —  whether  or
not they ever actually went through with the plan.

In  most  jurisdictions,  once  a  defendant  has  become  guilty  of  a
conspiracy (by agreeing to commit a crime), he or she cannot avoid
criminal  responsibility  for  the  crime  of  conspiracy  by  withdrawing
from or renouncing their plan. A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

63. C A defendant is liable for harm that proximately results from his or her
breach of a duty of reasonable care. Since a hotel keeper obviously
owes a duty of reasonable care to hotel guests, the defendant's failure
to  use  adequate  care  in  hiring  the  electrician  would  be  a  breach  of
that  duty,  making  the  defendant  liable  for  injuries  resulting  from  the
electrician's error.

Although  one  who  employs  an  independent  contractor  is  not
vicariously liable for torts committed by the contractor, the employer
may be liable for his or her own negligence in failing to use adequate
care in selecting the contractor. A is therefore incorrect. If reasonable
inspection  by  the  defendant  would  have  failed  to  disclose  the
electrician's  error,  then  the  defendant's  failure  to  discover  the
electrician's error would not be negligence. This alone would not be
enough to result in a judgment for the defendant, however, because the
defendant  may  have  committed  some  other  act  of  negligence  (e.g.,
failing  to  use  adequate  care  in  selecting  the  electrician)  for  which
liability can be imposed. B is therefore incorrect. Strict liability may
be imposed upon one who engages in (or employs another to engage
in)  an  ultra-hazardous  activity.  Strict  liability  does  not  apply,
however,  to  an  ordinary  activity  that  has  become  ultra-hazardous
because of a negligent error made by the person engaging in it. D is
therefore incorrect.

64. B A quitclaim deed conveys the interest held by the grantor at the time of
its execution. The wife could not own the entire Smith and Baker tract

1238

if  the  landowner  had  already  conveyed  part  of  it  to  the  sister.
Although  certain  methods  of  describing  realty  are  popular  or
traditional,  any  description  is  adequate  if  it  identifies  the  land
conveyed  with  reasonable  clarity.  Thus,  if  the  description  contained
in  the  landowner's  deed  to  the  sister  was  reasonably  sufficient  to
identify the property conveyed, it effectively conveyed that property.

A  conveyance  by  deed  usually  implies  a  warranty  of  title  which,  if
breached, may give the grantee a right of action against the grantor. A
quitclaim deed does not. But although one who receives a quitclaim
deed has no right of action for breach of warranty against the grantor,
the  quitclaim  deed  may  effectively  convey  whatever  interest  the
grantor  did  possess.  Thus,  if  the  landowner's  deed  to  the  sister  did
not  effectively  convey  part  of  the  Smith  and  Baker  tract,  his
conveyance  to  his  wife  by  quitclaim  could  have  been  sufficient  to
make her the owner of the entire Smith and Baker tract. A is therefore
incorrect. C and D are incorrect because a description is sufficient if
it identifies the realty conveyed with reasonable clarity.

65. B The United States Supreme Court has held that a public person suing
for defamation must prove “actual malice,” and that a private person
suing  a  media  defendant  for  defamation  must  prove  either  “actual
malice” or negligence. A defendant had “actual malice” if, at the time
he or she made a defamatory statement, he or she knew the statement
to be false or entertained serious doubts about its truth. A defendant
was negligent if at the time he or she made a defamatory statement, he
or  she  did  not  know  that  the  statement  was  false,  but  would  have
known  had  he  or  she  been  acting  reasonably.  If  officials  of  the
newspaper  believed  the  statement  was  true,  they  lacked  “actual
malice.”  If  their  belief  was  reasonable,  they  were  not  acting
negligently.  Thus,  if  they  had  a  reasonable  belief  in  the  truth  of  the
statement, the newspaper would not be liable for defamation.

Although some states recognize a privilege to publish false statements
that are contained in public records, there is no privilege to misstate
the contents of a public record. A is therefore incorrect. A defendant
who defamed a public figure may be liable if he or she had “actual
malice”  as  defined  above.  Thus,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  was  a
public  figure  would  not  be  sufficient  in  itself  to  protect  the
newspaper  against  liability  for  defaming  him.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.  A  plaintiff  asserting  a  claim  for  written  defamation  (i.e.,

1239

libel)  is  not  required  to  prove  damage  to  make  out  a  case  if  the
written  statement  was  defamatory  on  its  face.  Thus,  the  plaintiff's
failure to prove damage is not sufficient to prevent recovery. For this
reason, D is incorrect.

66.  C  The  Fourth  Amendment  guarantee  against  unreasonable  search  and
seizure  is  ordinarily  violated  when  a  search  is  conducted  without  a
warrant.  To  enforce  this  guarantee,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court
has ruled that the fruits of an unlawful search should be excluded from
evidence. A search occurs when there has been an invasion of an area
as  to  which  a  defendant  had  a  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy.
Since  the  defendant  was  the  only  person  who  had  a  key  to  the
footlocker, it was reasonable for him to expect that its contents would
remain  private.  For  this  reason,  the  officers'  first  look  into  the
footlocker  was  a  search.  Since  the  warrant  was  issued  because  of
what the officers found, its issuance was one of the fruits of that first
unlawful  search.  For  this  reason,  the  defendant's  motion  to  suppress
the  cocaine  must  be  granted.  (Note:  There  are  some  special
exceptions to the rule that a warrantless search is unlawful. The facts
in this case do not satisfy the requirements of any of these exceptions,
but  the  nature  of  the  question  only  makes  it  necessary  to  eliminate
those listed in the options.)

Consent by a third party to search the property of a defendant makes a
warrantless search lawful, but only if the person who consented had
rights in the property that were equal to those of the defendant. Since
the defendant was the only person who had a key to the footlocker, the
woman  did  not  have  rights  to  its  contents  that  were  equal  to  the
defendant's.  Thus,  her  consent  did  not  eliminate  the  need  for  a
warrant to search it. A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Even  the  consent  of  a
person who does not have an equal right to the premises might justify
a warrantless search if the police officers reasonably believed that he
or  she  had  such  a  right  (i.e.,  the  person  who  consented  had  the
“apparent authority” to do so). B is incorrect, however, because even
if  the  woman  had  apparent  authority  to  consent  to  a  search  of  the
room,  the  fact  that  the  defendant  had  the  only  key  to  the  footlocker
should have made it obvious to the officers that the woman's authority
did  not  extend  to  its  contents.  Probable  cause  justifies  an  arrest
without  a  warrant  but  does  not  justify  a  search  without  a  warrant.
Thus,  probable  cause  could  not  justify  the  first  search.  Although  a
search warrant may be issued upon a showing of probable cause, it is

1240

invalid  if  that  probable  cause  was  itself  the  fruit  of  an  unlawful
search.  Thus,  probable  cause  does  not  justify  the  issuance  of  the
warrant or the second search that was conducted pursuant to it. D is
therefore incorrect.

67.  A  Although  a  breach  of  contract  may  entitle  the  wronged  party  to
suspend his or her own performance, it does not always give him or
her the right to terminate the contract entirely. Fairness and the courts
ordinarily  require  that  the  breaching  party  be  allowed  a  reasonable
period of time in which to cure the breach. If it is cured within that
period, the breaching party may enforce the contract against the non-
breaching  party,  although  he  or  she  may  be  liable  for  damages
resulting  from  his  or  her  breach.  In  determining  whether  the  breach
was cured in a reasonable time, the courts consider the nature of the
contract  itself  and  the  circumstances  surrounding  its  formation.
Because  the  circumstances  contemplated  by  the  parties  made  it
essential that the conveyance occur on or before June 15, the court is
likely  to  determine  that  a  conveyance  on  June  16  did  not  cure  the
breach.

Sometimes  the  phrase  “time  is  of  the  essence”  is  inserted  in  a
contract  to  make  it  clear  that  the  circumstances  contemplated  by  the
parties did make it essential that performance occur by a certain date.
Since  those  circumstances  may  be  found  to  exist  even  without  the
insertion  of  specific  language,  however,  its  insertion  is  not  the  only
thing  that  would  result  in  a  judgment  for  the  buyer.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. Even if the seller's breach resulted in damage to the buyer,
a court could find that the breach was cured within a reasonable time,
and that therefore the buyer's only remedy is damages. C is therefore
incorrect. D  is  incorrect  because  contract  liability  does  not  depend
on fault and may be imposed in spite of reasonable efforts to comply
with the contract.

68.  D  One  who  engages  in  an  ultra-hazardous  or  abnormally  dangerous
activity  is  strictly  liable  for  damage  that  proximately  results
therefrom. Since most jurisdictions agree that storing poisonous gases
is an ultra-hazardous or abnormally dangerous activity, proof that the
gas is extremely deadly would be sufficient to result in the imposition
of strict liability on the defendant.

One who places a defective product — whether defective in design
or in manufacture — in the stream of commerce may be held strictly

1241

liable  for  damage  resulting  from  the  product  defect.  A  is  incorrect,
however, because the defendant did not place the tank in the stream of
commerce. B and C are incorrect because the defendant did not place
the gas that injured the plaintiff in the stream of commerce.

69. A Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(b), the party using an expert witness
must automatically supply a written report containing “(i) a complete
statement  of  all  opinions  the  witness  will  express  and  the  basis  and
reasons  for  them;  (ii)  the  facts  or  data  considered  by  the  witness  in
forming them; [and] (iii) any exhibits that will be used to summarize
or support them.” Consequently, the airline's attorney does not need to
do anything to know the details of the expert's research before trial.

Therefore, B, C, and D are incorrect.

70. A Lay witnesses are generally permitted to testify only to facts. When it
would be helpful to a clear understanding of the witness's testimony,
however,  the  opinion  of  a  lay  witness  may  be  admissible  if  it  is
rationally based on the perceptions of the witness. The decision as to
whether this is so and as to whether the lay opinion is admissible is
made in the court's discretion. Therefore, if the judge decides that the
witness's  opinion  is  rationally  based  on  her  perceptions,  it  is
admissible.  Conversely,  unless  the  judge  so  decides,  the  witness's
opinion should be excluded.

So long as they do not go beyond matters in common knowledge, lay
opinions  about  the  physical  and  mental  condition  of  another  are
usually  admissible.  For  this  reason,  an  opinion  that  another  person
was intoxicated is admissible (so long as it is rationally based on the
witness's  perceptions)  even  if  the  witness  is  not  an  expert  on
intoxication.  B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  The  admissibility  of
opinion evidence is a question of law for the judge. This means that
the  judge  cannot  admit  the  witness's  opinion  testimony  unless  he  or
she finds it to be rationally based on the witness's perceptions, and he
or  she  cannot  delegate  that  responsibility  to  the  jury.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

71. C The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits
a  state  from  denying  persons  within  its  jurisdiction  the  equal
protection of the law. A system of classification contained in social or
economic  legislation  is  usually  presumed  to  comply  with  this
requirement  so  long  as  it  has  some  rational  basis.  When  the

1242

classification is a “suspect” one, the presumption of constitutionality
is inverted, and the statute is unconstitutional unless it is necessary to
serve  a  compelling  state  interest.  Since  alienage  is  a  “suspect
classification,” a statute that discriminates against aliens is ordinarily
required  to  meet  the  compelling  state  interest  test.  Under  the
“political function” exception, however, a statute that prevents aliens
from holding a particular state job may be constitutionally valid if the
job is one that should be performed only by people familiar with and
sympathetic to American traditions. The Supreme Court has held that
the only jobs falling into this category are those that invest the public
employee with the power to make policy or with broad discretion in
executing public policy.

A is incorrect because not all “traditional” government activities fall
into  this  category.  Since  alienage  is  a  suspect  classification,  B  is
incorrect  because  a  rational  basis  is  not  sufficient  to  justify  a
classification  based  on  alienage.  Statutes 
interfere  with
fundamental interests — like those based on “suspect classifications”
—  are  also  subject  to  the  compelling  state  interest  standard.  D  is
incorrect,  however,  because  a  classification  based  on  alienage  is
“suspect,”  making  the  compelling  state  interest  standard  applicable
even if the right with which the statute interferes is not a fundamental
one.

that 

72.  D  Unless  the  parties  stipulate  otherwise,  a  jury  verdict  must  be

unanimous. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 48(b).

A and B are incorrect because the jury must have between 6 and 12
members. C is  incorrect  because  the  Seventh  Amendment  generally
does  not  give  a  right  to  a  jury  trial  for  parties  seeking  an  equitable
claim such as an injunction.

73. C Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over claims that arise
under federal law. See 28 U.S.C. §1331. Since the woman is making a
claim based on the federal National Labor Relations Act, the federal
district court in State A has jurisdiction over the matter.

Because the woman is bringing a federal claim, any issues regarding
the  citizenship  of  the  parties  are  irrelevant.  Therefore,  A, B,  and  D
are incorrect.

74. B Negligence  is  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  This  duty  is
breached  by  a  defendant's  failure  to  act  like  the  reasonable  person.

1243

Thus, unless the reasonable person would have repaired the fence, the
defendant's failure to do so was not negligent.

In  most  jurisdictions,  a  person  who  keeps  a  wild  animal  is  strictly
liable  for  damage  that  it  causes.  The  jurisdictions  that  do  not  apply
this  rule  generally  hold  that  keeping  a  wild  animal  is  prima  facie
negligent.  Neither  rule  is  applied,  however,  unless  the  injury
sustained by the plaintiff resulted from the wild and dangerous nature
of  the  animal  involved.  Since  even  a  domestic  animal  might  knock
over a fence that has become badly deteriorated, the plaintiff's injury
did not result from the wild and dangerous nature of the defendant's
cougar.  For  this  reason,  A  is  incorrect.  In  deciding  whether  a
defendant's  conduct  was  negligent,  it  is  compared  to  that  of  the
reasonable  person.  What  matters  is  not  what  the  defendant  actually
knew  about  the  risks,  but  what  the  reasonable  person  in  the
defendant's  position  would  have  known  about  those  risks.  C  is
incorrect because the issue was whether a reasonable person would
repair  the  fence.  A  plaintiff  assumes  a  risk  when,  knowing  that  it
exists,  he  or  she  voluntarily  encounters  it.  D  is  incorrect  because
there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  the  plaintiff  knew  that  the  fence  was
deteriorated enough to create a risk that the cougar would injure her.

75.  B  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  unenforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration 
is  a  bargained-for  exchange  of
something  of  value  given  in  return  for  and  to  induce  a  promise.  It
usually  consists  of  some  benefit  conferred  upon  the  promisor  or  of
some  detriment  incurred  by  the  promisee.  Consistent  with  this
definition  is  the  rule  that  a  promisee's  undertaking  to  do  something
that he or she is already legally obligated to do (i.e., performance of a
preexisting  duty)  is  not  consideration  for  a  new  promise  by  the
promisor because it does not confer on the promisor any benefit that
he or she was not already entitled to receive and does not impose on
the  promisee  any  detriment  that  he  or  she  had  not  already  incurred.
Since all that the worker gave the farmer in return for his promise to
pay  for  the  tractor  rental  was  her  promise  that  she  would  finish
plowing by April 1, and since she was already legally obligated to do
so,  the  farmer  may  successfully  argue  that  his  promise  was
unsupported  by  consideration.  [Note:  Although  UCC  §2-209(1)
permits the modification of a sales contract between merchants to be
enforced  without  consideration,  it  is  inapplicable  here  because  this
was not a contract for sale.]

1244

Although the Statute of Frauds makes an oral contract for the purchase
of goods with a price of $500 or more unenforceable over objection,
A  is  incorrect  because  the  agreement  between  the  farmer  and  the
worker was not for the sale of goods. Duress is some compulsion or
restraint  that  deprives  a  contracting  party  of  the  ability  to  exercise
free will and usually involves some physical force or threat. A few
cases  have  recognized  the  possibility  of  economic  duress,  but  this
defense  is  rarely  applied,  and  when  it  is,  it  involves  much  more
desperate  economic  threats  than  any  indicated  by  the  facts  in  this
case. C is incorrect for this reason and because a party to a contract
is  expected  to  show  reasonable  firmness  in  asserting  his  or  her
contract  rights.  Since  the  farmer  failed  to  object  to  the  additional
charge, it is unlikely that a court would conclude that he did so under
duress. When a promise would ordinarily be unenforceable because
it  is  unsupported  by  consideration  or  because  it  fails  to  satisfy  the
Statute of Frauds, justified detrimental reliance by the promisee may
result  in  enforcement  on  a  theory  of  promissory  estoppel.  D  is
incorrect,  however,  because  the  farmer's  reliance  on  the  worker's
promise is not relevant to the worker's attempt to enforce the farmer's
promise.

76. C The landowner's conveyance made his son a life tenant. A life tenant
may convey that interest. When the son quitclaimed his interest in the
land,  the  wife  gained  a  life  estate  per  autre  vie,  or  a  life  estate
measured by the life of another. Here, the wife would get what the son
had, specifically a life estate measured by the son's life. The daughter
continued  to  hold  a  remainder  in  fee  simple,  since  the  conveyance
gave  “the  remainder  to  my  daughter”  without  any  limitation.
Ultimately,  the  daughter  would  get  the  land  from  the  wife  when  the
son died. The fact that the landowner did not give the son permission
to quitclaim his interest does not change the analysis.

Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

77. B False pretenses consists of obtaining title to another's property by a
knowing  false  statement  of  present  or  past  fact  with  the  intent  to
defraud.  Here,  the  dealer  obtained  title  to  the  man's  money  by
knowingly  lying  about  the  fact  the  car  was  not  a  new  car.
Consequently,  he  could  be  charged  with  this  crime,  and  D  is
incorrect.

A is incorrect because larceny by trick happens when a victim merely

1245

transfers  custody  of  his  or  her  property,  not  title.  C  is  incorrect
because embezzlement requires the person to convert property he or
she is already in lawful possession of. Here, the dealer was clearly
not already in lawful possession of the man's money before the man
gave it to him based on his belief he was buying a new car.

78.  A  Federal  courts  of  appeal  review  a  district  court's  determination
regarding  unsettled  state  law  de  novo.  Consequently,  a  court  of
appeals should not defer to a district court's decision.

B is incorrect because a federal court sitting in diversity must apply
the  substantive  law  of  the  state  in  which  it  is  sitting.  See  Erie
Railroad  v.  Tompkins,  304  U.S.  64  (1938).  C  is  incorrect  because
federal courts follow federal procedural law. D is incorrect because
statutes of limitations are substantive law when determining whether
to  apply  federal  or  state  law.  See  Guaranty  Trust  Co.  v.  York,  326
U.S.  99  (1945).  Consequently,  a  federal  court  should  follow  the
statute of limitations rules of the state in which it is sitting.

79. C Exigent circumstances justify a warrantless entry into a home if police
officers  are  assisting  an  injured  occupant  or  preventing  imminent
injury.  Exigent  circumstances  also  include  preventing  the  imminent
destruction of evidence and searching in “hot pursuit” for a suspect.
Here,  the  officer  heard  the  men  fighting,  and  entered  the  home  to
prevent  imminent  injury.  He  then  discovered  the  drug  evidence  in
plain  view.  A  is  incorrect  because  exigent  circumstances  were
present.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  plain  view  doctrine  applies  to
situations  where  police  see  evidence  of  a  crime  from  a  location
where they have a right to be. Here, the plain view doctrine does not
address  the  officer's  initial  entry  into  the  house.  D  is  incorrect
because the issue here is exigent circumstances, not probable cause.
Additionally,  the  validity  of  a  search  does  not  depend  on  whether
there was probable cause for the suspect's ultimate arrest.

80. A UCC §1-205 defines usage of trade as a practice or method of dealing
that  is  regularly  observed  in  a  particular  industry.  UCC  §2-202
permits  evidence  of  usage  of  trade  to  explain  the  terms  of  a  written
contract, even when the contract was intended to be a final expression
of the agreement of the parties.

B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Ordinarily,  parties  to  a  contract  are
understood  to  accept  the  economic  risks  resulting  from  subsequent

1246

events  that  were  within  their  contemplation  at  the  time  the  contract
was formed. This means that if the parties did contemplate a decline
in new home starts, a strong argument could be made that the builder
should  be  bound  by  the  20,000-board-feet  minimum  set  forth  in  the
contract. The fact that they did not contemplate such a decline in new
homes, if relevant at all, is thus more likely to support the builder's
position than it is to support the supplier's. In any event, although the
contemplation of the parties might help determine the meaning of the
terms that they used, it is not the only factor to be considered. In fact,
the  UCC  specifically  permits  evidence  of  trade  usage  to  be
considered as well. C is therefore incorrect. Ordinarily, in construing
contracts, courts consider the manifest intentions of the parties and do
so by examining the language of the written agreement between them.
A problem may arise, however, since the words used may have meant
different things to the different parties. Since trade usage may indicate
the  meaning  that  certain  terms  generally  have  for  people  in  the
industry  involved,  the  UCC  provision  regarding  trade  usage  is
designed to help determine what the parties meant by the terms they
used.  If,  for  example,  it  was  generally  understood  in  the  trade  that
minimum  requirements  were  inapplicable  in  times  of  falling  prices,
the parties might have specified a minimum number, meaning it to be
applicable only if prices did not fall, even though this intention would
not be apparent to persons not in the trade. The argument set forth in
D, however, is based on what the language means to people who are
unaware of its special trade usage. For this reason, D is incorrect.

81. B The United States Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment of
the  United  States  Constitution  requires  a  public  official  or  public
figure  suing  for  defamation  to  prove  that  the  defendant  had  actual
malice  in  making  the  defamatory  statement.  The  Court  defined  a
public official as a public employee who has or reasonably appears
to  have  substantial  control  over  the  conduct  of  public  affairs.  The
plaintiffs  are  clearly  public  employees.  Whether  they  reasonably
appear to have substantial control over the conduct of public affairs
may be a question of fact, but B is the only argument listed that could
possibly result in a judgment for the newspaper.

The United States Supreme Court has said that there is no such thing
as  a  false  idea.  Since  defamation  liability  cannot  be  imposed  for
publication of the truth, this statement by the Supreme Court prevents
defamation  liability  from  being  imposed  for  the  publication  of  an

1247

opinion.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  —  even  though  it  was
contained  in  an  editorial  —  the  statement  that  the  majority  of
firefighters  were  dangerously  out  of  shape  and  had  recently  failed
their physicals is obviously an assertion of fact. The Supreme Court
has  defined  a  public  figure  as  either  one  who  has  achieved  such
“pervasive  fame  and  notoriety”  that  he  or  she  is  known  to  the  great
mass of humanity, or one who has voluntarily “mounted the rostrum”
in  an  attempt  to  influence  public  opinion  on  a  matter  of  public
controversy.  C  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that
either  definition  applies  to  the  plaintiffs.  In  addition,  C  is  incorrect
because  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  a  defendant  may  not
successfully  argue  that  the  plaintiff  has  become  a  public  figure  as  a
result of the defamatory statements that the defendant published about
the  plaintiff.  D  is  incorrect  since  the  Supreme  Court's  definition  of
“public official” makes it clear that not all public employees fit into
this category.

82. B Under UCC §2-609, whenever it reasonably appears that a party to a
sales contract will be unable to perform as required, the other party
may  demand  an  adequate  assurance  of  performance.  If  the  party  on
whom  such  demand  is  made  fails  to  respond  within  a  reasonable
period  of  time,  the  party  making  that  demand  may  treat  the  other
party's  prospective  inability  to  perform  as  a  repudiation.  Since  the
destruction of the plaintiff's only factory raised reasonable questions
about whether the plaintiff would be able to perform as required, the
police department was entitled to demand assurances as it did in its
letter  of  July  10.  When  the  plaintiff  failed  to  respond  within  a
reasonable  time,  the  police  department  was  relieved  of  any  further
obligation to perform.

When unforeseen circumstances eliminate the underlying reasons for
contracting,  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose  may  excuse
performance by the parties. (If, for example, all the criminals in the
city stopped using guns so that there was no longer any reason for the
police  department  to  need  bulletproof  vests,  the  doctrine  of
frustration  of  purpose  might  relieve  it  of  its  obligation  to  continue
purchasing  vests  from  the  plaintiff.)  A  is  incorrect  because  the
underlying reasons for the agreement between the police department
and  the  plaintiff  (i.e.,  the  police  department's  need  for  bulletproof
vests)  continued  to  exist  even  though  the  plaintiff's  factory  was
destroyed. An agreement calling for a series of performances by the

1248

parties may be regarded as a single contract or as a series of separate
ones. Calling it “divisible” simply means that the court will treat it as
a  series  of  separate  contracts.  It  is  difficult  to  tell  from  the  facts
whether the contract between the defendant and the police department
is  or  is  not  “divisible.”  In  either  event,  however,  whether  it  is  a
breach of a single agreement calling for a series of performances, or
of one of the separate agreements that result from calling the contract
divisible, the defendant's failure to deliver bulletproof vests might be
a breach. Therefore, determining that the contract was divisible is not
relevant  in  determining  whether  failure  to  perform  constitutes  a
breach,  so  C  is  incorrect.  Even  before  the  time  of  performance,  a
party  may  treat  the  other  party's  repudiation  as  a  breach.  Thus,  a
repudiation by the police department might provide the plaintiff with
an  argument  in  support  of  its  position,  but  it  would  not  provide  the
police  department  with  support  for  its  position.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

83.  C  Negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct  when  one  has  a  duty  to  act
reasonably.  Importantly,  a  person  cannot  be  negligent  if  he  or  she
acted  reasonably.  Consequently,  only  unreasonable  conduct  on  the
limousine driver's part can result in a judgment against him. Here, if a
court finds it was unreasonable for the driver to swerve to avoid the
dog,  he  would  be  liable  for  negligence.  A  is  incorrect  because  the
doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is  used  in  cases  where  the  defendant's
conduct  is  unknown.  In  that  case,  it  allows  a  plaintiff  to  create  an
inference  that  the  defendant  acted  unreasonably  by  relying  on
circumstantial  evidence.  In  that  case,  the  evidence  has  to  show  that
the accident was one that would not normally have occurred without
negligence,  under  circumstances  that  eliminated  all  probabilities
other than the negligence of the defendant. Here, such circumstantial
evidence  is  unnecessary  because  the  limousine  driver's  conduct  in
swerving to avoid the dog was known. Under negligence per se, the
defendant is negligent if, without excuse, he or she violates a statute
that  is  designed  to  protect  against  the  type  of  accident  that  the
defendant's conduct causes, and the accident victim is within the class
of  persons  the  statute  is  designed  to  protect.  The  important  point  is
that  the  violation  must  cause  the  accident.  Since  the  accident  would
have happened even if the limousine driver had insurance, there is no
causal link between the violation and the statute. Thus, B is incorrect.
D  is  incorrect  because  even  if  the  limousine  driver  owed  some

1249

special  duty  to  the  teenagers,  he  still  would  have  had  to  act
unreasonably before he could be found liable.

84. C Under the statute, the defendant can be guilty of second degree murder
only if the victim dies during the course of the commission of one of
the  enumerated  felonies.  Nothing  in  the  facts  suggests  that  the
defendant or the friend was committing a rape, kidnapping, burglary,
or arson. Robbery is a larceny that is committed by force or a threat
of  force  against  a  human  being.  Larceny  is  a  trespassory  taking  and
carrying off of personal property known to be another's with the intent
to  permanently  deprive  the  other  of  it.  Since  the  jury  believed  the
defendant's testimony, the coat that she was attempting to obtain from
the victim was her own. Her taking it could not, therefore, constitute a
larceny, and her use of force to take it was not a robbery.

A and B are incorrect because if a death occurs during the course of
one  of  the  felonies  specified,  the  felony  murder  rule  is  frequently
applied  even  though  the  death  was  unforeseeable.  Since  the  statute
provides  that  an  unintentional  killing  is  second  degree  murder  if
perpetrated by the defendant or an accomplice during the course of a
listed crime, D is obviously incorrect.

85. C Since the notary received his interest from the barber, the validity of
the notary's title depends on the validity of the barber's title. For this
reason,  if  the  barber's  title  is  superior  to  that  of  the  landowner's
cousin, then so is the notary's. The validity of the barber's title (and
therefore of the notary's) depends on the recording statute. The statute
given  is  a  typical  “race-notice”  statute.  According  to  its  provisions,
the  interest  of  a  subsequent  grantee  for  value  and  without  notice  is
superior to that of a prior grantee unless the prior grantee's interest is
recorded  before  the  subsequent  grantee's  interest  is  recorded.  Thus,
since  the  landowner's  cousin's  interest  was  recorded  before  the
barber's, it was superior to the barber's (and therefore to the notary's).

A  is  incorrect  because  although  the  statute  makes  the  payment  of
value  a  condition  for  the  superiority  of  a  subsequent  grantee's
interest, it does not impose such a requirement on the prior grantee.
Since the “race” aspect of the statute makes priority depend on who
recorded first, the fact that the barber recorded before selling to the
notary  would  not  defeat  the  landowner's  cousin's  interest  since  the
barber  recorded  after  the  cousin  did.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.
Recording  is  “outside  the  chain  of  title”  if  it  could  not  have  been

1250

discovered  by  a  reasonable  title  search.  (For  example,  since  the
cousin recorded before the barber, a reasonable title search might not
have disclosed a record of the deed from the landowner to the barber.
This is because after finding a record of the landowner's grant to the
cousin,  the  searcher  would  have  expected  that  the  next  grant  of  an
interest in the property was by the cousin and would have no reason
to search for a subsequent grant by the landlord.) Most jurisdictions
hold that a recording outside the chain of title is no recording at all
since  it  does  not  give  the  reasonable  searcher  notice  of  the
transaction. D is incorrect, however, because if the barber recorded
prior  to  the  cousin,  the  recording  of  the  landowner's  grant  to  the
barber would have been within the chain of title.

86. D If the defendant is the initial aggressor, he or she may not claim self-
defense. Importantly, the defendant can be an aggressor, and lose the
right of self-defense, even if the defendant did not actually strike the
first  blow.  If  a  defendant  does  an  unlawful  act  that  intentionally
provokes the physical conflict, the defendant becomes the aggressor.
Here, the defendant provoked the robber by telling the robber that the
defendant would shoot him through the windshield if the robber tried
to  leave.  Consequently,  the  defendant  became  the  aggressor  and  lost
his claim of self-defense.

For  a  self-defense  claim,  the  harm  being  defended  against  must  be
reasonably imminent. While the danger that someone will be attacked
tomorrow  is  likely  insufficient  to  support  a  claim  of  self-defense,
courts will not make the defendant wait until the absolute last second
before he or she can defend himself or herself. Here, even though the
robber  was  still  getting  out  of  his  car,  a  court  would  likely  find  the
danger  was  reasonably  imminent.  Thus,  A  is  incorrect.  In  a  self-
defense  claim,  the  defendant  may  not  use  more  force  than  seems
reasonably necessary in the circumstances. Here, a large axe is likely
a use of deadly force. Consequently, the defendant's use of the pistol
was not more force than was necessary and B is incorrect. While the
robber  had  already  attempted  to  withdraw,  the  real  issue  is  the
defendant's provocation, so C is incorrect.

87.  A  In  Minnesota  v.  Olson,  495  U.S.  91  (1990),  the  United  States
Supreme Court held that an overnight guest has a legitimate interest in
privacy in the residence where he or she is staying. Consequently, the
police had to obtain a search warrant before they could lawfully enter

1251

the apartment because the man was staying there for a week and was
thus an overnight guest. Therefore, D is incorrect.

B is  incorrect  because  the  plain  view  exception  only  applies  when
the  police  see  evidence  from  a  place  they  are  lawfully  able  to  be.
Here, the police only saw the marijuana once they unlawfully entered
the apartment. C is  incorrect  because  even  if  the  neighbors  smelled
the marijuana, this was not an exigent circumstance or other exception
that would relieve the police from having to obtain a search warrant.

88. D One who holds a present possessory interest in real estate is entitled
to make all normal uses of the land and to keep the profits from those
uses so long as he or she does not unreasonably decrease its value to
the holders of future interests. This means, among other things, that the
holder  of  a  present  possessory  interest  in  realty  is  permitted  to  rent
the realty and to keep the rent. For this reason, the accountant has no
right to the rents. On the other hand, since the permanent removal of
minerals from the land will inevitably reduce the value of the realty,
limitations  on  the  removal  of  minerals  are  imposed  on  holders  of
certain present possessory interests. If, however, the grantor had been
actively  removing  minerals  from  the  realty,  it  is  presumed  that  in
granting a present possessory interest, the grantor intended to grant the
right to continue removing minerals as well. Since the landowner had
been  mining  the  gold  on  the  land,  it  is  presumed  that  he  intended  to
grant the friend the right to continue doing so, even though the friend's
interest in the realty was less than a fee. Thus, the accountant is not
entitled to proceeds from the mining operation, either.

For  the  combination  of  reasons  given  above,  A,  B,  and  C  are
incorrect.

89. B. A question of fact is an issue in the case that is decided by looking at
the facts in evidence. The validity of the rock singer's signature would
be a question of fact. A trial court's findings regarding a question of
fact  will  not  be  disturbed  unless  they  are  “clearly  erroneous.”  See
Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6).

A  is  incorrect  because  a  question  of  law  is  an  issue  that  must  be
decided by applying legal principles (for example, whether a police
officer had probable cause to arrest a suspect). C and D are incorrect
the
because  abuse  of  discretion  is  the  standard  applied  to 
discretionary decisions of a trial court, such as leaves to amend.

1252

90.  C  FRE  801(d)(1)(B)  specifies  that  a  prior  consistent  statement  of  a
declarant is not hearsay if the declarant has testified and is available
for cross-examination, and if the statement is offered to rebut a claim
of  recent  fabrication.  Since  the  victim  testified  that  the  defendant
raped her, and since the defendant claimed that the victim's complaint
was  fabricated  on  April  3,  evidence  that  the  victim  made  that  same
complaint  to  the  neighbor  on  March  7  tends  to  rebut  the  defendant's
claim. The neighbor's testimony is therefore admissible.

Under FRE 803(2), a statement is admissible as an excited utterance
if it was made about a startling event while the declarant was under
the stress of excitement caused by that event. Ordinarily, this requires
the  statement  to  have  been  made  either  during  the  event  or
immediately  thereafter.  Since  a  week  passed  between  the  alleged
rape and the victim's statement to the neighbor, it probably does not
qualify  as  an  excited  utterance.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Hearsay  is
defined  as  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  for  the  purpose  of
proving the truth of the matter asserted in that statement. If the victim's
out-of-court statement to the neighbor is not offered to prove the truth
of what she asserted (i.e., that the defendant raped her) but is offered
to prove that she did not fabricate her complaint after learning that the
defendant  was  married,  it  is  not  hearsay.  FRE  801(d)(1)(B)
specifically  provides  that  such  a  statement  “is  not  hearsay.”  This
means that in addition to being admissible for the purpose of rebutting
the defendant's claim of recent fabrication, the victim's statement may
be  admissible  as  substantive  evidence  as  well.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. FRE 803(1) recognizes a hearsay exception for a statement
of  the  declarant's  sense  impressions.  This  exception  applies,
however, only when the declarant's statement describing an event is
made  during  or  immediately  after  the  event.  Since  the  victim's
statement to the neighbor was made a week after the incident that it
purported to describe, D is incorrect.

91.  D  Since  the  formal  requirements  for  wills  are  more  demanding  than
those for deeds, a deed that is intended to take effect only on the death
of the grantor (i.e.,  a  testamentary  substitute)  is  invalid.  Thus,  if  the
woman  intended  for  the  quitclaim  deed  to  have  no  effect  until  after
her  death,  it  is  invalid.  Although  the  facts  make  it  impossible  to
determine  with  certainty  what  the  woman's  intention  was,  D  is  the
only  argument  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  a  judgment  for  the
nurse.

1253

A  is  incorrect  because  recording  statutes  protect  only  those  who
purchase  for  value.  Since  the  nurse  received  by  will  and  without
consideration,  the  husband's  failure  to  record  would  not  give  the
nurse  a  priority.  Although  a  quitclaim  deed  does  not  imply  any
warranties  or  covenants,  it  does  serve  to  transfer  whatever  interest
the  grantor  held  at  the  time  of  its  execution.  B  and  C  are  therefore
incorrect.

92. B Assault  is  the  intentional  causing  of  an  apprehension  of  harmful  or
offensive  contact.  Importantly,  the  doctrine  of  transferred  intent
applies  to  assault.  Under  this  doctrine,  if  the  defendant  had  the
necessary intent with respect to one person, he or she will be held to
have  committed  an  intentional  tort  against  any  other  person  who
happens to be injured. Here, the boy clearly intended to frighten the
babysitter. Thus, even though the boy intended to scare his babysitter,
the  fact  that  his  sister  was  nearby  and  was  put  in  apprehension  of
harmful  or  offensive  contact  (i.e.,  she  ducked)  was  enough  for
liability. A  is  incorrect  because  the  boy  could  also  have  been  held
liable for battery since he did in fact hit the babysitter. Importantly, a
defendant has the necessary intent for battery if he intended to cause
an  imminent  apprehension  on  the  plaintiff's  part  of  a  harmful  or
offensive  contact.  Basically,  the  intent  to  commit  an  assault  is
sufficient for battery. C is incorrect because if the defendant intends
to  frighten  the  plaintiff,  he  has  the  necessary  intent  for  assault.  D  is
incorrect because in the case of battery or assault, it is not necessary
that the defendant bear malice or hostility toward the plaintiff.

93. B It has been said that the offeror is monarch of the offer. This means, of
course,  that  the  person  who  institutes  the  contractual  process  by
making an offer is in complete control of that offer's terms and, upon
acceptance,  is  not  bound  to  any  terms  other  than  those.  Since  the
buyer's offer was to pay $100 for information “leading to purchase of
an  antique  car,”  he  is  not  required  to  pay  unless  the  information
furnished  actually  leads  to  the  purchase  of  an  antique  car.  Since  the
man's letter did not, it does not qualify the man to receive the reward.

A is incorrect because an offer to the general public that is made by
advertisement  ordinarily  is  not  revoked  until  a  withdrawal  is  given
approximately  equal  publicity.  C  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the
buyer only offered to pay for information leading to purchase, and the
man's did not.

1254

94  A  When  a  safety  statute  is  violated,  courts  will  find  an  unexcused
violation  of  that  statute  negligence  per  se.  There  are  three  main
requirements  for  application  of  negligence  per  se:  1)  the  defendant
violated  a  statute,  2)  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect  against  the
same  type  of  accident  that  occurred,  and  3)  the  accident  victim  is  a
member  of  the  class  of  persons  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect.
Here,  all  three  elements  were  satisfied  because  the  manufacturer
failed  to  provide  a  warning,  the  warning  would  have  protected
against the man's skin discoloration, and the man was a member of the
class  (a  user  of  the  cream)  that  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect.
However,  even  when  negligence  per  se  applies,  the  plaintiff  must
still  show  a  causal  link  between  the  violation  and  the  injury.  Here,
since the man admitted that no one in his household read the warnings,
there was no causal link, since the harm would have occurred even if
the warning was inside the packaging. B is incorrect because the main
issue  here  is  the  lack  of  the  warning  in  the  package,  not  the  man's
continued  use  of  the  cream.  C  is  incorrect,  because  there  was  no
causal link between the harm and the failure to provide the warning.
D is  incorrect  because  it  fails  to  take  into  account  whether  the  man
would have read or even followed the warning.

95. B A proceeding is moot when there are no contested material issues for
the  court  to  decide.  Since  the  girl  has  died,  the  state  court  can  no
longer  appoint  the  hospital  administrator  her  guardian.  Since  the
purpose  of  the  federal  proceeding  was  to  stop  the  state  proceeding,
and since the state proceeding must terminate in any event, there is no
longer  any  contested  issue  before  the  federal  court.  The  issues  have
thus  become  moot.  An  exception  to  the  mootness  rule  exists  when  a
controversy  is  capable  of  repetition  and  evading  judicial  review.
Under this exception, the federal court might decide to hear the case
even though the girl's death has made it moot. Mootness, however, is
the only argument listed that could possibly result in dismissal of the
proceeding brought by the girl's parents.

A  non-justiciable  political  controversy  is  a  case  in  which  a  federal
court is asked to interfere with the operation of a co-equal branch of
the  federal  government.  A  is  incorrect  because  the  challenge  raised
by the girl's parents is to a state law, not to an action of the federal
government.  The  Eleventh  Amendment  prohibits  federal  courts  from
hearing  certain  claims  against  state  governments.  C  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  Eleventh  Amendment  does  not  prevent  the

1255

federal  courts  from  hearing  claims  that  state  action  violates  the
United  States  Constitution.  Where  a  pending  state  court  proceeding
might  result  in  an  interpretation  of  or  a  conclusion  about  a  state
statute that would resolve a federal challenge to it, federal courts are
usually  unwilling  to  enjoin  enforcement  of  that  statute.  The  reason
given is sometimes said to be “equitable restraint.” It is not related,
however,  to  the  question  of  ripeness.  So  long  as  there  is  someone
who can actually benefit from a resolution of the issues, and so long
as the issues are fully developed and clearly defined, those issues are
ripe. Thus, although the issues in this case may no longer be “ripe,”
this is not because the highest state court has not decided, but because
there  is  no  longer  any  person  who  will  actually  benefit  from  a
resolution of the issues. D is therefore incorrect.

96. A Economic  regulation  by  the  state  is  constitutionally  valid  if  it  has  a
rational basis. The “pay-to-throw” program is an economic regulation
and therefore is subject to the rational basis standard. Obviously, any
legal requirement of payment may have the effect of discriminating in
favor  of  the  wealthy  against  the  poor.  However,  the  United  States
Supreme  Court  has  rejected  arguments  that  classifications  based  on
wealth  are  “suspect.”  Consequently,  B  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect
because  even 
interference  with  a  fundamental  right  may  be
constitutional  if  it  is  necessary  to  serve  a  compelling  state  interest.
laws  discriminate  against  somebody  (e.g.,  penal  codes
All 
discriminate  against  criminals).  Thus,  unless  a  law  has  no  rational
basis (in the case of certain kinds of regulation) or is not necessary to
serve  a  compelling  interest  of  the  state  (as  in  other  kinds  of
regulation),  the  fact  that  it  discriminates  against  a  discrete  class  of
persons is not enough to make it unconstitutional. Thus, D is incorrect.

97.  B  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  there  was
consideration  for  it  (i.e.,  something  given  in  exchange  for  and  to
induce  the  promise).  Since  the  man  had  already  rescued  the  dog
without expectation of payment, the rescue was not given in exchange
for  or  to  induce  the  dog  owner's  promise  and  is  therefore  not
consideration for it. Some cases have held, however, that a promise
to  do  that  which  the  promisor  is  morally  obligated  to  do  should  be
enforceable  even  without  consideration.  Although 
is  an
infrequently  applied  exception  to  the  requirement  of  consideration,
the argument set forth in B is the only one listed that could possibly
provide the man with effective support for his claim.

this 

1256

Since  the  man  had  already  rescued  the  dog  without  expecting
compensation, the rescue was not given in exchange for or to induce
the  dog  owner's  promise.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  In  determining
whether  to  rescind  a  contract  because  of  mutual  mistake,  fraud,
duress,  or  undue  influence,  the  court  may  attempt  to  decide  whether
its  failure  to  rescind  would  unjustly  enrich  one  of  the  parties.
Ordinarily, however, the fact that a party will be unjustly enriched by
something  is  not  in  itself  sufficient  to  result  in  the  imposition  of
contractual  duty  on  the  party.  C  is  incorrect  for  this  reason  and
because the fact that the man rescued the dog without expectation of
payment  probably  prevents  the  dog  owner's  enrichment  from  being
unjust.  Sometimes  a  promise  that  is  unsupported  by  consideration
will  be  enforced  under  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  if  the
promisee  justifiably  relied  upon  it  to  his  or  her  detriment.  D  is
incorrect, however, because while the man did rely on the promise to
his  detriment,  there  is  no  indication  the  dog  owner  should  have
foreseen such reliance.

98. D Since there is no evidence that the defendant in the question scenario
intended  to  cause  death  or  great  bodily  harm,  the  issue  in  the
defendant's  case  is  whether  a  person  who  lacks  such  intent  can  be
convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Although voluntary manslaughter
requires  such  intent,  murder  does  not.  In  D,  the  defendant  was
convicted of murder after bringing about the death of another person
without the intent to kill or inflict injury. The affirmance of her murder
conviction  established  that  the  trial  court  was  correct  in  refusing  to
charge  on  voluntary  manslaughter  where  the  defendant  lacked  the
intent to kill. Since this has a direct bearing on whether the defendant
(who  also  lacked  the  intent  to  kill)  can  be  convicted  of  voluntary
manslaughter, D is applicable to the defendant's case.

The  effect  of  A  is  to  hold  that  one  who  acts  unreasonably  may  be
guilty  of  involuntary  manslaughter.  Since  it  does  not  say  anything
about  what  it  would  take  to  justify  a  conviction  for  voluntary
manslaughter,  it  is  inapplicable  to  the  defendant's  case,  and  A  is
therefore incorrect. Since the defendant in B had the intent to kill and
the defendant in the question scenario did not, the decision in B that
the  court  should  have  charged  on  voluntary  manslaughter  is
inapplicable  to  the  defendant's  case.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Like
voluntary manslaughter, attempted murder requires the specific intent
to  cause  death  or  great  bodily  harm.  For  this  reason,  C  appears  at

1257

first glance to raise an issue similar to that raised in the defendant's
case.  Since  the  crimes  charged  in  the  two  cases  were  different,
however, C is not really applicable as a precedent in the defendant's
case.  (That  is,  a  holding  that  the  defendant  cannot  be  guilty  of
attempted murder without specific intent does not logically relate to
the  question  of  whether  a  defendant  can  be  guilty  of  voluntary
manslaughter without specific intent.) C is therefore incorrect.

99. C People have joint authority over a place when there is mutual use of
the  property  by  persons  generally  having  joint  access  or  control  for
most purposes. Here, the girlfriend stated that she shared the bedroom
with  the  defendant  “most  of  the  time.”  Consequently,  she  had  joint
authority over the bedroom and could give valid consent to search it.
A is incorrect because “most of the time” does not lessen the fact that
she appears to have joint access or control for most purposes. In fact,
“most  of  the  time”  could  mean  99.9  percent  of  the  time  because  the
girlfriend  did  not  limit  her  statement  in  any  way.  B  is  incorrect
because  she  does  not  need  to  be  the  owner  of  the  property  to  give
valid consent, as long as she actually has or is reasonably believed by
the  police  to  have  joint  authority  over  the  premises.  D  is  incorrect
because the girlfriend's statement made it clear she had joint authority
over  the  premises.  There  is  no  indication  in  the  question  that  the
police made any kind of mistake regarding her ability to consent to a
search,  so  the  police  would  not  have  to  argue  that  they  were
reasonable in their belief regarding the girlfriend's ability to consent.

100. A Contracts are sometimes subject to a condition precedent. A condition
precedent  is  any  event,  other  than  a  lapse  of  time,  that  must  occur
before  performance  under  the  contract  is  due.  Importantly,  strict
compliance with an express condition is ordinarily necessary. Here,
since  the  buyer  could  not  find  adequate  financing,  he  is  discharged
from  any  of  his  obligations  under  the  sales  contract.  B  is  incorrect
because even if the seller helped subsidize the interest payments, the
express  condition  precedent  still  failed  to  occur.  C  is  incorrect
because  the  failure  of  the  express  condition  precedent  meant  no
contract  was  formed.  Finally,  D  is  incorrect  because  there  was  no
contract until the condition was fulfilled, so the seller could not suffer
any damages under it.

ANSWERS
____________________
PRACTICE MBE — P.M. EXAM
101.  A  A  person  who  renders  a  measurable  benefit  to  another,  with  the
reasonable  expectation  of  payment  and  not  as  an  officious
intermeddler,  may  be  entitled  to  recovery  on  a  theory  of  quasi-
contract  (i.e.,  restitution  for  unjust  enrichment).  (Note:  Since  the
neighbor  did  not  request  the  plaintiff's  performance,  and  since  the
neighbor did not become aware of it until after it had occurred, it is
not at all certain that a court would find in favor of the plaintiff on this
theory. But since the question calls for the assumption that the plaintiff
would be successful in his claim, it is necessary to consider the relief
to which he would be entitled if successful.) Ordinarily, recovery on
this theory is based on the benefit received by the person from whom
payment  is  sought.  This  benefit  may  be  measured  in  terms  of  net
enrichment  or  cost  avoided.  If  these  amounts  are  unequal,  the  court
will usually award the lower of the two. In this case, the neighbor's
net enrichment is the increase in his realty's value — $2,100. The cost
avoided is what he would have had to pay another for the job (i.e., the
standard  market  price)  —  $2,750.  Since  the  net  enrichment  is  the
lesser of these two figures, the plaintiff would be entitled to receive
$2,100.

B and C are incorrect because the benefit received by the neighbor is
unrelated  to  the  plaintiff's  agreement  with  the  homeowner  or  to  the
plaintiff's cost. D  is  incorrect  because  it  exceeds  the  net  enrichment
that the neighbor received.

102.  C  Article  III  of  the  United  States  Constitution  vests  federal  judicial
power in the United States Supreme Court and in such inferior federal
courts  as  Congress  shall  establish.  In  addition,  by  specifying  what
cases they may hear, Article III establishes limits on the jurisdiction
that may be exercised by the federal courts. Although it gives federal
courts  the  power  (i.e.,  jurisdiction)  to  hear  controversies  between
citizens  of  different  states,  or  between  citizens  of  the  same  state
claiming lands under grants of different states, it does not give the

1259

federal courts any power to hear contract disputes between residents
of the same state. Since the United States Constitution is the supreme
law  of  the  land,  neither  Congress  nor  a  state  legislature  can  confer
this power on the United States district courts.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  The  Eleventh  Amendment  only
prohibits the federal courts from hearing certain claims against a state
and  is  inapplicable  because  the  plaintiff's  claim  is  not  against  the
state. D is therefore incorrect.

103. D  A  misrepresentation  is  a  false  assertion  of  material  fact  intended  to
induce  the  plaintiff's  reliance.  A  defendant  intends  to  induce  the
plaintiff's reliance if he or she knows with substantial certainty that a
class of persons to which the plaintiff belongs will rely on his or her
statement. If the reporter did not know that any person would rely on
her  statement,  she  could  not  have  intended  to  induce  any  person's
reliance. Her statement would therefore not be a misrepresentation.

In addition, misrepresentation liability cannot be imposed unless the
plaintiff  was  justified  in  relying  (i.e.,  the  reasonable  person  in  the
plaintiff's  situation  would  have  relied)  on  the  defendant's  false
statement.  Since  the  reasonable  person  might  believe  a  newspaper
account instead of personally checking public records, however, A is
incorrect. B is incorrect for two reasons: First, an expert's statement
of opinion may be a misrepresentation because it asserts as a fact that
the  expert  actually  holds  that  opinion,  and  second,  the  reporter's
statement that “Insiders say . . . (etc.)” is an assertion of fact on which
misrepresentation  liability  could  be  based.  In  actions  for  negligent
misrepresentation,  it  is  frequently  held  that,  without  privity,  the
defendant owes the plaintiff no duty of reasonable care. In this case,
however,  since  the  reporter  knew  that  there  was  no  basis  for  her
statement,  her  misrepresentation  was  intentional.  C  is  incorrect
because  privity  is  not  a  prerequisite  to  liability  for  intentional
misrepresentation.

104. D One who inherits an interest in realty takes it subject to any existing
prior interests. Since the landowner's accountant and brother received
interests prior to the death of the landowner, and since both of those
interests  were  immediately  recorded,  the  landowner's  nephew  and
niece  took  their  interests  in  the  realty  subject  to  those  of  the
accountant and the brother. Thus, the accountant is entitled to succeed
in a foreclosure proceeding. Because of the constitutional requirement

1260

of due process, however, persons who may be deprived of property
as  the  result  of  a  judicial  proceeding  must  be  given  notice  of  an
opportunity  to  be  heard  in  that  proceeding.  For  this  reason,  all
persons  with  existing  present  or  future  interests  in  the  realty  are
necessary parties who must be served with process in a foreclosure
proceeding. Deciding who must be served thus requires nothing more
than determining who holds a property interest — present or future —
in  the  realty.  Since  the  landowner's  nephew  is  the  holder  of  a  life
estate (i.e.,  has  a  present  interest),  and  the  landowner's  niece  is  the
holder of a remainder (i.e., has a future interest), both are necessary
parties. Since neither has been served or brought into the proceeding,
the accountant's request for a foreclosure sale must be denied.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

105.  A  Murder  is  the  unlawful  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought. Malice aforethought consists of a wanton disregard for
human life, or of the intent to kill, inflict great bodily harm, resist a
lawful  arrest,  escape  from  custody,  or  commit  a  dangerous  felony.
Because  it  was  very  likely  to  lead  to  death  or  serious  injury,  the
defendant's firing slightly to the right of the victim probably showed a
wanton disregard for human life. This is particularly so in view of the
fact that the defendant had never fired a rifle before, and therefore he
could not have been sure that he would miss the victim. Thus, since
the defendant caused the unjustified killing of the victim with malice
aforethought,  he  could  properly  be  convicted  of  murder.  While  it  is
not certain that he would be convicted, murder is the only crime listed
of which he could possibly be properly convicted.

Voluntary  manslaughter  is  the  intentional  killing  of  a  human  being
under mitigating circumstances. Since the defendant did not intend to
hit  the  victim  with  the  bullet,  he  cannot  be  guilty  of  voluntary
manslaughter.  Thus,  B  is  incorrect.  A  person  is  guilty  of  a  criminal
attempt when, with the intent of bringing about a criminally prohibited
result,  he  comes  largely  close  to  achieving  that  result.  Thus,  while
murder does not require the intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm,
attempted  murder  does.  The  defendant  did  not  intend  to  inflict  harm
upon the victim, so he cannot be guilty of attempted murder. Thus, C
is  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  knowledge  that  the  location  is
within  the  municipal  limits  is  an  essential  element  of  guilt,  and  the
defendant did not know the dump was within these limits.

1261

106. C The fact that a witness has made prior statements that are inconsistent
with her testimony suggests that her testimony is not worthy of belief.
For  this  reason,  such  statements  are  admissible  for  purposes  of
impeachment.  In  general,  substantive  evidence  is  admissible  if  it
tends to establish a fact in issue. Since the color of the traffic light is
material  to  the  determination  of  the  plaintiff's  rights  against  the
defendant (i.e., is a fact in issue), the deposition in which the witness
said  that  the  light  was  green  for  the  plaintiff  is  relevant  evidence.
Hearsay is ordinarily defined as an out-of-court statement offered to
prove  the  truth  of  the  matter  that  it  asserts.  FRE  801(d)(1)(A)
specifically provides, however, that a deposition given under oath is
not hearsay so long as the person who gave it is available for cross-
examination. Thus, the witness's deposition is not hearsay although it
was  made  out  of  court  and  is  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  a  matter
asserted  in  it.  For  this  reason,  it  is  admissible  as  substantive
evidence. A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

107.  C  Under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  4(k)(1)(B),  “serving  a  summons  or  filing  a
waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant
. . . who is a party joined under Rule 14 or 19 and is served within a
judicial district of the United States and not more than 100 miles from
where  the  summons  was  issued.”  Here,  the  chef  is  impleading  the
waiter under Fed. R. Civ. P. 14(a)(1), since the waiter may be liable
to the chef for all or part of the professor's claim. Consequently, since
the waiter lives within 100 miles of the court where the summons was
issued, the federal district court in State A has personal jurisdiction
over her.

A is incorrect because of the 100-mile rule stated above. B and D are
incorrect because the amount in controversy and the citizenship of the
parties  is  irrelevant  to  the  question  of  whether  the  federal  district
court in State A would have personal jurisdiction over the parties.

108. B The Thirteenth Amendment provides that, except as a punishment for
crime,  “Neither  slavery  nor  involuntary  servitude  .  .  .  shall  exist
within the United States,” and grants Congress the power to enforce
that  provision.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  the
prohibition against slavery was directed at individuals as well as at
government action. This, the Court stated, gives Congress the power
to  define  badges  of  servitude  and  to  eliminate  them  by  enacting
legislation  regulating  private  conduct.  The  Court  further  ruled  that

1262

racial discrimination could constitute a badge of slavery.

individual  rights.  Since 

The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  has  been  held  to
the  Fifth
protect  certain  substantive 
Amendment  protects  only  against  action  by  the  federal  government,
however, it could not justify the regulation of private conduct. Thus,
A  is  incorrect.  Since  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits  only
invidious discrimination by states, C is incorrect for the same reason.
The Fifteenth Amendment provides that the right to vote shall not be
denied  on  account  of  race  or  previous  condition  of  servitude.  Since
the legislation in question does not protect the right to vote, it cannot
be justified by the Fifteenth Amendment. D is therefore incorrect.

109. D A contract may make the happening of a particular event a condition
precedent to the performance of a contractual duty. If so, one party's
strict  compliance  with  the  condition  makes  the  other  party's
conditional  duty  absolute.  The  terms  of  the  commission  agreement
made the broker's delivery prior to April 15 of a buyer ready, willing,
and  able  to  pay  $50,000  for  the  realty  a  condition  precedent  to  the
seller's duty to pay a commission. Since the broker complied with that
condition by presenting the buyer's offer on April 14, the seller's duty
to pay has become absolute.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  commission  agreement  did  not  make
completion of the sale a condition precedent to the seller's obligation
to pay a commission. If an agreement specifies its own duration, then
the  obligations  that  it  creates  are  understood  to  exist  for  the  period
specified.  The  commission  agreement  required  the  broker  to  make
reasonable  efforts  to  sell  the  realty  until  April  15  and  required  the
seller to pay a commission if the broker procured a buyer prior to that
date.  Those  obligations,  therefore,  continued  to  exist  until  April  15.
The seller's rejection of the buyer's offer of April 10 terminated the
buyer's offer but did not affect the obligations created by the seller's
contract  with  the  broker.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  Statute  of
Frauds  simply  provides  that  certain  agreements  are  unenforceable
over objection unless they are in writing and signed by the party to be
charged. The Statute of Frauds would thus prevent the enforcement of
any  contract  that  is  claimed  to  have  been  formed  as  a  result  of  the
buyer's  April  10  offer.  C  is  incorrect  for  this  reason  and  because
while the Statute of Frauds may prevent an alleged oral contract from
being  enforced,  it  does  not  have  any  effect  on  the  validity  of  the

1263

rejection of an offer.

110. B  There  are  only  three  potential  bases  of  liability  in  a  tort  action  —
intent, negligence, and liability without fault (i.e., strict liability). It is
clear from the facts that the defendant's entry onto the plaintiff's realty
was  not  intentional.  Operating  an  automobile  is  not  one  of  the
activities  for  which  strict  liability  is  imposed.  The  only  possible
basis of liability is therefore negligence. Thus, the defendant can be
liable only if she was negligent. Here, she was negligent because she
was driving 15 miles per hour above the speed limit.

A  is  incorrect  because  an  unauthorized  entry  onto  realty  is  not  a
trespass unless it is intentional. The doctrine of “last clear chance” is
practically  obsolete,  but  where  it  is  applicable,  its  only  effect  is  to
relieve a plaintiff of the consequences of his or her own contributory
negligence. Since the defendant is not the plaintiff, whether or not she
had  the  “last  clear  chance”  to  avoid  an  accident  is  irrelevant.  C  is
therefore incorrect. The privilege of necessity permits the reasonable
violation  of  property  rights  in  the  face  of  an  emergency.  D  is
incorrect, however, for two reasons: First, necessity is available only
as  a  defense  to  intentional  tort,  and  second  —  even  under  the
privilege  of  necessity  —  one  who  invades  the  property  rights  of
another  to  protect  his  or  her  own  interests  must  pay  for  any  actual
damage that results from that invasion.

111. D  It  is  generally  understood  that  even  while  testifying,  a  witness  may
look at any document (in fact, at anything at all) that serves to refresh
his  or  her  recollection  about  the  matters  to  which  he  or  she  is
testifying.  Although  there  are  dangers  connected  with  this  rule,  it  is
thought  that  these  can  be  averted  by  investing  the  judge  with
discretion to determine, while listening to the testimony, whether the
witness's recollection has really been refreshed by consulting such a
document, or whether the witness has no real present recollection but
is  simply  reading  from  the  document.  Since  the  plaintiff  had  not  yet
looked at  the  notes  or  stated  that  looking  at  them  would  refresh  her
recollection,  the  judge  is  not  yet  in  a  position  to  exercise  this
discretion and must overrule the objection.

A  is  incorrect  because  any  material  may  be  used  to  refresh  the
recollection of a witness, without regard to the origin of that material.
B is incorrect because even material that has not been admitted or is
not  capable  of  being  admitted  may  be  used  to  refresh  a  witness's

1264

recollection.  A  leading  question  is  one  that  suggests  a  particular
answer.  C  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  there  are  occasions
when a direct examiner is permitted to stimulate a witness's memory
through the use of leading questions, and second, since the attorney's
question did not suggest a particular answer, it was not leading.

112.  C  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  constitutional
requirements  of  equality  in  the  electoral  process  prohibit  the  use  of
property ownership as a qualification for voter eligibility in general
elections. An exception to this rule has been recognized for special-
purpose  elections  on  matters  that  relate  only  to  the  interests  of
landowners.  The  election  in  question  does  not  fit  this  exception,
however, since municipal revenues and their source are of interest to
all residents of the municipality. For this reason, the land ownership
requirement probably makes the special election invalid.

The  Fifteenth  Amendment  only  prohibits  exclusion  of  persons  from
the  electoral  process  on  the  basis  of  race,  color,  or  previous
condition of servitude. A  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication
that any persons will be excluded from voting in the special election
on this basis. B is incorrect because the United States Supreme Court
has held that states can constitutionally limit the vote to residents and
has specifically upheld residence requirements of up to 50 days, and
because persons owning land within the township are not necessarily
residents of the township. D is incorrect for two reasons: First, unlike
the  election  of  representatives,  which  may  be  conducted  by  district,
this is an election that could not be conducted in any other way but at-
large,  and  second,  in  the  absence  of  a  specific  intent  to  dilute  the
power of a particular interest group, at-large elections are valid even
if they have that effect.

113. D  Upon  breach  by  a  buyer,  UCC  §2-706  provides  that  the  seller  may
resell  the  goods  in  a  commercially  reasonable  manner  and  recover
damages equivalent to the difference between the contract price and
the price that the seller actually received upon the resale. Here, since
the plaintiff resold the chairs at the same price that she had agreed to
accept from the defendant, she has sustained no damage at all. (Note:
If the plaintiff incurred extra expense in making 75 individual sales of
one chair each, rather than a single sale of 75 chairs as agreed by the
defendant,  recovery  for  the  extra  expense  might  be  available  as
incidental damages. D  is  correct,  however,  because  the  facts  do  not

1265

indicate that any extra expense was actually incurred, and because no
other  answer  listed  correctly  describes  damages  that  might  be
available.)

Where  the  goods  that  a  breaching  buyer  contracted  to  buy  are  in
unlimited supply, the seller may be entitled to recover the profit that
the seller would have realized if not for the breach. Since there were
a limited number of chairs, however, and since the plaintiff succeeded
in  selling  them  all,  she  is  not  entitled  to  this  remedy.  A  is  therefore
incorrect. B  is  incorrect  because  the  defendant  did  not  agree  to  pay
$100  per  chair,  and  C  is  incorrect  because  when  the  seller  resells
under  UCC  §2-706,  the  damages  are  measured  by  the  difference
between the contract price and the price that she actually received.

114. A Generally it is the judge's function to decide whether offered evidence
may  be  considered  by  the  jury  (i.e.,  is  admissible),  and  the  jury's
function to decide what weight to give evidence that the judge decides
they  may  consider.  To  find  them  admissible,  a  judge  must  determine
whether  photographs  offered  into  evidence  have  been  properly
authenticated.  A  party  seeking  to  authenticate  a  photograph  must
establish that the photograph is an accurate representation of what it
purports  to  picture.  The  plaintiff  has  authenticated  his  photo  by
testifying that he took it of the stove in question and that it accurately
represents  the  stove.  The  employee  has  authenticated  his  photo  by
testifying  that  it  accurately  represents  the  stove  in  question.  Both
photos  have  thus  been  sufficiently  authenticated  to  be  admitted  into
evidence.  It  will  then  be  the  jury's  job  to  decide  which  witness  it
believes — if any — and which photo it therefore believes to be an
accurate representation of the stove in question.

B is incorrect because the employee's testimony that his photo fairly
and  accurately  represents  the  stove  sufficiently  authenticates  it  even
though  he  was  not  the  photographer.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
plaintiff's  testimony  that  he  took  the  snapshot  and  that  it  accurately
represents the stove sufficiently authenticates it. D is incorrect for a
combination of the reasons that make B and C incorrect.

115.  B  Restraints  on  the  alienation  of  leasehold  interests  are  generally
regarded  as  valid  but  are  strictly  construed.  For  this  reason,  a
restraint  against  assignment  is  held  not  to  prohibit  sublease.
Assignment of a lease takes place when a lessee transfers to another
his or her entire remaining interest in the premises. If any interest less

1266

than  this  is  transferred,  the  transfer  is  a  sublease  rather  than  an
assignment.  Since  the  attorney  retained  a  right  to  one  of  the  offices,
his transfer to the second attorney was not an assignment and did not
breach the lease provision prohibiting assignments.

A  is  incorrect  because  if  a  transfer  of  the  lessee's  entire  remaining
interest occurs, the transfer is an assignment even though the terms in
the agreement between assignor and assignee are not identical to the
terms  in  the  agreement  between  the  landlord  and  assignor.  Although
courts generally disfavor restraints on the alienation of fee interests in
realty, C  is  incorrect  because  clauses  prohibiting  the  assignment  of
leasehold  interests  are  generally  regarded  as  valid.  The  financial
status  of  a  prospective  tenant  is  only  one  of  the  factors  which  a
landlord  considers  in  deciding  whether  to  rent  to  him  or  her.  (For
example,  a  landlord  might  be  unwilling  to  rent  to  a  person  with  a
good  credit  rating  if  that  person  has  a  history  of  damaging  leased
premises or engages in an occupation inconsistent with other uses of
the premises.) D is therefore incorrect.

116. B  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  because  defamation
liability can be imposed only for a false statement, and because there
is  no  such  thing  as  a  false  opinion,  defamation  liability  cannot  be
imposed  for  an  assertion  of  opinion.  The  Supreme  Court  also  ruled
that a statement is an assertion of opinion if reasonable readers would
recognize that it was an expression of the writer's feelings and would
not  believe  that  it  was  intended  to  assert  a  fact.  Thus,  if  reasonable
readers would not believe that the statement asserted a fact, it was an
expression  of  opinion  and  therefore  not  subject  to  defamation
liability.

Although  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  a  public  person  suing  for
defamation  must  prove  actual  malice  (i.e.,  knowledge  of  falsity  or
reckless  disregard  for  truth),  this  requirement  has  not  been  imposed
on private persons. For this reason, the defendant could be liable for
publishing  a  defamatory  statement  about  the  plaintiff  that  he
negligently believed to be true, even if he did not have actual malice
when he made it. A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  statement,  even  if  it  is
defamatory,  will  not  subject  its  publisher  to  defamation  liability
unless it is false. But a defamatory statement is said to be false if it is
not substantially true, without regard to whether or not the reasonable
person would believe it. If damage results from the publication of a

1267

statement  found  to  be  defamatory  (which  does  depend  on  what  the
reasonable  person  would  think  it  means)  and  false  (which  does  not
depend at all on what the reasonable person would think), defamation
liability is imposed. Although the amount of damage will probably be
related  to  the  number  of  people  who  believed  the  defamatory
statement  and  held  it  against  the  plaintiff,  it  does  not  depend  on
whether  or  not  those  who  did  so  were  reasonable  people.  The
argument  in  C  would  not  therefore  be  an  effective  defense  for  the
defendant. Although (for reasons stated above) defamation liability is
not  imposed  for  stating  an  opinion,  it  may  be  imposed  for  a  false
assertion of fact even though the maker of that statement believed it to
be  true.  Thus,  if  the  defendant's  statement  was  defamatory,  and  if  it
was a false assertion of fact, the defendant could not escape liability
by  proving  that  he  believed  it  (i.e.,  in  his  opinion  it  was  accurate)
unless his belief was reasonable. D is therefore incorrect.

117. D An illusory promise is a statement that appears to make a promise but
does  not  commit  the  promisor  to  do  anything.  Illusory  promises  are
insufficient consideration to support a contract. Here, the builder has
not bound himself to do anything since he's only agreed to buy bricks
for $1 if he decides to buy bricks. Because the builder's promise did
not actually bind him in any way, it did not provide consideration for
the  brick  supplier's  promise.  Consequently,  the  brick  supplier  could
not be bound to its promise.

A is incorrect because it appears to be referencing the rules for a firm
offer  under  UCC  §  2-205.  Under  that  section,  a  promise  to  keep  an
offer  open  is  enforceable  without  consideration  if  the  promisor  is  a
merchant,  offering  to  buy  or  sell  goods  in  a  signed  writing,  and  the
writing  gives  assurances  that  it  will  be  held  open.  In  that  case,  the
offer is not revocable for lack of consideration during the time stated,
or if no time is stated, for a reasonable time (in no event exceeding
three  months).  Here,  it  doesn't  seem  that  the  supplier  is  giving  any
assurances  regarding  holding  the  offer  open,  the  supplier's  letter
includes no promised time, and the builder made his order six months
later, so the rules regarding a firm offer could not apply. Importantly,
this is not the situation of a requirements contract, as the builder made
no  promise  to  buy  his  required  brick  from  the  brick  supplier.  B  is
incorrect because the letter sent by the builder was not an acceptance.
As stated above, it was an illusory promise. C is  incorrect  because
the reason for the price increase is irrelevant to the analysis.

1268

118. C Since the restriction to residential use was contained in the deed by
which  the  sister  received  her  interest  in  Lot  2,  there  is  no  question
about whether the restriction is enforceable against her. But since her
brother was not a party to the transaction in which the restriction on
his sister's use was created (i.e., the conveyance of Lot 2), a question
exists  about  whether  that  restriction  is  enforceable  by  the  brother.
The  facts  are  unclear  about  who  purchased  first.  (If  the  sister
purchased  before  her  brother,  the  question  would  be  an  easier  one.
Then,  the  benefit  that  the  landowner  received  from  the  restriction  in
his sister's deed probably ran with the landowner's land and probably
passed to the brother with the conveyance of Lot 1. Unfortunately, this
is not one of the options.) Even if the brother purchased first, he may
be able to enforce the restriction in his sister's deed if, at the time of
his purchase, he relied on a representation by the landowner that Lot
2  would  be  similarly  restricted.  In  that  event,  the  brother  might
succeed  on  two  theories:  first,  that  he  was  an  intended  creditor
beneficiary  of  his  sister's  covenant,  and  second,  that  there  were
implied  reciprocal  servitudes.  One  way  of  establishing  reliance  on
such  a  representation  would  be  to  show  that  at  the  time  of  his
purchase,  the  brother  was  aware  that  the  restriction  was  part  of  the
landowner's development scheme. The additional fact in C might thus
result in a decision for the brother.

If  the  brother  purchased  before  his  sister,  the  benefit  that  the
landowner  received  from  the  restriction  in  his  brother's  deed
probably passed to his sister with Lot 2 because that benefit ran with
the land. For this reason, the facts in A and B might be relevant if the
sister was trying to enforce the restriction contained in her brother's
deed.  They  are  irrelevant  to  the  brother's  attempt  to  enforce  the
restriction contained in his sister's deed, however. For this reason, A
and  B  are  incorrect.  If  the  sister  purchased  before  her  brother,  she
might  be  able  to  enforce  the  restriction  in  her  brother's  deed  by
showing that she was aware of the landowner's development scheme
when  he  purchased.  But  since  the  question  involves  the  brother's
attempt to enforce the restriction in his sister's deed, D is incorrect.

119.  A  The  Fifth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United  States
Constitution provide in part that no person shall be deprived of life,
liberty,  or  property  without  due  process  of  law.  Since  the  plaintiff's
claim is that the agency's decision violated his right to due process,
his claim must fail unless the decision deprived him of life, liberty, or

1269

property.  If  it  did  not,  he  was  not  entitled  to  due  process  in  the
decision-making  process.  Cases  have  held  that  if  a  state  employee's
contract  provides  that  the  state  may  decide  not  to  rehire  him  or  her
without  cause,  the  employee's  expectation  of  being  rehired  is  not  a
sufficient property interest to require due process. Thus, the argument
in  A  would  probably  be  successful.  Even  without  these  cases,
however, A would be the only argument listed that could possibly be
an effective response to the plaintiff's challenge.

Although no person has a right to state employment (i.e., no person is
guaranteed employment by the state), the distinction between right and

“entitlement”  that  is  seen  to  be  a  property  interest.  B  is  therefore
incorrect.  C 
the  hearing  officer  would
presumably  act  properly  in  considering  whatever  evidence  the
plaintiff  might  submit  and  therefore  might  not  come  to  the  same
conclusion  as  the  agency.  D  is  incorrect  because  it  is  based  on  an
over-inclusive  statement;  even  though  the  contract  provided  that  the
decision not to renew could be made without cause, it could still have
been  made  for  a  reason  (e.g.,  based  on  race)  or  in  a  manner
inconsistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  Constitution,  thus  violating
the plaintiff's constitutional rights.

120. A Private nuisance is a tortious interference with the plaintiff's right to
use  and  enjoy  realty,  and  it  may  be  committed  without  any  physical
intrusion onto the realty. Although the county ordinance permitted use
of the airport by certain aircraft, the defendant could still be liable for
private nuisance if he was operating the airport in a manner other than
that  contemplated  by  the  ordinance.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  the
plaintiff  would  recover  on  this  theory,  private  nuisance  is  the  only
theory listed that could possibly result in a judgment in his favor.

It  is  sometimes  held  that  repeated  overflights  for  a  given  period  of
time  result  in  a  prescriptive  aeronautical  easement.  B  is  incorrect,
however,  because  this  conclusion  would  privilege  the  continuing
overflights, thus providing the defendant with a defense to an action
brought  by  the  plaintiff.  The  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States
Constitution  prohibits  the  taking  by  government  of  private  property
for  public  use  without  just  compensation.  If  the  county  ordinance
resulted  in  a  reduction  in  the  value  of  the  plaintiff's  realty,  the  Fifth
Amendment might require that the county pay just compensation to the

1270

plaintiff.  Although  this  right  would  be  enforceable  in  an  inverse
condemnation  proceeding,  C  is  incorrect  because  this  theory  is
available only against an agency of the government. Trespass to land
and  the  variant  known  as  continuing  trespass  require  a  physical  or
tangible  entry  onto  the  realty.  D  is  incorrect  because  noise  is  not
tangible.

121. C  An  “admission”  is  a  statement  by  a  party  offered  against  that  party.
Under the common law, it is admissible as an exception to the hearsay
rule;  under  FRE  801(d)(2),  it  is  not  hearsay.  Since  the  defendant's
statement  to  his  wife  is  offered  against  the  defendant,  it  is  an
admission and therefore admissible.

The marital privilege is designed to protect the confidentiality of the
marital  relationship.  For  this  reason,  it  prevents  either  spouse  from
testifying over objection by the other to a confidential communication
made during the marriage. For the same reason, however, it does not
prevent a stranger to the marriage from testifying to a communication
that  he  or  she  overheard  between  the  spouses.  Thus,  although
communications  made  within  the  marriage  are  presumed  to  be
confidential, A  is  incorrect  because  the  witness  did  not  receive  the
communication within the marriage (i.e., as a marriage partner). B is
incorrect  because  an  admission  is  not  hearsay  under  FRE  801(d)(2)
and it is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under common
law.  Communications  that  advance  a  crime  are  not  protected  by
privilege.  The  defendant's  statement  did  not  advance  a  crime,
however,  because  it  was  about  a  crime  that  had  already  been
committed. The fact that it concerned a crime is not enough to take it
out of the protection of the marital privilege, making D incorrect.

122. D If an action is in federal court based on federal question jurisdiction,
a federal court has discretion to remand the case to state court once
all  the  federal  questions  have  been  resolved  based  on  principles  of
fairness  and  judicial  economy.  See  Carnegie-Mellon  University  v.
Cohill,  484  U.S.  343  (1988).  Here,  considering  the  action  was
originally brought in state court and only state claims remain, it would
be  more  practical  and  fair  to  remand  the  case  to  the  state  court.
Therefore, A and B are incorrect.

C  is  incorrect  because  the  district  court's  discretion  to  remand  the
case  to  state  court  is  not  based  on  the  simple  fact  the  case  was
originally brought in state court.

1271

123. B A basic principle of the law of evidence is that only evidence that is
relevant to a material issue may be received in evidence. Evidence is
logically relevant to a material issue if it has any tendency to prove or
disprove a fact of consequence. Since the defendant is charged with
assaulting the victim, not the witness, his beating of the witness could
not  tend  to  prove  or  disprove  a  fact  of  consequence  in  the
prosecution.  (It  might  seem  logical  to  argue  that  the  witness's
testimony  tends  to  establish  that  the  defendant  is  the  kind  of  person
who is likely to have committed the crime with which he is charged.
All  jurisdictions  agree,  however,  that  evidence  of  a  defendant's
character  is  not  admissible  to  create  the  inference  that  he  or  she
engaged in particular conduct on a particular occasion.)

In  some  jurisdictions,  confidential  marital  communications  are
privileged  and  cannot  be  revealed  —  even  after  the  marriage  has
terminated — over the objection of the spouse against whom they are
offered.  There  is  some  disagreement  about  whether  this  privilege
applies  to  acts  as  well  as  communications.  It  is  generally  agreed,
however, that communications or acts are privileged only if they were
intended to be confidential. The fact that the acts to which the witness
testified  occurred  in  public  places  indicates  that  they  were  not
intended  to  be  confidential,  and  the  privilege  therefore  does  not
apply. A is incorrect for this reason and because, as explained above,
the  testimony  may  be  excluded  even  if  the  jurisdiction  did  not
recognize  the  marital  privilege.  The  credibility  of  a  witness  may  be
impeached by evidence relating to his or her reputation for truth and
veracity. C is incorrect, however, for two reasons: First, the witness's
testimony does not logically relate to the defendant's reputation at all,
and second, FRE 608(b) specifically provides that extrinsic evidence
(except  for  convictions)  of  specific  conduct  may  not  be  used  to
impeach  the  credibility  of  a  witness.  Although  a  defendant  who
testifies  in  his  or  her  own  behalf  may  be  impeached  by  cross-
examination (i.e.,  intrinsically)  regarding  past  conduct,  FRE  608(b)
prevents the use of extrinsic evidence of specific acts of unconvicted
bad conduct. D is therefore incorrect.

124. C  Under  the  doctrine  of  impossibility  of  performance,  a  party  may  be
excused from obligations under a contract if an unforeseeable change
in  circumstances  has  made  performance  vitally  different  than  that
which  was  contemplated  by  the  parties  at  the  time  the  contract  was
formed.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  change  that  occurred  was

1272

foreseeable, the fact that it increases a party's burden of performance
is  not  in  itself  sufficient  to  excuse  that  performance.  Because
contracts  must  remain  stable  even  when  the  market  does  not,  it  is
generally  understood  that,  for  this  purpose,  fluctuations  in  market
price are foreseeable. In any event, if dramatic fluctuation in the price
of chickens was foreseeable, then the increase in market price would
not excuse the defendant's performance.

A  is  incorrect  because  if  the  change  was  foreseeable,  it  does  not
matter  whether  the  parties  actually  knew  that  it  would  occur.  In  an
“aleatory” contract, one party agrees to confer a benefit on the other
upon the happening of a fortuitous event over which neither party has
control (e.g., X agrees to pay Y if Y's roll of the dice comes up 7).
Since the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant was not
conditioned upon the happening of any event over which neither had
control, it was not aleatory. B is therefore incorrect. (Note: Under the
reasoning of option B, all contracts for the future payment of money
would be aleatory and invalid.) D is incorrect for two reasons: First,
the  rights  of  the  parties  would  be  the  same  under  common  law  as
under  the  UCC,  and  second,  the  transaction  is  deemed  a  sale  by  the
language of the UCC, which defines a sale as a passing of title from
the seller to the buyer for a price.

125.  C  When  an  easement  is  created  by  grant,  the  language  of  the  grant
determines the scope of the easement. When that language is unclear,
the courts most often determine the scope of the easement on the basis
of  what  could  reasonably  have  been  anticipated  at  the  time  the
easement  was  created.  Although  there  are  insufficient  facts  to
determine whether the argument in C would result in a judgment for
the plaintiff, it is the only argument listed that could possibly support
his position.

If  an  easement  is  created  by  adverse  use  over  a  specified  period  of
time  (i.e.,  by  prescription),  the  use  over  that  period  determines  the
scope of the easement. If the easement is created by grant, however,
its scope is determined by the language of the grant, construed in the
light of what the parties contemplated at the time of its creation. A is
therefore  incorrect.  The  initial  installment  of  a  single  pipe  by  the
defendant might be evidence of what the parties contemplated at the
time the easement was created. It is not conclusive, however, because
the  scope  of  an  easement  is  usually  understood  to  include  those

1273

changes in the activities of the dominant estate that could reasonably
have  been  foreseen.  Thus,  although  the  defendant  installed  only  one
pipe, it may be found that the parties anticipated that the installation
of a second pipe might one day be necessary. If so, that anticipation
would  be  relevant  in  determining  the  scope  of  the  easement  granted
by the language given. B is therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because
where the granting language is not sufficiently specific, the scope of
the easement is determined as explained above.

126. D  Since  the  sales  contract  called  for  delivery  of  marketable  title  to  a
parcel  consisting  of  four  lots,  the  buyer  could  not  be  required  to
accept  anything 
including
easements  —  make  a  title  unmarketable.  Since  one  of  the  four  lots
was  encumbered  by  an  easement,  the  seller  was  unable  to  deliver
marketable title and was, therefore, in breach of contract.

less.  Outstanding  encumbrances  — 

A  covenant  against  encumbrances  is  breached  if  an  encumbrance
exists at the time of conveyance, and it gives rise to an action against
the covenantor for any damage resulting from the existence of such an
encumbrance.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  marketable  title
means a title that can be enjoyed without the likelihood of litigation,
and  title  to  encumbered  realty  is  likely  to  lead  to  litigation.  Since
there may be reasons why the buyer would want to purchase a parcel
consisting  of  four  lots  but  not  a  parcel  consisting  of  three  lots,  he
cannot be required to accept less than what he bargained for. Having
bargained for a parcel consisting of four lots, he cannot therefore be
compelled  to  accept  a  deed  to  only  three  of  them.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. In a tort action for intentional misrepresentation, it would
be  necessary  for  the  buyer  to  show  that  the  seller  knew  that  the
easement  existed  when  he  promised  to  deliver  marketable  title.
Breach of contract liability is not based on fault, however, and may
be imposed simply because the promisor has failed to keep a promise
that he or she made. Since the seller promised to deliver marketable
title (i.e., title free of encumbrances), he may be liable for breaching
that  contract  without  regard  to  whether  he  knew  that  it  would  be
breached when he made it. For this reason, C is incorrect.

127.  A  For  various  reasons,  the  law  recognizes  a  policy  to  encourage
settlements. Since a party might refrain from making a settlement offer
if  he  or  she  believed  that  his  or  her  offer  could  be  used  as
circumstantial evidence of his or her liability, this policy prohibits the

1274

admission as evidence of the offerer's liability of an offer to settle or
compromise a claim.

Since the offerer's explanation for his or her offer would not always
prevent  the  offerer  from  convincing  a  jury  of  his  or  her  liability,
policy would prevent the admission of evidence of the offer even if
the  offerer  was  given  an  opportunity  to  explain  it.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. Although a declaration against pecuniary interest may be an
exception to the hearsay rule, and although the admission of a party is
an exception to the hearsay rule under common law, and not hearsay
at  all  under  FRE  801(d)(2),  C  and  D  are  incorrect  since  the
settlement  offer  is  being  excluded,  not  because  it  is  hearsay,  but
because of the policy to encourage settlements.

128. B The plaintiff in a negligence action must establish that the defendant
breached  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  and  that  the  breach  was  a
proximate  cause  of  damage.  In  concept,  a  plaintiff  has  sustained
damage  as  a  result  of  a  defendant's  act  if  the  plaintiff  would  have
been better off without that act. If the plaintiff otherwise would have
died, then the defendant's act saved the plaintiff's life at the expense
of his injured knees. Since the plaintiff's life was more important (i.e.,
valuable)  than  his  knees,  he  would  not  have  been  better  off  without
the defendant's act and therefore sustained no damage.

Since a result might have several proximate causes, any damage that
the  plaintiff  did  sustain  could  have  been  proximately  caused  by  the
negligence of the defendant and by the negligence of the driver. This
would make the defendant and the driver joint tortfeasors — in most
jurisdictions,  jointly  and  severally  liable  for  the  plaintiff's  damage.
For this reason, the fact that the driver's negligence was a proximate
cause of the plaintiff's injury is not likely to result in a judgment for
the defendant. A is therefore incorrect. If the plaintiff was damaged as
a  proximate  result  of  the  negligence  of  the  defendant,  the  defendant
would be liable for the plaintiff's damage. This is true regardless of
any  injuries  that  the  defendant  might  have  sustained.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.  Ordinarily,  a  person  who  acts  is  required  to  act  as  the
the  same  circumstances.  Since
reasonable  person  would 
emergencies call for quick response without time for cool reflection,
a person confronted with an emergency is not required to act as he or
she would if not confronted by an emergency. He or she is, however,
required  to  act  like  the  reasonable  person  would  if  confronted  with

in 

1275

the same emergency. Thus, the fact that an emergency existed does not
excuse  a  defendant  from  the  obligation  of  acting  reasonably.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

129. D The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that
no person shall for the same offense be placed twice in jeopardy of
life or limb. In general, this prevents a person from being tried twice
for  the  same  crime.  Since  the  defendant  has  already  been  tried,  the
subsequent  prosecution  violates  this  constitutional  protection.  D  is
correct for this reason, and because none of the reasons listed in the
other options is sufficient to result in a denial of her motion.

For  the  protection  against  double  jeopardy  to  be  violated  by
prosecution  for  a  crime,  it  must  be  found  that  the  defendant  has
already been in danger (i.e., jeopardy) of losing his or her liberty as a
result  of  a  prosecution  for  the  same  crime  and  that  the  danger  has
ended.  If  the  danger  to  the  defendant  that  was  created  by  the  first
prosecution  has  ended,  subsequent  prosecution  would  place  her  in
danger  again,  thus  violating  the  Double  Jeopardy  Clause.  A  is
therefore incorrect. It is sometimes argued that a reversal based on a
legal  flaw  in  the  trial  results  in  the  conclusion  that  the  trial  was  a
nullity and that jeopardy therefore never attached in the first place. If
this  were  so,  subsequent  prosecution  would  not  violate  the  Double
Jeopardy  Clause  because  the  defendant  was  never  in  danger  as  a
result of the previous prosecution. B  is  incorrect,  however,  because
the reversal by the appellate court was not based on a legal flaw but
on insufficiency of the evidence that is equivalent to an acquittal after
trial.  Usually  a  convicted  defendant  who  appeals  his  or  her
conviction thereby waives the constitutional protection against double
jeopardy. A reversal based on insufficiency of the evidence, however,
indicates  that  the  initial  trial  should  have  resulted  in  an  acquittal,
which would have barred re-prosecution, and so in such a case, the
defendant does not waive his or her rights under the Double Jeopardy
Clause. C is therefore incorrect.

130. A Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3), a statement prepared by a party “in
anticipation  of  litigation”  is  protected  by  work-product  immunity.
However, since the statement is simply the statement of the head nurse
and does not appear to contain any mental conclusions or impressions
by  the  investigator,  it  is  probably  only  protected  by  qualified
immunity.  In  that  case,  the  man  can  get  the  statement  if  he  shows  he

1276

has  “substantial  need  for  the  materials  .  .  .  and  [he]  cannot,  without
undue  hardship,  obtain  their  substantial  equivalent  by  other  means.”
Since the head nurse related information that was known only to her
regarding  what  happened  during  the  surgery,  the  fact  she  has  died
means  the  man  is  likely  entitled  to  the  information.  Therefore,  C  is
incorrect.

the 

lawyer  and  work  prepared  by 

B is incorrect because work-product immunity applies both to work
prepared  by 
the  party's
“representative  (including  the  other  party's  attorney,  consultant,
surety,  indemnitor,  insurer,  or  agent).”  Consequently,  the  fact  it  was
the  investigator  who  did  the  interview  and  not  the  lawyer  is
irrelevant. D is incorrect because the issue doesn't revolve around the
question of whether the information was obtained by another working
on the attorney's behalf.

131. A Under the parol evidence rule, extrinsic evidence of prior agreements
or  negotiations  is  not  admissible  to  contradict  or  modify  an
unambiguous written contract that the parties intended as a complete
expression  of  their  agreement.  The  rule  does  not  prevent  the  use  of
extrinsic  evidence  for  other  purposes,  however.  Virtually  all
jurisdictions  permit  its  use  to  show  that  the  written  contract  is
ambiguous  and  to  clear  up  the  ambiguity.  Since  the  phrase  “all  fuel
ordered by the state” might mean all the fuel that the state chooses to
order  from  the  plaintiff,  or  all  the  fuel  that  the  state  orders  at  all
during that period, the contract is probably ambiguous on its face. If it
is not ambiguous on its face, the fact that the advertisement calling for
bids indicated that the contract would be exclusive tends to show an
ambiguity since it might mean that the parties intended the plaintiff to
be  the  exclusive  supplier  even  though  the  written  contract  does  not
specifically say so. The advertisement is probably admissible for this
reason.  Although  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this
conclusion, the argument set forth in A is the only one listed that might
provide  the  plaintiff  with  an  effective  response  to  the  state's
objection.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  parol  evidence  rule  may  prevent  the
admission of extrinsic evidence, whether it is oral or written. C and
D  are  incorrect  because  the  parol  evidence  rule  excludes  extrinsic
evidence  of  statements  made  prior  to  and  during  negotiations  if
offered to modify the terms of an unambiguous written contract.

1277

132.  C  At  common  law,  priorities  were  determined  by  the  dates  of  the
transactions  involved.  The  person  who  received  his  or  her  interest
first  had  priority  over  all  others.  In  all  jurisdictions  in  the  United
States, recording statutes have modified the common law rule. Under
the  statute  given  (typical  of  the  “notice”  variety)  an  unrecorded
interest does not defeat the rights of a subsequent taker for value and
without notice. Since the youngest son received the property as a gift
(i.e., did not give value), however, he is not protected by the statute.
For  this  reason,  the  interest  of  the  neighbor,  since  it  was  created
before that of the youngest son, has priority over it. Since the neighbor
did give value for his interest, and since the facts do not indicate that
he was aware of the oldest son's interest, the neighbor is protected by
the recording statute. Under the statute, the oldest son's interest is not
good  against  the  neighbor,  since  the  oldest  son's  deed  was  not
recorded.  Thus,  the  interest  of  the  neighbor  has  priority,  and  the
neighbor is entitled to foreclose.

Although  the  neighbor  did  not  record  his  mortgage,  it  has  priority
over  the  youngest  son's  interest  because  the  youngest  son  —  not
having given value — is not protected by the recording statute. Under
the  statute,  the  interest  of  the  neighbor  —  which  is  protected  by  the
recording statute — has priority over the previously created interest
of  the  oldest  son  because  the  oldest  son's  interest  was  unrecorded
when the neighbor received the mortgage. A is therefore incorrect. B
is incorrect because the youngest son is not protected by the recording
statute  for  the  reasons  given  above.  Since  the  neighbor's  interest  is
superior  to  the  oldest  son's  under  the  recording  statute,  the  oldest
son's  interest  is  subject  to  the  mortgage  held  by  the  neighbor.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

133. A The plaintiff's allegation that the vehicle was defective means that her
claim is based on the theory of strict liability in tort. Assumption of
the risk may be raised as an effective defense to such a claim. Since a
plaintiff  assumes  the  risk  when  he  or  she  voluntarily  encounters  a
danger of which he or she knows, the plaintiff may have assumed the
risk by driving with the knowledge that the seat belt warning indicator
light was not working.

B  is  incorrect  because  a  product  might  be  defective  even  though  it
does  not  violate  a  safety  statute.  If  the  plaintiff  would  have  ignored
the seat belt warning indicator light, its failure to operate was not a

1278

factual  cause  of  her  harm,  and  the  defendant  could  not  be  liable  for
her  injury.  Factual  cause  is  a  question  of  fact  for  the  jury,  however,
and a plaintiff needs to prove it only by a fair preponderance of the
evidence. Thus, even if the plaintiff cannot prove with certainty that
she  would  have  worn  the  seat  belt  had  the  indicator  been  working,
she may still win her case if the jury finds it more likely than not that
she would have. C is therefore incorrect. A professional seller who
supplies  a  defective  product  is  strictly  liable  for  resulting  harm
whether  or  not  the  defect  resulted  from  that  seller's  fault.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

134. A In a foreclosure sale, the proceeds are first used to pay the attorney's
fees and other expenses of the sale, the principal and interest on the
foreclosed  loan,  and  then  any  junior  mortgages  in  the  order  of  their
priority. If there is anything left over, it goes to the mortgagor. On the
other hand, if the proceeds are insufficient to pay the mortgage debt,
the  mortgagee  can  bring  a  personal  action  against  the  mortgagor
unless  such  an  action  is  prohibited  by  state  law.  Here,  A  correctly
states  these  rules.  If  it  is  not  prohibited  by  state  law,  the  third  bank
may  sue  for  a  personal  judgment  against  the  man  to  recover  the
$10,000 it is owed under the third mortgage.

B  is  incorrect  because  junior  mortgage  holders  do  not  split  the
remaining  proceeds.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  junior  mortgage
holders  do  not  have  priority  over  the  foreclosed  mortgage.  D  is
incorrect because the principal and interest on the first mortgage must
be paid before any proceeds can go to other mortgagees.

135. C  An  admission  is  a  declaration  by  a  party  offered  against  that  party.
Under  the  common  law,  admissions  are  admissible  as  exceptions  to
the  hearsay  rule;  under  FRE  801(d)(2),  admissions  are  not  hearsay.
Matters  to  which  a  party  has  stipulated  on  the  record  are  known  as
“judicial admissions” and are conclusive in the proceeding in which
they  were  made.  Since  the  plaintiff  specified  that  the  information
contained in the industry publication was to be used as its response to
the  defendant's  interrogatories,  the  appropriate  portions  of  the
industry publication may be regarded as a judicial admission.

A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect because an admission is either
admissible hearsay (under common law) or not hearsay at all (under
the  FRE).  A  court  may  take  judicial  notice  of  facts  contained  in  a
reference  work  that  is  shown  to  be  a  reputable  source  beyond

1279

reasonable dispute. Since the portions of the industry publication are
admissible  as  admissions,  however,  judicial  notice  is  not  the  only
way that they would be admissible. D is therefore incorrect.

136.  C  Murder  is  the  unlawful  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought. Among other things, malice aforethought may consist of
the intent to cause serious bodily harm or of a reckless disregard for
human life. Stabbing with a knife is evidence of both these states of
mind. Therefore, if the defendant's stabbing of the victim proximately
caused  the  victim's  death,  it  was  probably  murder.  An  act  is  a
proximate  cause  of  death  if  it  was  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  the
death.  The  defendant's  act  was  a  factual  cause  of  the  victim's  death
because  the  victim's  death  would  not  have  occurred  without  it.
Conduct is a legal cause of death if the death was a foreseeable result
of it, and if there were no superseding intervening causes. The wife's
conduct  was  also  a  cause  of  the  victim's  death,  since  the  victim's
death  would  not  have  occurred  if  the  wife  had  secured  medical
attention. Further, her failure to do so was an intervening cause of the
victim's death because it came after the defendant's act and before the
victim's  death.  If  the  wife's  conduct  was  unforeseeable,  it  can  be
called a superseding intervening cause of death. Under the definition
given above, this would prevent the defendant's conduct from being a
legal (or proximate) cause.

As indicated above, the defendant's conduct was a factual cause of the
victim's  death,  since  the  death  would  not  have  occurred  if  the
defendant  had  not  stabbed  the  victim.  The  wife's  failure  to  secure
prompt  medical  attention  was  also  a  factual  cause  of  the  victim's
death,  since  it  would  not  have  occurred  if  she  had  secured  prompt
medical  attention.  Any  result  may  have  several  causes;  the  fact  that
the wife's conduct was a cause does not establish that the defendant's
was  not.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  If  the  victim's  death  was  an
unforeseeable result of the defendant's act, the defendant's act was not
a proximate cause of it. The term foreseeable, however, means “that
which  the  reasonable  person  would  anticipate.”  Thus,  even  an
unusual  result  may  be  foreseeable.  For  this  reason,  the  fact  that  leg
wounds  do  not  usually  cause  death  does  not  necessarily  justify  the
conclusion that the victim's death was an unforeseeable result of the
defendant's act. B is therefore incorrect. If the wife's conduct was a
substantial  factor  in  producing  the  victim's  death,  it  was  a  factual
cause  of  that  death.  Any  result  may  have  several  proximate  causes,

1280

however. D is incorrect because the defendant's act was also a cause
of the victim's death.

137. C Unless it involves a fundamental right (i.e.,  voting,  or  marriage  and
procreation) or discriminates on the basis of a suspect classification,
state  regulation  of  social  or  economic  interests  is  valid  if  it  has  a
rational  basis.  Since  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that
age is not a suspect classification, the state mandatory retirement law
is valid if it has a rational basis. Under this test, if any state of facts
can be imagined that would make the legislative choice a reasonable
way  to  achieve  a  legitimate  legislative  purpose,  the  law  will  be
upheld.  Since  providing  state  employees  with  the  best  insurance
protection  at  the  lowest  cost  is  a  legitimate  legislative  purpose,  the
mandatory retirement law probably has a rational basis that makes it
valid. (Note: Although it is possible to conclude that the law does not
have  a  rational  basis  because  mandatory  retirement  is  not  a
reasonable  means  of  achieving  this  objective,  C  is  the  only  answer
that could possibly be correct.)

Under the Supremacy Clause, a state law is invalid if it conflicts with
a  valid  federal  law  covering  the  same  subject  matter.  Since  the
federal  law  fixes  the  retirement  age  for  federal  employees,  and  the
state  law  fixes  the  retirement  age  for  state  employees,  the  two  laws
do  not  cover  the  same  subject  matter  and  are  therefore  not
inconsistent  with  each  other.  A  is  thus  incorrect.  A  law  may  have  a
rational  basis  even  though  its  application  to  one  particular  person
does not advance its objective. Thus, if many other state jobs require
skills  or  abilities  that  are  related  to  age,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff's
does  not  will  not  be  sufficient  to  invalidate  the  law.  B  is  therefore
incorrect.  D  is  too  general  a  statement  to  be  correct;  the  federal
government  may  impose  some  economic  burdens  on  the  states  (e.g.,
may tax certain state activities).

138. B If a case is initially not removable to federal court, a defendant has 30
days  to  file  a  notice  of  removal  after  the  case  becomes  removable.
See  28  U.S.C.  §1446(b)(3).  Here,  the  case  became  removable  to
federal  court  once  the  doctor  was  dismissed  because  there  is  now
complete diversity between the plaintiff and defendant and the amount
in  controversy  is  over  $75,000.  Because  the  lawyer  sought  removal
within 30 days, the case can be removed.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  there  is  now  complete  diversity  of

1281

citizenship,  the  lawyer  would  still  need  to  seek  removal  within  30
days of the doctor's dismissal. Consequently, B is a better answer. C
is  incorrect  because  the  lawyer  has  30  days  to  seek  removal.  D  is
incorrect because the fact the banker voluntarily dismissed the doctor
does not change the analysis.

139. B An intervening cause is an event without which the accident would not
have occurred and which took place after the defendant's negligence.
The defendant's encounter with the pothole was, thus, an intervening
cause  of  the  collision.  A  superseding  cause  is  an  unforeseeable
intervening  cause.  In  this  context,  the  word  unforeseeable  may  be
used  to  mean  either  something  that  the  reasonable  person  would  not
have anticipated, or something which, in retrospect, appears to have
been extraordinary. If potholes are frequently found on road surfaces
in  the  area,  the  presence  of  the  pothole  was  foreseeable  (in  either
sense of the word), and could not have been a superseding cause of
harm.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  violation  of  a  statute  may  establish
that  the  defendant  was  negligent,  it  does  not  establish  that  the
defendant's  conduct  was  causally  related  to  the  plaintiff's  injury.  A
superseding  cause  may  relieve  a  defendant  of  liability  by  justifying
the conclusion that his or her conduct was not a legal cause of harm,
whether or not the person responsible for the superseding cause can
be  required  to  compensate  the  plaintiff.  Thus,  the  plaintiff's  liability
does  not  depend  on  whether 
the  Department  of  Highway
Transportation is liable for its negligence or on whether governmental
immunity  has  been  abolished.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  fact  that
the accident would not have occurred without the pothole proves that
the pothole was one of its factual causes. Unless the presence of the
pothole was an unforeseeable intervening cause, however, it was not
a superseding cause of the plaintiff's harm and would not relieve the
plaintiff of liability.

140. D The majority of jurisdictions recognize a client's privilege to prevent
disclosure of a confidential communication that he or she made to his
or her attorney while seeking legal advice even before retaining him
or her. In addition, the privilege applies to confidences that the client
communicates  to  an  agent  of  the  attorney  in  connection  with  the
subject  of  the  attorney-client  relationship.  Since  the  plaintiff's
communication  with  the  witness  was  at  the  attorney's  request  to

1282

enable the attorney to make decisions relative to her representation of
the plaintiff, it is protected by the attorney-client privilege.

A document prepared by or for an attorney that contains the attorney's
mental impressions may be privileged as an attorney's work product.
A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  conversation  between  the
plaintiff and the witness was not a document and did not contain the
attorney's mental impressions. B is incorrect because there is no rule
of  privilege  that  protects  records  kept  in  the  course  of  business
simply  because  of  that  fact.  (Note:  Records  kept  in  the  course  of
business are sometimes admissible under an exception to the hearsay
rule.) An admission is a declaration by a party that is offered against
that  party.  Under  common  law,  admissions  are  admissible  hearsay;
under FRE 801(d)(2), 
admissions are not hearsay at all. Since the defendant seeks to offer
the plaintiff's statements against the plaintiff, they cannot be classified
as inadmissible hearsay. C is therefore incorrect.

141. B Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), the requirements for a class action are
numerosity,  common  questions  of  law  or  fact,  typicality  of  claim  or
defenses, and adequate representation. Here, there are 800 residents
who  are  all  being  forcibly  removed  from  their  homes  by  the  city,
which  is  apparently  doing  so  in  an  effort  to  combat  crime.  The  best
law firm in the city has taken the case, and the two named members
are  longtime  residents  and  business  owners.  Consequently,  it  seems
as if the four requirements are met. Importantly, an injunction can be
the basis of a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) so long as
“the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds
that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or
corresponding  declaratory  relief  is  appropriate  respecting  the  class
as  a  whole.”  Here,  an  injunction  to  stop  the  city's  plans  would  be
appropriate  respecting  the  class  as  a  whole.  Therefore,  C  is
incorrect.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  action  would  be  heard  in  federal  court
based the alleged violation of federal law, not based on diversity of
the parties. D is incorrect because 800 residents are likely too large a
group of people to make joinder feasible.

142. B Generally, if a tortfeasor negligently causes an injury, the tortfeasor is
liable for the full consequences of the injury even though a unique or
rare  medical  condition  causes  the  injury  to  be  much  worse  than  it

1283

would  have  been  for  an  ordinary  person.  Since  the  man's  negligent
flying  of  the  drone  knocked  over  the  woman,  the  fact  her  medical
condition caused blindness when the injury would not have done so in
an ordinary person does not relieve the man from liability. Therefore,
C and D are incorrect.

A is incorrect because the man's failure to register the drone had no
relation to his negligently hitting the woman with it. Negligence per se
only  applies  when  a  violation  of  a  law  leads  to  the  plaintiff  being
injured (i.e., speed limits).

143. B Ordinarily, a relevant object is admissible into evidence if a witness
testifies that he or she recognizes it. Because writings are particularly
subject  to  fraud,  however,  special  rules  have  developed  regarding
their  admission.  Where  the  legal  significance  of  a  writing  depends
upon  its  authorship,  the  writing  cannot  be  admitted  unless  the  court
(i.e., judge) finds that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding
regarding its authorship.

that 

the  court  determines

Unless 
authentication, the jury should not be given an opportunity to see the
document. A  is  therefore  incorrect.  FRE  901(b)(3)  and  the  common
law permit the jury to consider an authenticated exemplar of a party's
signature in determining whether a document in question was signed
by the party. C is incorrect, however, because this is not the only way
of getting the promissory note before the jury. D is incorrect because
once the court determines that there is sufficient evidence to justify a
finding  by  the  jury  regarding  the  genuineness  of  a  signature,  the
question of whether it actually is genuine is one of fact for the jury.

144. B A statute that establishes a system of classification that discriminates
against  members  of  a  particular  ethnic  group  may  violate  the  Equal
Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States
Constitution.  Even  if  a  statute  does  not  establish  such  a  system  of
classification,  however,  it  may  be  enforced  in  a  way  that  makes  it
unconstitutional as applied. In determining whether the application of
a  statute  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  the  United  States
Supreme  Court  has  examined  statistical  evidence  that  the  statute  is
being  enforced  in  a  discriminatory  manner.  Since  the  fact  that  100
percent of the officer's speeding tickets were issued to members of an
ethnic minority constituting only 10 percent of the population suggests
a  discriminatory  application  of  the  speed  limit  statute,  that  fact

1284

furnishes effective support for the plaintiff's assertion.

On  the  other  hand,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  has  received  such
summonses  only  from  the  officer  does  not  indicate  a  discriminatory
application  of  the  statute  by  the  officer  unless  it  is  coupled  with
information  about  other  summonses  issued  by  the  officer.  A  is
incorrect for this reason and because three incidents are probably not
enough to justify any generalization. Coupled with the facts in option
B,  the  facts  in  option  C  might  support  the  conclusion  that
discrimination  was  behind  the  apparent  inequity  in  the  officer's
issuing  of  speeding  tickets.  Standing  alone,  however,  the  fact  that
members of the plaintiff's minority do not drive any differently from
members of other groups does nothing to show that the summons was
issued  to  the  plaintiff  on  a  discriminatory  basis.  C  is  therefore
incorrect. It is, of course, physically impossible for a police officer to
apprehend all violators of a particular statute. This means that some
will be apprehended, while others will not. For this reason, the fact
that one member of a particular ethnic group was apprehended while
some  persons  who  did  not  belong  to  that  ethnic  group  were  not
apprehended is not in itself sufficient to indicate that the apprehension
of  the  plaintiff  was  the  result  of  discrimination.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

145.  A  Criminal  battery  consists  of  the  intentional,  reckless,  or  criminally
negligent application of force to the body of another person. One who
knows  that  he  or  she  often  becomes  intoxicated  upon  drinking  small
quantities  of  alcoholic  beverages  may  be  guilty  of  recklessness  or
criminal negligence by drinking half a glass of beer in the company of
other  people.  Since  this  is  all  the  mens  rea  required  for  a  battery
conviction,  the  fact  that  it  was  the  alcohol  that  made  the  defendant
become  violent  would  not  be  relevant  to  any  material  issue  in  the
case. For this reason, the psychiatrist's testimony should be excluded.

The psychiatrist's testimony had no bearing on the defendant's sanity
under  any  definition  of  that  term  currently  applied  in  the  United
States,  but  it  might  be  admissible  for  some  other  reason.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  criminal  battery  may  be
committed  recklessly  or  criminally  negligently  without  the  intent  to
injure (i.e., criminal battery is a general-intent crime). A defendant's
intoxication  is  involuntary  if  the  intoxicant  was  taken  against  his  or
her will or without knowledge of its intoxicating properties. Since the

1285

defendant  was  aware  that  even  a  small  quantity  of  alcohol  could
intoxicate  him,  he  cannot  be  said  to  have  become  intoxicated
involuntarily. The psychiatrist's testimony would simply confirm what
the defendant already knew about himself when he drank the beer, and
therefore it could not establish that the intoxication was involuntary.
D is therefore incorrect.

146. B  To  be  enforceable,  a  contract  must  be  definite  and  certain  in  all  its
basic terms. One way of determining whether a purported agreement
is sufficiently definite and certain is to ask whether its terms make it
possible  for  a  court  to  fashion  a  remedy  for  its  breach.  Most  of  the
time,  this  requires  that  the  agreement  identify  the  parties  and  show
that they have agreed to the subject matter, the time for performance,
and the price. The writing between the buyer and the seller leaves the
price  to  be  determined  by  a  later  agreement.  But  if  the  parties  have
not agreed as to how that subsequently-to-be-agreed-on price shall be
determined, there is no way that a court could fashion a remedy for its
breach.  The  writing  would  thus  fail  because  it  is  not  sufficiently
definite and certain.

The Statute of Frauds requires that an agreement to transfer an interest
in  real  estate  be  in  writing.  A  writing  might  satisfy  its  requirements
even  though  it  does  not  specify  a  price,  so  long  as  it  indicates  the
method  that  the  parties  have  agreed  to  use  in  setting  the  price.  For
example, if the parties have agreed to set “a reasonable price” in the
future,  the  writing  might  satisfy  the  Statute  of  Frauds  even  though  it
does not specify what the price will be. A is therefore incorrect. C is
incorrect  because  the  parties  did  not  agree  to  be  bound  by  the
objective value of the property, even if it could be determined. D is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  UCC  provision  that  deems  an
omitted  price  term  to  call  for  a  reasonable  price  applies  only  to
transactions in goods, and second, this contract did not omit the price
term  but  provided  that  it  would  be  set  by  mutual  agreement  in  the
future.

147. D A person is guilty of an attempt when, with the intent to bring about a
result  that  is  criminally  prohibited,  he  or  she  commits  some  act  that
brings  him  or  her  substantially  close  to  accomplishing  that  result.  If
the result that the defendant intended is criminally prohibited, and if
the  defendant  came  substantially  close  to  accomplishing  it,  she  is
guilty of attempting it. If an exam answer is “information” as defined

1286

by the statute, its theft would be a crime whether the defendant knew
it or not. Similarly, if she intended to steal it and came substantially
close to doing so, she is guilty of an attempt to violate the statute even
though  she  did  not  know  that  what  she  was  attempting  to  do  was  a
crime.

A person may be guilty of attempting to commit a crime even though
facts unknown to him or her would have made successful completion
of  the  crime  impossible.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  As  a  matter  of
policy, all persons are irrebuttably presumed to know the law. Thus, a
defense  cannot  be  based  on  the  defendant's  ignorance  of  the  statute
that  prohibits  his  or  her  conduct  (i.e.,  ignorance  of  the  law  is  no
excuse). B is therefore incorrect. Since criminal attempt requires the
intent  to  bring  about  a  result  that  is  criminally  prohibited,  a  person
cannot be guilty simply because the result that he or she intended to
achieve was immoral. C is therefore incorrect.

148. B Battery  is  the  intentional  infliction  of  a  harmful  or  offensive  bodily
contact.  However,  consent  is  a  complete  defense  to  battery,  and  a
plaintiff's consent can be implied by the plaintiff's actions. Here, by
taking  part  in  the  soccer  game,  the  plaintiff  impliedly  consented  to
having  the  ball  kicked  away  from  him  (a  common  occurrence  in  the
game). While the defense of consent can be lost if the defendant goes
beyond the consented-to level of contact, the defendant's actions here
do not seem to rise to that level (e.g., if he had punched the plaintiff
or intentionally kicked him directly in the leg). A is incorrect because
assumption of the risk is a defense in negligence actions that generally
applies in clearly dangerous situations where the plaintiff voluntarily
takes  his  or  her  chances  that  a  particular  harm  will  occur  (e.g.,  sky
diving). C is incorrect, because a defendant does not need to intend to
injure the plaintiff, so long as he or she intends to cause a harmful or
offensive  contact.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  contact  here  was  truly
“harmful”  in  that  it  injured  the  plaintiff.  “Offensive  to  a  reasonable
sense of dignity” involves situations where the plaintiff is not actually
harmed by the contact.

149. D  The  right  of  survivorship  is  the  best  known  characteristic  of  a  joint
tenancy.  It  means  that  if  one  of  the  joint  tenants  dies,  the  survivor
becomes the owner of the deceased tenant's share. Thus, if the brother
died while he and his sister were joint tenants, the sister would have
become the sole owner of the realty. When a joint tenant conveys his

1287

or her interest, however, the joint tenancy is severed, and his or her
grantee  becomes  a  tenant  in  common  with  the  remaining  co-owner.
Tenants  in  common  do  not  have  a  right  of  survivorship.  Since  a
quitclaim deed conveys the grantor's interest, the brother's quitclaim
to his wife severed his joint tenancy with his sister and made his wife
and his sister tenants in common. When the sister died, her daughter
inherited the sister's interest, thus becoming a tenant in common with
the wife.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  for  the  reasons  given  above.  C  is  incorrect
because  the  brother's  quitclaim  deed  to  his  wife  severed  the  joint
tenancy.

150. A  Article  IV,  Section  2,  paragraph  2  of  the  United  States  Constitution
contains what is known as the Property Clause: “Congress shall have
power  to  dispose  of  and  make  all  needful  rules  and  regulations
respecting  .  .  .  property  belonging  to  the  United  States.”  The  United
States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  the  Property  Clause  leaves  the
lease or other disposition of federal property within the discretion of
Congress.

Although the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate
interstate commerce, B is incorrect because there is no fact indicating
that the lease of grazing land was for that purpose or would have that
effect. A person has standing to assert a constitutional challenge if he
or she is faced with some actual or immediately threatened concrete
harm that the court could avoid by granting the relief requested. If the
low rate will cause the plaintiff to lose revenue, the plaintiff faces an
immediately  threatened  concrete  harm.  If  the  court  declares  the
federal  lease  unconstitutional,  the  problems  created  by  competition
with  the  federal  government  will  be  solved,  and  the  harm  will  be
averted.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  This  proceeding  challenges  the
constitutionality of the action of Congress and the agency to which it
delegated  power.  The  authority  of  Congress  and  the  federal
government  is  limited  by  the  Constitution.  If  the  federal  government
were immune from such a challenge, constitutional limitations on its
exercise  of  power  would  be  meaningless.  Whether  the  federal
government is immune from tort claims based on allegations of unfair
competition is irrelevant. D is therefore incorrect.

151. A Under the Restatement approach, whether the breeder could rescind
the contract would depend on whether the characteristic on which the

1288

parties were mistaken was a “basic assumption.” Here, the belief of
the  parties  that  the  cow  was  barren,  and  the  huge  price  difference
between a barren and breeding cow, shows that the characteristic was
a basic assumption of the contract. B is incorrect because that answer
choice  only  mentions  the  price  difference,  and  does  not  take  into
account  whether  it  was  a  basic  assumption  of  the  contract.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  mistake  concerned  a  basic  assumption  of  the
contract, not merely the price. D is incorrect for the same reason.

152. C  The  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  provides  in
part that “No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be
a  witness  against  himself.”  The  privilege  only  prohibits  the
government from requiring a testimonial communication, however. It
does  not  protect  a  person  against  being  required  to  participate  in
identification procedures that might lead to his or her conviction. For
this  reason,  the  Fifth  Amendment  privilege  does  not  protect  the
defendant against being required to walk across the courtroom.

required 

to  utter 

A defendant who testifies in his or her own behalf thereby waives the
privilege  and  may  even  be 
testimonial
communications  that  might  tend  to  incriminate  him  or  her.  Since  the
include  non-testimonial
Fifth  Amendment  privilege  does  not 
communications, however, the question of waiver is irrelevant. A is
therefore  incorrect.  A  prosecutor  may  not  comment  on  a  defendant's
assertion  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  privilege;  the  jury  may  not  draw
inferences  from  it.  B  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  Fifth
Amendment does not privilege the defendant to refuse to walk across
the courtroom. Since no penalty can be imposed for the assertion of a
constitutional 
right,  and  since  a  criminal  defendant  has  a
constitutional  right  to  be  present  at  his  or  her  own  trial,  the
defendant's presence in the courtroom cannot be a waiver of any other
right. D is therefore incorrect.

153. A The United States Supreme Court has held that because manipulation
of  circumstances  surrounding  a  lineup  could  create  considerable
likelihood of inaccuracy, and because it would be difficult at trial to
fully  develop  evidence  regarding  such  manipulation,  the  Sixth
Amendment  requires  the  presence  of  counsel  at  a  post-indictment
lineup. For this reason, the defendant's objection would probably be
sustained for the reason given in A.

The constitutional right to confront witnesses requires that a defendant

1289

be given an opportunity to cross-examine such witnesses at a trial. It
does not require, however, that the defendant be given an opportunity
to question those witnesses at any other stage of the proceeding (i.e.,
at a lineup). B is therefore incorrect. The Fifth Amendment protection
against self-incrimination applies only to testimonial communication.
For this reason, it does not prohibit compelling a defendant to show
himself  or  herself  to  witnesses  for  identification  purposes.  C  is
therefore  incorrect.  Since  a  defendant  has  no  constitutional  right  to
refuse to appear in a lineup, police may compel or coerce him or her
to  do  so  by  the  use  or  threat  of  reasonable  force.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

154.  C  A  negligent  defendant  is  liable  for  additional  damage  caused  by
foreseeable rescue efforts. This is true even if these rescue efforts are
negligent in themselves. When faced with a severally injured person,
it is foreseeable that an ambulance driver would drive faster than the
speed limit and negligently crash into a pole. Consequently, the man is
also liable for his friend's death in the ambulance accident.

A is incorrect because a foreseeable rescue does not break the chain
of  liability.  B  is  incorrect  because  it  was  foreseeable  that  the
ambulance  might  drive  negligently  and  crash  into  a  pole.  D  is
incorrect because the simple fact the death happened after the friend's
injuries  would  not  make  the  man  liable  for  the  friend's  death.
Importantly, there is no connection between the accident injuries and
the actual death.

155. B Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must
vest if at all within a period measured by a life or lives in being plus
21  years.  Thus,  a  future  interest  that  might  never  vest  at  all  is  valid
under the Rule so long as the language that created it will prevent it
from vesting after the prescribed period (i.e., if it vests, it will do so
during  the  prescribed  period).  Since  the  church  might  never  cease
using  the  land  for  church  purposes,  and  since,  even  if  it  did,  the
hospital might never cease using the land for hospital purposes, it is
possible  that  the  son's  interest  as  created  by  the  landowner's  deed
will never vest at all. The language of the landowner's deed provides,
however, that in no event is the interest of the son to vest unless the
son is alive when the conditions precedent are satisfied. Thus, since
the interest of the son must vest if at all during a period measured by a
life in being (i.e., the son's life), it does not violate the Rule Against

1290

Perpetuities.

Many  jurisdictions  recognize  an  exception  to  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities  for  the  interest  of  a  charitable  organization  that  follows
the  interest  of  another  charitable  organization.  The  son  is  not  a
charitable organization, however, so this exception would not prevent
the Rule Against Perpetuities from applying to the son's interest. A is
therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities  does  not  require  that  the  interest  in  question  will  vest
during  the  prescribed  period,  but  that  if  it  vests  at  all,  it  will  be
during  that  period.  In  a  jurisdiction  that  does  not  recognize  an
exception  for  the  interest  of  a  charity  that  follows  the  interest  of
another  charity,  the  hospital's  interest  would  be  void  under  the  Rule
Against  Perpetuities.  This  is  because  the  condition  that  would  make
its  interest  vest  (i.e.,  cessation  of  use  for  church  purposes)  might
occur after the period established by the rule. Since the landowner's
deed provides that the interest of the son cannot vest unless it does so
during the life of the son, however, the interest of the son would not
violate the Rule even if the interest of the hospital did. D is therefore
incorrect.

156. D Although the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (applied to
state  action  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment)  prohibits  the  arbitrary
regulation of economic interests, it is almost never used to justify the
conclusion that an economic regulation is unconstitutional. In general,
so  long  as  such  a  regulation  employs  a  means  reasonably  related  to
accomplishing a purpose within the scope of a state's general police
power and does not amount to a “taking,” it will be regarded as valid
under  the  Due  Process  Clause.  Since  regulating  the  storage  of
radioactive  wastes  is  reasonably  related  to  the  legitimate  police
power objective of protecting the public good, and since there is no
indication that Section 40 drastically interferes with the operation of
out-of-state  power  plants,  the  Section  does  not  violate  the  Due
Process Clauses. Although it is not certain that Section 40 would be
declared unconstitutional, due process is the only argument listed that
could not possibly result in such a declaration.

The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV prohibits a state
from  arbitrarily  discriminating  against  out-of-staters.  Since  Section
40  effectively  denies  the  use  of  state  storage  facilities  to  out-of-
staters,  it  might  violate  this  clause.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The

1291

Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment
prohibits  a  state  from  interfering  with  any  of  the  rights  that  go  with
United  States  citizenship.  One  of  these  is  the  right  to  travel  freely
from  state  to  state.  Since  the  Section  effectively  prevents  the
importation  of  radioactive  wastes  from  outside  the  state,  it  may  be
unconstitutional  because  it  interferes  with  this  freedom.  For  this
reason,  B  is  incorrect.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits
invidious  discrimination  by  a  state.  Since  Section  40  effectively
disqualifies  out-of-state  producers  of  radioactive  waste  from  using
facilities  available  to  in-state  producers,  it  discriminates  against
them.

157. B The United States Supreme Court has upheld a state court's personal
jurisdiction over a defendant when the defendant is personally served
with  process  while  he  or  she  is  within  the  state's  borders.  See
Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604 (1990). This is true even if
the defendant is only in the state for a short time. Therefore, C and D
are incorrect.

A is  incorrect  because  the  fact  the  action  was  filed  in  state  court  in
State  B  would  not  automatically  confer  personal  jurisdiction  over  a
defendant.

158.  D  In  general,  all  evidence  is  admissible  if  it  is  relevant  to  a  fact  of
consequence in the litigation. The fact that there were stolen license
plates on the defendant's van tends to establish that he was attempting
to  avoid  recognition,  and  therefore  that  he  was  planning  to  commit
some crime. Since the burglary statute requires an intent to commit a
crime inside the entered premises, the defendant's plan is relevant to a
fact  of  consequence.  For  this  reason,  evidence  of  the  stolen  license
plates may be admissible in the burglary prosecution.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  It  is  generally  understood  that  evidence  of
unconvicted bad acts by a defendant is inadmissible for the purpose
of establishing that he or she had a criminal disposition. Where such
evidence is offered not merely to prove that defendant had a criminal
disposition,  however,  but  to  establish  an  inference  that  he  or  she
committed the act charged, it may be admissible. Here, evidence that
the  defendant  made  special  preparations  for  a  crime  justifies  the
inference that he entered the warehouse to commit a crime therein. B
is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because evidence of unconvicted

1292

acts  is  inadmissible  for  the  purpose  of  establishing  a  criminal
disposition.

159. A Generally, in the absence of an agreement by the promisee to release
the  promisor  from  his  or  her  obligations  under  a  contract,  the
promisor  continues  to  be  bound  by  his  or  her  promise  even  after
assigning his or her rights. Thus, any rights that the seller had against
the  buyer  under  the  contract  of  sale  survived  the  assignment  by  the
buyer  to  the  attorney.  Even  in  the  absence  of  a  specific  provision
requiring it, a contract for the sale of real property is understood to
impose upon the seller an obligation to deliver marketable title. But
the seller satisfies this obligation if his or her title is marketable at the
time set for performance (i.e., the closing). Since the seller acquired
title  to  the  land  prior  to  the  closing,  he  is  entitled  to  enforce  the
contract of sale against the buyer.

The doctrine of estoppel by deed provides that when a seller acquires
title to realty that he or she has already purported to grant to another
person, he or she acquires it on behalf of that grantee and is estopped
from  denying  the  validity  of  his  or  her  previous  conveyance.  It  is
inapplicable to this case because the seller obtained title to the land
before attempting to convey it to the buyer. B is therefore incorrect. C
is incorrect because the contract did not require the seller to deliver
marketable title until July 15, and on that date he did hold marketable
title. An interest is said to be outside the chain of title if it could not
have been discovered by a reasonable title searcher. Sometimes this
occurs  when  a  person  claims  to  have  received  an  interest  from  a
grantor after a transfer of that same interest by the same grantor had
previously  been  recorded.  (For  example,  O  transfers  to  A.  O  then
transfers  to  B.  B  records  before  A.  A's  interest  may  be  outside  the
chain of title, because a reasonable title searcher finding O's transfer
to B in the record would not look for any subsequent transfers of the
same interest by O.) D is incorrect, however, for two reasons: First,
this argument is normally relevant only in determining the priority of
two  different  interests,  and  second,  there  is  no  indication  that  the
farmer  had  previously  conveyed  the  land  to  another  person  or  that
such a conveyance had been recorded before the farmer's conveyance
to the seller.

160. A An action must be dismissed if the federal court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over the action. For a federal court to have subject
matter jurisdiction over an action, the plaintiff and defendant must be

1293

citizens of different states or the action must arise under federal law.
Here,  the  businessman  is  a  citizen  of  State  A.  A  corporation  is  a
citizen  of  where  it  is  incorporated  and  where  its  principal  place  of
business  is  located.  A  corporation's  principal  place  of  business  is
where  the  corporation's  high-level  officers  control  the  business.
Consequently,  the  company  is  a  citizen  of  State  B,  where  it  is
incorporated,  and  State  A,  where  its  executives  are  based.  Because
both  the  businessman  and  the  company  are  citizens  of  State  A,  the
action should be dismissed.

B is incorrect because the issue presented here is not one regarding
personal  jurisdiction,  and  the  location  of  the  majority  of  the
company's  apartments  does  not  affect  its  citizenship  in  regards  to
determining  subject  matter  jurisdiction.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
appeals  court  would  be  required  to  dismiss  the  action  for  lack  of
subject  matter  jurisdiction  even  if  the  company  did  not  challenge
jurisdiction.  D  is  incorrect  because  federal  question  jurisdiction
cannot be based on a defendant's defense.

161. B Police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only
if  the  arrestee  is  within  reaching  distance  of  the  passenger
compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the
vehicle  contains  evidence  of  the  offense  of  arrest.  When  these
justifications  are  absent,  a  search  of  an  arrestee's  vehicle  will  be
unreasonable  unless  police  obtain  a  warrant  or  show  that  another
exception to the warrant requirement applies. Here, the defendant was
secured  in  the  police  car  at  the  time  of  the  search,  and  there  is
unlikely  to  be  any  evidence  relating  to  his  offense.  While  searches
conducted without prior approval are unlawful, this statement is too
broad because it fails to note the exceptions to this rule. A is therefore
incorrect. C is incorrect because an inventory search is not the only
way  a  police  officer  can  lawfully  discover  evidence  contained  in  a
car. D is incorrect because there is no rule stating that the interior of a
car is always within the immediate control of an arrestee.

162. A Generally, the federal rules only require that a complaint contain “a
short  and  plain  statement  of  the  claim  showing  that  the  pleader  is
entitled to relief.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9,
certain  other  matters,  such  as  fraud,  mistake,  and  special  damages
require  a  party  to  give  more  detail.  Here,  since  the  man  is  simply
making a claim under federal employment law, he does not need to do

1294

more than make a short and plain statement of the claim.

B is incorrect because the relevant analysis requires more than mere
notice. For example, a plaintiff could not simply file a complaint that
stated “I'm suing defendant!” In that case, while the defendant would
certainly  have  notice,  the  defendant  would  know  nothing  about  the
claim. C is incorrect because the salesman does not need to set out a
prima facie case. D is incorrect because “a party may state as many
separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.” See
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3).

163. D A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to  bring  about  a  criminally  prohibited  result,  he  or  she  does  some
significant  act  that  brings  him  or  her  substantially  close  to
accomplishing  that  result.  Thus,  although  a  person  may  be  guilty  of
murder  without  actually  intending  to  bring  about  a  death,  he  or  she
cannot be guilty of attempted murder without the intent to bring about
a death. Since the druggist did not really believe that the wife would
die, he could not have intended to bring about her death and cannot be
guilty of attempting to murder her.

Murder  is  the  unlawful  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought.  Malice  aforethought  includes  a  reckless  disregard  for
human life. If the druggist's conduct showed a reckless disregard for
human life, and if it resulted in the death of the wife, then the druggist
would  be  guilty  of  murder.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  no
person can be guilty of attempted murder without the specific intent to
bring about a death or to cause great bodily harm. B is incorrect for
the same reason, and because ordinarily a person is under no duty to
stop  another  from  committing  a  crime.  Since  the  druggist  did  not
believe the drug that he furnished would harm the wife, he lacked the
specific intent necessary to make him guilty of attempting to kill her.
C is therefore incorrect.

164. A  Under  FRE  803(8),  the  file  itself  may  be  admissible  as  an  official
written statement since it was made at or near the time of the matter
recorded  by  a  public  official  regarding  matters  in  the  declarant's
personal  knowledge  in  the  course  of  the  declarant's  duties.  (Note:
The  file  may  also  be  admissible  as  a  business  record.)  Even  if  the
personnel  file's  contents  are  admissible,  however,  the  witness's
testimony about its contents might not be. Under the common law and
FRE  1002,  the  best  evidence  rule  prohibits  secondary  evidence  to

1295

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

prove the terms of a writing unless the writing itself is shown to be
unavailable. Since the purpose of the witness's testimony is to prove
the  contents  of  the  file,  he  will  not  be  permitted  to  do  so  unless  the
file is shown to be unavailable.

If  the  requirements  of  the  best  evidence  rule  are  satisfied,  the
witness's  testimony  would  be  as  admissible  as  the  file  itself.  Since
the  FRE  make  business  records  and  official  written  statements
admissible without regard to the availability of the person who made
entries  in  them,  B  and  C  are  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
official  written  statement  exception,  although  it  is  sometimes  called
the “public document” exception, does not require that the record be
one that is available for public inspection.

165. A  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  something  of  value
(i.e.,  consideration)  was  given  in  return  for  it.  Since  the  plaintiff
paved the driveway before the neighbor promised to pay, he could not
have  done  so  in  return  for  the  promise.  The  paving  job,  therefore,
could not have been consideration for the neighbor's promise. Under
the  view  of  the  Restatement  (2d)  of  Contracts,  however,  a  promise
made in recognition of a benefit previously received by the promisor
from  the  promisee  is  binding  to  the  extent  necessary  to  prevent
injustice.  Thus,  if  the  neighbor  knew  that  the  plaintiff  had  paved  his
driveway and made the promise to pay in recognition of this benefit,
the promise would be enforceable.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  neighbor's  promise  could  not  have  been
given  in  recognition  of  the  paving  job  if  the  neighbor  did  not  know
about it at the time he made the promise. Since the paving job done by
the  plaintiff  was  not  given  in  return  for  the  neighbor's  promise,  it
would  not  be  consideration  for  that  promise  no  matter  when  the
neighbor  decided  to  have  the  job  done.  C  and  D  are  therefore
incorrect.

166. D A landlord's failure to take prompt action when he or she learns of an
attempted assignment or sublease constitutes a waiver of the right to
block  it.  Here,  the  landlord  will  probably  not  be  permitted  to
terminate  the  lease  since  he  likely  waived  his  right  to  do  so  by
accepting rent and failing to take prompt action when he discovered
the assignment. Consequently, A is incorrect. B is incorrect because,
by accepting rent and waiting to protest, the landlord did not appear
to be protesting within a reasonable time. C is incorrect because the

1296

issue  involves  the  landlord's  actions,  not  the  nature  of  the  property
interests.

167. D If a person's behavior is grossly negligent, he or she may be liable for
involuntary manslaughter if his or her conduct results in the death of
another person. Nearly all states hold that the defendant's negligence
must be something more than ordinary negligence. “Gross negligence”
usually  means  the  defendant  disregarded  a  substantial  danger  of
serious  bodily  harm  or  death.  However,  there  must  be  a  causal  link
between the gross negligence and the death. Consequently, if the death
would  have  occurred  even  without  the  defendant's  gross  negligence,
involuntary manslaughter wouldn't apply. Here, the facts state that the
defendant drove the correct speed and obeyed all traffic regulations.
Consequently, his gross negligence, specifically his intoxication, was
not the cause in fact or proximate cause of the man's death. Thus, A is
incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because,  even  though  courts  look  at  the
totality  of  the  circumstances  in  determining  gross  negligence,  the
important  point  is  that  the  defendant's  gross  negligence  was  not  the
cause  of  the  accident.  C  is  incorrect  because,  even  if  a  violation  is
malum  in  se  (dangerous  in  itself),  there  still  needs  to  be  a  causal
relation between the negligence and the death.

168.  A  An  illusory  promise  is  a  statement  which  appears  to  promise
something,  but  in  fact  does  not  commit  the  promisor  to  anything.
Importantly,  such  a  promise  will  not  give  sufficient  consideration  to
support  a  contract.  Here,  there  was  no  consideration  for  the
endorsement because the plaintiff could have sued immediately if he
decided  he  wanted  his  money.  Thus,  he  really  didn't  promise  to  do
anything at all. The fact that the plaintiff in fact did not collect on the
note  for  two  years  is  irrelevant.  Under  promissory  estoppel,  a
promise is binding if “. . . (c) the promisor should reasonably expect
the promise to induce action or forbearance of a substantial character
on  the  part  of  a  promisee  or  a  third  person,  and  the  promise  does
induce such action or forbearance.” Here, a court might find that the
defendant's guarantee should reasonably have been expected to induce
the plaintiff to refrain from suing, that it did have this effect, and that
this  was  of  a  substantial  character.  In  such  an  event,  the  defendant
would have been bound. Based on the facts here, a court could find
that the plaintiff did in fact rely to his detriment on the promise. Thus,
B is incorrect, and A is a stronger answer. C is incorrect because the
fact  that  the  husband  is  the  primary  debtor  does  not  change  the

1297

analysis. Unconscionability arises in situations where an agreement is
grossly  unfair.  Here,  there  is  no  indication  of  any  unfairness  in  the
agreement, so D is incorrect.

169. A Specific performance is a remedy available for breach of a contract
for  the  sale  of  something  unique.  Since  each  parcel  of  realty  is
regarded  as  unique,  specific  performance  is  usually  available  as  a
buyer's remedy for a seller's breach of a contract for the sale of realty.
Unless  such  a  contract  has  been  formed  and  breached,  however,  no
remedy is available at all. A contract is formed by the acceptance of
an  offer.  An  offer  is  an  expression  of  an  unequivocal  willingness  to
enter into a contract with another on specified terms. Since the seller
never indicated a willingness to enter into a contract with the buyer
on  any  particular  terms,  he  never  made  an  offer  to  the  buyer.  The
buyer  twice  made  offers  to  the  seller,  but  the  seller  did  not  accept
either of them. Thus, no contract was ever formed between the seller
and  the  buyer  or  breached  by  the  seller.  The  buyer  is  therefore
without any remedy.

Whether  the  seller's  statement  to  the  broker  on  April  10  was  an
attempt to modify an existing agreement is not at all certain under the
facts regarding that agreement. B is incorrect in any event because the
agreement between the seller and the broker did not require the seller
to accept an offer procured by the broker, and it is not relevant to the
buyer's  rights  against  the  seller.  Specific  performance  is  not  usually
available as a remedy for the breach of a contract for sale unless the
subject of the contract is unique or damages would be an inadequate
remedy.  C  is  incorrect,  however,  because  —  for  the  reasons  given
above  —  there  has  been  no  breach,  and  the  buyer  therefore  has  no
remedy  at  all.  Since  the  seller  made  no  offer  to  the  buyer,  the
document  that  was  presented  to  the  seller  on  April  14  was  nothing
more  than  an  offer.  Since  the  seller  did  not  accept  it,  no  contract
between him and the buyer was formed. D is therefore incorrect.

170.  C  Hearsay  is  defined  as  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  for  the
purpose  of  proving  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  that  statement.
Since the plaintiff's attorney's notes were made out of court, and since
the only apparent reason to offer them is to establish the truth of their
contents, they are hearsay.

FRE  803(6) 
for  properly
recognizes  a  hearsay  exception 
authenticated business records recorded as part of the regular course

1298

of business, while the transaction recorded was fresh in the entrant's
mind, regarding facts within the entrant's personal knowledge or from
an  inherently  reliable  source.  Since  the  facts  do  not  indicate  what
information was contained in the attorney's notes, there is no way to
determine whether all the information actually contained in them was
within  the  attorney's  personal  knowledge  or  from  an  inherently
reliable  source.  An  additional  question  exists  as  to  whether  an
attorney's notes regarding a negotiation between a client and another
party are kept in the regular course of business. No matter how these
questions  are  resolved,  however,  the  attorney's  notes  cannot  be
admitted  as  a  business  record  unless  they  are  authenticated  by  a
person  who  testifies  to  the  record's  identity  and  its  mode  of
preparation.  Since  no  one  has  testified  as  such,  A  is  incorrect.
Documents  that  have  been  used  to  refresh  a  witness's  recollection
while  testifying  may  be  consulted  by  an  adverse  party  in  cross-
examining  that  witness.  In  addition,  an  adverse  party  may  introduce
into evidence those portions of the document that are relevant to the
witness's testimony. B  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  fact  that  a
party  used  a  document  to  refresh  his  or  her  recollection  is  not
sufficient  to  justify  its  introduction  by  the  party  that  used  it.  Under
certain circumstances, an attorney may resist discovery of his or her
own  work  product  and  prevent  it  from  being  received  in  evidence.
This  privilege  belongs  to  the  attorney  (and  his  or  her  client),
however, not to his or her adversary. For this reason, the defendant's
attorney could not successfully object on the ground that the document
was the plaintiff's attorney's work product. D is therefore incorrect.

171. D The Equal Protection Clause prohibits invidious discrimination by the
state,  but  not  all  discrimination  is  invidious.  Ordinarily,  statutory
systems  of  classification  (i.e.,  discrimination)  are  valid  so  long  as
they have a rational basis. If the discrimination is based on a suspect
classification  or  interferes  with  a  fundamental  right,  however,  it  is
presumed  invalid  unless  it  is  proven  to  be  necessary  to  achieve  a
compelling state interest. The Supreme Court has held that the right to
vote  is  a  fundamental  right.  For  this  reason,  the  Township  Council's
assertion that the registration schedule had a rational basis would not
be sufficient to prevent it from being declared unconstitutional.

Discrimination on the basis of lifestyle or wealth has been held not to
involve  a  suspect  classification.  A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.
Some  forms  of  sex  discrimination,  referred  to  as  “benign”  because

1299

they  are  aimed  at  compensating  for  the  demonstrated  economic
disadvantages of women, have been found constitutional. Some forms

172. C Unless a landlord specifically agrees to release a tenant from further
obligations under a lease, assignment or sublease does not relieve the
original  tenant  from  those  obligations.  For  this  reason,  the  landlord
can collect unpaid rent from the first attorney. Since the landlord was
an intended third-party creditor beneficiary of the agreement between
the attorneys, the landlord can also collect from the second attorney.
A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

173. C Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(d), a district court can order a new trial on
its  own  for  any  reason  that  would  justify  granting  one  on  a  party's
motion.  Because  inadequate  damages  could  be  the  basis  for  a  new
trial, the trial judge can order a new trial.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  additur,  or  offering  a  defendant  a
choice between a higher damage award or a new trial, had been found
to  be  a  violation  of  the  Seventh  Amendment  (although  this  does  not
apply to state courts). D is incorrect because a motion for judgment as
a matter of law must be made by a party before the case is submitted
to a jury.

174.  A  Unless  the  parties  expressly  agree  otherwise,  the  owner  of  the
servient estate is not required to repair or maintain the property used
in  the  easement.  Here,  there  was  no  express  agreement  regarding
repair  between  the  parties,  so  the  owner  who  granted  the  easement
has no duty to repair the bridge. B is incorrect, because, although the
holder of the easement has an implied right to maintain the property
used in the easement, if the servient estate holder does not enjoy any
of the benefits of the easement, he is under no obligation to reimburse
for  repairs.  Here,  there  is  no  indication  that  the  owner  who  granted
the easement uses the easement. C is incorrect because the owner of
the  servient  estate  has  no  obligation  of  repair,  even  if  the  lack  of
maintenance means that the easement holder cannot use the easement
as the parties intended. D is incorrect because the fact that this was an
express easement does not change the analysis.

1300

175. B State action that imposes a penalty for the exercise of a constitutional
right  is  a  deprivation  of  liberty.  If  the  decision  not  to  renew  the
plaintiff's  contract  was  based  on  his  speech  (an  exercise  of  First
Amendment rights), it interfered with a liberty interest. Since the Fifth
and  Fourteenth  Amendments  protect  against  deprivation  of  liberty
without due process, the additional fact set forth in B could result in a
finding that a hearing (i.e., due process) was required.

A is incorrect because there is no indication that the contracts of the
probationary  employees  who  received  hearings  permitted  non-
renewal  without  cause,  as  did  the  plaintiff's.  C  is  incorrect  because
the United States Supreme Court has specifically held that state action
does  not  require  a  prior  hearing  merely  because  it  interferes  with
reputation, particularly since a tort action for defamation is available
to  prevent  abuse.  Sometimes  urgency  plays  a  role  in  the  court's
decision  about  whether  a  prior  hearing  is  required  for  a  particular
action.  For  example,  it  has  been  held  that  because  the  denial  of
welfare  benefits  could  leave  a  person  in  a  desperate  financial
situation, a prior hearing is required. Similarly, if delaying governing
action until after a hearing is held is likely to result in serious harm to
the government, it might be appropriate to act without holding a prior
hearing.  The  fact  set  forth  in  D  might  justify  the  conclusion  that
keeping the plaintiff on the job until a hearing is held would result in
serious harm to the state. In that case, it would hurt rather than help
the plaintiff's cause.

176. A In jurisdictions that recognize the spousal privilege, a spouse is not
permitted  to  testify  to  a  confidential  communication  received  during
marriage  if  the  spouse  who  made  the  communication  objects  to  the
testimony.  For  this  reason,  the  court  should  exclude  his  wife's
testimony if the defendant objects to it.

In  general,  all  evidence  that  tends  to  establish  a  material  fact  is
relevant and should be admitted unless excluded by some rule of law.
Since  the  defendant's  statement  that  he  committed  the  crimes  he  is
charged with tends to establish that he did so, it is relevant. Hearsay
is  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  matter
asserted in that statement and is inadmissible unless it falls within an
exception to the hearsay rule. A statement by a party offered against
that  party  is  an  admission,  however.  An  admission  is  admissible
under  common  law  as  an  exception  to  the  hearsay  rule  and  is  not

1301

hearsay under FRE 801(d)(2). Thus, the defendant's statement should
be  admitted  unless  excluded  by  the  spousal  privilege.  A  privilege
may only be asserted by one who holds it. In some jurisdictions (and
the FRE follow local state law as to privileges), the spousal privilege
can  be  asserted  only  by  the  spouse  who  made  the  confidential
communication.  In  other  jurisdictions,  the  privilege  may  also  be
asserted  by  the  spouse  who  received  the  communication.  But  all
jurisdictions agree that the communication may be excluded only if a
person  holding  it  objects.  Therefore,  if  neither  spouse  asserts  the
privilege, it cannot be used to exclude the wife's testimony. B, C, and
D are therefore incorrect.

177. A A party's unequivocal statement that he or she will not perform is an
anticipatory  repudiation  and  entitles  the  other  party  to  all  rights
resulting  from  a  breach.  The  plaintiff's  statement  that  she  would  not
accept the coins in payment for the chickens was such a statement. Its
result was to free the defendant from any further obligation under the
contract  and  to  give  the  defendant  a  right  to  an  immediate  action
against the plaintiff for breach of contract.

A  prospective  inability  to  perform  occurs  when  a  party  engages  in
some  conduct  that  divests  that  party  of  the  ability  to  perform.  All
jurisdictions  agree  that  one  party's  prospective  inability  to  perform
excuses  the  other  party's  performance,  and  some  jurisdictions  hold
that  it  gives  him  or  her  an  immediate  right  to  sue.  B  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  defendant's  prospective  inability  to  perform
would not in any jurisdiction give the defendant a right of action. For
the reason stated above, the defendant's refusal to accept delivery of
the  chickens  was  excused  by  the  plaintiff's  anticipatory  repudiation
and  was  therefore  not  a  breach.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  (Note:  C
may  be  confusing  because  of  its  use  of  the  word  impossible.  If  an
unforeseeable  change  in  circumstances  makes  it  impossible  for  a
party  to  perform  his  or  her  obligation  under  a  contract,  his  or  her

failure 
impossibility of performance. Since the defendant's refusal to accept
delivery  did  not  result  from  an  unforeseen  change  in  circumstances
but  rather  from  his  decision  to  treat  the  plaintiff's  repudiation  as  an
immediate breach, the doctrine of impossibility of performance is not
relevant  to  this  case.  If  it  were  relevant,  it  would  tend  to  defeat  the
plaintiff's claim, not support it.) Since the defendant chose to treat the
plaintiff's  anticipatory  repudiation  as  an  immediate  breach,  the

to  perform  might  be  excused  under 

1302

plaintiff cannot subsequently undo the breach by offering to perform.
D is therefore incorrect.

178. D A defendant's conduct is not privileged solely by virtue of the fact that
he  or  she  made  a  mistake.  Consequently,  while  the  defendants  may
have  made  a  good  faith  mistake  in  mistaking  the  farmer's  dog  for  a
wolf, they will still be liable for the farmer's damages.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

179. D Expression with a primarily commercial purpose may be regulated so
long  as  the  regulation  directly  advances  a  substantial  government
interest by the least burdensome means necessary. Whether protecting
the  public  against  annoyance  by  computerized  telephone  calls  is  a
substantial  government  interest  and  whether  the  prohibition  against
the  use  of  the  robocall  computer  within  the  state  directly  advances
that interest are two questions open to debate. If the answer to either
question  is  “no,”  then  the  statute  violates  the  First  Amendment.  It  is
far  from  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  but  the
argument  set  forth  in  D  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly
support the company's position.

Because  of  the  importance  of  free  expression,  the  rules  of  standing
are  ordinarily  relaxed  for  First  Amendment  challenges  based  on  a
claim  of  overbreadth.  Thus,  a  person  whose  speech  can  be
constitutionally  punished  may  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  a
statute that punishes it on the ground that the statute is “overbroad” in
that  it  also  punishes  speech  that  cannot  be  constitutionally  punished.
The  purpose  of  this  rule  is  to  prevent  the  “chilling”  of  First
Amendment  rights  by  state  regulations.  Since  it  is  believed  that
advertisers  are  unlikely  to  be  chilled  by  such  regulations,  however,
this  rule  does  not  apply  in  commercial  speech  cases.  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  The  selection  of  a  standard  to  be  applied  in  deciding  the
constitutional validity of a law regulating expression may depend on
whether the regulation is content-related. This fact alone, however, is
never sufficient to justify the conclusion that the regulation is invalid.
B is therefore incorrect. A statute is said to have a “chilling” effect on
freedom of expression if its terms are so unclear that the reasonable
person  could  not  tell  what  forms  of  expression  are  prohibited  and
might  therefore  be  afraid  to  engage  in  unprohibited  forms  of
expression.  Although  the  high  cost  of  using  telephone  solicitation
computers  outside  the  state  to  call  numbers  inside  the  state  might

1303

discourage  people  from  doing  so,  this  will  not  be  because  they  are
uncertain about what expression the law forbids. Thus, the law cannot
be said to have a chilling effect for this reason, making C incorrect.

180. A A direct restraint on alienation is a covenant or condition that attempts
to control the alienability of the estate granted. A disabling restraint
purports  to  withhold  the  grantee's  power  to  alienate.  A  promissory
restraint  consists  of  a  covenant  not  to  alienate.  It  does  not  withhold
the  covenantor's  power  to  alienate  but  subjects  the  covenantor  to
liability  for  damages  for  breaching  the  covenant  by  alienating.  A
forfeitural restraint terminates the estate upon an attempt to alienate it,
causing the property to vest in someone else. Direct restraints on the
alienation of fee simple estates are generally void and unenforceable,
whether  they  are  disabling,  promissory,  or  forfeiturial.  While
disabling restraints on the alienation of life estates are similarly void,
promissory  or  forfeiturial  restraints  on  the  alienation  of  life  estates
may be valid if reasonable. From the language of the farmer's will, it
is  difficult  to  determine  whether  the  restraint  that  it  creates  is
disabling or forfeiturial. The argument presented in A is the only one
listed, however, that might possibly support the son's claim.

B and C are incorrect because promissory and forfeiturial restraints
on the alienation of life estates may be enforceable. D is incorrect in
spite of the 40-year period that it specifies, because the son could not
possibly alienate his interest except during his own lifetime. Thus, the
vesting  of  the  daughter's  interest  could  not  possibly  occur  beyond  a
period measured by a life in being (the son's) plus 21 years, making
the Rule Against Perpetuities inapplicable to it.

181. B The “plain view” doctrine allows a police officer to seize evidence
falling  into  the  officer's  “plain  view”  when  that  officer  sees  the
evidence from a place where it is lawful for the officer to be. Here,
by consenting to have the officer in her home, the police officer was
lawfully  in  the  living  room.  However,  the  question  in  such
circumstances  is  what  the  homeowner  would  have  reasonably
believed her consent amounted to. Importantly, if one consents to have
another person in his or her home, that does not mean there is consent
for the person to open things he or she finds in the home. People do
not  expect  casual  guests  to  open  boxes,  dig  through  closets,  etc.
Therefore,  the  plain  view  doctrine  would  not  apply  because  the
homeowner did not give her consent to open the gun case. Therefore,

1304

C is incorrect.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  homeowner  leaving  the  room  did  not
change the analysis. D is incorrect because the police officer simply
saw a gun case. In many instances, guns and gun cases are perfectly
lawful. Here, the police officer did not know about the illegality until
the case was opened.

182. A  Article  I,  Section  10  of  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  the
states  from  passing  laws  impairing  the  obligation  of  contracts.  This
prevents  a  state  from  unjustifiably  repudiating  its  own  contractual
obligations or interfering with the contract rights of individuals. If the
plaintiff  was  a  state  employee  prior  to  the  time  the  mandatory
retirement  law  was  passed,  the  state  owed  him  certain  obligations
under the employment contract. Under the laws that then existed, these
included the obligations to grant an annual salary increase and to pay
a  retirement  pension  based  on  the  salary  he  earned  the  year
immediately  prior  to  this  retirement.  Accompanying  all  contract
obligations  is  the  implied  warranty  that  the  promisor  will  not
willfully prevent the promisee from enjoying the benefits thereunder.
By  mandating  retirement  at  65,  the  state  has  prevented  the  plaintiff
from  further  increasing  his  annual  salary  and  thus  increasing  the
amount  of  his  retirement  pension.  Since  he  had  this  right  under  the
employment  contract  that  existed  prior  to  passage  of  the  mandatory
retirement  law,  the  law  may  be  held  to  impair  an  obligation  of
contracts.

On the other hand, unless the plaintiff was a state employee prior to
the  passage  of  the  mandatory  retirement  law,  he  has  no  contractual
expectation  of  continued  employment  after  65.  This  is  true  even
though  he  undertook  financial  obligations  in  contemplation  of
continued employment, because although he might have detrimentally
relied  on  that  expectation,  such  reliance  was  not  justified.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  The  fact  that  the  plaintiff  was  fit  for  continued
employment after the age of 65 would not result in a finding that the
mandatory retirement law impairs the obligation of contracts because
his  fitness  did  not  create  a  contractual  expectation  unless  he  was
employed  prior  to  passage  of  the  law.  C  and  D  are  therefore
incorrect.

183. A There are various theories that might exclude performance because of
a  change  in  circumstances,  but  all  require  that  the  change  in

1305

circumstances be unforeseeable at the time the contract was formed. If
the  defendant  knew  on  May  1  that  many  hogs  in  the  area  had
contracted  the  disease,  it  was  probably  foreseeable  to  him  that  the
hog would contract it also. If the hog's disease was foreseeable to the
defendant, it would not excuse his performance under any theory.

If  performance  required  by  a  contract  becomes  illegal  after  the
contract is formed, both parties are excused from further performance.
Thus, if the state issued an order prohibiting the exhibition of the hog,
the  defendant  would  be  excused  from  exhibiting  him,  and  the  court
would  find  against  the  plaintiff.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is
incorrect because the contract called for the exhibition of the hog, and
not merely for the exhibition of a hog with the other hog's qualities, so
the  fact  that  the  defendant  had  a  hog  like  him  is  irrelevant.  D  is
incorrect  because  if  the  change  of  circumstances  that  resulted  in  the
plaintiff's loss was unforeseeable, the plaintiff cannot collect for that
loss even if it can be established with particularity.

184.  D  Under  the  doctrine  of  accession,  the  owner  of  realty  becomes  the
owner of anything that becomes part of it as well. Thus, if the storage
building has become part of the realty, the tenant may not remove it.
Unless  the  parties  agree,  however,  the  decision  as  to  whether  the
building has become part of (i.e., annexed to) the realty can be made
only by a court. A is incorrect because the landlord does not have the
power to decide it unilaterally. B is incorrect because if the building
has become part of (i.e., annexed to) the realty, the landlord is already
its owner by accession, and cannot be required to pay for it. For the
above reasons, C is also incorrect.

185. C Private nuisance is a tortious interference with the plaintiff's right to
use and enjoy real property in which he or she has a present or future
possessory interest. In effect, a plaintiff suing a defendant for private
nuisance is claiming that the defendant's use of its realty unreasonably
violates the plaintiff's right to use his or her realty. For this reason, in
deciding  a  claim  for  private  nuisance,  the  courts  must  balance  the
rights of the plaintiff and defendant in an attempt to determine which
right is more worthy of protection. In doing so, courts consider many
factors,  including  the  relative  importance  of  the  plaintiff's  and  the
defendant's activities, the appropriateness of each to the location, and
the  ability  of  each  to  avoid  the  harm  complained  of.  Because  the
insecticide is an important agricultural product, the fact that it cannot

1306

be manufactured without producing bad smells could lead a court to
conclude that the production of bad smells is not a nuisance. It is by
no means certain that a court would come to this conclusion, but of all
the  additional  facts  listed,  C  is  the  only  one  that  might  result  in  a
judgment for the company.

the 

to  obtain 

There  was  a  time  when  a  1,000-mile  distance  might  have  made  it
impossible  for  farmers 
insecticide  from  other
manufacturers.  Then,  in  balancing  the  rights  of  the  company  against
those of the farmer, a court might have concluded that the importance
of the company's activity outweighed the importance of the farmer's,
and  that  the  manufacture  of  the  insecticide  was  therefore  not  a
nuisance.  Modern  transportation  makes  that  argument  unpersuasive,
however.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  a  tenant
(i.e.,  the  holder  of  a  leasehold  interest)  has  sufficient  possessory
interest in realty to maintain an action for private nuisance against one
who  interferes  with  his  or  her  right  to  use  or  enjoy  it.  A  private
individual may not maintain an action for public nuisance unless his
or  her  harm  is  substantially  different  from  that  sustained  by  the
general public. No such requirement is imposed on the plaintiff in a
private nuisance action, however. He or she must show only that the
defendant tortiously interfered with his or her right to use and enjoy
his or her realty. D is therefore incorrect.

186.  C  Hearsay  is  defined  as  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  for  the
purpose  of  proving  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  that  statement.
The  language  of  a  promissory  note  creates  an  indebtedness.  It  is
offered into evidence for the purpose of establishing that indebtedness
(i.e.,  for  its  independent  legal  significance),  not  for  the  purpose  of
establishing  the  truth  of  any  facts  that  it  incidentally  communicates.
For this reason, it is not hearsay.

A  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  that  the  note  was
prepared  in  the  regular  course  of  business,  which  is  one  of  the
requirements  of  a  business  record.  Under  the  best  evidence  rule,
secondary evidence to prove the terms of a writing is not admissible
unless the writing itself is shown to be unavailable. This rule is thus a
rule  of  exclusion.  Although  it  may  prevent  the  admission  of  a
document that is not an original, it does not keep an original document
from being hearsay or permit the admission of an original document
that is inadmissible for other reasons. B is therefore incorrect. If an

1307

out-of-court statement is offered to prove the truth of a matter that it
asserts, it is hearsay. The fact that the declarant (i.e., the person who
made the statement) is in court does not prevent it from being hearsay
or permit its admission. D is therefore incorrect.

187.  D  Most  courts  impose  accomplice  liability  on  a  defendant  when  one
person commits a killing with reckless indifference to human life, and
the defendant, acting with the same reckless indifference, encourages
the person in the conduct leading to the death. A scenario that is likely
to  involve  accomplice  liability  for  depraved-indifference  murder  is
when  multiple  defendants  all  carry  very  dangerous  weapons  into  a
crime  scene.  Even  in  jurisdictions  not  applying  the  felony-murder
rule,  these  defendants  may  have  accomplice  liability  imposed  upon
them. Here, all three men carried extremely dangerous weapons into
the pharmacy, and all three aided and abetted each other in the crime.
The one robber then acted with depraved indifference by shooting 30
bullets into the metal ceiling, where there was a large risk of the sort
of ricochet that caused the death. Consequently, the two men who did
not  fire  their  weapons  are  accomplices  to  the  killing,  making  them
guilty  of  depraved-indifference  murder.  Thus,  A,  B,  and  C  are
incorrect.

188. D Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a), joinder of the additional contract claim
against  the  dealer  would  be  proper.  However,  a  claim  joined  under
Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  18(a)  cannot  be  brought  into  federal  court  based  on
supplemental jurisdiction unless the claims are part of the same case
or  controversy.  Because  the  contract  claim  involves  a  different
“common  nucleus  of  operative  fact”  than  the  accident,  it  must
independently  meet  the  requirements  for  federal  subject  matter
jurisdiction.  Here,  since  the  salesman  and  the  dealer  are  citizens  of
the same state, the claim would fail to do so.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  the  accident  and  the  firing  are
tangentially related, they are not part of the same case or controversy.
One claim involves the facts and evidence related to the car accident,
while the other involves facts and evidence related to the salesman's
contract. B is incorrect because the accident and the firing are not part
of  the  same  case  or  controversy,  as  stated  above.  C  is  incorrect
because all counterclaims would necessarily contain additional facts
from the main claim.

189. C The defense of improper venue is waived if it is not made either as a

1308

pre-answer  motion  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12  or  as  part  of  the
defendant's  answer.  When  the  defendants'  submitted  their  answers
without the defense, they waived it. Once that happened, “nothing . . .
shall impair the jurisdiction of a district court of any matter involving
a party who does not interpose timely and sufficient objection to the
venue.”  See  28  U.S.C.  §1406(b).  Consequently,  the  court  in  the
Western  District  of  State  A  will  get  to  hear  the  case  even  though
venue is technically improper.

Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

190. B The defendant's mother's promise to pay $1,000 is enforceable only if
it is supported by consideration. Consideration is something of value
—  either  benefit  to  the  promisor  or  detriment  to  the  promisee  —
given in exchange for the promise. A promise to do something that the
promisor has no legal right to do cannot be regarded as consideration
because it has no value. Unless a privilege exists, no person has the
right  to  refuse  to  testify  in  a  criminal  prosecution.  Certainly,  no
person  may  do  so  in  return  for  payment.  Thus,  the  victim's  promise
not to testify was a promise to do something that she had no right to
do.  For  this  reason,  it  would  not  have  been  consideration  for  the
mother's promise to pay $1,000.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  the  defendant's  mother  was  not
legally obligated to pay for damage caused by her adult son, she may
have  made  an  enforceable  promise  to  do  so.  An  accord  is  an
agreement to substitute a new obligation for one that already existed.
Satisfaction occurs when the accord is completely performed. Since
the  defendant  may  have  had  a  duty  to  pay  all  the  victim's  medical
expenses resulting from his act, and since the victim agreed to accept
$250 instead, there may have been an accord that was satisfied when
the defendant's mother paid as promised. But this accord existed only
with  respect  to  the  obligation  to  pay  medical  expenses.  Since  the
obligation to pay for pain and suffering is a separate obligation, it is
not  extinguished  by  satisfaction  of  the  accord  regarding  medical
expenses.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  promise  to  pay  the  debt  of
another is unenforceable unless it is written. But a promise to pay in
return for the promisee's forbearance to sue (even a third person) is
not  a  promise  to  pay  the  debt  of  another  but  rather  a  personal
obligation  of  the  promisor.  As  such,  it  need  not  be  in  writing.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

1309

191.  C  The  Fifth  Amendment  right  against  self-incrimination  protects  a
defendant  against  being  coerced  into  answering  questions  asked  by
the  police.  Because  police  interrogation  of  a  person  in  custody  is
inherently  coercive,  a  person  in  custody  is  entitled  to  Miranda
warnings like those given the defendant when she was first taken into
custody.  If,  after  receiving  such  warnings,  the  person  in  custody
asserts his or her right to have an attorney present during questioning,
all  interrogation  must  stop  and  may  not  be  continued  without  the
presence  of  an  attorney  or  a  subsequent  valid  waiver.  Because  any
further interrogation is regarded as coercive, a confession obtained in
its  course  is  not  admissible  in  evidence.  Although  these  rights  were
once  held  to  apply  only  to  a  person  who  was  a  suspect,  it  is  now
clear that they apply to any person in custody.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  upon  receiving  the
warnings, the defendant asserted her right to have an attorney present
during  questioning.  Although  the  police  are  required  to  advise  a
defendant of his or her rights when he or she is in custody, they are
not  required  to  advise  him  or  her  of  their  suspicions  or  of  their
reasons for asking a particular question. D is therefore incorrect.

192. C The grant of an interest in realty “for so long as” a certain condition
continues  to  exist  or  “until”  a  certain  condition  shall  exist  is
traditionally  held  to  create  a  fee  simple  determinable.  One  of  the
characteristics  of  this  particular  interest  is  that  it  terminates
automatically upon the happening of the specified event or condition.
Since the conveyance to the church was “for so long as” the land is
used  for  church  purposes,  it  was  a  fee  simple  determinable,  and  it
was  terminated  automatically  when  the  church  conveyed  the  land.
According to the language of the deed, the interest of the hospital was
to  become  possessory  at  that  time.  Although  this  might  not  have
occurred  within 
the  Rule  Against
the  period  prescribed  by 
Perpetuities,  the  hospital's  interest  is  valid  because  in  most
jurisdictions, the rule does not apply to the future interest of a charity
that follows the interest of another charity. C is correct for this reason
and because it is the only option that could possibly be correct in any
jurisdiction.

The  estate  system,  and  in  particular  the  law  of  future  interests,  was
developed  so  that  a  grantor  could  exercise  some  control  over  the
subsequent  use  of  the  land  conveyed.  For  that  reason,  restrictive

1310

language such as that contained in the landowner's deed is understood
to relate to the way the conveyed land itself is used. Although the sale
by the church might serve to enable the church to continue operation
elsewhere,  it  violates  the  special  limitation  contained  in  the
landowner's deed since it results in a cessation of the use of the land
itself  for  the  purpose  stated  in  that  limitation.  For  this  reason,  A  is
incorrect. B  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons.  First,  as  explained  above,
an  exception  prevents  the  interest  of  the  hospital  from  being  void
under  the  Rule  Against  Perpetuities.  Second,  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities  prevents  the  vesting  of  certain  interests  but  does  not
prevent the divesting of any interest. Thus, even if the interest of the
hospital  was  void  under  the  Rule,  the  violation  of  the  special
limitation  contained  in  the  landowner's  grant  would  terminate  the
interest of the church no matter when it occurred. The language of the
landowner's grant limited the use for which the realty conveyed could
be  put.  Restrictions  of  this  kind  are  enforceable,  even  though  they
indirectly  restrain  alienation.  The  effect  of  the  language  used  by  the
landowner  is  to  divest  the  church  of  its  interest  when  the  church
ceases to use the land for church purposes. Since the sale would have
that  effect,  the  church  is  divested  of  its  interest,  and  D  is  incorrect.
(Note: Sometimes the language of a conveyance attempts to directly
restrain subsequent alienation of the interest conveyed by prohibiting
such alienation. Most of the time, courts hold that direct restraints on
alienation are invalid. If a restraint on alienation is held to be valid, it
might make the person who violated it liable for damages, but it does
not void the alienation. Thus, even if the conveyance created a direct
restraint on alienation, it would not make the subsequent conveyance
by the church invalid.)

193. B Although the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate
interstate  commerce,  some  regulation  by  the  states  is  permitted  so
long  as  the  effect  is  not  to  discriminate  against  or  impose  an  undue
burden  on  interstate  commerce.  Even  state  regulations  that  do
discriminate  against  interstate  commerce  or  impose  a  burden  on  it
may be constitutional if they are aimed at a legitimate health or safety
objective that cannot be achieved by less drastic means. It is possible
that  the  additional  fact  set  forth  in  B  would  result  in  a  finding  that
Section  40  is  valid  because  it  protects  the  health  and  safety  of  the
people  of  the  state  in  the  least  drastic  way  possible.  It  is  far  from
certain that a court would come to this conclusion, but B is the only

1311

one  of  all  the  additional  facts  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  a
finding of constitutionality.

One  of  the  purposes  of  the  Commerce  Clause  is  to  ban  artificial
barriers  to  interstate  competition.  Since  the  fact  in  A  would  make
creation  of  a  business  advantage  for  in-state  nuclear  power  plants  a
purpose of the Section, it would show that the statute is designed to
create exactly the kind of artificial barrier that the Commerce Clause
was  designed  to  prevent.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  shortage  of
storage facilities within the state underscores the competition for the
use of such facilities. Thus, C would not justify finding Section 40 to
be  constitutional  since  its  terms  effectively  eliminate  out-of-staters
from  that  competition.  Even  if  there  are  many  safe  storage  locations
outside  the  state,  there  may  be  sound  business  reasons  why  out-of-
staters prefer to use state locations. The discrimination resulting from
the  provisions  of  Section  40  would  thus  not  be  justified  by  the
existence of out-of-state locations. D is therefore incorrect.

194. B It is generally understood that evidence of a person's bad character is
inadmissible  for  the  purpose  of  proving  that  he  or  she  acted  in  a
particular way on a particular occasion. Since evidence of a criminal
conviction is evidence of character, it is usually excluded by this rule.
Under  FRE  609,  a  judgment  of  conviction  may  be  admitted  for  the
purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness, however, because
it tends to establish that the person convicted is untrustworthy. If the
defendant did not testify, there is no reason to impeach his credibility,
and evidence of his prior conviction would be inadmissible.

On the other hand, if he did testify, evidence of his conviction would
be  admissible  under  the  FRE.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Under  FRE
609,  evidence  of  a  conviction  for  a  felony  in  any  state  or  nation  is
admissible  to  impeach  a  witness  without  regard  to  the  nature  of  the
felony.  Since  involuntary  manslaughter  is  a  felony,  C  is  incorrect.
Since the FRE make a conviction from any state or nation admissible,
D is incorrect.

195. B To get a copy of the police report, the boxer's attorney must cause the
clerk of the court to issue a subpoena duces tecum (an order requiring
the  recipient  to  appear  before  the  court  and  produce  documents)  on
the police department under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45.

A is  incorrect  because  a  request  to  produce  documents  may  only  be

1312

served  on  a  party  to  the  suit.  See  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  34. C  is  incorrect
because it is unnecessary to take the deposition of the police officer
in order to get the police report. D is incorrect because only parties to
an action are required to respond to interrogatories. See Fed. R. Civ.
P. 33(a).

196. B A plaintiff who experiences mental suffering as a result of witnessing
the  infliction  of  a  physical  injury  on  another  may  recover  from  a
person  who  negligently  inflicted  that  physical  injury.  Although  the
majority of jurisdictions permit such recovery only when the plaintiff
is  in  the  same  zone  of  physical  danger  as  the  person  who  sustained
physical injury, an important minority permit the plaintiff to recover if
his  or  her  mental  suffering  was  a  foreseeable  result  of  the  physical
injury  that  he  or  she  witnessed.  In  this  minority  of  jurisdictions,  the
plaintiff might recover from the manufacturer for her mental suffering
at witnessing the patient's death if it was likely (i.e., foreseeable) that
the  manufacturer's  negligence  in  causing  the  patient's  death  would
lead to the plaintiff's mental suffering. Because this is a minority rule,
there is no guarantee that it would lead to a judgment for the plaintiff.
Of those listed, however, B is the only argument that could possibly
be effective in support of the plaintiff's claim.

A  defendant  who  engages  in  outrageous  conduct  with  the  intent  to
cause  the  plaintiff  to  experience  mental  suffering  may  be  liable  for
mental  suffering  that  the  plaintiff  experiences  as  a  result.  A  is
incorrect,  however,  for  two  reasons:  First,  outrageous  conduct  is
conduct that exceeds bounds normally tolerated by decent society, not
conduct that creates a high probability of harm, and second, there is
no fact indicating that the manufacturer intended to cause the plaintiff
to  experience  mental  suffering.  When  a  plaintiff  voluntarily
encounters  a  risk  of  which  he  or  she  knows,  he  or  she  assumes  that
risk.  Since  the  plaintiff  did  not  know  that  the  oxygen  tank  contained
anesthetic gas, she could not have assumed the risk resulting from that
fact. C is incorrect for this reason and because assumption of the risk
would prevent the plaintiff from recovering. A defendant who intends
mental  suffering  to  result  from  its  outrageous  conduct  may  be  liable
for  the  intentional  infliction  of  mental  harm.  In  this  regard,  a
substantial  certainty  that  the  suffering  will  occur  is  equivalent  to  an
intent to bring it about. D is incorrect, however, because even if the
manufacturer  was  certain  that  the  apparatus  would  be  used  on  a
patient, it did not intend the plaintiff's suffering unless it was certain

1313

that  the  patient  would  die  and  that  the  plaintiff  would  suffer  as  a
result.

197.  B  A  conspiracy  occurs  when  two  or  more  persons  with  the  specific
intent to commit a crime agree to commit it. Since the druggist did not
believe that the wife would be hurt by the drug that he furnished, he
did  not  have  the  requisite  specific  intent  and  did  not  really  agree  to
commit murder. For this reason, there was never an actual agreement
between him and the man, and therefore no conspiracy.

Conspiracy, if it exists, is separate from the substantive crime and is
complete  when  the  unlawful  agreement  is  made.  For  this  reason,  a
defendant  may  be  guilty  of  conspiring  to  commit  a  particular  crime
even though he or she never succeeded and was not likely to succeed
in  committing  it.  A  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because  it  is  an  inaccurate  statement  of  law:  The  inchoate  crime  of
conspiracy never merges with the substantive crime; a defendant can
be convicted of both.

198. A Under FRE 803(6), a properly authenticated writing may be admitted
under the business record exception to the hearsay rule if it was made
in the regular course of business while fresh in the declarant's mind
about  facts  that  the  declarant  knew  or  learned  from  an  inherently
reliable  source.  Since  the  witness's  testimony  satisfied  all  these
requirements,  the  personnel  file  should  be  admitted  as  a  business
record.  (Note:  Do  not  be  confused  about  a  controversy  that  exists
over whether police records describing an accident  are  kept  in  the
“regular  course  of  business.”  Police  department  personnel  records
clearly are.)

B  is  incorrect  because  to  be  admissible  as  “past  recollection
recorded,” a writing must have been made by the witness himself or
herself,  and  because  under  FRE  803(5)  and  the  common  law,  the
writing may be read aloud but not physically admitted into evidence.
C  is  incorrect  because  business  records  and  official  written
statements  may  be  used  by  any  party.  Although  negative  evidence
presents some special problems, FRE 803(7) specifically permits the
absence  of  a  business  record  to  be  admissible  as  evidence  that  an
unrecorded transaction did not occur.

199. B A motion for judgment as a matter of law is made before the case is
submitted  to  a  jury  and  asks  the  court  for  judgment  in  the  moving
party's favor based on the argument that no reasonable person could

1314

come to a different conclusion. A renewed motion for judgment as a
matter of law comes after entry of judgment and can only be made if
the  moving  party  made  a  motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law
during the trial. Because the bank did not make a motion for judgment
as a matter of law during trial, it cannot now try to make one after the
entry of judgment.

A is incorrect because a motion for judgment as a matter of law does
not  need  to  be  supported  by  new  evidence.  C  and  D  are  incorrect
because the bank had to have made a motion for judgment as a matter
of  law  before  the  jury  verdict  to  have  the  court  grant  the  bank's
attempt at a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law after the
verdict.

200. A  Under  28  U.S.C.  §1446(b),  a  defendant  must  file  notice  of  removal
within  30  days  after  formal  service  of  the  complaint.  Since  the
builder removed 29 days after formal service, the builder's removal
was  timely.  See  Murphy  Brothers  v.  Michetti  Pipe  Stringing,  Inc.,
526 U.S. 344 (1999).

B  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  special  rule  regarding  notice  by
certified mail. C is incorrect because the 30-day period begins when
the defendant receives official service. D is incorrect because there is
no rule regarding challenging notice received by email.

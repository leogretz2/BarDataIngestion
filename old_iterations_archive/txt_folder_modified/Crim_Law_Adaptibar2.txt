Question 1113 - Criminal Law - Inchoate Crimes

 The question was: 

An eighteen-year-old boyfriend and his 14-year-old girlfriend made plans to meet in the boyfriend's apartment
to have sexual intercourse, and they did so. The girlfriend later told her mother about the incident. The
boyfriend was charged with statutory rape and conspiracy to commit statutory rape. 

In the jurisdiction, the age of consent is 15, and the law of conspiracy is the same as at common law. 

The boyfriend was convicted of both charges and given consecutive sentences. On appeal, he contends that
his conspiracy conviction should be reversed.  

That conviction should be 

A: affirmed, because he agreed with the girlfriend to commit the crime.
B: reversed, because the girlfriend could not be a conspirator to this crime.
C: reversed, because the crime is one that can only be committed by agreement and thus Wharton's Rule bars
conspiracy liability.
D: reversed, because one cannot conspire with a person too young to consent.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Because the charge of statutory rape is meant to protect minor children, and the
girlfriend is a member of the protected class, the girlfriend cannot be charged with the crime of conspiracy to
commit statutory rape. Because it is impossible for the girlfriend to commit the crime, she cannot be a
conspirator to the crime, and the boyfriend's conviction for conspiracy should be reversed. 

Answer A is incorrect because a conspiracy charge not only requires that there be an agreement, but also that
both parties be capable of committing the offense. Because the girlfriend cannot be a conspirator to statutory
rape, the boyfriend cannot be convicted of conspiring with her. 

Answer C is incorrect because Wharton's rule only applies in cases where the crime to be committed is one
that, by definition requires the voluntary concerted criminal participation of two persons. Statutory rape can be
committed without the voluntary concerted criminal participation of the minor victim. Because statutory rape
can be committed by only one of the participants, Wharton's rule does not apply. 

Answer D is incorrect because it is possible to conspire with a minor to commit a crime. The reason the
girlfriend cannot be a conspirator is because she is the protected victim, not because she is presumed
incapable of consenting. Because the boyfriend was convicted of conspiring with someone who is incapable of
committing the underlying charge, his conviction should be reversed.

Question 1114 - Criminal Law - Homicide

 The question was: 

An employee decided to kill his boss after she told him that he would be fired if his work did not improve. The
employee knew his boss was scheduled to go on a business trip on Monday morning. On Sunday morning, the
employee went to the company parking garage and put a bomb in the company car that his boss usually
drove. The bomb was wired to go off when the car engine started. The employee then left town. At 5 a.m.
Monday, the employee, after driving all night, was overcome with remorse and had a change of heart. He
called the security officer on duty at the company and told him about the bomb. The security officer said he
would take care of the matter. An hour later, the officer put a note on the boss's desk telling her of the
message. He then looked at the car but could not see any signs of a bomb. He printed a sign saying, "DO NOT
USE THIS CAR," put it on the windshield, and went to call the police. Before the police arrived, a company
vice president got into the car and started the engine. The bomb went off, killing her. 

The jurisdiction defines murder in the first degree as any homicide committed with premeditation and
deliberation or any murder in the commission of a common-law felony. Second-degree murder is defined as all
other murder at common law. Manslaughter is defined by the common law. 

The employee is guilty of 

A: murder in the first degree, because, with premeditation and deliberation, he killed whoever would start the
car.
B: murder in the second degree, because he had no intention of killing the company vice president.
C: manslaughter, because at the time of the explosion, he had no intent to kill, and the death of the company
vice president was in part the fault of the security officer.
D: only attempted murder of his boss, because the death of the company vice president was the result of the
security officer's negligence.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The employee, with premeditation and deliberation, caused the company vice
president's death. Although his intent was to kill his boss, the doctrine of transferred intent will presume that
intent to go with whomever started the vehicle. 

Answer B is incorrect because the employee had the requisite intent to kill, and the requisite premeditation and
deliberation, and that intent is transferred to the person who started the car. Although the employee did not
intend to kill the company vice president in particular, he is guilty of first degree murder. 

Answer C is incorrect because, although at the precise moment the company vice president was killed, the
employee did not have the intent to kill anyone, when he took the actions that led to the vice president's death,
he did have the intent to kill. The employee cannot escape liability for murder merely because he changed his
mind after he set the murder in motion. Regardless of the employee's attempt to stop anyone from using the
vehicle, he will still bear criminal responsibility for originally placing the bomb in the vehicle with the intent to
murder his boss. 

Answer D is incorrect because the security officer's failure to save the company vice president's life is not an
intervening act that would negate the employee's responsibility in causing the vice president's death. It was
completely foreseeable that someone other than the boss would be killed as a result of the employee's actions,
and the security guard's failure to stop the company vice president will not negate the employee's guilt.
Therefore, the employee is guilty of first degree murder.

Question 1120 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A marijuana farmer had been missing for several months. The sheriff's department received an anonymous tip
that a rival marijuana farmer had buried the marijuana farmer in a hillside about 200 yards from the rival's
farmhouse. The sheriff's deputies went to the rival's farm. They cut the barbed wire that surrounded the hillside
and entered, looking for the grave. They also searched the adjacent fields on the rival's farm that were within
the area enclosed by the barbed wire and discovered clothing that belonged to the marijuana farmer hanging
on a scarecrow. The rival observed their discovery and began shooting. The deputies returned fire. The rival
dashed to his pickup truck to escape. Unable to start the truck, he fled across a field toward the barn. A deputy
tackled him just as he entered the barn. 

As the rival attempted to get up, the deputy pinned his arms behind his back. Another deputy threatened, "Tell
us what you did with the marijuana farmer or we will shut you down and see your family on relief." The rival
responded that he had killed the marijuana farmer in a fight but did not report the incident because he did not
want authorities to enter his land and discover his marijuana crop. Instead, he buried him behind the barn. The
rival was thereafter charged with murder. 

If the rival moves to exclude the introduction of the marijuana farmer's clothing into evidence, the court should 

A: grant the motion, because the deputies had not obtained a warrant.
B: grant the motion, because the deputies' conduct in its entirety violated the rival's right to due process of law.
C: deny the motion, because the rival had no expectation of privacy in the fields around his farmhouse.
D: deny the motion, because the clothing was not the rival's property.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The fields around the rival's farmhouse are considered held out to the public under
the "open fields" doctrine, so the rival did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in them or in the
scarecrow on which the victim's clothes were hanging. Because the fields were not protected by the Fourth
Amendment, the police officers' search did not violate the rival's constitutional rights. The rival's motion to
suppress should be denied. 

Answer A is incorrect because the rival had no reasonable expectation of privacy in lands visible to the public,
and the police officer's did not need to obtain a warrant to see the evidence. 

Answer B is incorrect because it is a misstatement of the relevant law regarding search and seizure; answer B
refers to the rival's right to due process of law, whereas search and seizure law is covered by the fourth
amendment. 

Answer D is incorrect because actual ownership of the searched or seized property is not the deciding factor in
determining the propriety of the search. Because the clothing was on the rival's land when the search and
seizure occurred, the fact that it belonged to somebody else is irrelevant. Therefore, because the rival did not
have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the lands around his farmhouse, the clothing should not be
suppressed.

Question 1133 - Criminal Law - Homicide

 The question was: 

A teenager's high school teacher told her that she was going to receive a failing grade in history, which would
prevent her from graduating. Furious, she reported to the principal that the teacher had fondled her, and the
teacher was fired. A year later, still unable to get work because of the scandal, the teacher committed suicide.
The teenager, remorseful, confessed that her accusation had been false. 

If the teenager is charged with manslaughter, her best defense would be that she 

A: committed no act that proximately caused the teacher's death.
B: did not intend to cause the teacher's death.
C: did not act with malice.
D: acted under extreme emotional distress.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The teacher committed suicide, and the teenager committed no act that was a
proximate cause of the teacher's death. A defendant will only be held criminally responsible for the foreseeable
consequences of her actions. The suicide by the teacher was not a foreseeable consequence of the
teenager's lying. 

Answer B is incorrect because a charge of manslaughter does not require proof of intent to kill. Answer C is
incorrect because a charge of manslaughter does not require proof of malice, either. Manslaughter is generally
defined as causing the death of another without malice aforethought. The teenager's lack of intent to kill and
her lack of malice are not defenses to a manslaughter charge. Answer D is incorrect because acting under
extreme emotional distress generally is not a defense to a manslaughter charge. Unless the teenager could
show that she was legally insane, emotional distress may be insufficient to raise a valid defense. The fact that
the teacher killed herself and the teenager did not proximately cause that death is the teenager's best defense
to the charge of manslaughter.

Question 1159 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

On May 1, 1987, a car driven by the defendant struck a pedestrian. On July 1, 1987, with regard to this
incident, the defendant pleaded guilty to reckless driving (a misdemeanor) and was sentenced to 30 days in
jail and a fine of $1,000. She served the sentence and paid the fine. On April 1, 1988, the pedestrian died as a
result of the injuries she suffered in the accident. On March 1, 1991, a grand jury indicted the defendant on a
charge of manslaughter of the pedestrian. On May 15, 1991, trial had not begun and the defendant filed a
motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground of double jeopardy in that her conviction of reckless driving
arose out of the same incident, and on the ground that the three-year statute of limitations for manslaughter
had run. 

The defendant's motion should be 

A: granted only on double jeopardy grounds.
B: granted only on statute of limitations grounds.
C: granted on either double jeopardy grounds or statute of limitations grounds.
D: denied on both grounds.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The charge of manslaughter has additional elements that reckless driving does not,
namely the causing of the death of another; therefore, reckless driving is not a lesser included offense of
manslaughter. The state may properly charge the defendant with the offense of manslaughter after the
pedestrian died as a result of the accident, without it being a violation of the defendant's rights under the
double jeopardy clause. The death of the pedestrian, which occurred on April 1, 1988, was the final element of
the offense of manslaughter to occur, and the state had 3 years from that date to charge the offense. Because
the defendant was indicted on March 1, 1991, the state was within the statute of limitations in charging her with
manslaughter, so the defendant's motion to dismiss on that ground should also be denied. 

Answer A is incorrect because the defendant, when she pleaded guilty to reckless driving, was not put in
jeopardy for the later death of the pedestrian, which was the basis for the manslaughter charge. Answer B is
incorrect because the defendant was indicted within the three year statute of limitations from the date of the
pedestrian's death. Answer C is incorrect for both of those reasons. The defendant's motion to dismiss the
manslaughter charge should be denied on both grounds.

Question 1164 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

FBI agents, without a warrant and without permission of Mexican law enforcement or judicial officers, entered
Mexico, kidnapped an American citizen wanted in the United States for drug smuggling violations, and forcibly
drove him back to Texas. Thereafter, the agents, again without a warrant, broke into the Texas home of a
woman wanted as a confederate of the kidnapped person, and arrested her. 

The kidnapped person and the woman were both indicted for narcotics violations. Both moved to dismiss the
indictment on the ground that their arrests violated the Fourth Amendment. 

The court should 

A: grant the motions of both the kidnapped person and the woman.
B: grant the motion of the kidnapped person and deny the motion of the woman.
C: grant the motion of the woman and deny the motion of the kidnapped person.
D: deny the motions of both the kidnapped person and the woman.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. An unlawful arrest does not serve an adequate reason to dismiss an indictment.
Although the kidnapped person and the woman may have been arrested in violation of the Fourth Amendment,
the remedy for that violation is not the dismissal of the indictment against them. Answers A, B, and C are
incorrect because the remedies for an unlawful arrest do not include the dismissal of an indictment against
properly charged defendants. Regardless of the propriety of the arrest, a court will not dismiss an otherwise
properly obtained indictment.

Question 1203 - Criminal Law - Homicide

 The question was: 

Nine gang members were indicted for the murder of a tenth gang member who had become an informant. The
gang leader plead guilty. At the trial of the other eight, the state's evidence showed the following: The gang
leader announced a party to celebrate the recent release of a gang member from jail. But the party was not
what it seemed. The gang leader had learned that the recently released gang member had earned his freedom
by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let
the other gang members see what happens to a snitch. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after all
present had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member
was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others. The eight other gang members watched
and did nothing while the informant slowly bled to death. The jury found the eight gang members guilty of
murder and they appealed. 

Should the appellate court uphold the convictions? 

A: No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make one an accomplice.
B: No, because murder is a specific intent crime, and there is insufficient evidence to show that they intended
to kill.
C: Yes, because the gang members made no effort to save the informant after he had been stabbed.
D: Yes, because voluntary intoxication does not negate criminal responsibility.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Murder is the intentional killing of another human being with malice aforethought. The
eight gang members are not guilty of murder because they took no affirmative act and were merely present at
what turned out to be a crime scene. 

Answer B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the convictions should not be upheld, but it misstates
the legal basis for this conclusion. Murder does not require specific intent to kill; it may be committed in other
circumstances (e.g., intent-to-do-serious-bodily-harm murder, depraved-heart murder, and felony murder). In
this case, the eight gang members are not guilty of murder because they took no affirmative act and were
merely present at what turned out to be a crime scene. 

Answer C is incorrect. The eight gang members did not have a legal duty, enforceable by the criminal laws, to
save the informant. Moreover, they are not responsible for the murder because they took no affirmative act
and were merely present at what turned out to be a crime scene. 

Answer D is incorrect. The conclusion is wrong and the stated principle is irrelevant here. In this case, the
eight gang members were not responsible for the murder regardless of whether they were sober or intoxicated.
This is because they took no affirmative act and were merely present at what turned out to be a crime scene.

Question 1217 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A state legislature passed a statute providing that juries in criminal trials were to consist of 6 rather than 12
jurors, and providing that jury verdicts did not have to be unanimous but could be based on 5 votes out of 6
jurors. A defendant was tried for murder. Over his objection, he was tried by a jury composed of 6 jurors. The
jurors found him guilty by a vote of 5 to 1 and, over the defendant's objection, the court entered a judgment of
conviction, which was affirmed on appeal by the state supreme court. The defendant seeks to overturn his
conviction in a habeas corpus action in federal court, claiming his constitutional rights were violated by
allowing a jury verdict that was not unanimous and by allowing a jury composed of fewer than 12 members. 

How is the federal court likely to rule in this action? 

A: It will set aside the conviction, because the jury was composed of fewer than 12 members.
B: It will set aside the conviction, because the 6-person jury verdict was not unanimous.
C: It will set aside the conviction for both reasons.
D: It will uphold the conviction.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The Constitution requires unanimity where only a 6-person jury is used. Thus, answer B is
correct, and answer D is incorrect. 

Answer A is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the conviction will be set aside, but it misstates the
legal basis for the conclusion. The Constitution does not require 12-person juries. 

Answer C is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the conviction will be set aside, but it misstates the
legal basis for the conclusion. The Constitution does not require 12-person juries, although it does require
unanimity where only a 6-person jury is used.

Question 1222 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

Police officers received a tip that drug dealing was occurring at a certain ground-floor duplex apartment. They
decided to stake out the apartment. The stakeout revealed that a significant number of people visited the
apartment for short periods of time and then left. A man exited the apartment and started to walk briskly away.
The officers grabbed the man and, when he struggled, wrestled him to the ground. They searched him and
found a bag of heroin in one of his pockets. After discovering the heroin on the man, the police decided to
enter the apartment. They knocked on the door, which was opened by the woman who lived there. The police
asked if they could come inside, and the woman gave them permission to do so. Once inside, the officers
observed several bags of heroin on the living room table. The woman is charged with possession of the heroin
found on the living room table. She moves pretrial to suppress the heroin on the ground that it was obtained by
virtue of an illegal search and seizure. 

Should the woman's motion be granted? 

A: No, because the tip together with the heroin found in the man's pocket provided probable cause for the
search.
B: No, because the woman consented to the officers' entry.
C: Yes, because the officers' decision to enter the house was the fruit of an illegal search of the man.
D: Yes, because the officers did not inform the woman that she could refuse consent.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. In the absence of an exception, the Fourth Amendment requires that police have both
probable cause and a search warrant before they are able to enter a private dwelling. Here, no such warrant
existed. However, police may conduct a valid warrantless search if they have a voluntary and intelligent
consent to do so. Here, the facts do not indicate that the police improperly obtained the woman's consent. The
woman's consent justified the officers' entry. Once inside, the police properly seized the heroin because it was
in plain view. Police may make a warrantless seizure when they are legitimately on the premises and discover
evidence that is in plain view that they have probable cause to believe is evidence or a fruit or instrumentality
of crime. Here, the woman's consent gave the police legitimate authority to be inside the building, they
discovered the heroin on a living room table, and the criminal nature of the heroin was readily apparent. 

Answer A is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the woman's motion to suppress the heroin should not
be granted, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. Even assuming there was probable cause to
search the home, a warrant would have been required for entry had the woman not consented. The woman's
consent justified the officers' entry, and the heroin was properly seized because it was in plain view. 

Answer C is incorrect. The search of the man, even assuming it was improper, did not violate the woman's
rights, and therefore provides no basis for suppressing evidence found in her house. The woman's consent
justified the officers' entry, and the heroin was properly seized because it was in plain view. 

Answer D is incorrect. There is no requirement that officers inform individuals of their right to refuse consent.
The woman's consent justified the officers' entry, and the heroin was properly seized because it was in plain
view.

Question 1226 - Criminal Law - Homicide

 The question was: 

A husband and wife took their 12-year-old son to a political rally to hear a controversial United States senator
speak. The speaker was late, and the wife stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. While there, she saw a man
placing what she believed to be a bomb against a wall at the back of the building. She went back inside and
told her husband what she had seen. Without alerting anyone, they took their son and left. Some 20 minutes
later, the bomb exploded, killing eight persons and injuring 50. In the jurisdiction, murder in the first degree is
defined as an intentional homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation; murder in the second
degree is defined as all other murder at common law; and manslaughter is defined as either a homicide in the
heat of passion arising from adequate provocation or a homicide caused by gross negligence or reckless
indifference to consequence. 

As to the deaths of the eight persons, what crime, if any, did the wife commit? 

A: Manslaughter.
B: Murder in the first degree.
C: Murder in the second degree.
D: No crime.

The explanation for the answer is:

D is correct. The wife is not guilty of any crime because she did not have a legal duty, enforceable by the
criminal laws, to warn the others about the bomb. Thus, answer D is correct, and answers A, B, and C are
incorrect.

Question 1227 - Criminal Law - Other Crimes

 The question was: 

A woman decided to steal a necklace that belonged to her neighbor. She knew where the neighbor kept the
necklace because she had been in the neighbor's house on many occasions when the neighbor had taken off
the necklace and put it away in a jewelry box in the bathroom. One night, the woman went to the neighbor's
house. The neighbor was away, and the house was dark. The woman opened the bathroom window, saw the
jewelry box on the counter, and started to climb inside. As her leg cleared the window sill, the neighbor's cat let
out a loud screech. Terrified, the woman bolted back outside and fled. 

The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. What is the most serious crime committed by
the woman? 

A: Burglary.
B: Attempted burglary.
C: Attempted larceny.
D: No crime.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The woman is guilty of burglary because she unlawfully entered the neighbor's house at
night with intent to commit a felony (larceny). The woman's actions constituted the requisite "entry" of the
neighbor's house. To constitute burglary it is sufficient if any part of the actor's person intruded, even
momentarily, into the structure. Thus it has been held that the intrusion of a part of a hand in opening a
window, or the momentary intrusion of part of a foot in kicking out a window, constituted the requisite entry.
Answers B and D are incorrect. 

Answer C is incorrect. The woman may have been guilty of attempted larceny, but that crime arguably would
merge into, and in any event was less serious than, the crime of burglary. As explained above, the woman is
guilty of burglary because she unlawfully entered the neighbor's house at night with intent to commit a felony
(larceny). The woman's actions constituted the requisite "entry" of the neighbor's house.

Question 1235 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with manslaughter. At the preliminary hearing, the magistrate dismissed the charge
on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient. The prosecutor then brought the case before a grand jury.
After hearing the evidence presented by the prosecutor, the grand jury refused to return an indictment. The
prosecutor waited a few months until a new grand jury had been impaneled and brought the case before that
grand jury, which returned an indictment charging the defendant with manslaughter. The defendant moves to
dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. 

Should the motion be granted? 

A: No, because jeopardy had not attached.
B: No, because there has been no conviction or acquittal.
C: Yes, because any proceeding after the preliminary hearing would violate double jeopardy.
D: Yes, because bringing the case before the second grand jury was a violation of double jeopardy.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Jeopardy does not attach at a preliminary hearing (Collins v. Loisell, 262 U.S. 426, 429
(1923)) or at a grand jury proceeding (United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 49 (1992)). Jeopardy attaches in
a jury trial when the jury is sworn and in a bench trial when the court begins to hear evidence. Jeopardy did not
attach at either hearing--the preliminary hearing, or the grand jury proceeding. 

Answer B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the motion should not be granted, but it misstates the
legal basis for this conclusion. Jeopardy attaches prior to judgment (whether on conviction or acquittal). 

Answer C is incorrect. As explained above, the double jeopardy clause does not attach to preliminary
hearings. 

Answer D is incorrect. The double jeopardy clause does not bar a grand jury from returning an indictment
when a prior grand jury refused to do so. United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 49 (1992).

Question 1247 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A woman who is a computer whiz decided to dedicate herself to exposing persons who traffic in child
pornography. She posted a number of sexually oriented photographs on her web site. The file for each
photograph contained an embedded Trojan horse program. The defendant downloaded one of those
photographs onto his personal computer. Using the embedded program, the woman entered the defendant's
computer and found a file containing a pornographic photograph of a child. She copied the file and turned it
over to a federal law enforcement agency. A federal agent told her that a successful prosecution would require
more than one photograph and offered her a monetary reward for additional photos leading to a conviction of
the defendant. The woman entered the defendant's computer again, and this time she found hundreds of child
pornography photos, which she turned over to the federal agency. The defendant is charged with multiple
counts of violating federal statutes regarding child pornography. He moves to suppress the photographs that
the woman discovered on his computer. The motion is based on both the Fourth Amendment and a federal
statute forbidding interception of electronic communication without permission. The parties have stipulated that
the woman's conduct in downloading photos from the defendant's computer violated the interception statute. 

How should the court rule on the defendant's motion to suppress? 

A: Deny it as to all photographs.
B: Grant it as to all photographs, because the woman acted without probable cause.
C: Grant it as to all photographs, because the woman violated the federal interception statute.
D: Grant it only as to the second set of photographs.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. A court will only grant a motion to suppress evidence based on a Fourth Amendment
violation if the actor who obtained the evidence was a government agent. The woman's first entry of the
computer and copying of the file constituted an entirely private search and did not trigger Fourth Amendment
protections. The second set of photographs should be suppressed because authorities encouraged and
offered to reward the second computer search. As such, the woman was acting as a government agent with
regard to that search, which did in fact violate the Fourth Amendment because it was conducted without a
warrant. See United States v. Jarrett, 338 F.3d 339, 344-48 (4th Cir. 2003) (describing relevant considerations,
and finding on facts less compelling than these that private hacker was not government agent). Thus, answer
D is correct, and answers A, B, and C are incorrect.

Question 1271 - Criminal Law - General Principles

 The question was: 

A woman drove her car through the drive-through lane of a fast-food restaurant in the afternoon. When she
reached the microphone used to place orders, she said, "There's a man across the street with a rifle. He can
see everything you do. If you do not do exactly what I tell you, he will shoot you. Put all the money from the
register into a sack and give it to me when I drive up." The clerk did not see anyone across the street and was
unsure whether anyone was there. However, unwilling to risk harm to himself, he put $500 in a paper bag and
handed it to the woman when she drove up to the delivery window. The woman drove off with the money but
was arrested a short time later. She had lied about the man with a rifle and had acted alone. 

Of what crime or crimes can the woman be convicted? 

A: Embezzlement.
B: Obtaining property by false pretenses.
C: Robbery and larceny.
D: Robbery or larceny.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. All the elements of larceny and robbery were present. Larceny is the trespassory taking
and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of his
interest in the property. Robbery is the taking of personal property of another from the other's person by force
or intimidation with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. The woman's threat of immediate harm to the
clerk was sufficient to constitute the intimidation required for robbery. 

Answer A is incorrect. Embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of property of another by a person in lawful
possession of that property. The woman never had lawful possession of the money and so cannot be
convicted of embezzlement. 

Answer B is incorrect. Theft by false pretenses occurs when a person obtains title to the property of another by
an intentional or knowing false statement of past or existing fact with the intent to defraud the other. The crime
was not false pretenses because, among other things, the woman never obtained title to the cash. 

Answer C is incorrect. It is true that all the elements of larceny and robbery (which "may be thought of as
aggravated larceny") were present, as explained above. However, because robbery and larceny are greater
and lesser included offenses, a defendant cannot be convicted of both for a single offense.

Question 1277 - Criminal Law - General Principles

 The question was: 

A customer asked to see an expensive watch in a jewelry store. In conversation with the clerk, the customer
falsely claimed to be the son of the mayor. When handed the watch, he asked if he could put it on, walk
around a bit so he could see how it felt on his wrist, and then briefly step outside to observe it in natural light.
The clerk agreed, saying, "I know I can trust someone like you with the merchandise." The customer walked
out of the store wearing the watch and never returned. A week later, the clerk was at a gathering when she
spotted the customer wearing the watch. She told him that he must either pay for the watch or give it back. He
hissed, "I'll knock your block off if you mess with me." Intimidated, the clerk backed off. The following list of
crimes is in descending order of seriousness. 

What is the most serious crime the customer committed? 

A: Robbery.
B: Larceny.
C: False pretenses.
D: Embezzlement.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The most serious crime the defendant committed is larceny. The customer committed a
trespassory taking and carrying away of another's property with the intent to steal it. He obtained possession
of, but not title to, the watch by lying about a present fact. 

Answer A is incorrect. There was no robbery because the customer did not take the watch by force or threat of
force. Instead, he committed larceny—-a trespassory taking and carrying away of another's property with the
intent to steal it. He obtained possession of, but not title to, the watch by lying about a present fact.  

Answer C is incorrect. Theft by false pretenses occurs when the defendant obtains title to the property of
another by an intentional (or knowing) false statement of past or existing fact with the intent to defraud the
other. The crime was larceny, not false pretenses, because the customer obtained possession of, but not title
to, the watch. 

Answer D is incorrect. Embezzlement occurs when the defendant fraudulently converts the property of
another, and where the defendant is in lawful possession of that property. Here, the crime was larceny, not
embezzlement, because there was a trespassory taking, so the customer never was in lawful possession of
the watch.

Question 1291 - Criminal Law - Inchoate Crimes

 The question was: 

Four men are charged with conspiracy to commit a series of bank robberies. Nine successful bank robberies
took place during the period of the charged conspiracy. Because the robbers wore masks and gloves and stole
the bank surveillance tapes, no direct identification of the robbers by the witnesses has been made. Some
circumstantial evidence ties each of the men to the overall conspiracy. During cross-examination, a
prosecution witness testified that one defendant was in jail on other charges during six of the robberies. That
defendant's lawyer has moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case. 

Should the motion be granted? 

A: No, because a conspirator is not required to agree to all of the objects of the conspiracy.
B: No, because a conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime conspired upon.
C: Yes, provided the defendant has complied with the rule requiring pretrial notice of alibi.
D: Yes, regardless of compliance with the alibi rule, because the government is bound by exculpatory
evidence elicited during its case-in-chief.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. At common law, a conspiracy is defined as an agreement between two or more persons
to accomplish some unlawful goal, or to accomplish some lawful goal by unlawful means. A co-conspirator
need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically
terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to carry out the goals of the conspiracy. So
long as there is an initial agreement among the conspirators to engage in a course of criminal conduct
constituting all the crimes, there is only one conspiracy. 

Answer A is incorrect. Conspirators must agree on the essential objectives of the conspiracy. In any event, the
rationale offered here is inapposite because the problem raised by the question is not failure to agree to the
robberies, but not being present during the latter robberies. The defendant's motion for acquittal in this case
should be denied because a co-conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does
the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue
to carry out the goals of the conspiracy. 

Answer C is incorrect. The defendant is not entitled to acquittal of conspiracy, even if there was compliance
with an alibi notice rule. A co-conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the
arrest of one co-conspirator automatically terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to
carry out the goals of the conspiracy. In this case, even if the defendant showed that he was in prison during
several of the robberies, he could be convicted of the conspiracy. 

Answer D is incorrect. The defendant is not entitled to acquittal of conspiracy because a co-conspirator need
not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically
terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to carry out the goals of the conspiracy. In this
case, even if the evidence showed that the defendant was in prison during several of the robberies, he could
be convicted of the conspiracy. Furthermore, the reasoning stated in this answer, that "the government is
bound by exculpatory evidence elicited during its case-in-chief," is incorrect.

Question 1302 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A defendant was lawfully arrested without a warrant for bank robbery. He was not given Miranda warnings, but
was immediately taken to a police station where he and five other men were placed in a lineup to be viewed by
the bank teller. Each man was required to say the words spoken by the bank robber: "Give me all your money.
I've got a gun." After all the men in the lineup spoke those words, the teller identified the defendant as the
robber. 

The defendant subsequently moved to suppress the testimony of the teller, claiming the lineup violated his
privilege against self-incrimination. At a suppression hearing, the teller testified that she had not gotten a good
look at the robber's face, because the robber had been wearing a hat pulled down over most of his face, but
that she was certain the defendant was the robber because she had recognized his voice at the lineup. 

Should the defendant's motion be granted?  

A: No, because being required to speak at the lineup, while compelled, was not testimonial or communicative.
B: No, because testimony of a witness based on firsthand observation is not subject to exclusion as the fruit of
the poisonous tree.
C: Yes, because the defendant was compelled to speak at the lineup, and this compelled speech led to the
witnesss identification testimony.
D: Yes, because the defendant was never informed that he could refuse to make a statement and that any
statement could be used as evidence against him.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The defendant properly could be required to utter the words spoken by the bank robber.
The privilege against self-incrimination extends only to compelled "testimonial" communications; "[t]hus, even
though the act may provide incriminating evidence, a criminal suspect may be compelled...to make a recording
of his voice." United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 34-35 (2000) (citing United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218
(1967)). Thus, Answer A is correct because the defendant did not provide a testimonial statement at the
lineup. 

Answer B is incorrect. This explanation for why the defendant's suppression motion should be denied is
overbroad and therefore incorrect because testimony based on firsthand observation may be suppressed in
certain cases if the testimony derived from an unconstitutional identification procedure. See, e.g., Manson v.
Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977); United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967). 

Answer C is incorrect. Requiring the defendant to utter the words spoken by the bank robber did not violate his
constitutional rights. The privilege against self-incrimination extends only to compelled "testimonial"
communications; "[t]hus, even though the act may provide incriminating evidence, a criminal suspect may be
compelled...to make a recording of his voice." United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 34-35 (2000) (citing
United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967)). 

Answer D is incorrect. Requiring the defendant to utter the words spoken by the bank robber was not a
compelled "testimonial" communication. United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 34-35 (2000) (citing United
States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967)). Accordingly, it was not necessary to provide Miranda warnings, which
are designed to protect the privilege against self-incrimination. See generally Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U.S.
582 (1990).

Question 1312 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A state statute provides as follows: "In all criminal cases, whenever the Constitution permits, the burden of
proof as to a defense claimed by the defendant shall rest on the defendant, and the magnitude of the burden
shall be as great as the Constitution permits." 

The same state defines the crime of forcible rape as follows: "Forcible rape consists of sexual penetration
inflicted on an unconsenting person by means of force or violence. Consent of the victim is a complete defense
to a charge of rape." 

At a defendant's trial for forcible rape, he testified that the alleged victim had consented to having sexual
intercourse with him. 

How should the trial judge instruct the jury regarding the issue of consent? 

A: The burden of proving that the victim consented, by a preponderance of the evidence, rests on the
defendant.
B: The burden of proving that the victim consented, by clear and convincing evidence, rests on the defendant.
C: The burden of proving that the victim consented, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rests on the
defendant.
D: The burden of proving that the victim did not consent, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rests on the
prosecution.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The state statute includes lack of consent as an element of the offense. Accordingly, the
statute cannot shift the burden of proving this element to the defense, by a preponderance of the evidence or
any other standard. Due process "protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in
the definition of the offense of which the defendant is charged." Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197 (1977);
see also Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684 (1975). The burden of proving that the victim did not consent must
rest on the prosecution. Thus, Answer D is correct, and Answers A, B, and C are incorrect.

Question 1323 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A federal grand jury was investigating drug trafficking in the jurisdiction. It subpoenaed a witness to testify, and
the prosecutor advised the witness that he had a Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify if he so chose. The
witness asked that his counsel be allowed to advise him inside the grand jury room, but the prosecutor refused
to allow the attorney inside. The witness, after speaking with his attorney outside the grand jury room, decided
to testify and ended up making self-incriminating statements. 

The witness subsequently was indicted for drug crimes. The indictment was based on the witness's grand jury
testimony and on evidence seized in an unconstitutional search of the witness's home. 

The witness moved to dismiss the indictment. 

Should the court dismiss the indictment? 

A: Yes, because the witness was denied his constitutional right to advice of counsel.
B: Yes, because the indictment was based upon illegally seized evidence.
C: No, because the witness waived his constitutional rights by testifying.
D: No, because the witness had no right to counsel inside the grand jury room and the illegally seized
evidence did not affect the validity of the indictment.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. A grand jury witness does not have a constitutional right to counsel inside a grand jury
room. See Connecticut v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 292 (1999) (citing United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564
(1976)). Thus, Answer A is incorrect. Also, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to federal
grand juries and is not a basis upon which a federal indictment can be dismissed. United States v. Calandra,
414 U.S. 338 (1974). Thus, Answer B is incorrect, and Answer D is correct. 

Answer C is incorrect. The issue here does not turn on waiver, nor does the fact pattern demonstrate a waiver
of any constitutional rights. Rather, wholly apart from any waiver, none of defendant's constitutional rights were
violated, as explained above.

Question 1325 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

United States customs officials received an anonymous tip that heroin would be found inside a distinctively
marked red package mailed from a foreign country to the United States. Pursuant to this tip, United States
customs officers opened the red package and found heroin inside. They then resealed the package and left
the heroin inside it. The FBI was notified and, as agents watched, the package was delivered to the address. 

The FBI then secured a warrant to search the house for the package. About two hours after the package was
delivered, the warrant was executed at the house. The man who opened the door was arrested, and the
agents found the package, unopened, in an upstairs bedroom closet. After seizing the package, the agents
looked through the rest of the house. In a footlocker in the basement, they found a machine gun. 

The man was charged with, among other crimes, unlawful possession of the machine gun. He moved to
suppress its use as evidence. 

Should the court grant the motion to suppress the machine gun? 

A: Yes, because the search exceeded the authority granted by the warrant.
B: Yes, because the initial search by the customs officers was without probable cause.
C: No, because, having found the package, the agents had probable cause to believe more narcotics could be
located in the house and the gun was found in a proper search for narcotics.
D: No, because narcotics dealers are often armed and the search was justified to protect the agents.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The warrant was valid, but its validity was triggered by and limited to the delivered
package. See United States v. Grubbs, 547 U.S. 90 (2006). Accordingly, once the only object of that search
was discovered, the warrant did not authorize a further exploratory search of the house. See Horton v.
California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). Thus, Answer A is correct, and Answer C is incorrect. 

Answer B is incorrect. Probable cause was not required for the customs officers' search of international mail.
See United States v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606 (1977). 

Answer D is incorrect. Officers may conduct a "protective sweep" of a home only if they have reason to believe
others inside the home may pose a danger to them. Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325 (1990). The facts in this
scenario would not seem to justify such a protective sweep, but even assuming a protective sweep was
authorized, Buie limits such a sweep "to a cursory visual inspection of those places in which a person might be
hiding." Thus, even an authorized sweep would not extend to the footlocker.

Question 1331 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

In a city, a number of armed bank robberies were committed near closing time by a masked man wearing a
white hooded sweatshirt and blue sweatpants. Police saw a man wearing a white hooded sweatshirt and blue
sweatpants pacing nervously outside one of the city's banks just before it closed. The police stopped the man
and frisked the outer layers of his clothing for weapons, but found none. They asked the man what he was
doing outside the bank and pointed out that he was wearing clothing similar to clothing worn by the perpetrator
of recent robberies. After pausing for several moments, the man confessed. The police had not provided him
with any Miranda warnings. 

After being charged with the bank robberies, the man moved to suppress his confession. The parties agreed,
and the court properly found, that the police had reasonable suspicion but not probable cause at all times
before the man confessed. 

Should the man's motion to suppress be granted? 

A: Yes, because the confession was the fruit of a Fourth Amendment violation, even though there was no
Miranda violation.
B: Yes, because the confession was the fruit of a Miranda violation, even though there was no Fourth
Amendment violation.
C: Yes, because the confession was the fruit of both a Fourth Amendment violation and a Miranda violation.
D: No, because there was neither a Fourth Amendment violation nor a Miranda violation.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. There was neither a Fourth Amendment violation nor a Miranda violation. There was no
Fourth Amendment violation because the stop, frisk, and questioning were permissible, under Terry v. Ohio,
392 U.S. 1 (1968), based on reasonable suspicion. There was no Miranda violation because warnings are not
required for Terry stops. See Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 439-40 (1984). Therefore, Answer D is
correct, and Answers A, B, and C are incorrect.

Question 1354 - Criminal Law - Inchoate Crimes

 The question was: 

A drug dealer agreed with another individual to purchase heroin from the individual in order to sell it on a city
street corner. Unknown to the drug dealer, the other individual was an undercover police officer whose only
purpose was to arrest distributors of drugs. The drug dealer made a down payment for the heroin and agreed
to pay the remainder after he sold it on the street. As soon as the undercover officer handed over the heroin,
other officers moved in and arrested the dealer. 

The jurisdiction follows the common law approach to conspiracy. 

Could the dealer properly be convicted of conspiring to distribute drugs? 

A: No, because there was no overt act.
B: No, because there was no plurality of agreement.
C: Yes, because neither an overt act nor plurality of agreement is required at common law.
D: Yes, because the dealer believed all the elements of conspiracy were present and cannot take advantage
of a mistake of fact or law.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The dealer cannot be convicted of conspiring to distribute drugs. The common law
definition of conspiracy requires a plurality of agreement to commit a crime, and does not criminalize
"unilateral" conspiracy where only one person actually agreed to commit the crime and the other only feigned
agreement. Here, the drug dealer agreed to buy and distribute the heroin, but the individual--an undercover
police officer--merely feigned an intent to be a part of the crime as part of his undercover operation. Thus,
Answer B is correct. 

Answer A is incorrect. Mere preparation, such as payment for the drugs, would qualify as an overt act for
purposes of conspiracy.  

Answer C is incorrect. Plurality of agreement is required unless it is specifically stated that the jurisdiction
follows the Modern Penal Code's unilateral approach to conspiracy. Because the undercover officer was
feigning his agreement to purchase and sell the heroin, there was no plurality of agreement and thus no
conspiracy. 

Answer D is incorrect. The dealer cannot be convicted here because, as explained above, there was no
plurality of agreement between the dealer and the undercover officer. Accordingly, the dealer could not
properly be convicted for conspiring with an undercover officer.

Question 1358 - Criminal Law - Inchoate Crimes

 The question was: 

A foreign diplomat discovered that a small person could enter a jewelry store by crawling through an air vent.
The diplomat became friendly with a woman in a bar who he believed was small enough to crawl through the
air vent. Without telling her that he was a diplomat, he explained how she could get into the jewelry store. She
agreed to help him burglarize the store. Someone overheard their conversation and reported it to the police.
Shortly thereafter, the police arrested the diplomat and the woman. Both were charged with conspiracy to
commit burglary. 

Before trial, the diplomat moved to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that he was entitled to
diplomatic immunity. The court granted his motion. The woman then moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge
against her. 

The jurisdiction has adopted the Model Penal Code version of conspiracy. 

Should the woman's motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her be granted? 

A: No, because the diplomat's defense does not negate any element of the crime.
B: No, because the woman was not aware of the diplomat's status.
C: Yes, because a conspiracy requires two guilty participants.
D: Yes, because but for the diplomat's conduct, no conspiracy would have occurred.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Model Penal Code section 5.03(1), by defining conspiracy as requiring agreement by the
defendant but not by two or more persons, adopts a unilateral interpretation of conspiracy. The defendant can
be convicted of conspiracy regardless of whether the other parties have all been acquitted or were only
feigning agreement. In addition, many jurisdictions that require a bilateral conspiracy still allow conviction if one
of the co-conspirators agreed to the crime but cannot be convicted based on lack of capacity or some other
defense personal to the co-conspirator. Thus, Answer A is correct because the diplomat's defense will not
negate the fact that the woman agreed to commit burglary. Answer C is incorrect because, as stated above,
under the Model Penal Code's unilateral approach to conspiracy, a defendant may be found guilty of
conspiracy even if the other conspirators are all acquitted or assert valid personal defenses. 

Answer B is incorrect. The woman would not be entitled to dismissal, even if she knew of the diplomat's status,
because the diplomat's capacity to be convicted of the crime would be irrelevant under a jurisdiction that
adopted a unilateral view of conspiracy.  

Answer D is incorrect. The woman properly can be convicted because, regardless of the diplomat's immunity,
she agreed to commit a crime. The fact that the diplomat's conduct was a but-for cause of the conspiracy is
irrelevant because the diplomat was not a government agent, and in any event there is no basis for finding that
he entrapped her.

Question 1360 - Criminal Law - Other Crimes

 The question was: 

A woman told a man to go into her friend's unlocked barn and retrieve an expensive black saddle that she said
she had loaned to the friend. The man went to the friend's barn, opened the door, found a black saddle, and
took it back to the woman's house. The friend had in fact not borrowed a saddle from the woman, and when
the friend discovered her black saddle missing, she suspected that the woman was the thief. The friend used a
screwdriver to break into the woman's house to find the saddle. Upon discovering the saddle on the woman's
table, the friend took it back and called the police. 

The jurisdiction follows the common law, except that burglary covers structures in addition to dwellings and the
nighttime element has been eliminated. 

Which, if any, of these individuals is guilty of burglary? 

A: All of them.
B: Only the friend.
C: Only the man.
D: Only the woman.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. At common law, burglary is defined as the breaking and entering of a dwelling of another
at nighttime with the intent to commit a felony therein. Here, the facts state that this jurisdiction has eliminated
the nighttime element and has expanded its definition of burglary to cover structures in addition to dwellings.
The felony in this case is larceny. Larceny is the taking and carrying away of tangible personal property of
another by trespass with intent to permanently deprive that person of her interest in the property. Furthermore,
larceny is a specific intent crime, meaning that the defendant had to engage in the specifically proscribed
conduct in order to be guilty of the crime. 

The man did not have the requisite criminal intent to commit larceny. Persons taking property in the honest but
mistaken belief that the property belongs to someone who has authorized them to take it lack the intent to steal
required for larceny. Therefore, he did not intend to commit a felony inside the barn and cannot be guilty of
burglary. Thus, Answers A and C are incorrect. Furthermore, the friend did not have the requisite criminal
intent. Persons taking back their own property lack the intent to steal required for larceny. Therefore, he did not
intend to commit a felony inside the barn and cannot be guilty of burglary. Thus, Answer B is incorrect. Only
the woman had the requisite criminal intent. She knew that the saddle did not belong to her, and specifically
intended and caused the man to steal the saddle on her behalf. Thus, Answer D is correct.

Question 1363 - Criminal Law - Inchoate Crimes

 The question was: 

A woman promised to pay $10,000 to a hit man if he would kill her neighbor in any manner that could not be
traced to her. The hit man bought a gun and watched the neighbor's house for an opportunity to shoot him.
One evening, unaware of the hit man's presence, the neighbor tripped as he was walking toward his house,
falling and hitting his head against the front steps. Believing that the neighbor was unconscious, the hit man
ran over to him and shot him twice in the chest. 

When the woman learned of the neighbor's death, she paid the hit man $10,000. A medical examiner
determined that the neighbor was already dead when the hit man shot him. 

The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. 

What is the most serious crime for which the woman properly could be convicted? 

A: Murder.
B: Attempted murder.
C: Conspiracy.
D: Solicitation.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. The victim must
actually die as a result of the defendant's conduct, or else a murder did not occur. The woman cannot be guilty
of murder, because the hit man did not in fact cause the neighbor's death. However, she can be convicted of
attempted murder. An attempt is an act done with the intent to commit a crime where the act falls short of the
full commission of the crime. Here, the woman hired a hit man to murder the neighbor, and all of the requisite
acts for the commission of a murder occurred except that the hit man did not cause the neighbor's death.
Thus, the woman is guilty of attempted murder. Accordingly, neither conspiracy nor solicitation is the most
serious crime of which she could be convicted. Thus, Answer B is correct, and Answers A, C, and D are
incorrect.

Question 1372 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

The police suspected a woman of growing marijuana in her private residence. Narcotics officers went to her
neighborhood in the middle of the night. Nothing unlawful could be seen from the street, so the officers walked
into the neighbors' yard and looked through the woman's kitchen window, which had neither drapes nor
shades. The officers observed what appeared to be marijuana plants being cultivated under grow lights in the
kitchen. Using this information, the officers obtained a search warrant. The execution of that warrant netted
numerous marijuana plants. 

The woman was charged with possession of marijuana. She moved to suppress the marijuana plants
recovered when the warrant was executed, claiming that the evidence supporting the warrant was obtained
through a search that violated the Fourth Amendment. 

Should the marijuana plants be suppressed? 

A: No, because regardless of the lawfulness of the police conduct beforehand, they did obtain a warrant to
search the woman's home.
B: No, because the woman could have no reasonable expectation of privacy concerning activities that she
exposed to the view of her neighbors.
C: Yes, because the officers' clandestine observation of the plants violated the woman's reasonable
expectation of privacy concerning activities occurring in her home.
D: Yes, because no unlawful activities could be observed by the officers from any public vantage point.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. Evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant would have to be suppressed if the warrant
was obtained based on information discovered pursuant to an illegal search, if the search was in fact illegal.
See Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533 (1988). Thus, Answer A is incorrect. 

Here, the marijuana plants were in plain view of the neighbors. The woman has no standing to complain of any
police trespass on the neighbors' property. See Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). Thus, Answer B is
correct, and Answers C and D are incorrect.

Question 1390 - Criminal Law - Homicide

 The question was: 

A woman offered to pay her friend one-third of the stolen proceeds if the friend would drive the getaway car to
be used in a bank robbery. The friend agreed but made the woman promise not to hurt anyone during the
robbery. 

The woman then drove to a sporting goods store, where she explained to the store owner that she needed a
small firearm for use in a bank robbery. The store owner responded that he would charge extra because the
woman was so unwise as to confide her unlawful plans for using the weapon, and he sold her a handgun at
four times the regular price. 

During the robbery, the woman used the gun to threaten a bank teller into handing over the money. The gun
discharged by accident and killed a bank customer. 

At common law, who in addition to the woman could properly be convicted of murder in the death of the
customer? 

A: Both the friend and the store owner.
B: Neither the friend nor the store owner.
C: Only the friend.
D: Only the store owner.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The friend is responsible for the unintended but reasonably foreseeable acts of her
co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy. When the friend agreed to drive the getaway vehicle after a
bank robbery, it was foreseeable that the woman would use a weapon and end up killing someone during the
robbery. The store owner's sale of the gun, combined with his knowledge of the woman's plan to use it in a
crime and his financial benefit from that knowledge, should suffice to impose accomplice liability. Selling the
gun at a higher price because of the woman's purpose is a high enough stake in the robbery to constitute
intent to aid her. For those reasons, Answer B is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because the store owner
could also be convicted of the murder. Answer D is incorrect because the friend could also be convicted of the
murder.

Question 1397 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A state grand jury investigating a murder learned that the key suspect might have kept a diary. The grand jury
issued a subpoena duces tecum requiring the suspect to produce any diary. The subpoena made clear that
the grand jury was seeking only the diary and not any testimony from the suspect. The suspect refused to
produce the diary, citing the privilege against self-incrimination. 

Under what circumstances, if any, could the grand jury compel production of the diary over the suspect's Fifth
Amendment privilege? 

A: It may compel production without granting immunity because the suspect was not compelled to write a
diary.
B: It may compel production only if the suspect is granted use and derivative use immunity from the act of
production.
C: It may compel production only if the suspect is granted transactional immunity.
D: It may not compel production of a private diary under any circumstances.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination protects only testimonial or
communicative evidence, and not real or physical evidence. Therefore, it protects acts of production that would
have testimonial significance by authenticating documents. Thus, Answer A is incorrect. 

However, a criminal defendant may be compelled to produce documents that have testimonial significance if
immunity is granted to the defendant. There are two kinds of immunity that may be granted. The broader form
of immunity is "transactional immunity." Transactional immunity completely protects the witness from future
prosecution for crimes related to his or her testimony. "Use and derivative use" immunity is narrower--it
prevents the prosecution only from using the witness's own testimony or any evidence derived from the
testimony against the witness. However, should the prosecutor acquire evidence substantiating the supposed
crime--independently of the witness's testimony--the witness may then be prosecuted for the same. 

Here, Answer B is correct because use and derivative use immunity sufficiently protects the constitutional
privilege against self-incrimination in this situation. Thus, Answer C is incorrect because the prosecution does
not need to grant the suspect transactional immunity--use and derivative use immunity sufficiently protects the
constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. Answer D is incorrect because the suspect's privilege against
self-incrimination may be overcome if the suspect is granted use and derivative use immunity.

Question 1399 - Criminal Law - Homicide

 The question was: 

A man was angered after he was unexpectedly laid off from his longtime job as a factory assembly worker.
The next day, he returned to the factory floor and indiscriminately fired shotgun rounds in the air. The man
later testified, without contradiction, that he had not intended to kill anyone but simply sought to exact revenge
on the factory's owners by shutting down operations for the day. Unfortunately, one of the bullets ricocheted off
the wall and killed the man's best friend. 

The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. 

On these facts, what is the most serious offense for which the man properly could be convicted? 

A: Murder.
B: Voluntary manslaughter.
C: Involuntary manslaughter.
D: Assault.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The most serious offense for which the man could properly be convicted of is murder. At
common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought.
Malice aforethought exists where the defendant acted with one of the following mental states: (i) intent to kill,
(ii) intent to inflict great bodily injury, (iii)reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life (acting
with a "depraved heart"), or (iv) intent to commit a felony (felony murder). Here, even though the man lacked
specific intent to kill, the man's conduct created such a high risk of death and was so devoid of social utility that
he could be found to have acted with a "depraved heart." The man's actions also caused the death of his
friend. Thus, Answer A is correct.  

Answer B is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter is a killing that would otherwise be murder but for the existence
of an adequate provocation. Here, the man could not properly be convicted of voluntary manslaughter because
there was no adequate provocation for his conduct, Furthermore, this answer is incorrect because he could be
convicted of the more serious offense of depraved heart murder. br /> 
Answer C is incorrect. It is true that the man could properly be convicted of involuntary manslaughter but this
answer is incorrect because he could also be convicted of the more serious offense of depraved heart murder. 

Answer D is incorrect. The man could properly be convicted of assault in some jurisdictions but this answer is
incorrect because he could also be convicted of the more serious offense of depraved heart murder.

Question 1416 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A store owner whose jewelry store had recently been robbed was shown by a police detective a photograph of
the defendant, who previously had committed other similar crimes. The store owner examined the photograph
and then asked the detective whether the police believed that the man pictured was the robber. After the
detective said, "We're pretty sure," the store owner stated that the man in the photograph was the one who
had robbed her. 

The defendant was indicted for the robbery. His counsel moved to suppress any trial testimony by the store
owner identifying the defendant as the robber. 

Should the court grant the motion and suppress the store owner's trial testimony identifying the defendant as
the robber? 

A: No, because suppression of in-court testimony is not a proper remedy, even though the out-of-court
identification was improper.
B: No, because the out-of-court identification was not improper.
C: Yes, because the improper out-of-court identification has necessarily tainted any in-court identification.
D: Yes, unless the prosecution demonstrates that the in-court identification is reliable.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. An out-of-court identification procedure is improper if it is unnecessarily suggestive, which
this procedure (involving just one photograph and the detective's leading statement) plainly was. Thus, Answer
B is incorrect because the out-of-court identification was improper. Answer A is incorrect because an improper
out-of-court identification procedure may require suppression of in-court testimony if it produces a substantial
likelihood of irreparable misidentification. However, even if an out-of-court identification procedure is
unnecessarily suggestive, which this one plainly was, suppression of in-court testimony is not required if the
eyewitness’s identification is shown to be reliable under a multi-factor inquiry. Answer C is incorrect because it
may be possible to establish the reliability of the eyewitness's testimony without regard to the tainted
out-of-court identification. Thus, Answer D is correct.

Question 1426 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with attempted murder. At the preliminary hearing, the presiding judge heard the
testimony of four prosecution witnesses and found that the prosecution had failed to establish probable cause
that the defendant had committed any offense. Accordingly, he dismissed the charge. 

The prosecutor then called the same four witnesses before a grand jury. The grand jury indicted the same
defendant for attempted murder. 

The defendant has moved to quash the indictment on the ground of double jeopardy. 

How should the court proceed? 

A: Grant the motion, because the dismissal of the first charge on the merits, whether correct or incorrect, bars
any further prosecution.
B: Grant the motion, unless the prosecution has evidence that was not presented in the first case.
C: Deny the motion, because the defendant has not yet been in jeopardy of conviction on the attempted
murder charge.
D: Deny the motion, because the protection of the double jeopardy clause does not come into play until there
has been a conviction or an acquittal.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. For double jeopardy purposes, jeopardy does not attach until trial, when the jury is sworn
in (or, in a bench trial, when the first witness is sworn in). Thus, Answer C is correct. The dismissal after a
preliminary hearing had no double jeopardy consequences because, as stated above, jeopardy only attaches
when the jury is sworn in, or in a bench trial, the first witness is sworn in. Thus, Answer A and Answer B are
incorrect. 

Answer D is incorrect. While jeopardy does not attach until trial, actions short of a conviction or acquittal (for
example, a mistrial) may bar retrial on double jeopardy grounds.

Question 1435 - Criminal Law - Inchoate Crimes

 The question was: 

A man had spent the evening drinking at a local bar and was weaving down the street on his way home,
singing. Suddenly, a person wearing a cartoon character mask jumped out from an alley, pointed his gun at
the man, and snarled, "This is loaded, buddy, and I don't mind using it. Hand over your cash pronto." The man
was so drunk that he failed to understand what was going on and started to howl with laughter at the sight of
the cartoon mask. Surprised and rattled by the man's reaction, the masked gunman fled. The man soon
recovered his composure and staggered home safely. 

The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. 

What is the most serious crime of which the masked gunman may properly be charged and convicted? 

A: Attempted robbery.
B: Attempted battery.
C: Attempted larceny.
D: No crime.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The masked gunman could properly be convicted of attempted robbery because, though
unsuccessful, he committed an act intended to take the man's property through force or fear. The confluence
of the act and intent would suffice to constitute an attempt under any of the various approaches to attempt
liability. 

Even assuming that the masked gunman could also be convicted of attempted battery or attempted larceny,
neither crime is the most serious crime of which he could properly be convicted. As stated above, the most
serious crime the masked gunman could be convicted of is attempted robbery. Thus, Answer B and Answer C
are incorrect. Furthermore, Answer D is incorrect because, as stated above, the masked gunman could be
convicted of attempted robbery.

Question 1450 - Criminal Law - General Principles

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with battery, defined as at common law. At trial, an expert witness testified for the
defense that the defendant, an athlete, was under the influence of a performance-enhancing drug at the time
he committed the battery and that he would not have done so had he not been so influenced. The defendant
asked for an instruction to the effect that if the jury believed that he was influenced by the drug at the time of
the crime and would not have committed it otherwise, it had to acquit him. 

Which of the following circumstances would most aid the defendant's argument in favor of such an
instruction? 

A: Evidence that the defendant is addicted to this drug and has an overwhelming urge to consume it.
B: Evidence that the defendant's coach, who gave him the drug, told him it was only an aspirin.
C: Evidence that the victim of the assault taunted the defendant about his use of the drug immediately before
the assault.
D: Expert testimony that a reasonable person, on consuming this drug, may experience uncontrollable rages.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. Battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another resulting in either an
offensive touching or bodily injury. Battery is also a general intent crime. "General intent" is an awareness of all
the factors constituting the crime. Voluntary intoxication is not a valid defense to a general intent crime. Thus,
the most helpful fact supporting an intoxication defense would be evidence that the intoxication was
involuntary, which could be shown by evidence demonstrating that the defendant was tricked into taking a
substance that he did not know was an intoxicant. Answer B is correct. 

As stated above, voluntary intoxication would not be a defense to the crime of battery, and the fact that a
defendant was addicted to a drug does not make intoxication with that drug involuntary for purposes of the
criminal law. Thus, Answer A is incorrect. 

Nor would the victim's taunting constitute a valid defense. The victim's taunting would not support an
intoxication instruction, which would be proper only if there was evidence showing that the intoxication was
involuntary. Thus, Answer C is incorrect. 

Answer D is incorrect. The expert testimony would not support an instruction because voluntary intoxication,
regardless of the intoxicant's effects, is not a defense to the crime of battery.

Question 1460 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

Federal agents had a hunch that a local man was engaged in illegal gambling activities. An agent decided to
enter the man's house while he was not at home and see what he could find. The agent discovered an
envelope containing $5,000 in cash and an executive's business card. Returning the envelope to its place, the
agent located and interviewed the executive, who admitted that he had paid the man $5,000 to settle a
gambling debt; the executive also disclosed that the man regularly took illegal bets from the executive and
several of his acquaintances. The agent then interviewed the acquaintances, who confirmed what the
executive had told him. The agent then arranged to be introduced to the man at a local bar. After a few drinks,
the man, unaware of the agent's identity, boasted that he was one of the biggest bookmakers in the state. 

The agent testified to all of his investigation's discoveries before a grand jury, which returned an indictment
against the man for illegal gambling activities, based solely on the agent's testimony. The man's attorney then
filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it rested on violations of the man's constitutional rights.  

Should the court grant the motion? 

A: No, because dismissal of the indictment is not the appropriate remedy.
B: Yes, because much of the agent's testimony before the grand jury was inadmissible hearsay.
C: Yes, because of the agent's unlawful search of the man's home.
D: Yes, because of the agent's violation of the man's right to counsel.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Dismissal of the indictment would not be warranted because a grand jury is entitled to
consider hearsay and is not limited by the exclusionary rule. Furthermore, courts will not look behind a facially
sufficient indictment to review the sufficiency of the grand jury's probable cause determination. Thus, Answer A
is correct and Answer B is incorrect. 

Answer C is incorrect. The Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not extend to grand juries or provide a
basis for dismissing a facially valid indictment. 

Answer D is incorrect. There was no violation of any right to counsel that could justify dismissal of the
indictment. This was not a custodial interrogation, so Miranda does not attach. Moreover, the man's
statements to the agent were voluntary.

Question 1481 - Criminal Law - General Principles

 The question was: 

A state statute provides: "Aggravated robbery of the elderly consists of robbery committed against a victim who
is 65 years of age or older." Another state statute provides that when a criminal statute does not designate a
necessary mental state, the mental state required is recklessness. A third state statute provides that a person
acts recklessly if the person "consciously disregards a substantial and unjustified risk that the material element
exists or will result from the person's conduct."  

The evidence at a criminal trial showed that the defendant robbed a 66-year-old man outside a senior citizens'
center. The defendant testified truthfully that the robbery had occurred on a dark night, that she had had no
idea how old the victim was and had not cared how old the victim was, and that she had intended to rob
whomever she encountered.  

Could the defendant properly be convicted of aggravated robbery of the elderly? 

A: No, because the only evidence on the issue showed that the defendant did not know, nor could she
reasonably have known, the victim's age.
B: No, because there was no evidence of a substantial risk that the victim was age 65 or older.
C: Yes, because the evidence was clear that the victim was 66 years old, and the statute is designed to
protect the elderly.
D: Yes, because the jury could find that there was no justification for the defendant's conduct and that she was
willing to take the risk that the victim was age 65 or older.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The mens rea or scienter standard for a conviction under the statute is recklessness,
defined as disregard of a substantial and unjustified risk. Given the totality of the circumstances--including the
crime's location, the victim's age, and the defendant's intent and unjustifiable actions--a jury could properly
conclude that the defendant had acted with reckless disregard of the victim's age. Thus, Answer D is correct,
and Answers A and B are incorrect. 

Answer C is incorrect. The result in this response is correct, but the reasoning is wrong. While a jury could
properly convict the defendant, it could do so only after finding that she acted with the requisite mens rea or
scienter. Because the scienter standard for a conviction under the statute is recklessness as to the victim's
age, it is not sufficient that the victim in fact was at least 65 years old or that the statute was intended to protect
the elderly.

Question 1495 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

Police responded to a call that shots had been heard coming from a certain house. Upon arriving at the house,
the police looked through a window and saw a man lying on the living room floor. The police opened the front
door, which was not locked, and found that the man had recently been shot in the back and was unconscious.
An ambulance was called. While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if
anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of
what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the
contents were cocaine.  

After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the
house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a
drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it.  

Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the
cocaine and the marijuana. The young woman has filed a motion to suppress the use of both as evidence on
the ground that the entry into the house and the searches were made without a warrant.  

How should the court decide the young woman's motion? 

A: Grant it as to the cocaine, but deny it as to the marijuana.
B: Deny it as to the cocaine, but grant it as to the marijuana.
C: Grant it as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.
D: Deny it as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The police entry of the home was reasonable to provide aid to a man in need of
emergency assistance. Once they were inside the home, the police officers could properly seize contraband in
plain view but could not conduct an exploratory search for contraband. Accordingly, the police properly seized
the cocaine (which was in plain view) but not the marijuana (which was the fruit of an improper, warrantless
search). The court should deny the woman's motion to suppress the cocaine because it was lawfully seized
under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. However, the court should grant the woman's
motion to suppress the marijuana because it was unlawfully seized during an improper, warrantless search of

Question 1503 - Criminal Law - General Principles

 The question was: 

A state statute provides: "The sale of an alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 is a
misdemeanor."  

A woman who was 20 years old, but who looked older and who had a very convincing fake driver's license
indicating that she was 24, entered a convenience store, picked up a six-pack of beer, and placed the beer on
the counter. The store clerk, after examining the driver's license, rang up the purchase.  

Both the clerk and the store owner have been charged with violating the state statute.  

If the court finds both the clerk and the store owner guilty, what standard of liability must the court have
interpreted the statute to impose? 

A: Strict liability only.
B: Vicarious liability only.
C: Both strict and vicarious liability.
D: Either strict or vicarious liability.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The court must have applied strict liability to convict the clerk (who did not act knowingly, and
arguably not even negligently), but must have applied vicarious liability to convict the store owner for the sale
by the clerk.  

B is incorrect. The court must have applied vicarious liability to convict the store owner for the sale by the
clerk, but must have applied strict liability to convict the clerk (who did not act knowingly, and arguably not
even negligently).  

C is correct. The court must have applied strict liability to convict the clerk (who did not act knowingly, and
arguably not even negligently) and vicarious liability to convict the store owner for the sale by the clerk.  

D is incorrect. The court must have applied strict liability to convict the clerk (who did not act knowingly, and
arguably not even negligently) and vicarious liability to convict the store owner for the sale by the clerk.

Question 1510 - Criminal Law - General Principles

 The question was: 

A woman charged with murder has entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. At her trial, in which the
questions of guilt and sanity are being tried together, the evidence shows that the woman stalked the victim for
several hours before following him to an isolated hiking trail where she shot and killed him. Expert witnesses
for the defense have testified that the woman knew that killing was illegal and wrong, but that she suffered
from a serious mental illness that left her in the grip of a powerful and irresistible compulsion to kill the victim.  

If the jury believes the testimony of the defense experts, under what circumstances could the jury properly
acquit the woman of murder? 

A: Only if the jurisdiction follows the M'Naghten test for insanity.
B: Only if the jurisdiction follows the ALI Model Penal Code test for insanity.
C: If the jurisdiction follows either the M'Naghten or the ALI Model Penal Code test for insanity.
D: Even if the jurisdiction has abolished the insanity defense.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The jury could not find the woman to be legally insane under the M'Naghten test, which requires
either that she did not know the nature and quality of the act she was committing or that she did not know the
difference between right and wrong.  

B is correct. The jury could find the woman to be legally insane under the ALI Model Penal Code test, because
she could not conform her conduct to the requirements of the law.  

C is incorrect. The jury could not find the woman to be legally insane under the M'Naghten test, which requires
either that she did not know the nature and quality of the act she was committing or that she did not know the
difference between right and wrong. The jury could find the woman to be legally insane under the ALI Model
Penal Code test, because she could not conform her conduct to the requirements of the law.  

D is incorrect. The woman committed all the elements of murder and can be excused from responsibility only if
she meets a recognized defense of insanity.

Question 1514 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A valid warrant was issued for a woman's arrest. The police learned that a person with the woman's name and
physical description lived at a particular address. When police officers went to that address, the house
appeared to be unoccupied: the windows and doors were boarded up with plywood, and the lawn had not
been mowed for a long time. A neighbor confirmed that the house belonged to the woman but said that the
woman had not been there for several months.  

The officers knocked repeatedly on the front door and shouted, "Police! Open up!" Receiving no response,
they tore the plywood off the door, smashed through the door with a sledgehammer, and entered the house.
They found no one inside, but they did find an illegal sawed-off shotgun. Upon her return to the house a few
weeks later, the woman was charged with unlawful possession of the shotgun.  

The woman has moved to suppress the use of the shotgun as evidence at her trial.  

Should the court grant the motion? 

A: No, because the officers acted in good faith under the authority of a valid warrant.
B: No, because the officers did not violate any legitimate expectation of privacy in the house since the woman
had abandoned it.
C: Yes, because the officers entered the house by means of excessive force.
D: Yes, because the officers had no reason to believe that the woman was in the house.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Under the Fourth Amendment, the arrest warrant would have authorized forcible entry only if the
officers had reason to believe that the woman was at home at the time of the entry. Here, the officers knew
that the woman was not at home.  

B is incorrect. The facts here are legally insufficient to suggest that the woman had abandoned any reasonable
expectation of privacy in the house.  

C is incorrect. Under the Fourth Amendment, the arrest warrant would have authorized forcible entry if the
officers had reason to believe that the woman was at home at the time of the entry. Here, however, the officers
knew that the woman was not at home.  

D is correct. Under the Fourth Amendment, the arrest warrant would have authorized forcible entry only if the
officers had reason to believe that the woman was at home at the time of the entry. Here, the officers knew
that the woman was not at home.

appeared to be unoccupied: the windows and doors were boarded up with plywood, and the lawn had not
been mowed for a long time. A neighbor confirmed that the house belonged to the woman but said that the
woman had not been there for several months.  

The officers knocked repeatedly on the front door and shouted, "Police! Open up!" Receiving no response,
they tore the plywood off the door, smashed through the door with a sledgehammer, and entered the house.
They found no one inside, but they did find an illegal sawed-off shotgun. Upon her return to the house a few
weeks later, the woman was charged with unlawful possession of the shotgun.  

The woman has moved to suppress the use of the shotgun as evidence at her trial.  

Should the court grant the motion? 

A: No, because the officers acted in good faith under the authority of a valid warrant.
B: No, because the officers did not violate any legitimate expectation of privacy in the house since the woman
had abandoned it.
C: Yes, because the officers entered the house by means of excessive force.
D: Yes, because the officers had no reason to believe that the woman was in the house.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Under the Fourth Amendment, the arrest warrant would have authorized forcible entry only if the
officers had reason to believe that the woman was at home at the time of the entry. Here, the officers knew
that the woman was not at home.  

B is incorrect. The facts here are legally insufficient to suggest that the woman had abandoned any reasonable
expectation of privacy in the house.  

C is incorrect. Under the Fourth Amendment, the arrest warrant would have authorized forcible entry if the
officers had reason to believe that the woman was at home at the time of the entry. Here, however, the officers
knew that the woman was not at home.  

D is correct. Under the Fourth Amendment, the arrest warrant would have authorized forcible entry only if the
officers had reason to believe that the woman was at home at the time of the entry. Here, the officers knew
that the woman was not at home.

Question 1521 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A woman was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury. When she arrived, she was taken into the grand jury
room to be questioned. She answered preliminary questions about her name and address. She was then
asked where she had been at a certain time on a specified night when a murder had occurred. Before
answering the question, the woman said that she wanted to consult her attorney, who was waiting outside the
grand jury room, and she was allowed to do so. When she returned to the grand jury room, she stated that she
refused to answer the question because the answer might incriminate her.  

The prosecutor believes that the woman's nephew committed the murder. The nephew has said that he was
with the woman at the time of the murder, and the prosecutor believes that this alibi is false. The prosecutor
does not believe that the woman is guilty of the murder, either as a principal or as an accomplice, although he
does believe that the woman may be guilty of other crimes. The prosecutor wants to compel the woman to
answer the question by whatever means will result in the least harm to the prosecution's case.  

Which of the following steps should the prosecutor take to get the woman to answer the question? 

A: Request the grand jury to order the woman to answer the question.
B: Ask the woman's attorney to explain to the woman that the rules of evidence do not apply in grand jury
proceedings, and to advise her that she cannot refuse to testify.
C: Prepare the documents necessary to grant the woman immunity from any future use against her of her
grand jury testimony or any evidence derived from it.
D: Prepare the documents necessary to grant the woman immunity from any future prosecution for any crime
she might disclose in the course of her testimony.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The woman cannot be compelled to provide potentially incriminating testimony unless she is
granted use and derivative-use immunity.  

B is incorrect. While the rules of evidence do not apply before grand juries, a witness cannot be compelled to
provide potentially incriminating testimony unless the witness is granted use and derivative-use immunity.  

C is correct. A witness cannot be compelled to provide potentially incriminating testimony unless the witness is
granted use and derivative-use immunity.  

D is incorrect. A witness cannot be compelled to provide potentially incriminating testimony unless the witness
is granted use and derivative-use immunity, but the witness need not be granted transactional immunity.

Question 1528 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A defendant was validly arrested for the murder of a store clerk and was taken to a police station where he
was given Miranda warnings. When an interrogator asked the defendant, "Do you understand your Miranda
rights, and are you willing to give up those rights and talk to us?" the defendant replied, "Yes." When asked,
"Did you kill the clerk?" the defendant replied, "No." When asked, "Where were you on the day the clerk was
killed?" the defendant replied, "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer." The interrogator asked, "Are you sure?" and
the defendant replied, "I'm not sure." The interrogator then asked, "Why would you want to talk with a lawyer?"
and the defendant replied, "Because I killed the clerk. It was an accident, and I think I need a lawyer to defend
me." At that point all interrogation ceased. Later, the defendant was formally charged with murdering the clerk.

The defendant has moved to suppress evidence of his statement "I killed the clerk" on the ground that this
statement was elicited in violation of his Miranda rights.  

Should the defendant's motion be granted? 

A: No, because although the defendant effectively asserted the right to counsel, the question "Why would you
want to talk with a lawyer?" did not constitute custodial interrogation.
B: No, because the defendant did not effectively assert the right to counsel, and his conduct prior to making
the statement constituted a valid waiver of his Miranda rights.
C: Yes, because although the defendant did not effectively assert the right to counsel, his conduct prior to
making the statement did not constitute a valid waiver of his Miranda rights.
D: Yes, because the defendant effectively asserted the right to counsel, and the question "Why would you
want to talk with a lawyer?" constituted custodial interrogation.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The defendant did not effectively assert his right to counsel, because such an assertion must be
unambiguous. The defendant's statement "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer" is not an unambiguous request for
counsel.  

B is correct. The defendant did not effectively assert his right to counsel, because such an assertion must be
unambiguous. The defendant's statement "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer" is not an unambiguous request for
counsel. In addition, the defendant had unequivocally waived his Miranda rights prior to making this statement.

C is incorrect. The defendant unequivocally waived his Miranda rights, and his statement "Maybe I should talk
to a lawyer" did not affect the validity of that waiver.  

D is incorrect. The defendant did not effectively assert his right to counsel, because such an assertion must be
unambiguous. The defendant's statement "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer" is not an unambiguous request for
counsel.

Question 1531 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

Two defendants were being tried together in federal court for bank robbery. The prosecutor sought to introduce
testimony from the first defendant's prison cellmate. The cellmate would testify that the first defendant had
admitted to the cellmate that he and the second defendant had robbed the bank. The prosecutor asked the
court to instruct the jury that the cellmate's testimony could be considered only against the first defendant.  

Can the cellmate's testimony be admitted in a joint trial over the second defendant's objection? 

A: No, because the first defendant made the statement without Miranda warnings.
B: No, because the limiting instruction cannot ensure that the jury will not consider the testimony in its
deliberations regarding the second defendant.
C: Yes, because the first defendant's statement was a declaration against penal interest.
D: Yes, because the limiting instruction sufficiently protects the second defendant.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Miranda warnings were not required, because the first defendant was not compelled by a known
law enforcement agent to make the statement, and in any event the second defendant could not assert
Miranda rights belonging to the first defendant.  

B is correct. The limiting instruction is constitutionally insufficient to avoid the risk that the jury will consider the
incriminating statement against the second defendant, who has no opportunity at trial to confront the first
defendant.  

C is incorrect. The first defendant's statement incriminating the second defendant could not, under the Sixth
Amendment confrontation clause, be considered against the second defendant on a theory that it constitutes a
declaration against penal interest.  

D is incorrect. The limiting instruction is constitutionally insufficient to avoid the risk that the jury will consider
the incriminating statement against the second defendant, who has no opportunity at trial to confront the first
defendant.

B is correct. The limiting instruction is constitutionally insufficient to avoid the risk that the jury will consider the
incriminating statement against the second defendant, who has no opportunity at trial to confront the first
defendant.  

C is incorrect. The first defendant's statement incriminating the second defendant could not, under the Sixth
Amendment confrontation clause, be considered against the second defendant on a theory that it constitutes a
declaration against penal interest.  

D is incorrect. The limiting instruction is constitutionally insufficient to avoid the risk that the jury will consider
the incriminating statement against the second defendant, who has no opportunity at trial to confront the first
defendant.

Question 1531 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

Two defendants were being tried together in federal court for bank robbery. The prosecutor sought to introduce
testimony from the first defendant's prison cellmate. The cellmate would testify that the first defendant had
admitted to the cellmate that he and the second defendant had robbed the bank. The prosecutor asked the
court to instruct the jury that the cellmate's testimony could be considered only against the first defendant.  

Can the cellmate's testimony be admitted in a joint trial over the second defendant's objection? 

A: No, because the first defendant made the statement without Miranda warnings.
B: No, because the limiting instruction cannot ensure that the jury will not consider the testimony in its
deliberations regarding the second defendant.
C: Yes, because the first defendant's statement was a declaration against penal interest.
D: Yes, because the limiting instruction sufficiently protects the second defendant.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Miranda warnings were not required, because the first defendant was not compelled by a known
law enforcement agent to make the statement, and in any event the second defendant could not assert
Miranda rights belonging to the first defendant.  

B is correct. The limiting instruction is constitutionally insufficient to avoid the risk that the jury will consider the
incriminating statement against the second defendant, who has no opportunity at trial to confront the first
defendant.  

C is incorrect. The first defendant's statement incriminating the second defendant could not, under the Sixth
Amendment confrontation clause, be considered against the second defendant on a theory that it constitutes a
declaration against penal interest.  

D is incorrect. The limiting instruction is constitutionally insufficient to avoid the risk that the jury will consider
the incriminating statement against the second defendant, who has no opportunity at trial to confront the first

Question 1534 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

A prosecutor presented to a federal grand jury the testimony of a witness in order to secure a defendant's
indictment for theft of government property. The prosecutor did not disclose to the grand jury that the witness
had been convicted four years earlier of perjury. The grand jury returned an indictment, and the defendant
pleaded not guilty.  

Shortly thereafter, the prosecutor took the case to trial, calling the witness to testify before the jury. The
prosecutor did not disclose the witness's prior perjury conviction until the defense was preparing to rest.
Defense counsel immediately moved for a mistrial, which the court denied. Instead, the court allowed the
defense to recall the witness for the purpose of impeaching him with this conviction, but the witness could not
be located. The court then allowed the defense to introduce documentary evidence of the witness's criminal
record to the jury before resting its case. The jury convicted the defendant.  

The defendant has moved for a new trial, arguing that the prosecutor's failure to disclose the witness's prior
conviction in a timely manner violated the defendant's right to due process of law.  

If the court grants the defendant's motion, what will be the most likely reason? 

A: The defendant was unable to cross-examine the witness about the conviction.
B: The prosecutor failed to inform the grand jury of the witness's conviction.
C: The court found it reasonably probable that the defendant would have been acquitted had the defense had
timely access to the information about the witness's conviction.
D: The court found that the prosecutor had deliberately delayed disclosing the witness's conviction to obtain a
strategic advantage.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The court did not limit the defendant's right to cross-examine the witness. Rather, the
constitutional violation, if any, was the prosecutor's untimely disclosure of impeachment information that would
have created a reasonable probability of a different outcome had it been disclosed earlier.  

B is incorrect. The prosecutor is not required to present a grand jury with evidence favorable to a defendant.
Rather, the constitutional violation, if any, was the prosecutor's untimely disclosure of impeachment
information that would have created a reasonable probability of a different outcome had it been disclosed
earlier.  

C is correct. The untimely disclosure of evidence favorable to the defense (including impeachment information)
violates the Constitution if the evidence would have created a reasonable probability of a different outcome
had it been disclosed earlier.  

D is incorrect. The prosecutor's motive is not an element of a constitutional claim involving untimely disclosure
of evidence favorable to the defense (including impeachment information). Rather, such untimely disclosure
would violate the Constitution only if the evidence would have created a reasonable probability of a different
outcome had it been disclosed earlier.

Question 1549 - Criminal Law - Homicide

 The question was: 

A state statute divides murder into degrees and defines murder in the first degree as murder committed
willfully with premeditation and deliberation. The statute defines murder in the second degree as all other
murder at common law and defines voluntary manslaughter as at common law.  

A man hated one of his coworkers. Upon learning that the coworker was at a neighbor's house, the man
grabbed his gun and went to the neighbor's house hoping to provoke the coworker into attacking him so that
he could then shoot the coworker. After arriving at the house, the man insulted the coworker and bragged that
he had had sexual relations with the coworker's wife two weeks earlier. This statement was not true, but it
enraged the coworker, who grabbed a knife from the kitchen table and ran toward the man. The man then shot
and killed the coworker.  

What is the most serious homicide offense of which the man could properly be convicted? 

A: Murder in the first degree.
B: Murder in the second degree.
C: Voluntary manslaughter, because he provoked the coworker.
D: No form of criminal homicide, because he acted in self-defense.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is correct. The killing was committed willfully with premeditation and deliberation. The killing cannot be
justified as having been in self-defense, because the man was the clear aggressor who intentionally provoked
the coworker so that he could shoot and kill him.  

B is incorrect. Murder in the second degree is not the most serious homicide offense of which the man could
properly be convicted. The man is guilty of first-degree murder, because he committed the killing willfully with
premeditation and deliberation. The killing cannot be justified as having been in self-defense, because the man
intentionally provoked the coworker so that he could shoot and kill him.  

C is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter is not the most serious homicide offense of which the man could
properly be convicted, because he was not acting in the heat of passion when he killed the coworker. The man
is guilty of first-degree murder, because he committed the killing willfully with premeditation and deliberation,
and the killing cannot be justified as having been in self-defense.  

D is incorrect. The killing cannot be justified as having been in self-defense, because the man intentionally
provoked the coworker so that he could shoot and kill him. The man is guilty of first-degree murder, because
he committed the killing willfully with premeditation and deliberation.

Question 1549 - Criminal Law - Homicide

 The question was: 

A state statute divides murder into degrees and defines murder in the first degree as murder committed
willfully with premeditation and deliberation. The statute defines murder in the second degree as all other
murder at common law and defines voluntary manslaughter as at common law.  

A man hated one of his coworkers. Upon learning that the coworker was at a neighbor's house, the man
grabbed his gun and went to the neighbor's house hoping to provoke the coworker into attacking him so that
he could then shoot the coworker. After arriving at the house, the man insulted the coworker and bragged that
he had had sexual relations with the coworker's wife two weeks earlier. This statement was not true, but it
enraged the coworker, who grabbed a knife from the kitchen table and ran toward the man. The man then shot
and killed the coworker.  

What is the most serious homicide offense of which the man could properly be convicted? 

A: Murder in the first degree.
B: Murder in the second degree.
C: Voluntary manslaughter, because he provoked the coworker.
D: No form of criminal homicide, because he acted in self-defense.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is correct. The killing was committed willfully with premeditation and deliberation. The killing cannot be
justified as having been in self-defense, because the man was the clear aggressor who intentionally provoked
the coworker so that he could shoot and kill him.  

B is incorrect. Murder in the second degree is not the most serious homicide offense of which the man could
properly be convicted. The man is guilty of first-degree murder, because he committed the killing willfully with
premeditation and deliberation. The killing cannot be justified as having been in self-defense, because the man
intentionally provoked the coworker so that he could shoot and kill him.  

C is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter is not the most serious homicide offense of which the man could
properly be convicted, because he was not acting in the heat of passion when he killed the coworker. The man
is guilty of first-degree murder, because he committed the killing willfully with premeditation and deliberation,
and the killing cannot be justified as having been in self-defense.  

D is incorrect. The killing cannot be justified as having been in self-defense, because the man intentionally
provoked the coworker so that he could shoot and kill him. The man is guilty of first-degree murder, because
he committed the killing willfully with premeditation and deliberation.

Question 1556 - Criminal Law - Homicide

 The question was: 

A wife decided to kill her husband because she was tired of his infidelity. She managed to obtain some
cyanide, a deadly poison. One evening, she poured wine laced with the cyanide into a glass, handed it to her
husband, and proposed a loving toast. The husband was so pleased with the toast that he set the glass of
wine down on a table, grabbed his wife, and kissed her passionately. After the kiss, the wife changed her mind
about killing the husband. She hid the glass of wine behind a lamp on the table, planning to leave it for the
maid to clean up. The husband did not drink the wine.  

The maid found the glass of wine while cleaning the next day. Rather than throw the wine away, the maid
drank it. Shortly thereafter, she fell into a coma and died from cyanide poisoning.  

In a common law jurisdiction, of what crime(s), if any, could the wife be found guilty? 

A: Attempted murder of the husband and murder or manslaughter of the maid.
B: Only attempted murder of the husband.
C: Only murder or manslaughter of the maid.
D: No crime.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is correct. As to the husband, the wife intended to murder him and took a substantial step to carry out that
murder; the husband would have been killed had he drunk the wine. As to the maid, a trier of fact could view
the wife's conduct as depraved-heart recklessness (which would make her guilty of murder) or at the very least
as criminal negligence (which would make her guilty of manslaughter).  

B is incorrect. The woman could be found guilty of attempted murder of the husband, because she intended to
murder him and took a substantial step to carry out that murder; the husband would have been killed had he
drunk the wine. However, the wife could also be found guilty of murder or manslaughter of the maid. As to the
maid, a trier of fact could view the wife's conduct as depraved-heart recklessness (which would make her guilty

Question 1562 - Criminal Law - Other Crimes

 The question was: 

In a crowded football stadium, a man saw a wallet fall out of a spectator's purse. The man picked up the wallet
and found that it contained $100 in cash. Thinking that he could use the money and seeing no one watching,
the man put the wallet in the pocket of his coat. Just then, the spectator approached the man and asked if he
had seen a missing wallet. The man said no and went home with the wallet.  

Of what crime, if any, is the man guilty? 

A: Embezzlement.
B: False pretenses.
C: Larceny.
D: No crime.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The initial taking of the wallet was a trespass, because the man knew that the wallet belonged to
the spectator and he intended to convert the wallet to his own use in permanent deprivation of the spectator's
right. Accordingly, and because the spectator never entrusted the man with the wallet, the man is guilty of
larceny rather than embezzlement.  

B is incorrect. The initial taking of the wallet was a trespass, because the man knew that the wallet belonged to
the spectator and he intended to convert the wallet to his own use in permanent deprivation of the spectator's
right. Accordingly, and because the man never obtained title to the wallet, he is guilty of larceny rather than
false pretenses.  

C is correct. The initial taking of the wallet was a trespass, because the man knew that the wallet belonged to
the spectator and he intended to convert the wallet to his own use in permanent deprivation of the spectator's
right. Accordingly, the man is guilty of larceny.  

D is incorrect. The initial taking of the wallet was a trespass, because the man knew that the wallet belonged to
the spectator and he intended to convert the wallet to his own use in permanent deprivation of the spectator's
right. Accordingly, the man is guilty of larceny.

Question 1569 - Criminal Law - Other Crimes

 The question was: 

A woman went to an art gallery and falsely represented that she was an agent for a museum and wanted to
purchase a painting that was hanging in the gallery. The woman and the gallery owner then agreed on a price
for the painting to be paid 10 days later, and the woman took the painting. When the gallery failed to receive
the payment when due, the owner called the museum and discovered that the woman did not work there. The
owner then notified the police.  

When interviewed by the police, the woman admitted making the false representation and acquiring the
painting, but she said she believed that the painting had been stolen from her by someone who worked in the
gallery.  

Is the woman guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses? 

A: No, because she believed that the painting belonged to her.
B: No, because the gallery owner would have sold the painting to anyone who agreed to pay the price.
C: Yes, because even if her representation was not material, she never intended to pay for the painting.
D: Yes, because she knowingly made a false representation on which the gallery owner relied.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is correct. The crime of false pretenses, like other theft crimes, requires the intent to steal. The woman
cannot properly be found guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses, because she made the false
statements to obtain property that she subjectively believed belonged to her.  

B is incorrect. This fact does not excuse the woman for knowingly making false statements to obtain property
that she would not otherwise have been able to obtain. The reason the woman cannot properly be found guilty
of obtaining property by false pretenses is that she lacked the requisite intent to steal; she made the false
statements to obtain property that she subjectively believed belonged to her.  

C is incorrect. In some jurisdictions, a false pretenses conviction can be based on a promise to make payment
in the future if the promisor had no present intent to make the future payment. But the promisor must have the
intent to steal the property. The woman cannot properly be found guilty of obtaining property by false
pretenses, because she lacked the requisite intent to steal; she made the false statements to obtain property
that she subjectively believed belonged to her.  

D is incorrect. Even assuming that the woman otherwise could be convicted of false pretenses, false pretenses
requires the intent to steal required for other theft crimes. Accordingly, the woman cannot properly be found
guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses, because she made the false statements to obtain property that
she subjectively believed belonged to her.

purchase a painting that was hanging in the gallery. The woman and the gallery owner then agreed on a price
for the painting to be paid 10 days later, and the woman took the painting. When the gallery failed to receive
the payment when due, the owner called the museum and discovered that the woman did not work there. The
owner then notified the police.  

When interviewed by the police, the woman admitted making the false representation and acquiring the
painting, but she said she believed that the painting had been stolen from her by someone who worked in the
gallery.  

Is the woman guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses? 

A: No, because she believed that the painting belonged to her.
B: No, because the gallery owner would have sold the painting to anyone who agreed to pay the price.
C: Yes, because even if her representation was not material, she never intended to pay for the painting.
D: Yes, because she knowingly made a false representation on which the gallery owner relied.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is correct. The crime of false pretenses, like other theft crimes, requires the intent to steal. The woman
cannot properly be found guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses, because she made the false
statements to obtain property that she subjectively believed belonged to her.  

B is incorrect. This fact does not excuse the woman for knowingly making false statements to obtain property
that she would not otherwise have been able to obtain. The reason the woman cannot properly be found guilty
of obtaining property by false pretenses is that she lacked the requisite intent to steal; she made the false
statements to obtain property that she subjectively believed belonged to her.  

C is incorrect. In some jurisdictions, a false pretenses conviction can be based on a promise to make payment
in the future if the promisor had no present intent to make the future payment. But the promisor must have the
intent to steal the property. The woman cannot properly be found guilty of obtaining property by false
pretenses, because she lacked the requisite intent to steal; she made the false statements to obtain property
that she subjectively believed belonged to her.  

D is incorrect. Even assuming that the woman otherwise could be convicted of false pretenses, false pretenses
requires the intent to steal required for other theft crimes. Accordingly, the woman cannot properly be found
guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses, because she made the false statements to obtain property that
she subjectively believed belonged to her.

Question 1577 - Criminal Law - Other Crimes

 The question was: 

A woman broke off her engagement to a man but refused to return the engagement ring the man had given
her. One night, the man entered the woman's house after midnight to retrieve the ring. Although the woman
was not at home, a neighbor saw the man enter the house and called the police. The man unsuccessfully
searched for the ring for 10 minutes. As he was walking out the front door, the police arrived and immediately
arrested him.  

The man has been charged with burglary in a jurisdiction that follows the common law.  

Which of the following, if proved, would serve as the man's best defense to the charge?  

A: The man knew that the woman kept a key under the doormat and he used the key to enter the house.
B: The man incorrectly and unreasonably believed that he was legally entitled to the ring.
C: The man knew that no one was at home when he entered the house.
D: The man took nothing of value from the house.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. This fact does not provide a defense to burglary, because the man still broke into and entered
the house without the woman's consent. Instead, the man's subjective belief that he was entitled to the ring
(even if that belief was incorrect and unreasonable) negates the intent required for the underlying felony of
larceny.  

B is correct. The crime of burglary requires that the breaking and entering of the dwelling have been done with
the intent to commit an underlying felony (in most cases, larceny). The man's subjective belief that he was
entitled to the ring (even if that belief was incorrect and unreasonable) negates the intent required for the
underlying felony of larceny.  

C is incorrect. This fact does not provide a defense, because the crime of burglary does not require that the
dwelling be occupied at the time of the breaking and entering. Instead, the man's subjective belief that he was
entitled to the ring (even if that belief was incorrect and unreasonable) negates the intent required for the
underlying felony of larceny.  

D is incorrect. This fact does not provide a defense, because burglary requires that the person breaking and
entering intend to commit a felony, not that the person be successful in committing the felony. Instead, the
man's subjective belief that he was entitled to the ring (even if that belief was incorrect and unreasonable)
negates the intent required for the underlying felony of larceny.

Question 1584 - Criminal Law - Inchoate Crimes

 The question was: 

A woman wanted to kill a business competitor. She contacted a man who she believed was willing to commit
murder for hire and offered him $50,000 to kill the competitor. The man agreed to do so and accepted $25,000
as a down payment. Unbeknownst to the woman, the man was an undercover police officer.  

In a jurisdiction that has adopted the unilateral theory of conspiracy, is the woman guilty of conspiracy to
murder the business competitor?  

A: No, because the man did not intend to kill the competitor.
B: No, because it would have been impossible for the woman to kill the competitor by this method.
C: Yes, because the woman believed that she had an agreement with the man that would bring about the
competitor's death.
D: Yes, because the woman took a substantial step toward bringing about the competitor's death by paying the
man $25,000.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. In jurisdictions that recognize unilateral conspiracies, it is enough that one person agree with
another person to commit a crime (and in some jurisdictions, that an overt act in furtherance of that agreement
be committed). It is no defense to unilateral conspiracy that the other person was feigning agreement or acting
in an undercover capacity. Therefore, the man's lack of intent does not make the woman any less guilty.  

B is incorrect. In jurisdictions that recognize unilateral conspiracies, it is enough that one person agree with
another person to commit a crime (and in some jurisdictions, that an overt act in furtherance of that agreement
be committed). It is no defense to unilateral conspiracy that the other person was feigning agreement or acting
in an undercover capacity. Therefore, the woman cannot prevail on any impossibility defense.  

C is correct. In jurisdictions that recognize unilateral conspiracies, it is enough that one person agree with
another person to commit a crime (and in some jurisdictions, that an overt act in furtherance of that agreement
be committed). It is no defense to unilateral conspiracy that the other person was feigning agreement or acting
in an undercover capacity. Here, the woman agreed to commit a crime and she committed an overt act in
furtherance of that agreement when she paid the man $25,000. She therefore is guilty of conspiracy in a
jurisdiction that recognizes unilateral conspiracies.  

D is incorrect. The woman is guilty, but not because she took a substantial step, which is a concept relevant
under the Model Penal Code to attempt rather than conspiracy. The woman is guilty of conspiracy because in
jurisdictions that recognize unilateral conspiracies, it is enough that one person agree with another person to
commit a crime (and in some jurisdictions, that an overt act in furtherance of that agreement be committed). It
is no defense to unilateral conspiracy that the other person was feigning agreement or acting in an undercover
capacity.

D is incorrect. The woman is guilty, but not because she took a substantial step, which is a concept relevant
under the Model Penal Code to attempt rather than conspiracy. The woman is guilty of conspiracy because in
jurisdictions that recognize unilateral conspiracies, it is enough that one person agree with another person to
commit a crime (and in some jurisdictions, that an overt act in furtherance of that agreement be committed). It
is no defense to unilateral conspiracy that the other person was feigning agreement or acting in an undercover
capacity.

Question 1589 - Criminal Law - Inchoate Crimes

 The question was: 

A state statute provides as follows: "The maintenance of any ongoing enterprise in the nature of a betting
parlor or bookmaking organization is a felony."  

A prosecutor has evidence that a woman has been renting an office to a man, that the man has been using the
office as a betting parlor within the meaning of the statute, and that the woman is aware of this use.  

Which of the following additional pieces of evidence would be most useful to the prosecutor's effort to convict
the woman as an accomplice to the man's violation of the statute?  

A: The woman was previously convicted of running a betting parlor herself on the same premises.
B: The woman charges the man considerably more in rent than she charged the preceding tenant, who used
the office for legitimate activities.
C: The woman has personally placed bets with the man at the office location.
D: The man has paid the woman the rent in bills that are traceable as the proceeds of gambling activity.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The woman's prior conviction would not necessarily show that she has a personal stake in the
continuing success of the man's criminal venture (and thus an intent to aid in that venture).  

B is correct. Showing that the woman benefits from the gambling would indicate her personal stake in the
continuing success of the man's criminal venture (and thus her intent to aid in that venture).  

C is incorrect. Showing that the woman has placed bets would confirm that she knows that the premises are
being used for gambling. However, it would not necessarily show that she has a personal stake in the
continuing success of the man's criminal venture (and thus an intent to aid in that venture).  

D is incorrect. The source of the rent payments, assuming that the rent is not above the market price for the
premises, would not necessarily show that the woman has a personal stake in the continuing success of the
man's criminal venture (and thus an intent to aid in that venture).

Question 1594 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons

 The question was: 

After a defendant was indicted on federal bank fraud charges and released on bail, his attorney filed notice of
the defendant's intent to offer an insanity defense. The prosecutor then enlisted the help of a forensic
psychologist who was willing to participate in an "undercover" mental examination of the defendant. The
psychologist contacted the defendant and pretended to represent an executive personnel agency. She told the
defendant about an attractive employment opportunity and invited him to a "preliminary screening interview" to
determine his qualifications for the job. As part of the purported screening process, the psychologist gave the
defendant psychological tests that enabled her to form a reliable opinion about his mental state at the time of
the alleged offense.  

What is the strongest basis for a defense objection to the psychologist's testimony regarding the defendant's
mental state? 

A: The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.
B: The Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.
C: The Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.
D: The federal common law privilege for confidential communications between psychotherapist and patient.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The Fourth Amendment does not prevent the government from using deception to obtain
incriminating admissions.  

B is incorrect. The Fifth Amendment privilege protects against compelled self-incrimination, not against the use
of deception to obtain a suspect's voluntary admissions.  

C is correct. After a defendant is indicted, the right to counsel attaches, and authorities may not use deception
to deliberately elicit statements related to the crime from the defendant without the representation of counsel.  

D is incorrect. While there is such a federal common law privilege for communications intended to be kept
confidential for the purpose of obtaining psychiatric services, the facts in this case do not support the privilege.

Question 1598 - Criminal Law - General Principles

 The question was: 

A defendant is charged with an offense under a statute that provides as follows: "Any person who, while
intoxicated, appears in any public place and manifests a drunken condition by obstreperous or indecent
conduct is guilty of a misdemeanor."  

At trial, the evidence shows that the defendant was intoxicated when police officers burst into his house and
arrested him pursuant to a valid warrant. It was a cold night, and the officers hustled the defendant out of his
house without giving him time to get his coat. The defendant became angry and obstreperous when the
officers refused to let him go back into the house to retrieve his coat. The officers left him handcuffed outside
in the street, waiting for a special squad car to arrive. The arrest warrant was later vacated.  

Can the defendant properly be convicted of violating the statute? 

A: No, because the defendant's claim of mistreatment is valid.
B: No, because the statute requires proof of a voluntary appearance in a public place.
C: Yes, because the defendant voluntarily became intoxicated.
D: Yes, because the defendant voluntarily behaved in an obstreperous manner.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The defendant cannot properly be convicted, regardless of whether his claim is valid, because of
the general legal rule that a person is not guilty of a crime unless the act constituting the crime was committed
voluntarily. This rule precludes the defendant's conviction, because he did not voluntarily appear in a public
place.  

B is correct. The general legal rule is that a person is not guilty of a crime unless the act constituting the crime
was committed voluntarily. This rule precludes the defendant's conviction, because he did not voluntarily
appear in a public place.  

C is incorrect. The general legal rule is that a person is not guilty of a crime unless the act constituting the
crime was committed voluntarily. This rule precludes the defendant's conviction because, while the defendant
voluntarily became intoxicated, he did not voluntarily appear in a public place.  

D is incorrect. The general legal rule is that a person is not guilty of a crime unless the act constituting the

voluntarily behaved obstreperously, he did not voluntarily appear in a public place.

area where the maximum posted speed limit was 65 mph. The officer's usual practice was not to stop a car
unless it was going at least 5 mph over the posted limit, but contrary to her usual practice, she decided to stop
the man's car in the hope that she might discover evidence of drug dealing. After she stopped the car and
announced that she would be writing a speeding ticket, the officer ordered the man and his passenger to step
out of the car. When the passenger stepped out, the officer saw that the passenger had been sitting on a clear
bag of what the officer immediately recognized as marijuana. The officer arrested both the man and the
passenger for possession of marijuana.  

At their joint trial, the man and the passenger claim that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated because
the officer improperly (1) stopped the car for speeding as a pretext for investigating a hunch rather than for the
stated purpose of issuing a traffic ticket and (2) ordered the passenger to step out of the car even though there
was no reason to believe that the passenger was a criminal or dangerous.  

Are the man and the passenger correct? 

A: No, as to both the stop of the car and the officer's order that the passenger step out of the car.
B: No as to the stop of the car, but yes as to the officer's order that the passenger step out of the car.
C: Yes as to the stop of the car, but no as to the officer's order that the passenger step out of the car.
D: Yes, as to both the stop of the car and the officer's order that the passenger step out of the car.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is correct. The stop of the car was constitutional, because it was objectively justifiable (regardless of the
officer's subjective motivation), and both the driver and any passengers may be ordered to step out of a car
during a lawful traffic stop.  

B is incorrect. It is correct that the stop of the car was constitutional, because it was objectively justifiable
(regardless of the officer's subjective motivation). However, it is also correct that both the driver and any
passengers may be ordered to step out of a car during a lawful traffic stop.  

C is incorrect. It is correct that both the driver and any passengers may be ordered to step out of a car during a
lawful traffic stop. However, it is also correct that the stop of the car here was constitutional, because it was
objectively justifiable (regardless of the officer's subjective motivation).  

D is incorrect. The stop of the car was constitutional, because it was objectively justifiable (regardless of the
officer's subjective motivation), and both the driver and any passengers may be ordered to step out of the car
during a lawful traffic stop.

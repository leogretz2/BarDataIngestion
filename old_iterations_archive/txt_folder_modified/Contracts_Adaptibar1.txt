Question 5 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A contractor painted an owner's house under a contract which called for payment of $2,000. The owner,
contending in good faith that the porch had not been painted properly, refused to pay anything. 

On June 15, the contractor mailed a letter to the owner stating, "I am in serious need of money. Please send
the $2,000 to me before July 1." On June 18, the owner replied, "I will settle for $1,800 provided you agree to
repaint the porch." The contractor did not reply to this letter. 

Thereafter the owner mailed a check for $1,800 marked "Payment in full on the painting contract as per letter
dated June 18." The contractor received the check on June 30. Because he was badly in need of money, the
contractor cashed the check without objection and spent the proceeds but has refused to repaint the porch. 

The owner's refusal to pay anything to the contractor when he finished painting was a 

A: partial breach of contract only if the contractor had properly or substantially painted the porch.
B: partial breach of contract whether or not the contractor had properly or substantially painted the porch.
C: total breach of contract only if the contractor had properly or substantially painted the porch.
D: total breach of contract whether or not the contractor had properly or substantially painted the porch.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a contractor's material breach of contract
may justify the owner from withholding performance. However, if the contractor has substantially performed on
the contract, the owner is still obligated to perform. Therefore, the owner's refusal to pay any of the amount
due under the contract would be a total breach. A and B are incorrect because the owner's refusal to pay
would not be a partial breach. D is incorrect because if the contractor had not substantially performed, the
owner would be justified in withholding performance.

Question 6 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A contractor had painted an owner's house, according to specifications, under a contract which called for
payment of $2,000. The owner, contending in good faith that the porch had not been painted properly, refused
to pay anything. 

On June 15, the contractor mailed a letter to the owner stating, "I am in serious need of money. Please send
the $2,000 to me before July 1." On June 18, the owner replied, "I will settle for $1,800 provided you agree to
repaint the porch." The contractor did not reply to this letter. 

Thereafter the owner mailed a check for $1,800 marked "Payment in full on the painting contract as per letter
dated June 18." The contractor received the check on June 30. Because he was badly in need of money, the
contractor cashed the check without objection and spent the proceeds but has refused to repaint the porch. 

After cashing the check the contractor sued the owner for $200.00. The contractor probably will 

A: succeed, because he can prove that he had painted the porch according to specifications.
B: succeed, because he cashed the check under economic duress.
C: not succeed, because he cashed the check without objection.
D: not succeed, because he is entitled to recover only the reasonable value of his services.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. A promise to settle a claim may be consideration to support a return promise so long as
there is a good faith dispute over the validity of the claim. The owner's June 18th letter, together with his check
for $1,800 with the notation "payment in full" is an offer of accord and satisfaction. The contractor accepted this
offer when he retained and cashed the check without objection. In doing so, he waived his right to the
remaining $200 from the original contract. 

A is incorrect because even if the contractor can establish that he painted the porch according to contract
specifications, the owner's good faith belief that the contractor had not painted the porch properly is sufficient
consideration for his offer of settlement. B is incorrect because although the contractor is in need of money, he
has a reasonable alternative - he can refuse to make an accord and instead file a lawsuit for payment pursuant
to the terms of the original agreement. D is incorrect because expectation damages, not reliance damages, are
the standard measure of recovery in breach of contract claims.

Question 7 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A contractor had painted an owner's house under a contract which called for payment of $2,000. The owner,
contending in good faith that the porch had not been painted properly, refused to pay anything. 

On June 15, the contractor mailed a letter to the owner stating, "I am in serious need of money. Please send
the $2,000 to me before July 1." On June 18, the owner replied, "I will settle for $1,800 provided you agree to
repaint the porch." The contractor did not reply to this letter. 

Thereafter the owner mailed a check for $1,800 marked "Payment in full on the painting contract as per letter
dated June 18." The contractor received the check on June 30. Because he was badly in need of money, the
contractor cashed the check without objection and spent the proceeds but has refused to repaint the porch. 

In an action by the owner against the contractor for any provable damages the owner sustained because the
porch was not repainted, he probably will 

A: succeed, because by cashing the check the contractor impliedly promised to repaint the porch.
B: succeed, because the contractor accepted the owner's offer by not replying to the letter of June 18.
C: not succeed, because the owner's letter of June 18 was a counter-offer which the contractor never
accepted.
D: not succeed, because there is no consideration to support the contractor's promise, if any.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. A promise to settle a claim may be consideration to support a return promise so long as
there is a good faith dispute over the validity of the claim. The owner's June 18 letter, read in conjunction with
the $1,800 check marked "payment in full," is an offer of accord and satisfaction which was accepted when the
contractor cashed the check. The contractor's implicit promise to repaint the porch was supported by
consideration - the owner's promise to settle the claim for $1,800. When the contractor cashed the check
marked "Payment in full as per letter dated June 18," he implicitly accepted the accord (the offer to settle for
$1,800 in exchange for the promise to repaint). 

D is incorrect because the owner's promise to settle was sufficient consideration to support the contractor's
promise. C is incorrect because the contractor cashing the check manifested assent to the settlement terms. B
is incorrect because normally mere inaction will not be construed as an acceptance.

Question 24 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

An agent engaged an inexperienced actress to do a small role in a new Broadway play for a period of six
months at a salary of $200 a week. The actress turned down another role in order to accept this engagement.
On the third day of the run, the actress was hospitalized with influenza and a replacement was hired to do the
part. A week later, the actress recovered, but the agent refused to accept her services for the remainder of the
contract period. The actress then brought an action against the agent for breach of contract. 

Which of the following is the actress's best legal theory? 

A: Her acting contract with the agent was legally severable into weekly units.
B: Her performance of the literal terms of the contract was physically impossible.
C: Her reliance on the engagement with the agent by declining another acting role created an estoppel against
the agent.
D: Her failure to perform for one week was not a material failure so as to discharge the agent's duty to perform.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's material breach of an obligation, if
uncured, may discharge the other party's obligation under the contract. Therefore, the agent's obligation may
only be discharged if the actress's inability to perform for one week is found to be a material breach. Whether
the breach will be found to be material will depend on a number of factors, including the prospect that the
actress may cure the breach, whether damages are available to compensate the agent for the harm suffered
and the degree to which the actress's failure to perform substantially deprived the agent of his expected benefit
under the contract. If the actress is found not to have materially breached, then the agent's failure to accept
her services for the remainder of the engagement would in turn be found to be a material breach. 

D offers the best legal theory because none of the other answers offers the actress a basis for arguing breach.
A is incorrect because, even if the contract were severable, it is not relevant to whether the agent's remaining
obligation to engage the actress may be discharged. B is incorrect because, although impossibility of
performance could provide a basis for excuse for the actress, it would not support the actress's argument that
the agent breached the contract. C is incorrect because the issue presented is not whether the agent owed a
duty to the actress on the basis of reliance or otherwise (he clearly did, based on the agreement between
them), but rather whether the agent breached that duty.

Question 25 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

An agent engaged an inexperienced actress to do a small role in a new Broadway play for a period of six
months at a salary of $200 a week. The actress turned down another role in order to accept this engagement.
On the third day of the run, the actress was hospitalized with influenza and a replacement was hired to do the
part. A week later, the actress recovered, but the agent refused to accept her services for the remainder of the
contract period. The actress then brought an action against the agent for breach of contract. 

Which of the following, if true, would adversely affect the actress' rights in her action against the agent? 

A: The agent could only find one replacement, who demanded a contract for a minimum of six months if she
was to perform at all.
B: The replacement, by general acclaim, was much better in the role than the original actress had been.
C: The agent had offered the original actress a position as the replacement's understudy at a salary of $100 a
week, which the original actress declined.
D: The agent had offered the actress a secretarial position at a salary of $300 a week, which the actress
declined.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's material breach of an obligation, if
uncured, may have the effect of discharging the other party's obligation under the contract. Therefore, the
agent's obligation may only be discharged if the actress's inability to perform for one week is found to be a
material breach. Whether the breach will be found to be material will depend on a number of factors, including
the prospect that the actress will cure the breach, whether damages are available to compensate the agent for
the harm suffered and the degree to which the actress's failure to perform substantially deprived the agent of
his expected benefit under the contract. The fact that the agent could only find a replacement who demanded
a six-month contract speaks to the extent of the loss to the agent due to the actress's absence, and suggests
that he was justified in withholding his own performance. 

B is incorrect because the fact that the replacement may have been a better actress suggests that any breach
by the original actress was partial, because the agent was easily made whole during the actress's absence. C
and D are incorrect because the agent's offer of substitute employment is not relevant to whether the agent
was justified in withholding the position that he promised to give the actress - he would only be so justified if
the actress materially breached the contract.

Question 35 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation

 The question was: 

On March 1, a seller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to a buyer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31.
The buyer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to a creditor of the seller in satisfaction of a debt
which the seller said he had promised to pay the creditor. 

On March 10, the buyer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the
$25,000 to the creditor. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed in $45,000 rather than
$46,000 as the purchase price. Neither the buyer nor the seller carefully read the writing before signing it on
March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the
payment to the creditor. 

Which of the following would be most important in deciding an action by the creditor against the buyer for
$25,000? 

A: Whether the buyer-seller agreement was completely integrated.
B: Whether the buyer was negligent in not having carefully read the written agreement.
C: Whether the seller was negligent in not having carefully read the written agreement.
D: Whether the creditor was a party to the contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement where the prior
agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a
completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive
manifestation of the parties' understanding). The buyer and the seller entered into a final written agreement
that was silent with respect to the verbal promise that the creditor seeks to enforce (the buyer's promise to
repay the seller's debt). Because the writing was silent with respect to this, the creditor seeks to supplement,
rather than contradict, the writing with extrinsic evidence of the promise. Therefore, whether the promise will
be admissible hinges on whether the writing was a complete integration. 

B and C are incorrect because the parol evidence rule may apply to exclude evidence of the promise
regardless of whether the parties were negligent in reading the final writing. D is incorrect because even if the
creditor was not a party to the contract, the creditor may be able to recover as an intended third-party
beneficiary.

Question 36 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

On March 1, a seller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to a buyer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31.
The buyer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to a creditor of the seller in satisfaction of a debt
which the seller said he had promised to pay the creditor. 

On March 10, the buyer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the
$25,000 to the creditor. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed $45,000 rather than $46,000
as the purchase price. Neither the buyer nor the seller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15.
Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to the
creditor. 

In an action by the creditor against the buyer for $25,000, which of the following, if proved, would best serve
the buyer as a defense? 

A: There was no consideration to support the seller's antecedent promise to pay the creditor the $25,000.
B: On March 5, before the creditor was aware of the oral agreement between the seller and the buyer, the
seller agreed with the buyer not to pay any part of the purchase price to the creditor.
C: Whatever action the creditor may have had against the buyer was barred by the statute of limitations prior
to March 1.
D: Before he instituted his action against the buyer, the creditor had not notified either the buyer or seller that
he had accepted the buyer-seller arrangement for paying the creditor.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended
beneficiary of the promise. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to
an intended beneficiary until the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if he manifests
assent to or materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise before receiving notice of the
discharge. Since the promise at issue is the buyer's promise to pay $25,000 "to the creditor," the creditor is an
intended beneficiary because the performance flows directly to him. However, if the buyer and seller later
agree not to pay any of the purchase price to the creditor before the creditor was aware of the contract, that
agreement would be effective in discharging the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary because those
rights would not have vested. 

A is incorrect because what matters is whether the buyer's promise is supported by consideration (which it
was); it is irrelevant whether the seller's promise to the creditor was so supported. C is incorrect because the
creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary is based on an agreement that was only effective on March 1. The
statute of limitations does not run on a third-party claim simply because the contract is completed. D is
incorrect because bringing suit to enforce the promise causes the rights to vest; no other notification is
necessary.

Question 37 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation

 The question was: 

On March 1, a seller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to the buyer for $46,000 to be paid on March
31. The buyer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to a creditor of the seller in satisfaction of a
debt which the seller said he had promised to pay the creditor. 

On March 10, the buyer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the
$25,000 to the creditor. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed $45,000 rather than $46,000
as the purchase price. Neither the buyer nor the seller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15.
Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to the
creditor. 

If the buyer refused to pay more than $45,000 for Homestead, in an action by the seller against the buyer for
an additional $1,000, it would be to the seller's advantage to try to prove that 

A: the writing was intended only as a sham.
B: the writing was only a partial integration.
C: there was a mistake in integration.
D: there was a misunderstanding between the seller and the buyer concerning the purchase price.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of evidence of an agreement made prior to
the adoption of a final writing if the prior agreement relates to matters within the scope of that writing. However,
where a clerical error has been made in reducing an agreement to writing, a party may bring an action in
equitable reformation to have the writing reformed to correct the error or to include an omitted provision. The
parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence to show the mistake that provides the basis for
reformation. Therefore, if the buyer and the seller verbally agreed that the buyer would pay $46,000 in
exchange for Homestead but the writing stated $45,000 due to an error in transcription, the seller may seek to
have the writing reformed on grounds of mistake. 

A is incorrect because the extrinsic evidence does not support the suggestion that the writing is a sham. B is
incorrect because evidence that the actual agreed price for Homestead was $46,000 contradicts the writing,
and therefore extrinsic evidence would likely be excluded regardless of whether the agreement was only
partially integrated. D is incorrect because a proving a misunderstanding about the purchase price would not
provide a defense to enforcing the agreement as written.

Question 60 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile
driven by a woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was
liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any
losses you incur as a result of the accident." The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the
woman and that he would pay the bill. 

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating
that his son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate. The
father replied: "If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you." 

In an action by the woman against the father for wages lost while she was incapacitated as a result of the
accident, which of the following would be the father's best defense? 

A: Lack of consideration
B: Mistake of fact as to basic assumption
C: Statute of Frauds
D: Indefiniteness of the father's promise

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Generally, valuable consideration on both sides of the bargain is required for an
enforceable contract. Here, the woman has given no consideration for the father's promise that the woman will
be reimbursed. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the woman detrimentally relied on the promise so the
man will not be estopped from not performing. Since there was no consideration, and promissory estoppel is
not applicable, the father's promise will not be enforceable due to lack of consideration. 

B is incorrect because if the father's mistake of fact was unilateral, then the mistake will not prevent the
formation of a contract. If the mistake of fact was mutual, the contract will still be enforceable as the father bore
the risk that his assumption about his liability was incorrect. C is incorrect because the father's promise does
not fall under the Statute of Frauds; it is not a suretyship agreement because the father believed he was
vicariously liable. D is incorrect because a promise is sufficiently definite if it provides a basis for determining
breach and for giving a remedy. Thus, the father's promise to pay for "any losses…as a result of the accident"
is sufficiently definite.

Question 61 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile
driven by a woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was
liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any
losses you incur as a result of the accident." The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the
woman and that he would pay the bill. 

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. 

Which of the following provides most significant information in determining whether or not there was
bargained-for consideration to support the father's promise to the physician? 

A: The physician had not begun treating the woman before the father called him.
B: The father had a contract with the woman.
C: The father had a contract with the woman and the physician had not begun treating the woman before the
father called him.
D: None of the above answers provide information relevant to whether there was bargained-for consideration
for the father's promise to the physician.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. If an action was already performed before the promise was made, it will not qualify as
consideration because it was not "bargained-for." Therefore, if the father's promise to pay the physician was
made after the physician began treating the woman, then the physician's treatment of the woman will not
constitute consideration. 

When a preexisting duty was owed to a third party, courts may hold that a new promise to do the same action
is not sufficient as consideration. If the father had a contract with the woman to pay for all losses, then he had
a preexisting duty to pay the doctor. Therefore, the father's subsequent promise to the doctor to pay the bill
may not constitute consideration as he was already obligated to pay under his contract with the woman. Thus,
the father's promise to pay was not bargained-for in exchange for the physician's promise to treat the woman.
Since both the timing of the father's call and the existence of a contract between the woman and the father are
significant in determining whether there was bargained-for consideration to support the father's promise to pay
the physician, C is correct while A, B, and D are incorrect.

Question 62 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile
driven by a woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was
liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any
losses you incur as a result of the accident." The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the
woman and that he would pay the bill. 

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating
that the son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate. The
father: "If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you." 

If the physician discontinued treating the woman before she had fully recovered and the woman brought an
action against the physician for breach of contract, which of the following arguments, if any, by the physician
would probably be effective in defense? 

A: The woman furnished no consideration, either express or implied.
B: The physician's contract was with the father and not with the woman.
C: Whatever contract the physician may have had with the woman was discharged by novation on account of
the agreement with the father.
D: None of the above

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Answer A is not an effective defense because there was bargained-for consideration
provided by another party. It is immaterial that the consideration was provided by the father instead of the
beneficiary (the woman). Thus, answer A is incorrect.  

Answer B is not an effective defense because although the woman was not a party to the contract between the
father and the physician, she is an intended third-party beneficiary. The woman can enforce the contract
because her rights as an intended third-party beneficiary vested when she went to the physician for treatment.
Thus, answer B is incorrect. 

Answer C is not an effective defense because a novation is an express agreement by all parties to substitute a
new party for an original party to the contract. Here, the woman is not being substituted for the father, she is
merely an intended third-party beneficiary. Thus, answer C is incorrect. Because answers A, B, and C are
incorrect, answer D is correct.

Question 63 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile
driven by the woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father erroneously believing that he was
liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating
that the son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate. The
father replied: "If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you." 

If the creditor did not file action against the son's estate, would the creditor succeed in an action against the
father for $200? 

A: Yes, because the creditor had detrimentally relied on the father's promise.
B: Yes, because the father's promise was supported by a bargained-for exchange.
C: No, because the creditor's claim against the son's estate was worthless.
D: No, because the father at most had only a moral obligation to pay the son's debts.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The father sought the creditor's forbearance in exchange for the father's promise to pay
the creditor. It makes no difference that the creditor's consideration benefited a third party instead of the
father. 

A is not the best answer because promissory estoppel based on detrimental reliance is only relevant when
there is not an enforceable contract. Since there is an enforceable contract between the father and the
creditor, detrimental reliance will not be the basis for the success of the creditor's action. C is incorrect
because if the creditor believed in good faith that his claim against the son's estate was valid, then the
forbearance of his legal right to sue is adequate consideration. D is incorrect because the father's payment is
not based on his moral obligation. Instead, the father's promise to the pay the creditor was made in exchange
for the creditor's promise not to exercise his legal right to bring suit against the son's estate.

Question 64 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile
driven by the woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was
liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any
losses you incur as a result of the accident." The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating
that the son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate. The
father replied: "If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you." 

The father honestly believed that he did not owe the creditor anything and at first refused to pay anything to
the creditor. If the creditor, honestly believing that the father owed him $200, then accepts $150 from the father
in settlement of the claim, will the creditor succeed in an action against the father for the remaining $50? 

A: Yes, because the son's debt of $200 was liquidated and undisputed.
B: Yes, because the creditor honestly believed that he had a legal right against the father for the full $200.
C: No, because the father honestly believed that the creditor did not have a legal right against him for the
$200.
D: No, because the father was not contractually obligated to pay the creditor $200 in the first place.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. The creditor will not succeed against the father because the original contract has been
discharged through accord and satisfaction. Partial payment of an original debt will satisfy as an accord and
satisfaction if there is a bona fide dispute about the validity of the claim. Here, the father honestly did not
believe that he owed the creditor. Therefore, the creditor's acceptance of $150 from the father "in settlement of
the claim" is a valid accord and satisfaction, resulting in the discharge of the original contract. Thus, the
creditor is not entitled to the remaining $50. 

A is incorrect because the fact that the son's debt to the creditor was undisputed does not prevent the father's
use of accord and satisfaction if the father believes in good faith that he does not owe the creditor. B is
incorrect because the creditor's honest belief will not prevent the discharge of the original debt by accord and
satisfaction if the creditor accepts the payment without reservation. D is incorrect because if the creditor
believed in good faith that his claim against the son's estate was valid, then the creditor's forbearance of his
legal right to sue was adequate consideration for the father's promise to pay $200.

Question 72 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation

 The question was: 

On March 1, a computer programming company orally agreed with a department store to write a set of
programs for the department store's computer and to coordinate the programs with the department store's
billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety: 

The department store will pay the computer programming company $20,000 in two equal installments within
one month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the
processing time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store's Zenon 747 computer; the
computer programming company to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed
writing. On June 6, the computer programming company demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half
done. After the department store denied liability, the parties orally agreed that the department store should
deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of the department store's computer systems
manager. 

On July 5, the computer programming company completed the programs. Tests showed that the computer
programs cut processing time by only 47 percent. The department store's computer systems manager refused
in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. The department store requested the escrow agent to return the
$20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the
department store continued to use the programs. 

If the computer programming company in fact had half-completed the job on June 6, would it then have been
entitled to $10,000? 

A: Yes, because June 6 was within one month of completion
B: Yes, because the computer programming company had done one-half the job.
C: No, because of a constructive condition precedent requiring at least substantial completion of the work
before the department store would have a duty to pay.
D: No, because "within one month of completion" would, in these circumstances, be interpreted to mean
"within one month after completion."

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The rules of contract construction dictate that the courts will construe words according to
their ordinary meaning unless it is clear that they were meant to be used in a technical sense. While "within
one month of completion" could be technically interpreted to refer to the month before the completion, there is
no indication that these words were meant to be used in the technical sense. Therefore, the phrase will be
given its ordinary meaning, that the payment will be received within one month after completion of the project.  

Answers A and B are incorrect because both improperly rely on a technical reading of the contract language.
Answer C is incorrect. Courts will read a constructive condition precedent regarding timing into the contract
when one performance will take a period of time to complete while the other can be completed in an instant. In
such a case, the court will make the completion of the longer performance a constructive condition precedent
to the execution of the shorter performance. However, in this contract the timing of the department store's
payment is subject to an express condition, and since that condition does not violate the interest of fairness,
the court will not read a constructive condition regarding timing into the contract.

Question 79 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

An assistant professor was hired by a college to teach mathematics and he is now in his third consecutive
one-year contract. Under state law he cannot acquire tenure until after five consecutive annual contracts. In his
third year, the assistant professor was notified that he was not being rehired for the following year. Applicable
state law and college rules did not require either a statement of reasons or a hearing, and in fact neither was
offered to the assistant professor. 

Which of the following, if established, sets forth the strongest argument the assistant professor could make to
compel the college to furnish him a statement of reasons for the failure to rehire him and an opportunity for a
hearing? 

A: There is no evidence that tenured teachers are any more qualified than he is.
B: He leased a home in reliance on an oral promise of reemployment by the college president.
C: He was the only teacher at the college whose contract was not renewed that year.
D: In the expectation of remaining at the college, he had just moved his elderly parents to the town in which
college is located.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. If the assistant professor leased a home in response to an oral promise of reemployment
by the college president, this establishes detrimental reliance on the part of the assistant professor and would
provide a substitute for consideration. Since the president should have expected to induce action with his
promise, a statement of reasons and a hearing may be necessary to determine a just remedy. See First
Restatement of Contracts section 90. 

A is incorrect because the experience of a tenured professor is irrelevant. C is incorrect because he had no
contractual rights to renewal and no contractual rights to a hearing or statement of reasons. D is incorrect
because the assistant professor's subjective expectation of renewal would not be sufficient to compel the
college to furnish him a statement of reasons or a hearing.

Question 83 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

An elderly widower lived alone on a small farm which he owned. Except for the farm, including the house and
its furnishings, the widower owned substantially no property. Under proper management, the farm was capable
of producing an adequate family income, but the widower was unable to do farm work or even to provide for
his own personal needs. The widower entered into an oral contract with his nephew by which the widower
agreed to convey the farm to his nephew if the nephew moved into the house with the widower, operated the
farm, and took care of the widower for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was
to be conveyed. The nephew, who lived about fifty miles away where he was operating a small business of his
own, terminated his business and moved in with the widower. With the assistance of his wife, the nephew gave
the widower excellent care until the widower died intestate about five years after the date of the contract. 

In his final years the widower was confined to his bed and required much personal service of an intimate and
arduous sort. The widower was survived by his only son who was also the widower's sole heir. The son
resided in a distant city and gave his father no attention in his father's final years. The son showed up for the
widower's funeral and demanded that the nephew vacate the farm immediately. Upon the nephew's refusal to
do so, the son brought an appropriate action for possession. The nephew answered by way of a counterclaim
to establish the nephew's right to possession and title to the farm. 

If the court's decision is in favor of the nephew, it will be because 

A: the land is located in a state where the Statute of Frauds will not be applied if there has been such part
performance as will result in an irreparable hardship if the contract is not performed.
B: the land is located in a state where the Statute of Frauds will not be applied if there has been such part
performance that is by its very nature unequivocally referable to the contract.
C: the son is precluded by the "clean hands" doctrine from enforcing his claim against the nephew.
D: the blood relationship of uncle-nephew is sufficient to remove the necessity for any writing to satisfy the
Statute of Frauds.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Part performance standing alone does not make a contract that is within the Statute of
Frauds enforceable. Those jurisdictions adopting the approach in Restatement section 129 allow specific
enforcement of a promise to convey land if the party seeking enforcement "in reasonable reliance on the
contract and on the continuing assent of the party against whom enforcement is sought, has so changed his
position that injustice can only be avoided by specific enforcement." The nephew's reliance and hardship are
demonstrated by the following facts: The nephew terminated his business and moved fifty miles to care for the
widower and fully performed by continuing to care for the widower for five years, the final years of which
required "intimate and arduous care." 

B is incorrect because although the nephew moved onto the property with the widower, the nephew did not
take sole possession and make improvements or other such acts as would unequivocally refer to the contract
for the transfer of title to the land. C is incorrect because the son did not engage in inequitable conduct in a
transaction with the nephew. The "clean hands doctrine" applies only if inequitable conduct relates to the
transaction for which he seeks relief - the oral agreement between the nephew and the widower. D is incorrect
because a blood relationship does not remove a transaction from the Statute of Frauds and, in fact, may
require stronger evidence that the transaction was a contract.

Question 98 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

During 2006 a series of arsons, one of which damaged a huge store, occurred in a city. In early 2007 the city's
City Council adopted this resolution: 

The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed
here. The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently,
the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 "for each day's
work you actually perform in investigating our fire." Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution
repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio
stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of
the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store's
president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the
detective also claim the city's reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective
immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective's investigation, the store's
employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay
the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its
reward. 

In which of the following ways could the city reward offer be effectively accepted? 

A: Only by an offeree's return promise to make a reasonable effort to bring about the arrest and conviction of
an arsonist within the scope of the offer.
B: Only by an offeree's making the arrest and assisting in the successful conviction of an arsonist within the
scope of the offer.
C: By an offeree's supplying information leading to arrest and conviction of an arsonist within the scope of the
offer.
D: By an offeree's communication of assent through the same medium (television) used by the city in making
its offer.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. The resolution is an offer of a reward made to the general public. A reasonable
interpretation of its words and the circumstances surrounding its broadcast on television indicate that it is
inviting anyone to provide the information necessary to arrest and convict. 

A is incorrect because the language of the reward and the nature of a reward indicate that performance is
invited and not promissory acceptance. B is incorrect because it is not reasonable to interpret the words of the
reward as requiring actual arrest and participation in the prosecution of an individual when the offer of reward
receives such widespread broadcast to the general public. D is incorrect because in order for an offer to
require a particular mode of acceptance, it must be clearly stated in the offer. If the offer is silent as to mode of
acceptance, a test of reasonableness applies. It would not be reasonable to require such an unorthodox and
unavailable mode of acceptance. In this case, a reasonable interpretation of the offer is to require
performance, not a promissory acceptance.

With respect to duration, the city's reward offer was terminable 

A: by lapse of time, on December 31 of the year in which it was made.
B: not by lapse of time, but only by effective revocation.
C: not by revocation, but only by lapse of a reasonable time.
D: either by lapse of a reasonable time or earlier by effective revocation.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Revocation of general offers made to the public must be given publicity equal to that
given to the offer and no better means of notification should be reasonably available. If the offer is not revoked,
as with ordinary offers, a general offer will lapse after a reasonable time. A is incorrect because the offer was
also revocable and there are no facts to support that December 31st was a reasonable time as to lapse. B is
incorrect because the rules of lapse also apply to general offers made to the public. C is incorrect because
general offers may be revoked so long as the revocation is given publicity equal to that given the offer and no
better means of notification of revocation is reasonably available.

The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed

employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay
the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its
reward. 

Which of the following best characterizes the relationship between the store and the detective? 

A: A unilateral offer of employment by the store which became irrevocable for a reasonable number of days
after the detective commenced his investigation of the store's arson.
B: An employment for compensation subject to a condition precedent that the detective succeeds in his
investigation.
C: A series of daily bilateral contracts, the store exchanging an express promise to pay the daily rate for the
detective's implied promise to pursue his investigation with reasonable diligence.
D: A series of daily unilateral contracts, the store exchanging an express promise to pay the daily rate for the
detective's daily activity of investigating the store's arson.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The written memorandum called for the detective to "perform" by "investigating the fire."
Thus, it was unilateral, and it specified a daily rate of pay for "each day's work." 

A is incorrect because an option contract at law is created when the offeree begins performance in response to
a unilateral offer, which makes the offer irrevocable to allow the offeree a reasonable opportunity to complete
performance. Given the language "for each day's work you actually perform," a reasonable opportunity would
not extend beyond a single day. B is incorrect because the language does not expressly require that the
detective successfully investigate before the duty to pay will arise, but instead states that the detective will be
paid for each day's investigation. C is incorrect because the language of the offer calls for performance, not a
promise, and every contract, whether unilateral or bilateral, imposes upon parties a duty of good faith and fair
dealing in its performance and its enforcement.

Question 152 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties

 The question was: 

On March 1, a mechanic agreed to repair an owner's machine for $5,000, to be paid on completion of the
work. On March 15, before the work was completed, the mechanic sent a letter to the owner with a copy to the
mechanic's creditor, telling the owner to pay $5,000 to the creditor. The mechanic then completed the work. 

Which of the following, if true, would best serve the owner as a defense in an action brought against him by the
creditor for $5,000? 

A: The creditor was incapable of performing the mechanic's work.
B: The mechanic had not performed his work in a workmanlike manner.
C: On March 1, the mechanic had promised the owner that he would not assign the contract.
D: The creditor was not the intended beneficiary of the mechanic-owner contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The mechanic was not entitled to payment unless he satisfied his contractual duties, and
every contract for work or services contains an implied duty to perform in good faith or in a workmanlike
manner. A is incorrect because the mechanic was not delegating his duties to the creditor under the contract;
he was assigning his right to payment. C is incorrect because contract rights are freely assignable unless
assignment is specifically precluded by the agreement, and the contract is silent as to assignment. D is
incorrect because an assignee can recover from an obligor. If there was a valid assignment of payment to the
creditor from the mechanic, and the mechanic performed, then the creditor can sue the owner for payment.

Question 153 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A manufacturer of computers pays its salespeople a salary of $1,000 per month and a commission of 5
percent on billings actually rendered for machines that they sell. The manufacturer's sales people are
employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission, the
salesperson must be in the employment of the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer. 

In 2006, a salesperson for the manufacturer worked for eight months to get an order from a large corporation
for a $750,000 computer. He consulted extensively with the corporation's top executives and worked with its
operating personnel to develop detailed specifications for the new equipment. He also promised the
corporation, with the manufacturer's knowledge and approval, to assist the corporation for six months after
installation in making the equipment work. 

On January 1, 2007, the corporation signed an order, and on March 1, the computer was installed. On March
15, the manufacturer fired the salesperson on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 2005 and 2006
sales quotas. The salesperson thought that the manufacturer was correct in this statement. A coworker was
thereupon assigned to service the large corporation's account. On March 31, manufacturer billed the
corporation for the computer. 

Assume that the manufacturer's termination of the salesperson's employment was not wrongful. If the
salesperson, after demand and refusal, sues the manufacturer for the corporation sale commission, which of
the following is the most likely to result? 

A: The salesperson will win, because he had procured the sale of the computer.
B: The salesperson will win, because he had promised the corporation that he would assist in making the
equipment work.
C: The manufacturer will win, because the coworker is entitled to the commission on a quantum meruit basis.
D: The manufacturer will win, because the salesperson was not employed as the manufacturer's salesperson
when the company was billed for the computer.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. An express contractual condition to recovery of the commission requires that a sales
person be employed by the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer. A is incorrect because although
the salesperson had procured the sale, his written employment agreement required that he also be employed
by the manufacturer when the bill was sent to the customer. B is incorrect because the salesperson's oral
promise to a third party cannot modify an express condition in his contract with his employer. C is also
incorrect because although the coworker will be entitled to the sale commission, the express written contract
with the manufacturer would be the basis of payment, not an equitable theory.

Question 154 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A manufacturer of computers pays its salespeople a salary of $1,000 per month and a commission of 5
percent on billings actually rendered for machines that they sell. The manufacturer's sales people are
employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission, the
salesperson must be in the employment of the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer. 

In 2006, a salesperson for the manufacturer worked for eight months to get an order from a large corporation

On January 1, 2007, the corporation signed an order, and on March 1, the computer was installed. On March
15, the manufacturer fired the salesperson on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 2005 and 2006
sales quotas. The salesperson thought that the manufacturer was correct in this statement. A coworker was
thereupon assigned to service the corporation account. On March 31, the manufacturer billed the corporation
for the computer. 

Assume that the manufacturer's termination of the salesperson's employment was not wrongful. If the
salesperson sues the manufacturer for the reasonable value of his services, which of the following is the most
likely result? 

A: The salesperson will win, because the manufacturer benefited as a result of the salesperson's services.
B: The salesperson will win, because the manufacturer made an implied-in-fact promise to pay a reasonable
commission for services that result in sales.
C: The salesperson will lose, because there is an express contractual provision pre-empting the subject of
compensation for his services.
D: The salesperson will lose, because he cannot perform his agreement to assist the customer for six months.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. The express terms of the contract control the salesperson's right to recovery and his
reasonable expectations. A is incorrect because the salesperson was being paid a monthly salary for his
services. When the salesperson conferred a benefit to the manufacturer, he had no reasonable expectation of
the sale commission unless he met the express terms of his agreement. B is incorrect because the
manufacturer's express contract with the salesperson is inconsistent with an implied agreement to pay a
reasonable commission, and the express language controls. D is incorrect because the salesperson's right to
the commission is not dependent upon servicing the contract; rather, it is dependent upon his employment
status on the date that the customer is billed.

Question 165 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

A new business enterprise about to commence the manufacture of clothing, entered into a written agreement
to purchase all of its monthly requirements of a certain elasticized fabric for a period of three years from a
fabric company at a specified unit price, and agreed upon delivery and payment terms. The agreement also
provided: 
1. The parties covenant not to assign this contract. 

2. Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business
enterprise to the creditor of the fabric company. The fabric company promptly made an "assignment of the
contract" to a finance company as security for a $100,000 loan. The new enterprise subsequently ordered,
took delivery of, and paid the fabric company the agreed price ($5,000) for the new enterprise's requirement of
the fabric for the first month of its operation. 

Assume that the assignment from the fabric company to the finance company was effective, and that the
creditor did not become aware of the original agreement between the new business enterprise and the fabric
company until after the fabric company's acceptance of the $5,000 payment from the new business enterprise.
Which of the following is correct? 

A: The creditor was an incidental beneficiary of the new business enterprise-fabric company agreement.
B: The creditor has a prior right to the new business enterprise's $5,000 payment as against either the fabric
company or the finance company.
C: The creditor was an incidental beneficiary of the new business enterprise-fabric company agreement and
has a prior right to the new business enterprise's $5,000 payment as against either the fabric company or the
finance company.
D: The creditor was not an incidental beneficiary of the new business enterprise-fabric company agreement
and does not have a prior right to the new business enterprise's $5,000 payment as against either the fabric
company or the finance company.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The creditor was not an incidental beneficiary of the new business enterprise-fabric
company agreement because an incidental beneficiary is one who fortuitously and incidentally anticipates a
benefit resulting from a transaction between others. Pursuant to the express language of the agreement,
payments were to be made directly to the creditor for two months, rendering payment not fortuitous, but
deliberately contemplated by the agreement. The creditor does not have a prior right to the new business
enterprise's $5,000 payment as against either the fabric company or the finance company because although
the creditor is an intended creditor beneficiary of the fabric company, it had no knowledge of its rights under
the contract. Without knowledge, there could be no justifiable reliance or assent, so the right to payment under
the contract had not vested. Therefore, D is correct, while A, B, and C are incorrect.

A new business enterprise about to commence the manufacture of clothing entered into a written agreement to
purchase all of its monthly requirements of a certain elasticized fabric for a period of three years from a fabric
company at a specified unit price and agreed delivery and payment terms. The agreement also provided: 
1. The parties covenant not to assign this contract. 

2. Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business

took delivery of, and paid the fabric company the agreed price ($5,000) for the new enterprise's requirement of
the fabric for the first month of its operation. 

Two weeks after making the $5,000 payment to the fabric company, the new business enterprise, by written
notice to the fabric company, terminated the agreement for purchase of the elasticized fabric because market
conditions had in fact forced the new business enterprise out of the clothing manufacture business. In an
immediate suit by the finance company against the new business enterprise for total breach, which of the
following would be useful in the new business enterprise's defense? 

A: The fabric company's rights under its agreement with the new business enterprise were personal and
therefore nonassignable.
B: The fabric company's "assignment of the contract" to the finance company to secure a loan would normally
be interpreted as a delegation of the fabric company's duties under the contract as well as an assignment of its
rights; and its duties, owed to the new business enterprise, were personal and therefore non-delegable.
C: The original contract between the new business enterprise and the fabric company was unenforceable by
either party for want of legally sufficient consideration for the fabric company's promise to supply the new
business enterprise's requirements of the elasticized fabric.
D: the new business enterprise ceased in good faith to have any further requirements for elasticized fabric.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. A party's obligations under a requirements contract subject to the UCC are measured by
good faith. A shut-down by a requirements buyer due to lack of orders or market conditions meets the good
faith standard. 

A is incorrect because unless there are circumstances suggesting otherwise, a clause prohibiting the
assignment of the "contract" will be construed as barring only the delegation of the assignor's duties. See UCC
§2-210. Therefore, the clause would not affect the assignment of payment made by the fabric company to the
finance company. Furthermore, a party's contractual right is only personal where the nature of the contract is
such that the assignment would impair the other party's reasonable expectations or would offend public policy.
Assignment of a right to payment of money is not the assignment of a personal right. 

B is incorrect because the "assignment of the contract" was expressly made to a creditor of the fabric
company. Rights are assigned and duties are delegated. The use of "assignment" language, and the fact that
the assignment was made to a creditor, reasonably indicates that the fabric company did not delegate its
duties under the contract. C is incorrect because consideration exists in the form of a legal detriment to the
new business enterprise as the enterprise has parted with the legal right to buy elasticized fabric from another
source.

Question 167 - Contracts - Discharge of Contractual Duties

 The question was: 

A landowner owned a vacant lot known as Richacre. The landowner entered into a written contract with a
builder to build a house of stated specifications on Richacre and to sell the house and lot to the builder. The
contract provided for an "inside date" of April 1, 2007 and an "outside date" of May 1, 2007, for completion of
the house and delivery of a deed. Neither party tendered performance on the dates stated. On May 3, 2007,
the builder notified the landowner in writing of the builder's election to cancel the contract because of the
landowner's failure to deliver title by May 1. On May 12, the landowner notified the builder that some
unanticipated construction difficulties had been encountered but that the landowner was entitled to a
reasonable time to complete. The notification also included a promise that the landowner would be ready to
perform by May 29 and that he was setting that date as an adjourned closing date. The landowner obtained a
certificate of occupancy and appropriate documents of title, and he tendered performance on May 29. The
builder refused. The landowner brought an action to recover damages for breach of contract. The decision in
the case will most likely be determined by whether 

A: The landowner acted with due diligence in completing the house.
B: The builder can prove actual "undue hardship" caused by the delay.
C: the expressions "inside date" and "outside date" are construed to make time of the essence.
D: there is a showing of good faith in the builder's efforts to terminate the contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. If this language is construed as making time of the essence, it becomes an express
condition to the builder's obligation to pay. The landowner's failure to meet this condition would discharge the
builder's duty to perform. 

A is incorrect because acting with due diligence will not excuse the failure to perform on time if the nature of
the contract makes timely performance essential. B is incorrect because proving the delay created an undue
hardship on the buyer would not be a factor in determining if the failure of the landowner to provide timely
performance was a material breach of the contract. D is incorrect because the builder's right to terminate is
dependent upon whether the breach was material. The existence of good faith in the builder's efforts to
terminate are irrelevant as there is no evidence that the builder attempted to frustrate timely completion.

Question 180 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties

 The question was: 

A painter, who has been in the painting business for ten years and has a fine reputation, contracts to paint a
farmer's barn. The farmer's barn is a standard red barn with a loft. The contract has no provision regarding
assignment. 

If the painter assigns the contract to a contractor, who has comparable experience and reputation, which of the
following statements is correct? 

A: The painter is in breach of contract.
B: The farmer may refuse to accept performance by the contractor.
C: The farmer is required to accept performance by the contractor.
D: There is a novation.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Unless the contract provides otherwise, a contractual duty may be delegated to another
unless the other party to the contract has a substantial interest in having the original obligor perform. Typically
the other party will have a substantial interest where the contract is a personal services contract involving
aesthetic taste and judgment. Although the painter-farmer contract is one for personal services (painting), the
item to be painted is a standard barn and the work will be done by a painter of comparable experience and
reputation. Therefore, the painter's delegation of the duty was not a breach, even if it was done without the
consent of the farmer, and if the farmer refuses performance by the contractor, he will be in breach of contract.
A and B are thus incorrect. D is incorrect because the mere delegation of a duty, does not create a novation; a
novation would require an express agreement by all parties to substitute the contractor for the painter.

Question 181 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties

 The question was: 

A painter, who has been in the painting business for ten years and has a fine reputation, contracts to paint the
farmer's barn. The farmer's barn is a standard red barn with a loft. The contract has no provision regarding
assignment. 

If the painter assigns the contract to a contractor and thereafter the contractor does not meet the contract
specifications in painting the farmer's barn, the farmer 

A: has a cause of action against the painter for damages.
B: has a cause of action only against the contractor for damages.
C: has a cause of action against the painter for damages only after he has first exhausted his remedies
against the contractor.
D: does not have a cause of action against the painter for damages, because he waived his rights against the
painter by permitting the contractor to perform the work.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Unless the other party to the contract (the farmer) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a
novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual
duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor (the painter). Therefore, where the duty to
paint the farmer's barn has been delegated and the delegatee (the contractor) breaches the duty by failing to
meet contract specifications, the farmer may enforce the contract against the original obligor (the painter). 

B and D are incorrect because, although the farmer may also enforce the obligation against the contractor
(since the farmer is the intended beneficiary of the agreement that delegated the duty), delegation does not
discharge the painter of his obligation to the farmer. C is incorrect because the farmer has a right to enforce
the obligation against either party.

Question 186 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A buyer purchased 100 bolts of standard blue wool, No. 1 quality, from a seller. The sales contract provided
that the buyer would make payment prior to inspection. The 100 bolts were shipped, and the buyer paid the
seller. Upon inspection, however, the buyer discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. The buyer thereupon
tendered back the wool to the seller and demanded return of his payment. The seller refused on the ground
that there is no difference between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool. 

Which of the following statements regarding the contract provision for preinspection payment is correct? 

A: It constitutes an acceptance of the goods.
B: It constitutes a waiver of the buyer's remedy of private sale in the case of nonconforming goods.
C: It does not impair a buyer's right of inspection or his remedies.
D: It is invalid.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Pursuant to UCC 2-512(2), if the contract requires payment before inspection, payment
does not constitute acceptance or impair a buyer's right to inspect or any of the buyer's remedies. For this
reason both A and B are incorrect. D is incorrect because such payment provisions are valid pursuant to UCC
2-512(1).

seller. Upon inspection, however, the buyer discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. The buyer thereupon
tendered back the wool to the seller and demanded return of his payment. The seller refused on the ground
that there is no difference between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool. 

What is the buyer's remedy because the wool was nonconforming? 

A: Specific performance
B: Damages measured by the difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of
conforming goods
C: Damages measured by the price paid plus the difference between the contract price and the cost of buying
substitute goods
D: None, since he waived his remedies by agreeing to pay before inspection

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct because a buyer is entitled to reject nonconforming goods and to obtain damages
pursuant to UCC 2-712(2), which is calculated as the difference between the cost of cover for substitute goods
and the contract price. A is incorrect because there are no facts to support a conclusion that blue wool No. 1
quality is unique or that there are other proper circumstances pursuant to UCC 2-716(1), such as an inability to
cover. B is incorrect. The difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of conforming
goods is the appropriate remedy under UCC 2-714 for accepted goods and the buyer tendered back the
goods. D is also incorrect because payment prior to inspection does not constitute an acceptance or a waiver
of any contract remedies under UCC 2-512(2).

Can the buyer resell the wool? 

A: Yes, in a private sale.
B: Yes, in a private sale but only after giving the seller reasonable notice of his intention to resell.
C: yes, but only at a public sale.
D: No.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. Pursuant to UCC 2-711(3) and 2-706(3), the buyer had a security interest in the goods
and had a right to resell. Thus, D is incorrect. A is incorrect because the buyer's right to resell at a private sale
exists only if the seller is given reasonable notice. C is incorrect because the sale may be either public or
private - UCC 2-706(2).

Question 199 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

Two salesmen, who lived in different suburbs twenty miles apart, were golfing acquaintances at the Interurban
Country Club. Both were traveling salesmen--one for a pharmaceutical company and the other for a widget
manufacturer. The pharmaceutical salesman wrote the widget salesman by United States mail on Friday,
October 8: 

I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club and will buy your Sujocki for $1,200 upon your
bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or before noon, November 12 next. This
offer is not subject to countermand. 

Sincerely, 

[signed] the pharmaceutical salesman 

The widget salesman replied by mail the following day: 

I accept your offer, and promise to deliver the bike as you specified. 

Sincerely, 

[signed] the widget salesman 

This letter, although properly addressed, was misdirected by the postal service and not received by the
pharmaceutical salesman until November 10. The pharmaceutical salesman had bought another Sujocki bike
from a different friend for $1,050 a few hours before. 

The friend saw the widget salesman at the Interurban Country Club on November 11 and said: "I sold my
Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman yesterday for $1,050. Would you consider selling me yours for $950?"
The widget salesman replied: "I'll let you know in a few days." 

On November 12, the widget salesman took his Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman's residence; he
arrived at 11:15 a.m. The pharmaceutical salesman was asleep and did not answer the ringing doorbell until
12:15 p.m. The pharmaceutical salesman then rejected the widget salesman's bike on the ground that he had
already bought someone else's bike. 

In the pharmaceutical salesman's letter of October 8, what was the legal effect of the language: "This offer is
not subject to countermand"? 

A: Under the Uniform Commercial Code the offer was irrevocable until noon, November 12.
B: Such language prevented an effective acceptance by the widget salesman prior to noon, November 12.
C: At common law, such language created a binding option in the widget salesman's favor.
D: Such language did not affect the offeror's power of revocation of the offer.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. No consideration was paid for the option, and the pharmaceutical salesman is not a
merchant, so the UCC's firm offer rule does not apply. Therefore, the language has no effect and the offer
remained freely revocable. 

A is incorrect because UCC 2-205 limits the firm offer rule to merchants. Because the pharmaceutical
salesman does not deal in motorcycles or otherwise hold himself out by occupation as having knowledge or
skill specific to the goods involved in the transaction, he will not be considered a merchant under the UCC.
See (UCC 2-104). 

B is incorrect because the language, "This offer is not subject to countermand," relates to the pharmaceutical

from a different friend for $1,050 a few hours before.

12:15 p.m. The pharmaceutical salesman then rejected the widget salesman's bike on the ground that he had
already bought someone else's bike. 

In a lawsuit by the widget salesman against the pharmaceutical salesman for breach of contract, what would
the court probably decide regarding the widget salesman's letter of October 9? 

A: The letter bound both parties to a unilateral contract as soon as the widget salesman mailed it.
B: Mailing of the letter by the widget salesman did not, of itself, prevent a subsequent, effective revocation by
the pharmaceutical salesman of his offer.
C: The letter bound both parties to a bilateral contract, but only when received by the pharmaceutical
salesman on November 10.
D: Regardless of whether the pharmaceutical salesman's offer had proposed a unilateral or a bilateral
contract, the letter was an effective acceptance upon receipt, if not upon dispatch.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The widget salesman's letter was not an appropriate method of acceptance because the
pharmaceutical salesman's letter offer requested performance; thus, the mail box rule would not apply to make
the acceptance effective upon dispatch, and the pharmaceutical salesman's offer remained freely revocable. A
is incorrect because the letter could not be reasonably construed as the beginning of performance. C is
incorrect because the offer called for a unilateral acceptance. D is also incorrect because the offer did not
invite the widget salesman to choose between acceptance by promise and acceptance by performance.

Question 220 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

On May 1 a lot owner telegraphed a buyer, "Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grover subdivision at $5,000
each. Details will follow in letter." The letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of payment,
insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, "This offer remains open until June 1." 

On May 2, after he had received the telegram but before he had received the letter, the buyer telegraphed the
owner, "Accept your offer with respect to lot 101." Both parties knew that there were fifty lots in the Grover
subdivision and that they were numbered 101 through 150. 

Assume that on May 5 the owner telephoned the buyer to explain that he had sold lots 102 through 150 to
someone else on May 4 and that the buyer thereafter telegraphed the owner, "Will take the rest of the lots."
Assume further that there is no controlling statute. In an action by the buyer against the owner for breach of
contract, the buyer probably will 

A: succeed, because the owner had promised him that the offer would remain open until June 1.
B: succeed, because the owner's attempted revocation was by telephone.
C: not succeed, because the buyer's power of acceptance was terminated by the owner's sale of the lots to
another party.
D: not succeed, because the buyer's power of acceptance was terminated by an effective revocation.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The owner's telephone call on May 5 informing the buyer that the remaining lots had been
sold was a manifestation of the owner's intention not to enter into a contract with the buyer for the remaining
lots and thus a revocation of his May 1 offer. 

A is incorrect because there was no consideration to support an option to keep the offer open for a definite
time. B is incorrect because the owner's telephone call to the buyer on May 5 served as actual notification of
the revocation. C is incorrect because the sale to someone else would constitute indirect notice of revocation
only if buyer also received reliable information of the sale; in this case, however, the owner's telephone call on
May 5 was the only notice of revocation that the buyer received.

insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, "This offer remains open until June 1."

subdivision and that they were numbered 101 through 150. 

Assume that on May 6 the buyer telegraphed the owner, "Will take the rest of the lots," and that on May 8 the
owner discovered that he did not have good title to the remaining lots. Which of the following would provide the
best legal support to the owner's contention that he was not liable for breach of contract as to the remaining
forty-nine lots? 

A: Impossibility of performance
B: Unilateral mistake as to basic assumption
C: Termination of the offer by the buyer's having first contracted to buy lot 101
D: Excuse by failure of an implied condition precedent.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. When the buyer accepted the owner's offer to buy lot 101 on May 2, he implicitly rejected
the offer to purchase the remaining lots, and his rejection terminated his power of acceptance as to the
remaining lots. A is incorrect because at the time the contract was made on May 2, the owner either had
reason to know that he did not have good title to the remaining lots or he was at fault in not knowing, and thus
his performance would not be excused as impossible or impracticable. B is incorrect because both parties
were mistaken as to the owner's interest in the property. D is incorrect because, although the law does imply a
condition into the agreement that the owner convey marketable title, the owner's failure to do so allows the
buyer to elect to either rescind or to take title with the defect and to pay the full purchase price.

Question 242 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

A victim, injured by a driver in an auto accident, employed an attorney to represent him in the matter. The
victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical
treatment. Accordingly, the attorney wrote into their contract his promise to the victim "to pay from any
settlement with the driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for the victim's
injuries." The contract also provided that the attorney's duties were "non-assignable." The attorney
immediately filed suit against the driver. The victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably
valued at $1,000, from the doctor, but failed to inform the doctor of the attorney's promise. 

After receiving a bill from the doctor for $1,000, the victim immediately wrote the doctor explaining that he was
unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with the attorney. 

The victim then asked the attorney about payment of this bill, but the attorney requested a release from their
employment contract, stating that he would like to refer the victim's claim to a colleague and that the colleague
was willing to represent the victim in the pending lawsuit. The victim wrote a letter to the attorney releasing him
from their contract and agreeing to the colleague's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to the doctor.
The colleague subsequently promised the attorney to represent the victim and soon negotiated a settlement of
the victim's claim against the driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by the victim to creditors other
than the doctor. The victim remains insolvent. 

In an action by the doctor against the attorney upon the attorney's employment contract with the victim, if the
attorney attempted to use the victim's release as a defense, the doctor is likely to argue that 

A: the release was ineffective, because the doctor had impliedly assented to the victim-attorney contract.
B: the release was ineffective, because the victim would thereby be unjustly enriched.
C: there was no consideration for the victim's release of the attorney.
D: the attorney's contract duties were too personal to be effectively delegated to the colleague.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an
intended beneficiary until the beneficiary's rights vest. Rights vest when the beneficiary: (1) manifests assent to
the promise, (2) sues to enforce the promise, or (3) materially changes position in reliance on the promise.
Here, the doctor was an intended beneficiary of the agreement between the victim and the attorney. Although
the doctor received notice of the promise before the victim and the attorney executed the release, he never
expressly assented to the promise. However, the doctor can argue that by not pursuing the victim and waiting
to collect from the attorney, the doctor impliedly assented to the contract and that assent made the release
ineffective. 

B is incorrect because unjust enrichment is not relevant to the question of whether the attorney was released,
and would only be relevant in a quasi-contract action against the victim. C is incorrect because the colleague's
promise to represent the victim supplied sufficient consideration to support the promise to release the attorney.
D is incorrect because the question of whether the attorney's duties may be freely delegated is irrelevant since
the victim assented to the delegation.

Question 250 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

On March 1, a landowner and builder orally agreed that the builder would erect a boathouse on the
landowner's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse, across a neighbor's lot, to a lake. The neighbor had
already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The
builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15, and to complete all the work before June 1. The
total price of $10,000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2,500 on March 15; $2,500 when
the boathouse was completed; $5,000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel. 

Assume that the landowner tendered the $2,500 on March 15, and that the builder refused to accept it or to
perform. In an action by the landowner against the builder for breach of contract, which of the following can the
builder successfully use as a defense?  

A: The neighbor-landowner agreement permitting the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot was not
in writing.
B: The landowner-builder agreement was not in writing.
C: The landowner-builder agreement was not in writing and the neighbor-landowner agreement permitting the
digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot was not in writing.
D: The builder does not have a defense.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Under the Statute of Frauds, a promise to sell an interest in land must meet the writing
and signing requirements of the statute to be enforceable. Although the land contract provision of the statute
has been broadly construed to include rights of way, the neighbor-landowner agreement does not fall within
the land contract provision because the neighbor's promise ("permitting the digging") was a gratuitous
conveyance and not a contract for sale. Similarly, a promise that cannot be performed within a year of its
making falls within the one-year provision of the statute. Because the landowner-builder agreement was made
on March 1 and the performance is to be completed by June 1, this agreement falls outside the one-year
provision since it can be performed within a year of its making. Because neither agreement falls within the
statute of frauds, the fact that the agreements were not in writing is not a valid defense. Therefore, A, B and C
are incorrect.

Assume that the landowner paid the $2,500 on March 15 and that the builder completed the boathouse
according to specifications, but that the landowner then refused to pay the second installment and repudiated
the contract. Assume further that the absence of a writing is not raised as a defense. Which of the following is
correct? 

A: The builder has a cause of action against the landowner and his damages will be $2,500.
B: The builder can refuse to dig the channel and not be liable for breach of contract.
C: The builder can refuse to dig the channel, not be liable for breach of contract, and have a cause of action
against the landowner for which his damages will be $2,500.
D: The builder can refuse to dig the channel but he will liable for breach of contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, an unequivocal statement of unwillingness
or inability to perform a future contractual obligation, if material, may be treated as a total breach of that
obligation. Once a repudiation occurs, the non-repudiating party is discharged from any further performance
under the contract and may immediately recover damages for total breach. When a contractor is injured due to
an owner's total breach of a construction contract, the contractor generally can recover his expected profit on
the entire contract along with any labor and material expenses incurred up until the time that he learned of the
owner's breach, minus any progress payments made by the owner. Although the landowner repudiated the
agreement just after the second $2,500 progress payment became due, the builder would be entitled to obtain
as damages not only the progress payment but also his expected profit on the entire contract. Because these
damages would exceed $2,500, answers A and C are incorrect. The builder is also entitled to withhold his
remaining performance under the contract and will not be considered in breach. Therefore, answer D is
incorrect, making B the correct answer.

Question 264 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A father had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son and his son's fiancée a house on their wedding
day, planned for June 10, 2002. Pursuant to that promise, the father telephoned his old contractor-friend on
May 1, 2001, and made the following oral agreement--each making full and accurate written notes thereof: 

The contractor was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned
by the father, and the father was to pay therefore $20 per tree. The contractor agreed further to build a house
on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of
$18,000. The father agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning
August 1, 2001, upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders, Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5
were being met. 

The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001, when he also began building the house. The
father made three $2,000 payments for the work done in July, August, and September 2001, without requiring
a certificate. The contractor worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 2001, to the
end of February 2002, because of bad weather, and the father made no payments during that period. The
contractor did not object. On March 1, 2002, the contractor demanded payment of $2,000; but the father
refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no
certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. 

Assuming that the contractor committed a total breach on March 1, 2002, and assuming further that he was
aware when the agreement was made of the purpose for which the father wanted the completed house, which
of the following, if true, would best support the father's claim for consequential damages on account of delay
beyond June 10, 2002, in getting the house finished? 

A: The son and his bride, married on June 10, 2002, would have to pay storage charges on their wedding gifts
and new furniture until the house could be completed.
B: The son's fiancée jilted the son on June 10, 2002, and ran off with another man who had a new house.
C: The father was put to additional expense in providing his son and the son's bride, married on June 10,
2002, with temporary housing.
D: On June 10, 2002, the father paid a $5,000 judgment obtained against him in a suit filed March 15, 2002, by
an adjoining landowner on account of the father's negligent excavation, including blasting, in an attempt to
finish the house himself after the contractor's repudiation.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. In addition to direct expectation recovery, the father would be entitled to damages for
consequential loss because the contractor knew of the special circumstances for which the house was being
built and the deadline giving rise to these damages for delay. 

A is incorrect because the father's promise was to furnish the son and the son's wife a home on their wedding
day. His consequential damages would be limited to further losses to him, which were dependent upon the
contract. His legally binding agreement with the son and the son's fiancé would give rise to direct liability for
their damages, but not his agreement with the contractor. B is incorrect because this incident is not a
consequence of or caused by the contractor's breach or reasonably foreseeable as a result of the contractor's
breach. D is incorrect because the father's negligent attempt at mitigation to prevent consequential loss is not
compensable because the father did not act reasonably in choosing self-help as substitute performance.

Question 265 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A father had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son and the son's fiancé a house on their wedding
day, planned for June 10, 2002. Pursuant to that promise, the father telephoned his old contractor-friend on
May 1, 2001, and made the following oral agreement--each making full and accurate written notes thereof: 

The contractor was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned
by the father, and the father was to pay therefore $20 per tree. The contractor agreed further to build a house
on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of
$18,000. The father agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning
August 1, 2001, upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders, Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5
were being met. 

The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001, when he also began building the house. The
father made three $2,000 payments for the work done in July, August, and September 2001, without requiring
a certificate. The contractor worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 2001, to the
end of February 2002, because of bad weather, and the father made no payments during that period. The
contractor did not object. On March 1, 2002, the contractor demanded payment of $2,000, but the father
refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no
certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. 

The contractor failed to object to the father's failure to make payments on November 1, December 1, January
1, and February 1. Additionally, the father's made payments in August through October without requiring a
certificate from Builders. What was the probable legal effect of these action?  

A: Estoppel-type waiver as to both the contractor's failure to object and the father's payments without requiring
a certificate.
B: Waiver of delay in payment as to the contractor's failure to object and revocable waiver as to the father's
payments without requiring a certificate.
C: Mutual rescission of the contract.
D: Discharge of the father's duty to make the four payments as to the contractor's failure to object and
estoppel-type waiver as to the father's payments with requiring a certificate.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The condition in the contract fixing the time for payment was not a material part of the
agreed exchange and therefore was subject to repeated waiver when the contractor failed to object as each of
the four months passed without payment. By doing so, the contractor voluntarily abandoned this contractual
condition for these months. The condition requiring a monthly certification prior to payment was waived by the
father each time he made monthly payments without requiring certification. However, the father would be
permitted to revoke the waiver and reinstate the certification condition as to future payments if he allowed the
contractor reasonable time to obtain the certificates and if the contractor had not detrimentally relied upon the
waiver. 

A is incorrect because neither the contractor nor the father, by failing to assert the condition, caused the other
to detrimentally rely on the fact that the condition would not be asserted. As to the contractor's failure to
demand monthly payment, he had done no work during these months due to bad weather, and this would not
indicate that he would not demand payment when he once again began working. As to the father's waiver of
certificate each month, the father retained the ultimate right to inspect before taking possession; thus, the
contractor could not have detrimentally relied upon the failure to issue certificates. 

C is incorrect because the contractor and the father did not make an agreement to rescind; this would be
necessary given the fact that their waivers of condition resulted in the contract remaining enforceable. 

D is incorrect because the contractor did not manifest an intent to discharge the father's duty to pay when he
failed to insist on monthly payments during a time in which he could not perform.

Question 288 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A building owner and a purchaser made a written contract pursuant to which the building owner promised to
convey a specified apartment house to the purchaser in return for the purchaser's promise (1) to convey a
100-acre farm to the building owner, and (2) to pay the building owner $1,000 in cash six months after the
exchange of the apartment house and the farm. The contract contained the following provision: "It is
understood and agreed that the purchaser's obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchange of the
apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the building owner has not, within three months after the
aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of the said apartment house." 

The building owner's removal of the shed from the parking area of the apartment house is 

A: a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000.
B: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000.
C: a condition subsequent to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000.
D: not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is the correct answer. This question deals with the difference between conditions precedent, conditions
concurrent, and conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty
of immediate performance arises in the other party. Conditions concurrent are conditions the can occur
together with both parties bound to perform at the same time. A condition subsequent is one which cuts off an
existing duty of performance when it occurs. Here, the obligation to remove the shed will give rise to the
purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000. Therefore, it functions as a condition precedent to that duty. However, the
condition is worded so the failure to remove the shed by the three month deadline will extinguish the
purchaser's obligation to pay the $1,000, making it a condition subsequent in form. Thus, A is the appropriate
response and B, C and D are incorrect.

Question 291 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A lender contended that a borrower owed him $6,000. The borrower denied that he owed the lender anything.
Tired of the dispute, the borrower eventually signed a promissory note by which he promised to pay the lender
$5,000 in settlement of their dispute. 

In an action by the lender against the borrower on the promissory note, which of the following, if true, would
afford the borrower the best defense? 

A: Although the lender honestly believed that $6,000 was owed by the borrower, the borrower knew that it was
not owed.
B: Although the lender knew that the debt was not owed, the borrower honestly was in doubt whether it was
owed.
C: The original claim was based on an oral agreement, which the Statute of Frauds required to be in writing.
D: The original claim was an action on a contract, which was barred by the applicable Statute of Limitations.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. Unilateral modifications of contractual obligations lack consideration under the preexisting
duty rule and therefore may be unenforceable. However, a promise to surrender a legal claim is sufficient
consideration to support a return promise even if the claim turns out to be invalid, so long as the person
surrendering the claim has a good faith belief in its validity. Because the borrower may argue that the unilateral
modification of the debt is unenforceable due to the preexisting duty rule, the lender may argue that his
promise to settle the claim provided sufficient consideration. The lender's argument will not succeed, however,
if the lender knew that the claim was not valid. 

A is incorrect because, since it is the lender's promise to settle that must furnish the necessary consideration, it
is his good faith belief in the claim's validity that is relevant. C and D are incorrect because the issue is not the
actual validity of the claim, but whether the lender genuinely believed in its validity.

Question 299 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

A professor said to the president of a secretarial service, "Since you folks have done good typing work for me
in the past, I promise to bring you the manuscript for my new book." 

"When?" asked the president. 

"First chapter next Monday," replied the professor. 

"Wouldn't that be nice," said the president. 

The following Monday the professor, foregoing the services of another secretarial service, brought chapter one
to the secretarial service's office but the president refused to take it, saying that they were all booked up for
three weeks. 

Which of the following facts or inferences would be most helpful in an action by the professor against the
secretarial service? 

A: "When" and "Wouldn't that be nice" implied a promise to type the manuscript.
B: The professor relied on the president's statement by bringing the manuscript to her service's office.
C: The secretarial service had done good work for the professor in the past.
D: The professor had foregone the services of another secretarial service.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. An implied-in-fact contract is an enforceable contract based on a tacit, rather than an
express, promise. An implied-in-fact promise may be inferred from parties' conduct or from their statements
when interpreted in the context of broader circumstances. Although the president did not expressly promise
that she would type the professor's manuscript on the following Monday in exchange for payment, such an
exchange may fairly be implied from the broader context of her responses to the professor's statements. 

B and D are incorrect because in order for the professor to enforce the president's promise on a detrimental
reliance theory, he would need to show that his change in position in reliance on the president's promise was
such a detriment that enforcement of the promise would be necessary to avoid injustice. C is incorrect
because the fact that the secretarial service did good work for the professor in the past does not in itself imply
a promise to do such work in the future.

Question 310 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

On November 1, the following notice was posted in a privately-operated law school: 

The faculty, seeking to encourage legal research, offers to any student at this school who wins the current
National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to
the Dean's office before May 1. A student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort
to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. The student also left on a counter
in the Dean's office a signed note saying, "I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer." This note
was inadvertently placed in a student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On
the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefore: 

The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. The
student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that the
student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to
pay anything. 

Assuming that the faculty's notice of November 1 was posted on a bulletin board or other conspicuous place
commonly viewed by all persons in the law school, such notice constituted a 

A: preliminary invitation to deal, analogous to newspaper advertisements for the sale of goods by merchants.
B: contractual offer, creating a power of acceptance.
C: preliminary invitation, because no offeree was named therein.
D: promise to make a conditional, future gift of money.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter a bargain, which is made in such a way
that the offeree is justified in thinking that her assent will conclude a bargain. Advertisements or
announcements directed to the public at large typically are construed as invitations to deal and not as offers, in
part out of concern that an open-ended offer to the public would expose the offeror to excessive liability. This
rationale will not apply, however, if the language in the announcement is qualified with limiting language such
as "first come first served." Because the faculty's $500 offer was limited to the winner of the competition, the
public posting of the faculty's notice may reasonably be construed to be an offer. 

A and C are incorrect because, as explained above, an advertisement or announcement may be construed as
an offer where the language of the offer is sufficiently definite. D is incorrect because the offer is not merely
gratuitous but seeks the return performance of competing in and winning the writing competition.

student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that the
student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $500. The law faculty refused to pay
anything. 

As to the student, was the offer effectively revoked? 

A: Yes, by the faculty's second notice.
B: No, because it became irrevocable after a reasonable time had elapsed.
C: No, because of the student's reliance, prior to April 1, on the offer.
D: No, because the student was aware of the April 1 posting.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Where an offer is for a unilateral contract (an offer that seeks only performance and does
not seek a return promise) and the offeree begins the invited performance, the offeror may not revoke the
promise. This rule is intended to protect the substantial reliance of the offeree that results when accepting an
offer for a unilateral contract by performance over a period of time. Because the faculty's offer of $500 sought
only performance (winning the competition) and did not seek a commitment to perform, it was an offer for a
unilateral contract. Once the student commenced performance, the faculty was not free to revoke the offer, so
its attempted revocation on April 1 was ineffective. 

Therefore A is incorrect. B is incorrect because the offer became irrevocable only when the student
commenced the requested performance. D is incorrect because the offer became irrevocable once the student
commenced performance, which occurred before April 1.

student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to

The offer proposed a 

A: unilateral contract only.
B: bilateral contract only.
C: unilateral contract or bilateral contract at the offeree's option.
D: unilateral contract which ripened into a bilateral contract, binding on both parties, as soon as the student
intensified his effort in response to the offer.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. An offer for a unilateral contract is one that seeks only performance and does not seek a
return promise as the means of acceptance. Under the modern view, most contracts are considered bilateral,
with two exceptions. A traditional unilateral contract occurs where: (1) the offeror clearly indicates that
completion of performance is the only manner of acceptance, or (2) the offer is made to the public, such as a
reward or contest offer. Here, the offer to the law student population constitutes an offer to the public, and is
the type of offer which clearly contemplates acceptance by performance. It would be unreasonable to consider
a promise a valid acceptance in the context of a contest. B, C, and D are incorrect because each suggests that
an offer to the public could reasonably be construed as an offer for a bilateral contract.

The faculty, seeking to encourage legal research, offers to any student at this school who wins the current
National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to

student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that the
student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to
pay anything. 

The promise of the faculty on November 1 was 

A: enforceable on principles of promissory estoppel.
B: enforceable by the student's personal representative even if the student had been killed in an accident on
April 16.
C: not enforceable on policy grounds because it produced a noncommercial agreement between a student and
his teachers, analogous to intramural family agreement and informal social commitments.
D: not enforceable, because the student, after entering the National Competition in October, was already
under a duty to perform to the best of his ability.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. An offer seeking only a performance and not a return promise is an offer for a unilateral
contract. Such an offer is accepted once the requested performance has been completed and notice of
acceptance has been given to the offeror. Once the offeree under a unilateral contract begins the invited
performance, the offeror may not revoke the promise; however, the offeror's obligation is conditioned upon the
offeree completing performance in accordance with the offer's terms. Even if the student were killed on April
16, the student's representative would still be entitled to enforce the faculty's promise because the requested
performance (completion of the winning research paper) was completed and because the faculty's attempt to
revoke the offer on April 1 was ineffective. 

A is incorrect because, although promissory estoppel may operate to enforce a promise made prior to the
conclusion of a contract, the better argument is that the student was successful in accepting the faculty's offer.
C is incorrect because the mere fact that a contract was concluded in a family or informal social setting does
not render it unenforceable on policy grounds. D is incorrect because the preexisting duty rule does not apply
where the duty is owed to a third party; therefore the student gave sufficient consideration to support the
promise.

Question 317 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A photographer and a customer entered a contract in writing on November 1, the essential part of which read
as follows: "[the photographer] to supply [the customer] with 200 personalized Christmas cards on or before
December 15, 2000, bearing a photograph of [the customer] and his family, and [the customer] to pay $100
thirty days thereafter. Photograph to be taken by [the photographer] at [the customer]'s house. Cards
guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time." Because the customer suddenly became ill, the photographer
was unable to take the necessary photograph of the customer and his family until the first week of December.
The final week's delay was caused by the photographer's not being notified promptly by the the customer of
his recovery. Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the
customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the
time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the
photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17,
the photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the
family, the customer refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm's length
without bothering to put on his reading glasses, "The photograph makes me look too old. Besides, the cards
weren't delivered on time." 

In an action by the photographer against the customer, which of the following would be the customer's best
defense? 

A: The cards, objectively viewed, were not satisfactory.
B: The cards, subjectively viewed, were not satisfactory.
C: The cards were not delivered on time.
D: The customer's illness excused him from further obligation under the contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. When a party's obligation under a contract is subject to a satisfaction condition, generally
the party may not avoid liability simply by expressing dissatisfaction with the performance - the dissatisfaction
must be expressed either reasonably or in good faith, depending on the nature of the obligation. Where the
performance at issue involves aesthetic taste and judgment (such as an obligation to take a family portrait or
holiday photo), the party whose obligation to pay is subject to the condition may only express dissatisfaction
honestly, or in good faith. Therefore, so long as the customer subjectively thought that the photograph was
unsatisfactory, he is discharged of his obligation to pay, even if a reasonable person would have been satisfied
with the work. 

A is incorrect because the customer's dissatisfaction with the work need not be objectively reasonable. C is
incorrect because the delay in delivery was excused by the customer's illness. D is incorrect, because the
customer's illness had the effect of excusing the delay but not of completely discharging the parties' remaining
obligations under the contract.

put on his reading glasses, "The photograph makes me look too old. Besides, the cards weren't delivered on
time." 

Which of the following statements regarding the legal effect of the customer's illness is LEAST accurate? 

A: The customer's illness and the related development excused the photographer from his obligations to
deliver the cards on or before December 15.
B: Prompt notice by the customer to the photographer of the customer's recovery from illness was an implied
condition of the photographer's duty under the circumstances.
C: The photographer was under a duty of immediate performance of his promise to deliver the cards, as of
December 15, by reason of the express language of the contract and despite the illness of the customer and
the related developments.
D: The customer's conduct after his illness constituted a waiver of the necessity of the photographer's
performing on or before December 15.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Where the existence of a particular person is necessary for the performance of a duty, his
incapacity, if sufficient to make performance impracticable, may operate to excuse performance of the
contract. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not
discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the contract between the customer and
the photographer required the photographer to take a photograph of "[the customer] and his family," the
customer's availability was necessary for the performance of the photographer's duty and therefore his illness
excused the photographer's delay in completing the cards by the December 15 due date. Since the
photographer had no way of knowing of the customer's recovery, his obligation to resume performance was
conditioned upon receiving notice of it. Although the customer might have taken the position that the delay
beyond December was material, thereby justifying the discharge of any further obligation, his conduct
(informing the photographer to "take the photograph anyway") amounted to a waiver of the December 15
deadline. Answer C is the least accurate statement since, as explained above, the customer's illness provided
a basis for excuse of the delay.

Question 333 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A man saved the life of his friend's wife who thereafter changed her will to leave the man $1,000. However,
upon the wife's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the
entirety of the husband. The property had been purchased by the husband from an inheritance. 

After the wife died, the husband signed and delivered to the man the following instrument: "In consideration of
[the man]'s saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I
hereby promise to pay [the man] $1,000." 

Upon the husband's death, the man filed a claim for $1,000. The husband's executor contested the claim on
the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration. 

In most states, would the man's saving of the wife's life be regarded as sufficient consideration for the
husband's promise? 

A: Yes, because the husband was thereby morally obligated to the man.
B: Yes, because the husband was thereby materially benefited.
C: No, because the husband had not asked the man to save her.
D: No, because the value of the man's act was too uncertain.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by bargained-for consideration.
Consideration is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor and given by the promisee in exchange for the
promise. Although the husband's promise states that it is given "in consideration of the man's saving" the wife's
life, in fact it is not sufficient consideration to support the husband's promise. The husband did not make the
promise to pay $1,000 in exchange for the man's act, nor did the man save the wife's life in exchange for the
husband's promise. 

A and B are incorrect because neither moral obligation nor material benefit alone is a sufficient basis for
finding consideration. D is incorrect because the respective values of consideration exchanged is not relevant
to whether consideration is sufficient; what matters is whether the consideration was bargained for.

Question 334 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A man saved the life of his friend's wife who thereafter changed her will to leave the man $1,000. However,
upon the wife's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the
entirety of the husband. The property had been purchased by the husband from an inheritance. 

After the wife died, the husband signed and delivered to the man the following instrument: "In consideration of
[the man]'s saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I
hereby promise to pay [the man] $1,000." 

Upon the husband's death, the man filed a claim for $1,000. The husband's executor contested the claim on
the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration. 

With respect to the recital that the man had agreed not to file a claim against the husband's estate, what
additional fact would most strengthen the man's claim? 

A: The man's agreement was made in a writing he signed.
B: The man reasonably believed he had a valid claim when the instrument was signed.
C: The wife had contributed to accumulation of the real property.
D: The man paid the husband $1 when he received the instrument.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. A promise to surrender a legal claim is sufficient consideration to support a return promise
even if the claim turns out to be invalid, so long as the person surrendering the claim has a good faith belief in
its validity. As long as the man genuinely believed that he had a valid claim against the husband, his promise
to relinquish such claim provides sufficient consideration to support the husband's promise to pay the man
$1,000.  

A is incorrect because a writing would not excuse an absence of consideration. C is incorrect because the
tenancy in the entirety would preclude her devise to the man. D is incorrect because some courts will find that
the payment of nominal consideration in exchange for a promise is a "mere pretense" of a bargain and is not
enforceable.

Question 349 - Contracts - Impracticability and Frustration of Purpose

 The question was: 

On January 15, a carpenter agreed to repair a homeowner's house according to certain specifications and to
have the work completed by April 1. On March 1, the homeowner's property was inundated by flood waters
which did not abate until March 15. The homeowner could not get the house in a condition which would permit
the carpenter to begin the repairs until March 31. On that date the carpenter notified the homeowner that he
would not repair the house. 

Which one of the following facts, if it was the only one true and known to both parties on January 15, would
best serve the carpenter as the basis for a defense in an action brought against him by the homeowner for
breach of contract? 

A: The carpenter's busy schedule permitted him to work on the homeowner's house only during the month of
March.
B: Any delay in making the repairs would not seriously affect the homeowner's use of the property.
C: The cost of making repairs was increasing at the rate of 3 percent a month.
D: The area around the homeowner's property was frequently flooded during the month of March.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. A party's performance under a contract may be excused on grounds of supervening
impracticability where the performance is made impracticable without his fault due to the occurrence of an
event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. If the delay
resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties'
remaining obligations under the contract. Since the flood was an act of God that related to a basic assumption
of the agreement to repair the homeowner's house, it operated to excuse any resulting delay in completing the
requested work. Whether or not the delay was sufficiently severe to discharge the parties' remaining
obligations under the contract depends on whether circumstances have so changed that performance will
become materially more burdensome than the agreed-upon performance. The carpenter's busy schedule after
March suggests that continued performance after the delay would be materially burdensome and thus his
obligation should be completely discharged. 

B and D are incorrect because neither fact is relevant to whether the carpenter is justified in refusing to
continue performance as of March 31. C is incorrect because this factor alone would not make continued
performance by the carpenter materially more burdensome.

Question 350 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

In a telephone call on March 1, an unemployed retired man said to a purchaser, "I will sell my automobile for
$3,000 cash. I will hold this offer open through March 14." On March 12, the man called the purchaser and told
her that he had sold the automobile to a friend. The man in fact had not sold the automobile to anyone. On
March 14, the purchaser learned that the man still owned the automobile and on that date called the man and
said, "I'm coming over to your place with $3,000." The man replied, "Don't bother, I won't deliver the
automobile to you under any circumstances." The purchaser protested, but made no further attempt to pay for
or take delivery of the automobile. 

In an action by the purchaser against the man for breach of contract, the purchaser probably will 

A: succeed, because the man had assured her that the offer would remain open through March 14.
B: succeed, because the man had not in fact sold the automobile to the friend.
C: not succeed, because the purchaser had not tendered the $3,000 to the man on or before March 14.
D: not succeed, because on March 12 the man had told the purchaser that he had sold the automobile to the
friend.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Unless an option contract is created, the offeror retains the power to revoke an offer at
any time prior to acceptance. In order to create an option, the offeror must manifest an intent not to revoke the
offer during the time stated, and the option promise must be supported by consideration. The promise that the
man made to the purchaser on March 1 was not an option promise because it was not supported by
consideration. Furthermore, the offer is not preserved by the UCC's firm offer rule because the man was not a
merchant and the offer was not a signed writing. Therefore, the man's March 12 statement that the car had
been sold was effective as a revocation, even though untrue, because it manifested the man's intention not to
enter into the contract, and the revocation was made prior to the purchaser's attempted acceptance. 

A is incorrect because the man's assurance that the offer would remain open is not sufficient to limit his right to
revoke. B is incorrect because what matters for the revocation to be effective is that it must manifest an intent
not to enter into the contract. C is incorrect because this offer was for a bilateral contract, which could have
been accepted by the purchaser's promise to pay. Actual payment by March 14th was not a condition of the
contract.

Question 371 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

In a written contract a seller agreed to deliver to a buyer 500 described chairs at $20 each F.O.B. seller's place
of business. The contract provided that "neither party will assign this contract without the written consent of the
other." The seller placed the chairs on board a carrier on January 30. On February 1 the seller said in a signed
writing, "I hereby assign to my friend all my rights under the seller-buyer contract." The seller did not request
and did not get the buyer's consent to this transaction. On February 2 the chairs while in transit were destroyed
in a derailment of the carrier's railroad car. 

In an action by the friend against the buyer, the friend probably will recover 

A: $10,000, the contract price.
B: the difference between the contract price and the market value of the chairs.
C: nothing, because the chairs had not been delivered.
D: nothing, because the seller-buyer contract forbade an assignment.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Although the contract required consent for assignment and the buyer has the right to
damages for breach of this prohibition, the assignment of payment rights to the friend is effective. Assignment
of contractual rights, such as the right to be paid, are effective even if the contract prohibits it, unless the
clause makes assignments "void" or the assignee had notice, neither of which is present here. Thus, D is
incorrect. B is incorrect because the chairs were destroyed and their market value would be zero; thus, the
expectation interest is the contract price. C is incorrect because, under the UCC, the risk of loss passed to the
buyer when the goods were delivered by the seller to the carrier.

Question 376 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

After several days of negotiations, an office building owner wrote to a plumber: "Will pay you $3,000 if you will
install new plumbing in my office building according to the specifications I have sent you. I must have your
reply by March 30." The plumber replied by a letter that the owner received on March 15: "Will not do it for less
than $3,500." On March 20, the plumber wrote to the owner: "Have changed my mind. I will do the work for
$3,000. Unless I hear from you to the contrary, I will begin work on April 5." The owner received this letter on
March 22 but did not reply to it. The plumber, without the owner's knowledge, began the work on April 5. 

Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between the owner and the plumber as of April
5? 

A: A contract was formed on March 20 when the plumber posted his letter.
B: A contract was formed on March 22 when the owner received the plumber's letter.
C: A contract was formed on April 5 when the plumber began work.
D: There was no contract between the parties as of April 5.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The plumber's rejection of the owner's offer on the 15th ended that negotiation, and the
letter sent on the 20th was a new, separate, and distinct offer. There was no contract because silence could
only operate as an acceptance in this case if the owner wished or intended to be bound by his silence. The
plumber bears the risk of uncertainty in phrasing his offer in this manner; the purpose underlying this rule of
law is to protect the offeree from imposition. Thus, the owner's silence will operate as acceptance only if he
intends for his silence to manifest acceptance. Because he is unaware of the plumber's performance, there are
no facts to support his intent to accept the offer made by the plumber on March 20. 

A and B are incorrect because the plumber's March 20 letter containing a different price term operated as a
counter offer, which required acceptance by the owner to create an enforceable contract. C is incorrect
because the plumber made a counter offer which only the owner could accept.

Question 377 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

On January 15, in a signed writing, an artist agreed to remodel a building owner's building according to certain
specifications, and the owner to pay the agreed price of $5,000 to the artist's niece as a birthday present. The
niece did not learn of the agreement until her birthday on May 5. 

Before they signed the writing, the artist and the owner had orally agreed that their "written agreement will be
null and void unless the owner is able to obtain a $5,000 loan from the bank before January 31." 

The owner was unable to obtain the loan, and, on January 31, phoned the artist and told him, "Don't begin the
work. The deal is off." In an action for breach of contract brought against the owner by the proper party, will the
owner be successful in asserting as a defense his inability to obtain a loan? 

A: Yes, because obtaining a loan was a condition precedent to the existence of an enforceable contract.
B: Yes, because the agreement about obtaining a loan is a modification of a construction contract and is not
required to be in writing.
C: No. because the agreement about obtaining a loan contradicts the express and implied terms of the writing.
D: No, because the owner is estopped to deny the validity of the written agreement.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Although the agreement is oral, it can be admitted to clarify the written agreement. The
language of this oral agreement is an express condition precedent to enforcement and express conditions are
strictly construed. 

B is incorrect. Because the oral agreement was made before the written agreement was signed, it technically
was not a modification. If, however, it were construed as such, then although modifications of land contracts
are not exempt from the writing requirement, the written agreement may satisfy the Statute of Frauds for the
oral agreement here. C is incorrect because the written agreement is silent as to the effect of not obtaining the
loan or the date upon which performance was to begin. There is also nothing implied into the agreement that
would contradict the oral condition. D is also incorrect because the artist had not begun performance prior to
the January 31 notice that the loan had not been obtained, and there are no other facts to support detrimental
reliance upon the written agreement by the artist. Thus, there is no estoppel.

Question 378 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

On January 15, in a signed writing, an artist agreed to remodel a building owner's building according to certain
specifications, and the owner to pay the agreed price of $5,000 to the artist's niece as a birthday present. The
niece did not learn of the agreement until her birthday on May 5. 

Before they signed the writing, the artist and the owner had orally agreed that their "written agreement will be
null and void unless the owner is able to obtain a $5,000 loan from the bank before January 31." 

The owner obtained the loan, the artist completed the remodeling on May 1, and on May 3, at the artist's
request, the owner paid the $5,000 to the artist. If the niece learns of the owner's payment to the artist on May
5 at the same time she learns of the written artist-owner contract, will she succeed in action against the owner
for $5,000? 

A: Yes, because she is an intended beneficiary of the written artist-owner contract.
B: Yes, because the written artist-owner contract operated as an assignment to the niece, and the artist
thereby lost whatever rights he may have had to the $5,000.
C: No, because the niece had not furnished any consideration to support the owner's promise to pay $5,000 to
her.
D: No, because on May 3, the artist and the owner effectively modified their written contract, thereby depriving
the niece of whatever right she may have had under that contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Prior to the modification, the niece had no knowledge and thus no reliance on her status
as a third-party beneficiary under the contract. As such, her rights had not vested. For these reasons A is
incorrect. B is incorrect because payment to the niece was set forth in the original agreement as a gift. An
assignment, on the other hand, involves the transfer of rights under an existing contract. C is also incorrect
because an intended beneficiary, even if gratuitous, need not supply consideration in order to enforce a right to
recovery. All that is necessary is that the right vest.

Question 386 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

When a woman's 21-year-old daughter finished college, the woman handed her a signed memorandum stating
that if she would go to law school for three academic years, she would pay her tuition, room, and board and
would "give her a $1,000 bonus" for each "A" she got in law school. The daughter's uncle, who was present on
this occasion, read the memorandum and thereupon said to the daughter, "and if she doesn't pay your
expenses, I will." The woman paid her tuition, room, and board for her first year but died just before the end of
that year. Subsequently, the daughter learned that she had received two "A's" in the second semester. The
executor of the woman's estate has refused to pay her anything for the two "A's" and has told her that the
estate will no longer pay her tuition, room, and board in law school. 

In an action by the daughter against the uncle on account of the executor's repudiation of the woman's
promise to pay future tuition, room, and board, which of the following would be the uncle's strongest defense? 

A: The parties did not manifestly intend a contract.
B: The woman's death terminated the agreement.
C: The agreement was oral.
D: The agreement was divisible.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Under the Statute of Frauds, promises made to answer for the debt of another generally
fall within the suretyship clause of the statute and therefore must meet the writing and signing requirements of
the statute. The uncle's promise to the daughter falls within the suretyship provision of the statute, since it is a
promise by the uncle to the daughter to answer for the debt of the woman. Because the promise was oral, it
did not meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute and therefore is not enforceable. 

A is incorrect because the parties' statements do manifest an intent to contract. B is incorrect because,
although the woman's death cut off the daughter's power to accept the woman's offer, it does not affect the
enforceability of the uncle's promise. D is incorrect because divisibility is not relevant to the enforceability of
the uncle's promise.

Question 394 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

On March 31, a seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement in which the seller agreed to fabricate and
sell to the buyer 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by the
buyer. The contract provided that the buyer would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give the
seller funds to "tool up" for the work; that the seller would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that the buyer
would pay the balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that the seller would deliver the balance of the
brake linings on June 30. 

On May 10, the seller notified the buyer that it was doubtful whether the seller could perform because of
problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15, however,
the seller assured the buyer that the production difficulties had been overcome, and the buyer paid the seller
the first 50 percent installment of the purchase price. The seller did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on
May 31, or at any time thereafter; and on June 10, the seller notified that it would not perform the contract. 

Which of the following correctly states the buyer's rights and obligations immediately after receipt of the seller's
notice on May 10? 

A: The buyer can treat the notice as an anticipatory repudiation, and has cause of action on May 10 for breach
of the entire contract.
B: The buyer can treat the notice as an anticipatory repudiation, and can sue to enjoin an actual breach by the
seller on May 31.
C: The buyer has no cause of action for breach of contract, but can suspend its performance and demand
assurances that the seller will perform.
D: The buyer has no cause of action for breach of contract, and must pay the installment of the purchase price
due on May 15 to preserve its rights under the contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Under the UCC, repudiation of a contractual obligation may be treated as a total breach of
that obligation. In order to amount to repudiation, however, the statement must be unequivocal; a statement
that merely expresses doubt over a party's ability or willingness to perform is not sufficient. When reasonable
grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the other party's performance, the other may make a written
demand for adequate assurances of performance and suspend return performance if commercially
reasonable. Failure to respond to a justified demand for assurances is a repudiation of the contract. At the time
of the buyer's receipt of the seller's notice on May 10, the seller had not repudiated the contract, as the notice
only expressed doubt over whether performance was possible. The notice did, however, provide reasonable
grounds for the buyer to demand adequate assurances of performance and to suspend its return
performance. 

A and B are incorrect because the May 10 notice was not an unequivocal expression of unwillingness or
inability to perform. D is incorrect because the May 10 notice gave the buyer reasonable grounds for
insecurity, and therefore the buyer would be justified in suspending the May 15 payment until such assurances
are given.

Question 395 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

On March 31, a seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement in which the seller agreed to fabricate and
sell to the buyer 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by the
buyer. The contract provided that the buyer would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give the
seller funds to "tool up" for the work; that the seller would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that the buyer
would pay the balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that the seller would deliver the balance of the
brake linings on June 30. 

On May 10, the seller notified the buyer that it was doubtful whether the seller could perform because of
problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15, however,
the seller assured the buyer that the production difficulties had been overcome, and the buyer paid the seller
the first 50 percent installment of the purchase price. The seller did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on
May 31, or at any time thereafter; and on June 10, the seller notified that it would not perform the contract. 

Which of the following is NOT a correct statement of the parties' legal status immediately after the seller's
notice on June 10? 

A: The buyer has a cause of action for total breach of contract because of the seller's repudiation, but that
cause of action will be lost if the seller retracts its repudiation before the buyer changes its position or
manifests to the seller that the buyer considers the repudiation final.
B: The buyer can bring suit to rescind the contract even if it elects to await the seller's performance for a
commercially reasonable time.
C: The buyer can await performance by the seller for a commercially reasonable time, but if the buyer awaits
performance beyond that period, it cannot recover any resulting damages that it reasonably could have
avoided.
D: The buyer has a cause of action for breach of contract that it can successfully assert only after it has given
the seller a commercially reasonable time to perform.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Under the UCC, when either party repudiates a contract for the sale of goods with respect
to a performance whose loss will substantially affect the value of the contract, the non-repudiating party may
await performance for a commercially reasonable time or immediately resort to remedies for breach of
contract. The non-repudiating party, however, may not recover damages that he might have mitigated with
reasonable effort. The repudiating party is still free to retract its repudiation unless the non-repudiating party
has relied on it or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final. The seller's June 10 statement
that it would not perform the contract, when read in light of its earlier communications and failure to make a
delivery when due, amounts to a repudiation that gives the buyer the right to bring immediate action for
breach. Therefore, D is the correct answer choice because the buyer does not need to give the seller a
commercially reasonable time to perform. A, B, and C are incorrect as each of the statements are accurate.

Question 401 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation

 The question was: 

A corporation, through its president, requested from a financing company a short-term loan of $100,000. On
April 1, the corporation's president and the financing company's loan officer agreed orally that the financing
company would make the loan on the following terms: (1) The loan would be repaid in full on or before the
following July 1 and would carry interest at an annual rate of 15 percent (a lawful rate under the applicable
usury law), and (2) the corporation's president would personally guarantee repayment. The loan was approved
and made on April 5. The only document evidencing the loan was a memorandum, written and supplied by the
financing company and signed by the president for the corporation, that read in its entirety: "April 5 

In consideration of a loan advanced on this date, the corporation hereby promises to pay the financing
company, $100,000 on September 1. 

The corporation 

By /s/ the president" The corporation did not repay the loan on or before July 1, although it had sufficient funds
to do so. On July 10, the financing company sued the corporation as principal debtor and the corporation's
president individually as guarantor for $100,000, plus 15 percent interest from April 5. 

At the trial, can the financing company prove the corporation's oral commitment to repay the loan on or before
July 1? 

A: Yes, because the oral agreement was supported by an independent consideration.
B: Yes, because the evidence of the parties' negotiations is relevant to their contractual intent concerning
maturity of the debt.
C: No, because such evidence is barred by the preexisting duty rule.
D: No, because such evidence contradicts the writing and is barred by the parol evidence rule.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the
prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to
add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and
exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). The oral commitment that the financing company seeks
to introduce (that the loan would be repaid "on or before July 1") contradicts the final writing executed between
the parties (stating that the corporation promises to repay the loan "on September 1"). Therefore, it is barred
by the parol evidence rule. 

A is incorrect because the collateral agreement exception to the parol evidence rule would not apply where the
extrinsic evidence is in direct conflict with the writing. B is incorrect because evidence of the parties'
negotiations is precisely the type of evidence that the parol evidence rule excludes. C is incorrect because the
promise is inadmissible under the parol evidence rule regardless of whether it was supported by consideration.

Question 402 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

A corporation, through its president, requested from a financing company a short-term loan of $100,000. On
April 1, the corporation's president and the financing company's loan officer agreed orally that the financing
company would make the loan on the following terms: (1) The loan would be repaid in full on or before the
following July 1 and would carry interest at an annual rate of 15 percent (a lawful rate under the applicable
usury law), and (2) the corporation's president would personally guarantee repayment. The loan was approved
and made on April 5. The only document evidencing the loan was a memorandum, written and supplied by the
financing company and signed by the president of the corporation, that read in its entirety: "April 5 

In consideration of a loan advanced on this date, the corporation hereby promises to pay the financing
company, $100,000 on September 1. 

The corporation 

By /s/ the president" The corporation did not repay the loan on or before July 1, although it had sufficient funds
to do so. On July 10, the financing company sued the corporation as principal debtor and the corporation's
president individually as guarantor for $100,000, plus 15 percent interest from April 5. 

At the trial, can the financing company prove the president's oral promise to guarantee the loan? 

A: Yes, because the president signed the memorandum.
B: Yes, because, as president of the debtor company, the president is a third-party beneficiary of the loan.
C: No, because there was no separate consideration for the president's promise.
D: No, because such proof is barred by the statute of frauds.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The Statute of Frauds requires that agreements to act as a surety or to guarantee the
debt of another, when there has not been a novation, are within the statute and require a writing. 

A is incorrect because the written memorandum does not mention the president's oral promise to guarantee
the corporation's debt. B is incorrect because the contract was not made to benefit the president or create
enforcement rights in him. C is incorrect because the president's personal guarantee may have been
necessary to obtain the loan, and because the two agreements were made simultaneously, separate
consideration may not be required.

Question 410 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A landowner owned Broadacres in fee simple. For a consideration of $5,000, the landowner gave his neighbor
a written option to purchase Broadacres for $300,000. The option was assignable. For a consideration of
$10,000, the neighbor subsequently gave an option to his friend to purchase Broadacres for $325,000. The
friend exercised his option. 

The neighbor thereupon exercised his option. The neighbor paid the agreed price of $300,000 and took title to
Broadacres by deed from the landowner. Thereafter, the friend refused to consummate his purchase. 

The neighbor brought an appropriate action against the friend for specific performance, or, if that should be
denied, then for damages. The friend counterclaimed for return of the $10,000. In this action the court will 

A: grant money damages only to the neighbor.
B: grant specific performance to the neighbor.
C: grant the neighbor only the right to retain the $10,000.
D: require the neighbor to refund the $10,000 to the friend.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. An option promise is a promise not to revoke an offer to enter into a contract, and it
requires separate consideration to be enforceable. When a party exercises an option, that party in effect
accepts the offer and binds himself to the contract. The friend paid the neighbor $10,000 in exchange for the
neighbor's promise not to revoke his offer to sell. When the friend exercised the option, he became obligated to
purchase Broadacres for $325,000, and his failure to consummate his purchase entitled the neighbor to
pursue remedies for breach of contract. Specific performance generally will be awarded for breach of contract
where an award of monetary damages would be inadequate or impracticable. Contracts involving the sale of
land historically have been regarded as unique, and therefore equitable relief traditionally has been allowed,
even where the breaching party is the buyer. Because the obligation that the neighbor seeks to enforce is the
friend's obligation to purchase Broadacres (a contract to purchase land), specific performance will be
awarded. 

A is incorrect because the contract involves the sale of land, and therefore the neighbor will be awarded
specific performance. C is incorrect because the neighbor not only is entitled to retain the option price, but he
is also entitled to a remedy for the friend's breach. D is incorrect because the friend paid the $10,000 in
exchange for the option. Even if the friend failed to exercise the option, he cannot seek return of the purchase
price once the option has been given to him.

Question 420 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties

 The question was: 

A written contract was entered into between a financier-investor and a winery. The contract provided that the
financier-investor would invest $1,000,000 in the winery for its capital expansion and, in return, that the winery,
from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each
year for five years under a label with the financier's name on it. 

The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture
and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by the winery only through a wholesale distributor of fine
wines. Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The
wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance
thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine
storage and display facility. 

A bank lent the financier-investor $200,000 and the financier-investor executed a written instrument providing
that the bank "is entitled to collect the debt from my share of the profits, if any, under the the winery-investor
contract." The bank gave prompt notice of this transaction to the winery. 

If the winery thereafter refused to account for any profits to the bank, and the bank sues the winery for the
financier-investor's share of profits then realized, the winery's strongest argument in defense is that 

A: the investor-winery contract did not expressly authorize an assignment of rights.
B: the financier-investor and the winery are partners, not simply debtor and creditor.
C: the bank is not an assignee of the financier-investor's rights under the investor-winery contract.
D: the bank is not an intended third-party beneficiary of the investor-winery contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. The language of the financier-investor's promise may not be sufficient to assign its rights
of payment from its contract with the winery. The language simply says the bank can collect to satisfy the
financier-investor's debt to the bank "from my share of the profits." A is incorrect because contract rights are
freely assignable. B is incorrect because if the agreement between the financier-investor and the winery were
found to be a partnership agreement, partnership interests are assignable. D is incorrect because the bank
need not qualify as a beneficiary under the first contract to acquire the financier-investor's right to profits under
that agreement.

Question 421 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A written contract was entered into between a financier-investor and a winery. The contract provided that the
financier-investor would invest $1,000,000 in the winery for its capital expansion and, in return, that the winery,
from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each
year for five years under a label with the financier's name on it. 

The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture
and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by the winery only through a wholesale distributor of fine
wines. Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The
wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance
thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine
storage and display facility. 

Soon after making its contract with the the financier-investor, the winery, without the the financier-investor's
knowledge or assent, sold its vineyards but not its winery to a large agricultural corporation. Under the terms of
this sale, the agricultural corporation agreed to sell to the winery all grapes grown on the land for five years.
The agricultural corporation's employees have no experience in winegrape production, and the agricultural
corporation has no reputation in the wine industry as a grape producer or otherwise. The investor-winery
contract was silent on the matter of the winery selling any or all of its business assets. 

If the financier-investor seeks an appropriate judicial remedy against the winery for entering into the
winery-agricultural corporation transaction, is the financier-investor likely to prevail?  

A: Yes, because the winery-agricultural corporation transaction created a significant risk of diminishing the
profits in which the financier-investor would share under his contract with the winery.
B: Yes, because the investor-winery contract did not contain a provision authorizing a delegation of the
winery's duties.
C: No, because the winery remains in a position to perform under the investor-winery contract.
D: No, because the winery, as a corporation, must necessarily perform its contracts by delegating duties to
individuals.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The financier-investor relied upon the fact that the winery was famous for its vineyards
when the financier-investor entered into the five-year agreement with the winery. The winery was thus not free
to delegate its duty of grape production to an inexperienced buyer, because this act of delegation would impair
the financier-investor's reasonable expectations under the agreement. 

B is incorrect because delegation is permitted unless a contract specifically prohibits delegation, or the nature
of the contract is such that the transfer would impair the other party's reasonable expectations. C is incorrect
because the winery's performance will now be directly based upon the agricultural corporation's output, and
given the agricultural corporation's lack of experience with winegrape production, the winery has created a
significant risk regarding performance. D is incorrect because although corporations require individuals to
perform duties, when they do so, they are not delegating contractual duties. The individual is acting on behalf
of the corporation. The winery was experienced in the field, as were its employees. When the winery
subsequently entered into an agreement with the agricultural corporation, it delegated its duty of grape
production to an inexperienced buyer.

Question 431 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

On June 1, a manufacturer of men's neckties received the following order from a retailer: "Ship 500 two-inch
ties, assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34. Delivery by July 1." 

On June 1, the manufacturer shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at the retailer's place of business on June
3. The retailer immediately telegraphed the manufacturer: "Reject your shipment. Order was for two-inch ties."
The retailer, however, did not ship the ties back to the manufacturer. The manufacturer replied by telegram:
"Will deliver proper ties before July 1." The retailer received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it. 

On June 30, the manufacturer tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as
item No. V34, but the retailer refused to accept them. 

Did the retailer properly reject the ties delivered on June 3? 

A: Yes, because the ties were nonconforming goods.
B: Yes, because the manufacturer did not notify the retailer that the ties were shipped as an accommodation
to the retailer.
C: No, because the manufacturer could accept the retailer's offer by prompt shipment of either conforming or
nonconforming goods.
D: No, because the retailer waived his right to reject the ties by not returning them promptly to the
manufacturer.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The retailer satisfied its duty to promptly notify the manufacturer that the goods were
rejected as nonconforming. 

B and C are incorrect because pursuant to UCC 2-206, a seller accepts whether it ships conforming or
nonconforming goods. If the seller's shipment, however, is accompanied by notice that the goods are
nonconforming and are offered as an accommodation, the seller has not accepted but has made a counter
offer, which the retailer could have accepted or rejected. The manufacturer's shipment without notice
constituted an attempted acceptance and simultaneously a breach of contract. The retailer was entitled to
perfect tender of the goods under UCC 2-601 and was free to reject goods that failed "in any respect to
conform to the contract." 

D is incorrect because the retailer did not waive his rights upon rejection and retention of the goods. He was
under a duty to notify the seller and to hold the goods "with reasonable care at the seller's disposition for a
time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them." UCC 2-602(2)(b).

On June 1, the manufacturer shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at the retailer's place of business on June

The retailer, however, did not ship the ties back to the manufacturer. The manufacturer replied by telegram:

On June 30, the manufacturer tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as
item No. V34, but the retailer refused to accept them. 

Did the retailer properly reject the ties tendered on June 30? 

A: Yes, because the manufacturer's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was a present breach of contract.
B: Yes, because the manufacturer's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was an anticipatory repudiation.
C: No, because the manufacturer cured the June 1 defective delivery by his tender of conforming goods on
June 30.
D: No, because a contract for sale of goods can be modified without consideration.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. When the retailer rejected the ties, the agreed time for performance (July 1) had not
expired. Thus, the manufacturer, who had performed in good faith and who notified the retailer of an intent to
cure by shipping conforming ties, could do so as long as the conforming delivery was made within the agreed
time. UCC 2-508(1). A is incorrect because although the shipment on June 1 was a breach of contract, the
manufacturer preserved the right to cure before July 1. B is incorrect because anticipatory repudiation consists
of an indication by the seller through words or conduct that to contract would not be completed. Here, the
manufacturer did the opposite and assured the retailer that the proper ties would be delivered before July 1. D
is incorrect because the contract was not modified; 500 two-inch ties were delivered by July 1.

Question 442 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

A wealthy widow, wishing to make a substantial and potentially enduring gift to her beloved adult stepson,
established with a bank a passbook savings account by an initial deposit of $10,000. 

The passbook was issued solely in the stepson's name, but the widow retained possession of it, and the
stepson was not then informed of the savings account. Subsequently, the widow became disgusted with the
stepson's behavior and decided to give the same savings account solely to her beloved adult daughter. As
permitted by the rules of the bank, the widow effected this change by agreement with the bank. This time she
left possession of the passbook with the bank. Shortly thereafter, the stepson learned of the original savings
account in his name and the subsequent switch to the widow's daughter's name. 

If the stepson now sues the bank for $10,000 plus accrued interest, will the action succeed? 

A: Yes, because the stepson was a third-party intended beneficiary of the original widow-bank deposit
agreement.
B: Yes, because the stepson was a constructive assignee of the widow's claim, as depositor, to the savings
account.
C: No, because the stepson never obtained possession of the passbook.
D: No, because the stepson's right, if any, to the funds on deposit was effectively abrogated by the second
widow-bank deposit agreement.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. To the extent that the stepson was a third-party beneficiary of the deposit agreement, his
rights were abrogated before they vested because he neither knew about nor relied upon the existence of the
deposit account prior to abrogation. For this reason A is incorrect. B is incorrect because the widow did not
assign her rights under another agreement to her stepson when she established the first deposit agreement. C
is incorrect because the stepson's possession of the passbook was not necessary for the right to vest. His
possession would constitute performance of the duty to him under the contract after the right had vested.

Question 443 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties

 The question was: 

A wealthy widow, wishing to make a substantial and potentially enduring gift to her beloved adult stepson,
established with a bank a passbook savings account by an initial deposit of $10,000. 

The passbook was issued by the bank to the widow solely in her own name. That same day, disinterested
witnesses being present, she handed the passbook to her stepson and said, "As a token of my love and
affection for you, I give you this $10,000 savings account." Shortly thereafter, she changed her mind and wrote
her stepson, "I hereby revoke my gift to you of the $10,000 savings account with the bank. Please return my
passbook immediately," and signed her name. The stepson received the letter but ignored it, and the widow
died unexpectedly a few days later. 

In litigation between the stepson and the widow's estate, which of the following is a correct statement of the
parties' rights with respect to the money on deposit with the bank? 

A: The estate prevails, because the widow's gift to the stepson was revocable and was terminated by her
death.
B: The estate prevails, because the widow's gift to the stepson was revocable and was terminated by her
express revocation.
C: The stepson prevails, because he took the widow's claim to the savings account by a gratuitous but
effective and irrevocable assignment from the widow.
D: The stepson prevails, because his failure to reject the gift, even if the assignment was revocable, created
an estoppel against the widow and her estate.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. The widow orally manifested her intent to gratuitously assign her rights in the passbook
savings account directly to her stepson. The stepson's acceptance is implied by his silence. A and B are
incorrect because only promises to make future gifts are revocable. Completed gifts are not revocable, and
this gift was effective immediately upon valid delivery of the passbook because a passbook is representative of
the money in the account. D is incorrect because an estoppel is not created where there is a completed
inter-vivos gift.

Question 446 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

A buyer purchased a used car from a used car dealer. Knowing them to be false, the dealer made the
following statements to the buyer prior to the sale: 

This car has never been involved in an accident. 

This car gets 25 miles to the gallon on the open highway. 

This is as smooth-riding a car as you can get. 

If the buyer asserts a claim against the dealer based on deceit, which of the false statements made by the
dealer would support the buyer's claim? 

A: Only the statement that the car has never been involved in an accident.
B: Only the statement that the car gets 25 miles to the gallon on the open highway.
C: The statements that the car has never been involved in an accident and gets 25 miles to the gallon on the
open highway.
D: The statements that the car gets 25 miles to the gallon on the open highway and is as smooth-riding a car
as you can get.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. The dealer's statements, that the car has never been involved in an accident and that the
car gets 25 miles to the gallon on the open highway, both involve false representations of fact about the car.
The dealer knew these representations of fact to be false, but still made them with the intent to induce the
buyer to enter into the contract even though they would cause injury to the buyer. Finally, the false statements
were made by someone with superior knowledge about the car and related to its value and ascertainable facts
about the car. For these reasons, A and B are incorrect. D is incorrect because the dealer's statement that the
car is as smooth-riding a car as you can get is either an opinion that is open to question or, more likely, a
statement of "puffery" upon which the buyer should not have relied.

Question 459 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

On October 1, a toy store entered into a written contract with a toy factory for the purchase at $20 per unit of
1,000 mechanical dogs to be specially manufactured by the factory according to the store's specifications. The
factory promised to deliver all of the dogs "not later than November 15, for the Yule shopping season," and the
store promised to pay the full $20,000 price upon delivery. In order to obtain operating funds, the factory as
borrower entered into a written loan agreement on October 5 with a finance company. In relevant part, this
agreement recited, "[the factory] hereby transfers and assigns to [the finance company] its [the factory's]
October 1 mechanical dog contract with the store, as security for a 50-day loan of $15,000, the advance and
receipt of which are hereby acknowledged by [the factory]. . ." No copy of this agreement, or statement relating
to it, was filed in an office of public record. 

On October 15, the factory notified the store, "We regret to advise that our master shaft burned out last night
because our night supervisor let the lubricant level get too low. We have just fired the supervisor, but the shaft
cannot be repaired or replaced until about January 1. We can guarantee delivery of your order, however, not
later than January 20." The store rejected this proposal as unacceptable and immediately contracted with the
only other available manufacturer to obtain the 1,000 dogs at $30 per unit by November 15. 

On November 1, the store sues the factory for damages and alleges the above facts, except those relating to
the factory-finance loan agreement. Upon the factory's motion to dismiss the complaint, the court should 

A: sustain the motion, because the factory on October 15 stated its willingness, and gave assurance of its
ability, to perform the contract in January.
B: sustain the motion, because the store's lawsuit is premature in any case until after November 15.
C: deny the motion, because the store's complaint alleges an actionable tort by the factory.
D: deny the motion, because the store's complaint alleges an actionable breach of contract by the factory.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Because the contract specified that the goods were to be delivered "not later than
November 15, for the Yule shopping season," time was of the essence and was an express condition requiring
strict compliance by the factory. The factory's failure to meet this condition gave the store the right to terminate
their contract and to claim damages for the factory's breach. 

A is incorrect because performance by January 20 could not cure the breach given the fact that the factory
knew the toys were necessary for the holiday season, which would have ended by January 20. B is incorrect
because the factory's October 15 letter constituted an anticipatory repudiation - advance notice of its intent to
breach when the time for performance arrived - or breach in advance of the date for performance. Although it
appears that the the factory employee was negligent, the store has a valid breach of contract claim against the
factory.

Question 464 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

In March, when a teenager was 17, an electronics dealer delivered to the teenager a television set. At that time
the teenager agreed in writing to pay $400 for the set on July 1 when he would reach his eighteenth birthday.
Eighteen is the applicable statutory age of majority, and on that date the teenager was to receive the proceeds
of a trust. On July 1, when the reasonable value of the television set was $250, the teenager sent the dealer a
signed letter stating, "I'll only pay you $300; that is all the set is worth." 

In an action against the teenager for money damages on July 2, what is the maximum amount that the dealer
will be entitled to recover? 

A: Nothing
B: $250, the reasonable value of the set
C: $300, the amount the teenager promised to pay in his letter of July 1
D: $400, the original sale price

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Because the promises were exchanged when the teenager was a minor, he had voidable
rights under the contract. His July 1 letter was written upon his eighteenth birthday, and because agreements
cannot be partially disaffirmed, this letter amounted to a disaffirmance of the prior agreement. Thus, the only
amount the dealer can receive is the amount now offered by the teenager. 

A is incorrect because although the teenager was entitled to disaffirm the contract upon reaching majority, he
was also entitled to ratify his earlier agreement, which he did by agreeing to pay a reduced amount. B is
incorrect because the teenager had the right to disaffirm the contract and to obtain rescission by returning the
consideration (the television set) and if he did this, he would not incur any additional obligation. He would not
be obligated to pay its reasonable value. D is incorrect, because the teenager acquired only voidable duties
under the original contract.

Question 478 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

The inventor of the LBVC, a laser-beam vegetable chopper, ran a television ad that described the chopper and
said, "The LBVC is yours for only $49.99 if you send your check or money order to Box 007, Greenville. Not
available in stores." The owner of a retail specialty shop, wrote the inventor, "What's your best, firm price for
two dozen LBVC's." The inventor sent a written reply that said in its entirety, "We quote you for prompt
acceptance $39.99 per unit for 24 LBVC's." The owner of the retail specialty shop subsequently mailed a
check to the inventor in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, "I accept your offer for 24
LBVC's." 

A contract would arise from these communications only if 

A: both parties were merchants.
B: the inventor had at least 24 LBVC's in stock when the owner of the retail specialty shop's check and memo
were received.
C: the owner of the retail specialty shop's check and memo were mailed within three months after his receipt of
the inventor's letter.
D: the owner of the retail specialty shop's check and memo were mailed within a reasonable time after his
receipt of the inventor's letters.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The inventor's letter to the owner of the retail specialty shop, when taken in conjunction
with the surrounding circumstances - the television advertisement - constituted an offer to the owner, which the
owner could accept by complying with the television advertisement's method of acceptance. Since no duration
was stated in either the advertisement or the letter to the owner, the offer would lapse after a reasonable time
under the circumstances. 

Choice A is incorrect because merchant status does not govern all transactions involving the sale of goods
and is not necessary under the UCC for the owner to accept an offer for the sale of goods. Merchant status is
only relevant in limited instances under the UCC, such as firm offers and the Statute of Frauds. Choice B is
incorrect because the inventor's letter to the owner offered to provide 24 LBVC's. Choice C is incorrect
because a reasonable period governs an offeree's power of acceptance. The three-month limitation for firm
offers under the UCC does not apply because the offer gave no assurance that it would be held open and in
fact used language indicating the contrary - "for prompt acceptance."

Question 479 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

The inventor of the LBVC, a laser-beam vegetable chopper, ran a television ad that described the chopper and
said, "The LBVC is yours for only $49.99 if you send your check or money order to Box 007, Greenville. Not
available in stores." The owner of a retail specialty shop, wrote the inventor, "What's your best, firm price for
two dozen LBVC's." The inventor sent a written reply that said in its entirety, "We quote you for prompt
acceptance $39.99 per unit for 24 LBVC's." The owner of the retail specialty shop subsequently mailed a
check to the inventor in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, "I accept your offer for 24
LBVC's." 

The inventor shipped 24 LBVC's to the owner of the retail specialty shop after receiving his check and memo,
and with the shipment sent the owner of the retail specialty shop an invoice that conspicuously stated, among
other things, the following lawful provision: "These items shall not be offered for resale at retail." The owner of
the retail specialty shop received and read but disregarded the invoice restriction and displayed the 24 LBVC's
for resale. 

The inventor has a cause of action against the owner of the retail specialty shop for breach of contract only if 

A: The inventor, as inventor of the LBVC, was not a merchant.
B: the invoice restriction was a material alteration of the pre-existing terms.
C: the inventor's written reply that quoted $39.99 per LBVC, but did not contain a restriction on retail sales,
was not an offer that the owner of the retail specialty shop accepted by ordering 24 LBVC's.
D: the owner of the retail specialty shop was consciously aware when taking delivery of the goods that the
television ad had said, "Not available in stores."

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. If the inventor's written reply were construed as an offer, the owner of the retail specialty
shop accepted that offer when it tendered the requested payment and did not attempt to state additional or
different terms in its acceptance. The inventor's letter with shipment, which contained an additional provision,
would have no legal effect, and the inventor would not have a cause of action against the owner of the retail
specialty shop. However, answer C assumes that the inventor's written reply that quoted $39.99 was not an
offer. Based on that assumption, the inventor's shipment of the LBVCs with the attached invoice stating "these
items shall not be offered for resale at retail" would be considered an offer and the owner of the retail specialty
shop's acceptance and display of the products after reading the invoice would be considered an acceptance of
the offer. Because the owner of the retail specialty shop accepted the offer, which included the provision
restricting resale of the products, the inventor would have a cause of action against the owner. 

Answer A is incorrect because merchant status does not govern all transactions involving the sale of goods
and is not necessary for the owner of the retail specialty shop's acceptance to be valid. B is incorrect because
the relevance of the invoice as a material alteration under the UCC battle of the forms provision, 2-207, is
relevant only if the inventor was determined to be the offeree. Here, the owner of the retail specialty shop was
the offeree and its acceptance was valid. D is incorrect because the language, "Not available in stores," could
not reasonably be construed as a prohibition on resale, and the inventor's letter to the owner of the retail
specialty shop contained no such restriction.

Question 496 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

The German-made Doppelpferd is the most popular automobile in the United States. Its U.S. sales are
booming, and the average retail markup in such sales is 30 percent. A franchised Doppelpferd dealer in the
United States contracted with a purchaser to sell him a new Doppelpferd for $9,000 cash, the sale to be
consummated after delivery to the dealer of the car, which the dealer ordered for the purchaser. The signed
retail contractual document was a contract drafted by the dealer's lawyer, and the purchaser did not question
or object to any of its terms, including the price inserted by the dealer. When the car arrived from Germany, the
purchaser repudiated the contract. The dealer at once sold the car for $9,000 cash to another interested buyer,
for whom the dealer had also ordered from the manufacturer a Doppelpferd identical to the purchaser's. 

In an action against the purchaser for breach of contract, the dealer will probably recover 

A: $9,000 minus what it cost the dealer to purchase the car from the manufacturer.
B: $9,000 minus the wholesale price of an identical Doppelpferd in the local wholesale market among dealers.
C: nominal damages only, because the dealer resold the car to the other interested buyer without lowering the
retail price.
D: nothing, because the parties' agreement was an adhesion contract and therefore unconscionable.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The dealer is a volume seller, and is therefore entitled to recover the expected profits lost
due to the repudiated sale even if the car is subsequently resold at the same price. The dealer's expectation
recovery under the contract is the purchase price paid by the purchaser minus the cost the dealer incurred in
obtaining the car. 

B and C are incorrect because the dealer is a volume seller, and even though he was able to resell the car, the
dealer is still entitled to the lost profits from the earlier sale. A resale to another buyer does not compensate for
the lost sale. D is incorrect. A contract of adhesion is not present simply because a product is in great demand
and therefore scarce and market prices are 30% above retail. Beyond the mark-up, there are no other facts
present to establish that this contract was a standardized agreement whereby one party (the dealer) dictated
its unilateral will on many others in the form of a standard contract.

Question 503 - Contracts - Discharge of Contractual Duties

 The question was: 

On January 1, a builder and a landlowner agreed in writing that the builder would build a house on the
landowner's lot according to the landowner's plans and specifications for $60,000, the work to commence on
April 1. The landowner agreed to make an initial payment of $10,000 on April 1, and to pay the balance upon
completion of the work. 

On February 1, the builder notified the landowner that he (the builder) would lose money on the job at that
price and would not proceed with the work unless the landowner would agree to increase the price to $90,000.
The landowner thereupon, without notifying the builder, agreed in writing with a third-party for the third-party,
commencing April 1, to build the house for $75,000, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done. 

On April 1, both the builder and the third-party showed up at the building site to begin work, the builder telling
the landowner that he had decided to "take the loss" and would build the house for $60,000 as originally
agreed. The landowner dismissed the builder and allowed the third-party to begin work on the house. 

In a contract action by the builder against the landowner, which of the following would the court decide under
the prevailing American view? 

A: The landowner will win, because the builder in legal effect committed a total breach of contract.
B: The landowner will win, because the third-party's contract price was $15,000 lower than the $90,000
demanded by the builder on February 1.
C: The builder will win, because the landowner did not tell him before April 1 about the contract with the
third-party
D: The builder will win, because he attempted to perform the contract as originally agreed.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. When the builder contacted the landowner on February 1 stating that he would not
perform unless the landowner paid the builder more money for the same work, the builder was in total breach
of the contract because his statement to the landlord made it clear that he was going to breach when
performance became due. This statement was an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement. 

B is incorrect because the landowner's agreement with the third-party is not evidence as to the builder's liability
under the first agreement. This second agreement with the third-party instead satisfies the landowner's duty to
mitigate damages via a substitute transaction. C is incorrect because the builder was in total breach of the
agreement on February 1, and the landowner's duties under the contract were discharged. D is incorrect
because his attempt at performance was subsequent to a discharge of the landowner's duties under the
contract.

Question 504 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

On January 1, a builder and a landowner agreed in writing that the builder would build a house on the
landowner's lot according to the landowner's plans and specifications for $60,000, the work to commence on
April 1. The landowner agreed to make an initial payment of $10,000 on April 1, and to pay the balance upon
completion of the work. 

On February 1, the builder notified the landowner that he (the builder) would lose money on the job at that
price, and would not proceed with the work unless the landowner would agree to increase the price to $90,000.
The landowner thereupon, without notifying the builder, agreed in writing with a third-party for the third-party,
commencing April 1, to build the house for $75,000, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done. 

On April 1, both the builder and the third-party showed up at the building site to begin work, the builder telling
the landowner that he had decided to "take the loss" and would build the house for $60,000 as originally
agreed. The landowner dismissed the builder and allowed the third-party to begin work on the house. 

The third-party finished the house on schedule and then showed the landowner that he (the third-party) had
spent $85,000 on the job. The landowner thereupon paid the third-party the full balance of their contract price
plus an additional $10,000, so that the third-party would not lose money. 

In a contract action by the landowner against the builder, the landowner will recover 

A: the difference between the fair market value of the completed house and the builder's original contract
price.
B: $30,000, the difference between the builder's original contract price and the amount the builder demanded
on February 1.
C: $25,000, the difference between the builder's original contract price and the total amount the landowner
paid the third-party for building the house.
D: $15,000, the difference between the builder's original contract price and the third-party's contract price.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The landowner is entitled to damages representing the difference between the original
contract price with the builder ($60,000) and his contract price with the third-party ($75,000). He is not entitled
to an additional amount representing the $10,000 extra that he paid the third-party because he was not
contractually obligated to pay that amount to the third-party. It would, therefore, not be a part of the actual loss
he avoided by the substitute transaction. For this reason C is incorrect. 

A is incorrect because this would not represent the landowner's expectation interest under his contract with the
builder. B is incorrect because this amount would not represent his actual loss on his contract with the builder.
It would not represent a consequential or incidental loss due to the builder's breach because the landowner did
not incur an obligation to pay the amount the builder demanded on February 1.

Question 524 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

On January 2, a landowner and a builder entered into a written contract in which the builder agreed to build on
the landowner's lot a new house for the landowner, according to plans and specifications furnished by the
landowner's architect at a contract price of $200,000. The contract provided for specified progress payments
and a final payment of $40,000 upon the landowner's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of
final approval by the architect. Further, under a "liquidated damages" clause in the agreement, the builder
promised to pay the homeowner $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October
1. The homeowner, however, told the builder on January 2, before the contract was signed, that he would be
on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house
until November 1. 

Because she was overextended on other construction jobs, the builder did not complete the house until
October 15. The landowner returned on November 1 as planned and occupied the house. Ten days later, after
making the $40,000 final payment to the builder, the landowner learned for the first time that the house had not
been completed until October 15. 

If the landowner sues the builder for breach of contract on account of the fifteen-day delay in completion,
which of the following will the court probably decide? 

A: The homeowner will recover damages as specified in the contract, i.e., $500 multiplied by fifteen.
B: The homeowner will recover his actual damages, if any, caused by the delay in completion.
C: Having waived the delay by occupying the house and making the final payment, the landowner will recover
nothing.
D: The landowner will recover nothing because the contractual completion date was impliedly modified to
November 1 when the landowner on January 2 advised the builder about the landowner's prospective trip and
return date.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. Both parties knew that the landowner would not be available to take possession on
October 1. The liquidated damages provision thus operates as a penalty and will not be enforced because it
does not fix damages in light of anticipated or actual harm. Damages will thus be limited to any harm the
landowner suffered in taking possession two weeks after the stated completion date. For this reason, A is
incorrect. C is incorrect because occupation and payment without knowledge of the delay cannot constitute a
voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a right. D is incorrect because this statement, standing alone, is
insufficient to indicate the landowner's intent to modify the completion date.

Question 525 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

On January 2, a landowner and a builder entered into a written contract in which the builder agreed to build on
the landowner's lot a new house for the landowner, according to plans and specifications furnished by the
landowner's architect at a contract price of $200,000. The contract provided for specified progress payments
and a final payment of $40,000 upon the landowner's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of
final approval by the architect. Further, under a "liquidated damages" clause in the agreement, the builder
promised to pay the landowner $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October
1. The landowner, however, told the builder on January 2, before the contract was signed, that he would be on
an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until
November 1. 

The builder completed the house on October 14 and, when the landowner returned on November 1, requested
the final payment of $40,000 and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. The landowner,
however, refused to pay any part of the final installment after the architect told him that the builder "did a great
job and I find no defects worth mentioning; but the builder's contract price was at least $40,000 too high,
especially in view of the big drop in housing values within the past ten months. I will withhold the final
certificate, and you just hold on to your money." 

If the builder sues the landowner for the $40,000 final payment after the architect's refusal to issue a final
certificate, which of the following will the court probably decide? 

A: The builder wins, because nonoccurrence of the condition requiring the architects's certificate of final
approval was excused by the architects's bad-faith refusal to issue the certificate.
B: The builder wins, but, because all contractual conditions have not occurred, her recovery is limited to
restitution of the benefit conferred on the landowner, minus progress payments already received.
C: The landowner wins, because he can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the fair-market value of
the completed house is $160,000 or less.
D: The landowner wins, because he can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the total payment to the
builder of $160,000 will yield a fair net profit.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. The condition in the contract requiring a certificate of final approval was withheld in bad
faith and will be excused. It was not withheld because the house did not meet specifications, but rather to
induce the builder to lower her fee because the housing market had fallen during the ten-month period during
which the builder was performing under the contract. 

B is incorrect because the condition is excused; the builder is entitled to her expectation recovery under the
contract, the final $40,000 payment, and not an equitable theory of recovery. C is incorrect because the
present fair market value is not relevant to the certificate of approval, which is based upon compliance with the
architect's specifications and completion of the construction in a workmanlike manner. D is incorrect because
the parties' agreement is enforceable as to the price to be paid for the house.

Question 570 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A testator, whose nephew was his only heir, died leaving a will that gave his entire estate to charity. The
nephew, knowing full well that the testator was of sound mind all of his life, and having no evidence to the
contrary, nevertheless filed a suit contesting the testator's will on the ground that the testator was incompetent
when the will was signed. The testator's executor, offered the nephew $5,000 to settle the suit, and the
nephew agreed. 

If the executor then repudiates the agreement and the foregoing facts are proved or admitted in the nephew's
suit against the executor for breach of contract, is the nephew entitled to recover under the prevailing view? 

A: Yes, because the nephew-executor agreement was a bargained for exchange.
B: Yes, because the law encourages the settlement of disputed claims.
C: No, because the nephew did not bring the will contest in good faith.
D: No, because an agreement to oust the court of its jurisdiction to decide a will contest is contrary to public
policy.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. The nephew did not provide consideration when he agreed to settle his claim against the
testator's estate because he knew that he was surrendering an invalid claim. Answer A is incorrect because
although the nephew bargained for the settlement, he knew he was not agreeing to surrender any right at the
time he entered into the agreement. Answer B is incorrect because although the law encourages settlement, it
does so when the settlement is undertaken based upon the good faith belief that the party is relinquishing a
valid claim. Answer D is incorrect because parties can modify legal rights and settle disputes so long as they
do so in good faith.

Question 583 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

On August 1, a geriatric company operating a "lifetime care" home for the elderly admitted an 84-year-old man
for a trial period of two months. On September 25, the 84-year-old man and the geriatric company entered into
a written lifetime care contract with an effective commencement date of October 1. The full contract price was
$20,000, which, as required by the terms of the contract, the 84-year-old man prepaid to the geriatric company
on September 25. The 84-year-old man died of a heart attack on October 2. 

In a restitutionary action, can the administratrix of the 84-year-old man's estate, a surviving sister, recover on
behalf of the estate either all or part of the $20,000 paid to the geriatric company on September 25? 

A: Yes, because the geriatric company would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the 84-year-old man's
expense.
B: Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.
C: No, because the 84-year-old man's life span and the duration of the geriatric company's commitment to him
was a risk assumed by both parties.
D: No, because the geriatric company can show that between September 25 and the 84-year-old man's death
it rejected, because of its commitment to the 84-year-old man, an application for lifetime care from another
elderly person.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Restitution generally is not available to recover a benefit conferred pursuant to a valid and
binding contract. When determining whether a contract may be unenforceable on grounds of unconscionability,
the fairness of the exchange is determined as of the time that the contract was entered into. Although the price
of $20,000 may seem unfair as of October 2, the risk that the 84-year-old man would die within a short period
was one that he assumed when he entered into the contract on September 25. 

A is incorrect because the benefit was conferred pursuant to a binding contract. B is incorrect because there
was no frustration of purpose, the man was given care for the remainder of his life. D is incorrect because the
company may enforce the contract at law and does not need to show detrimental reliance.

Question 588 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

The plaintiff, a baseball star, contracted with the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, Inc., to perform for $5,000 at
a children's concert as narrator of "Peter and the Wolf." Shortly before the concert, the baseball star became
embroiled in a highly publicized controversy over whether he had cursed and assaulted a baseball fan. The
orchestra canceled the contract out of concern that attendance might be adversely affected by the baseball
star's appearance. 

The baseball star sued the orchestra for breach of contract. His business agent testified without contradiction
that the cancellation had resulted in the baseball star's not getting other contracts for performances and
endorsements. 

The trial court instructed the jury, in part, as follows: "If you find for the plaintiff, you may award damages for
losses which at the time of contracting could reasonably have been foreseen by the defendant as a probable
result of its breach. However, the law does not permit recovery for the loss of prospective profits of a new
business caused by breach of contract." 

On the baseball star's appeal from a jury verdict for the baseball star, and judgment thereon, awarding
damages only of the $5,000 fee promised by the orchestra, the judgment will probably be 

A: affirmed, because the trial court stated the law correctly.
B: affirmed, because the issue of damages for breach of contract was solely a jury question.
C: reversed, because the test for limiting damages is what the breaching party could reasonably have
foreseen at the time of the breach.
D: reversed, because under the prevailing modern view, lost profits of a new business are recoverable if they
are established with a reasonable certainty.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. In order to recover lost profit damages, the plaintiff must prove that the losses suffered
were substantially certain and not simply speculative. In this case there is uncontroverted testimony that there
were forgone profits, and such testimony could establish an amount of damages with reasonable certainty.
Therefore, the judgment should be reversed because the jury instructions were improper and the baseball star
may be entitled to greater damages. A is incorrect because the trial court's jury instructions stated the outdated
traditional rule regarding a new business's ability to recover damages. B is incorrect because the issue is one
of law and fact. C is incorrect because certainty, not foreseeability, is the proper limiting test in this situation.

Question 598 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

Under a written agreement, a pastry company promised to sell its entire output of baked buns at a specified
unit price to a baked goods retailer for one year. The baked goods retailer promised not to sell any other
supplier's baked buns. 

Shortly after making the contract, and before the pastry company had tendered any buns, the baked goods
retailer decided that the contract had become undesirable because of a sudden, sharp decline in its customers'
demand for baked buns. It renounced the agreement and the pastry company sues for breach of contract. 

Which of the following will the court probably decide? 

A: The baked goods retailer wins, because mutuality of obligation was lacking in that the baked goods retailer
made no express promise to buy any of the pastry company's baked buns.
B: The baked goods retailer wins, because the agreement was void for indefiniteness of quantity and total
price for the year involved.
C: The pastry company wins, because the baked goods retailer's promise to sell at retail the pastry company's
baked buns exclusively, if it sold any such buns at all, implied a promise to use its best efforts to sell the pastry
company's one-year output of baked buns.
D: The pastry company wins, because under applicable law both parties to a sale-of-goods contract impliedly
assume the risk of price and demand fluctuations.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. Under the UCC, a contract for exclusive dealing in a good imposes on the part of the
seller an obligation to use best efforts to supply the good and an obligation on the part of the buyer to use its
best efforts to promote the good's sale. Therefore the baked goods retailer was under an implied obligation to
use its best efforts to promote the sale of the pastry company's buns for the duration of the contract. 

Choice A is incorrect because the contract implied an obligation on the part of the baked goods retailer to use
its best efforts to promote the sale of the buns. B is incorrect because output contracts are not void for lack of
indefiniteness. D is incorrect because it does not identify the legal rule that is at issue in the problem.

Question 605 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

On July 18, a shovel manufacturer received an order for the purchase of 500 snow shovels from a wholesaler.
The wholesaler had mailed the purchase order on July 15. The order required shipment of the shovels no
earlier than September 15 and no later than October 15. Typed conspicuously across the front of the order
form was the following: "[the wholesaler] reserves the right to cancel this order at any time before September
1." The manufacturer's mailed response, saying "We accept your order," was received by the wholesaler on
July 21. 

As of July 22, which of the following is an accurate statement as to whether a contract was formed? 

A: No contract was formed, because of the wholesaler's reservation of the right to cancel.
B: No contract was formed, because the wholesaler's order was only a revocable offer.
C: A contract was formed, but prior to September 1 it was terminable at the will of either party.
D: A contract was formed, but prior to September 1 it was an option contract terminable only at the will of the
wholesaler.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. A promise is not consideration to support a return promise if by its terms the promisor
unconditionally reserves the right of alternative performances, such as reserving the right to cancel an order.
Such a promise is an illusory promise. When the wholesaler reserved the right to cancel the order at any time
before September 1, this meant that as of July 22, the wholesaler gave only an illusory promise to purchase
the shovels. Therefore, as of that time the contract was not enforceable against either party. 

B is incorrect because, in general, offers are revocable and a contract may be formed as long as an offer is not
actually revoked. Because there is no indication in the fact pattern that the offer was revoked, a valid contract
may have been formed. C is incorrect because a contract was not formed as of July 22 and because only the
wholesaler reserved the right to terminate. D is incorrect because a contract was not formed as of July 22 and
because the facts do not suggest that the manufacturer gave the wholesaler an option.

Question 606 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

On July 18, a shovel manufacturer received an order for the purchase of 500 snow shovels from a wholesaler.
The wholesaler had mailed the purchase order on July 15. The order required shipment of the shovels no
earlier than September 15 and no later than October 15. Typed conspicuously across the front of the order
form was the following: "[the wholesaler] reserves the right to cancel this order at any time before September
1." The manufacturer's mailed response, saying "We accept your order," was received by the wholesaler on
July 21. 

The wholesaler did not cancel the order, and the manufacturer shipped the shovels to the wholesaler on
September 15. When the shovels, conforming to the order in all respects, arrived on October 10, the
wholesaler refused to accept them. 

Which of the following is an accurate statement as of October 10 after the wholesaler rejected the shovels? 

A: The wholesaler's order for the shovels, even if initially illusory, became a binding promise to accept and pay
for them.
B: The wholesaler's order was an offer that became an option after shipment by the manufacturer.
C: The wholesaler's right to cancel was a condition subsequent, the failure of which resulted in an enforceable
contract.
D: In view of the wholesaler's right to cancel its order prior to September 1, the shipment of the shovels on
September 15 was only an offer by the manufacturer.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. An illusory promise may become consideration if the time during which the promisor could
choose alternative performances has passed. Although reserving the right to terminate a contract for a
specified period makes a promise illusory, the promise becomes consideration once the period for exercising
the right to terminate has passed. Therefore, because the wholesaler did not exercise its right to cancel the
order, the manufacturer became bound to the contract as of September 1. 

B and D are incorrect because both parties became bound to a contract as of September 1. C is incorrect
because no language that indicates the existence of condition subsequent, and even if there were such
language, the failure of a condition subsequent would not create an enforceable contract.

Question 611 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A high-volume, pleasure-boat retailer entered into with a boater, a written contract signed by both parties, to
sell the boater a power boat for $12,000. The manufacturer's price of the boat delivered to the retailer was
$9,500. As the contract provided, the boater paid the retailer $4,000 in advance and promised to pay the full
balance upon delivery of the boat. The contract contained no provision for liquidated damages. Prior to the
agreed delivery date, the boater notified the retailer that he would be financially unable to conclude the
purchase; the retailer thereupon resold the same boat that the boater had ordered to a third person for
$12,000. 

If the boater sues the retailer for restitution of the $4,000 advance payment, which of the following should the
court decide? 

A: The boater's claim should be denied, because, as the party in default, he is deemed to have lost any right to
restitution of a benefit conferred on the retailer.
B: The boater's claim should be denied, because, but for his repudiation, the retailer would have made a profit
on two boat-sales instead of one.
C: The boater's claim should be upheld in the amount of $4,000 minus the amount of the retailer's lost profit
under its contract with the boater.
D: The boater's claims should be upheld in the amount of $3,500 ($4,000 minus $500 as statutory damages
under the UCC).

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer C is correct. By repudiating his obligation to pay the remainder of the contract price, the boater
breached and the retailer is entitled to recover expectation damages. Since the retailer is a volume seller,
under UCC article 2 the retailer is entitled to the expected profit from the lost sale even though the same
product was resold at the original price. Therefore, the boater will only be able to recover his down payment of
$4,000 minus the profit lost by the retailer from having the original sale fall through. 

A is incorrect because it would be unjust enrichment for the retailer to retain an amount greater than its losses
under the contract. B is incorrect, but has the correct reasoning. The retailer is entitled to the expected profit
from the lost sale, but is not automatically entitled to the full $4,000 advance payment. D is incorrect because
as the party who breached the contract, the boater is not entitled to damages. The boater is only entitled to the
restitution of the down payment which exceeds the damages caused by his breach.

Question 622 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

A developer, needing a water well on one of his projects, met several times about the matter with a well driller.
Subsequently, the well driller sent a developer an unsigned typewritten form captioned "WELL DRILLING
PROPOSAL" and stating various terms the two had discussed but not agreed upon, including a "proposed
price of $5,000." The form concluded, "This proposal will not become a contract until signed by you [the
developer] and then returned to and signed by me [the well driller]." 

The developer signed the form and returned it to the well driller, who neglected to sign it but promptly began
drilling the well at the proposed site on the developer's project. After drilling for two days, the well driller told
the developer during one of the developer's daily visits that he would not finish unless the developer would
agree to pay twice the price recited in the written proposal. The developer refused, the well driller quit, and the
developer hired substitute to drill the well to completion for a price of $7,500. 

In an action by the developer against the well driller for damages, which of the following is the probable
decision? 

A: The developer wins, because his signing of the well driller's form constituted an acceptance of an offer by
the well driller.
B: The developer wins, because the well driller's commencement of performance constituted an acceptance
by the well driller of an offer by the developer and an implied promise by the well driller to complete the well.
C: The well driller wins, because he never signed the proposal as required by its terms.
D: The well driller wins, because his commencement of performance merely prevented the developer from
revoking his offer, made on a form supplied by the well driller, and did not obligate the well driller to complete
the well.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. An offer is a manifestation of a willingness to bargain that creates a capacity in the offeree
to form a contract by consent. Since the form that the well driller sent to the developer stated that the proposal
would not be a contract until signed by both parties, it is not an offer because it does not manifest an intent to
conclude a contract upon mere signing by the developer. However, after the developer signed the form, the
form became an offer that the well driller could accept either by signing the form or by manifesting assent in
some other way (such as by commencing performance). 

A is incorrect because the developer's signing of the form amounted to an offer and not an acceptance. C is
incorrect because the well driller manifested assent by commencing performance. D is incorrect because the
offer sought a return promise, which the well driller implicitly made by commencing performance.

Question 626 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A property owner and a landscape architect signed a detailed writing in which the landscape architect agreed
to landscape the owner's residential property in accordance with a design prepared by the landscape architect
and incorporated in the writing. The owner agreed to pay $10,000 for the work upon its completion. The
owner's spouse was not a party to the agreement, and had no ownership interest in the premises. 

At the owner's insistence, the written owner-architect agreement contained a provision that neither party would
be bound unless the owner's law partner, an avid student of landscaping, should approve the landscape
architect's design. Before the landscape architect commenced the work, the owner's law partner, in the
presence of both the owner and the landscape architect, expressly disapproved the landscaping design.
Nevertheless, the owner ordered the landscape architect to proceed with the work, and the landscape architect
reluctantly did so. When the landscape architect's performance was 40% complete, the owner repudiated his
duty, if any, to pay the contract price or any part thereof. 

If the landscape architect now sues the owner for damages for breach of contract, which of the following
concepts best supports the landscape architect's claim? 

A: Substantial performance.
B: Promissory estoppel.
C: Irrevocable waiver of condition.
D: Unjust enrichment.

The explanation for the answer is:

Choice C is correct. The nonoccurrence of an express condition will discharge the contractual obligation of a
party who is subject to the condition, unless the nonoccurrence of the condition has been waived by that party.
Once the waiver has been given, it cannot be revoked where it is made after the time for the fulfillment of the
condition has passed or where the other party has relied on the waiver. Therefore, although the express
condition to the owner-architect agreement did not occur (since the necessary approval was not given), the
owner waived the condition when the owner ordered the work to proceed. Since the waiver occurred after the
nonoccurrence of the condition, and since the landscape architect relied on the waiver by completing 40% of
the work, the owner may not revoke the waiver. 

Choice A is incorrect because substantial performance is not applicable where performance is subject to an
express condition. Choices B and D are incorrect because the landscape architect's claim is better supported
on a breach of contract theory.

Question 634 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties

 The question was: 

An expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, contracted in a signed writing to lift and
emplace certain air-conditioning equipment atop a builder's building. An exculpatory clause in the contract
provided that the expert would not be liable for any physical damage to the builder's building occurring during
installation of the air-conditioning equipment. There was also a clause providing for per diem damages if the
expert did not complete performance by a specified date and a clause providing that "time is of the essence."
Another clause provided that any subsequent agreement for extra work under the contract must be in writing
and signed by both parties. 

With ample time remaining under the contract for commencement and completion of his performance, the
expert notified the builder that he was selling his business to a man who was equally expert in lifting and
emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, and that the man had agreed to "take over the expert-builder
contract." 

Assume that the builder orally agreed with the expert to accept the man's services and that the man performed
on time but negligently installed the wrong air-conditioning equipment. 

Will the builder succeed in an action against the expert for damages for breach of contract?  

A: Yes, because the builder did not agree to release the expert from liability under the expert-builder contract.
B: Yes, because the builder received no consideration for the substitution of the man for the expert.
C: No, because by accepting the substitution of the man for the expert, the builder effected a novation, and the
expert was thereby discharged of his duties under the expert-builder contract.
D: No, because the liquidated-damage clause in the expert-builder contract provided only for damages caused
by delay in performance.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Unless the other party to the contract (the obligee) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a
novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual
duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor. Although the builder orally agreed to accept
the delegation of the expert's duties to the man, that agreement did not effect a novation, or a release of the
expert's obligation under the contract. 

B is incorrect because a delegation does not require consideration to be effective. C is incorrect because an
acceptance of delegation is not the same as a novation. D is incorrect because a liquidated damages provision
for delay does not preclude recovery of other types of damages resulting from a breach.

Question 645 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

The aged mother of a sister and brother, both adults, wished to employ a live-in companion so that she might
continue to live in her own home. Their mother, however, had only enough income to pay one-half of the
companion's $2,000 monthly salary. Learning of their mother's plight, the siblings agreed with each other in a
signed writing that on the last day of January and each succeeding month during their mother's lifetime, each
would give their mother $500. Their mother then hired the companion. 

The siblings made the agreed payments in January, February, and March. In April, however, the brother
refused to make any payment and notified his sister and mother that he would make no further payments. 

Will their mother succeed in an action for $500 brought against the brother after April 30? 

A: Yes, because by making his first three payments, the brother confirmed his intent to contract.
B: Yes, because the mother is an intended beneficiary of a contract between the siblings.
C: No, because a parent cannot sue her child for breach of a promise for support.
D: No, because the siblings intended their payment to their mother to be gifts.

The explanation for the answer is:

B is correct. The mother was not a party to the contract between the sister and the brother, so the only way for
her to have contractual rights is if she was the intended beneficiary of the contract. For the mother to be an
intended beneficiary, she must be the person to whom performance is to be given. In this case several factors
indicate that the mother is an intended beneficiary: the mother is named in the contract, the mother directly
receives the payments, and the mother has a close familial relationship with the parties. Therefore, the mother
is an intended beneficiary and will prevail in a suit against the brother for the $500 payment. 

A is incorrect because modern contract law is based upon the objective test, which does not consider a party's
private intent. The brother's intent is irrelevant. Further, whether a contract was formed is not at issue. The
issue is whether the mother has contractual rights that may be asserted. 

C is incorrect because the mother is simply asserting her rights as an intended beneficiary to the contract; her
claim is not solely based on her relationship to the son. Furthermore, there is no rule of contract law which
states that a parent may not sue a child. 

D is incorrect because the promise to pay $500 was made in exchange for a mutual promise to pay the other
$500. Because consideration was present, a contract was formed, and the $500 payments will not be
considered gifts.

Question 646 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

The aged mother of a sister and brother, both adults, wished to employ a live-in companion so that she might
continue to live in her own home. The mother, however, had only enough income to pay one-half of the
companion's $2,000 monthly salary. Learning of their mother's plight, the sister and brother agreed with each
other in a signed writing that on the last day of January and each succeeding month during their mother's
lifetime, each would give their mother $500. Their mother then hired the companion. 

The siblings made the agreed payments in January, February, and March. In April, however, the brother
refused to make any payment and notified his sister and their mother that he would make no further
payments. 

There is a valid contract between the siblings, but their mother has declined to sue the brother. 

Will the sister succeed in an action against the brother in which she asks the court to order the brother to
continue to make his payments to their mother under the terms of the the sibling's contract? 

A: Yes, because the sister's remedy at law is inadequate.
B: Yes, because the sister's burden of supporting her mother will be increased if her brother does not
contribute his share.
C: No, because a court will not grant specific performance of a promise to pay money.
D: No, because the brother's breach of contract has caused no economic harm to the sister.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. A court may grant specific performance of a contractual obligation where an award of
monetary damages is inadequate - in other words, where damages would not be a just or reasonable
substitute for performance of the promise, or where calculation of adequate damages would be impracticable.
Here the calculation of adequate damages would be impracticable because it is impossible to know how many
months the mother will live. Therefore, the sister should be entitled to specific performance.  

B is incorrect because the brother's breach does not impose a legal duty on the sister to pay the difference. C
is incorrect as a misstatement of the law; the court will not grant specific performance of service contracts, but
the promise to pay money is not a service contract. D is incorrect because the absence of economic harm to
the sister does not preclude recovery for breach of contract.

Question 657 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

A retailer of guns in a state received on June 1 the following signed letter from a gun-wholesaler in another
state: "We have just obtained 100 of the assault rifles you inquired about and can supply them for $250 each.
We can guarantee shipment no later than August 1." 

On June 10, the wholesaler sold and delivered the same rifles to another merchant for $300 each. Unaware of
that transaction, the retailer on the morning of June 11 mailed the wholesaler a letter rejecting the latter's offer,
but, changing his mind an hour later, retrieved from his local post office the letter of rejection and immediately
dispatched to the wholesaler a letter of acceptance, which the wholesaler received on June 14. 

On June 9, a valid federal statute making the interstate sale of assault rifles punishable as a crime had
become effective, but neither the retailer nor the wholesaler was aware until June 15 that the statute was
already in effect. 

As between the retailer and the wholesaler, which of the following is an accurate statement? 

A: No contract was formed, because of wholesaler's June 10 sale of the rifles to another merchant revoked the
offer to the retailer.
B: If a contract was formed, it is voidable because of mutual mistake.
C: If a contract was formed, it is unenforceable because of supervening impracticability.
D: No contract was formed, because the retailer's June 11 rejection was effective on dispatch.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B or C is correct. A party's obligation under a contract may be discharged on grounds of mutual
mistake if the mistake related to a basic assumption of the contract having a material effect on the exchange,
and if the party seeking discharge should not bear the risk of the mistake. Similarly, a party's obligation under a
contract may be discharged on grounds of supervening impracticability if the impracticability is due to an event,
the nonoccurrence of which is a basic assumption of the contract, occurring without the fault of either party,
and where the party seeking discharge should not bear the risk of the event. Because the federal statute
criminalizes the performance required under the contract (the interstate sale of assault rifles), it relates to a
basic assumption of the contract and renders performance impracticable for both the retailer and the
wholesaler. Because neither party had reason to know that the statute would be enacted, neither party should
bear the risk of the event. 

Choice A is incorrect because revocation of an offer is only effective when the offeree receives notice of the
revocation. Choice D is incorrect because notice of a rejection is effective upon receipt (the mail box rule only
applies to an acceptance).

Question 666 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A man owed his friend $1,000, plus interest at 8% until paid, on a long-overdue promissory note, collection of
which would become barred by the statute of limitations on June 30. On the preceding April 1, the man and his
friend both signed a writing in which the man promised to pay the note in full on the following December 31,
plus interest at 8% until that date, and the friend promised not to sue on the note in the meantime. The friend,
having received some advice from his nonlawyer brother-in-law, became concerned about the legal effect of
the April 1 agreement. On May 1, acting pro se as permitted by the rules of the local small claims court, he
filed suit to collect the note. 

Assuming that there is no controlling statute, is the April 1 agreement an effective defense for the man? 

A: Yes, because the man's promise to pay interest until December 31 was consideration for the friend's
promise not to sue.
B: Yes, because the law creates a presumption that the man relied on his friend's promise not to sue.
C: No, because there was no consideration for the friend's promise not to sue, in that the man was already
obligated to pay $1,000 plus interest at 8% until the payment date.
D: No, because the man's April 1 promise is enforceable with or without consideration.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Generally, a promise to perform a preexisting legal duty is not sufficient consideration to
support a return promise. Since the man was already obligated to pay the friend $1000 at 8% interest,
normally a promise to do the same would not be sufficient consideration to support the friend's promise to
refrain from suit. However, the man offered to extend interest payments until December 31 in consideration for
the friend's promise not to sue during the remaining time under the statute of limitations. Therefore, there was
adequate consideration for the April 1 agreement, and it will provide an effective defense against the friend's
claim. 

B is incorrect because the man does not need to rely on detrimental reliance because there was adequate
consideration for the April 1 agreement. C is incorrect because the payment of interest for six additional
months is adequate consideration. D is incorrect because the April 1 agreement would provide an adequate
defense against the friend's claim.

Question 677 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A borrower asked a lender to lend her $1,000. The lender replied that he would do so only if the borrower's
father would guarantee the loan. At the borrower's request, the father mailed a signed letter to the lender: "If
you lend $1,000 to my daughter, I will repay it if she doesn't." On September 15, the lender, having read the
father's letter, lent $1,000 to the borrower, which the borrower agreed to repay in installments of $100 plus
accrued interest on the last day of each month beginning October 31. The father died on September 16. Later
that same day, unaware of the father's death, the lender mailed a letter to the father advising that he had made
the $1,000 loan to the borrower on September 15. 

The borrower did not pay the installments due on October 31, November 30, or December 31, and has
informed the lender that she will be unable to make repayments in the foreseeable future. 

On January 15, the lender is entitled to a judgment against the borrower for which of the following amounts? 

A: Nothing, because if he sues before the entire amount is due, he will be splitting his cause of action.
B: $300 plus the accrued interest, because the borrower's breach is only a partial breach.
C: $1,000 plus the accrued interest, because the borrower's unexcused failure to pay three installments is a
material breach.
D: $1,000 plus the accrued interest, because the failure to pay her debts as they come due indicates that the
borrower is insolvent and the lender is thereby entitled to accelerate payment of the debt.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, an unequivocal statement of unwillingness
or inability to perform a future contractual obligation, if material, may be treated as a total breach of that
obligation and give rise to a right to immediately recover damages for that breach. A repudiation of a duty will
not operate as a total breach, however, if it occurs after the repudiating party has received all of the agreed
exchange for that duty. In such a case, the non-repudiating party must wait until the obligation becomes due
before enforcing it. Although the borrower failed to make three repayments of the debt and expressed her
inability to repay the debt in the future, the lender cannot accelerate the debt unless the contract specified
otherwise. Therefore, the lender can only recover for the three months of unpaid debt that is due and
outstanding as of January 15. 

Answer A is incorrect because the lender can recover the amount that is due as of January 15. Answer C is
incorrect because the breach will be treated as a partial breach. Answer D is incorrect because the debt may
not be accelerated unless the contract expressly so provides.

Question 689 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation

 The question was: 

A radio manufacturer and a retailer, after extensive negotiations, entered into a final written agreement in
which the manufacturer agreed to sell and the retailer agreed to buy all of its requirements of radios, estimated
at 20 units per month, during the period January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990, at a price of $50 per unit. A
dispute arose in December, 1990, when the retailer returned 25 undefective radios to the manufacturer for full
credit after the manufacturer had refused to extend the contract for a second three-year period. 

In an action by the manufacturer against the retailer for damages due to return of the 25 radios, the
manufacturer introduces the written agreement, which expressly permitted the buyer to return defective radios
for credit but was silent as to the return of undefective radios for credit. The retailer seeks to introduce
evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned, for various reasons, 125 undefective
radios, for which the manufacturer had granted full credit. The manufacturer objects to the admissibility of this
evidence. 

The trial court will probably rule that the evidence proffered by the retailer is 

A: inadmissible, because the evidence is barred by the parol evidence rule.
B: inadmissible, because the express terms of the agreement control when those terms are inconsistent with
the course of performance.
C: admissible, because the evidence supports an agreement that is not within the relevant statute of frauds.
D: admissible, because course-of-performance evidence, when available, is considered the best indication of
what the parties intended the writing to mean.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of extrinsic evidence of certain statements
made prior to the adoption of a final written agreement. Evidence of course-of-performance, however, is
admissible to interpret a writing so long as the evidence can reasonably be construed in a way that is
consistent with the writing. Because the written agreement between the manufacturer and the retailer is silent
on the issue of returning undefective radios for credit, evidence of the parties' performance during the first
three years of the agreement on this issue is admissible to interpret the writing. 

Choice A is incorrect because the parol evidence rule does not bar the admission of course-of-performance
evidence. Choice B is incorrect because the express terms of the contract are silent on the issue of returning
undefective radios. Choice C is incorrect because the statute of frauds is not relevant to the issue of contract
interpretation.

Question 690 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A radio manufacturer and a retailer, after extensive negotiations, entered into a final written agreement in
which the manufacturer agreed to sell and the retailer agreed to buy all of its requirements of radios, estimated
at 20 units per month, during the period January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990, at a price of $50 per unit. A
dispute arose in later December, 1990, when the retailer returned 25 undefective radios to the manufacturer
for full credit after the manufacturer had refused to extend the contract for a second three-year period. 

In an action by the manufacturer against the retailer for damages due to return of the 25 radios, the
manufacturer introduces the written agreement, which expressly permitted the buyer to return defective radios
for credit but was silent as to the return of undefective radios for credit. The retailer seeks to introduce
evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned, for various reasons, 125 undefective
radios, for which the manufacturer had granted full credit. The manufacturer objects to the admissibility of this
evidence. 

Assume the following facts. When the retailer returned the 25 radios in question, it included with the shipment
a check payable to the manufacturer for the balance admittedly due on all other merchandise sold and
delivered to the retailer. The check was conspicuously marked, "Payment in full for all goods sold to the retailer
to date." The manufacturer's credit manager, reading this check notation and knowing that the retailer had also
returned the 25 radios for full credit, deposited the check without protest in the manufacturer's local bank
account. The canceled check was returned to the retailer a week later. 

Which of the following defenses would best serve the retailer? 

A: The manufacturer's deposit of the check and its return to the retailer after payment estopped the
manufacturer thereafter from asserting that the retailer owed any additional amount.
B: By depositing the check without protest and with knowledge of its wording, the manufacturer discharged
any remaining duty to pay on the part of the retailer.
C: By depositing the check without protest and with knowledge of its wording, the manufacturer entered into a
novation discharging any remaining duty to pay on the part of the retailer.
D: The parties' good faith dispute over return of the radios suspended the duty of the retailer, if any, to pay any
balance due.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. Under the rules of accord and satisfaction, a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute
by offering a check marked "payment in full." If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have
understood it, and if the amount owed to the creditor is an unliquidated sum, then cashing the check without
protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt. Although mere
payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the accord, consideration is furnished
where the amount owed to the creditor is genuinely in dispute. Because there was a good faith dispute
between the retailer and the manufacturer relating to the amount that the retailer owed, the check that was
sent to settle the dispute furnished sufficient consideration to support the manufacturer's implicit promise to
discharge the debt. 

A and D are incorrect because when the manufacturer cashed the retailer's check without protest, it accepted
the accord and satisfaction and discharged the debt. C is incorrect because there is no evidence of a novation.

Question 702 - Contracts - Impracticability and Frustration of Purpose

 The question was: 

A business owner entered into a contract with a painter, by the terms of which the painter was to paint the
owner's office for $1,000 and was required to do all of the work over the following weekend so as to avoid
disruption of the owner's business. 

Assume the following facts. The painter commenced work on Saturday morning and had finished half the
painting by the time he quit work for the day. That night, without the fault of either party, the office building was
destroyed by fire. 

Which of the following is an accurate statement? 

A: Both parties' contractual duties are discharged, and the painter can recover nothing from the owner.
B: Both parties' contractual duties are discharged, but the painter can recover in quasi-contract from the
owner.
C: Only the painter's contractual duty is discharged, because the owner's performance (payment of the agreed
price) is not impossible.
D: Only the painter's contractual duty is discharged, and the painter can recover his reliance damages from the
owner.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. When the existence of a specific thing (such as the owner's office) is necessary for the
performance of a contractual obligation, the destruction of that thing is a supervening event that relates to a
basic assumption of the contract; this effectively discharges any obligation of either party under that contract.
However, any benefit conferred under the contract prior to the supervening event may be recovered in
restitution. Therefore, the destruction of the owner's office discharged the painter's obligation to paint and the
owner's obligation to pay for the work. Payment for the work that was already done, however, is nonetheless
recoverable in restitution, or quasi contract. Answer A is incorrect because the painter can recover in
restitution. Answer C is incorrect because both parties' obligations are effectively discharged. Answer D is
incorrect because generally a party cannot recover for reliance damages when a contract has been discharged
on grounds of impossibility.

Question 709 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A seller and a buyer, standing on Greenacre, orally agreed to its sale and purchase for $5,000 and orally
marked its bounds as "that line of trees down there, the ditch that intersects them, the fence on the other side,
and that street on the fourth side." 

In which of the following is the remedy of reformation most appropriate? 

A: As later reduced to writing, the agreement by clerical mistake included two acres that are actually beyond
the fence.
B: The buyer reasonably thought that two acres beyond the fence were included in the oral agreement but the
seller did not. As later reduced to writing, the agreement included the two acres.
C: The buyer reasonably thought that the price orally agreed upon was $4,500, but the seller did not. As later
reduced to writing, the agreement said $5,000.
D: The buyer reasonably thought that a dilapidated shed backed up against the fence was to be torn down and
removed as part of the agreement, but the seller did not. As later reduced to writing, the agreement said
nothing about the shed.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. Where a clerical error has been made in reducing an agreement to writing, a party may
bring an action in equitable reformation to have the writing reformed to correct the writing or include an omitted
provision. The parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence to show the mistake that forms the
basis for reformation. Because the seller and the buyer verbally agreed that the boundary of Greenacre was
the fence, the writing may be reformed if it mistakenly includes a reference to the two acres beyond the fence.
B, C and D are incorrect because reformation is not available to correct a mistake unless the parties actually
reached an agreement prior to reducing the agreement to writing.

Question 730 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

On March 1, an apartment complex received a letter from a retailer offering to sell the apartment complex
1,200 window air conditioners suitable for the apartments in the complex's buildings. The retailer's offer stated
that it would remain open until March 20, but that the apartment complex's acceptance must be received on or
before that date. On March 16, the apartment complex posted a letter of acceptance. On March 17, the retailer
telegraphed the apartment complex to advise that it was revoking the offer. The telegram reached the
apartment complex on March 17, but the apartment complex's letter did not arrive at the retailer's address until
March 21. 

As of March 22, which of the following is a correct statement? 

A: The telegram revoking the offer was effective upon receipt.
B: The offer was revocable at any time for lack of consideration.
C: The mail was the only authorized means of revocation.
D: Under the terms of the retailer's offer, the apartment complex's attempted acceptance was ineffective.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Under the mail box rule, an acceptance is effective upon dispatch in the mail if a mailed
acceptance is invited by the terms of the offer. However, if the offer specifies otherwise, the language of the
offer controls. Although the retailer's offer stated that the apartment complex's acceptance must be received
on or before March 20, the apartment complex's attempted acceptance did not arrive until the 21st and
therefore it was ineffective. 

Answer A is incorrect because, although revocations generally are effective upon receipt, this one would not
have been effective if the apartment complex's acceptance had arrived on or before March 20. Answer B is
incorrect because, although offers generally are revocable, the retailer's offer would not have been revocable
once the apartment complex had accepted it (if it was accepted before the offer lapsed). Answer C is incorrect
because generally revocation can be effected by any means.

Question 741 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation

 The question was: 

A rancher and a fancier of horses signed the following writing: "For $5,000, the rancher will sell to the fancier a
gray horse that the fancier may choose from among the grays on the rancher's ranch." 

The fancier refused to accept delivery of a gray horse timely tendered by the rancher or to choose among
those remaining, on the ground that during their negotiations the rancher had orally agreed to include a saddle,
worth $100, and also to give the fancier the option to choose a gray or a brown horse. The fancier insisted on
one of the rancher's brown horses, but the rancher refused to part with any of his browns or with the saddle as
demanded by the fancier. 

If the fancier sues the rancher for damages and seeks to introduce evidence of the alleged oral agreement, the
court probably will 

A: admit the evidence as to both the saddle and the option to choose a brown horse.
B: admit the evidence as to the saddle but not the option to choose a brown horse.
C: admit the evidence as to the option to choose a brown horse but not the promise to include the saddle.
D: not admit any of the evidence.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer B is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of evidence of an agreement made prior to
the adoption of a final written contract if the prior agreement relates to matters within the scope of the writing.
However, if the prior agreement does not contradict the writing but merely supplements it, evidence of the prior
agreement may be admitted if the court finds that the writing is only partially integrated (it did not encompass
their entire agreement). Since the written agreement between the rancher and the fancier provides for the sale
of a gray horse, evidence of an oral agreement to sell a brown horse contradicts the writing and would
therefore be excluded under the rule. On the other hand, evidence relating to the rancher's alleged promise to
include a saddle merely supplements the writing, and therefore a court is likely to consider extrinsic evidence
on this issue if it finds that the writing is only partially integrated rather than completely integrated. 

Choices A and C are incorrect because the evidence relating to the option to choose a brown horse
contradicts the writing. Choice D is incorrect because the modern approach to the parol evidence rule permits
extrinsic evidence to be admitted to determine whether the writing is partially or completely integrated.

Question 751 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

On December 1, a broker contracted with a collector to sell her one of a certain type of rare coin for $12,000,
delivery and payment to occur on the next March 1. To fulfill that contract, and without the collector's
knowledge, the broker contracted on January 1 to purchase for $10,000 a specimen of that type of coin from a
hoarder, delivery and payment to occur on February 1. The market price of such coins had unexpectedly fallen
to $8,000 by February 1, when the hoarder tendered the coin and the broker repudiated. 

On February 25, the market in such coins suddenly reversed and had stabilized at $12,000 on March 1. The
broker, however, had failed to obtain a specimen of the coin and repudiated his agreement with the collector
when she tendered the $12,000 agreed price on March 1. 

Later that day, after learning by chance of the broker's dealing with the collector, the hoarder telephoned the
collector and said: "Listen, the broker probably owes me at least $2,000 in damages for refusing wrongfully to
buy my coin for $10,000 on February 1 when the market was down to $8,000. But I'm in good shape in view of
the market's recovery since then, and I think you ought to get after the so-and-so." 

If the collector immediately sues the broker for his breach of the broker-hoarder contract, which of the following
will the court probably decide? 

A: The broker wins, because the collector, if a beneficiary at all of the broker-hoarder contract, was only an
incidental beneficiary.
B: The broker wins, because as of March 1 neither the hoarder nor the collector had sustained any damage
from the broker's repudiation of both contracts.
C: The collector wins, because she was an intended beneficiary of the broker-hoarder contract, under which
damages for the broker's repudiation became fixed on February 1.
D: The collector wins, because she took an effective assignment of the hoarder's claim for damages against
the broker when the hoarder suggested that the collector "get after the so-and-so."

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer A is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended
beneficiary of the promise. A party is an intended beneficiary of a promise if recognition of a right to
performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intent of the parties, such as where the promisor
must know that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The collector is only an incidental
beneficiary of the broker-hoarder contract because the facts suggest that, in agreeing to sell the rare coin to
the broker on February 1, the hoarder did not intend to confer a benefit on the collector. 

Answer B is incorrect because under the UCC, damages to the hoarder were to be calculated as of the time
that the hoarder learned of the broker's repudiation, which was February 1, when the market price had fallen
below the contract price. Answer C is incorrect because the collector was only an incidental beneficiary.
Answer D is incorrect because in order to be effective, an assignment of contract rights requires language of
present transfer; the phrase "I think you ought to get after the so-and-so" was insufficient to effect an
assignment of the hoarder's rights under the hoarder-broker contract.

Question 759 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A notorious spendthrift, who was usually broke for that reason, received the following letter from his uncle, a
wealthy and prudent man: "I understand you're in financial difficulties again. I promise to give you $5,000 on
your birthday next month, but you'd better use it wisely or you'll never get another dime from me." The
spendthrift thereupon signed a contract with a car dealer to purchase a $40,000 automobile and to make a
$5,000 down payment on the day after his birthday. 

If the spendthrift sues his uncle for $5,000 after the latter learned of the car-purchase contract and then
repudiated his promise, which of the following is the uncle's best defense? 

A: A promise to make a gift in the future is not enforceable.
B: Reliance by the promisee on a promise to make a future gift does not make the promise enforceable unless
the value of the promised gift is substantially equivalent to the promisee's loss by reliance.
C: Reliance by the promisee on a promise to make a future gift does not make the promise enforceable unless
that reliance also results in an economic benefit to the promisor.
D: Reliance by the promisee on a promise to make a future gift does not make the promise enforceable unless
injustice can be avoided only by such enforcement.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. Under the theory of detrimental reliance, a gratuitous promise may be enforceable
notwithstanding lack of consideration if the party making the promise has reason to expect the promise will
induce reliance on the part of the promisee, there has been reliance in fact, and injustice may be avoided only
by enforcement of the promise. The uncle should have foreseen that his promise would induce action on the
spendthrift's part, and the spendthrift did in fact rely on the promise. However, the nature of the spendthrift's
reliance (buying a car that he could not afford) is inconsistent with the intended purpose of the uncle's gift,
which suggests that justice does not require enforcement of the promise. 

Answer A is incorrect because some gift promises are enforceable under a reliance theory. Answers B and C
are incorrect because reliance does not require equivalence between the value of the promise and the extent
of the reliance, nor does it require the reliance to confer a benefit on the promisor.

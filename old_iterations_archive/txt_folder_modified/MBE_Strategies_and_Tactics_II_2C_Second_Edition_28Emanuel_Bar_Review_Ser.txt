PREFACE

Thank you for buying this book. Its sole purpose is to help you excel on the
MBE.

Here’s how I prepared this book, and why I think it will help you:

•  I’ve selected nearly 400 MBE-format questions — none of which appears in
Strategies  &  Tactics  for  the  MBE,  and  the  vast  majority  of  which  are
actual past MBE questions released by the MBE’s drafters.

•    I’ve  put  the  questions  into  a  subtopic-by-subtopic  hierarchy.  So,  for
instance,  within  Contracts,  suppose  you  wanted  to  review  just  questions
dealing with the Parol Evidence Rule. You’d look in the Table of Contents
for the Contracts portion, then the Chapter on Parol Evidence, then the part
called “II. SITUATIONS WHERE PAROL EVIDENCE RULE DOES NOT
APPLY,”  then  the  sub-part  called  “A.  Existence  of  a  condition  on
effectiveness  of  contract.”  In  that  sub-part,  you’d  find  multiple  questions
turning on this sub-issue, i.e., the effect of an oral provision that the writing
won’t  become  effective  until  some  condition  (e.g.,  “My  architect’s
approval”) has been satisfied.

•    Because  I’ve  arranged  the  questions  by  subtopic,  you  can  spot  the  “hot
topics”  on  the  MBE  by  seeing  where  the  questions  are  clustered.  So,  for
instance,  if  you’re  studying  the  Parol  Evidence  Rule,  you  could  see  at  a
glance — by the number of questions devoted to it — that the examiners like
to focus on fact patterns where the Parol Evidence Rule does not apply.

•  I personally wrote and edited the answers to each of these questions.

•  For nearly all answer explanations, I tell you not just why the right choice is
right, but also why each wrong choice is wrong. During my many years of
helping students prepare for the MBE, I’ve learned that the MBE examiners
exploit  a  pool  of  common  student  misconceptions  over  and  over.  So
focusing on why a given wrong choice from a past question is wrong will

42

help you a lot in spotting the examiners’ use of that same trap on your actual
exam.

•    My  discussion  of  each  answer  choice  is  extensively  researched  and
annotated.  When  I  did  this  research,  I  was  often  surprised  to  learn
intricacies  of  law  that  I  hadn’t  been  aware  of  before.  And  one  thing  I  can
promise you based on my review of over 1,000 past MBE questions: when
the  MBE  drafters  write  a  question,  they  look  carefully  at  Restatements,
treatises,  technical  statutory  provisions  (e.g.,  subtleties  of  UCC  Article  2
that  you  probably  never  covered  in  class),  semi-obscure  court  decisions,
and  other  authorities.  The  MBE  is  a  very  technical  exam,  and  to  do  your
best  on  it  you  need  choice-by-choice  analysis  that  focuses  on  the  same
authorities as those the drafters rely on; that’s what I’ve given you here.

•    Some  of  the  questions  are  ones  to  which  the  National  Conference  of  Bar
Examiners (the drafters of the MBE) has released its own “annotations.” But
the  answer  discussions  in  this  book  are  my  own  independently-researched
ones,  and  I  believe  that  my  analysis  is  generally  significantly  more
complete  than  the  ones  released  by  the  National  Conference  of  Bar
Examiners.

All of these questions and answers have been used by hundreds of bar-prep
students in major markets as part of Emanuel Bar Review materials. These
students  then  passed  their  state’s  bar  exam  at  a  rate  ten  percentage  points
higher than the state-wide average.*

Good luck on the MBE. I hope this book helps.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

45

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW Q&A BY TOPIC

All cases cited are U.S. Supreme Court cases unless otherwise noted.

CHAPTER 1
THE SUPREME COURT’S AUTHORITY
AND THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL POWER

I.    THE SUPREME COURT’S AUTHORITY AND

THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL POWER

A.  Supreme Court review of state court decision

1.  “Independent and adequate state grounds”

a.  Violations of state and federal constitutions

i.  How to tell

Question  1:  A  state  constitution  provides  that  in  every
criminal trial “the accused shall have the right to confront all
witnesses  against  him  face  to  face.”  A  defendant  was
convicted  in  state  court  of  child  abuse  based  on  testimony
from  a  six-year-old  child.  The  child  testified  while  she  was
seated behind one-way glass, which allowed the defendant to
see the child but did not allow the child to see the defendant.
The  defendant  appealed  to  the  state  supreme  court  claiming
that the inability of the witness to see the defendant while she
testified  violated  both  the  United  States  Constitution  and  the
state 
federal
constitutional  issue,  the  state  supreme  court  reversed  the
defendant’s  conviction  and  ordered  a  new  trial.  The  state
supreme court held that “the constitution of this state is clear,
and  it  requires  that  while  testifying  in  a  criminal  trial,  a
witness  must  be  able  to  see  the  defendant.”  The  state
petitioned  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  for  a  writ  of

constitution.  Without 

addressing 

the 

46

certiorari.

On  which  ground  should  the  United  States  Supreme  Court
DENY the state’s petition?

(A)  A state may not seek appellate review in the United States
Supreme  Court  of  the  reversal  of  a  criminal  conviction
by its own supreme court.

(B)  The decision of the state supreme court was based on an

adequate and independent state ground.

(C)    The  Sixth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution
does  not  require  that  a  witness  against  a  criminal
defendant be able to see the defendant while the witness
testifies.

(D)  The state supreme court’s decision requires a new trial,

and therefore it is not a final judgment.

Answer 1: Choice (B) is correct. The Supreme Court may not
review  a  judgment  by  the  highest  court  of  a  state  if  that
judgment  is  supported  entirely  by  state  law  and  is  wholly
independent  of  the  interpretation  and  application  of  federal
law.  In  this  case,  although  the  defendant  claimed  a  violation
of  the  Sixth  Amendment  of  the  U.S.  Constitution,  the  state
supreme  court  based  its  decision  entirely  on  the  state
constitution  without  addressing  the  federal  constitutional
issue.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  Supreme  Court  may  review  a
judgment  of  the  highest  court  of  a  state  reversing  a  criminal
conviction,  if  the  state  high  court’s  decision  turns  on  a
question arising under federal law. (But what happened here
was that the state court decision was based entirely on state,
not federal, law.)
(C)  is  wrong  for  two  reasons.  First,  the  Sixth  Amendment
right of a criminal defendant (even in a state-court rather than
federal-court  proceeding)  to  confront  the  witnesses  against
him does usually include the right to view the witness, so this
choice  is  wrong  as  a  matter  of  law.  Second,  the  Supreme
Court would not reach even the merits of the defendant’s Sixth
Amendment claim, for the reason stated in (B) above.
(D) is wrong because, although the Supreme Court may only
review  final  judgments  and  decrees  from  the  highest  state

47

courts,  this  judgment  qualifies  because  it  finally  settled  the
confrontation  issue  (i.e.,  that  issue  would  not  arise  again  on
re-trial,  so  the  present  petition  provided  the  U.S.  Supreme
Court  with  its  only  opportunity  to  review  the  confrontation
issue).

Question  2:  Plaintiff  challenged  the  constitutionality  of  a
state  tax  law,  alleging  that  it  violated  the  Equal  Protection
Clauses  of  both  the  United  States  Constitution  and  the  state
constitution. The state supreme court agreed and held the tax
law  to  be  invalid.  It  said:  “We  hold  that  this  state  tax  law
violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  United  States
Constitution and also the equal protection clause of the state
constitution  because  we  interpret  that  provision  of  the  state
constitution  to  contain  exactly  the  same  prohibition  against
discriminatory  legislation  as  is  contained  in  the  Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution.”

The state sought review of this decision in the United States
Supreme  Court,  alleging  that  the  state  supreme  court’s
issue  was
determination  of 
incorrect.

the  federal  constitutional 

How  should  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  dispose  of  the
case  if  it  believes  that  this  interpretation  of  the  federal
Constitution  by  the  state  supreme  court  raises  an  important
federal question and is incorrect on the merits?

(A)    Reverse  the  state  supreme  court  decision,  because  the
equal  protection  clause  of  a  state  constitution  must  be
construed by the state supreme court in a manner that is
congruent  with  the  meaning  of  the  Equal  Protection
Clause of the federal Constitution.

(B)  Reverse the state supreme court decision with respect to
the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  federal  Constitution
and remand the case to the state supreme court for further
proceedings, because the state and federal constitutional
issues  are  so  intertwined  that  the  federal  issue  must  be
decided so that this case may be disposed of properly.

(C)  Refuse to review the decision of the state supreme court,
because  it  is  based  on  an  adequate  and  independent

48

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

ground of state law.

(D)  Refuse to review the decision of the state supreme court,
because  a  state  government  may  not  seek  review  of
decisions of its own courts in the United States Supreme
Court.

Answer 2: Choice (B) is correct. Although the state supreme
court  made  a  finding  about  what  the  state  constitution
required, this decision was not truly “independent” of federal
constitutional  law,  because  the  facts  make  it  clear  that  the
state court was first determining what the federal Constitution
required,  and  only  then  concluding  that  the  state  constitution
required  the  same  thing.  Therefore,  the  Supreme  Court  can
and  should  correct 
in  federal
constitutional  law.  Once  the  Supreme  Court  has  done  this,  it
should  then  remand  in  order  to  give  the  state  court  the
opportunity to conclude, after further reflection, that the state
constitution’s  ban  on  discriminatory  legislation  goes  further
than the federal ban.

the  state  court’s  error 

Choice  (A)  is  wrong  as  a  pure  matter  of  law:  Even  where
provisions  of  a  state  and  the  federal  Constitution  contain
identical  language,  the  state  court  is  always  free  to  interpret
the state  constitution  as  imposing  different  requirements  than
the apparently-identical federal provision.

Choice  (C)  is  wrong  because,  for  the  reasons  described
above, the state court’s decision was not in fact based on an
adequate and independent state ground.

Choice  (D)  is  wrong  as  a  pure  matter  of  law:  Nothing
prevents  a  state  government  from  seeking  review  of  the
decisions of its own courts in the U.S. Supreme Court, as long
as the decision poses some serious question of federal law.

Question  3:  A  baseball  fan  had  a  fierce  temper  and  an
extremely  loud  voice.  Attending  a  baseball  game  in  which  a
number  of  calls  went  against  the  home  team,  the  fan
repeatedly stood up, brandished his fist, and angrily shouted,
“Kill  the  umpires.”  The  fourth  time  he  engaged  in  this
conduct, many other spectators followed the fan in rising from
their seats, brandishing fists, and shouting, “Kill the umpires.”
The  home  team  lost  the  game.  Although  no  violence  ensued,

49

spectators  crowded  menacingly  around  the  umpires  after  the
game.  As  a  result,  the  umpires  were  able  to  leave  the  field
and stadium only with the help of a massive police escort.

For his conduct, the fan was charged with inciting to riot and
was convicted in a jury trial in state court. He appealed. The
state supreme court reversed his conviction. In its opinion, the
court  discussed  in  detail  decisions  of  the  United  States
Supreme  Court  dealing  with  the  First  Amendment  Free
the  Fourteenth
incorporated 
Speech  Clause  as 
Amendment. At the end of that discussion, however, the court
stated  that  it  “need  not  resolve  how,  on  the  basis  of  these
cases,”  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  would  decide  the
fan’s case. “Instead,” the court stated, “this court has always
given the free-speech guarantee of the state’s constitution the
broadest possible interpretation. As a result, we hold that in
this  case,  where  no  riot  or  other  violence  actually  occurred,
the  state  constitution  does  not  permit  this  conviction  for
incitement to riot to stand.”

into 

The United States Supreme Court grants a writ of certiorari to
review this decision of the state supreme court. In this case,
the United States Supreme Court should
(A)    affirm  the  state  supreme  court’s  decision,  because  the
fan’s  ballpark  shout  is  commonplace  hyperbole  that
cannot,  consistently  with  the  First  and  Fourteenth
Amendments, be punished.

(B)  remand the case to the state supreme court with directions
that it resolve the First and Fourteenth Amendment free-
speech issue that it discussed in such detail.

(C)    dismiss  the  writ  as  improvidently  granted,  because  the
state  supreme  court’s  decision  rests  on  an  independent
and adequate state law ground.

(D)  reverse the decision of the state supreme court, because
incitement  to  violent  action  is  not  speech  protected  by
the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

Answer 3: Choice (C) is correct, because the decision for the
fan was reached entirely on state grounds. The Supreme Court
may hear a case from a state only if the state court judgment
turned on federal grounds. The Court must refuse jurisdiction

50

if  it  finds  adequate  and  independent  non-federal  grounds  to
support the state decision. To be “adequate,” the non-federal
grounds  must  be  fully  dispositive  of  the  case.  To  be
“independent,”  the  state  court’s  interpretation  of  the  state
provision  must  be  based  on  the  court’s  own  reasoning  about
state  law,  not  based  in  whole  or  part  on  the  state  court’s
conclusion about what federal law provides.

Here, the state grounds mentioned by the state supreme court
were “adequate” to support the decision, because that court’s
decision was based entirely on its own practice of giving the
broadest  possible  interpretation  to  the  state  constitution’s
free-speech guarantee. The state grounds were “independent”
because,  although  the  state  court  discussed  in  detail  the
Supreme Court’s First and Fourteenth Amendment decisions,
the  state  court  specifically  stated  that  its  determination  was
independent  of  how  the  Supreme  Court  would  decide  the
federal  constitutionality  of  the  statute.  Because  there  were
both  adequate  and  independent  state  grounds,  the  Court  can
and  should  dismiss  the  writ  of  certiorari  as  improvidently
granted.

(A) is wrong because it is an incorrect statement of the law.
First,  the  Court  may  not  hear  the  case  at  all,  for  the  reason
given  in  the  discussion  of  choice  C  above.  But  even  if  the
Court did hear the case, choice A would not explain what the
Court should do. One of the categories of speech unprotected
by the First Amendment is “fighting words” — that is, words
that  are  likely  to  induce  the  person  to  whom  they  are
addressed  to  commit  an  immediate  act  of  violence.  (To
constitute “fighting words” it is not enough that the speaker’s
words  make  the  listeners  angry;  an  incitement  to  immediate
violence  is  required.)  The  fan’s  ballpark  shout  could
constitutionally  be  punished  under  this  “fighting  words”
doctrine,  because  it  tended  to  incite  the  other  spectators  to
violence.
(B) is wrong because the state court’s decision was reached
on independent state grounds. The Court may not hear the case
due  to  the  presence  of  an  independent  and  adequate  state
ground,  as  described  in  the  discussion  of  choice  C  above.
Therefore,  the  Court  does  not  have  jurisdiction  to  issue  a

51

“remand” (which is itself an exercise of federal jurisdiction,
and thus inappropriate here).

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  Court  does  not  have  jurisdiction.
The  Court  may  not  hear  the  case  due  to  the  presence  of  an
independent  and  adequate  state  ground,  as  described  in  the
discussion of choice C above. Therefore, the Court does not
have  jurisdiction  to  reverse  the  state  court  decision.  (If  the
Court did have jurisdiction, because the state court had rested
its  decision  partly  or  fully  on  federal-constitutional  grounds,
then  choice  D  would  be  a  correct  statement  of  what  the
Supreme Court should do, since incitement to violent action is
not protected speech, under the “fighting words” doctrine.)

B.  Supreme Court’s jurisdiction

Question 4: A federal statute provides that the United States
Supreme  Court  has  authority  to  review  any  case  filed  in  a
United States court of appeals, even though that case has not
yet been decided by the court of appeals.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an agency in the
executive  branch  of  the  federal  government,  issued  an
important  environmental  rule.  Although  the  rule  had  not  yet
been  enforced  against  them,  companies  that  would  be
adversely  affected  by  the  rule  filed  a  petition  for  review  of
the  rule  in  a  court  of  appeals,  seeking  a  declaration  that  the
rule  was  invalid  solely  because  it  was  beyond  the  statutory
authority  of  the  EPA.  The  companies  made  no  constitutional
claim.  A  statute  specifically  provides  for  direct  review  of
EPA rules by a court of appeals without any initial action in a
district court.

The companies have filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in
the Supreme Court requesting immediate review of this case
by the Supreme Court before the court of appeals has actually
decided  the  case.  The  EPA  acknowledges  that  the  case  is
important enough to warrant Supreme Court review and that it
should be decided promptly, but it asks the Supreme Court to
dismiss the petition on jurisdictional grounds.
The  best  constitutional  argument  in  support  of  the  EPA’s
request is that
(A)    the  case  is  not  within  the  original  jurisdiction  of  the

52

Supreme Court as defined by Article III, and it is not a
proper  subject  of  that  court’s  appellate  jurisdiction
because it has not yet been decided by any lower court.

(B)    the  case  is  appellate  in  nature,  but  it  is  beyond  the
appellate  jurisdiction  of  the  Supreme  Court,  because
Article  III  states  that  its  jurisdiction  extends  only  to
cases arising under the Constitution.

(C)    Article  III  precludes  federal  courts  from  reviewing  the
validity  of  any  federal  agency  rule  in  any  proceeding
other than an action to enforce the rule.

(D)    Article  III  provides  that  all  federal  cases,  except  those
within  the  original  jurisdiction  of  the  Supreme  Court,
must be initiated by an action in a federal district court.

the  Court’s  original  nor  appellate 

Answer 4: Choice (A) is correct, because no lower court has
yet  reached  a  decision  in  the  case.  The  best  argument  in
support  of  the  EPA’s  request  that  the  Supreme  Court  dismiss
the petition on jurisdictional grounds is that the case is within
neither 
jurisdiction.
Original  jurisdiction:  Under  Article  III,  §  2,  the  Supreme
Court  has  original  jurisdiction  in  (and  only  in)  all  cases
affecting  ambassadors,  other  public  ministers  and  counsels,
and those in which a state shall be a party. The case here does
not  involve  any  of  those  categories,  so  original  jurisdiction
does not exist.

Appellate jurisdiction: Article III, § 2, also provides that in
those  cases  arising  under  the  Constitution,  by  an  Act  of
Congress,  or  by  treaty,  the  Supreme  Court  shall  have
appellate  jurisdiction.  It’s  true  that,  as  the  facts  tell  us,  a
federal  statute  gives  the  Supreme  Court  the  authority  to
review any case filed in a U.S. court of appeals, even though
that case has not yet been decided by the court of appeals. But
that  statute  presumes  a  decision  by  a  lower  court,  which
hasn’t  yet  happened  in  this  case.  Indeed,  for  the  Supreme
Court  to  hear  this  case,  in  the  absence  of  any  lower-court
decision, would not be an exercise of “appellate” jurisdiction
at all — there is no decision being appealed from.
(B) is wrong because the answer is an inaccurate statement of
what  Article  III  provides.  Article  III,  §  2,  provides  that  in
addition to cases arising under the Constitution, the Supreme

53

Court  shall  have  appellate  jurisdiction  in  cases  arising
relating  to  an  act  of  Congress  or  a  treaty.  So  insofar  as  this
choice  says  that  the  Supreme  Court’s  appellate  jurisdiction
extends “only” to cases “arising under the Constitution” (and
implies that there is no jurisdiction over cases arising under
federal statutes), it’s flatly wrong.

(C) is wrong because the answer is an inaccurate statement of
the  law.  Article  III,  §  2,  limits  federal  court  jurisdiction  to
“cases” and “controversies” and so the federal courts may not
issue “advisory opinions” (i.e., opinions giving advice about
particular  legislative  or  executive  action,  when  no  party  is
before  the  court  who  has  suffered  or  imminently  faces
specific 
issue
declaratory  judgments,  where  the  court  is  not  requested  to
award  damages  or  an  injunction,  but  rather  is  requested  to
state  what  the  legal  effect  would  be  of  proposed  conduct  by
one of the parties. Because an action for declaratory judgment
would be within federal courts’ Article III power, yet such an
action would not be an “action to enforce the rule,” choice C
is wrong.

injury).  Federal  courts  can,  however, 

(D) is wrong because the answer is an inaccurate statement of
the  law.  This  choice  states  that  all  federal  cases  not  falling
within  the  Supreme  Court’s  original  jurisdiction  must  be
“initiated  by  an  action  in  federal  district  court.”  This  is
simply an untrue statement. For example, the Court may hear a
case  originally  filed  with  and  heard  by  a  U.S.  court  of
appeals, if Congress authorizes this arrangement.

II.   CONGRESS’S CONTROL OF FEDERAL

JUDICIAL POWER

A.  Congress’s power to decide

1.  Limits by Congress

Question 5: Assume that Congress passed and the President
signed the following statute:
“The  appellate  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  Supreme
Court  shall  not  extend 
the
constitutionality of any state statute limiting the circumstances

to  any  case 

involving 

54

in  which  a  woman  may  obtain  an  abortion,  or  involving  the
constitutionality of this statute.”

The  strongest  argument  against  the  constitutionality  of  this
statute is that

(A)  Congress may not exercise its authority over the appellate
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in a way that seriously
interferes  with  the  establishment  of  a  supreme  and
uniform body of federal constitutional law.

(B)  Congress may only regulate the appellate jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court over cases initially arising in federal
courts.

(C)  the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court may only

be altered by constitutional amendment.

(D)    the  statute  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the

Fourteenth Amendment.

Answer  5:  The  correct  choice  is  (A).  In  cases  not  falling
within  the  Supreme  Court’s  original  jurisdiction  (e.g.,  cases
in which a state is a party), the Supreme Court has “appellate
Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions,
and  under  such  Regulations  as  the  Congress  shall  make.”
(Article  III,  Sec.  2,  Cl.  2.)  So  Congress,  acting  under  this
clause,  has  the  power  to  regulate  (including  limit)  the
appellate  jurisdiction  of  the  Supreme  Court.  However,  the
Court  held  in  U.S.  v.  Klein  that  Congress  cannot  use  this
power to specify jurisdiction as a “mean to an end” to make a
particular  substantive  question  come  out  a  certain  way.
Choice  (A)  best  captures  this  limitation,  by  suggesting  that
Congress  was  attempting  to  freeze  then-current  abortion  law
and  to  prevent  a  future  Supreme  Court  from  developing
constitutional  law  in  this  area  as  the  Court  sees  fit.  This
argument  might  not  succeed,  but  it  is  the  only  choice  that
could even theoretically work.
(B)  is  simply  wrong — Congress  can  under  Article  III,  Sec.
2,  Cl.  2  regulate  the  appellate  jurisdiction  of  the  Supreme
Court  whether  the  case  originally  arose  in  federal  court  or
state court (and the only significance of where the case arose
is  that  in  those  rare  cases  falling  within  the  original
jurisdiction  of  the  Supreme  Court  itself,  no  “appellate

55

jurisdiction”  is  necessary,  so  that  there  is  no  appellate
jurisdiction which Congress might limit.)

(C)  is  also  simply  wrong — as  discussed  in  (A)  above,
Article  III,  Sec.  2,  Cl.  2  lets  Congress,  acting  without  a
constitutional amendment, change the appellate jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  Equal
Protection  Clause  protects  only  against  classifications  made
by state governments, and if there is any classification being
made  here  (doubtful),  it  is  being  made  by  Congress,  not  a
state.

Question 6: Which of the following acts by the United States
Senate would be constitutionally IMPROPER?

(A)  The Senate decides, with the House of Representatives,
that  a  disputed  state  ratification  of  a  proposed
constitutional amendment is valid.

(B)  The Senate determines the eligibility of a person to serve

as a senator.

(C)  The Senate appoints a commission to adjudicate finally a

boundary dispute between two states.

(D)  The Senate passes a resolution calling on the President to

pursue a certain foreign policy.

Answer 6: Choice (C) is correct. Art. III, Sec. 2, says that the
federal judicial power extends “to controversies between two
or more States.” Art. III, Sec. 3 then says that “in all cases . . .
in which a State shall be a Party, the supreme Court shall have
original jurisdiction.” That same article says that the Supreme
jurisdiction”  shall  be  “with  such
Court’s  “appellate 
exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall
make.”  There  is  no  similar  provision  allowing  Congress  to
make exceptions to (i.e., restrictions on) the Supreme Court’s
original  jurisdiction,  so  Congress  can’t  restrict  the  Supreme
Court’s  original  jurisdiction.  Since  a  boundary  dispute
between two states is a dispute in which “a State shall be a
Party,” since the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over
cases involving a party, and since Congress is not authorized
to  limit  the  Supreme  Court’s  original  jurisdiction,  it  follows
that  Congress  cannot  “adjudicate  finally”  (i.e.,  remove  the

56

Supreme Court’s right to adjudicate) the boundary dispute.

Choice  (A)  is  wrong  because,  under  Coleman  v.  Miller
(1939),  the  House  and  Senate  together  do  have  the  right
(indeed, the exclusive right) to determine whether a disputed
state ratification of an amendment is valid.

Choice  (B)  is  incorrect  because  the  Senate  does  have  the
power  to  determine  the  eligibility  of  its  members — Art.  I,
Sec. 5, Cl. 1 says that “each House shall be the judge of the
Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members.”

Choice  (D)  is  wrong  because  Art.  I,  Sec.  7,  Cl.  3  says  that
“Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence
of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary
. . . shall be presented to the President of the United States[.]”
This  clause  implicitly  gives  each  House  the  power  to  adopt
resolutions;  a  resolution  will  not  become  law  unless  signed
by  the  President,  but  the  clause  means  that  either  House’s
adoption of a resolution is proper.

57

CHAPTER 2
POWERS OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT; THE SEPARATION OF
POWERS

I.    POWERS OF THE THREE FEDERAL

BRANCHES

A.  Powers of the three branches

1.  Congress

a.  Federal property

Question 7:  The  National  Ecological  Balance  Act  prohibits
the  destruction  or  removal  of  any  wild  animals  located  on
lands owned by the United States without express permission
from the Federal Bureau of Land Management. Violators are
subject to fines of up to $1,000 per offense.

After  substantial  property  damage  was  inflicted  on  residents
of  a  state  by  hungry  coyotes,  the  state  legislature  passed  the
Coyote Bounty Bill, which offers $25 for each coyote killed
or captured within the state. A National Forest, owned by the
federal government, is located entirely within that state. Many
coyotes live in the National Forest.

Without  seeking  permission  from  the  Bureau  of  Land
Management,  a  hunter  shot  several  coyotes  in  the  National
Forest and collected the bounty from the state. As a result, he
was  subsequently  tried  in  federal  district  court,  convicted,
and  fined  $1,000  for  violating  the  National  Ecological
Balance Act. The hunter appealed his conviction to the United
States court of appeals.

On  appeal,  the  court  of  appeals  should  hold  the  National
Ecological Balance Act, as applied to the hunter, to be
(A)  constitutional, because the Property Clause of Article IV,
Section  3,  of  the  Constitution  authorizes  such  federal
statutory controls and sanctions.

(B)    constitutional,  because  Article  I,  Section  8,  of  the

58

Constitution  authorizes  Congress  to  enact  all  laws
necessary and proper to advance the general welfare.
(C)    unconstitutional,  because  Congress  may  not  use  its
delegated powers to override the Tenth Amendment right
of  the  state  to  legislate  in  areas  of  traditional  state
governmental  functions,  such  as  the  protection  of  the
property of its residents.

(D)  unconstitutional, because Congress violates the Full Faith
and Credit Clause of Article IV when it punishes conduct
that has been authorized by state action.

Answer 7: Choice (A) is correct. Art. IV, Sec. 3, Cl. 2 gives
Congress  the  power  to  “make  all  needful  Rules  and
Regulations  respecting 
the  Territory  or  other  Property
belonging to the United States[.]” Since the National Forest is
federally-owned  property,  this  clause  gives  Congress  the
power to pass regulations governing it. Under the Supremacy
Clause,  those  regulations  would  take  precedence  over  any
conflicting  state  regulations,  such  as  the  right  to  kill  coyotes
implied by the state bounty bill.
(B) is wrong because it suggests that there is an independent
congressional power to act to advance “the general welfare.”
This is not so — there’s a power to “tax  and  spend  .  .  .  for
the  general  welfare,”  but  that’s  not  what’s  at  issue  here
(because  Congress  is  doing  pure  regulating,  not  taxing  or
spending).

(C) is wrong because if Congress has been given an explicit
power  in  a  certain  area  (here,  the  power  to  regulate  on
federal  lands),  Congress  can  indeed  override  whatever  right
the  state  might  otherwise  have  to  legislate  in  areas  of
traditional state governmental functions.
(D)  is  wrong  because  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause  does
not  block  Congress  from  punishing  conduct  that  has  been
authorized by a state; the Clause merely requires one state to
enforce every other state’s judgments.

2.  President

a.  CEO of the U.S., and “Executive Orders”

i.  Direction to private party

59

Question  8:  The  President  issued  an  executive  order  in  an
effort to encourage citizens to use the metric (Celsius) system
of  temperatures.  Sec.  1  of  the  executive  order  requires  the
United States Weather Bureau, a federal executive agency, to
state temperatures only in Celsius in all weather reports. Sec.
2  of  the  executive  order  requires  all  privately  owned
federally  licensed  radio  and  television  stations  giving
weather  reports  to  report  temperatures  only  in  Celsius.  No
federal statute is applicable.

Is the President’s executive order constitutional?

(A)  Sec. 1 is constitutional, but Sec. 2 is not.
(B)  Sec. 2 is constitutional, but Sec. 1 is not.
(C)  Sections 1 and 2 are constitutional.
(D)  Sections 1 and 2 are unconstitutional.
Answer  8:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Sec.  1  of  the  executive
order  is  constitutional,  because  the  President,  as  the  chief
executive  officer  of  the  U.S.  government,  has  authority  to
direct the actions of federal executive agencies, so long as the
President’s  directives  are  not  inconsistent  with  an  act  of
Congress.  (The  facts  state  that  there  is  no  applicable  statute
here.)  Sec.  2  of  the  executive  order  is  unconstitutional.  At
least as a general rule, the President does not have authority
to  direct  the  actions  of  persons  outside  the  executive  branch
unless  the  President’s  direction  is  authorized  by  an  act  of
Congress.  There  are  no  circumstances  presented  in  the  facts
(such  as  a  sudden  attack  on  the  U.S.)  that  might  justify  an
exception to this general rule.

(B), (C), and (D) are wrong because each is inconsistent with
the above analysis.

b.  Pardons

Question 9: Congress passed a bill prohibiting the President
from  granting  a  pardon  to  any  person  who  had  not  served  at
least  one-third  of  the  sentence  imposed  by  the  court  which
convicted that person. The President vetoed the bill, claiming
that it was unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Congress passed it
over his veto by a two-thirds vote of each House.

This act of Congress is

60

(A) 

it  was  enacted  over 
  constitutional,  because 
President’s veto by a two-thirds vote of each House.
(B)  constitutional, because it is a necessary and proper means

the

of carrying out the powers of Congress.

(C)    unconstitutional,  because  it  interferes  with  the  plenary

power of the President to grant pardons.

is 

(D)  unconstitutional, because a Presidential veto based upon
constitutional  grounds  may  be  overridden  only  with  the
concurrence of three-fourths of the state legislatures.
Answer 9: The correct choice is (C). The President’s pardon
power 
indeed  plenary.  Therefore,  when  Congress
purported to place conditions on that power, those conditions
were ineffective. For the same reason, Choices (A), (B), and
(D)  are  wrong.  (By  the  way,  Choice  (D)  is  also  grossly
incorrect  as  a  statement  of  the  law  of  vetoes:  Where  the
President vetoes a bill passed by Congress, Article I, Sec. 7,
Cl.  2  says  that  the  veto  can  be  overwritten  by  a  two-thirds
vote  of  both  Houses.  There  is  no  procedure  by  which  the
concurrence of three-fourths of state legislatures can act as an
overriding method.)

II.   THE FEDERAL COMMERCE POWER

A.  Summary of modern view

1.  “Substantially affecting” commerce

a.  Activity is commercial

Question 10: A federal statute prohibits the sale or resale, in
any  place  in  this  country,  of  any  product  intended  for  human
consumption  or  ingestion  into  the  human  body  that  contains
designated  chemicals  known  to  cause  cancer,  unless  the
product is clearly labeled as dangerous.
The constitutionality of this federal statute may most easily be
justified on the basis of the power of Congress to
(A)  regulate commerce among the states.
(B)  enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.
(C)  provide for the general welfare.
(D)  promote science and the useful arts.

61

Answer  10:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  key  point  is  that
Congress  can  use  its  commerce  powers  to  regulate  even
entirely  intrastate  transactions,  on  the  theory  that  such
transactions  are  being  regulated  as  part  of  a  broader
regulation  of  interstate  transactions,  and  excluding  purely
intrastate  transactions  from  the  overall  scheme  would  be
unwieldy.  So,  for  instance,  Congress  here  can  forbid  a
farmer’s  sale,  at  a  roadside  stand  adjacent  to  his  farm,  of  a
tomato that he had raised, where the farmer sprayed a cancer-
causing  substance  produced  inside  that  same  state  onto  the
tomato — even though this is an entirely intrastate transaction,
it  is  still  a  “commercial”  transaction,  and  can  be  regulated
pursuant 
interstate-commerce
regulatory scheme.

to  Congress’s 

broader 

(B)  is  wrong  for  several  reasons;  most  importantly,  the
Fourteenth Amendment protects only against various conduct
(e.g., denials of equal protection and due process) involving
“state action,” and while Congress has the power to enforce
that Amendment by appropriate legislation, Congress here is
not focused on attempting to prohibit any state from violating
the Amendment.

(C) is wrong because there is no general congressional power
to “provide for the general welfare”; there is only a power to
tax and spend for the general welfare.

(D)  is  similarly  incorrect  because  there  is  no  general
congressional power to “promote science and the useful arts”;
there  is  only  the  limited  power  in  Art.  I,  Sec.  8,  Cl.  8  to
“promote  the  progress  of  science  and  useful  arts”  by
“securing  for  limited  times  to  authors  and  inventors  the
exclusive  right  to  their  respective  writings  and  discoveries”
(i.e., the power to issue patents and copyrights).

Question 11: “Look-alike drugs” is the term used to describe
nonprescription  drugs  that  look  like  narcotic  drugs  and  are
sold on the streets as narcotic drugs. After extensive hearings,
Congress  concluded  that  the  sale  of  look-alike  drugs  was
widespread in this country and was creating severe health and
law  enforcement  problems.  To  combat  these  problems,
Congress  enacted  a  comprehensive  statute  that  regulates  the
manufacture,  distribution,  and  sale  of  all  nonprescription

62

drugs in the United States.

Which of the following sources of constitutional authority can
most  easily  be  used  to  justify  the  authority  of  Congress  to
enact this statute?

(A)  The spending power.
(B)  The Commerce Clause.
(C)  The general welfare clause.
(D)  The enforcement powers of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Answer 11: Choice (B) is correct. All of the activities being
regulated by Congress here — manufacturing, distribution and
sale  of  drugs — pertain  to  commerce.  Therefore,  Congress’s
power to regulate commerce is an ample source of authority
for  the  regulatory  scheme  here.  That  is  true  even  though  the
overall objectives being sought by Congress — the protection
of health and the enforcement of law at the local level — are
arguably “local” concerns traditionally left to the states.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  congressional  statute  here  is
essentially  regulatory,  and  does  not  involve  significant
spending of federal funds.

(C) is wrong because there is no “general welfare” clause in
the  sense  of  a  freestanding  congressional  power  to  legislate
for the general welfare; there is, instead, only the power to tax
and spend to achieve the general welfare, and Congress is not
doing meaningful taxing or spending in the regulation at issue
here.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  protects
only against various conduct (e.g., denials of equal protection
and  due  process)  involving  “state  action,”  and  while
Congress  has  the  power  to  enforce  that  Amendment  by
appropriate  legislation,  Congress  here  is  not  focused  on
attempting  to  prohibit  states  from  violating  the  Amendment;
for  instance,  there  is  no  indication  that  Congress  is  trying  to
prevent  the  states  from  discriminating  in  the  sale  of
nonprescription drugs or from denying anyone due process as
to such drugs.

legislation
Question  12:  Congress  wishes 
prohibiting discrimination in the sale or rental of housing on

to  enact 

63

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

the basis of the affectional preference or sexual orientation of
the potential purchaser or renter. Congress wishes this statute
to  apply  to  all  public  and  private  vendors  and  lessors  of
residential  property  in  this  country,  with  a  few  narrowly
drawn exceptions.

The  most  credible  argument  for  congressional  authority  to
enact such a statute would be based upon the

(A)    general  welfare  clause  of  Article  I,  Section  8,  because
the  conduct  the  statute  prohibits  could  reasonably  be
deemed to be harmful to the national interest.

(B)    Commerce  Clause  of  Article  I,  Section  8,  because,  in
inseverable  aggregates,  the  sale  or  rental  of  almost  all
housing  in  this  country  could  reasonably  be  deemed  to
have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

(C)  enforcement clause of the Thirteenth Amendment, because
that Amendment clearly prohibits discrimination against
the class of persons protected by this statute.

(D)    enforcement  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,
because that Amendment prohibits all public and private
actors from engaging in irrational discrimination.

Answer 12:  Choice  (B)  is  correct,  because  the  “substantial
effect  on  commerce”  rationale  has  been  accepted  by  the
Supreme  Court.  For  instance,  in  Wickard  v.  Filburn  (1942),
the  Court  held  that  Congress  could  regulate  even  the
consumption  of  wheat  on  the  farm  where  it  was  produced,
because  such  intrastate  uses,  when  aggregated,  had  a
substantial effect on interstate commerce. The same principle
would apply here: (1) the rental or sale of property is clearly
“commercial”;  and  (2)  even  a  local  (“intrastate”)  sale  or
rental of property would indirectly affect interstate commerce
(e.g.,  by  substantially  affecting  the  demand  for  housing-
construction materials from out of state).
Note  that  this  question  does  not  raise  the  same  commerce
problem as N.F.I.B. v. Sebelius (2012), where the Court said
that  the  commerce  power  doesn’t  allow  Congress  to  require
someone who is not presently in the market for an interstate
good or service to buy or sell such a good or service. Here,
the  statute  implicitly  applies  only  to  one  who  is  already

64

proposing to rent or sell housing property, and all the statute
does  is  to  prevent  the  seller  or  landlord  from  engaging  in
certain types of discrimination in choosing the other party. But
suppose  Congress  instead  passed  a  statute  saying,  “Anyone
who  has  a  vacant  housing  unit  that  is  suitable  for  habitation
must  make  good  faith  efforts  to  rent  it  to  the  first  financially
qualified  applicant  for  no  more  than  $x  per  square  foot  per
year.” This statute would run afoul of N.F.I.B. (i.e., would be
beyond  Congress’s  commerce  powers),  because  Congress
would be forcing someone not already in the “be a landlord”
market to enter that market.

(A) is wrong, because Congress has no power to regulate for
the general welfare. Article I § 8 gives Congress the power to
“tax and spend” for the general welfare, but that’s not what’s
happening here — what’s happening here is pure regulation.

(C)  is  wrong,  because  the  Thirteenth  Amendment  almost
certainly cannot be used to protect against sexual-orientation
discrimination. The Thirteenth Amendment expressly protects
against slavery. Its enforcement clause has been interpreted to
allow  Congress  to  legislate  against  the  “badges  of  slavery,”
and  to  prohibit  even  private  actors  from  practicing  racial
discrimination. The Court has never held that the Amendment
may  be  used  outside  of  the  racial  area.  It’s  possible  (though
not  certain)  that  Congress  could  rely  on  the  Amendment  to
prohibit  private  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  ethnicity  and
national origin in addition to race, since these are similar to
racial  discrimination.  But 
the
Amendment  can  be  used  to  bar  private  discrimination  on
grounds so distinct from slavery as sexual orientation.

it’s  very  unlikely 

that 

(D) is wrong, because it is a misstatement of law. The Equal
Protection  Clause  of 
the  Fourteenth  Amendment  bars
discrimination only when there is state action. When a purely
private actor practices discrimination, Congress’s Fourteenth
Amendment § 5 remedial powers do not permit it to prohibit
that  discrimination.  So,  although  Congress  could  probably
rely  on  its  §  5  powers  to  prohibit  public  entities  (states  and
cities, for instance) from discriminating on grounds of sexual
orientation, if there was evidence such entities had frequently
committed such discrimination in the past, Congress cannot do

65

so  with  respect  to  purely  private  discrimination.  See,  e.g.,
U.S.  v.  Morrison  (2000)  (Congress  can’t  use  its  Fourteenth
Amendment  §  5  powers  to  let  victims  of  gender-motivated
violent crimes sue in federal court).

B.  The Tenth Amendment as a limit on Congress’s power

Question 13:  A  federal  law  provides  that  all  motor  vehicle
tires  discarded  in  this  country  must  be  disposed  of  in
facilities  licensed  by  the  federal  Environmental  Protection
Agency.  Pursuant  to  this  federal  law  and  all  proper  federal
procedural  requirements,  that  agency  has  adopted  very  strict
standards for the licensing of such facilities. As a result, the
cost of disposing of tires in licensed facilities is substantial.
The  state  of  East  Dakota  has  a  very  large  fleet  of  motor
vehicles,  including  trucks  used  to  support  state-owned
commercial activities and police cars. East Dakota disposes
of  used  tires  from  both  kinds  of  state  motor  vehicles  in  a
state-owned  and  -operated  facility.  This  state  facility  is
unlicensed, but its operation in actual practice meets most of
the  standards 
federal  Environmental
Protection Agency on facilities it licenses to dispose of tires.

imposed  by 

the 

Consistent with United States Supreme Court precedent, may
the state of East Dakota continue to dispose of its used tires in
this manner?

(A)  No, because a state must comply with valid federal laws
that regulate matters affecting interstate commerce.
(B)  No, because some of the tires come from vehicles that are
used by the state solely in its commercial activities.
(C)    Yes,  because  some  of  the  tires  come  from  vehicles  that
are  used  by  the  state  in  the  performance  of  core  state
governmental functions such as law enforcement.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  legitimate  needs  of  the  federal
government  are  satisfied  by  the  fact  that  the  unlicensed
state disposal scheme meets, in actual practice, most of
the federal standards for the licensing of such facilities.

Answer 13:  The  correct  choice  is  (A).  The  federal  law  on
tire  disposal  was  a  proper  exercise  of  Congress’s  power  to
regulate interstate commerce, so the law was validly enacted.
The  fact  that  Congress  has  chosen  to  regulate  the  actions  of

66

state governments does not prevent an otherwise-valid statute
from being constitutional. There is one major exception — the
Tenth Amendment prevents Congress from “commandeer[ing]
the legislative processes of the states” by directly compelling
states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program [New
York  v.  U.S.]  But  here,  although  Congress  is  regulating  the
states,  it  is  not  forcing  the  states  to  enact  or  enforce  any
federal regulatory program (merely forcing the states to obey
the federal program in the state’s own internal operations), so
the exception does not apply.

Choice (B) is wrong because, although it reaches the correct
conclusion, it does so for the wrong reasons; even if none of
the tires came from vehicles used by the state in commercial
activities, the federal regulation would still be valid.

Choice (C) is wrong because Congress has power to regulate
interstate commerce in a way that binds the states, and there is
no  exception  to  this  power  for  regulation  of  “core  state
if
governmental  functions”  (although  as  noted  above, 
Congress were actually ordering the state to enact or enforce
a  regulatory  program,  this  would  be  beyond  Congress’s
commerce powers).
Choice (D) is wrong because the fact that the unlicensed state
disposal  facility  meets  most  federal  standards  is  irrelevant;
Congress has the power to insist that the state strictly obey the
federal  requirement  that  only  licensed  disposal  facilities  be
used.

1.  Not a source of state authority

Question  14:  Widgets  are  manufactured  wholly  from  raw
materials mined and processed in the state of Green. The only
two  manufacturers  of  widgets  in  the  United  States  are  also
located in that state. However, their widgets are purchased by
retailers located in every state. The legislature of the state of
Green  is  considering  the  adoption  of  a  statute  that  would
impose a tax solely on the manufacture of widgets. The tax is
to be calculated at 3% of their wholesale value.
Which of the following arguments would be LEAST helpful to
the  state  in  defending  the  constitutionality  of  this  proposed
state tax on widgets?

67

(A)  At the time widgets are manufactured and taxed they have
not yet entered the channels of interstate commerce.
(B)  The economic impact of this tax will be passed on to both
in-state  and  out-of-state  purchasers  of  widgets  and,
therefore, it is wholly nondiscriminatory in its effect.
(C)    Because  of  the  powers  reserved  to  them  by  the  Tenth
Amendment,  states  have  plenary  authority  to  construct
their tax system in any manner they choose.

(D)  A tax on the manufacture of widgets may be imposed only
by  the  state  in  which  the  manufacturing  occurs  and,
therefore,  it  is  not  likely  to  create  the  danger  of  a
multiple tax burden on interstate commerce.

Answer 14:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  If  this  tax  scheme  has  a
problem, the problem is likely to have to do with the fact that
Green  is  imposing  a  tax  on  widgets  that  are  shipped
throughout  the  U.S.,  and  that  tax  may  be  a  burden  on
commerce. The Tenth Amendment does not solve this problem
for  Green — if  Green  is  unduly  burdening  commerce,  the
Tenth Amendment won’t save it. And it’s certainly inaccurate
to say that the states “have plenary authority to construct their
tax  system  in  any  manner  they  choose” — for  instance,  if  a
state intentionally designs its tax system so as to put most of
the  burden  on  out-of-staters  who  derive  some  revenue  from
customers  in  the  state  and  who  don’t  vote  in  state  elections,
the  scheme  would  clearly  violate  the  dormant  commerce
clause.

(A),  (B),  and  (D)  each  arguably  helps  the  state  rebut  the
plaintiff’s  argument  that  the  tax  is  an  undue  burden  on
commerce  and  that  it  thus  violates  the  dormant  commerce
clause.  Therefore,  each  of  these  arguments  might  help  the
state.

III.  THE TAXING AND SPENDING POWERS

A.  Taxing power

1.  Regulation

a.  Adverse economic consequences no problem

Question 

15:  The  Sports  Championship  Revenue

68

Enhancement Act is a federal statute that was enacted as part
of  a  comprehensive  program  to  eliminate  the  federal  budget
deficit.  That  act  imposed,  for  a  period  of  five  years,  a  50%
excise  tax  on  the  price  of  tickets  to  championship  sporting
events.  Such  events  included  the  World  Series,  the  Super
Bowl, major college bowl games, and similar championship
sports events.

This federal tax is probably

(A)  constitutional, because the compelling national interest in
reducing the federal budget deficit justifies this tax as a
temporary emergency measure.

(B)  constitutional, because an act of Congress that appears to
be a revenue raising measure on its face is not rendered
it  may  have  adverse  economic
invalid  because 
consequences for the activity taxed.

(C)    unconstitutional,  because  a  50%  tax  is  likely  to  reduce
attendance  at  championship  sporting  events  and,
therefore,  is  not  rationally  related  to  the  legitimate
interest of Congress in eliminating the budget deficit.
(D)    unconstitutional,  because  Congress  violates  the  equal
protection component of the Fifth Amendment by singling
out  championship  sporting  events  for  this  tax  while
tax  other  major  sporting,  artistic,  or
failing 
entertainment events to which tickets are sold.

to 

Answer  15:  Choice  (B)  is  correct;  a  federal  tax  that  will
raise revenue is not rendered invalid by virtue of the fact that
it  has  regulatory  consequences,  including  a  lessening  of
demand  for  the  product  or  activity  being  taxed.  (That’s  true,
by the way, whether or not Congress intended that lessening of
demand.)

(A) is incorrect because the tax would be valid as a revenue-
raising measure even in the absence of a compelling national
interest.
(C)  is  incorrect  for  the  same  reason  that  Choice  (B)  is
correct — as long as the tax is on its face a revenue-raiser, it
does  not  even  have  to  be  rationally  related  to  some  broader
federal interest like deficit-reduction (and in any event the tax
probably is rationally related to deficit-reduction even though

69

sporting attendance may go down — the rational-relation test
is very easy to satisfy, and you should beware of any choice
that  requires  you  to  conclude  that  a  means  chosen  by
to  a  particular
government 
governmental goal).

rationally 

is  not 

related 

(D)  is  incorrect  because  where,  as  here,  a  legislative
classification involves economics and does not implicate any
suspect  class  or  fundamental  right,  equal  protection  is
satisfied  as  long  as  the  classification  is  rationally  related  to
the  achievement  of  some  legitimate  governmental  objective;
here,  the  objective  is  revenue-raising,  and  the  fact  that  other
similar  activities  are  spared  the  tax  does  not  prevent  the  tax
from being rationally-related to that objective.

b.  No relation needed between activity taxed and how funds

are spent

Question 16: In order to provide funds for a system of new
major airports near the ten largest cities in the United States,
Congress levies a tax of $25 on each airline ticket issued in
the United States. The tax applies to every airline ticket, even
those for travel that does not originate in, terminate at, or pass
through any of those ten large cities.

As  applied  to  the  issuance  in  the  United  States  of  an  airline
ticket for travel between two cities that will not be served by
any of the new airports, this tax is

(A)  constitutional, because Congress has broad discretion in
choosing  the  subjects  of  its  taxation  and  may  impose
taxes on subjects that have no relation to the purpose for
which those tax funds will be expended.

(B)    constitutional,  because  an  exemption  for  the  issuance  of
tickets  for  travel  between  cities  that  will  not  be  served
by  the  new  airports  would  deny  the  purchasers  of  all
other tickets the equal protection of the laws.

(C)  unconstitutional, because the burden of the tax outweighs
its  benefits  for  passengers  whose  travel  does  not
originate in, terminate at, or pass through any of the ten
largest cities.

(D)    unconstitutional,  because  the  tax  adversely  affects  the

fundamental right to travel.

70

Answer  16:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  This  choice  accurately
restates the fundamental rule about Congress’s power to tax:
As long as Congress can rationally be said to be pursuing the
general  welfare  (not  a  meaningful  constraint),  Congress  can
pick  pretty  much  any  activity  it  wishes  as  the  subject  of
taxation, and can then spend the funds for a purpose that has
no  relation  to  the  activity  taxed.  So  here,  the  fact  that
Congress is taxing trips that do not involve the 10 large cities,
and  then  spending  the  funds  solely  for  the  benefit  of
passengers whose travel does involve those 10 cities, makes
no difference.

(B) is wrong because, although the main conclusion is correct
(that the tax is constitutional), giving an exemption for cities
that would not be served would certainly not deny any other
purchasers  equal  protection.  In  the  case  of  economic
regulation not involving a suspect class or fundamental right,
the classification scheme merely needs to withstand easy-to-
satisfy  mere-rationality  review,  and  giving  an  exemption  for
travel  between  cities  not  involving  the  new  airports  would
certainly pass this easy test.

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  burden/benefit  analysis  used  here
would not be the proper test for a federally-imposed tax; the
burden/benefit  analysis  would  be  a  proper  way  to  analyze  a
state  regulation  that  might  burden  interstate  travel  and  thus
violate the dormant commerce clause, but the regulation here
is not by a state.

(D)  is  wrong  because,  while  the  Supreme  Court  has
occasionally  recognized  a  fundamental  “right  to  travel”  for
equal  protection  purposes,  these  cases  have  involved  what
would better be called the right to “migrate interstate,” (e.g.,
the  right  to  change  one’s  state  of  residence  and  still  receive
welfare benefits), not the right to take a trip from one state to
another.

B.  Spending power

1.  General welfare

Question  17:  A  newly  enacted  federal  statute  appropriates
$100  million  in  federal  funds  to  support  basic  research  by
universities located in the United States. The statute provides

71

that “the ten best universities in the United States” will each
receive  $10  million.  It  also  provides  that  “the  ten  best
universities” shall be “determined by a poll of the presidents
of  all  the  universities  in  the  nation,  to  be  conducted  by  the
United States Department of Education.” In responding to that
poll, each university president is required to apply the well-
recognized  and  generally  accepted  standards  of  academic
quality that are specified in the statute. The provisions of the
statute are inseverable.

Which  of  the  following  statements  about  this  statute  is
correct?

(A)    The  statute  is  unconstitutional,  because  the  reliance  by
Congress  on  a  poll  of  individuals  who  are  not  federal
officials  to  determine  the  recipients  of  its  appropriated
funds  is  an  unconstitutional  delegation  of  legislative
power.

(B)  The statute is unconstitutional, because the limitation on
recipients  to  the  ten  best  universities  is  arbitrary  and
capricious and denies other high-quality universities the
equal protection of the laws.

(C)    The  statute  is  constitutional,  because  Congress  has
plenary authority to determine the objects of its spending
and  the  methods  used  to  achieve  them,  so  long  as  they
may reasonably be deemed to serve the general welfare
and  do  not  violate  any  prohibitory  language  in  the
Constitution.

(D)  The validity of the statute is nonjusticiable, because the
use  by  Congress  of  its  spending  power  necessarily
involves  political  considerations  that  must  be  resolved
finally  by  those  branches  of  the  government  that  are
closest to the political process.

Answer 17: Choice (C) is correct. Although Congress, when
it  spends,  must  spend  “for  the  general  welfare,”  this  test  is
extremely easy to satisfy — as the choice correctly states, all
that is required is that the spending be “reasonably deemed to
serve  the  general  welfare,”  and  that  it  not  violate  some
specific  constitutional  ban  (e.g.,  the  Establishment  Clause’s
ban on spending for the purpose of advancing religion). Since
Congress  could  rationally  have  believed  that  rewarding  the

72

“best  universities”  would  promote  the  country’s  general
welfare,  and  that  determining  the  “ten  best”  by  this  kind  of
vote  was  a  rational  way  to  go  about  attaining  that  end,  the
spending is constitutional.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  statute  here  is  an  acceptable
exercise  of  legislative  delegation:  Congress  has  made  it
reasonably  clear  to  the  Dept.  of  Education  what  they  are  to
do, and how they are to do it, so there is no “unconstitutional
delegation” despite the fact that non-federal officials will be
somehow involved in the process.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  when  a  governmental  classification
does  not  involve  a  suspect  or  semi-suspect  class  or
fundamental  right,  equal  protection  requires  only  a  rational
relation  between 
legitimate
governmental objective, and the means and end here meet this
easy-to-satisfy  standard.  (To  put  it  another  way,  limiting  the
money to the “top ten,” and picking the top ten this way, are
not “arbitrary and capricious” methods.)

the  means  chosen  and  a 

(D) is wrong because the mere fact that Congress’s use of its
spending power is being challenged does not make the matter
a nonjusticiable political question.

IV.  THE SEPARATION OF POWERS

A.  Separation of powers generally

1.  President can’t make the laws

a.  Delegation

i.  Requirements for delegation

Question 18: Congress passed a statute directing the United
States Forest Service, a federal agency, to issue regulations to
control  campfires  on  federal  public  lands  and  to  establish  a
schedule  of  penalties  for  those  who  violate  the  new
regulations.  The  statute  provided  that  the  Forest  Service
regulations  should  “reduce,  to  the  maximum  extent  feasible,
all  potential  hazards  that  arise  from  campfires  on  Forest
Service lands.” The Forest Service issued the regulations and
the  schedule  of  penalties  directed  by  Congress.  The

73

regulations include a rule that provides for the doubling of the
fine  for  any  negligent  or  prohibited  use  of  fire  if  the  user  is
intoxicated by alcohol or drugs.

Which of the following is the best argument for sustaining the
constitutionality of the Forest Service’s rule providing for the
fines?

(A)  The executive branch of government, of which the Forest
Service  is  part,  has  inherent  rule-making  authority  over
public lands.

(B)    The  rule  is  issued  pursuant  to  a  valid  exercise  of
Congress’s  power  to  delegate  rule-  making  authority  to
federal agencies.

(C)    The  rule  is  justified  by  a  compelling  governmental

interest in safeguarding forest resources.

(D)  The rule relates directly to law enforcement, which is an
executive  rather  than  legislative  function,  and  hence  it
does not need specific congressional authorization.
Answer  18:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Congress  can  only
delegate powers it possesses, so you first have to determine
whether Congress itself has power to regulate federal lands.
The  answer  is  “yes,”  because  Art.  I,  Sec.  8,  Cl.  17  gives
Congress power to regulate federal lands. Next, you have to
determine whether Congress validly delegated this power that
it  possesses.  Here,  too,  the  answer  is  “yes.”  Congress  may
delegate  rule-making  authority  to  federal  agencies  through
statutes  that  set  concrete  objectives  for  the  agency,  and  that
list  adequate  criteria  for  carrying  out  those  objectives.  The
Supreme  Court  has  been  very  deferential  in  applying  these
“concrete  objectives”  and  “adequate  criteria”  requirements.
The  objective  being  pursued  here  (control  of  campfires  on
federal lands) is quite concrete, and the criteria specified by
Congress  for  achieving  that  objective  (use  of  a  penalty
schedule  for  rule  violators)  seem  quite  adequate.  Therefore,
the  statute’s  provision  of  authority  to  the  Forest  Service
would likely be held to satisfy the requirements.
(A) is incorrect, because the executive branch does not have
inherent  rule-making  authority  over  public  lands.  The  only
source of federal power to regulate public lands is the grant

74

in Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 17, to Congress to regulate such lands, as
discussed  above.  So  the  executive’s  rule-making  authority
over  public  lands  comes  from  delegation  by  Congress,  not
from any inherent authority.

is  wrong  because 

the  compelling  nature  of 

(C) 
the
government’s  regulatory  interest  is  neither  necessary  nor
sufficient  to  justify  the  Forest  Service’s  regulation.  The
constitutional  requirement  is  merely  that  the  regulation  be
pursuant to a valid act of Congress, and that it not violate any
specific  constitutional  prohibition.  Since  the  act  is  a  valid
exercise  of  Congress’s  power  to  regulate  federal  lands,  and
since  the  delegation  was  validly  done  (as  described  in  (B)
above),  that’s  the  end  of  the  matter,  and  the  strength  of  the
federal interest never becomes relevant.

(D)  is  wrong  because,  although  law  enforcement  is  an
executive function, the constitutional exercise of that function
requires  that  the  executive  act  pursuant  to  congressional
authorization provided by law.

2.  Presidential Commissions

Question 19:  The  vaccination  of  children  against  childhood
contagious  diseases  (such  as  measles,  diphtheria,  and
whooping cough) has traditionally been a function of private
doctors  and  local  and  state  health  departments.  Because
vaccination rates have declined in recent years, especially in
urban areas, the President proposes to appoint a Presidential
Advisory  Commission  on  Vaccination  which  would  be
charged  with  conducting  a  national  publicity  campaign  to
encourage vaccination as a public health measure. No federal
statute authorizes or prohibits this action by the President. The
activities  of  the  Presidential  Advisory  Commission  on
funds
Vaccination  would  be 
appropriated  by  Congress  to  the  Office  of  the  President  for
“such other purposes as the President may think appropriate.”
May  the  President  constitutionally  create  such  a  commission
for this purpose?
(A)    Yes,  because  the  President  has  plenary  authority  to
provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the people
of the United States.

financed  entirely 

from 

75

(B)  Yes, because this action is within the scope of executive
authority vested in the President by the Constitution, and
no federal statute prohibits it.

(C)    No,  because  the  protection  of  children  against  common
diseases  by  vaccination  is  a  traditional  state  function
and,  therefore,  is  reserved  to  the  states  by  the  Tenth
Amendment.

(D)  No, because Congress has not specifically authorized the
creation and support of such a new federal agency.
Answer  19:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  setting  up  of  a
presidential advisory commission, such as the one here, falls
within  the  President’s  executive  powers — nothing  in  the
facts  indicates  that  the  commission  will  have  legislative  or
judicial powers, so the commission is a proper delegation by
the President of his executive power. As to funding: Congress
has the right to earmark specified federal monies to be spent
as the President shall determine. Therefore, nothing about this
arrangement violates any constitutional provision.
(A)  is  wrong,  because  the  President  does  not  have  “plenary
power  to  provide  for  the  health,  safety,  and  welfare  of  the
people. . . .” For instance, the President does not have power
to  spend  federal  money  for  what  he  determines  to  be  the
health  needs  of  “the  people.”  This  answer  ignores  both  the
source  of  the  President’s  authority  (which  is  limited  to  the
executive  power,  that  is,  the  power  to  see  that  the  laws  are
carried out) and the need for all funding to be appropriated by
Congress.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  incorrectly  states  the  effect  of  the
Tenth  Amendment.  The  Tenth  Amendment  states  that  the
powers  not  delegated  to  the  federal  government  by  the
Constitution, and not prohibited to the states, are reserved to
the  states.  The  Tenth  Amendment  has  relatively  little  force
today as a limit on federal power. (About the only force it has
as  a  limit  on  federal  powers  is  to  prevent  Congress  from
directly  forcing  the  states  to  enact  or  enforce  federal
policies.)  The  Amendment  does  not  mean  that  the  federal
government may not exercise power over a “traditional state
function.” So the fact that vaccination has traditionally been a
function  handled  by  the  states  does  not  mean  that  the  Tenth

76

Amendment  bars  the  federal  government  from  taking  action
with respect to vaccinations.

(D)  is  wrong,  because  Congress  does  not  need  to  authorize
the  creation  of  a  temporary  commission.  An  Advisory
Commission on Vaccination is not a new federal agency — it
is an advisory group, set up for a specific purpose and having
a 
temporary  existence.  The  President  does  not  need
congressional  approval  to  create  such  an  organization.  Nor
has Congress prohibited its creation (which if it had happened
might  bar  creation  of  the  Commission)  because,  as  the  facts
state, no federal statute authorizes or prohibits this action.

3.  The veto power, and Congress’s power to override it

Question 20: An appropriations act passed by Congress over
the President’s veto directs that one billion dollars “shall be
spent”  by  the  federal  government  for  the  development  of  a
new military weapons system, which is available only from a
particular  arms  manufacturer.  On  the  order  of  the  President,
the secretary of defense refuses to authorize a contract for the
purchase  of  the  weapons  system.  The  manufacturer  sues  the
secretary  of  defense,  alleging  an  unlawful  withholding  of
these federal funds.

strongest  constitutional  argument 

The 
manufacturer is that

for 

the  arms

(A)    passage  of  an  appropriation  over  a  veto  makes  the

spending mandatory.

(B)    Congress’s  power  to  appropriate  funds  includes  the
power to require that the funds be spent as directed.
(C)  the President’s independent constitutional powers do not

specifically refer to spending.

(D)  the President’s power to withhold such funds is limited to
cases where foreign affairs are directly involved.

Answer  20:  Choice  (B)  is  correct,  because  it’s  the  only
choice  that  addresses  the  central  issue  under  these  facts,
impoundment,  and  offers  a  solid  argument  for  the  arms
manufacturer.  “Impoundment”  is  the  President’s  refusal  to
spend  funds  appropriated  by  Congress.  The  rule  is  that  the
President  does  not  have  the  power  to  refuse  to  spend  funds
that  were  appropriated  with  an  express  mandate  from

77

Congress  that  the  funds  be  spent.  Kendall  v.  United  States
(1838).  Here,  Congress  mandated  that  the  billion  dollars
“shall  be  spent”  for  the  weapons  system;  thus,  the  President
must authorize the contract for purchase of the system. (Note,
incidentally, that the Supreme Court has decided only that the
President may not impound funds that Congress has expressly
mandated  be  spent;  where  Congress  merely  appropriates
without  an  expresss  “you  must  spend”  direction  to  the
President, the Supreme Court has never decided whether the
President may impound.)

(A)  is  wrong  because  Congress’s  passing  an  appropriation
over a veto does not by itself require the President to spend
the  appropriated  funds.  A  veto  occurs  when  the  President
refuses  to  sign  a  bill  passed  by  Congress.  Congress  can
override  a  presidential  veto  with  a  two-thirds  vote  of  both
Houses.  The  President’s  power  to  impound  does  not  depend
on whether the bill became law because the President signed
it, or because Congress overrode the President’s veto. Rather,
as  noted  in  Choice  (B)  above,  the  Court  has  held  that  the
President does not have the power to impound funds that were
appropriated with an express mandate from Congress that the
funds  be  spent,  a  rule  that  does  not  depend  on  the  exact
process  by  which  the  law  appropriating  the  funds  became
law.
(C)  is  wrong  because  the  argument  it  makes  would  not
funds
authorize 
appropriated  by  Congress.  It’s  true  that  Congress  holds  the
enumerated  power  to  tax  and  spend  for  the  general  welfare.
The  President,  on  the  other  hand,  has  the  power  to  enforce
laws,  which 
includes  carrying  out  spending  programs
authorized  by  Congress  once  those  programs  become  law
(either  because  the  President  signed  the  bill  authorizing  the
program,  or  because  Congress  passed  the  bill  over  the
President’s  veto).  However,  this  choice  doesn’t  specifically
address  whether  the  President  can  refuse  to  spend  funds
appropriated  by  Congress;  the  answer  is  that  he  cannot  so
refuse,  at  least  where  Congress  “directs”  that  he  spend  the
funds, a situation best addressed by Choice (B).
(D) is wrong, because the President’s power of impoundment

the  President 

to  withhold 

spending 

78

does not turn on the subject matter of the legislation. It’s true
that the President holds broad powers with respect to foreign
affairs, and it’s possible that, since the spending here involves
a  weapons  system,  the  President’s  power  to  spend  or  not
spend  would  control.  But  even  if  it  did,  this  certainly
wouldn’t  be  a  good  argument  for  the  arms  manufacturer,
which  would  be  trying  to  argue  that  the  President  has  no
power  to  withhold  spending  funds  Congress  appropriated,
and in this question you’re looking for the manufacturer’s best
argument.  This  choice  ignores  the  central  issue  under  these
facts:  the  President’s  right  of  impoundment,  i.e.,  his  right  to
refuse  to  spend  funds  appropriated  by  Congress.  Choice  (B)
correctly deals with that issue.

4.  Appointment and removal of executive personnel

Question  21:  A  federal  statute  with  inseverable  provisions
established  a  new  five-member  board  with  broad  regulatory
powers  over  the  operation  of  the  securities,  banking,  and
commodities  industries,  including  the  power  to  issue  rules
with  the  force  of  law.  The  statute  provides  for  three  of  the
board  members  to  be  appointed  by  the  President  with  the
advice  and  consent  of  the  Senate.  They  serve  seven-year
terms and are removable only for good cause. The other two
members of the board were designated in the statute to be the
respective  general  counsel  of  the  Senate  and  House  of
Representatives Committees on Government Operations. The
statute stipulated that they were to serve on the board for as
long as they continued in those positions.

Following  all  required  administrative  procedures,  the  board
issued an elaborate set of rules regulating the operations of all
banks,  securities  dealers,  and  commodities  brokers.  A
securities  company,  which  was  subject  to  the  board’s  rules,
sought  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  rules  were  invalid
because 
board  was
unconstitutional.  In  this  case,  the  court  should  rule  that  the
statute establishing the board is
(A)  unconstitutional, because all members of federal boards
having broad powers that are quasi-legislative in nature,
such as rulemaking, must be appointed by Congress.

establishing 

statute 

the 

the 

79

(B)    unconstitutional,  because  all  members  of  federal  boards
exercising  executive  powers  must  be  appointed  by  the
President  or  in  a  manner  otherwise  consistent  with  the
Appointments Clause of Article II.

(C)  constitutional, because the Necessary and Proper Clause
authorizes  Congress  to  determine  the  means  by  which
members  are  appointed  to  boards  created  by  Congress
under its power to regulate commerce among the states.

(D)    constitutional,  because  there  is  a  substantial  nexus
between  the  power  of  Congress  to  legislate  for  the
general welfare and the means specified by Congress in
this statute for the appointment of board members.
Answer  21:  The  correct  choice  is  (B),  because  Congress
cannot constitutionally designate two members of this board.
Under the Appointments Clause, the President, not Congress,
is  given  the  power  to  appoint  federal  officers.  So  Congress
itself  may  not  make  any  appointments  of  federal  officers
(defined as federal officials who exercise executive power).
The  statute  here  endowed  the  board  with  broad  rule-making
powers. In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Court held that rule-
making  is  an  executive  function,  so  that  the  members  of  a
board or agency with rule-making powers are federal officers
who must be appointed by the President. So here, the fact that
two  of  the  board’s  five  members  are  directly  designated  by
Congress violates the Appointments Clause.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  powers  here  are  not  “quasi-
legislative.”  Congress  may  make  its  own  appointments  of
persons  to  exercise  powers  that  are  essentially  of  an
investigative or informative nature — such powers would be
“quasi-legislative.”  But  where  the  appointee’s  powers  are
essentially  rule-making  rather  than  investigative,  this  is  an
executive function, not a legislative function. Consequently, as
described  in  Choice  (B)  above,  it  is  the  President,  not
Congress, that has the right of appointment. So this choice is
correct  that  the  statute  is  unconstitutional  on  account  of
separation-of-powers  problems,  but  incorrect  about  what
those problems are.
(C)  is  wrong  because  although  the  Necessary  and  Proper
Clause  gives  the  Congress  the  power  to  create  the  board,  it

80

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

does  not  give  Congress  the  power  to  appoint  the  board’s
members. It’s true that where Congress is exercising one of its
enumerated powers, it may enact any law which is “necessary
and  proper  for  carrying  into  execution”  that  power.  So
Congress  can  regulate  the  securities  and  banking  industries
pursuant  to  its  commerce  power,  and  it  can  enact  laws  to
carry out that regulation. But as explained in the discussion of
Choice (B), the Appointments Clause means that the power to
appoint members of the board (who are exercising rulemaking
authority and are thus “federal officers”) falls to the President
under the Appointments Clause. Nothing in the Necessary and
Proper Clause overcomes this Appointments-Clause problem.

(D) is wrong because (1) it ignores the Appointments-Clause
problem described in the discussion of Choice (B); and (2) it
falsely  indicates  that  Congress  has  a  free-standing  power  to
pass  laws  that  are  for  the  “general  welfare.”  As  to  (1),  the
Appointments Clause, as interpreted by the Court, means that
“Officers  of  the  United  States”  must  be  appointed  by  the
President,  not  Congress.  The  board  members  here  are
exercising rule-making powers, which makes them executive-
branch members (i.e., “federal officers), so the fact that two
of them are appointed by Congress violates this Clause. As to
(2),  the  general  welfare  clause,  Article  1,  §  8  states  that
Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, to pay
debts and to provide for the common defense and the general
welfare. This clause gives Congress the substantive power to
tax and appropriate money. But it does not confer on Congress
a  free-standing  power  to  regulate  to  achieve  the  general
welfare. So Congress’s general welfare power is irrelevant to
the constitutionality of the regulatory statute here.

CHAPTER 3
TWO LIMITS ON STATE POWER: THE
DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE AND
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION

I.    THE DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE

A.  Dormant Commerce Clause generally

1.  Protectionism

Question 22: A toy manufacturer that has its headquarters and
sole  manufacturing  plant  in  the  state  of  Green  developed  a
“Martian”  toy  that  simulates  the  exploration  of  Mars  by  a
remote-controlled  vehicle.  It  accurately  depicts  the  Martian
landscape and the unmanned exploratory vehicle traversing it.
The  toy  is  of  high  quality,  safe,  durable,  and  has  sold  very
well.  Other  toy  manufacturers,  all  located  outside  Green,
developed  similar  toys  that  are  lower  in  price.  These
manufacturers  have  contracts  to  sell  their  Martian  toys  to
outlets  in  Green.  Although  these  toys  are  safe  and  durable,
they  depict  the  Martian  landscape  less  realistically  than  the
toys  manufactured  in  Green.  Nevertheless,  because  of  the
price difference, sales of these toys have cut severely into the
sales  of  the  Martian  toys  manufactured  in  Green.  The  Green
legislature subsequently enacted a law “to protect the children
of  Green  from  faulty  science  and  to  protect  Green  toy
manufacturers from unfair competition.” This law forbids the
to  represent
sale 
extraterrestrial  objects  and  does  not  satisfy  specified
scientific  criteria.  The  Martian  toy  manufactured  in  Green
satisfies all of these criteria; none of the Martian toys of the
competing manufacturers meets the requirements.
Is the Green law constitutional?
(A)  No, because it abrogates the obligations of the contracts
between  the  other  toy  manufacturers  and  their  Green
outlets who have agreed to sell their Martian toys.
(B)    No,  because  it  imposes  an  undue  burden  on  interstate

in  Green  of  any 

that  purports 

toy 

commerce.

82

(C)  Yes, because it deals only with a local matter, the sale of

toys in Green stores.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  state’s  interest  in  protecting  the  state’s
children  from  faulty  science  justifies  this  burden  on
interstate commerce.

Answer  22:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  Commerce  Clause
gives  Congress  the  power  to  regulate  commerce  among  the
states  and,  by  negative  implication,  restricts  the  regulatory
power of the states with respect to interstate commerce. Any
state law that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce
must  not  be  protectionist  (i.e.,  must  not  benefit  in-state
interests at the expense of out-of-state interests) or otherwise
impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. A state law
that discriminates against interstate commerce is protectionist
unless  it  serves  a  legitimate  local  interest  that  cannot  be
served  by  nondiscriminatory  legislation.  By  barring  the  sale
in Green of the Martian toys manufactured in other states, the
state  law  here  has  a  substantial  negative  effect  on  interstate
commerce. Although the law does not explicitly discriminate
against  the  out-of-state  toy  manufacturers,  it  has  a  purely
discriminatory  effect  against  them,  and  the  state  has  less
discriminatory alternatives available to protect the legitimate
interests cited in the law (e.g., better public education about
the  nonsensicality  of  extraterrestrialism).  The  state  law
therefore violates the negative implications of the Commerce
Clause.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  while  it  is  true  that  the  Green  law  is
unconstitutional,  this  answer  misstates  the  basis  for  this
conclusion.  The  Contracts  Clause  (Article  I,  Section  10,
Clause  1  of  the  Constitution)  does  not  forbid  state  laws
affecting contractual relations between private parties so long
as  they  are  reasonably  related  to  a  legitimate  state  interest.
Because  the  courts  typically  defer  to  state  regulations  of
private contracts as reasonable, the statute at issue here is not
likely to be found unconstitutional under the Contracts Clause.
(C) is wrong because the fact that the matter being regulated
is  arguably  a  “local  matter”  is  not  a  defense  to  a  dormant
commerce  clause  claim,  if  the  state’s  form  of  regulation
discriminates  against  out-of-state  producers.  So  the  fact  that

83

education is arguably a “local” state matter won’t protect the
obviously-protectionist statute here.

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  is  not  a  defense  to  protectionist
legislation  (i.e.,  legislation  that  intends  to  protect  in-state
economic interests at the expense of out-of-staters, or has that
clear effect) that the state is also attempting to achieve some
otherwise-permissible  state  objective.  So  here,  although  the
state’s  interest  in  protecting  children  from  faulty  science  is
legitimate,  that  interest  does  not  justify  the  law’s  intentional
discrimination  against  out-of-staters  where  the  state  has  less
discriminatory  alternatives  available  to  protect  that  interest
(e.g., better science education).

Question 23:  Small  retailers  located  in  the  state  of  Yellow
were  concerned  about  the  loss  of  business  to  certain  large
retailers  located  nearby  in  bordering  states.  In  an  effort  to
deal  with  this  concern,  the  legislature  of  Yellow  enacted  a
statute  requiring  all  manufacturers  and  wholesalers  who  sell
goods  to  retailers  in  Yellow  to  do  so  at  prices  that  are  no
higher  than  the  lowest  prices  at  which  they  sell  them  to
retailers  in  any  of  the  states  that  border  Yellow.  Several
manufacturers  and  wholesalers  who  are  located  in  states
bordering  Yellow  and  who  sell  their  goods  to  retailers  in
those states and in Yellow bring an action in federal court to
challenge the constitutionality of this statute.

Which  of  the  following  arguments  offered  by  these  plaintiffs
is  likely  to  be  most  persuasive  in  light  of  applicable
precedent?

The state statute

(A)    deprives  them  of  their  property  or  liberty  without  due

process of law.

(B)  imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.
(C)    deprives  them  of  a  privilege  or  immunity  of  national

citizenship.

(D)  denies them the equal protection of the laws.
Answer 23: Choice (B) is correct. This is a classic case of
protectionism:  The  in-state  retailers  have  persuaded  the
legislature to strengthen the in-staters’ economic position vis-
à-vis out-of-state retailers (since small in-state retailers now

84

get an advantage that small out-of-state retailers don’t get, and
get  an  unearned  cost-equality  with 
large  out-of-state
retailers).  So  out-of-state  retailers  are  being  discriminated
against  (treated  less  favorably  by  virtue  of  their  out-of-state
status).  This  sort  of  protectionism  is  virtually  a  per  se
violation of the dormant commerce clause, and is certainly an
undue burden on commerce.

(A)  is  wrong  because  economic  regulation  that  does  not
involve  a  suspect  class  or  fundamental  right  (and  the
regulation  here  involves  neither)  will  receive  only  mere-
rationality  review  under  the  Due  Process  Clause,  and  the
measure here would pass that review.

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  privileges  and  immunities  of
“national” (as opposed to state) citizenship are guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment, Sec. 1; that P&I Clause, however,
would not protect the plaintiffs here because only a few rights
have  been  recognized  as  rights  of  national  citizenship  for
purposes  of  the  Clause  (e.g.,  the  right  to  travel  physically
from state to state, to move from state to state, and to vote in
national elections), and the right of an out-of-stater to be free
of economic discrimination is not one of them. (The plaintiffs
might  win  with  an  argument  based  on  Art.  IV’s  P&I  Clause,
which  protects  against  discrimination  by  a  state  against  out-
of-staters;  however,  that  Clause  doesn’t  protect  the  rights  of
“national  citizenship,”  but  rather, 
the  rights  of  state
citizenship.)

(D)  is  wrong  because  economic  regulations  that  do  not
involve a suspect or semi-suspect class or fundamental right
receive only easy-to-satisfy mere-rationality review under the
Equal Protection Clause, and the statute here would pass that
review (since the legislature could reasonably have believed
that  its  citizens  would  fare  better,  overall,  if  small  local
retailers  were  not  at  a  disadvantage  to  large  out-of-state
retailers).

2.  Lack of uniformity

Question  24:  In  recent  years,  several  large  corporations
incorporated and headquartered in a state have suddenly been
acquired  by  out-of-state  corporations  that  have  moved  all  of

85

the  state.  Other  corporations
their  operations  out  of 
incorporated and headquartered in the state have successfully
resisted  such  attempts  at  acquisition  by  out-of-state
corporations,  but  they  have  suffered  severe  economic  injury
during those acquisition attempts.

In  an  effort  to  preserve  jobs  in  the  state  and  to  protect  its
domestic corporations against their sudden acquisition by out-
of-state  purchasers,  the  state  legislature  enacts  a  statute
in  all  corporations
governing  acquisitions  of  shares 
incorporated  in  the  state.  This  statute  requires  that  any
acquisition of more than 25 percent of the voting shares of a
corporation incorporated in the state that occurs over a period
of less than one year must be approved by the shareholders of
record of a majority of the shares of the corporation as of the
day  before  the  commencement  of  the  acquisition  of  those
shares.  The  statute  expressly  applies  to  acquisitions  of  in-
state  corporations  by  both  in-state  and  out-of-state  entities.
Assume  that  no  federal  statute  applies.  Is  this  state  statute
constitutional?

(A)    No,  because  one  of  the  purposes  of  the  statute  is  to
prevent out-of-state entities from acquiring corporations
incorporated and headquartered in the state.

(B)  No, because the effect of the statute will necessarily be to
hinder  the  acquisition  of  in-state  corporations  by  other
corporations,  many  of  whose  shareholders  are  not
residents  of  the  state  and,  therefore,  it  will  adversely
affect the interstate sale of securities.

(C)  Yes, because the statute imposes the same burden on both
in-state  and  out-of-state  entities  wishing  to  acquire  a
corporation in the state, it regulates only the acquisition
of  in-state  corporations,  and  it  does  not  create  an
impermissible  risk  of  inconsistent  regulation  on  this
subject by different states.

(D)    Yes,  because  corporations  exist  only  by  virtue  of  state
law  and,  therefore,  the  negative  implications  of  the
Commerce  Clause  do  not  apply  to  state  regulations
governing their creation and acquisition.

Answer  24:  The  correct  choice  is  (C),  because  the  state’s
statute does not violate the dormant commerce clause, in that

86

it  neither  unduly  burdens,  nor  intentionally  discriminates
against,  out-of-state  economic  interests.  Under  the  dormant
commerce clause, a regulation will be valid if it: (1) does not
intentionally  discriminate  against  out-of-state  competition  to
benefit  local  economic  interests;  and  (2)  is  not  unduly
burdensome,  in  that  the  incidental  burden  on  interstate
commerce  does  not  outweigh  the  legitimate  local  benefits
produced by the regulation. The statute here is constitutional
because it passes both tests. As to the first test: Although the
statute  seeks  to  benefit  local  economic  interests,  it  does  not
discriminate against out-of-state competition in the method it
employs to protect domestic corporations. That is so because
the statute, by requiring that any acquisition of more than 25%
of the voting shares of a corporation incorporated in the state
be  approved  by  the  holders  of  record  of  a  majority  of  the
corporation’s  shares,  imposes  exactly  the  same  burden  on
both in-state and out-of-state entities wishing to acquire an in-
state corporation.

to 

The second requirement is that the regulation not be “unduly
burdensome” 
interstate  commerce.  The  statute  here
regulates  only  the  acquisition  of  in-state  corporations,  and
there is no obvious large burden on out-of-staters that want to
acquire 
in-state  corporations.  Since  only  corporations
incorporated  in  the  state  are  covered  by  the  statute,  one
important  form  of  undue  burden — the  inconsistent  state-by-
state regulation of a corporation incorporated in another state 
— does  not  occur.  Thus,  the  second  prong  of  the  test  is
satisfied.

it  harder 

The  act  here  is  similar  to  one  upheld  by  the  Court  against
Commerce Clause attack in CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of
Amer.  (1987)  (statute  making 
to  acquire  a
corporation incorporated in the state upheld because, “to the
limited extent that the Act affects interstate commerce, this is
justified  by  the  State’s  interests  in  defining  the  attributes  of
shares in its corporations and in protecting shareholders.”)
(A)  is  wrong  because  dormant  commerce  clause  attacks
generally  won’t  succeed  unless  the  plaintiff  shows  either  a
discriminatory intent (less-favored treatment of out-of-staters
than in-staters) or an “undue burden” on commerce. (See the

87

discussion of Choice (C) above.) The mere fact that one of the
regulation’s  purposes  is  to  prevent  out-of-staters  from  doing
something  unsatisfactory  won’t  be  enough,  if  in-staters  are
also prevented (since then there is no discrimination).

(B) is wrong because the presence of an “adverse effect” on
an  interstate  market  does  not  suffice  for  a  violation  of  the
dormant commerce clause. As is discussed more fully in the
treatment  of  Choice  (C)  above,  a  plaintiff  in  a  dormant
show  either
commerce  clause  case  must  generally 
discrimination  against  interstate  commerce,  or  a  “substantial
burden” on it. (B), by making the test be whether there is any
sort of “adverse effect” at all, is not the right test.

true 

(D)  is  wrong  because  it’s  an  incorrect  statement  about  what
the  dormant  commerce  clause  prohibits.  It’s 
that
corporations  exist  only  by  virtue  of  state  law.  It’s  also  true
that a state probably has greater freedom in how it regulates
its  own  domestic  (i.e.,  state-chartered)  corporations  than  in
some  other  areas  of  regulation.  But  an  anti-takeover  statute,
even  if  applied  only  to  state-chartered  targets,  would  still
violate  the  dormant  commerce  clause  if  it  discriminated
against — i.e., treated less favorably — out-of-state acquirers
than  in-state  acquirers  (for  instance,  by  requiring  a  higher
percentage  of  target  stockholders  to  approve  an  out-of-state
takeover than a domestic takeover). So when (D) says that the
“negative implications of the commerce clause” (an accurate
way to refer to the dormant commerce clause) “do not apply
to  state  regulations  governing  [domestic  corporations’]
creation  and  acquisition,”  the  choice  is  not  stating  the  law
correctly.

3.  Discrimination against foreign commerce

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

Question 25: In response to massive layoffs of employees of
automobile assembly plants located in the state of Ames, the
legislature  of  that  state  enacted  a  statute  which  prohibits  the
parking  of  automobiles  manufactured  outside  of  the  United
States in any parking lot or parking structure that is owned or
operated  by  the  state  or  any  of  its  instrumentalities.  This
statute does not apply to parking on public streets.
Which of the following is the strongest argument with which

88

to challenge the constitutionality of this statute?

(A)    The  statute  imposes  an  undue  burden  on  foreign

(B) 

commerce.
  The  statute  denies 
automobiles the equal protection of the laws.

the  owners  of  foreign-made

(C)    The  statute  deprives  the  owners  of  foreign-made
automobiles  of  liberty  or  property  without  due  process
of law.

(D)    The  statute  is  inconsistent  with  the  privileges  and

immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Answer  25:  The  correct  choice  is  (A).  Ames  is  making
foreign  cars  materially  less  attractive  to  Ames  residents,  so
residents are likely to buy fewer of them. Therefore, Ames is
discriminating  against  foreign  imports  and  in  favor  of  U.S.-
made cars. Since such a rule would clearly be held to be an
undue  burden  on  “domestic”  interstate  commerce  if  it  were
applied to the parking of cars made in U.S. states other than
Ames,  it  will  found  to  be  an  undue  burden  here,  since
restraints  on  foreign  commerce  are  if  anything  scrutinized
more strictly than restraints on domestic interstate commerce.

(B)  is  wrong  because  this  is  an  economic  regulation  not
involving  a  suspect  class  or  fundamental  right  (there’s  no
fundamental right to park in state-operated parking facilities),
so  it  will  be  upheld  as  long  as  it’s  rationally  related  to
achievement of a legitimate state objective; the measure here
would meet this easy-to-satisfy test, since it’s at least rational
to believe that making it harder to park will cut down on the
number of foreign cars sold in Ames and thus make in-state-
produced cars more economically viable.

is  not  “fundamental”  (parking 

(C) is wrong, because (1) it’s not clear that a person has any
liberty  or  property  interest  in  being  able  to  park  in  a  state-
owned  facility;  and  (2)  even  if  there  is  such  an  interest,  the
interest 
in  state-owned
facilities has not been held to be a fundamental right for due
process  purposes — only  some  privacy/autonomy-related
rights have this status), so the measure would merely need to
satisfy the easy rational-relation test, which it does.
(D) is wrong because the Fourteenth Amendment P&I Clause

89

protects only the rights of “national citizenship,” and the right
to  park  in  a  state-owned  facility  is  certainly  not  a  right  of
national citizenship.

II.   CONGRESSIONAL PRE-EMPTION AND
CONSENT; THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE

A.  The Supremacy Clause and federal pre-emption

1.  Direct conflict

a.  Congress forbids, state allows

Question 26: Congressional hearings determined that the use
of  mechanical  power  hammers  is  very  dangerous  to  the
persons  using  them  and  to  persons  in  the  vicinity  of  the
persons  using  them.  As  a  result,  Congress  enacted  a  statute
prohibiting  the  use  of  mechanical  power  hammers  on  all
construction  projects  in  the  United  States.  Subsequently,  a
study  conducted  by  a  private  research  firm  concluded  that
nails  driven  by  mechanical  power  hammers  have  longer-
lasting  joining  power  than  hand-driven  nails.  After  learning
about this study, the city council of the city of Green enacted
an amendment to its building safety code requiring the use of
mechanical  power  hammers  in  the  construction  of  all
buildings intended for human habitation.

This amendment to the city of Green’s building safety code is

(A)  unconstitutional, because it was enacted subsequent to the

federal statute.

(B)  unconstitutional, because it conflicts with the provisions

of the federal statute.

(C)    constitutional,  because  the  federal  statute  does  not
expressly indicate that it supersedes inconsistent state or
local laws.

(D)    constitutional,  because  the  long-term  safety  of  human
habitations  justifies  some  additional  risk  to  the  people
engaged in their construction.

Answer  26:  The  correct  choice  is  (B).  This  is  a  relatively
easy  case  in  which  Congress  is  forbidding  action  X  (use  of
mechanical  power  hammers)  and  the  state  is  purporting  to

90

allow  that  very  same  action  X.  So  this  is  about  as  simple  a
case of preemption by operation of the Supremacy Clause as
could be imagined.

(A) is wrong because where federal and state rules conflict,
the Supremacy Clause causes the state regulation to be invalid
even if it was enacted subsequent to the federal rule.

(C)  is  wrong  because  state  rules  that  directly  conflict  with
federal

(D) is wrong because whether or not a state regulation might
represent a better balance of risk and reward than a directly-
conflicting  federal  regulation,  the  state  law  must  yield  on
account of the Supremacy Clause.

b.  Conflict between aims

Question  27:  The  United  States  Department  of  the  Interior
granted the plaintiff the food and drink concession in a federal
park located in the state of Purple. The plaintiff operated his
concession out of federally owned facilities in the park. The
federal  statute  authorizing  the  Interior  Department  to  grant
such concessions provided that the grantees would pay only a
nominal  rental  for  use  of  these  federal  facilities  because  of
the  great  benefit  their  concessions  would  provide  to  the
people of the United States.

The  legislature  of  the  state  of  Purple  enacted  a  statute
imposing  an  occupancy  tax  on  the  occupants  of  real  estate
within  that  state  that  is  not  subject  to  state  real  estate  taxes.
The  statute  was  intended  to  equalize  the  state  tax  burden  on
such occupants with that on people occupying real estate that
is subject to state real estate taxes. Pursuant to that statute, the
Purple  Department  of  Revenue  attempted  to  collect  the  state
occupancy tax from the plaintiff because the federal facilities
occupied by the plaintiff were not subject to state real estate
taxes. The plaintiff sued to invalidate the state occupancy tax
as applied to him.
The strongest ground upon which the plaintiff could challenge
the occupancy tax is that it violates the

91

(A)    Commerce  Clause  by  unduly  burdening  the  interstate

tourist trade.

(B)    Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  by  interfering  with  the  fundamental  right  to
do business on federal property.

(C)    Equal  Protection  of  the  Laws  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  because  the  tax  treats  him  less  favorably
than  federal  concessionaires  in  other  states  who  do  not
have to pay such occupancy taxes.

(D)    Supremacy  Clause  of  Article  VI  and  the  federal  statute

authorizing such concessions.

Answer  27:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  federal  concession
statute, by requiring a nominal rental on account of the great
public  benefit  from  concessions,  shows  a  federal  intent  to
keep  the  total  occupancy  costs  for  concessionaires  low.  The
state  occupancy  tax  has  the  effect  (and  purpose)  of  making
occupancy  costs  higher  for  the  affected  taxpayers  than  it
would otherwise be. This fact is coupled with the fact that the
state  is  singling  out  taxpayers  on  non-state-taxed  property,
including  federally-owned  property,  so  the  interference  with
federal interests is especially acute. Therefore, a court might
well  hold  that  the  state  law  so  undermines  the  federal
purposes  as  to  be  invalid  under  the  Supremacy  Clause.  The
court would not necessarily reach this conclusion, but this is
the most powerful of the four arguments.

(A) is wrong because the occupancy tax does not discriminate
against interstate commerce (since the effect on tourists from
inside Purple is the same as on out-of-state tourists), and it is
unlikely that subjecting the plaintiff to the same overall level
of  taxation  as  businesses  located  in  state-taxable  facilities
would be found to be an “undue burden.”

(B) is wrong because the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges
and  Immunities  Clause  protects  only  certain  very  limited
rights of “national citizenship” (mostly the right to travel from
state  to  state),  and  the  Clause  has  never  been  interpreted  to
protect  a  “fundamental  right  to  do  business  on  federal
property.” (It’s true that the P&I Clause of Art. IV protects the
fundamental right to pursue one’s business or profession, but
the  examiners  have  tried  to  trick  you  here  by  using  the

92

Fourteenth Amendment’s P&I Clause, not the Art. IV Clause.)

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  Equal
Protection Clause protects only against a given state’s unfair
classification  of  multiple  persons,  not  against  one  state’s
treating  a  person  less  favorably  than  other  states  treat
similarly-situated  persons.  (Also,  any  classification  being
done  by  Purple  here  does  not  involve  a  suspect  or  semi-
suspect  class  or  a  fundamental  right,  so  the  classification
merely  has  to  be  rationally  related  to  the  achievement  of  a
legitimate  state  objective,  and  the  occupancy  tax  here  meets
this easy-to-satisfy standard.)

Question  28:  Road  Lines  is  an  interstate  bus  company
operating in a five-state area. A federal statute authorizes the
Interstate  Commerce  Commission  (ICC)  to  permit  interstate
carriers  to  discontinue  entirely  any  unprofitable  route.  Road
Lines  applied  to  the  ICC  for  permission  to  drop  a  very
unprofitable  route  through  the  sparsely  populated  Shaley
Mountains.  The  ICC  granted  that  permission  even  though
Road  Lines  provided  the  only  public  transportation  into  the
region.

Foley  is  the  owner  of  a  mountain  resort  in  the  Shaley
Mountains,  whose  customers  usually  arrived  on  vehicles
operated  by  Road  Lines.  After  exhausting  all  available
federal administrative remedies, Foley filed suit against Road
Lines  in  the  trial  court  of  the  state  in  which  the  Shaley
Mountains  are  located  to  enjoin  the  discontinuance  by  Road
Lines  of  its  service  to  that  area.  Foley  alleged  that  the
discontinuance  of  service  by  Road  Lines  would  violate  a
statute  of  that  state  prohibiting  common  carriers  of  persons
from  abandoning  service  to  communities  having  no  alternate
form of public transportation.
The state court should
(A)  dismiss the action, because Foley lacks standing to sue.
(B)    direct  the  removal  of  the  case  to  federal  court,  because

this suit involves a substantial federal question.

(C)  hear the case on its merits and decide for Foley because,
on  these  facts,  a  federal  agency  is  interfering  with
essential state functions.

93

(D)    hear  the  case  on  its  merits  and  decide  for  Road  Lines,
because a valid federal law preempts the state statute on
which Foley relies.

Answer  28:  The  correct  choice  is  (D).  There  is  a  direct
conflict between the federal and state regulations in this case,
and  it  is  impossible  for  the  regulated  party  (Road  Lines)  to
obey  both  regulations  simultaneously.  That  is,  the  ICC  has
expressly permitted Road Lines to drop its route, and the state
statute  appears  to  prohibit  Road  Lines  from  dropping  the
route. Since the federal action is constitutional (it falls within
Congress’s  commerce  power),  under  the  Supremacy  Clause
the federal action preempts the state action.

(A) is wrong, because Foley does have standing. It’s true that
the  ICC,  in  taking  the  challenged  action  (letting  Road  Lines
drop  the  service),  was  not  intending  to  affect  Foley  and
probably was not even aware of Foley’s interest in the matter.
But  since  Foley  would  suffer 
imminent  and  concrete
economic  harm  from  the  challenged  action,  and  since  the
injury  he  would  suffer  will  be  at  least  somewhat  different
from that suffered by every local resident, Foley has standing
even though the challenged action was not directed at him.
(B) is incorrect because the state court does not have power
to order a removal to the federal courts. There is no process
by  which  a  state  court  judge  (rather  than  the  defendant)  can
compel  a  pending  state-court  case  to  be  removed  to  the
federal  courts.  And  that’s  true  whether  the  case  falls  within
the  state  court’s  jurisdiction  or  not.  So  the  case  will  not  be
removed unless the defendant takes action to remove it.

(C) is wrong because (1) there is probably no constitutional
rule that prevents the federal government from interfering with
any “essential state function”; and (2) even if there were such
a  rule,  it’s  highly  unlikely  that  such  an  interference  is
happening  here  (since  the  federal  government  is  merely
allowing  a  private  party  to  do  something,  not,  for  instance,
ordering the state to change or eliminate any state function).

i.  State common law

Question  29:  Lee  contracted  with  Mover,  an  interstate
carrier, to ship household goods from the state of Green to his
new home in the state of Pink. A federal statute provides that
all liability of an interstate mover to a shipper for loss of or
damage  to  the  shipper’s  goods  in  transit  is  governed
exclusively  by  the  contract  between  them.  The  statute  also
requires  the  mover  to  offer  a  shipper  at  least  two  contracts
with different levels of liability. In full compliance with that
federal  statute,  Mover  offered  Lee  a  choice  between  two
shipping agreements that provided different levels of liability
on the part of Mover. The more expensive contract provided
that  Mover  was  fully  liable  in  case  of  loss  or  damage.  The
less  expensive  contract  limited  Mover’s  liability  in  case  of
loss or damage to less than full value. Lee voluntarily signed
the  less  expensive  contract  with  Mover,  fixing  Mover’s
liability at less than the full value of the shipment.

Mover’s  truck  was  involved  in  an  accident  in  the  state  of
Pink. The accident was entirely a product of the negligence of
Mover’s  driver.  Lee’s  household  goods  were 
totally
destroyed. In accordance with the contract, Mover reimbursed
Lee for less than the full value of the goods. Lee then brought
suit  against  Mover  under  the  tort  law  of  the  state  of  Pink
claiming  that  he  was  entitled  to  be  reimbursed  for  the  full
value of the goods. Mover filed a motion to dismiss.

In this suit, the court should

(A)    dismiss  the  case,  because  the  federal  statute  governing
liability  of  interstate  carriers  is  the  supreme  law  of  the
land and preempts state tort law.

(B)    dismiss  the  case,  because  the  contractual  relationship
between Lee and Mover is governed by the Obligation of
Contracts Clause of the Constitution.

(C)    deny  the  motion  to  dismiss,  because  the  Full  Faith  and
Credit Clause of the Constitution requires that state tort
law be given effect.

(D)  deny the motion to dismiss, because it is unconstitutional
for a federal statute to authorize Mover to contract out of
any degree of liability for its own negligence.

Answer 29: Choice (A) is correct. When Congress passed the

95

statute saying that all liability of interstate movers would be
“governed  exclusively”  by  the  contract  between  the  two
parties, this manifested Congress’s intent to preempt the entire
field  of  regulation  of  liability  of  such  movers,  and  to  block
any non-contract form of recovery (such as recovery in tort).
If  Lee  were  permitted  to  recover  under  Pink  tort  law,  the
results would be at odds with this clear congressional intent
to occupy the field. This is, therefore, a classic illustration of
the supremacy of federal law over conflicting state law.

(B)  is  wrong  because  (in  part)  the  Obligation  of  Contracts
Clause  blocks  the  states  from  modifying  contracts  in  some
circumstances,  and  does  not  serve  as  any  kind  of  a  limit  on
when  Congress  may  modify  contracts.  (Also,  no  contract  is
being  modified  here,  so  even  if  the  state  had  said  by  statute
what  Congress  said  here,  there  would  be  no  obligation-of-
contracts problem.)

(C)  is  wrong,  because  (in  part)  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit
Clause does not act as a limit on what Congress may do (and
in  any  event  no  state  is  refusing  to  enforce  another  court’s
judgment, which is what the FF&C Clause requires states to
do).
(D)  is  wrong  because  nothing  in  constitutional  law  prevents
Congress from authorizing private parties to “contract out of .
.  .  liability  for  [their]  own  negligence,”  assuming  Congress
was acting pursuant to some enumerated power (such as, here,
the power to regulate interstate commerce).

3.  No conflict

a.  More stringent state regulations

Question  30:  Radon  is  a  harmful  gas  found  in  the  soil  of
certain  regions  of  the  United  States.  A  statute  of  the  state  of
Magenta  requires  occupants  of  residences  with  basements
susceptible to the intrusion of radon to have their residences
tested  for  the  presence  of  radon  and  to  take  specified
remedial  steps  if  the  test  indicates  the  presence  of  radon
above  specified  levels.  The  statute  also  provides  that  the
testing  for  radon  may  be  done  only  by  testers  licensed  by  a
state agency. According to the statute, a firm may be licensed
to test for radon only if it meets specified rigorous standards

96

relating  to  the  accuracy  of  its  testing.  These  standards  may
easily be achieved with current technology; but the technology
required  to  meet  them  is  50%  more  expensive  than  the
technology  required  to  measure  radon  accumulations  in  a
slightly less accurate manner.

The  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)
does  not  license  radon  testers.  However,  a  federal  statute
authorizes  the  EPA  to  advise  on  the  accuracy  of  various
methods of radon testing and to provide to the general public
a list of testers that use methods it believes to be reasonably
accurate.

WeTest,  a  recently  established  Magenta  firm,  uses  a  testing
method that the EPA has stated is reasonably accurate. WeTest
is  also  included  by  the  EPA  on  the  list  of  testers  using
methods  of  testing  it  believes  to  be  reasonably  accurate.
WeTest  applies  for  a  Magenta  radon  testing  license,  but  its
application is denied because WeTest cannot demonstrate that
the method of testing for radon it uses is sufficiently accurate
to meet the rigorous Magenta statutory standards. WeTest sues
appropriate  Magenta  officials  in  federal  court  claiming  that
Magenta  may  not  constitutionally  exclude  WeTest  from
performing the required radon tests in Magenta.
In this suit, the court will probably rule in favor of
(A)  WeTest, because the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the
Constitution requires Magenta to respect and give effect
to the action of the EPA in including WeTest on its list of
testers that use reasonably accurate methods.

if 

it  does  not  violate  any 

Answer  30:  The  correct  choice  is  (C).  The  question,  of
course,  is  whether  the  federal  regulation  on  radon  detectors
preempts  the  state  regulation.  The  issue  is  always  one  of
intent: If the federal government did not intend to preempt the
state,  or  to  occupy  the  entire  field,  then  the  state  regulation
will  survive 
independent
constitutional  prohibition.  Here,  there  are  strong  clues  that
neither  Congress  nor  the  EPA  intended  to  displace  more-
rigorous  state  regulation  of  radar  detection:  The  federal
government  has  not  chosen  to  actually  license  radon  testers,
and the EPA is merely purporting to give useful information to
the  public,  not  to  “regulate.”  Furthermore,  it  appears  that  a
radon tester can comply simultaneously with both the federal
“reasonably  accurate”  standard  and 
the  more-rigorous
Magenta standard. All of this justifies the conclusion that the
EPA’s  maintenance  of  its  reasonably-accurate-methods  list
was  not  intended  to  displace  more-rigorous  state  licensing
standards.
(A)  is  wrong  because  (among  other  reasons)  the  Full  Faith
and Credit Clause applies only to require a state to honor the
statutes  and  judgments  of  another  state,  not  those  of  the
federal government.

(B)  is  wrong  because,  for  the  reasons  described  above,  the
EPA’s  list  was  not  intended  to  displace  or  preempt  more-
rigorous  state  licensing  methods,  so  the  Supremacy  Clause
never came into action.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  what  is  being  regulated
cannot “move in interstate commerce” does not dispose of the
issue  of  whether  federal  regulation  has  preempted  the  state
regulation.  For  instance,  Congress  could  have  (but  did  not)
authorized  the  EPA  to  enact  radon-testing  regulations  that
would  displace  any  more-stringent  state  regulation;  in  doing
so  Congress  could  have  used  its  commerce  power  based  on
the  fact  that  radon  detectors  move  in  or  affect  interstate
commerce even though the basement areas being measured do
not themselves move in interstate commerce.

B.  Consent by Congress

98

Question  31:  A  state  legislature  conducted  an  investigation
into  a  series  of  fatal  accidents  in  the  state  involving
commercial  trucks  with  trailer  exteriors  made  of  polished
aluminum. The investigation revealed that the sun’s glare off
of  these  trucks  blinded  the  drivers  of  other  vehicles.  The
state’s legislature then enacted a law prohibiting commercial
trucks with polished aluminum trailer exteriors from traveling
on the state’s highways.

interstate 

Litigation over the state law resulted in a final decision by the
United  States  Supreme  Court  that  the  law  impermissibly
burdened 
therefore,  was
commerce 
unconstitutional.  Congress  later  enacted  a  statute  permitting
any  state  to  enact  a  law  regulating  the  degree  of  light
reflectiveness of the exteriors of commercial trucks using the
state’s highways.

and, 

Is this federal statute constitutional?

(A)    No,  because  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  already
determined  that  state  laws  of  this  type  impermissibly
burden interstate commerce.

(B)    No,  because  Article  III  vests  the  judicial  power  in  the
federal  courts,  the  essence  of  judicial  power  is  the
ability  to  render  a  final  judgment,  and  this  statute
overrules a final judgment of the federal Supreme Court.
(C)    Yes,  because  Article  I,  Section  8  grants  Congress
authority  to  enact  statutes  authorizing  states  to  impose
burdens on interstate commerce that would otherwise be
prohibited.

(D)    Yes,  because  Article  I,  Section  8  grants  Congress
authority  to  enact  statutes  for  the  general  welfare,  and
Congress  could  reasonably  believe  that  state  laws
regulating  the  light  reflectiveness  of  the  exteriors  of
trucks promote the general welfare.

Answer 31: Choice (C) is correct. Congress has the power to
consent  to  state  conduct  that  would,  in  the  absence  of
congressional consent, violate the dormant commerce clause.
That’s what has happened here. And the usual rule prohibiting
Congress  from  enacting  a  statute  overruling  a  constitutional
decision  of  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  does  not  apply  here:

99

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

Congress is not “overruling” the Court’s judgment, it’s simply
changing  the  law  for  future  cases,  which  is  an  action  that  is
within  the  legislative  power  of  Congress  and  that  doesn’t
encroach on the Court’s power to decide cases.

(A) is wrong because this is one area in which Congress may
reverse the impact of prior Supreme Court decisions. In many
areas  of  constitutional  law  (e.g.,  the  meaning  of  the  equal
protection, due process and free speech guarantees), Congress
does  not  have  power  to  prospectively  overrule  decisions  of
the  Supreme  Court.  But  that  is  not  true  of  the  Court’s
decisions in some other areas. In particular, Congress has the
power to authorize state conduct that would otherwise violate
the  dormant  commerce  clause,  and  the  fact  that  the  Supreme
Court  has  already  held  that  particular  state  conduct  violates
the dormant commerce clause does not negate this power.

(B) is wrong because it mischaracterizes what the statute did.
The  congressional  statute  permitting  any  state  to  regulate  the
degree of light reflectiveness of the exteriors of trucks using
the  state’s  highways  did  not  overrule  the  U.S.  Supreme
Court’s  judgment.  If  the  Court  had,  for  example,  awarded
damages  or  attorney’s  fees  to  the  prevailing  party  in  that
earlier  suit,  those  awards  would  remain  in  effect  after
Congress  enacted  the  statute,  and  Congress  would  not  have
had the power to reverse those litigant-specific outcomes. But
here,  Congress’s  statute  simply  changed  the  law  for  future
cases, which is an action that is within the legislative power
of Congress and that does not encroach on the Court’s judicial
power to decide cases within its jurisdiction.

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  relies  on  a  non-existent  source  of
congressional  power.  While  the  Constitution  gives  Congress
the  power  to  appropriate  money  to  promote  the  general
welfare  of  the  United  States  (i.e.,  to  “tax  and  spend”  for  the
general  welfare),  it  does  not  give  Congress  the  power
generally  to  enact  regulatory-type  statutes  on  the  basis  that
they promote the general welfare.
Since there is no taxing or spending being done by the statute
here, the concept of “general welfare” is irrelevant.

Question  32:  A  federal  statute  provides  that  the  cities  in

100

which certain specified airports are located may regulate the
rates and services of all limousines that serve those airports,
without  regard  to  the  origin  or  destination  of  the  passengers
who use the limousines.

The cities of Redville and Greenville are located adjacent to
each other in different states. The airport serving both of them
is located in Redville and is one of those airports specified in
the  federal  statute.  The  Redville  City  Council  has  adopted  a
rule that requires any limousines serving the airport to charge
only the rates authorized by the Redville City Council.

Airline  Limousine  Service  has  a 
lucrative  business
transporting passengers between Greenville and the airport in
Redville,  at  much  lower  rates  than  those  required  by  the
Redville  City  Council.  It  transports  passengers  in  interstate
traffic only; it does not provide local service within Redville.
The  new  rule  adopted  by  the  Redville  City  Council  will
require Airline Limousine Service to charge the same rates as
limousines operating only in Redville.

Must Airline Limousine Service comply with the new rule of
the Redville City Council?
(A)    Yes,  because  the  airport  is  located  in  Redville  and,
therefore,  its  city  council  has  exclusive  regulatory
authority over all transportation to and from the airport.

(B)    Yes,  because  Congress  has  authorized  this  form  of
regulation  by  Redville  and,  therefore,  removed  any
constitutional impediments to it that may have otherwise
existed.

(C)  No, because the rule would arbitrarily destroy a lucrative
existing  business  and,  therefore,  would  amount  to  a
taking without just compensation.

(D)    No,  because  Airline  Limousine  Service  is  engaged  in
interstate commerce and this rule is an undue burden on
that commerce.

Answer 32: The correct choice is (B). The Redville rule, by
requiring higher limo prices for interstate trips than would be
set by the market, might well be an undue burden on interstate
commerce  (and  thus  a  violation  of  the  dormant  commerce
clause) if there were no federal legislation on the subject. But

101

Congress has the power to allow state regulation that would
otherwise  violate  the  dormant  commerce  clause,  and  that’s
what  happened  here:  Congress  gave  the  city  containing  the
airport the right to set limo rates without respect to the rates’
effect on commerce, so there is no dormant commerce clause
problem.

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  incorrectly  explains  the  correct
result.  If  Congress  had  not  specifically  allowed  the  city  in
which  any  specified  airport  is  located  to  regulate  limos
serving that city, Redville would be acting unconstitutionally
by  burdening  interstate  commerce.  That  is,  as  a  general
principle  it  is  not  correct  to  say  that  a  city  has  exclusive
regulatory  authority  over  all  transportation  to  and  from  an
airport located within the city. (Under the dormant commerce
clause, no city or state may intentionally discriminate against,
or unduly burden, interstate commerce, even if that commerce
relates to a facility located within the city or state that’s doing
the  regulating.)  Only  the  special  congressional  authorization
validates the Redville regulation.

(C)  is  wrong  because  what  Redville  is  doing  here  is
regulating,  not  “taking.”  Only  if  a  regulation  destroys  all
economic value of a business will it be deemed to be a Fifth
Amendment  “taking”  for  which  compensation  must  be  paid.
And there’s no evidence that the regulation here will destroy
all  economic  value  of  the  plaintiff’s  business.  Furthermore,
even  in  the  exceptionally  unlikely  event  that  a  court  would
conclude  that  there  had  been  a  taking,  the  proper  remedy
would be an order that Redville pay “just compensation,” not
a decree holding the regulation itself invalid.

(D) is wrong because Congress has authorized the regulation
in question. If Congress had not expressly authorized the type
of  regulation  at  issue  here  (limo  rates  for  airport  traffic,
imposed by the city where the airport is located), this choice
would  likely  be  correct,  because  the  uniform-rate  regulation
probably would unduly burden (and discriminate against) out-
of-state-based limo companies. But Congress always has the
power  to  authorize  what  would  otherwise  be  a  violation  of
dormant-commerce-clause  principles,  and  that’s  what  it  has
done here.

102

Question 33:  The  United  States  Congress  enacted  a  federal
statute providing that any state may “require labeling to show
the  state  or  other  geographic  origin  of  citrus  fruit  that  is
imported  into  the  receiving  state.”  Pursuant  to  the  federal
statute,  a  state  that  produced  large  quantities  of  citrus  fruit
enacted a law requiring all citrus fruit imported into the state
to be stamped with a two-letter postal abbreviation signifying
the state of the fruit’s origin. The law did not impose any such
requirement  for  citrus  fruit  grown  within  the  state.  When  it
adopted the law, the state legislature declared that its purpose
was  to  reduce  the  risks  of  infection  of  local  citrus  crops  by
itinerant diseases that have been found to attack citrus fruit. A
national  association  of  citrus  growers  sued  to  have  the  state
law declared unconstitutional. The association claims that the
law  is  prohibited  by  the  negative  implications  of  the
Commerce Clause of the Constitution.

Which  of  the  following  is  the  best  argument  in  favor  of  the
state’s effort to have this lawsuit dismissed?

(A)  Any burden on interstate commerce imposed by the state

law is outweighed by a legitimate state interest.

(B)    Congress  has  the  authority  to  authorize  specified  state
regulations  that  would  otherwise  be  prohibited  by  the
negative  implications  of  the  Commerce  Clause,  and  it
has done so in this situation.

(C)    The  state  law  does  not  discriminate  against  out-of-state

citrus growers or producers.

(D)    The  state  law  furthers  a  legitimate  state  interest,  the
burden  it  imposes  on  interstate  commerce  is  only
incidental, and the state’s interest cannot be satisfied by
other  means  that  are  less  burdensome  to  interstate
commerce.

Answer  33:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  In  the  absence  of
congressional action, the state rule here probably would be a
violation of the dormant commerce clause (what the question
calls  the  “negative  implications  of  the  Commerce  Clause”),
because  it  discriminates  against  out-of-state  growers.  But
Congress  may  use  its  commerce  power  to  permit  states  to
discriminate  against  interstate  commerce.  The  federal  statute
here  explicitly  authorizes  states  to  enact  state-of-origin

103

labeling requirements on imported citrus fruit.

(A) is incorrect, because the balancing argument would work
only if: (1) Congress had not enacted a statute authorizing the
state  regulation  at  issue;  and  (2)  the  state  law  did  not
discriminate  against  interstate  commerce.  In  this  case,
however,  neither  of  these  conditions  is  satisfied:  Congress
has  authorized  state-of-origin 
labeling  requirements  on
imported citrus fruit, and the state law is discriminatory.

(C)  is  incorrect,  because  the  state  law  does  discriminate
against  out-of-state  citrus  growers,  in  that  the  law  requires
that all citrus fruit “imported” into the state be stamped with
the state of origin, while the law imposes no such requirement
on citrus fruit grown within the state.

(D)  is  incorrect,  because  although  this  argument  correctly
paraphrases  the  burden  on  the  state  to  justify  a  law  that
discriminates  against  interstate  commerce,  the  argument
would be less likely to succeed than the “Congress authorized
it”  argument:  In  the  absence  of  congressional  authorization,
the burden on a state to justify its discriminatory regulation is
a  heavy  one,  and  states  only  rarely  succeed  in  carrying  it.
Here, the availability of less-discriminatory alternatives (e.g.,
requiring in-state growers, not just out-of-staters, to stamp the
state’s two-letter code on the fruit) makes it unlikely that the
state would win with this argument.

CHAPTER 4
INTERGOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITIES;
INTERSTATE RELATIONS

I.    TAX AND REGULATORY IMMUNITIES

A.  Several types of immunities

1.  Federal immunity from state regulation

a.  Applies to generally-applicable rules

Question 34: A federally owned and operated office building
in the state of Red is heated with a new, pollution-free heating
system. However, in the coldest season of the year, this new
system is sometimes insufficient to supply adequate heat to the
building.  The  appropriation  statute  providing  the  money  for
construction  of  the  new  heating  system  permitted  use  of  the
old,  pollution-generating  system  when  necessary  to  supply
additional  heat.  When  the  old  heating  system  operates  (only
about  two  days  in  any  year),  the  smokestack  of  the  building
emits smoke that exceeds the state of Red’s pollution-control
standards.
May the operators of the federal office building be prosecuted
successfully  by  Red  authorities  for  violating  that  state’s
pollution control standards?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  regulation  of  pollution  is  a  legitimate

state police power concern.

(B)  Yes, because the regulation of pollution is a joint concern
of  the  federal  government  and  the  state  and,  therefore,
both of them may regulate conduct causing pollution.
(C)  No, because the operations of the federal government are
immune  from  state  regulation  in  the  absence  of  federal
consent.

(D)  No, because the violations of the state pollution-control
standards involved here are so de minimis that they are
beyond the legitimate reach of state law.

Answer  34:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  operations  of  the
federal government are indeed immune from state regulation,

105

no  matter  how  reasonable  the  state  regulation,  and  even
though the regulation is a generally-applicable one that treats
the federal government no differently than anyone else. Since
the  office  building  is  owned  by  and  operated  by  the  federal
government, this regulatory immunity applies.

(A) is wrong, because even though the regulation of pollution
may  be  a  legitimate  state  police  power  concern,  that
regulation must give way to federal regulatory immunity.

(B) is wrong because, even if regulation of pollution is a joint
concern of the federal and state governments, and even though
both  governments  can  regulate  private  parties  (assuming  that
the  state  regulation  is  not  inconsistent  with  the  federal
regulation),  it  does  not  follow  that  the  state  can  regulate  the
federal  government — under  the  principles  of  regulatory
immunity, the state cannot do so.

(D)  is  wrong  because  there  is  no  “de  minimis”  exception  to
the principle that states may regulate pursuant to their inherent
police power. (The sole problem here is the federal immunity
from regulation, which applies whether the asserted violation
of the state’s regulation is de minimis or not.)

Question  35:  The  United  States  Department  of  Energy
regularly  transports  nuclear  materials  through  Centerville  on
the way to a nuclear weapons processing plant it operates in a
nearby  state.  The  city  of  Centerville  recently  adopted  an
ordinance  prohibiting  the  transportation  of  any  nuclear
materials  in  or  through  the  city.  The  ordinance  declares  that
its purpose is to protect the health and safety of the residents
of that city.

May  the  Department  of  Energy  continue  to  transport  these
nuclear materials through the city of Centerville?
(A)    No,  because  the  ordinance  is  rationally  related  to  the

public health and safety of Centerville residents.

(B)  No, because the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states

certain unenumerated sovereign powers.

(C)    Yes,  because  the  Department  of  Energy  is  a  federal
agency  engaged  in  a  lawful  federal  function  and,
therefore,  its  activities  may  not  be  regulated  by  a  local
government without the consent of Congress.

106

(D)    Yes,  because  the  ordinance  enacted  by  Centerville  is
invalid  because  it  denies  persons  transporting  such
materials the equal protection of the laws.

Answer 35: Choice (C) is correct — the federal government,
including  the  operations  of  federal  agencies,  are  essentially
immune from state regulation. Notice that the answer does not
use  the  word  “immunity” — it’s  up  to  you  to  recognize  that
when  the  choice  says  “may  not  be  regulated,”  what’s  being
referred to is the concept of immunity.

(A)  is  incorrect,  because  of  federal  immunity;  note  that  if
there were no federal immunity involved (e.g., the entity being
regulated was a private company pursuing its own interests),
this  choice  would  be  correct,  at  least  if  the  regulation  were
challenged on equal protection grounds.

(B) is wrong because the Tenth Amendment has no relevance
here.  The  Tenth  Amendment  does  not  restrict  the  powers  of
the federal government as long as the latter is not purporting
to  require  the  state  to  enact  laws  or  regulations.  Here,  the
Dept.  of  Energy  isn’t  requiring  the  state  to  enact  a  federal
regulatory  program — the  DOE  is  merely  pursuing  its  own
regulatory  program.  And  the  Tenth  Amendment  doesn’t  limit
DOE’s ability to do that.

(D) is wrong because the Equal Protection Clause would not
invalidate  this  ordinance.  The  ordinance  is  an  economic
regulation, and clearly satisfies the applicable rational-basis
test  (see  the  discussion  of  Choice  (A)  above).  It’s  only
federal  immunity  from  state  regulation  that  causes  the
ordinance not to be enforceable against the DOE’s activities.

II.   THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE

A.  How tested on the MBE

1.  Effect of Clause

a.  Collection of money judgments

Question 36: The state of Red sent three of its employees to a
city  located  in  the  state  of  Blue  to  consult  with  a  chemical
laboratory there about matters of state business. While in the
course  of  their  employment,  the  three  employees  of  Red

107

negligently  released  into  local  Blue  waterways  some  of  the
chemical  samples  they  had  received  from  the  laboratory  in
Blue.

Persons in Blue injured by the release of the chemicals sued
the  three  Red  state  employees  and  the  state  of  Red  in  Blue
state  courts  for  the  damages  they  suffered.  After  a  trial  in
which all of the defendants admitted jurisdiction of the Blue
state  court  and  fully  participated,  plaintiffs  received  a
judgment  against  all  of  the  defendants  for  $5  million,  which
became final.

Subsequently,  plaintiffs  sought  to  enforce  their  Blue  state
court  judgment  by  commencing  a  proper  proceeding  in  an
appropriate court of Red. In that enforcement proceeding, the
state  of  Red  argued,  as  it  had  done  unsuccessfully  in  the
earlier action in Blue state court, that its liability is limited by
a law of Red to $100,000 in any tort case. Because the three
individual employees of Red are able to pay only $50,000 of
the  judgment,  the  only  way  the  injured  persons  can  fully
satisfy their Blue state court judgment is from the funds of the
state of Red.
Can the injured persons recover the full balance of their Blue
state court judgment from the state of Red in the enforcement
proceeding they filed in a court of Red?
(A)    Yes,  because  the  final  judgment  of  the  Blue  court  is
entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of Red.
(B)  Yes, because a limitation on damage awards against Red
for tortious actions of its agents would violate the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(C)  No, because the Tenth Amendment preserves the right of a
state to have its courts enforce the state’s public policy
limiting its tort liability.

(D)    No,  because  the  employees  of  Red  were  negligent  and,
therefore,  their  actions  were  not  authorized  by  the  state
of Red.

Answer 36: Choice (A)  is  correct.  The  Blue  court  issued  a
valid judgment against the plaintiffs. Therefore, the Red state
court  was  required  by  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause  to
enforce that judgment, even though the only solvent defendant

108

in  the  Blue  proceeding  is  the  state  of  Red  itself.  The
constitutional  requirement  of  Full  Faith  and  Credit  does  not
recognize  any  exception  just  because  the  state  in  which
enforcement  is  sought  happens  to  itself  be  the  defendant
against which the original judgment was issued. (By the way,
it’s  important  that  all  the  defendants  admitted  jurisdiction  in
the  original  Blue  proceedings — if  the  Blue  courts  had  not
had  jurisdiction,  the  defendants  could  make  a  “collateral
attack”  on  the  original  judgment  in  Red  court,  and  full  faith
and credit would not have applied.)

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  gives  an  incorrect  reason  for  the
current  result.  A  state  may,  without  violating  the  Equal
Protection Clause, cap (or even abolish entirely) its liability
for torts by its employees or agents. The correct reason Red
must pay the judgment is as given in (A).

(C) is wrong because (1) although a state does, as a general
rule, have the right to enforce a public policy limiting its tort
liability, this right does not derive from the Tenth Amendment;
and (2) in any event, a state’s obligation to enforce an out-of-
state  judgment  under  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause  takes
priority over the state’s own public policy, at least where the
out-of-state judgment came after all defendants had a full and
fair opportunity to litigate in a court that had jurisdiction over
them.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  Red  courts  must  enforce  the  Blue
court’s  judgment,  regardless  of  whether  a  Red  court  would
have  reached  the  same  conclusion  on  the  merits  as  the  Blue
court  did  about  whether  Red  as  employer  is  liable  for  these
torts by its agents.

b.  First state’s error of law

Question 37: A man bought an antique car from a car dealer
in State A. Under State A law, a person who buys from such a
dealer  acquires  good  title,  even  if  the  property  was  stolen
from a previous owner. The man showed the car at an antique
car  show  in  State  B.  A  woman  recognized  the  car  as  having
been  stolen  from  her.  Under  State  B  law,  a  person  whose
property  is  stolen  may  reclaim  it,  even  if  the  current
possessor is an innocent purchaser. The woman sued the man

109

in  a  State  B  court  to  reclaim  the  car.  The  man  defended,
claiming  that  he  had  good  title  under  the  law  of  State  A.
Nevertheless, the State B court applied State B law, and the
woman prevailed.  The  man  did  not  appeal.  The  sheriff  gave
the  woman  possession  of  the  car.  Several  months  later,  the
woman drove the car to State A. The man brought a new suit
against the woman, claiming that the State B court in the prior
suit  should  have  applied  the  State  A  law,  which  protected
innocent  purchasers.  The  woman  appeared  and  moved  to
dismiss the suit.

What should the State A court do?

(A)  Apply the federal law of sale of goods, because the car

has moved in interstate commerce.

(B)    Apply  the  State  A  law,  because  the  car  is  currently

located in State A.

(C)  Dismiss the suit, because the State A court must give full

faith and credit to the State B judgment.

(D)    Remove  the  case  to  federal  court,  because  the  car  has
moved  in  interstate  commerce,  and  therefore  the  case
raises a federal question.

Answer 37: Choice (C)  is  correct.  The  Full  Faith  &  Credit
(FF&C) Clause prohibits state courts from re-litigating cases
in  which  the  courts  of  another  state  have  rendered  final
judgment.  Even  if  the  first  court  should  have  applied  the
second court’s laws under standard conflict rules, the FF&C
Clause bars the second court from re-hearing the case. (If the
State B courts had not had jurisdiction over the man, and the
jurisdiction issue had not been litigated or waived, the FF&C
Clause might not bar the State A courts from hearing the new
suit.  But  the  facts  tell  us  that  the  man  “defended”  on  the
merits,  thus  waiving  any  claim  he  might  have  had  that  the
State B courts lacked jurisdiction over him.) Accordingly, the
court in State A was required to dismiss the suit.
(A) is incorrect, because the FF&C Clause prevents the court
in  State  A  from  re-litigating  the  merits,  and  the  fact  that  the
woman  drove  the  car  to  State  A  has  no  effect  on  the
constitutional analysis.
(B) is, similarly, wrong because the location of the car has no

110

effect on the constitutional analysis.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  movement  of  the  car  across  state
lines did not create a federal question.

CHAPTER 5
THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE

I.    SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS — ECONOMIC

AND SOCIAL WELFARE REGULATION

A.  Economic and social welfare regulation

1.  Easy to satisfy

Question 38: A state statute requires each insurance company
that offers burglary insurance policies in the state to charge a
uniform rate for such insurance to all of its customers residing
within  the  same  county  in  that  state.  So  long  as  it  complies
with  this  requirement,  a  company  is  free  to  charge  whatever
rate the market will bear for its burglary insurance policies.

An insurance company located in the state files suit in federal
district  court  against  appropriate  state  officials  to  challenge
this statute on constitutional grounds. The insurance company
wishes to charge customers residing within the same county in
the  state  rates  for  burglary  insurance  policies  that  will  vary
because  they  would  be  based  on  the  specific  nature  of  the
customer’s  business,  on  its  precise  location,  and  on  its  past
claims record.

In this suit, the court should

(A)    hold  the  statute  unconstitutional,  because  the  statute
deprives the insurance company of its liberty or property
without due process of law.

(B)    hold  the  statute  unconstitutional,  because  the  statute
imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.
(C)    hold  the  statute  constitutional,  because  the  statute  is  a

reasonable exercise of the state’s police power.

(D)    abstain  from  ruling  on  the  merits  of  this  case  until  the
state  courts  have  had  an  opportunity  to  pass  on  the
constitutionality of this state statute.

Answer  38:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  This  is  a  classic
illustration  of  a  state  regulation  in  the  economic  or  social-
welfare  area,  where  no  fundamental  right  is  involved.

112

(Insurers  don’t  have  a  fundamental  right  to  adopt  any
particular  pricing  mechanism.)  Since  the  “one  price  for  all”
scheme  is  rationally  related  to  achieving  one  or  more
legitimate state objectives (e.g., promoting a sense of fairness
and non-discrimination among insurance customers living in a
particular  county,  or  avoiding  race-based  redlining),  the
scheme does not violate the insurer’s due process rights.

(A) is wrong for the same reason (C) is right — the company
may have a due process right not to be irrationally deprived
of  its  desired  pricing  mechanism,  but  the  requirement  of
uniform pricing here is not irrational.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  the  statute  does  not  unduly  burden
interstate  commerce  (it  only  applies  to  policies  written  in-
state,  and  it  does  not  discriminate  against  out-of-state
insurers).

(D)  is  wrong  because  federal  courts  do  not  have  a  duty  to
abstain  from  passing  on  the  case  until  the  state  courts  have
had an opportunity to pass on the constitutionality of this state
statute. When a litigant believes that a state statute violates the
federal  Constitution,  the  litigant  may  sue  immediately  in
federal court for a determination that this is so, as long as the
requirements  of  justiciability  (e.g.,  ripeness,  actual  injury  to
the plaintiff, etc.) are met. In other words, there is no sense in
which  state  courts  get  “first  shot”  to  determine  the  federal
constitutionality of a state statute.

II.   SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS — 

REGULATIONS AFFECTING FUNDAMENTAL
RIGHTS

A.  Abortion

1.  Consent

a.  Parental consent

i.  Emancipation or maturity

Question 39: A state statute requires, without exception, that
a woman under the age of 18 notify one of her parents at least
48  hours  before  having  an  abortion.  A  proper  lawsuit

113

challenges the constitutionality of this state statute.

In that suit, should the court uphold the constitutionality of the
statute?

(A)  No, because a 48-hour waiting period is excessively long
and, therefore, it imposes an undue burden on a woman’s
right to procure an abortion.

(B)    No,  because  the  state  law  does  not  provide  a  bypass
procedure that would allow a court to authorize a minor
to obtain an abortion without prior parental notification
under appropriate circumstances.

(C)    Yes,  because  parents’  rights  to  supervise  their  minor
daughter’s health care outweighs any individual right she
may have.

(D)    Yes,  because  such  parental  notification  and  waiting-
period requirements do not impose an undue burden on a
minor’s right to procure an abortion.

Answer  39:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  Supreme  Court  has
held  that  parental  notification  requirements  constitute  an
undue burden on the minor’s right to abortion, and thus violate
the minor’s substantive right to due process, unless there is a
satisfactory judicial bypass procedure. Such a procedure must
allow  a  court  to  approve  an  abortion  for  a  minor  without
parental notification if the court finds either that: (1) the minor
is  sufficiently  mature  and  informed  to  make  an  independent
decision to obtain an abortion; or (2) the abortion would be in
the  minor’s  best  interest.  Because  no  such  bypass  procedure
is  included  in  the  statute  at  issue,  the  court  will  hold  the
statute unconstitutional.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  although  it  is  true  that  the  statute  at
issue  is  unconstitutional,  this  answer  misstates  the  basis  for
this  conclusion — the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  a  short
waiting  period  does  not  constitute  an  undue  burden  on  a
woman’s right to an abortion.
(C) is incorrect, because the rights of parents to supervise the
health care of their minor children do not always prevail over
the individual rights of their children — as discussed above,
the  Court  has  held  that  parental  notification  requirements
violate  a  minor’s  right  to  an  abortion  unless  there  is  a

114

satisfactory judicial bypass procedure, which is not included
in the statute at issue.

(D)  is  incorrect,  because  the  Court  has  held  that  parental
notification  requirements  are  an  undue  burden,  and  violate  a
minor’s  right  to  an  abortion,  unless  there  is  a  satisfactory
judicial bypass procedure.

2.  Public funding

Question 40: A state statute prohibits the use of state-owned
or  state-operated  facilities  for  the  performance  of  abortions
that  are  not  “necessary  to  save  the  life  of  the  mother.”  That
statute  also  prohibits  state  employees  from  performing  any
such  abortions  during  the  hours  they  are  employed  by  the
state.

A woman was in her second month of pregnancy. She sought
an abortion at a state-owned and state-operated hospital. The
woman  did  not  claim  that  the  requested  abortion  was
necessary  to  save  her  life.  The  officials  in  charge  of  the
hospital  refused  to  perform  the  requested  abortion  solely  on
the  basis  of  the  state  statute.  The  woman  immediately  filed
suit  against  those  officials  in  an  appropriate  federal  district
court.  She  challenged  the  constitutionality  of  the  state  statute
and  requested  the  court  to  order  the  hospital  to  perform  the
abortion she sought. In this case, the court will probably hold
that the state statute is

(A)    unconstitutional,  because  a  limit  on  the  availability  of
abortions  performed  by  state  employees  or  in  state-
owned or state-operated facilities to situations in which
the  mother
it 
impermissibly  interferes  with  the  fundamental  right  of
the woman to decide whether to have a child.

is  necessary 

to  save 

life  of 

the 

(B)    unconstitutional,  because  it  impermissibly  discriminates
against  poor  persons  who  cannot  afford  to  pay  for
abortions in privately owned and operated facilities and
against persons who live far away from privately owned
and operated abortion clinics.

(C)  constitutional, because it does not prohibit a woman from
having  an  abortion  or  penalize  her  for  doing  so,  it  is
rationally related to the legitimate governmental goal of

115

encouraging childbirth, and it does not unduly burden the
voluntary  performance  of  abortions  by  private
physicians in private facilities.

(D)    constitutional,  because  the  use  of  state-owned  or  state-
operated  facilities  and  access  to  the  services  of  state
employees are privileges and not rights and, therefore, a
state may condition them on any basis it chooses.

in  abortions,  without 

Answer 40: Choice (C) is correct. The Court held in Webster
v.  Reproductive  Health  Services  (1989)  that  a  state  could
constitutionally  forbid  the  use  of  all  public  facilities  and
publicly-employed  staff 
thereby
violating the substantive due process right to abortion. If the
state forbade all facilities in the state — public or private — 
from performing abortions, that would be an unconstitutional
“undue  burden”  on  abortion,  but  the  availability  of  private-
facility  abortions  here  prevents  an  undue  burden  from
occurring. And the fact that the state here is allowing the use
of  public  facilities  for  those  abortions  necessary  to  save  the
life of the mother makes it even more clear that the regulation
is constitutional. (Probably under Webster such an exception
is not even required.)

(A) is wrong because the Court has held (in Webster, supra)
that the availability of private-facility abortions means that a
ban  on  the  use  of  public  facilities  does  not  impermissibly
interfere with the right of abortion.

(B) is wrong because the Court has held (in Harris v. McRae
(1980))  that  government’s  refusal  to  fund  abortions  for
patients  who  cannot  afford  them  does  not  constitute  an
to
interference  with 
abortion.

the  constitutionally-protected  right 

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  Court  no  longer  uses  the
privilege/right  distinction  in  deciding  cases  involving  the
exercise  of  the  important  constitutional  interests,  and  it  is
certainly  not  the  case  that  the  state  may  condition  access  to
public  facilities  for  an  abortion  “on  any  basis  it  chooses.”
(For  instance,  the  state  could  not  say  that  it  will  fund
abortions  at  state-owned  facilities  for  white  women  but  not
black women.)

III.  PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS

A.  Process required

1.  Time for hearing

Question 41: A state statute declares that after five years of
continuous  service  in  their  positions  all  state  employees,
including faculty members at the state university, are entitled
to  retain  their  positions  during  “good  behavior.”  The  statute
also  contains  a  number  of  procedural  provisions.  Any  state
employee  who  is  dismissed  after  that  five-year  period  must
be  given  reasons  for  the  dismissal  before  it  takes  effect.  In
addition,  such  an  employee  must,  upon  request,  be  granted  a
post-dismissal hearing before an administrative board to seek
reinstatement  and  back  pay.  The  statute  precludes  any  other
hearing  or  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  charges.  That  post-
dismissal  hearing  must  occur  within  six  months  after  the
dismissal takes effect. The burden of proof at such a hearing
is on the state, and the board may uphold the dismissal only if
it  is  supported  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence.  An
employee  who  is  dissatisfied  with  a  decision  of  the  board
after a hearing may appeal its decision to the state courts. The
provisions of this statute are inseverable.

A  teacher  who  had  been  employed  continuously  for  seven
years  as  a  faculty  member  at  the  state  university  was
dismissed. A week before the dismissal took effect, she was
informed  that  she  was  being  dismissed  because  of  a  charge
that she accepted a bribe from a student in return for raising
the  student’s  final  grade  in  her  course.  At  that  time  she
requested an immediate hearing to contest the propriety of her
dismissal.
Three  months  after  her  dismissal,  she  was  granted  a  hearing
before  the  state  administrative  board.  The  board  upheld  her
dismissal,  finding  that  the  charge  against  her  was  supported
by a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing.
The  faculty  member  did  not  appeal  the  decision  of  the  state
administrative board to the state courts. Instead, she sought a
declaratory judgment in federal district court to the effect that
the  state  statute  prescribing  the  procedures  for  her  dismissal

117

is unconstitutional.

In this case, the federal district court should

(A)    dismiss  the  suit,  because  a  claim  that  a  state  statute  is
unconstitutional is not ripe for adjudication by a federal
court until all judicial remedies in state courts provided
for by state law have been exhausted.

(B)  hold the statute unconstitutional, because the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a state to
the  facts
demonstrate  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt 
constituting  good  cause  for  termination  of  a  state
employee.

(C)  hold the statute unconstitutional, because a state may not
ordinarily deprive an employee of a property interest in
a  job  without  giving  the  employee  an  opportunity  for
some  kind  of  pre-dismissal  hearing  to  respond  to  the
charges against that employee.

(D)    hold  the  statute  constitutional,  because  the  Due  Process
Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  entitles  state
employees  who  have  a  right  to  their  jobs  during  good
behavior  only  to  a  statement  of  reasons  for  their
dismissal  and  an  opportunity  for  a  post-dismissal
hearing.

Answer 41: Choice (C) is correct. Since the government had
previously  agreed  that  the  teacher  could  only  be  fired  if  she
were shown not to have had “good behavior,” she had a due
process  “property”  interest  in  maintaining  her  job.  The
Supreme  Court  has  held  that  once  a  person  has  a  property
interest  in  a  job  or  benefit,  only  the  courts,  not  the
government, may prescribe the procedures that are to be used
to  terminate  that  job  or  benefit.  So  the  fact  that  the  statute
provides only for a post-discharge hearing does not mean that
this is all that the teacher is due. Instead, the Court has held
that  the  job  holder  is  entitled  to  a  hearing  before  the
termination  (or  at  least  before  the  termination  of  salary).
Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill (1985). Since the statute
here did not give the teacher such a pre-termination hearing,
the  statute  was  unconstitutional.  And  the  statute  did  not  get
saved  by  the  government’s  holding  a  hearing  three  months
after the termination.

118

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  is  not  true  that  a  claim  that  a  state
statute  is  unconstitutional  is  not  ripe  until  all  state-court
remedies have been exhausted. When a litigant believes that a
state statute violates the federal Constitution, the litigant may
sue immediately in federal court for a determination that this
is  so,  as  long  as  the  requirements  of  justiciability  are  met.
And  although  it’s  true  that  one  of  the  requirements  of
justiciability is that the case be “ripe,” ripeness merely means
that  the  plaintiff  has  already  suffered,  or  imminently  faces,
actual injury.

(B)  is  wrong  for  at  least  two  reasons:  (1)  not  all  state
employees have the right not to be dismissed except for good
cause  (and  this  choice  implies  that  all  of  them  do);  and  (2)
even if an employee such as the teacher here had a right not to
be  dismissed  except  for  good  cause,  the  burden  of  proof  on
the  government  would  be  just  a  preponderance-of-the-
evidence  standard,  not 
the  hard-to-satisfy  “beyond  a
reasonable doubt” standard.

(D) is wrong because the Supreme Court has held that, where
a  state  employee  has  a  right  to  hold  her  job  during  good
behavior, the employee is entitled not only to a pre-dismissal
statement of reasons but a pre-dismissal hearing (and the fact
that  the  statute  provides  only  for  a  post-dismissal  hearing
does  not  change  the  constitutional  requirement  of  a  pre-
dismissal one). Cf. Loudermill, supra.

CHAPTER 6
EQUAL PROTECTION

I.    ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LAWS —  THE

“MERE RATIONALITY” TEST

A.  Non-suspect, non-fundamental rights (economic and social

legislation)

1.  “Grandfather clause” as rational classification

Question 42:  A  city  has  had  a  severe  traffic  problem  on  its
streets.  As  a  result,  it  enacted  an  ordinance  prohibiting  all
sales  to  the  public  of  food  or  other  items  by  persons  selling
directly  from  trucks,  cars,  or  other  vehicles  located  on  city
streets.  The  ordinance  included  an  inseverable  grandfather
provision exempting from its prohibition vendors who, for 20
years  or  more,  have  continuously  sold  food  or  other  items
from such vehicles located on the streets of the city.

A retail ice cream vendor qualifies for this exemption and is
the  only  food  vendor  that  does.  A  yogurt  company  is  a
business  similar  to  the  ice  cream  company,  but  the  yogurt
company  has  been  selling  to  the  public  directly  from  trucks
located  on  the  streets  of  the  city  only  for  the  past  ten  years.
The  yogurt  company  filed  suit  in  an  appropriate  federal
district  court  to  enjoin  enforcement  of  this  ordinance  on  the
ground that it denies the yogurt company the equal protection
of the laws.

In this case, the court will probably rule that the ordinance is
(A)    constitutional,  because  it  is  narrowly  tailored  to
implement  the  city’s  compelling  interest  in  reducing
traffic  congestion  and,  therefore,  satisfies  the  strict
scrutiny test applicable to such cases.

(B)    constitutional,  because  its  validity  is  governed  by  the
rational  basis  test,  and  the  courts  consistently  defer  to
economic  choices  embodied  in  such  legislation  if  they
are even plausibly justifiable.

(C)  unconstitutional, because the nexus between the legitimate

120

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

purpose of the ordinance and the conduct it prohibits is
so tenuous and its provisions are so underinclusive that
the ordinance fails to satisfy the substantial relationship
test applicable to such cases.

(D)    unconstitutional,  because  economic  benefits  or  burdens
imposed  by  legislatures  on  the  basis  of  grandfather
provisions  have  consistently  been  declared  invalid  by
courts  as  per  se  violations  of  the  Equal  Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Answer 42: Choice (B) is correct. The city here is engaging
in  economic  regulation,  and  no  suspect  class  or  fundamental
right is involved. The “even plausibly justifiable” standard is
a good summary of the extreme deference that courts give to
government choices in the economic-regulatory area where no
suspect  class  or  fundamental  right  is  at  issue.  Grandfather
schemes  in  which  people  with  longtime  track  records  of
pursuing  an  activity  are 
than
newcomers  to  that  activity  are  a  good  illustration  of
classifications that are very likely to be upheld.

treated  more  favorably 

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  incorrectly  applies  strict  scrutiny;
strict  scrutiny  would  be  appropriate  for  a  regulation  that
intentionally  disfavored  a  suspect  class  (e.g.,  persons  of  a
particular race) or substantially impaired a fundamental right
(e.g., the right to vote), but the classification here does not do
either of these things.

(C) is wrong because the grandfather scheme here would not
be found to be so “tenuous” or “underinclusive” as to fail the
easy-to-satisfy rational-basis test.

(D)  is  wrong  as  a  statement  of  law;  so  long  as  no  suspect
class or fundamental right is impaired, grandfather clauses are
usually found valid, and are certainly not “per se violations”
of equal protection.

2.  Non-suspect classes

a.  Status as convicted criminal

Question 43:  A  city  zoning  ordinance  requires  anyone  who
proposes  to  operate  a  group  home  to  obtain  a  special  use
permit  from  the  city  zoning  board.  The  zoning  ordinance
defines  a  group  home  as  a  residence  in  which  four  or  more

121

unrelated  adults  reside.  An  individual  applied  for  a  special
use permit to operate a group home for convicts during their
transition  from  serving  prison  sentences  to  their  release  on
parole.  Although  the  proposed  group  home  met  all  of  the
requirements  for  the  special  use  permit,  the  zoning  board
denied  the  individual’s  application  because  of  the  nature  of
the  proposed  use.  The  individual  sued  the  zoning  board
seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  on  constitutional
grounds.

Which of the following best states the appropriate burden of
persuasion in this action?

(A)  Because housing is a fundamental right, the zoning board
must demonstrate that denial of the permit is necessary to
serve a compelling state interest.

(B)    Because  the  zoning  board’s  action  has  the  effect  of
discriminating against a quasi-suspect class in regard to
a  basic  subsistence  right,  the  zoning  board  must
demonstrate that the denial of the permit is substantially
related to an important state interest.
invidiously
the  zoning  board’s  action 
  Because 
discriminates  against  a  suspect  class,  the  zoning  board
must demonstrate that denial of the permit is necessary to
serve a compelling state interest.

(C) 

(D)  Because the zoning board’s action is in the nature of an
economic  or  social  welfare  regulation,  the  individual
seeking the permit must demonstrate that the denial of the
permit  is  not  rationally  related  to  a  legitimate  state
interest.

Answer  43:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Note  that  the  only
plausible ground for plaintiff’s attack is the Equal Protection
Clause — government is saying that certain groups of four or
more  people  can  live  together  without  a  permit  and  others
can’t.  Persons  convicted  of  crimes  have  not  been  held  to
constitute  either  a  suspect  or  a  quasi-suspect  class  for  equal
protection  purposes.  Therefore,  the  zoning  board’s  denial  of
the permit discriminated against neither a suspect class nor a
quasi-suspect class. Nor did it unduly burden the exercise of a
fundamental  right  (since  housing  has  not  been  held  to  be  a
fundamental  right  for  equal  protection  purposes).  The  denial

122

therefore triggers rational basis scrutiny.

(A)  is  wrong  because  housing  has  been  held  not  to  be  a
fundamental  right  for  equal  protection  purposes.  Lindsey  v.
Normet  (1972).  Therefore,  the  strict  scrutiny  standard
articulated in this choice would not be appropriate.

(B) is wrong because convicts have never been held to be a
semi-suspect  class. 
semi-suspect  classes
(The  only 
recognized by the Court to date are gender and illegitimacy.)
Nor does housing have any special equal protection status as
a  “basic  subsistence  right.”  Therefore,  the  intermediate
standard of review (which this choice correctly describes as
the  “substantially  related  to  an  important  state  interest”  test)
would not apply here.

(C)  is  wrong  because  convicts  do  not  constitute  a  suspect
class  for  equal  protection  purposes.  Therefore,  while  this
would  be  the  correct  test  if  the  legislative  classification
involved  a  suspect  class  (e.g.,  race  or  national  origin),  it  is
not the correct test for this case.

II.   SUSPECT CLASSIFICATIONS, ESPECIALLY

RACE

A.  Suspect classifications

1.   Race

Question  44:  The  United  States  government  demonstrated
that  terrorist  attacks  involving  commercial  airliners  were
perpetrated exclusively by individuals of one particular race.
In  response,  Congress  enacted  a  statute  imposing  stringent
new airport and airline security measures only on individuals
of that race seeking to board airplanes in the United States.
Which  of  the  following  provides  the  best  ground  for
challenging the constitutionality of this statute?
(A)  The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8.
(B)  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
(C)  The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.
(D)    The  Privileges  or  Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth

Amendment.

123

Answer 44: Choice (B) is correct. What makes this question
slightly challenging is that you’re expecting a choice that uses
the  phrase  “equal  protection”  (since  the  government  is
treating  members  of  one  race  differently  than  those  of  other
races). But the key is that the way equal protection principles
apply to the federal government is via the Fifth Amendment’s
Due Process Clause — the Supreme Court held, in Bolling v.
Sharpe  (1954),  that  the  equal  protection  principles  of  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  apply  to  actions  of  the  federal
government  through  incorporation  into  the  Due  Process
Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment.  The  new  security  measures
presumptively violate equal protection because they contain a
racial  classification:  The  new  measures  apply  only  to
individuals  of  one  race.  A  court  therefore  would  uphold  the
measures  only  if  the  government  could  prove  that  they  are
necessary  to  serve  a  compelling  public  interest,  a  standard
that the government typically cannot meet and would be very
unlikely to meet here.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  statute  here  would  be  a  proper
exercise of the commerce power, if it did not violate the Due
Process  Clause.  The  Commerce  Clause  grants  Congress
plenary  power  to  regulate  the  safety  of  air  travel  because
airlines are instrumentalities of interstate commerce.

(Instead,  the  problem  is  that  the  new  security  measures
presumptively violate equal protection, as made applicable to
the states via the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. See
Choice (B) for more details.)

(C) is wrong because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of
Article  IV  prohibits  only  actions  by  states  that  improperly
discriminate  against  the  citizens  of  other  states.  The  Clause
does not apply to actions of the federal government.
(D) is wrong because the Privileges or Immunities Clause of
the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibits  states  from  depriving
individuals  of  the  privileges  or  immunities  of  United  States
citizenship.  The  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  never  applied  the
Clause to actions of the federal government.
(Furthermore, even where state rather than federal action is at
issue,  be  skeptical  of  any  choice  that  finds  a  governmental

124

action  unconstitutional  on  the  grounds  that  it  violates  the
Fourteenth Amendment P&I Clause. That Clause protects only
the privileges and immunities of “national citizenship.” There
immunities  of  national
are  very  few  privileges  and 
citizenship, mainly the right to vote in national elections, the
right to travel physically from state to state, and the right not
to be discriminated against by virtue of one’s having recently
moved to the state from a different state.)

2.  Purposeful discrimination

a.  Peremptory jury challenges

to 

to  call  attention 

Question  45:  The  executive  director  of  an  equal  housing
opportunity  organization  was  the  leader  of  a  sit-in  at  the
offices of a real estate management company. The protest was
the  company’s  racially
designed 
discriminatory  rental  practices.  When  police  demanded  that
the  director  desist  from  trespassing  on  the  company’s
property,  she  refused  and  was  arrested.  In  her  trial  for
trespass, the prosecution peremptorily excused all non-whites
from the jury, arguing to the court that even though the director
was  white,  minority  groups  would  automatically  support  her
because  of  her 
in  housing
accommodations.

racism 

fight 

If  the  director  is  convicted  of  trespass  by  an  all-white  jury
and appeals, claiming a violation of her constitutional rights,
the court should

(A)    affirm  the  conviction,  because  the  director  was  not  a

member of the class discriminated against.

(B)    affirm  the  conviction,  because  peremptory  challenge  of
the  non-whites  did  not  deny  the  director  the  right  to  an
impartial jury.
the  conviction,  because  racially  based
  reverse 
peremptory  challenges  violate  equal  protection  of  the
law.

(C) 

(D)  reverse the conviction, because the director was denied
the right to have her case heard by a fair cross-section of
the community.

Answer 45: Choice (C) is correct, because the prosecution’s
dismissal  of  jurors  solely  on  racial  grounds  violates  the

125

defendant’s  equal  protection  rights.  A  state  may  not  permit
litigants  (including  litigants  who  are  state  actors,  such  as
prosecutors) to exclude jurors based solely on racial grounds.
This  constitutes  a  violation  of  the  other  litigant’s  equal
protection rights. Batson v. Ky. (1986). And that’s especially
true where the exclusion is based upon the reasoning that “the
jurors would decide the case solely on racial considerations,”
as the prosecution is claiming here.

(A)  is  wrong,  because  the  director’s  race  wouldn’t  matter.
Prosecutors  may  not  use  peremptory  challenges  to  dismiss
potential jurors based solely on the race of the juror. (See the
discussion  of  choice  C  above.)  That’s  true  regardless  of
whether  the  litigant  who  is  raising  the  equal  protection
argument (here, the director) is or isn’t a member of the race
being discriminated against.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  the  use  of  peremptory  challenges  to
dismiss  potential  jurors  based  solely  on  the  juror’s  race  is
automatically deemed to be a denial of an impartial jury. The
use of peremptory challenges based solely on the race of the
potential  jurors  violates  equal  protection.  Batson  v.  Ky.,
supra.  The  litigant  who  is  objecting  to  the  practice  doesn’t
have to make a specific showing that this exclusion denied her
an  impartial  jury — the  mere  fact  of  intentional  exclusion
suffices to create an equal protection violation.

(D) is wrong, because “fair cross-section of the community”
is not the appropriate legal standard. When a litigant excludes
potential  jurors  based  solely  on  racial  grounds,  the  other
litigant’s equal protection rights have been violated. (See the
discussion  of  choice  C  above.)  A  litigant  has  the  right  to  an
“impartial” jury, and a jury of her peers. But there is no right
to a jury consisting of “a fair cross-section of the community.”

III.  MIDDLE-LEVEL REVIEW (GENDER,
ILLEGITIMACY AND ALIENAGE)

A.  Gender

1.  Male or female plaintiff

Question 46: A public high school has had a very high rate of

126

pregnancy among its students. In order to assist students who
keep their babies to complete high school, the high school has
established  an  infant  day-care  center  for  children  of  its
students,  and  also  offers  classes  in  child  care.  Because  the
child-care classes are always overcrowded, the school limits
admission  to  those  classes  solely  to  students  at  the  high
school  who  are  the  mothers  of  babies  in  the  infant  day-care
center.

A  male  student  at  the  high  school  has  legal  custody  of  his
infant son. The school provides care for his son in the infant
day-care center, but will not allow the male student to enroll
in  the  child-care  classes.  He  brings  suit  against  the  school
challenging, on constitutional grounds, his exclusion from the
child-care classes.

Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in
this case?

(A)    The  student  must  demonstrate  that  the  admission
requirement  is  not  rationally  related  to  a  legitimate
governmental interest.

(B)    The  student  must  demonstrate  that  the  admission
requirement  is  not  as  narrowly  drawn  as  possible  to
achieve a substantial governmental interest.

(C)  The school must demonstrate that the admission policy is
the  least  restrictive  means  by  which  to  achieve  a
compelling governmental interest.

(D)  The school must demonstrate that the admission policy is
important  governmental

to  an 

substantially  related 
interest.

Answer  46:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  issue  here  is  the
validity  of  the  school’s  gender-based  classification,  under
which students who are mothers of an infant can use the day-
care  center  but  students  who  are  fathers  of  an  infant  cannot.
For  such  a  gender-based  classification,  the  court  uses
intermediate-level  scrutiny,  under  which,  as  Choice  (D)
recites,  the  defendant  (the  government)  bears  the  burden  of
showing that its classification is “substantially related” to the
fulfillment  of  an  “important  governmental  interest.”  Craig  v.
Boren (1976). Notice that the standard is the same for a male

127

plaintiff  who  is  disadvantaged  by  the  classification  as  it
would be for a female plaintiff who was disadvantaged.

(A)  would  be  correct  if  the  classification  were  one  that  did
not  involve  a  suspect  or  semi-  suspect  class  or  fundamental
interest  (e.g.,  a  garden-variety  economic  or  social-welfare
regulation);  but  since  gender  is  a  semi-suspect  category,  the
standard in Choice (A) is insufficiently demanding.

(B)  is  incorrect  mainly  because,  when  the  classification  is
based on gender, the use of semi-strict scrutiny means that the
government  bears  the  burden  of  persuasion.  (Also,  the  key
phrases  “narrowly  drawn  as  possible”  and  “substantial
governmental interest” are not quite right.)

(C) is wrong because, while it correctly places the burden of
persuasion  on  the  government  defendant,  this  choice  recites
the standard for strict rather than semi-strict scrutiny.

IV.  FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

A.  Voting rights

1.  Fifteenth Amendment

Question 47:  Twenty  percent  of  the  residents  of  Green  City
are  members  of  minority  racial  groups.  These  residents  are
evenly distributed among the many different residential areas
of the city. The five city council members of Green City are
elected  from  five  single-member  electoral  districts  that  are
nearly equally populated. No candidate has ever been elected
to  the  city  council  who  was  a  member  of  a  minority  racial
group.

A  group  of  citizens  who  are  members  of  minority  racial
groups file suit in federal district court seeking a declaratory
judgment  that  the  single-member  districts  in  Green  City  are
unconstitutional. They claim that the single-member districting
system  in  that  city  diminishes  the  ability  of  voters  who  are
members  of  minority  racial  groups  to  affect  the  outcome  of
city  elections.  They  seek  an  order  from  the  court  forcing  the
city  to  adopt  an  at-large  election  system  in  which  the  five
candidates  with  the  greatest  vote  totals  would  be  elected  to
the city council. No state or federal statutes are applicable to

128

the resolution of this suit.

Which of the following constitutional provisions provides the
most obvious basis for plaintiffs’ claim in this suit?

(A)  The Thirteenth Amendment.
(B)  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(C)    The  Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth

Amendment.

(D)  The Fifteenth Amendment.
Answer  47:  The  correct  answer  is  Choice  (D).  Direct
impairments of the right to vote, based on a person’s race or
color,  may  violate  the  Fifteenth  Amendment,  even  where
Congress has not passed a statute banning the impairment.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  Thirteenth  Amendment  bars  only
slavery.  Congress  has  the  power  to  ban  the  “badges  and
incidents” of slavery under this Amendment, and voting rules
that have a racially discriminatory impact might qualify as a
badge-or-incident,  but  Congress  has  not  used  its  power  here
(since we’re told that there is no applicable federal statute).

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  Due  Process  Clause  does  not
directly  address  voting  rights,  so  any  due  process  violation
would  be  far  more  tenuous  than  the  Thirteenth  Amendment
claim. (There might be a valid Fourteenth Amendment equal
protection claim, but that’s not one of the choices.)

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  P&I
Clause  is  interpreted  to  protect  only  the  rights  of  “national”
(not state) citizenship, and the right to vote in a local election
is not a right of national citizenship, at least where the local
government  is  not  discriminating  against  those  who  recently
moved there.

B.  Ballot access

1.  Two invalid restrictions

a.  Unfair to new parties

Question  48:  A  state  has  a  statute  providing  that  an
unsuccessful  candidate  in  a  primary  election  for  a  party’s
nomination  for  elected  public  office  may  not  become  a
candidate for the same office at the following general election

129

by nominating petition or by write-in votes.

A  woman  sought  her  party’s  nomination  for  governor  in  the
May primary election. After losing in the primary, the woman
filed  nominating  petitions  containing  the  requisite  number  of
signatures to become a candidate for the office of governor in
the following general election. The chief elections officer of
the  state  refused  to  certify  the  woman’s  petitions  solely
because  of  the  above  statute.  The  woman  then  filed  suit  in
federal  district  court  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  this
state statute.

As  a  matter  of  constitutional  law,  which  of  the  following  is
the proper burden of persuasion in this suit?

(A)    The  woman  must  demonstrate  that  the  statute  is  not

necessary to achieve a compelling state interest.

(B)    The  woman  must  demonstrate  that  the  statute  is  not

rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

(C)    The  state  must  demonstrate  that  the  statute  is  the  least
restrictive  means  of  achieving  a  compelling  state
interest.

(D)    The  state  must  demonstrate  that  the  statute  is  rationally

related to a legitimate state interest.

Answer 48: Choice (C) is correct. Ballot restrictions that are
so  severe  that  minor-party  and  independent  candidates  have
no  realistic  opportunity  to  get  on  the  ballot  are  given  strict
scrutiny, under both the Equal Protection Clause and the First
Amendment’s  Freedom  of  Association  Clause.  Williams  v.
Rhodes (1968). The statute here is such a restriction, because
it makes it completely impossible (not just somewhat harder)
for someone who fails to get a major-party nomination to then
run as an independent or minor-party candidate in the general
election, no matter how much public support that person can
demonstrate.  Consequently,  the  choice  here,  by  articulating
strict scrutiny as the standard, is correct.
(A) is incorrect because, although it correctly articulates the
strict-scrutiny  standard,  it  incorrectly  says  that  the  plaintiff
who  is  challenging  the  government  bears  the  burden  of
persuasion;  in  those  scenarios  triggering  strict  scrutiny,  the
burden of persuasion is on the government.

130

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  incorrectly  uses  the  easy-to-satisfy
mere-rationality standard, when what is at issue is a serious
impairment of the fundamental right to be a candidate (and the
right of voters to choose the best candidate).

(D) is wrong because, for the reasons stated above, the court
would apply the strict scrutiny standard on these facts.

Question  49:  A  state  statute  permits  a  person’s  name  to
appear  on  the  general  election  ballot  as  a  candidate  for
statewide  public  office  if  the  person  pays  a  $100  filing  fee
and provides proof from the State Elections Board that he or
she  was  nominated  in  the  immediately  preceding  primary
election  by  one  of  the  state’s  two  major  political  parties.  It
also  permits  the  name  of  an  independent  candidate  or  a
candidate of a smaller party to appear on the general election
ballot if that person pays a filing fee of $1,000, and submits
petitions  signed  by  at  least  3  percent  of  the  voters  who
actually cast ballots for the office of governor in the last state
election. The state maintains that these filing requirements are
necessary to limit the size of the election ballot, to eliminate
frivolous  candidacies,  and  to  help  finance  the  high  cost  of
elections.

Historically, very few of the state’s voters who are members
of racial minority groups have been members of either of the
two  major  political  parties.  Recently,  a  new  political  party
has  been  formed  by  some  of  these  voters.  Which  of  the
following constitutional provisions would be most helpful to
the  new  political  party  as  a  basis  for  attacking  the
constitutionality of this statute?

(A)  The First Amendment.
(B)  The Thirteenth Amendment.
(C)  The Fourteenth Amendment.
(D)  The Fifteenth Amendment.
Answer  49:  Choice  (C)  is  correct,  because  access  to  the
ballot  is  protected  by  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the
Fourteenth  Amendment.  In  particular,  the  Court  has  strictly
scrutinized state burdens that seem to protect major parties at
the  expense  of  new  parties,  minor  parties  and  independent
candidates, especially where the disadvantaged voters and/or

131

candidates are racial minorities. See, e.g., Williams v. Rhodes
(1968).  While  the  equal  protection  argument  might  not  win
(the  restrictions  here  on  candidates  from  new  parties  are
much less severe than the ones struck down in Williams, and
might not even trigger strict scrutiny), it is the only argument
of  the  four  presented  that  has  even  a  reasonable  chance  of
success.

(A) is wrong because while speech is protected by the First
Amendment,  access  to  the  ballot  is  protected  by  the
Fourteenth Amendment. A political party’s argument that it is
being  denied  ballot  access  might  theoretically  be  based  on
freedom-of-association concepts. But the Court has tended to
decide such ballot-access cases on equal protection grounds,
not on First Amendment grounds. On the facts here, the state is
not  saying  that  people  may  not  get  together  to  join  the  new
political  party  that  is  the  plaintiff  here;  the  state  is  merely
making  it  tough  for  that  party  to  get  on  the  ballot.  Since  the
essence  of  the  party’s  claim  is  that  the  state  is  prefering  the
two  established  parties  over  newcomer  parties,  that’s  really
an “unequal treatment” claim, i.e., an equal protection claim.

(B) is wrong because, while the members of the new political
party are racial minorities, the issue in this question is access
to  the  ballot,  not  the  badges  and  incidents  of  slavery.  The
Thirteenth Amendment, § 1, provides that “neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for a crime . . .
shall exist in the United States.” Section 2 allows Congress to
pass “all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges
and incidents of slavery.” While the members of the new party
that  is  the  plaintiff  here  are  racial  minorities,  the  connection
between a state’s making it hard for a minority-based party to
get  on  the  ballot  and  the  institution  of  slavery  would  almost
certainly be held to be too attenuated to constitute a Thirteenth
Amendment violation.
(D) is wrong because the Fifteenth Amendment prohibits the
federal  and  state  governments  from  denying  any  citizen  the
right to vote for reasons of race or color, and the state statute
here  isn’t  inhibiting  anyone’s  right  to  vote;  it’s  directed  at
who may be on the ballot. Traditionally, the Court has viewed
ballot-access  restrictions  as  implicating  only  the  Equal

132

Protection Clause, not the Fifteenth Amendment right to vote.

C.  Necessities

1.  Education

Question 50: Public schools in a state are financed, in large
part,  by  revenue  derived  from  real  estate  taxes  imposed  by
each  school  district  on  the  taxable  real  property  located  in
that  district.  Public  schools  also  receive  other  revenue  from
private  gifts,  federal  grants,  student  fees,  and  local  sales
taxes.  For  many  years,  the  state  has  distributed  additional
funds,  which  come  from  the  state  treasury,  to  local  school
districts  in  order  to  equalize  the  funds  available  on  a  per-
student basis for each public school district. These additional
funds are distributed on the basis of a state statutory formula
that  considers  only  the  number  of  students  in  each  public
school  district  and  the  real  estate  tax  revenue  raised  by  that
district.  The  formula  does  not  consider  other  revenue
received by a school district from different sources.

The  school  boards  of  two  school  districts,  together  with
parents  and  schoolchildren  in  those  districts,  bring  suit  in
federal court to enjoin the state from allocating the additional
funds from the state treasury to individual districts pursuant to
this  formula.  They  allege  that  the  failure  of  the  state,  in
allocating this additional money, to take into account a school
district’s sources of revenue other than revenue derived from
taxes  levied  on  real  estate  located  there  violates  the  Equal
Protection  Clause  of 
the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  The
complaint does not allege that the allocation of the additional
state funds based on the current statutory formula has resulted
in  a  failure  to  provide  minimally  adequate  education  to  any
child.

(C)  Because no fundamental right or suspect classification is

  Because  the  funding  formula  inevitably  leads  to
disparities  among  the  school  districts  in  their  levels  of
total funding, the plaintiffs must only demonstrate that the
funding  formula  is  not  substantially  related  to  the
furtherance of an important state interest.

(D) 

v.  Rodriguez 

Answer 50:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  First,  education  is  not  a
fundamental right for equal protection purposes. San Antonio
(1973).  Second,  wealth
Sch.  Dist. 
classifications  are  not  a  suspect  category.  This  choice
therefore  correctly  asserts  that  (1)  no  fundamental  right  or
suspect classification is involved in this case; and (2) where
this is true, the plaintiff must bear the very difficult burden of
proving  that  there  is  no  rational  relationship  between  the
classification being used and any legitimate state interest. (By
the way, it is very unlikely that the plaintiffs would win under
this test; a school-funding scheme relying principally on local
property  taxes  was  upheld  against  rational-basis  equal
protection  attack  in  San  Antonio  Sch.  Dist.  v.  Rodriguez,
supra.)

(A) is wrong because classifications based on wealth are not
“inherently  suspect”  for  equal  protection  purposes,  so  such
classifications  do  not  have  to  satisfy  the  strict  scrutiny
standard that this choice articulates.
(B) is wrong because the Court has held that education (or at
least  the  right  to  have  a  public  education  that  goes  beyond
minimally-adequate  standards)  is  not  a  fundamental  right  for
equal  protection  purposes;  therefore,  the  strict  scrutiny
standard articulated by this choice would not apply.
(D)  is  wrong  because  it  articulates  an  intermediate  level  of
scrutiny, and that level is only used in cases involving semi-
suspect classifications (e.g., ones based on gender).

I.    THE “TAKING” CLAUSE

A.  The “Taking” Clause generally

1.  Taking vs. regulation

a.  Guidelines

Question 51: A company that operated a supermarket wanted
to  expand  the  size  of  the  building  it  owned  that  housed  the
supermarket,  by  adding  space  for  a  coffeehouse.  The
company’s building was located in the center of five acres of
land  owned  by  the  company  and  devoted  wholly  to  parking
for its supermarket customers.
City  officials  refused  to  grant  a  required  building  permit  for
the coffeehouse addition unless the company established in its
store  a  child  care  center  that  would  take  up  space  at  least
equal to the size of the proposed coffeehouse addition, which
was to be 20 percent of the existing building. This action of
the  city  officials  was  authorized  by  provisions  of  the
applicable  zoning  ordinance.  In  a  suit  filed  in  state  court
against  appropriate  officials  of  the  city,  the  company
challenged  the  child  care  center  requirement  solely  on
constitutional  grounds.  The 
the
requirement even though city officials presented no evidence
and  made  no  findings  to  justify  it  other  than  a  general
assertion that there was a shortage of child care facilities in
the city. The company appealed. The court hearing the appeal
should  hold  that  the  requirement  imposed  by  the  city  on  the
issuance of this building permit is
(A)  constitutional, because the burden was on the company to
demonstrate  that  there  was  no  rational  relationship
between this requirement and a legitimate governmental
interest,  and  the  company  could  not  do  so  because  the
requirement is reasonably related to improving the lives
of families and children residing in the city.

lower  court  upheld 

(B)  constitutional, because the burden was on the company to

135

demonstrate  that  this  requirement  was  not  necessary  to
vindicate  a  compelling  governmental  interest,  and  the
company could not do so on these facts.

(C)    unconstitutional,  because  the  burden  was  on  the  city  to
demonstrate  that  this  requirement  was  necessary  to
vindicate  a  compelling  governmental  interest,  and  the
city failed to meet its burden under that standard.

(D)    unconstitutional,  because  the  burden  was  on  the  city  to
this
demonstrate  a  rough  proportionality  between 
requirement  and  the  impact  of  the  company’s  proposed
action on the community, and the city failed to do so.
Answer  51:  Choice  (D)  is  correct,  because  without  the
showing  of  “rough  proportionality”  specified  in  this  choice,
the  ordinance  violates  the  Takings  Clause.  Dolan  v.  City  of
Tigard  (1994)  holds  that  when  a  city  conditions  a  building
permit  on  some  “give  back”  by  the  owner,  there  must  be  a
“rough  proportionality”  between  the  burdens  on  the  public
that the building permit would bring about, and the benefits to
the public from the give-back. There’s nothing in the facts to
suggest  that  the  city  ever  made  the  required  showing  here.
(Indeed,  the  facts  tell  us  that  city  officials  presented  no
evidence  of  any  sort,  so  they  certainly  didn’t  produce
evidence  either  about  the  size  of  the  public  burden  from
allowing  the  coffeehouse  or  the  size  of  the  corresponding
benefit  from  the  new  child  care  facility  they  were  requiring
here.)

(A),  (B),  and  (C)  are  all  wrong  because  they  misstate  the
burden  of  proof  and  the  standard.  When  a  city  demands  a
“give back” in return for approving construction, the city, not
the  owner,  bears 
to  rough
proportionality  (and  this  burden  is  probably  somewhere
between the easy-to-satisfy “rational relation” test of Choice
(A) and the strict scrutiny of Choice (D)).

a.  Significance

Question 52: A doctor, a resident of the city of Greenville in
the state of Green, is a physician licensed to practice in both
Green and the neighboring state of Red. The doctor finds that
the  most  convenient  place  to  treat  her  patients  who  need
hospital care is in the publicly owned and operated municipal
hospital  of  the  city  of  Redville  in  the  state  of  Red,  which  is
located  just  across  the  state  line  from  Greenville.  For  many
years  the  doctor  had  successfully  treated  her  patients  in  that
hospital.  Early  this  year  she  was  notified  that  she  could  no
longer treat patients in the Redville hospital because she was
not  a  resident  of  Red,  and  a  newly  adopted  rule  of  the
Redville  hospital,  which  was  adopted  in  conformance  with
all  required  procedures,  stated  that  every  physician  who
practices in that hospital must be a resident of Red.

Which  of  the  following  constitutional  provisions  would  be
most  helpful  to  the  doctor  in  an  action  to  challenge  her
exclusion  from  the  Redville  hospital  solely  on  the  basis  of
this hospital rule?

(A)  The Bill of Attainder Clause.
(B)  The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.
(C)  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(D)  The Ex Post Facto Clause.
Answer  52:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  When  a  state  (or
subdivision  of  a  state,  like  a  city  and  its  municipally-owned
operations)  regulates  a  right  that  is  “fundamental  to  national
unity,” and does so in a way that disadvantages out-of-staters,
that  regulation  will  essentially  be  subject  to  strict  scrutiny
under the Art. IV Privileges and Immunities Clause. (Among
other  things,  the  state  must  show  that  the  discrimination
against non-residents bears a “substantial relationship” to the
problem  the  state  is  attempting  to  solve.)  Practice  of  one’s
business  or  profession  is  a  right  “fundamental  to  national
unity” for P&I purposes.
The  case  here  is  on  all  fours  with  New  Hampshire  v.  Piper
(1985),  where  the  Court  held  that  New  Hampshire’s  attempt
to restrict the right to practice law to state residents violated
the  Art.  IV  P&I  Clause.  Applying  Piper,  since  there’s  no

137

showing  that  out-of-state  doctors  are  the  peculiar  source  of
any  special  problem  that  the  hospital  is  trying  to  solve,  the
restriction violates the P&I Clause.

(By  the  way,  there’s  no  exception  under  the  P&I  Clause  for
activities in which the city or state is a “market participant,”
as there is under the dormant commerce clause. United Bldg.
and Constr. Trades Counc. v. Camden (1984). So the fact that
the city owns the hospital that’s making the rule doesn’t help
it, as it would against a Commerce Clause attack.)

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  legislature  of  state  Red  was  not
trying to punish the doctor. A bill of attainder is a legislative
act that attempts to inflict punishment without a judicial trial
upon individuals who are designated by name or in terms of
past  conduct.  The  constitutional  prohibition  against  a  bill  of
attainder  would  not  be  helpful  to  the  doctor  because  the
hospital  here  merely  took  the  purely  regulatory  action  of
changing the residency requirement for practicing medicine at
the  hospital — no  public  entity  named  the  doctor  as  a
criminal,  or  attempted  to  punish  or  stigmatize  her,  which  is
what a bill of attainder would have done.
(C) is wrong because the doctor would have to show that the
licensing  requirement  was  not  rationally  related 
to  a
legitimate government interest, a showing the doctor probably
couldn’t  make.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth
Amendment provides that no state shall make or enforce any
law  which  shall  deprive  any  person  of  life,  liberty,  or
property,  without  due  process  of  law.  When  a  fundamental
right  is  not  involved,  substantive  due  process  requires  only
that  a  law  be  “rationally  related”  to  the  achievement  of  a
“legitimate  government  interest.”  So  to  win  on  due  process,
the  doctor  would  have  to  prove  that  Red’s  new  residency
requirement  was  not  rationally  related  to  some  legitimate
government  purpose.  This  standard  is  very  lenient  and  easy-
to-satisfy.  Here,  for  instance,  the  hospital  could  plausibly
claim that it wants to have on staff only doctors who live very
nearby,  and  that  it’s  entitled  to  use  state  of  residence  as  a
proxy  for  nearby-ness.  Although  the  fit  between  means  and
end  isn’t  very  tight  under  this  rationale,  it’s  almost  certainly
tight  enough  to  meet  the  extremely  lenient  rational-relation

138

standard.

the 

federal  government  and 

(D)  is  wrong  because  state  Red  was  not  legislating  against
past acts. The Ex Post Facto Clauses, Article I, § 9 and § 10,
prohibit  both 
the  state,
respectively, from passing legislation that retroactively alters
the  criminal  law  as  to  offenses  or  punishments,  in  a
substantially prejudicial manner. A retroactive change in civil
regulations, such as licensing requirements, cannot violate the
prohibition, since the prohibition applies only to “penal,” i.e.,
punitive,  measures.  Here,  the  facts  make  it  clear  that  the
hospital was not making a rule penalizing past acts, but was
instead making residency a requirement to practice medicine
in state Red going forward.

III.  BILLS OF ATTAINDER

that

to  penalties 

Question  53:  Two  tenured  professors  at  a  state  university
drafted  a  new  university  regulation  prohibiting  certain  kinds
of speech on campus. Students, staff, and faculty convicted by
campus  tribunals  of  violating  the  regulation  were  made
fines,  suspensions,
subject 
expulsions,  and  termination  of  employment.  The  regulation
was  widely  unpopular  and  there  was  a  great  deal  of  public
anger  directed  toward  the  professors  who  drafted  it.  The
following  year,  the  state  legislature  approved  a  severable
provision  in  the  appropriations  bill  for  the  university
declaring that none of the university’s funding could be used
to pay the two professors, who were specifically named in the
provision.  In  the  past,  the  professors’  salaries  had  always
been  paid  from  funds  appropriated  to  the  university  by  the
legislature, and the university had no other funds that could be
used to pay them.
If  the  professors  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  the
appropriations  provision,  is  the  court  likely  to  uphold  the
provision?
(A)  No, because it amounts to the imposition of a punishment

by the legislature without trial.

(B)    No,  because  it  was  based  on  conduct  the  professors

engaged in before it was enacted.

139

(C)    Yes,  because  the  Eleventh  Amendment  gives  the  state
legislature  plenary  power  to  appropriate  state  funds  in
the  manner  that  it  deems  most  conducive  to  the  welfare
of its people.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause  requires
the court to enforce the provision strictly according to its
terms.

Answer 53: Choice (A) is correct. The provision is a bill of
attainder.  A  bill  of  attainder  is  a  law  that  provides  for  the
punishment  of  a  particular  person  without 
trial.  The
challenged  provision  satisfies  this  definition  because  it
deprives  two  named  professors  of  their  salaries,  and  thus,
their employment — a court would almost certainly hold that
the  purpose  of  the  provision  was  punitive  rather  than  purely
regulatory.  (Notice  that  this  correct  choice  never  uses  the
phrase  “bill  of  attainder,”  even  though  that’s  the  key  to  the
analysis.  This  is  typical  of  the  MBE:  When  a  particular
doctrine  with  an  unusual  name  is  the  key  to  solving  the
problem,  the  examiners  will  often  go  out  of  their  way  to
phrase  the  correct  choice  in  terms  of  how  the  doctrine
functions,  rather  than  giving  the  doctrine’s  name — they  fear
that giving the doctrine’s name will spot the issue for you, and
make the problem too easy. So it’s up to you to notice that this
is a bill of attainder, and that as such, the law has the problem
specified in Choice (A)).

that 

(B) is wrong because, while it is true that the court is likely to
strike down the provision, this answer misstates the basis for
this  conclusion.  The  fact 
the  professors’  conduct
preexisted the state law would be significant if the state law
provided  for  a  criminal  penalty — it  would 
then  be
unconstitutional as an ex post facto law in violation of Article
I, Section 10, Clause 1 of the Constitution. The ex post facto
clause,  however,  does  not  apply  to  laws  attaching  civil
consequences to past conduct, which is what the present law
does.
(C)  is  wrong  because  the  Eleventh  Amendment  provides  for
state sovereign immunity from certain kinds of adjudications.
It  does  not  extend  legislative  authority  of  any  kind  to  the
states.

140

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause
(Article  IV,  Section  1  of  the  Constitution)  does  not  insulate
state  laws  from  constitutional  challenge.  It  merely  requires
state courts to accord due authority to the laws of other states,
something that is not at issue here.

Question 54: Insurance is provided in a particular state only
insurance
by  private  companies.  Although 
commissioner inspects insurance companies for solvency, the
state  does  not  regulate  their  rates  or  policies.  A  particular
insurance  company  charges  higher  rates  for  burglary
insurance to residents of one part of a county in the state than
to residents of another section of the same county because of
the different crime rates in those areas.
A  resident  of  that  county  was  charged  the  higher  rate  by  the
insurance  company  because  of  the  location  of  her  residence.
The  resident  sues  the  insurance  company,  alleging  that  the
differential in insurance rates unconstitutionally denies her the
equal protection of the laws.

Will the resident’s suit succeed?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  higher  crime  rate  in  the  resident’s
neighborhood demonstrates that the county police are not
giving persons who reside there the equal protection of
the laws.

(B)  Yes, because the insurance rate differential is inherently

discriminatory.

(C)    No,  because  the  constitutional  guarantee  of  equal
protection of the laws is not applicable to the actions of
these insurance companies.

(D)  No, because there is a rational basis for the differential in

insurance rates.

142

Answer  54:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Although  the  state  does
some  regulation  of  the  insurance  industry  (for  solvency),  the
state  is  not  sufficiently  involved  with  the  operations  of  the
the  requirement — 
insurance  company  here 
applicable  to  any  equal  protection  claim — that  there  be
“state  action.”  Notice  that  the  choice  never  uses  the  phrase
“state  action” — it’s  up  to  you  to  spot  the  state  action  issue
and  to  notice  that  this  choice’s  use  of  the  phrase  “not
applicable to the actions of these . . . companies” captures the
state-action concept.

to  satisfy 

(A) is wrong for several reasons, including most basically the
fact that it ignores the state-action requirement for any equal
protection claim. (The fact that the state police are arguably
failing to give equal protection is irrelevant, since the police
aren’t a party and aren’t tightly associated with a party.)

(B) and (D) are wrong, similarly, because they too ignore the
state-action  requirement  for  equal  protection  claims.  (If  the
state-action requirement were satisfied — if, for instance, the
state  expressly  required  burglary-insurance  rates  to  be
adjusted based on local crime rates — then (D) would be the
best  answer  because  it  correctly  expresses  the  idea  that  a
governmental  classification  that  does  not  involve  a  suspect
class  or  fundamental  right  needs  to  be  supported  only  by  a
rational basis.)

II.   CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF

CIVIL RIGHTS

A.  Congress’s power to reach private conduct

1.  Thirteenth Amendment

a.  “Badges of slavery”

Question 55:  A  proposed  federal  statute  would  prohibit  all
types of discrimination against black persons on the basis of
their race in every business transaction executed anywhere in
the  United  States  by  any  person  or  entity,  governmental  or
private.
Is this proposed federal statute likely to be constitutional?

143

(A)    Yes,  because  it  could  reasonably  be  viewed  as  an
exercise  of  Congress’s  authority  to  enact  laws  for  the
general welfare.

(B)  Yes, because it could reasonably be viewed as a means of

enforcing the provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment.

(C)    No,  because  it  would  regulate  purely  local  transactions

that are not in interstate commerce.

(D)  No, because it would invade the powers reserved to the

states by the Tenth Amendment.

(B) 

Answer  55:  Choice 
is  correct.  The  Thirteenth
Amendment  permits  Congress  to  forbid  the  “badges  and
incidents” of slavery. This power has been interpreted by the
Court  to  include  the  power  to  forbid  even  private  acts  of
racial discrimination against black people, on the theory that
such discrimination is the relic of slavery.

(A) is wrong because Congress does not have any “authority
to enact laws for the general welfare” (only the power to “tax
and spend” for the general welfare).

(C) is wrong because this might be an explanation of why the
statute couldn’t be supported by Congress’s commerce power,
but  the  Thirteenth  Amendment  power  allows  Congress  to
forbid  even  purely 
(i.e.,
discrimination that does not involve interstate commerce).

racial  discrimination 

local 

(D)  is  wrong  because  if  Congress’s  action  falls  within  a
specific  grant  of  power  (here,  the  Thirteenth  Amendment
grant),  the  Tenth  Amendment  acts  as  a  limitation  only  in  the
highly  specialized  case  of  Congress’s  attempt  to  take  over
state lawmaking mechanisms.

CHAPTER 9
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

I.    GENERAL THEMES

A.  Analysis of content-based government action

1.  Protected category

a.  “Viewpoint neutrality” not enough

Question  56:  The  Federal  Family  Film  Enhancement  Act
assesses  an  excise  tax  of  10%  on  the  price  of  admission  to
public  movie  theaters  when  they  show  films  that  contain
actual or simulated scenes of human sexual intercourse.

Which  of  the  following  is  the  strongest  argument  against  the
constitutionality of this federal act?

(A)    The  act  imposes  a  prior  restraint  on  the  freedom  of

speech protected by the First Amendment.

(B)  The act is not rationally related to any legitimate national

interest.

(C)  The act violates the equal protection concepts embodied
in  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment
because  it  imposes  a  tax  on  the  price  of  admission  to
view certain films and not on the price of admission to
view comparable live performances.

(D)  The act imposes a tax solely on the basis of the content of
speech without adequate justification and, therefore, it is
prohibited by the Freedom of Speech Clause of the First
Amendment.

Answer  56:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  tax  applies  only  to
films that show some form of sexual intercourse. This means
that the regulation is content-based (it treats different forms of
expression differently depending solely on the message being
conveyed). Therefore, the court will apply strict scrutiny to it.
(Notice,  by  the  way,  that  the  tax  is  not  limited  to  films  that
would  be  “obscene” — not  all  portrayals  of  sexual
intercourse  would  be  obscene;  if  only  obscene  films  were
taxed, probably strict scrutiny would not be used.)

145

Choice (A) is wrong because a tax is not a “prior restraint”; a
legislative  act 
imposes  a  prior  restraint  only  where
government  forbids  the  doing  of  the  act  in  advance  (e.g.,  a
statute  forbidding  showing  of  a  film  without  first  paying  a
license fee). Since the tax here kicks in only after the showing
of the film, it is not a prior restraint.

Choice (B) is wrong because the regulation here is a content-
based  regulation  on  expression,  and  such  a  restraint  is
evaluated  based  on  strict  scrutiny,  not  the  easy-to-satisfy
rational- relation test.

Choice (C) is wrong because an equal protection attack on a
legislative  classification  that  does  not  involve  a  suspect  or
semi-suspect class or fundamental right is evaluated based on
the easy-to-satisfy rational-relation standard, and the tax here
would likely pass that standard.

II.   DEFAMATION AND INVASION OF PRIVACY

A.  Other state-law tort claims

Question  57:  Roberts,  a  professional  motorcycle  rider,  put
on a performance in a privately owned stadium during which
he  leaped  his  motorcycle  over  21  automobiles.  Spectators
were charged $55 each to view the jump and were prohibited
from  using  cameras.  However,  the  local  television  station
filmed  the  whole  event  from  within  the  stadium  without  the
knowledge  or  consent  of  Roberts  and  showed  the  film  in  its
entirety  on  the  evening  newscast  that  day.  Roberts  thereafter
brought  suit  to  recover  damages  from  the  station  for  the
admittedly  unauthorized  filming  and  broadcasting  of  the  act.
The television station raised only constitutional defenses.
The court should
(A)    hold  against  Roberts,  because  the  First  and  Fourteenth
Amendments  authorize  press  coverage  of  newsworthy
entertainment events.

(B)    hold  against  Roberts,  because  under  the  First  and
Fourteenth Amendments news broadcasts are absolutely
privileged.

(C)    find  the  station  liable,  because  its  action  deprives

146

Roberts of his property without due process.

(D)    find  the  station  liable,  because  the  First  and  Fourteenth
Amendments  do  not  deprive  an  entertainer  of  the
commercial value of his or her performances.
is  correct.  While 

Answer  57:  Choice  (D) 
the  First
Amendment does indeed give the media a privilege to cover
newsworthy  events,  that  privilege  does  not  extend  to  the
broadcasting of a performance where this would deprive the
performer  of  the  commercial  value  of  that  performance.  The
fact  pattern  here  is  on  all  fours  with  Zacchini  v.  Scripps-
Howard Broadcasting (1997).

(A) is wrong, because while the First Amendment does give a
privilege  for  press  coverage  of  newsworthy  events,  that
privilege does not extend to a broadcast that takes so much of
an  act  that  it  deprives  the  performer  of  much  of  the
commercial value of the act.

(B)  is  wrong  because  news  broadcasts  are  not  “absolutely
privileged”; rather, they receive a qualified privilege, subject
to  a  number  of  limits  (including,  here,  the  limit  that  the
broadcast not appropriate so much of a performance that the
commercial  value  of  the  performance  is  taken  from  the
performer).

(C)  is  wrong,  because  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  only  against  a  taking  by  a
government,  and  any  taking  here  was  by  a  private  party  (the
TV station), not by the government.

III.  OBSCENITY

A.  Regulating secondary effects of adult speech

1.  Regulation of red-light districts

Question  58:  A  city  has  an  ordinance  that  prohibits  the
location  of  “adult  theaters  and  bookstores”  (theaters  and
bookstores  presenting  sexually  explicit  performances  or
materials) in residential or commercial zones within the city.
The  ordinance  was  intended  to  protect  surrounding  property
from 
likely  adverse  secondary  effects  of  such
establishments.  “Adult  theaters  and  bookstores”  are  freely

the 

147

permitted in the areas of the city zoned industrial, where those
adverse secondary effects are not as likely. A storekeeper is
denied a zoning permit to open an adult theater and bookstore
in a building owned by him in an area zoned commercial. As
a  result,  the  storekeeper  brings  suit  in  an  appropriate  court
challenging the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance.

Which  of 
constitutionality of this city ordinance is most accurate?

statements 

following 

regarding 

the 

the

(A)  The ordinance is valid, because a city may enforce zoning
restrictions  on  speech-related  businesses  to  ensure  that
the  messages  they  disseminate  are  acceptable  to  the
residents of adjacent property.

(B)    The  ordinance  is  valid,  because  a  city  may  enforce  this
type  of  time,  place,  and  manner  regulation  on  speech-
related  businesses,  so  long  as  this  type  of  regulation  is
designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and
does  not  unreasonably  limit  alternative  avenues  of
communication.

(C)  The ordinance is invalid, because a city may not enforce
zoning  regulations  that  deprive  potential  operators  of
adult theaters and bookstores of their freedom to choose
the location of their businesses.

(D)    The  ordinance  is  invalid,  because  a  city  may  not  zone
property in a manner calculated to protect property from
the likely adverse secondary effects of adult theaters and
bookstores.

Answer  58:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  Supreme  Court  has
repeatedly held that even if a city is using its zoning powers
to limit or prohibit a speech-related activity, the regulation is
acceptable  if  the  city  is  reasonably  targeting  the  secondary
effects  of  that  speech  (e.g.,  crime  or  lower  property  values)
rather  than  targeting  the  expressive  content  of  that  speech.
See, e.g., Erie v. Pap’s A.M. (2004) (city may completely ban
“nude dancing” to combat the bad secondary effects of such).
Since the government is targeting the secondary effects rather
than  the  message,  the  regulation  is  to  be  evaluated  based  on
the test for content-neutral time, place and manner regulations,
which as this choice suggests makes such regulations valid as
long as they are designed to serve a substantial governmental

148

interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of
expression.  Since 
is
interest 
“substantial,” and since adult uses are permitted in alternative
venues  (areas  zoned  commercial),  these  requirements  are
easily satisfied.

in  preventing  blight 

the 

(A) is wrong because it falsely asserts that the city may use its
zoning  powers  to  forbid  particular  messages  based  on  their
content.  Such  a  content-based  regulation  would  have  to  be
strictly  scrutinized,  and  would  almost  certainly  be  struck
down.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  badly  misstates  the  law:  Cities  may
indeed  use  their  zoning  regulations  to  prevent  operators  of
adult  theaters  and  the  like  from  choosing  their  location,  as
long as the city is acting reasonably to combat the perceived
negative secondary effects of the business, rather than out of
distaste  for  the  content  of  the  messages  transmitted  by  the
business.

(D) is wrong because it exactly misstates present law; cities
may (not “may not”) “zone property in a manner calculated to
protect property from the likely adverse secondary effects of
adult theaters and bookstores.” Erie v. Pap’s, supra.

Question  59:  A  city  zoning  ordinance  contains  provisions
restricting  places  of  “adult  entertainment”  to  two  specified
city  blocks  within  the  commercial  center  of  the  city.  These
provisions  of  the  ordinance  define  “adult  entertainment”  as
“live or filmed nudity or sexual activity, real or simulated, of
an indecent nature.”

A  promoter  proposes  to  operate  an  adult  entertainment
establishment  outside  the  two-block  area  zoned  for  such
establishments  but  within  the  commercial  center  of  the  city.
When  his  application  for  permission  to  do  so  is  rejected
solely because it is inconsistent with provisions of the zoning
ordinance,  he  sues  the  appropriate  city  officials,  seeking  to
enjoin them from enforcing the adult entertainment provisions
of the ordinance against him. He asserts that these provisions
of  the  ordinance  violate  the  First  Amendment  as  made
applicable  to  the  city  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  In  this
case,  the  court  hearing  the  promoter’s  request  for  an

149

injunction  would  probably  hold  that  the  adult  entertainment
provisions of the city zoning ordinance are

(A)    constitutional,  because  they  do  not  prohibit  adult
entertainment  everywhere  in  the  city,  and  the  city  has  a
substantial  interest  in  keeping  the  major  part  of  its
commercial  center  free  of  uses  it  considers  harmful  to
that area.

(B)    constitutional,  because  adult  entertainment  of  the  kind
described in these provisions of the city ordinance is not
protected  by  the  free  speech  guarantee  of  the  First  and
Fourteenth Amendments.

(C)  unconstitutional, because they prohibit in the commercial
area of the city adult entertainment that is not “obscene”
within 
the  First  and  Fourteenth
Amendments.

the  meaning  of 

(D)    unconstitutional,  because  zoning  ordinances  that  restrict
freedom of speech may be justified only by a substantial
interest  in  preserving  the  quality  of  a  community’s
residential neighborhoods.

is  a  content-neutral  one 

Answer  59:  Choice  (A)  is  correct,  because  the  ordinance
here 
that  allows  reasonable
alternatives for the type of expression at issue. The Court has
held that a city may confine sexually explicit land uses (like
“adult theaters”) to a single part of town, as part of a content-
neutral  attempt  to  regulate  the  bad  “secondary  effects”  (e.g.,
increased  crime,  declining  property  values)  of  such  uses.
Renton  v.  Playtime  Theatres  (1986).  The  ordinance  here  is
exactly on point with Renton. (By the way, a 2000 case, Erie
v.  Pap’s  A.M.,  seems  to  go  even  further,  apparently  holding
that a city may combat the secondary effects of adult activity
like nude dancing by completely banning the activity, not just
limiting  it  to  a  defined  zone.)  The  key  to  the  analysis  is  that
the  city  is  (supposedly)  not  engaging  in  “content  based”
discrimination, because it’s attacking not the “message” of the
adult activity, but merely its “secondary effects” (bad effects
not  associated  with  the  precise  message,  like  extra  crime).
Therefore, this is to be analyzed as a time-place-and-manner
restriction (valid if it is substantially related to an important
leaves  open  reasonable
government  objective,  and 

it 

150

alternatives for the same type of expression) rather than as a
content-based restriction (subject to strict scrutiny and almost
certainly struck down).

(B) is wrong because adult entertainment is protected by the
First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments.  Certain 
types  of
expression, while not directly suppressible on the grounds of
their  content,  have  been  treated  by  the  Court  as  being
inherently  less  valuable,  so  that  they  may  be  regulated  more
extensively  than  speech  close  to  the  “core”  of  the  First
Amendment  values,  such  as  political  speech.  This  less-
favored category of speech includes speech that is “indecent,”
such as the adult entertainment here. So the zoning ordinance
here is constitutional, but not for the reason stated. While not
afforded the full protection of speech at the core of the First
Amendment,  such  as  political  speech,  public  adult  sexual
expression is protected to some extent.

(C)  is  wrong  because  non-obscene  adult  entertainment  may
its  First  Amendment
nonetheless  be  regulated  despite 
protection.  It’s  true  that,  as  choice  C  suggests,  some  adult
entertainment  as  defined  in  the  zoning  ordinance  is  non-
obscene,  and  may  therefore  not  be  banned  on  obscenity
grounds. But as described in choice A above, because of the
“secondary effects” associated with adult entertainment (e.g.,
extra crime and declining property values), the city may make
a 
adult
entertainment, by limiting it to a particular area of the city (or
even banning it completely from the city limits).

time-place-and-manner 

regulation 

such 

of 

(D)  is  wrong  because  there  are  allowable  reasons  for
speech  beyond  protecting  “a  community’s
regulating 
residential  neighborhoods.”  As  choice  A  above  describes,  a
city  may  confine  sexually  explicit  land  uses  like  “adult
theaters” to a single part of town, as part of a content-neutral
attempt to regulate the bad “secondary effects” of such uses.
The secondary effects that may be combatted are not limited
to  (though  they  may  include)  declining  quality  of  the
community’s  residential  neighborhoods.  (For  instance,  a  city
might ban adult entertainment from  the  core  business  district
because  such  entertainment  increases  street  crime,  reduces
commercial  property  values,  etc.)  So  choice  D  is  wrong

151

because it dramatically understates the bad secondary effects
that  a  city  is  permitted  to  combat  by  zoning  of  otherwise-
protected expression.

IV.  FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION, AND DENIAL

OF PUBLIC BENEFITS OR JOBS

A.  Denial of public benefit or job

1.  Non-illegal activities

a.  Licenses

Question 60:  A  city  ordinance  requires  every  operator  of  a
taxicab in the city to have a license and permits revocation of
that  license  only  for  “good  cause.”  The  taxicab  operator’s
licensing ordinance conditions the issuance of such a license
on an agreement by the licensee that the licensee “not display
in or on his or her vehicle any bumper sticker or other placard
or  sign  favoring  a  particular  candidate  for  any  elected
municipal  office.”  The  ordinance  also  states  that  it  imposes
this  condition  in  order  to  prevent  the  possible  imputation  to
the city council the views of its taxicab licensees and that any
licensee  who  violates  this  condition  shall  have  his  or  her
license revoked.
A  driver,  who  is  a  holder  of  a  taxicab  operator’s  license,
decorates  his  cab  with  bumper  stickers  and  other  signs
favoring  specified  candidates  in  a  forthcoming  election  for
municipal  offices.  A  proceeding  is  initiated  against  him  to
revoke his taxicab operator’s license on the sole basis of that
admitted  conduct.  In  this  proceeding,  does  the  driver  have  a
meritorious defense based on the U.S. Constitution?
(A)  No, because he accepted the license with knowledge of
the condition and, therefore, has no standing to contest it.
(B)    No,  because  a  taxicab  operator’s  license  is  a  privilege
and not a right and, therefore, is not protected by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(C)  Yes, because such a proceeding threatens the driver with
just

taking  of  property,  his 

license,  without 

a 
compensation.

152

(D)  Yes, because the condition imposed on taxicab operators’
licenses  restricts  political  speech  based  wholly  on  its
content, without any adequate governmental justification.
Answer  60:  Choice  (D)  is  the  best  response,  because  the
operator’s  ordinance  is  a  content-based  restriction  on  core
political  speech,  and  cannot  survive  strict  scrutiny.  The  city
would  not  be  permitted  to  simply  ban  all  citizens  from
displaying political bumper sticks on their cars (that would be
a  content-based  restriction  on  core  political  speech,  which
would  be  strictly  scrutinized,  and  struck  down  because  no
compelling governmental interest has been shown). What the
government  cannot  do  directly,  it  cannot  do  indirectly  by
conditioning  a  government  benefit  (a  cab  license)  on  the
licensee’s  agreement  not  to  exercise  the  speech  right  in
question.  And  nothing  about  the  taxicab-licensing  process
changes  the  fact  that  the  restriction  cannot  survive  strict
scrutiny:  There  is  no  indication  of  any  meaningful  risk  that
members of the public might incorrectly think that the slogans
were attributable to council members, and even if there were
such  risk,  avoiding  it  would  hardly  rise  to  the  level  of  a
“compelling” interest.
(A) is wrong because the ordinance is unconstitutional and the
driver  has  not  waived  his  rights  to  challenge  it.  It  is
presumptively  unconstitutional  for  the  government  to  place
burdens  on  speech  because  of  its  content.  To  justify  such
content-based regulation of speech, the government must show
that the regulation is necessary to achieve a compelling state
interest and is narrowly defined to achieve that end. The fact
that the city has not made display of all political messages a
crime, and has instead used its power to deny a hack license
as  a  “club”  to  induce  some  people  (cab  drivers)  to
“voluntarily” surrender their right to transmit those messages,
is  no  defense.  And  the  fact  that  the  driver  knew  of  the
condition  when  he  applied  for  his  license  would  not  cause
him to lose standing to contest this clear unconstitutionality.
(B) is wrong because calling a government-bestowed benefit
a “privilege” does not entitle the government to condition that
benefit  on  the  beneficiary’s  renunciation  of  the  right  to
constitutionally-protected  speech.  As  a  general  matter

153

(subject  to  some  exceptions  not  relevant  here),  government
may  not  condition  the  receipt  of  a  government-conferred
benefit  upon  the  beneficiary’s  willingness  to  forego  the
exercise  of  some  constitutional  right.  So,  for  instance,
government  can’t  say,  “We  hereby  fire  any  public  employee
who  is  a  member  of  the  Communist  Party,”  if  government
wouldn’t  have  the  power  under  the  First  Amendment  to  ban
Communist  Party  membership.  Elfbrandt  v.  Russell  (1966).
Here,  since  the  display  of  political  messages  on  bumper
stickers is protected by the First Amendment, the city cannot
condition a government-bestowed “privilege” (a cab license)
on the driver’s willingness to forego the right to make such a
display.

(C) is wrong because the ordinance is merely a regulation, not
a  “taking.”  The  Fifth  Amendment  provides  that  private
property shall not be taken for public use without paying just
compensation  to  the  owner.  If  the  city  confiscated  cab
licenses so that, say, it could operate all cabs itself for profit 
— and  then  refused  to  pay  the  former  license-holders
anything — the licensees might have a “taking” argument. But
here,  what  is  occurring  is  merely  regulation,  and  it’s
regulation of a sort that falls far short of denying the licensee
all economically viable use of his property (the standard for
when a “taking” is deemed to have occurred). Therefore, the
Takings Clause has not been violated.

2.  Speech critical of superiors or otherwise inappropriate

a.  Non-policy-making role

Question 61:  A  clerical  worker  has  been  employed  for  the
past two years in a permanent position in the Public Records
Office of a county. The clerk has been responsible for copying
and filing records of real estate transactions in that office. The
clerk  works  in  a  nonpublic  part  of  the  office  and  has  no
contact  with  members  of  the  public.  However,  state  law
provides  that  all  real  estate  records  in  that  office  are  to  be
made available for public inspection.

On the day an attempted assassination of the governor of the
state  was  reported  on  the  radio,  the  clerk  remarked  to  a
coworker, “Our governor is such an evil man, I am sorry they

154

did  not  get  him.”  The  clerk’s  coworker  reported  this  remark
to  the  clerk’s  employer,  the  county  recorder.  After  the  clerk
admitted  making  the  remark,  the  county  recorder  dismissed
him  stating  that  “there  is  no  room  in  this  office  for  a  person
who hates the governor so much.”

The clerk sued for reinstatement and back pay. His only claim
is that the dismissal violated his constitutional rights.

In  this  case,  the  court  should  hold  that  the  county  recorder’s
dismissal of the clerk was

(A)    unconstitutional,  because  it  constitutes  a  taking  without
just  compensation  of  the  clerk’s  property  interest  in  his
permanent position with the county.

(B)  unconstitutional, because in light of the clerk’s particular
employment  duties  his  right  to  express  himself  on  a
matter  of  public  concern  outweighed  any  legitimate
interest the state might have had in discharging him.
(C)  constitutional, because the compelling interest of the state
in having loyal and supportive employees outweighs the
interest of any state employee in his or her job or in free
speech on a matter of public concern.

(D)  nonjusticiable, because public employment is a privilege
rather  than  a  right  and,  therefore,  the  clerk  lacked
standing to bring this suit.

Answer  61:  The  correct  choice  is  (B).  The  facts  here  are
very  similar  to  those  of  Rankin  v.  McPherson,  where  the
Court  held  that:  (1)  the  clerk’s  statement  supporting  a  recent
assassination attempt (of President Reagan) was indeed on a
matter of “public concern”; and (2) the fact that the clerk had
no  policy-making  role  and  that  his  statement  had  little
negative impact on his job effectiveness made it unreasonable
to dismiss him for that statement.
Choice  (A)  is  wrong  because  even  a  “permanent”  public
employee (i.e., one with a property right in his post) may have
long  as
his 
procedures  constituting  due  process  are  followed.  In  other
words, what the Due Process Clause guarantees on these facts
is  that  the  clerk’s  job  won’t  be  taken  arbitrarily  or
capriciously,  not  that  the  job  won’t  be  taken  “without  just

just  compensation,  as 

taken  without 

job 

155

compensation”  (a  standard  that  would  more  properly  be
applied  to  the  taking  of  tangible  real  or  personal  property
rather than a job).

Choice (C) is wrong because the Court has held (in Rankin,
supra) that although the government has an interest in having
loyal  and  supportive  employees,  this  interest  does  not
outweigh the employee’s interest in commenting on matters of
public  concern,  where  the  comment  does  not  undermine  the
employee’s  effectiveness  in  light  of  the  non-policy-making
and limited scope of the employee’s job (which, like the job
here, was clerical).

Choice (D) is wrong because: (1) the Court does not use the
right/privilege  distinction 
in  First  Amendment  public
employment cases; and (2) even if the Court did believe that
public employment was a “privilege” rather than a “right,” the
Court would almost certainly view the case as justiciable.

b.  Interferes with job

Question  62:  A  city  ordinance  makes  the  city  building
inspector  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  buildings  in  that
city are kept up to building code standards, and requires the
inspector  to  refer  for  prosecution  all  known  building  code
violations.  Another  ordinance  provides  that  the  city  building
inspector may be discharged for “good cause.” The building
inspector  took  a  newspaper  reporter  through  a  number  of
rundown  buildings  in  a  slum  neighborhood.  After  using
various  epithets  and  slurs  to  describe  the  occupants  of  these
buildings, the building inspector stated to the reporter: “I do
not even try to get these buildings up to code or to have their
owners  prosecuted  for  code  violations  because  if  these
buildings are repaired, the people who live in them will just
wreck them again.” The reporter published these statements in
a  story  in  the  local  newspaper.  The  building  inspector
admitted he made the statements.
On  the  basis  of  these  statements,  the  city  council  discharged
the building inspector.
Is the action of the city council constitutional?
(A)  Yes, because the statements demonstrate that the building
inspector  has  an  attitude  toward  a  certain  class  of

156

persons  that  interferes  with  the  proper  performance  of
the obligations of his job.

(B)    Yes,  because  the  building  inspector  is  a  government
employee and a person holding such a position may not
make  public  comments 
inconsistent  with  current
governmental policy.

(C)    No,  because  the  statements  were  lawful  comments  on  a

matter of public concern.

(D)    No,  because  the  statements  were  published  in  a
newspaper  that  is  protected  by  the  First  and  Fourteenth
Amendments.

Answer 62: Choice (A) is correct. When a public employee
speaks on a matter that is arguably one of public concern, the
limited  protection  against  dismissal  or
employee  gets 
discipline.  However,  where  the  content  of  the  speech
interferes  with  the  speaker’s  proper  performance  of  his  job
(or  indicates  that  the  speaker  has  underlying  attitudes  that
would interfere with job performance), the balance is tipped
heavily toward the employer’s right to discharge or discipline
the  employee.  Here,  given  that  the  inspector  is  required  to
enforce  the  building  codes,  and  given  that  he  has  publicly
stated that he does not even try to do this core job function on
account  of  his  attitudes  towards  slum  dwellers,  the  city
council was clearly justified in firing him.

Choice  (B)  is  wrong  because  it  is  overbroad;  even  a
comments
employee  may  make  public 
government 
inconsistent  with  current  governmental  policy,  if  the  speaker
is  not  in  a  public  role  and/or  the  comments  do  not  interfere
with the speaker’s ability to perform his job adequately.
Choice  (C)  is  wrong  because,  although  the  comments  may
have been “lawful” and on a “matter of public concern,” these
two  facts  do  not  give  the  speaker  immunity  from  being
punished for the comments, for the reasons given above in the
discussion of the correct choice.
Choice (D) is wrong because the fact that the comments were
published  in  a  newspaper  that  was  in  turn  protected  by  the
First and Fourteenth Amendments, is irrelevant to the question
of whether the speaker may be punished; as described above,

157

government may discharge a government employee for making
statements  (even  ones  published  in  a  First-Amendment-
protected  newspaper) 
the
employee’s proper performance of his job.

interfere  with 

that  seriously 

V.   SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF THE MEDIA

A.  The media (and its special problems)

1.  Right of access

a.  No right to compel disclosure of government information

Question  63:  A  state  enacted  a  statute  providing  for  the
closure of the official state records of arrest and prosecution
of all persons acquitted of a crime by a court or against whom
criminal  charges  were  filed  and  subsequently  dropped  or
dismissed.  The  purpose  of  this  statute  is  to  protect  these
persons  from  further  publicity  or  embarrassment  relating  to
those  state  proceedings.  However,  this  statute  does  not
prohibit  the  publication  of  such  information  that  is  in  the
possession of private persons.
A  prominent  businessman  in  the  state  was  arrested  and
charged  with  rape.  Prior  to  trial,  the  prosecutor  announced
that  new  information  indicated  that  the  charges  should  be
dropped.  He  then  dropped  the  charges  without  further
explanation,  and  the  records  relating  thereto  were  closed  to
the  public  pursuant  to  the  statute.  A  newspaper  in  the  state
conducted an investigation to determine why the businessman
was  not  prosecuted,  but  was  refused  access  to  the  closed
official  state  records.  In  an  effort  to  determine  whether  the
law enforcement agencies involved were properly doing their
duty,  the  newspaper  filed  suit  against  appropriate  state
officials to force opening of the records and to invalidate the
statute  on  constitutional  grounds.  Which  of  the  following
would  be  most  helpful  to  the  state  in  defending  the
constitutionality of this statute?
(A)  The fact that the statute treats in an identical manner the
arrest and prosecution records of all persons who have
been  acquitted  of  a  crime  by  a  court  or  against  whom
criminal charges were filed and subsequently dropped or
dismissed.

158

(B)    The  argument  that  the  rights  of  the  press  are  no  greater

than those of citizens generally.

(C)    The  fact  that  the  statute  only  prohibits  public  access  to
these  official  state  records  and  does  not  prohibit  the
publication  of  information  they  contain  that  is  in  the
possession of private persons.

(D)    The  argument  that  the  state  may  seal  official  records

owned by the state on any basis its legislature chooses.

Answer  63:  Choice  (C)  is  correct,  because  there  is  no
constitutional  principle  requiring  the  government  to  divulge
information it possesses. The suit here is claiming that some
constitutional principle (presumably the First Amendment) is
violated  by  the  statute.  This  amounts  to  a  claim  that
government is sometimes required by the First Amendment to
divulge information that it possesses. However, the Supreme
Court has never squarely found that the First Amendment ever
requires the release of government information.
The  First  Amendment  does,  however,  prevent  government
from  imposing  a  “prior  restraint,”  that  is,  from  prohibiting
private  individuals  (including  the  media)  from  publishing
information that they possess, except in the most extraordinary
instances  (e.g.,  troop  movements  in  time  of  war).  So  if  the
statute did prohibit a newspaper from publishing information
it  already  possessed  about  the  businessman  (or  about  the
prosecution’s  decision  not  to  prosecute  him),  the  statute
would  almost  certainly  violate  this  prohibition  on  prior
restraints.  Since  (C)  is  the  only  choice  that  distinguishes
between  compelling  the  disclosure  by  the  government  of
information  it  holds,  and  publication  of  privately-held
information that originally comes from government records, it
is the correct choice.
(A) is wrong because the answer doesn’t address the issue the
court  would  address.  This  choice  sounds  as  though  it  would
be relevant in defending against an equal protection claim, but
it is irrelevant to defending against a First Amendment claim.
For  instance,  if  the  statute  prohibited  newspapers  from
publishing  the  name  of  any  person  prosecuted  and  not
convicted, the fact that it treated those who are acquitted the
same as those against whom filed charges are dropped would

159

be completely irrelevant — the statute would still be a prior
restraint that violated the First Amendment.

(B)  is  wrong  because  even  if  the  press  doesn’t  have  greater
rights  than  citizens  generally,  this  would  not  be  a  defense
against the claim here. First, it’s not clear whether the press
has greater rights than those of citizens generally — the Court
has never definitively decided this. Second, even if the press
didn’t  have  greater  rights,  that  wouldn’t  necessarily  help  the
state  defend  the  statute;  for  instance,  a  court  might  hold  that
anyone — newspaper  or  private  citizen — had  the  right  to
compel  disclosure  of  this  information.  So  the  argument  is
irrelevant to the attack that’s been made here.

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  represents  a  more  extreme  position
than the Court has ever endorsed. There are a few Court cases
(e.g., Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia (1989)) that seem to
suggest that the press may have some limited right of access to
certain  types  of  government-controlled  information  (e.g.,
contents  of  certain  trials),  if  the  state  interest  in  non-
disclosure  is  weak.  So  Choice  (D),  by  indicating  that  no
legislative  objective  is  ever  too  weak  to  justify  a  sealing  of
governmental records, probably goes too far.

CHAPTER 10
FREEDOM OF RELIGION

I.    THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE

A.  Three-part test

1.  Incidental benefit not fatal

Question 64:  A  city  operates  a  cemetery  pursuant  to  a  city
ordinance.  The  ordinance  requires  the  operation  of  the  city
cemetery to be supported primarily by revenues derived from
the sale of cemetery lots to individuals. The ordinance further
provides that the purchase of a cemetery lot entitles the owner
to perpetual care of the lot, and entitles the owner to erect on
the  lot,  at  the  owner’s  expense,  a  memorial  monument  or
marker  of  the  owner’s  choice,  subject  to  certain  size
restrictions.  The  ordinance  requires  the  city  to  maintain  the
cemetery, including mowing the grass, watering flowers, and
plowing  snow,  and  provides  for  the  expenditure  of  city  tax
funds  for  such  maintenance  if  revenues  from  the  sale  of
cemetery lots are insufficient. Although cemetery lots are sold
at full fair market value, which includes the current value of
perpetual care, the revenue from the sale of such lots has been
insufficient  in  recent  years  to  maintain  the  cemetery.  As  a
result, a small amount of city tax funds has also been used for
that purpose.

A  group  of  city  taxpayers  brings  suit  against  the  city
challenging  the  constitutionality  of  the  city  ordinance  insofar
as it permits the owner of a cemetery lot to erect a religious
memorial monument or marker on his or her lot.
Is this suit likely to be successful?
(A)    No,  because  only  a  small  amount  of  city  tax  funds  has

been used to maintain the cemetery.

(B)    No,  because  the  purpose  of  the  ordinance  is  entirely
secular,  its  primary  effect  neither  advances  nor  inhibits
religion, and it does not foster an excessive government
entanglement with religion.

(C)  Yes, because city maintenance of any religious object is a

161

violation  of  the  Establishment  Clause  of  the  First
Amendment  as 
the  Fourteenth
Amendment.

incorporated 

into 

(D)    Yes,  because  no  compelling  governmental  interest
justifies  authorizing  private  persons  to  erect  religious
monuments or markers in a city-operated cemetery.
Answer  64:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  This  choice  correctly
states  the  three-part  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman  (1970)  test  for
government  action  that  is  alleged  to  benefit  some  religious
interest.  On  the  facts  here,  the  statute  passes  all  three  parts:
There  is  no  evidence  that  the  city’s  decision  to  operate  the
cemetery  under  these  rules  was  intended  to  benefit  religious
groups; the primary effect of the cemetery operation is not to
benefit those who put religious monuments on their plot; and
the  city’s  work  in  maintaining  the  religious  monuments  is  so
incidental to the overall operation of the cemetery — and so
comparable  to  the  work  needed  to  maintain  non-religious
is  no  excessive  entanglement
monuments — that 
between government and religion.

there 

(A) is wrong because the amount of government funds spent is
not  dispositive;  if  the  city  was  intending  to  benefit  only
religion  (e.g.,  by  providing  a  $20  reimbursement  to  the  first
100 people who bought a piece of religious jewelry), the fact
that only a “small amount” of city funds was spent would not
save 
the
the  expenditure  from  being  a  violation  of 
Establishment Clause.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  test  for  Establishment
Clause violations; a city may maintain a “religious object” if
the maintenance is part of a religiously-neutral program that is
not  intended  to,  and  does  not  have  the  primary  effect  of,
benefiting religion.
(D)  is  wrong  because,  if  the  government  acts  neutrally  as  to
religion  (as  it  has  done  here),  there  is  no  Establishment
Clause  violation  whether  the  government  has  pursued  a
compelling interest or not.

II.   THE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE

A.  Generally-applicable laws

162

1.  State need not tolerate serious impairment of important state

interest

Question  65:  Members  of  a  religious  group  believe  in
Lucifer  as  their  Supreme  Being.  The  members  of  this  group
meet  once  a  year  on  top  of  Mt.  Snow,  located  in  a  U.S.
National  Park,  to  hold  an  overnight  encampment  and  a
midnight  dance  around  a  large  campfire.  They  believe  this
overnight  encampment  and  all  of  its  rituals  are  required  by
Lucifer to be held on the top of Mt. Snow. U.S. National Park
Service rules that have been consistently enforced prohibit all
overnight camping and all campfires on Mt. Snow because of
the  very  great  dangers  overnight  camping  and  campfires
would  pose  in  that  particular  location.  As  a  result,  the  park
superintendent  denied  a  request  by  the  group  for  a  permit  to
conduct  these  activities  on  top  of  Mt.  Snow.  The  park
superintendent,  who  was  known  to  be  violently  opposed  to
cults and other unconventional groups had, in the past, issued
permits  to  conventional  religious  groups  to  conduct  sunrise
services in other areas of that U.S. National Park.

The  group  brought  suit  in  federal  court  against  the  U.S.
National  Park  Service  and  the  superintendent  of  the  park  to
compel issuance of the requested permit.

As a matter of constitutional law, the most appropriate result
in this suit would be a decision that denial of the permit was

(A)    invalid,  because  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First
Amendment  prohibits  the  Park  Service  from  knowingly
interfering with religious conduct.

(B)  invalid, because these facts demonstrate that the action of
invidiously

the  Park  Service  purposefully 
discriminated against the group.

and 

(C)    valid,  because  the  Establishment  Clause  of  the  First
religious

the  holding  of 

Amendment  prohibits 
ceremonies on federal land.

(D)    valid,  because  religiously  motivated  conduct  may  be
subjected  to  nondiscriminatory  time,  place,  and  manner
restrictions that advance important public interests.
Answer  65:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Government  may  take
generally-applicable  actions  that  advance  important  public

163

interests,  without  giving  an  exemption  to  those  whose
religious  beliefs  are  thereby  burdened.  The  facts  tell  us  that
the  rules  against  overnight  camping  and  campfires  are
“consistently  enforced”  because  of  “very  great  dangers,”  so
the  “generally  applicable”  and  “advancement  of  important
public  interests”  standards  are  met  here.  The  fact  that  the
superintendent doesn’t like cults doesn’t matter, because there
is no indication that his decision to deny the permit here was
motivated  by  anything  other  than  a  desire  to  enforce  these
generally-applicable rules.

(A)  is  wrong,  for  the  same  reason  that  (D)  is  right:
Government  may  impose  a  generally-applicable  rule  to
promote an important interest, even if government knows that
its  enforcement  of  that  rule  will  interfere  with  religious
conduct.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  Park  Service’s  action  did  not
“purposely  and  invidiously  discriminate”  against  the  group 
— what was being enforced was a generally-applicable rule
that was not enacted for anti-religious purposes.
(C)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  law  governing  the
Establishment Clause as well as the facts — if non-religious
groups were permitted to take the same general type of action
in  question  (here,  overnight  camping  and  campfires),  which
they  are  not,  then  it  would  not  be  a  violation  of  the
Establishment Clause for the government to allow a religious
group to do the same thing (and, indeed, it would probably be
a  violation  of  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  for  the  government
not to allow the religious group to do the same thing that the
non-religious groups are permitted to do).

CHAPTER 11
JUSTICIABILITY

I.    STANDING

A.  Cases not based on taxpayer or citizen status

1.  “Injury in fact”

a.  Imminent harm

Question 66:  An  ordinance  of  a  city  requires  that  its  mayor
must have been continuously a resident of the city for at least
five years at the time he or she takes office. The plaintiff, who
is  thinking  about  running  for  mayor  in  an  election  that  will
take place next year, will have been a resident of the city for
only four and one-half years at the time the mayor elected then
takes office. Before he decides whether to run for the position
of  mayor,  the  plaintiff  wants  to  know  whether  he  could
lawfully assume that position if he were elected. As a result,
the  plaintiff  files  suit  in  the  local  federal  district  court  for  a
declaratory judgment that the five-year-residence requirement
is  unconstitutional  and  that  he  is  entitled  to  a  place  on  his
political party’s primary election ballot for mayor. He names
the  chairman  of  his  political  party  as  the  sole  defendant  but
does not join any election official. The chairman responds by
joining  the  plaintiff  in  requesting  the  court  to  declare  the
residence requirement invalid.

In this case, the court should

(A)  refuse to determine the merits of this suit, because there is

no case or controversy.

(B)    refuse  to  issue  such  a  declaratory  judgment,  because  an
issue of this kind involving only a local election does not
present a substantial federal constitutional question.
(C)    issue  the  declaratory  judgment,  because  a  residency
requirement  of  this  type  is  a  denial  of  the  equal
protection of the laws.

(D)  issue the declaratory judgment, because the plaintiff will
residency

substantially  complied  with 

the 

have 
requirement.

165

Answer  66:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  plaintiff  does  not
meet  the  requirement  of  “injury  in  fact.”  He  clearly  has  not
been  injured  yet;  the  real  question  is  whether  he  faces
sufficiently imminent injury from the residency requirement. A
court would likely hold that because the plaintiff has not yet
even made the decision to run, and could not be injured unless
he decided to run, any threatened injury to him is too uncertain
and  speculative  to  meet  the  requirement  that  prospective
injury be reasonably concrete and imminent. The fact that the
chairman  has  joined  the  suit  does  not  change  this,  since  the
chairman  (and  the  chairman’s  party)  would  not  be  injured
unless  some  actual  candidate  was  blocked  by  the  residency
requirement, and there is no such candidate now.

(B)  is  wrong  because:  (1)  the  absence  of  a  case  or
controversy would prevent the court even from getting to the
issue of whether there was a substantial federal constitutional
question in the case; and (2) the fact that something is a local
election  does  not  prevent  it  from  presenting  a  substantial
federal  constitutional  question  (for  instance,  an  unduly  long
residency  requirement  probably  would  constitute  a  violation
of an actual candidate’s equal protection rights).

(C)  is  wrong  because,  while  the  residency  restriction  might
well constitute an equal protection violation of the rights of an
actual candidate, the plaintiff’s lack of actual-candidate status
prevents him from raising a case or controversy.

(D) is wrong because there is no basis (certainly not a federal
constitutional  basis) 
that
“substantially  complying,”  rather  than  fully  complying,  with
the residency requirement here would be sufficient.

the  court 

for 

B.  Third-party standing

Question  67:  City  police  officers  shot  and  killed  the
plaintiff’s friend as he attempted to escape arrest for an armed
robbery  he  had  committed.  The  plaintiff  brought  suit  in
federal  district  court  against  the  city  police  department  and
the  city  police  officers  involved,  seeking  only  a  judgment
declaring  unconstitutional  the  state  statute  under  which  the
police acted. That newly enacted statute authorized the police
to  use  deadly  force  when  necessary  to  apprehend  a  person

166

who  has  committed  a  felony.  In  his  suit,  the  plaintiff  alleged
that  the  police  would  not  have  killed  his  friend  if  the  use  of
deadly force had not been authorized by the statute.

The federal district court should

(A)    decide  the  case  on  its  merits,  because  it  raises  a

substantial federal question.

(B)    dismiss  the  action,  because  it  involves  a  nonjusticiable

political question.

(C)  dismiss the action, because it does not present a case or

controversy.

(D)    dismiss  the  action,  because  the  Eleventh  Amendment
prohibits federal courts from deciding cases of this type.
Answer 67: Choice (C)  is  correct.  Because  the  only  person
whose rights have been arguably affected by the new statute is
the  friend,  who  is  not  a  claimant,  there  is  no  live  case  or
controversy  between  the  litigants,  so  standing  rules  prevent
the court from hearing it.

(A) is wrong because the lack of standing prevents the court
from deciding the case on its merits even though the plaintiff
is  claiming  that  the  Constitution  has  been  violated  (which
would of course raise a federal question if there were a case
or controversy before the court).
(B) is wrong because, if there were not any standing problem,
the question of the constitutionality of the statute would not be
a  nonjusticiable  political  question  (a  category  limited  to  a
few special situations, none of which applies here).

(D)  is  wrong,  because  the  Eleventh  Amendment  bars  only
suits seeking money damages against states, and the suit here
is seeking a declaratory judgment rather than money damages.

II.   RIPENESS

A.  Reasonable probability of harm required

1.  Specificity required

Question  68:  The  legislature  of  the  state  of  Gray  recently
enacted  a  statute  forbidding  public  utilities  regulated  by  the
Gray Public Service Commission to increase their rates more

167

than  once  every  two  years.  Economy  Electric  Power
Company,  a  public  utility  regulated  by  that  commission,  has
just  obtained  approval  of  the  commission  for  a  general  rate
increase.  Economy  Electric  has  routinely  filed  for  a  rate
increase  every  10  to  14  months  during  the  last  20  years.
Because  of  uncertainties  about  future  fuel  prices,  the  power
company cannot ascertain with any certainty the date when it
will need a further rate increase; but it thinks it may need such
an increase sometime within the next 18 months.

Economy Electric files an action in the federal district court
in Gray requesting a declaratory judgment that this new statute
of  Gray  forbidding  public  utility  rate  increases  more  often
than  once  every  two  years  is  unconstitutional.  Assume  no
federal statute is relevant.

In this case, the court should

(A) 

  hold  the  statute  unconstitutional,  because  such  a
moratorium  on  rate  increases  deprives  utilities  of  their
property without due process of law.

(B)  hold the statute constitutional, because the judgment of a
legislature on a matter involving economic regulation is
entitled to great deference.

(C)  dismiss the complaint, because this action is not ripe for

decision.

(D)  dismiss the complaint, because controversies over state-
regulated  utility  rates  are  outside  of  the  jurisdiction
conferred  on  federal  courts  by  Article  III  of  the
Constitution.

Answer  68:  The  correct  choice  is  (C).  This  is  a  classic
ripeness issue: Economy does not know that it will certainly
(or  even  more-probably-than-not)  need  another  rate  increase
in  less  than  the  now-required  two-year  minimum.  All  we
know  is  that  Economy  “may”  need  the  increase  sometime  in
the next 18 months. Therefore, it is highly uncertain for now
whether Economy will ever be harmed by the statute, making
it likely that the court would dismiss the action as unripe.
(A) is wrong because the case is not ripe for decision (see the
discussion  of  Choice  (C)),  so  the  court  will  never  reach  the
constitutional  merits.  (Also,  it’s  highly  doubtful  that  a

168

relatively  brief  moratorium  on  rate  increases  would  violate
the due process rights of a utility.)

(B) is wrong for the same reason as (A): The case is not ripe
for decision (see the discussion of Choice (C)), so the court
will never reach the constitutional merits.

(D)  is  wrong,  because  the  federal  judicial  power  extends  to
any  case  raising  an  issue  under  the  federal  Constitution  or  a
federal  statute,  and  the  fact  that  the  controversy  involves
state- regulated utility rates does not prevent that controversy
from  raising  a  federal  issue.  For  example,  if  a  state  utility
commission  were  to  prevent  a  utility  from  ever  raising  its
rates  again,  this  would  raise  a  serious  taking-without-just-
compensation constitutional issue.

III.  THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT AND SUITS

AGAINST THE STATES

A.  The Eleventh Amendment generally

1.  Congress can’t override

a.  Exception for remedial powers

Question 69: A federal statute enacted pursuant to the power
of  Congress  to  enforce  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibits
any  state  from  requiring  any  of  its  employees  to  retire  from
state  employment  solely  because  of  their  age.  The  statute
expressly  authorizes  employees  required  by  a  state  to  retire
from state employment solely because of their age to sue the
state  government  in  federal  district  court  for  any  damages
resulting  from  that  state  action.  On  the  basis  of  this  federal
statute, a retiree who had worked for State X sues the state in
federal district court. State X moves to dismiss the suit on the
ground  that  Congress  lacks  authority  to  authorize  such  suits
against a state.
Which  of  the  following  is  the  strongest  argument  that  the
retiree can offer in opposition to the state’s motion to dismiss
this suit?
(A)    When  Congress  exercises  power  vested  in  it  by  the
Fourteenth Amendment, Congress may enact appropriate

remedial  legislation  expressly  subjecting  the  states  to
private suits for damages in federal court.

(B)    When  Congress  exercises  power  vested  in  it  by  any
provision  of  the  Constitution,  Congress  has  unlimited
authority to authorize private actions for damages against
a state.

(C)    While  the  Eleventh  Amendment  restrains  the  federal
judiciary,  that  Amendment  does  not  limit  the  power  of
Congress to modify the sovereign immunity of the states.
(D)  While the Eleventh Amendment applies to suits in federal
court  by  citizens  of  one  state  against  another  state,  it
does not apply to such suits by citizens against their own
states.

Answer 69: Choice (A) is correct. The Eleventh Amendment
generally forbids the federal courts from entertaining damage
suits  against  states,  and  Congress  cannot  override  this  ban
even  when  it  is  acting  pursuant  to  some  enumerated  power
(e.g.,  the  Commerce  Clause).  But  there  is  one  exception:
When  Congress  is  using  its  special  powers  to  enforce  the
post-Civil  War  amendments  (the  Thirteenth,  Fourteenth  and
Fifteenth), it may authorize damage suits against the states that
would otherwise be barred by the Eleventh Amendment. That
is what’s happening here.

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  is  overbroad.  As  a  general  rule
Congress,  even  where  it  is  acting  pursuant  to  some  power
given to it by a specific provision in the Constitution, may not
override  the  state  immunity  from  federal-court  damage  suits
conferred  by  the  Eleventh  Amendment;  enforcement  of  the
post-Civil  War  amendments  represents  the  only  exception  to
this rule.
(C)  is  wrong  for  essentially  the  same  reason:  The  Eleventh
Amendment does generally limit the power of Congress (not
just  the  power  of  the  federal  judiciary)  to  modify  the
sovereign- immunity of the states, but the Supreme Court has
held  that  in  the  special  case  in  which  Congress  is  enforcing
the  post-Civil  War  amendments  this  general  limitation  on
Congress’s  power  does  not  apply.  Fitzpatrick  v.  Bitzer
(1976).

170

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  is  a  flat  misstatement  of  law:  The
Supreme Court has held that the Eleventh Amendment protects
a state from federal-court damage suits even where the suit is
brought  by  a  citizen  of  a  different  state.  Hans  v.  Louisiana
(1890).

CHAPTER 1
OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

I.    VALIDITY OF PARTICULAR KINDS OF OFFERS

A.  Public offers and advertisements

Question  1:  On  November  1,  the  following  notice  was
posted in a privately operated law school:

                              The faculty, seeking to encourage legal research, offers to any student at this school who wins the
current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers
must be submitted to the Dean’s office before May 1.

(The national competition is conducted by an outside agency,
unconnected with any law school.) A student read this notice
on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make
his  paper  on  obscenity  law,  which  he  started  in  October,  a
winner. The student also left on a counter in the dean’s office
a  signed  note  saying,  “I  accept  the  faculty’s  $500  Obscenity
Competition offer.” This note was inadvertently placed in the
student’s  file  and  never  reached  the  dean  or  any  faculty
member  personally.  On  the  following  April  1,  the  above
notice was removed and the following substituted therefore:

                              The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be

withdrawn.

The  student’s  paper  was  submitted  through  the  dean’s  office
on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that the student had
won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of

173

$1,000. The law faculty refused to pay anything.

Assuming that the faculty’s notice of November 1 was posted
on  a  bulletin  board  or  other  conspicuous  place  commonly
viewed  by  all  persons  in  the  law  school,  such  notice
constituted a

(A)    preliminary  invitation  to  deal,  analogous  to  newspaper
advertisements for the sale of goods by merchants.

(B)  contractual offer, creating a power of acceptance.
(C)    preliminary  invitation,  because  no  offeree  was  named

therein.

(D)  promise to make a conditional, future gift of money.
Answer 1: Choice (B) is correct, because it accurately states
that  the  notice  fulfills  the  requirements  of  a  public  offer.  A
public  offer  requires  sufficient  definiteness  to  qualify  as  an
offer  at  all.  The  key  factors  to  consider  are  whether  it
contains  the  language  of  an  offer,  and  a  quantity  term.  (If  it
doesn’t, it will be considered merely an invitation for offers.)
Here, the offer was specific as to quantity — only one student
could  win — and  it  contains  the  language  of  a  promise 
— “The  faculty  .  .  .  offers.”  As  such,  the  notice  creates  an
offer for a unilateral contract, which any student could accept
by  winning  the  competition,  having  completed  performance
with knowledge of the offer.

(A)  is  wrong,  because  the  notice  was  sufficiently  definite  to
constitute  an  offer.  The  key  here  is  distinguishing  a  public
offer  from  an  invitation  for  offers,  which  most  ads  are.  The
distinction  is  important  because  a  public  offer  creates  a
power  of  acceptance  in  offerees,  such  that  if  an  offeree
accepts, a binding contract will be formed. An invitation for
offers,  on  the  other  hand,  doesn’t  give  anyone  the  power  to
create a binding contract.
The thing that normally makes an ad an invitation instead of an
offer is that it is indefinite, specifically in terms of the lack of
language of a promise and quantity. That’s not the case here.
The  notice  is  specific  as  to  quantity  (only  one  student  could
win), price ($500), and is worded as a promise (“The faculty
.  .  .  offers”).  As  such,  it  creates  an  immediate  power  of
acceptance  in  any  student,  such  that  if  a  student  wins  the

174

competition,  having  completed  performance  with  knowledge
of the offer, the faculty will be bound. (Note that the offer is
for  a  unilateral  contract,  since  it  can  only  be  accepted  by
performance,  not  a  return  promise.)  Since  choice  A
mischaracterizes  the  notice  as  only  an  invitation  to  deal,  it’s
not the best response.

(C)  is  wrong,  because  failure  to  identify  the  offeree,  in  the
context of a public offer, would not destroy the offer. While a
typical offer must identify the offeree, a public offer (like the
offer  of  a  reward)  cannot,  by  dint  of  its  nature,  identify  the
offeree. However if the communication is sufficiently definite
(i.e., it contains the language of an offer, and a quantity term),
it’s  an  offer  nonetheless.  The  November  1  notice  satisfied
these requirements.

(D) is wrong because the promise made by the faculty in the
notice was a bargain promise, not a conditional  promise  to
make  a  gift.  This  is  an  important  distinction,  because  a
conditional  promise  to  make  a  gift  is  not  enforceable,
whereas a bargain promise, when it’s in the form of an offer
(as here), creates the power of acceptance in an offeree.
The  difference  between  the  two  turns  on  whether  the  parties
consider  fulfilling  the  condition  as  the  “price”  of  accepting
the promise; if they do, it’s an enforceable, bargain promise.
If not, it’s a conditional promise to make a gift. Say the facts
were  different,  and  there  had  been  no  November  1  notice;
instead, the first the student heard from the school was a note
he  received  from  the  law  school  dean  after  winning  the
contest,  saying,  “Congratulations  on  winning  the  obscenity
contest. I have a check from the school for $500 for you, and
I’ll give it to you if you come to my office at 2 p.m.” This is a
conditional promise, because the dean intended to make a gift,
and the student’s going to the office couldn’t be construed as a
bargained-for “price” of the promise to pay $500. Under the
facts as they are in the question, however, things are entirely
different.  It’s  clear  that  both  the  faculty  and  the  student
considered  the  condition  stated — winning  the  contest — as
the  bargained-for  performance  by  which  the  offer  of  $500
could be accepted. Thus, the promise was a bargain promise
for  a  unilateral  contract,  which  the  student  accepted  by

175

winning  the  contest  (having  completed  performance  with
knowledge  of  the  offer).  Since  D  mischaracterizes  the
promise, it’s not the best response.

II.   THE ACCEPTANCE

A.  Method of acceptance

1.  Offer invites either promise or performance

a.  Shipment of goods

i.  Acceptance by shipment of non-conforming goods

Question  2:  A  retailer  ordered  from  a  produce  wholesaler
500  bushels  of  No.  1  Royal  Fuzz  peaches,  at  a  specified
price,  “for  prompt  shipment.”  The  wholesaler  promptly
shipped  500  bushels,  but  by  mistake  shipped  No.  2  Royal
Fuzz  peaches  instead  of  No.  1.  The  error  in  shipment  was
caused by the negligence of the wholesaler’s shipping clerk.

Which  of  the  following  best  states  the  retailer’s  rights  and
duties upon delivery of the peaches?

(A)    The  wholesaler’s  shipment  of  the  peaches  was  a

counteroffer and the retailer can refuse to accept them.

(B)    The  wholesaler’s  shipment  of  the  peaches  was  a
counteroffer  but,  since  peaches  are  perishable,  the
retailer,  if  it  does  not  want  to  accept  them,  must  reship
the  peaches  to  the  wholesaler  in  order  to  mitigate  the
wholesaler’s losses.

(C)    The  retailer  must  accept  the  peaches  because  a  contract

was formed when the wholesaler shipped them.

(D)    Although  a  contract  was  formed  when  the  wholesaler
shipped the peaches, the retailer does not have to accept
them.

Answer 2: Choice (D) is correct. The retailer’s order was an
offer. The wholesaler’s shipment of goods in response to the
offer  was  an  acceptance,  even  though  what  the  wholesaler
shipped was non-conforming goods. That’s so because UCC §
2-206(1)(b) says that “an order or other offer to buy goods for
prompt  or  current  shipment  shall  be  construed  as  inviting
acceptance  .  .  .  by  the  prompt  or  current  shipment  of

176

conforming  or  non-conforming  goods[.]”  A  buyer  who
receives  non-conforming  goods  has  the  right  to  reject  those
goods, sending them back to the seller or holding them for the
seller’s  pickup.  That’s  because  UCC  §  2-601  says  that,
subject to some limitations not applicable here, “If the goods
or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to the
contract, the buyer may (a) reject the whole; or (b) accept the
whole; or (c) accept any commercial unit or units and reject
the  rest.”  So  the  retailer  could  reject  all  or  some  of  the
bushels.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  wholesaler’s  shipment  was  not  a
counteroffer,  since  nothing  in  the  facts  surrounding  the
shipment  indicated  that  the  wholesaler  was  rejecting  the
retailer’s offer (its order). Instead, the wholesaler’s shipment
was an acceptance (as well as a breach).

(B) is wrong because: (1) the wholesaler’s shipment was not
a  counteroffer  (for  the  reason  described  in  the  analysis  of
Choice  (A));  and  (2)  under  UCC  §  2-602(2),  if  the  retailer
wants  to  reject  rather  than  accept  the  peaches,  it  is  merely
required “after rejection to hold [the goods] with reasonable
care at the seller’s disposition for a time sufficient to permit
the  seller  to  remove  them.”  So  despite  the  peaches’
perishability,  all  that  the  retailer  has  to  do  is  to  promptly
notify  the  wholesaler,  “We  don’t  want  the  peaches  because
they don’t conform; we’ll hold them for you to pick up.”

the  wholesaler  shipped 

(C) is wrong because, although a contract was indeed formed
when 
their  non-
conformity to the retailer’s order entitled the retailer to reject
the goods rather than accept them.

the  peaches, 

b.  Accommodation shipment

Question 3: A retailer faxed the following signed message to
his  long-time  widget  supplier:  “Urgently  need  blue  widgets.
Ship  immediately  three  gross  at  your  current  list  price  of
$600.”  Upon  receipt  of  the  fax,  the  supplier  shipped  three
gross of red widgets to the retailer, and faxed to the retailer
the following message: “Temporarily out of blue. In case red
will  help,  am  shipping  three  gross  at  the  same  price.  Hope
you can use them.”

177

Upon the retailer’s timely receipt of both the shipment and the
supplier’s  fax,  which  of  the  following  best  describes  the
rights and duties of the retailer and the wholesaler?

(A)    The  retailer  may  accept  the  shipment,  in  which  case  he
must pay the wholesaler the list price, or he must reject
the  shipment  and  recover  from  the  wholesaler  for  total
breach of contract.

(B)    The  retailer  may  accept  the  shipment,  in  which  case  he
must pay the wholesaler the list price, or he may reject
the  shipment,  in  which  case  he  has  no  further  rights
against the wholesaler.

(C)    The  retailer  may  accept  the  shipment,  in  which  case  he
must pay the wholesaler the list price, less any damages
sustained because of the nonconforming shipment, or he
may reject the shipment and recover from the wholesaler
for  total  breach  of  contract,  subject  to  the  wholesaler’s
right to cure.

(D)    The  retailer  may  accept  the  shipment,  in  which  case  he
must pay the wholesaler the list price, less any damages
sustained because of the nonconforming shipment, or he
may  reject  the  shipment  provided  that  he  promptly
covers  by  obtaining  conforming  widgets  from  another
supplier.

(B) 

that 

the  shipment 

Answer  3:  Choice 
is  correct.  This  was  an
accommodation shipment under UCC § 2-206(1)(b) —  in the
words of that section, the supplier “seasonably notifie[d] the
buyer 
[was]  offered  only  as  an
accommodation  to  the  buyer.”  Therefore,  the  supplier’s
shipment  did  not  constitute  an  acceptance.  Instead,  it  was  a
counteroffer to sell three gross of red widgets. At that point,
the  retailer  could  choose  between  accepting  the  red  and
paying  for  them,  or  rejecting  the  red,  in  which  case  there
would  be  no  contract  (because  there  never  was  an  accepted
offer).

(A) is wrong because when a seller makes an accommodation
shipment,  the  buyer  has  the  right  to  reject  the  shipment  but
does not have the right to recover for breach. That’s because
the  shipment  is  not  an  acceptance  but  instead  a  counteroffer,
and the buyer’s rejection of the goods constitutes a rejection

178

of the counteroffer, with the result that there is no breach by
the seller for which the buyer could recover.

(C)  is  wrong  for  two  reasons:  (1)  if  the  retailer  accepts  the
shipment,  he  cannot  deduct  any  damages  because  of  the
nonconformity  (since  this  type  of  accommodation  shipment
constitutes  a  counteroffer  rather  than  acceptance,  making  the
buyer’s decision to keep the goods an acceptance of the goods
as  shipped,  meaning  that  the  nonconformity  to  the  original
order  is  irrelevant);  and  (2)  if  the  retailer  rejects  the
shipment,  he  has  simply  rejected  the  supplier’s  counteroffer,
and there is no breach for which the retailer can deduct.

(D)  is  wrong  for  two  reasons:  (1)  if  the  retailer  accepts  the
shipment,  he  cannot  deduct  any  damages  because  of  the
nonconformity  (for  the  reasons  described  in  the  analysis  of
Choice (C) above); and (2) if the retailer rejects the shipment,
he  may  do  so  without  covering  by  obtaining  conforming
widgets from someone else. (He may, for instance, decide that
he doesn’t need widgets of any color after all.)

2.  Notice of acceptance of unilateral contract

a.  Suretyship contracts

Question  4:  A  hardware  distributor  located  on  the  West
Coast  gave  its  customer,  a  hardware  retailer  who  was
relocating  to  the  East  Coast,  the  following  signed  “letter  of
introduction”  to  a  hardware  manufacturer  based  on  the  East
coast:

This  will  introduce  you  to  my  good  friend  and  former
customer, who is a retailer and will be seeking to arrange the
purchase  of  hardware  inventory  from  you  on  credit.  If  you
will let him have the goods, I will make good any loss up to
$25,000 in the event of his default.

The retailer presented the letter to the manufacturer, who then
sold and delivered $20,000 worth of hardware to the retailer
on  credit.  The  manufacturer  promptly  notified  the  distributor
of this sale.
Which  of  the  following  is  NOT  an  accurate  statement
concerning  the  arrangement  between  the  distributor  and  the
manufacturer?

179

(A)    It  was  important  to  enforceability  of  the  distributor’s
promise  to  the  manufacturer  that  it  be  embodied  in  a
signed writing.

(B)    By  extending  the  credit  to  the  retailer,  the  manufacturer
the  distributor’s  offer  for  a

effectively  accepted 
unilateral contract.

(C)    Although  the  distributor  received  no  consideration  from
the  retailer,  the  distributor’s  promise  is  enforceable  by
the manufacturer.
  The  distributor’s  promise  is  enforceable  by  the
manufacturer  whether  or  not  the  manufacturer  gave  the
distributor seasonable notice of the extension of credit to
the retailer.

(D) 

Answer 4:  Choice  (D)  is  correct  (i.e.,  the  statement  in  this
choice is not accurate). When the distributor wrote the letter
and  induced  the  customer  to  present  the  letter  to  the
manufacturer,  the  distributor  was  making  an  offer  for  a
unilateral contract — that is, it’s clear that the distributor was
expecting the manufacturer to accept (if he accepted at all) by
extending the credit, rather than promising the distributor that
he  would  extend  the  credit.  When  the  manufacturer  extended
the credit, this was an acceptance of the distributor’s offer by
performance,  so  the  distributor’s  guarantee  of  repayment
came into effect. However, because of the requirement that an
offeree  who  accepts  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract  must
ordinarily give prompt notice of acceptance to the offeror, if
the  manufacturer  had  not  given  the  distributor  prompt  notice
of  the  sale  (which  the  facts  say  he  did),  the  distributor’s
guarantee  duty  would  have  been  discharged.  Notice  that  it
was  up  to  you  to  spot  the  fact  that  this  was  an  offer  for  a
unilateral contract — the facts don’t highlight this, and if you
hadn’t noticed it yourself, you would probably not have seen
why notice by the manufacturer was important.
is  correct:  The
(A) 
distributor’s promise would not have been enforceable had it
not  been  embodied  in  a  signed  writing.  That’s  because  the
distributor’s  offer  was  a  promise  to  “answer  for  the  debt  of
another.” As such, it fell within the suretyship provision of the
Statute  of  Frauds,  and  was  therefore  required  to  be  in  a

is  wrong  because 

the  statement 

180

writing signed by the party to be charged (the distributor).

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  statement  is  correct:  As  the
discussion  of  Choice  (D)  describes,  the  distributor’s  offer
was an offer for a unilateral contract (i.e., one to be accepted
by  performance  rather 
the
manufacturer  accepted  that  offer  by  doing  the  requested  act,
i.e., extending credit to the retailer.

than  return  promise),  and 

to  have 

(C) is wrong because the statement is correct. It’s true that the
distributor  received  no  consideration  from  the  customer.
However,  the  distributor  received  consideration  from  the
manufacturer — the  distributor  bargained 
the
manufacturer  give  credit  to  the  customer,  and  got  the
performance he bargained for. (The fact that the performance
ran  to  the  customer  rather  than  to  the  distributor  [the
promisor]  does  not  prevent  it  from  being  consideration  to
support the distributor’s promise.) The customer was a third-
party beneficiary of the distributor’s promise, and in a third-
party  beneficiary  arrangement  the  fact  that  the  third-party
beneficiary does not give consideration to the promisor does
not make any difference.

III.  ACCEPTANCE VARYING FROM OFFER

A.  UCC view

1.  “Additional” term in acceptance

a.  Both merchants

i.  Materiality

Question  5:  On  June  1,  a  wholesaler  received  a  purchase-
order  form  from  a  retailer  and  new  customer,  in  which  the
latter ordered 1,000 anti-recoil widgets for delivery no later
than  August  30  at  a  delivered  total  price  of  $10,000,  as
quoted  in  the  wholesaler’s  current  catalog.  Both  parties  are
merchants with respect to widgets of all types. On June 2, the
wholesaler mailed to the retailer its own form, across the top
of  which  the  wholesaler’s  president  had  written,  “We  are
pleased to accept your order.” This form contained the same
terms  as  the  retailer’s  form  except  for  an  additional  printed
clause in the wholesaler’s form that provided for a maximum

181

liability of $100 for any breach of contract by the retailer.

As  of  June  5,  when  the  retailer  received  the  wholesaler’s
acceptance  form,  which  of  the  following  is  an  accurate
statement  concerning  the  legal  relationship  between  the
wholesaler and the retailer?

(A)    There  is  no  contract,  because  the  liability-limitation
clause  in  the  wholesaler’s  form  is  a  material  alteration
of the retailer’s offer.

(B)  There is no contract, because the retailer did not consent
to  the  liability-limitation  clause  in  the  wholesaler’s
form.

(C)  There is an enforceable contract whose terms include the
liability-limitation  clause  in  the  wholesaler’s  form,
because  liquidation  of  damages  is  expressly  authorized
by the Uniform Commercial Code.

(D)    There  is  an  enforceable  contract  whose  terms  do  not
include the liability-limitation clause in the wholesaler’s
form.

Answer  5:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Under  the  UCC,  a
purported  acceptance  document  will  not  be  prevented  from
operating as a true acceptance even though it states terms that
are additional to or different from those in the offer. UCC § 2-
207(1).  Therefore,  the  wholesaler’s  form  with  the  “We  are
please  to  accept”  language  on  it  operated  as  an  acceptance
even though it contained an additional term (the liability cap).
On the other hand, the liability cap was an “additional” term
(i.e., a term dealing with a subject that was not covered in the
retailer’s  offer).  When  the  offeror  and  offeree  are  both
merchants,  §  2-207(2)  says  that  an  additional  term  is  to  be
construed  as  a  “proposal  for  addition  to  the  contract,”  and
becomes  part  of  the  contract  unless  (1)  “the  offer  expressly
limits  acceptance  to  the  terms  of  the  offer”  (which  didn’t
happen here), (2) the additional term “materially alter[s]” the
contract,  or  (3)  the  offeror  promptly  notifies  the  offeree  that
the offeror objects to the additional term. Here, event (2) has
occurred:  A 
liability  cap  would  almost  certainly  be
considered by a court to be a “material alteration” of an offer
that did not contain any cap. Therefore, a contract was formed
but it did not include the liability cap.

182

(A) is wrong because, as explained in more detail in Choice
(D) above, while the liability-limitation clause was indeed a
material  alteration  of  the  offer,  this  fact  did  not  prevent  the
wholesaler’s  form  from  constituting  an  acceptance.  (The
wholesaler’s  form  meshed  sufficiently  with  the  retailer’s
offer form, and contained sufficient words of acceptance, that
it was a “definite . . . expression of acceptance” under UCC §
2-207(1) even though it contained the additional term.)

(B)  is  wrong  because  a  contract  was  formed  as  soon  as  the
wholesaler  sent  its  form,  and  whether  the  retailer  eventually
did  or  did  not  expressly  consent  to  the  liability-limitation
clause wouldn’t matter to the issue of whether a contract was
formed.  (As  explained  in  the  discussion  of  Choice  (D),  the
liability-limitation  clause,  since  it  was  a  material  alteration,
didn’t  become  part  of  the  contract  even  if  the  retailer
remained silent.)

(C) is wrong because, while it correctly says that a contract is
formed,  it  is  incorrect  in  stating  that  the  liability-limitation
clause  would  become  part  of  the  contract.  It’s  true  that  a
liquidation-of-damages  clause  can,  if  the  parties  agree  on  it
and it is reasonable, be enforced under the UCC. But such a
clause  won’t  enter  the  contract  unless  the  parties  somehow
agree  on  the  clause,  and  here,  because  the  proposed  clause
was  a  material  alteration,  the  retailer  won’t  be  presumed  to
have agreed from the mere fact that the clause was present on
the wholesaler’s acceptance and the retailer remained silent.

2.  Contract by parties’ conduct

a.  “Acceptance by conduct” can occur in non-UCC contracts

i.  Acts during course of extended negotiations

Question 6: A developer, needing a water well on one of his
projects,  met  several  times  about  the  matter  with  a  well
driller.  Subsequently,  the  driller  sent  the  developer  an
unsigned  typewritten  form  captioned  “WELL  DRILLING
PROPOSAL” and stating various terms the two had discussed
but not agreed upon, including a “proposed price of $5,000.”
The  form  concluded,  “This  proposal  will  not  become  a
contract until signed by you [the developer] and then returned
to and signed by me [the driller].”

183

The  developer  signed  the  form  and  returned  it  to  the  driller,
who neglected to sign it but promptly began drilling the well
at the proposed site on the developer’s project. After drilling
for two days, the driller told the developer during one of the
developer’s  daily  visits  that  he  would  not  finish  unless  the
developer  would  agree  to  pay  twice  the  price  recited  in  the
written proposal. The developer refused, the driller quit, and
the  developer  hired  a  substitute  driller  to  drill  the  well  to
completion for a price of $7,500.

In an action by the developer against the driller for damages,
which of the following is the probable decision?

(A)  The developer wins, because his signing of the driller’s
form constituted an acceptance of an offer by the driller.
(B)  The developer wins, because the driller’s commencement
of  performance  constituted  an  acceptance  by  the  driller
of an offer by the developer and an implied promise by
the driller to complete the well.

(C)  The driller wins, because he never signed the proposal as

(D) 

required by its terms.
  The  driller  wins,  because  his  commencement  of
performance  merely  prevented  the  developer  from
revoking  his  offer,  made  on  a  form  supplied  by  the
driller,  and  did  not  obligate  the  driller  to  complete  the
well.

Answer  6:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  driller’s  “proposal”
was  not  an  offer,  because  it  could  not  be  accepted  by  the
unilateral act of the recipient (since by its terms it could not
become  a  contract  until  it  was  not  only  signed  by  the
developer, the recipient, but also signed by the driller). When
the developer signed the form and returned it to the driller, the
developer was making an offer on the terms described in the
form. The driller could have accepted the offer by signing, but
didn’t  in  fact  sign.  However,  when  the  driller  started  work,
his  conduct  of  doing  the  work  described  in  the  form,  at  the
appropriate place, constituted an acceptance by conduct. This
acceptance-by-conduct included a promise (albeit an implied
one) to complete the work as described in the offer document
(the form that the driller didn’t sign).

184

(A)  is  wrong  because,  although  it  lists  the  correct  result,  it
explains  it  on  an  incorrect  legal  theory.  The  driller’s  form
could  not  be  an  offer,  because  the  provision  requiring  both
signatures  meant  that  the  unsigned  form  as  dispatched  by  the
driller  did  not  empower  the  recipient  (the  developer)  to
unilaterally  complete  the  deal  (i.e.,  accept)  by  signing.
Therefore,  the  developer’s  signature  created  an  offer,  not  an
acceptance.  (And  acceptance  did  not  occur  until  the  driller
accepted by conduct.)

(C) is wrong because, although the driller never accepted by
signature,  he  did  accept  by  his  conduct  of  starting  the  well
drilling.

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  effect  of  the  driller’s
commencement  of  performance.  That  commencement  of
performance  served  as  an  acceptance  of  the  contract,  and
thereby obligated the driller to complete his side of the deal.

IV.  DURATION OF THE POWER OF

ACCEPTANCE

A.  Irrevocable offers

1.  “Firm offers” under the UCC

Question  7:  On  December  15,  a  lawyer  received  from  a
stationer an offer consisting of its catalog and a signed letter
stating, “We will supply you with as many of the items in the
enclosed  catalog  as  you  order  during  the  next  calendar  year.
We assure you that this offer and the prices in the catalog will
remain  firm  throughout  the  coming  year.”  On  January  15,
having  at  that  time  received  no  reply  from  the  lawyer,  the
stationer notified the lawyer that, effective February 1, it was
increasing the prices of certain specified items in its catalog.
Is the price increase effective with respect to catalog orders
the  stationer  receives  from  the  lawyer  during  the  month  of
February?
(A)    No,  because  the  stationer’s  original  offer,  including  the
price  term,  became  irrevocable  under  the  doctrine  of
promissory estoppel.

185

(B)    No,  because  the  stationer  is  a  merchant  with  respect  to
office supplies; and its original offer, including the price
term, was irrevocable throughout the month of February.
(C)    Yes,  because  the  stationer  received  no  consideration  to

support its assurance that it would not increase prices.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  period  for  which  the  stationer  gave
assurance that it would not raise prices was longer than
three months.

Answer 7: Choice (B) is correct. This was a firm offer that
met  the  requirements  of  UCC  §  2-205,  since  it  was  (1)  by  a
merchant;  (2)  in  a  letter  signed  by  the  offeror;  and  (3)  it
promised  that  the  offeror  would  sell  all  items  at  the  catalog
price  for  a  year  (a  promise  to  hold  the  offer  open).  It’s  true
that  this  promise  of  irrevocability  didn’t  legally  extend
beyond  three  months  (despite  what  it  said),  but  the  three
months was enough to cover February.
(A)  is  wrong  because,  while  the  doctrine  of  promissory
estoppel  says  that  detrimental  reliance  by  the  offeree  may
render  an  offer  temporarily  irrevocable,  here  there  is  no
indication  that  the  lawyer  detrimentally  relied  on  the
stationer’s offer.
(C) is wrong because the UCC does not require consideration
for an offer to be irrevocable. The whole point of § 2-205’s
firm-offer  provision  is  that  qualifying  offers  by  merchants
will  be 
though  not  supported  by
consideration.

irrevocable  even 

(D)  is  wrong  because,  while  the  maximum  period  of
irrevocability  for  firm  orders  under  UCC  §  2-205  is  three
months,  when  an  offer  that  otherwise  meets  the  firm-offer
requirements promises more than three months’ irrevocability,
the offer will nonetheless be irrevocable for three months.

a.  Effect if not by a merchant

Question  8:  On  November  1,  Debbit,  an  accountant,  and
Barrister,  a  lawyer,  contracted  for  the  sale  by  Debbit  to
Barrister  of  the  law  books  Debbit  had  inherited  from  his
father. Barrister agreed to pay the purchase price of $10,000
when Debbit delivered the books on December 1.

186

On  November  10,  Barrister  received  a  signed  letter  from
Debbit  that  stated:  “I  have  decided  to  dispose  of  the  book
stacks containing the law books you have already purchased.
If you want the stacks, I will deliver them to you along with
the books on December 1 at no additional cost to you. Let me
know before November 15 whether you want them. I will not
sell  them  to  anyone  else  before  then.”  Debbit  was  not  a
merchant with respect to either law books or book stacks.

On November 12 Debbit told Banister that he had decided not
to part with the stacks. Will this communication operate as a
legally effective revocation of his offer to deliver the stacks?

(A)    Yes,  because  Barrister  had  a  pre-existing  obligation  to

pay $10,000 for the law books.

(B)  Yes, because Debbit was not a merchant with respect to

book stacks.

(C)  No, because Debbit had given a signed assurance that the

offer would be held open until November 15.

(D)  No, because by delaying his acceptance until November
14,  Barrister  detrimentally  relied  on  Debbit’s  promise
not to sell the stacks to anyone else in the meantime.
Answer  8:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  An  offer  is  revocable
unless  some  special  circumstance  makes  it  irrevocable.  The
contract here is covered by the UCC, making §2-205’s firm-
offer  provision  potentially  applicable.  However,  §2-205
applies  only  to  “an  offer  by  a  merchant.”  We  are  told  that
Debbit  is  not  a  merchant  with  respect  to  either  lawbooks  or
book  stacks.  Therefore,  his  offer  was  not  a  firm  offer  and
could be revoked at any time. Consequently, his statement on
November 12 that he had decided not to part with the stacks
was a legally operative revocation.

(A)  is  wrong  because  Barrister’s  pre-existing  obligation  to
pay  $10,000  for  the  law  books  is  irrelevant  on  the  issue  of
whether  Debbit’s  offer  about  the  stacks  was  irrevocable.
Debbit’s  offer  was  an  offer  to  modify  the  contract,  and  that
offer was not rendered irrevocable merely because Barrister
had  previously  given  consideration  (his  promise  to  pay
$10,000)  to  support  Debbit’s  prior  promise  to  sell  the  law
books.

187

(C)  is  wrong  because  an  offer  is  not  rendered  irrevocable
merely  because  the  offer  is  signed  and  states  that  it  is
irrevocable. Under the UCC, a signed offer that says it will be
irrevocable  will  be  so  under  some  circumstances,  but  as
explained  above  those  circumstances  include  a  requirement
that the offeror be a merchant.

(D)  is  wrong  because  Barrister  did  not  in  fact  detrimentally
rely. If Barrister had detrimentally relied on Debbit’s promise
not  to  sell  the  stacks  to  someone  else,  this  reliance  might
indeed  have  caused 
temporarily
the  offer 
irrevocable.  But  a  mere  delay  in  accepting  is  not  the  sort  of
temporary
detrimental 
irrevocability.

that  will  suffice 

to  become

2.  Part performance or detrimental reliance

a.  Offer for unilateral contract

Question 9: While waiting in line to open an account with a
bank,  a  customer  read  a  poster  on  the  bank’s  wall  that  said,
“New Customers! $25 FOR 5 MINUTES. If you stand in line
for  more  than  five  minutes,  we  will  pay  you  $25!  We  like
happy customers! (This offer may be withdrawn at any time.)”
The customer started timing his wait and just as five minutes
was about to pass, the bank manager tore the poster down and
announced,  “The  $25  stand-in-line  promotion  is  over.”  The
customer  waited  in  line  for  10  more  minutes  before  being
served.

In  the  customer’s  action  against  the  bank  for  $25,  will  the
customer prevail?

(A)    No,  because  the  bank  withdrew  its  offer  before  the

customer completed the requested performance.

(B)    No,  because  the  bank’s  statement  was  a  nonbinding  gift

promise.

(C)  Yes, because the bank could not revoke its offer once the

customer had commenced performance.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  customer’s  presence  in  line  served  as

notice to the bank that he had accepted.

Answer  9:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Where  an  offer  invites
acceptance  by  performance,  the  offeree’s  beginning  of

188

performance  creates  an  option  contract,  which  precludes  the
offeror from revoking its offer.

See Rest. 2d, § 45. The customer’s beginning to wait in line
created  the  option  contract,  which  couldn’t  be  revoked  as
long  as  the  customer  continued  to  wait.  Notice  that  this  fact
pattern  is  exactly  like  the  famous  law-school  hypothetical,
“I’ll  pay  you  $10  if  you  cross  the  Brooklyn  Bridge,”  where
once the offeree starts to cross, the offeror can’t revoke while
the  offeree  is  still  trying  to  finish.  You  might  think  that  the
“This  offer  may  be  withdrawn  at  any  time”  language  would
change  the  result;  but  a  court  would  likely  interpret  this  to
apply only to customers who hadn’t yet started to wait on line
at the moment the offer was withdrawn. See, e.g., Rest. 2d §
45,  Comment  b,  saying  that  the  “option  contract”  effect
“yields  to  a  manifestation  of  intention  which  makes  reliance
unjustified.  A  reservation  of  power 
to  revoke  after
performance has begun means that as yet there is no promise
and  no  offer”;  the  reservation  of  power  to  revoke  here  was
not  a  reservation  to  revoke  “after  performance  [i.e.,  waiting
on line] has begun,” so the right-to-withdraw language would
be interpreted to be inapplicable to the customer here.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  bank’s  offer  was  an  offer  for  a
unilateral contract (i.e., an offer that was to be accepted by a
performance  rather  than  by  a  promise),  and  an  offer  for  a
unilateral contract becomes temporarily irrevocable once the
offeree has begun to perform. See Choice (C).

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  consideration  required  for  an
enforceable contract is present. The bank’s promise to pay the
customer $25 and the customer’s standing in line constituted a
bargained-for exchange. See Rest. 2d, § 71: A performance is
consideration  if  it  is  “bargained  for,”  and  a  performance  is
bargained for if it is “sought by the promisor [here, the bank]
in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee [the
customer] in exchange for that promise.”
(D) is wrong because it misstates the legal significance of the
customer’s presence in line. The offer here was an offer for a
unilateral contract, that is, an offer that was to be accepted by
performance  (waiting  in  line  for  more  than  5  minutes).
Therefore,  while  the  customer’s  mere  presence  in  line

189

constituted the beginning of performance, it did not constitute
full  performance  (i.e.,  standing  in  line  for  more  than  five
minutes), which was the only way the customer could accept.
It’s true that one who accepts an offer for a unilateral contract
must  sometimes  give  notice  of  acceptance-by-performance;
but  that’s  true  only  where  the  offeror  would  not  otherwise
know of the performance (which is not the case here). And in
any event, the required notice would be notice of completed
performance, not notice of the beginning of performance.

CHAPTER 2
CONSIDERATION

I.    THE BARGAIN ELEMENT

A.  Promises to make gifts

1.  Existence of condition

a.  Mixture of bargain and gift

Question  10:  Rollem,  an  automobile  retailer,  had  an  adult
daughter, Betsy, who needed a car in her employment but had
only  $3,000  with  which  to  buy  one.  Rollem  wrote  to  her,
“Give me your $3,000 and I’ll give you the car on our lot that
we  have  been  using  as  a  demonstrator.”  Betsy  thanked  her
father  and  paid  him  the  $3,000.  As  both  Rollem  and  Betsy
knew, the demonstrator was reasonably worth $10,000. After
Betsy  had  paid  the  $3,000,  but  before  the  car  had  been
delivered  to  her,  one  of  Rollem’s  sales  staff  sold  and
delivered the same car to a customer for $10,000. Neither the
salesperson  nor  the  customer  was  aware  of  the  transaction
between Rollem and Betsy.
Does Betsy, after rejecting a tendered return of the $3,000 by
Rollem, have an action against him for breach of contract?

(A)    Yes,  because  Rollem’s  promise  was  supported  by

bargained-for consideration.

(B)    Yes,  because  Rollem’s  promise  was  supported  by  the
moral  obligation  a  father  owes  his  child  as  to  the
necessities of modern life.

(C)    No,  because  the  payment  of  $3,000  was  inadequate

consideration to support Rollem’s promise.

(D)  No, because the salesperson’s delivery of the car to the
customer made it impossible for Rollem to perform.
Answer 10: Choice (A) is correct. Where a transaction is a
mixture of a bargain and a gift, the consideration requirement
is  satisfied.  That  is  the  case  where,  as  here,  one  party
promises  to  sell  the  other  an  item  at  a  deep  discount  from
market.  Since  Rollem  was  unquestionably  bargaining  for

191

Betsy’s  payment  of  $3,000,  the  fact  that  this  payment  was
much  less  than  the  market  price  does  not  prevent  Betsy’s
payment from being consideration for Rollem’s promise.

(B) is wrong as a matter of consideration doctrine, because a
promise  that  is  made  on  account  of  moral  obligation  is  not
supported  by  consideration.  Furthermore,  it  is  doubtful  that
contract  law  would  regard  a  father  as  having  any  sort  of
obligation,  even  a  moral  one,  to  supply  his  adult  daughter
with a car.

(C)  is  wrong  because  contract  law  does  not  consider  the
adequacy  of  consideration,  as  long  as  the  bargain  and
detriment  of  elements  are  satisfied.  So  here,  since  Rollem
clearly bargained for Betsy’s $3,000, the fact that this amount
was arguably “inadequate” won’t matter.

(D) is wrong because the defense of impossibility would not
apply on these facts. Where a seller, acting through his agent,
sells  the  contracted-for  goods  to  someone  else,  this  action
will  be  viewed  as  being  voluntary  on  the  seller’s  part,  and
therefore  not  the  sort  of  involuntary  event  to  which  the
impossibility doctrine applies.

II.   THE “DETRIMENT” ELEMENT

A.  Generally

1.  Motives irrelevant

Question 11: A small-business owner encourages “wellness”
on  the  part  of  his  employees  and  supports  various  physical-
fitness  programs  to  that  end.  Learning  that  one  of  his
employees  was  a  dedicated  jogger,  the  business  owner
promised  to  pay  the  jogger  a  special  award  of  $100  if  she
could and would run one mile in less than six minutes on the
following  Saturday.  The  jogger  thanked  him,  and  did  in  fact
run  a  mile  in  less  than  six  minutes  on  the  day  specified.
Shortly  thereafter,  however,  the  business  owner  discovered
that for more than a year the jogger had been running at least
one  mile  in  less  than  six  minutes  every  day  as  a  part  of  her
personal fitness program. He refused to pay the $100.

In  an  action  by  the  jogger  against  the  business  owner  for

192

breach  of  contract,  which  of  the  following  best  summarizes
the probable decision of the court?

(A)    The  business  owner  wins,  because  it  is  a  compelling
inference  that  the  business  owner’s  promise  did  not
induce the jogger to run the specified mile.

(E)  The business owner wins, because the jogger’s running of
the specified mile was beneficial, not detrimental, to her
in any event.

(F)  The jogger wins, because running a mile in less than six

minutes is a significantly demanding enterprise.

(G)    The  jogger  wins,  because  she  ran  the  specified  mile  as

requested, and her motives for doing so are irrelevant.
Answer 11: Choice (D) is correct. The only way the business
owner can conceivably win is if he can show that his promise
was  not  supported  by  consideration.  But  the  business  owner
bargained for the jogger’s act of running the six-minute mile.
Since  the  business  owner  received  the  bargained  act,  the
consideration  requirement  was  satisfied.  The 
jogger’s
motives  in  doing  the  act — including  the  fact  that  she  would
have  done  the  act  anyway  without  the  business  owner’s
request — are indeed irrelevant, as this choice states.

(A) is wrong because it would not matter even if the business
owner’s  promise  did  not  induce  the  jogger  to  run  the  mile.
The business owner bargained for a six-minute mile to be run
by the jogger, and got it; that’s all that matters. So the fact that
the  jogger  would  have  run  that  mile  on  that  day  anyway  is
irrelevant.

(B)  is  wrong  because  even  in  courts  still  interpreting  the
consideration  doctrine  to  include  a  requirement  that  the
promisee  undergo  a  “detriment,”  all  that  is  required  is  a
“legal  detriment.”  “Legal  detriment”  is  really  shorthand  for
“any act, forbearance or promise.” The fact that the requested
act,  forbearance  or  promise  would  be  of  “benefit”  to  the
promisee  is  irrelevant.  Since  the  jogger  performed  the
requested act, the fact that the doing of that act may have been
a benefit to her health therefore doesn’t matter.
(C)  is  wrong  because  it  explains  the  correct  result  with
incorrect reasoning. Since the jogger performed the requested

193

act, she satisfies the “act, forbearance or promise” aspect of
the consideration requirement whether or not the requested act
was “significantly demanding” for her.

B.  Pre-existing duty rule

1.  Modification

Question  12:  On  May  1,  a  landowner  telegraphed  an
investor,  “Will  sell  you  any  or  all  of  the  lots  in  Grove
subdivision  at  $5,000  each.  Details  follow  in  letter.”  The
letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of
payment, insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, “This offer
remains open until June 1.” On May 2, after the investor had
received  the  telegram  but  before  he  had  received  the  letter,
the  investor  telegraphed  the  landowner,  “Accept  your  offer
with respect to lot 101.” Both parties knew that there were 50
lots  in  the  Grove  subdivision  and  that  they  were  numbered
101 through 150.
On May 3, the landowner telephoned the investor, saying that
because  he  had  just  discovered  that  a  shopping  center  was
going  to  be  erected  adjacent  to  the  Grove  subdivision,  he
would “have to have $6,000 for each of the lots, including lot
101.”  During  the  telephone  call,  the  investor  agreed  to  pay
him $6,000 for lot 101. On May 6, the investor telegraphed,
“Accept  your  offer  with  respect  to  the  rest  of  the  lots.”
Assuming that the two contracts were formed and that there is
no  controlling  statute,  the  investor  will  most  likely  be
required to pay

(A)  only $5,000 for each of the 50 lots.
(B)  only $5,000 for lot 101, but $6,000 for the remaining 49

lots.

(C)  $6,000 for each of the 50 lots.
(D)  $6,000 for lot 101, but only $5,000 for the remaining 49

lots.

the  common 

law  rules  on 

Answer  12:  Choice  (B)  is  correct,  because  it  correctly
applies 
irrevocability  and
modifications  to  these  facts.  First,  you  have  to  determine
whether the common law or the UCC will control. Since it’s
the sale of land that’s involved, not a transaction in goods, the
common law will control.

194

Second, you have to analyze what each communication does.
The first is the landowner’s May 1 telegram to the investor. It
is sufficiently definite to constitute an offer to sell any or all
lots in the subdivision for $5,000 each. The investor’s May 2
telegram to the landowner constituted an acceptance as to lot
101 at $5,000, and probably implicitly rejected the offer as to
the other 49 lots. As a result, the landowner’s offer as to all
the  other  lots  terminated,  because  his  original  offer  to  keep
the  offer  open  until  June  1  was  not  supported  by
consideration,  so  it  was  revocable.  Even  if  the  investor’s
acceptance  as  to  lot  101  didn’t  terminate  the  offer,  the
landowner’s  subsequently  raising  the  price  to  $6,000  did
revoke the original offer and created a new one, at $6,000.

Thus, the price on the latter 49 lots was $6,000. The original
lot, number 101, had a price of $5,000, because the investor
originally  accepted  at  that  price.  Once  the  investor  accepted
at  $5,000,  there  was  a  contract  formed  as  to  lot  101.  The
subsequent  change  to  $6,000  was  thus  a  modification,  and
since  there  was  no  consideration,  the  modification  as  to  lot
101  is  unenforceable  under  the  pre-existing  duty  rule.  As  a
result, the contract price is $5,000 for lot 101 and $6,000 for
the rest.
This  question  indicates  why  it’s  so  important  to  segregate
UCC and non-UCC cases before you analyze them. Here, the
rule on modifications under the UCC is very different from the
common  law.  Under  UCC  §  2-209,  modifications  are  valid
without  consideration  as  long  as  they  are  in  good  faith.  At
common  law,  consideration  is  required  under  the  “pre-
existing  duty”  rule.  As  to  irrevocability,  at  common  law,
consideration  is  required  to  form  an  option  contract;  under
UCC  §  2-205,  merchants  can  make  irrevocable,  or  “firm”
offers,  without  consideration.  Both  of  these  would  lead  you
astray on these facts. However, since B correctly applies the
common law rules, it’s the best response.
(A) is wrong, because it ignores the fact that only lot 101 is
subject  to  the  $5,000  offer — the  remaining  lots  will  cost
$6,000. The landowner’s May 1 telegram to the investor was
sufficiently definite to constitute an offer to sell any or all lots
in  the  subdivision  for  $5,000  each.  The  investor’s  May  2

195

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

telegram to the landowner constituted an acceptance as to lot
101 at $5,000, and probably implicitly rejected the offer as to
the other 49 lots. As a result, the landowner’s offer as to all
the  other  lots  terminated,  because  his  original  offer  to  keep
the  offer  open  until  June  1  was  not  supported  by
consideration,  so  it  was  revocable.  Even  if  the  investor’s
acceptance  as  to  lot  101  didn’t  terminate  the  offer  as  to  the
other  49,  the  landowner’s  subsequently  raising  the  price  to
$6,000 did revoke the original offer and created a new one, at
$6,000. Thus, the price on the latter 49 lots was $6,000. Any
contract  for  these  49  (which  we’re  told  was  created)  would
thus have been at $6,000, not $5,000.

(C) is wrong, because it ignores the fact that lot 101 will only
cost $5,000, although this choice is correct in stating that the
other  49  will  be  $6,000  each.  The  landowner’s  May  1
telegram to the investor was sufficiently definite to constitute
an  offer  to  sell  any  or  all  lots  in  the  subdivision  for  $5,000
each.  The  investor’s  May  2  telegram  to  the  landowner
constituted  an  acceptance  as  to  lot  101  at  $5,000.  The
landowner’s  subsequent  change  to  $6,000  was  thus  an
attempted modification of a completed contract as to lot 101,
and since there was no consideration for the modification, at
common law the modification as to lot 101 was unenforceable
under the pre-existing duty rule. As a result, the contract price
remained  $5,000  for  lot  101.  Therefore,  this  choice  is
incorrect  in  implying  that  the  contract  price  for  lot  101  is
$6,000.

(D) is wrong, because it doesn’t correctly state the price as to
either  lot  101  or  the  remaining  49  lots — in  fact,  it  has  the
prices reversed. Since it’s the sale of land that’s involved, not
a  transaction  in  goods,  the  common  law  (not  the  UCC)  will
control.
The  landowner’s  May  1  telegram  to  the  investor  was
sufficiently definite to constitute an offer to sell any or all lots
in  the  subdivision  for  $5,000  each.  The  investor’s  May  2
telegram to the landowner constituted an acceptance as to lot
101 at $5,000, and probably rejected the offer as to the other
49 lots. As a result, the landowner’s offer as to all the other
lots  terminated,  because  his  original  offer  to  keep  the  offer

196

open  until  June  1  was  not  supported  by  consideration,  so  it
was revocable. Even if the investor’s acceptance as to lot 101
didn’t  terminate  the  offer,  the  landowner’s  subsequently
raising  the  price  to  $6,000  did  revoke  the  original  offer  and
created a new one, at $6,000, for the other 49 lots.

Thus, the price on the latter 49 lots was $6,000. The original
lot, number 101, had a price of $5,000, because the investor
originally  accepted  at  that  price.  Once  the  investor  accepted
at  $5,000,  there  was  a  contract  formed  as  to  lot  101.  The
subsequent  change 
thus  an  attempted
to  $6,000  was 
modification  as  to  lot  101,  and  since  there  was  no
consideration  for  that  modification,  the  modification  was
unenforceable under the pre-existing duty rule. As a result, the
contract price is $5,000 for lot 101 and $6,000 for the rest.

If you chose this response, you probably mistakenly believed
the modification as to lot 101 was valid, but that the original
offer as to the other lots was irrevocable. Since neither one of
these  is  true,  due  to  operation  of  the  common  law  rules  on
modifications 
(not  valid  without  consideration)  and
irrevocable  offers  (no  irrevocability  without  consideration),
D is completely wrong.

Question  13:  An  accountant  entered  into  a  contract  with  a
painter  by  the  terms  of  which  the  painter  was  to  paint  the
accountant’s office for $1,000 and was required to do all of
the  work  over  the  following  weekend  so  as  to  avoid
disruption of the accountant’s business.

If  the  painter  had  started  to  paint  on  the  following  Saturday
morning,  he  could  have  finished  before  Sunday  evening.
However, he stayed home that Saturday morning to watch the
final  game  of  the  World  Series  on  TV,  and  did  not  start  to
paint until Saturday afternoon. By late Saturday afternoon, the
painter realized that he had underestimated the time it would
take  to  finish  the  job  if  he  continued  to  work  alone.  The
painter  phoned  the  accountant  at  her  home  and  accurately
informed  her  that  it  was  impossible  to  finish  the  work  over
the weekend unless he hired a helper. He also stated that to do
so would require an additional charge of $200 for the work.
The  accountant  told  the  painter  that  she  apparently  had  no
choice but to pay “whatever it takes” to get the work done as

197

scheduled.

The painter hired a helper to help finish the painting and paid
the helper $200. The accountant has offered to pay the painter
$1,000. The painter is demanding $1,200.

How much is the painter likely to recover?

(A)    $1,000  only,  because  the  accountant  received  no
consideration for her promise to pay the additional sum.
(B)    $1,000  only,  because  the  accountant’s  promise  to  pay
“whatever it takes” is too uncertain to be enforceable.
(C)    $1,200,  in  order  to  prevent  the  accountant’s  unjust

enrichment.

(D)    $1,200,  because  the  impossibility  of  the  painter’s
completing  the  work  alone  discharged  the  original
contract and a new contract was formed.

Answer  13:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  If  parties  to  an  existing
contract  agree  to  modify  the  contract  for  the  sole  benefit  of
one of them, the modification will usually be unenforceable in
non-UCC cases, for lack of consideration. That’s because of
the  pre-existing  duty  rule:  When  one  party  to  an  existing
contract  makes  an  additional  promise,  and  the  other  party
merely promises to do what she is already required to do, the
former’s  promise  is  not  supported  by  consideration.  A
primary  function  of  the  pre-existing  duty  rule  is  to  refuse  to
reward “hold-up” behavior by a provider of services, who in
the  middle  of  the  contract  refuses  to  complete  performance
unless he gets a better price or other improved terms. That’s
exactly  what  happened  here:  The  painter  has  unfairly
extracted the $200 promise from the accountant when it’s too
late for the accountant to get a substitute. So the accountant’s
promise  will  be  unenforceable  unless  some  exception  to  the
pre-existing  duty  rule  applies.  Two  common  exceptions  are
that: (1) there were unanticipated circumstances that made the
painter’s request for more money not unreasonable, or (2) the
painter  agreed  to  do  some  additional  duty  beyond  what  he
was  already  required  to  do.  But  neither  of  these  exceptions
(or  any  other)  applies  here,  so  the  pre-existing  duty  rule
applies  and  the  accountant’s  promise  is  unenforceable  for
lack of consideration.

198

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  accountant’s  promise  is  not  too
uncertain.  The  parties  were  not  agreeing  to  a  charge  of
“whatever it takes” — they were instead agreeing to a charge
of  $200,  with  the  accountant’s  “whatever  it  takes”  remark
being  more  in  the  nature  of  a  side  commentary  (e.g.,  “I’m
agreeing  to  the  $200  because  I  would  in  fact  agree  to
whatever it took to get you to finish the work.”).

(C)  is  wrong  because  letting  the  accountant  escape  from  her
$200-extra-compensation  promise  would  not  lead  to  her
unjust  enrichment.  The  painter  is  only  doing  exactly  what  he
always  agreed  to  do  for  exactly  the  price  the  two  parties
agreed  to,  so  depriving  him  of  his  unfairly  extracted  extra
$200 would not constitute unjust enrichment to the accountant.

(D)  is  wrong  because  a  party’s  inability  to  complete
performance  due  to  that  party’s  own  delay  or  poor  planning
does not constitute the sort of extraordinary and unanticipated
occurrence  to  which  the  impossibility  doctrine  applies.  In
general, only “external” events (e.g., an act of God, a strike,
etc.) will qualify for the impossibility defense.

a.  Unanticipated circumstances

Question  14:  A  contractor  contracted  with  a  warehouse
owner  to  construct  for  $500,000  a  warehouse  and  an  access
driveway  at  highway  level  on  the  owner’s  property.  Shortly
after commencing work on the driveway, which required for
the  specified  level  some  excavation  and  removal  of  surface
material,  the  contractor  unexpectedly  encountered  a  large
mass  of  solid  rock.  The  contractor  informed  the  owner
(accurately)  that  because  of  the  rock  the  driveway  as
specified would cost at least $20,000 more than figured, and
demanded for that reason a total contract price of $520,000.
Since  the  owner  was  expecting  warehousing  customers
immediately  after  the  agreed  completion  date,  he  signed  a
writing  promising  to  pay  the  additional  $20,000.  Following
timely  completion  of  the  warehouse  and  driveway,  which
conformed to the contract in all respects, the owner refused to
pay the contractor more than $500,000.
What  is  the  maximum  amount  to  which  the  contractor  is
entitled?

199

(A)    $500,000,  because  there  was  no  consideration  for  the

owner’s promise to pay the additional $20,000.

(B)    $500,000,  because  the  owner’s  promise  to  pay  the

additional $20,000 was exacted under duress.

(C)    $520,000,  because  the  modification  was  fair  and  was
made in the light of circumstances not anticipated by the
parties when the original contract was made.

(D)    $520,000,  provided  that  the  reasonable  value  of  the

the  modification 

contractor’s total performance was that much or more.
Answer 14: Choice (C) is correct. Although the general rule
is 
is
that  a  modification  solely  benefiting  one  party 
unenforceable  due  to  lack  of  consideration,  there  is  a  very
important  exception:  If 
is  “fair  and
equitable  in  view  of  circumstances  not  anticipated  by  the
parties  when  the  contract  was  made,”  the  modification  will
be  binding  without  consideration.  That  is  the  case  here:  the
large amount of rock was a “circumstance not anticipated by
the  parties  when  the  contract  was  made,”  and  the  $20,000
seems to have been a fair estimate of the increased cost to the
the
contractor 
contractor  gave  no  consideration  for  the  owner’s  promise  to
pay the extra $20,000 (the contractor merely promised to do
what he was already obligated to do, i.e., build the warehouse
and driveway) is irrelevant.

in  performing.  Therefore, 

the  fact 

that 

(A)  is  wrong  because,  although  it  is  true  that  there  was  no
consideration  for  the  owner’s  promise  to  pay  the  additional
$20,000, the absence of consideration does not matter for the
reason explained in the discussion of Choice (C).

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  contractor’s  request  for  the  extra
$20,000 would not be deemed by a court to have constituted
duress. If no rock had been discovered, and the contractor had
demanded the extra $20,000 merely because he knew that the
owner  was  time-sensitive  and  vulnerable,  this  choice  would
probably be correct in result and reasoning. But because the
facts make it clear that the $20,000 was merely an adjustment
on account of the unanticipated cost of excavating the rock, no
duress will be found.
(D)  is  wrong  because  it  gives  the  wrong  explanation  for  the

200

correct result. Even if the reasonable value of the contractor’s
total  performance  was  $520,000  or  greater,  the  contractor
would not receive the extra $20,000 if the increase was due
to the owner’s desperation to have the project completed on
time  rather  than  due  to  an  unanticipated  circumstance  (the
rock) — in  that  case  the  requirement  of  consideration  would
render  the  modification  unenforceable  regardless  of  the
“value” of the total performance.

2.  Duty owed to third person rather than to promisor

Question  15:  A  burglar  stole  Collecta’s  impressionist
painting  valued  at  $400,000.  Collecta,  who  had  insured  the
painting  for  $300,000  with  Artistic  Insurance  Co.,  promised
to pay $25,000 to Snoop, a full-time investigator for Artistic,
if  he  effected  the  return  of  the  painting  to  her  in  good
condition. By company rules, Artistic permits its investigators
to  accept  and  retain  rewards  from  policyholders  for  the
recovery  of  insured  property.  Snoop,  by  long  and  skillful
detective  work,  recovered  the  picture  and  returned  it
undamaged to Collecta.

If Collecta refuses to pay Snoop anything, and he sues her for
$25,000,  what  is  the  probable  result  under  the  prevailing
modern rule?

(A)    Collecta  wins,  because  Snoop  owed  Artistic  a  pre-

existing duty to recover the picture if possible.

(B)  Collecta wins, because Artistic, Snoop’s employer, had a
pre-existing  duty  to  return  the  recovered  painting  to
Collecta.

(C)    Snoop  wins,  because  Collecta  will  benefit  more  from
return  of  the  $400,000  painting  than  from  receiving  the
$300,000 policy proceeds.

(D)  Snoop wins, because the pre-existing duty rule does not
apply  if  the  promisee’s  (Snoop’s)  duty  was  owed  to  a
third person.

Answer  15:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  If  the  promisee  merely
does or promises to do what the promisee is already legally
obligated to  the  promisor  to  do,  under  the  pre-existing  duty
rule  that  performance  or  return  promise  does  not  serve  as
consideration  for  the  promisor’s  promise.  But  this  rule  does

201

not  apply  where  the  promisee  does  or  promises  to  do
something that is already legally owed not to the promisor but
to  some  third  person.  This  exception  applies  here,  since
Snoop (the promisee) does not owe any contractual duty to the
promisor (Collecta), merely to a third party (Artistic).

(A)  is  wrong  because,  while  Snoop  indeed  owed  Artistic  a
pre-existing  duty  to  recover  the  picture  if  possible,  no  duty
was owed to the promisor (Collecta), and that’s what matters,
as explained in the discussion of Choice (D) above.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  Artistic  may  have  had  a
pre-existing duty to return the recovered painting to Collecta
is irrelevant, since it is not Artistic that was the promisee of
Collecta’s  promise  of  a  bonus  (Snoop  was).  For  the  pre-
existing duty rule to apply it must be the promisee who has the
pre-existing duty (and who owes that duty to the promisor).

(C) is wrong because it states an irrelevant fact. The issue is
whether the pre-existing duty rule applies, and the fact that the
promisor  would  receive  some  net  benefit  if  the  promisee
performed the act he was already legally obligated to perform
does  not  render  the  pre-existing  rule  inapplicable.  (Virtually
every  time  the  promisor  makes  a  promise  in  return  for  the
promisee’s  performance  of  an  already-owed  duty, 
the
promisor  expects  to  do  better  than  if  the  promisee  didn’t
perform,  otherwise  the  promisor  wouldn’t  be  making  the
promise;  yet  the  pre-existing  duty  rule  applies  to  these
situations.)

3.  Agreement to accept part payment of debt

a.  Disputed debt

Question  16:  In  a  written  contract,  an  architect  agreed  to
draw  up  the  plans  for  and  to  supervise  construction  of  a
client’s  new  house.  In  return,  the  client  agreed  to  pay  the
architect  a  fee  of  $10,000  to  be  paid  upon  the  house’s
completion. After completion, the client claimed erroneously
but in good faith that the architect’s plans were defective. The
client  orally  offered  to  pay  the  architect  $7,500  in  full
settlement  of  the  claim  for  the  fee.  The  architect  orally
accepted  that  offer  despite  the  fact  that  the  reasonable  value
of  his  services  was  in  fact  $10,000.  The  client  paid  the

202

architect $7,500 pursuant to their agreement.

The  architect  subsequently  sued  the  client  for  the  remaining
$2,500.  In  a  preliminary  finding,  the  trier  of  fact  found  that
there were no defects in the architect’s plans.

Will the architect be likely to prevail in his action against the
client for $2,500?

(A) 

  Yes,  because  payment  of  $7,500  cannot  furnish
consideration for the architect’s promise to surrender his
claim.

(B)    Yes,  because  the  oral  agreement  to  modify  the  written

contract is not enforceable.

(C)    No,  because  the  architect’s  promise  to  accept  $7,500
became binding when the client made the payment.
(D)  No, because the architect’s acceptance of partial payment

constituted a novation.

to  encourage  settlements:  Where  either  (a) 

Answer 16: Choice (C) is correct. It’s true that under the pre-
existing duty rule, as a general matter a party who promises to
accept less than the amount or other performance he is owed
has  not  received  consideration  for  that  promise.  So,  for
instance,  a  creditor  with  an  unquestionably-valid  liquidated
claim who agrees to accept partial payment won’t be bound.
But all courts recognize an important exception to this rule, in
order 
the
creditor’s  claim  (or  a  defense  to  it)  is  in  fact  of  uncertain
validity; or (b) the debtor honestly believes that the claim may
be invalid (or that the debtor’s defense may be valid), then the
creditor’s agreement to take partial payment is  supported  by
consideration,  namely  the  debtor’s  promise  to  pay  a  lesser
amount. And that’s true even if it later turns out that the claim
was valid and/or the defense was invalid. See Rest. 2d, §74.
(In  this  situation,  the  settlement  agreement  is  an  “executory
accord,”  which  becomes  a  completed  “accord-and-
satisfaction”  when  the  agreed-upon  partial  payment  is  made,
thereby  extinguishing  the  creditor’s  original  claim  for  the
whole amount.)
That’s  exactly  what  happened  here:  The  client  believed  in
good faith (even though, as it turned out, erroneously) that she
had  a  valid  defense,  based  on  the  defectiveness  of  the

203

architect’s performance. Her agreement to pay the architect’s
claim in return for a $2,500 discount was thus a surrender of
her good-faith potential defense, and that surrender furnished
consideration  for  the  architect’s  return  promise  to  give  the
discount.  Therefore,  the  architect’s  promise  to  give  the
discount  was  binding  on  him,  as  an  executory  accord  that
became  a  completed  accord-and-satisfaction  at  the  moment
the client paid the $7,500.

is  wrong  because  of 

the  special  rule  validating
(A) 
compromises  of  claims  that  are  disputed  in  good  faith.  The
rule of Foakes v. Beer, which is a specific application of the
pre-existing  duty  rule,  provides  that  a  promise  to  accept
partial payment of a liquidated and undisputed debt is invalid
for a lack of consideration. The rule does not apply, however,
where  there  is  a  compromise  of  a  claim  disputed  in  good
faith. This exception applies even if it later becomes apparent
that  the  reason  for  disputing  the  claim  was  invalid.  See  the
analysis of Choice (C) for more information.

(B) is wrong for two reasons. First, there is nothing in these
facts  that  makes  the  Statute  of  Frauds  applicable,  as  this
choice suggests. Oral contracts are valid unless the situation
falls  within  one  of  the  enumerated  Statute  of  Frauds
categories,  which  this  one  does  not.  Oral  modifications  are
ordinarily binding as long as neither the original contract nor
the  contract-as-modified  falls  within  the  Statute  of  Frauds.
And the fact that the original contract was in writing does not
change this. If the written contract had contained a “No Oral
Modifications”  clause,  then  this  clause  would  have  been
enforceable  to  make  an  oral  modification  (such  as  a
modification  of  the  price)  unenforceable.  But  there  is  no
indication  in  these  facts  that  a  N.O.M.  clause  was  present.
Furthermore,  even  if  there  was  a  N.O.M.  clause,  it’s  likely
that  the  court  would  conclude  that  full  performance  (the
payment of the agreed-upon lesser sum, and its acceptance by
the architect) caused the N.O.M. clause to become ineffective.
Second,  even  if  the  original  contract  had  been  within  the
Statute  of  Frauds,  full  performance  by  both  parties — the
architect’s doing of the work, and the client’s payment to the
agreed-upon  lesser  sum — would  have  caused  the  Statute  of

204

Frauds  to  disappear  as  a  defense  anyway.  (See  Rest.  2d,
§145.)

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  facts  here  did  not  involve  a
novation.  A  novation  arises  where  either  one  or  both  of  the
parties  to  a  contract  is  replaced  by  a  third party.  See  Rest.
2d,  §  280.  The  architect’s  acceptance  of  payment  does  not
constitute a novation, since neither the client nor the architect
was replaced by a third party.

b.  Cashing of check tendered as settlement

i.  How tested on the MBE

Question 17: A client consulted a lawyer about handling the
sale  of  the  client’s  building,  and  asked  the  lawyer  what  her
legal fee would be. The lawyer replied that her usual charge
was  $100  per  hour,  and  estimated  that  the  legal  work  on
behalf of the client would cost about $5,000 at that rate. The
client  said,  “Okay;  let’s  proceed  with  it,”  and  the  lawyer
timely  and  successfully  completed  the  work.  Because  of
unexpected  title  problems,  the  lawyer  reasonably  spent  75
hours on the matter and shortly thereafter mailed the client a
bill  for  $7,500,  with  a  letter  itemizing  the  work  performed
and time spent. The client responded by a letter expressing his
good-faith belief that the lawyer had agreed to a total fee of
no  more  than  $5,000.  The  client  enclosed  a  check  in  the
amount  of  $5,000  payable  to  the  lawyer  and  conspicuously
marked, “Payment in full for legal services in connection with
the  sale  of  [the  client’s]  building.”  Despite  reading  the
“Payment  in  full  .  .  .”  language,  the  lawyer,  without  any
notation  of  protest  or  reservation  of  rights,  endorsed  and
deposited the check to her bank account. The check was duly
paid  by  the  client’s  bank.  A  few  days  later,  the  lawyer
unsuccessfully  demanded  payment  from  the  client  of  the
$2,500  difference  between  the  amount  of  her  bill  and  the
check, and now sues the client for that difference.
What, if anything, can the lawyer recover from the client?

(A)  Nothing, because the risk of unexpected title problems in
a  real-property  transaction  is  properly  allocable  to  the
seller’s attorney and thus to the lawyer in this case.
(B)    Nothing,  because  the  amount  of  the  lawyer’s  fee  was

205

disputed  in  good  faith  by  the  client,  and  the  lawyer
impliedly agreed to an accord and satisfaction.

(C)  $2,500, because the client agreed to an hourly rate for as
many hours as the work reasonably required, and the sum
of $5,000 was merely an estimate.

contained 

communication 

(D)  The reasonable value of the lawyer’s services in excess
of  $5,000,  if  any,  because  there  was  no  specific
agreement on the total amount of the lawyer’s fee.
Answer 17: Choice (B) is correct. UCC § 3-311 deals with
the  effect  of  a  creditor’s  cashing  of  an  “in  full  settlement”
partial-payment check. To get the protection of § 3-311 (i.e.,
to  have  the  creditor’s  cashing  of  the  check  constitute  full
settlement),  the  debtor  must  show  that:  (1)  the  check  or
accompanying  written 
a
“conspicuous  statement  to  the  effect  that  the  instrument  was
tendered as full satisfaction of the claim,” (2) the underlying
claim was either “unliquidated” or “subjected to a bona fide
dispute,” and (3) the debtor acted in good faith. Here, all of
these  requirements  are  met,  since:  (1)  we’re  told  that  the
check was “conspicuously marked, ‘Payment in full’”; (2) the
parties  had  a  real  dispute  about  whether  the  $5,000  initially
quoted by the lawyer was merely a non-binding estimate or a
binding  cap;  and  (3)  we’re  expressly  told  that  the  client’s
letter  expressed  his  “good-faith  belief”  that  the  lawyer  had
quoted  the  $5,000  as  a  cap.  Therefore,  when  the  lawyer
cashed  the  check,  her  doing  so  constituted  an  implied
agreement to an accord and satisfaction of her claim, under §
3-311.  Note  that  this  result  would  still  occur  even  if  the
lawyer had placed a notation of protest or of reservation-of-
rights on the check before cashing it.
(A) is wrong for two reasons: (1) the “rule of law” it purports
to state about the risk of loss probably would not be accurate
even  in  the  absence  of  the  lawyer’s  cashing  the  partial-
payment  check;  and  (2)  under  UCC  §  3-311,  the  cashing  of
that  check  constituted  a  settlement,  for  the  reasons  stated  in
the discussion of Choice (B) above.
(C)  is  wrong  because  it  is  not  clear  that  the  $5,000  figure
quoted  by  the  lawyer  was  merely  an  estimate — in  the
absence of the check-cashing, a court might well have found

206

that  the  client  reasonably  understood  the  figure  to  be  a  firm
cap  (i.e.,  an  upper  bound)  on  the  amount  that  the  lawyer
would  charge,  in  which  case  the  cap  would  have  been
deemed part of the contract.

(D) is wrong for two reasons: (1) there may indeed have been
a  specific  agreement  on  the  total  amount  of  the  lawyer’s  fee
(the facts are indeterminate about whether this would be true,
in the absence of the partial-check-cashing); and (2) when the
lawyer cashed the check, the case became governed by UCC §
3-311, not the parties’ original agreement, whatever that was.

Question 18: Ames had painted Bell’s house under a contract
which  called  for  payment  of  $20,000.  Bell,  contending  in
good  faith  that  the  porch  had  not  been  painted  properly,
refused to pay anything.

On  June  15,  Ames  mailed  a  letter  to  Bell  stating,  “I  am  in
serious need of money. Please send the $20,000 to me before
July  1.”  On  June  18,  Bell  replied  “I  will  settle  for  $18,000
provided you agree to repaint the porch.” Ames did not reply
to this letter.

Thereafter, Bell mailed a check for $18,000 marked “Payment
in full on the Ames-Bell painting contract as per letter dated
June  18.”  Ames  received  the  check  on  June  30.  Because  he
was badly in need of money, Ames cashed the check without
objection and spent the proceeds but has refused to repaint the
porch.

After  cashing  the  check  Ames  sued  Bell  for  $2,000.  Ames
probably will

(A)    succeed  if  he  can  prove  that  he  had  painted  the  porch

according to specifications.

(B)    succeed,  because  he  cashed  the  check  under  economic

duress.

(C)  not succeed, because he cashed the check.
(D)    not  succeed,  because  he  is  entitled  to  recover  only  the

reasonable value of his services.

Answer  18:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Under  UCC  §  3-311,  a
creditor  who  cashes  a  partial-payment  check  offered  in  full
settlement  will  be  deemed  to  have  accepted  an  “accord  and

207

satisfaction,” and lose his right to sue for the balance, if: (1)
the  check  or  accompanying  communication  contained  a
“conspicuous  statement  to  the  effect  that  the  instrument  was
tendered as full satisfaction of the claim,” (2) the claim was
either “unliquidated” or was “subject to a bona fide dispute,”
and (3) the debtor acted in good faith. (This provision applies
even  to  contracts  for  services  rather  than  goods.)  All  3
requirements  imposed  by  §  3-311  are  met  here:  (1)  the
“payment  in  full”  legend  on  the  check  was  a  “conspicuous
statement” that the check was tendered in full payment; (2) the
prior letter shows that there was a dispute about whether the
painting was done correctly; and (3) there’s no indication that
Bell didn’t act in good faith.

(A)  is  not  the  best  response,  because  Ames’  cashing  of  the
check was an accord and satisfaction under UCC § 3-311, as
described  above.  Therefore,  Ames  can’t  recover  even  if  he
did paint the porch according to specs.

(B)  is  not  the  best  response,  because  (1)  it  ignores  the  fact
that  UCC  §  3-311  treats  the  cashing  of  the  check  as  an
agreement  to  settle;  and  (2)  “economic  duress”  is  not  a
defense or a relevant factor, at least where the duress does not
come from the other party to the contract.
(D)  is  not  the  best  answer,  because  it  states  an  irrelevant
factor.  If  Ames  had  not  cashed  the  check,  he  could  have
recovered the $2,000 (the remaining contract price) if he had
been able to show he had fulfilled the contract. But by cashing
the  partial-payment  check,  he  cut  off  his  right  to  sue  for  the
contract price. And that’s true no matter what the relationship
was between the contract price and the value of the services
rendered.  (If  you  chose  this  response,  you  may  have  been
thinking  of  quasi-contractual  recovery,  where  a  non-
substantially performing plaintiff’s damages are measured by
the reasonable value of his services. But this concept doesn’t
apply here, not only because of the check-cashing but because
there’s no indication that Ames indeed failed to substantially
perform, or if so, that the services were worth only $18,000.)

4.  Other settlements

Question  19:  A  lifeguard  saved  the  life  of  a  woman  who

208

thereafter  changed  her  will  to  leave  the  lifeguard  $1,000.
However,  upon  her  death  she  had  no  property  except  an
undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety
of  her  husband.  The  property  had  been  purchased  by  her
husband from an inheritance.

After  the  woman  died,  her  husband  signed  and  delivered  to
the  lifeguard  the  following  instrument:  “In  consideration  of
the  lifeguard’s  saving  my  wife’s  life  and  his  agreement  to
bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I hereby
promise  to  pay  the  lifeguard  $1,000.”  Upon  the  woman’s
husband’s  death,  the  lifeguard  filed  a  claim  for  $1,000.  The
husband’s executor contested the claim on the ground that the
instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration. On
which  of  the  following  theories  would  it  be  most  likely  that
the lifeguard could recover?

(A)  The husband and the lifeguard have made a compromise.
(B)  The husband must give restitution for benefits it would be

unjust to retain.

(or  a  substitute 

for  consideration, 

(C)  The husband is bound by promissory estoppel.
(D)  The husband executed a binding unilateral contract.
Answer  19:  Choice  (A)  is  correct,  because  it  provides  the
lifeguard’s  best  argument  for  recovery:  an  enforceable
contract.  A  valid  contract  requires  an  offer,  acceptance,  and
consideration 
like
promissory estoppel). Consideration is the sticky point here.
Consideration 
requires  a  bargained-for  exchange,  and
detriment to the promisee or benefit to the promisor. Here, as
to  the  promise  to  pay,  the  husband  is  the  promisor  and  the
lifeguard  is  the  promisee.  Courts  generally  hold  that  if  A
promises  not  to  sue  B  on  a  claim  (even  a  claim  that  is  of
questionable  validity),  in  exchange  for  B’s  promise  to  make
payment,  A’s  promise  not  to  sue  is  consideration  for  B’s
promise  to  pay.  Therefore,  the  court  will  probably  hold  that
the  lifeguard’s  release  of  his  claim  against  the  husband’s
estate  (whether  the  claim  would  have  proved  valid  or  not)
was  consideration  for 
the  husband’s  promise.  (Courts
disagree  about  what  happens  when  the  person  surrendering
the  claim  has  doubts  about  its  validity,  but  there’s  no
indication here that the lifeguard had doubts about the validity

209

of his potential claim against the husband’s estate, and in any
event the “compromise” theory is the only one of the choices
that could possibly allow the lifeguard to recover.)

Incidentally, note that the lifeguard’s saving the woman’s life
wouldn’t  be  consideration,  because  it  wasn’t  bargained  for;
he  saved  the  woman  before  his  agreement  with  the  husband
(or the woman, for that matter). If the husband’s promise were
solely  in  return  for  the  lifeguard’s  saving  the  woman’s  life,
then,  it  wouldn’t  be  enforceable.  It’s  the  compromise  that
makes it enforceable.

(B) is wrong, because the husband has not received any unjust
benefits  and,  even  if  he  had,  restitution  would  not  apply  to
these  facts.  Restitution  is  a  remedy  under  which  the  parties
are returned to their position before the contract was formed,
in  order  to  avoid  an  outcome  in  which  one  of  the  parties
receives unjust benefits. Restitution is measured by the value
rendered  to  defendant.  Here,  the  husband  hasn’t  benefitted
unjustly (at least in money terms) from the lifeguard’s saving
the wife’s life. In any case, the lifeguard has a valid claim at
law  (for  breach  of  contract,  since  his  agreement  with  the
husband was enforceable, as discussed in Choice (A) above),
so the equitable remedy of unjust enrichment (available only
if  a  legal  remedy  is  unavailable)  would  not  be  necessary  to
fix the problem.

(C)  is  wrong,  because  it  misstates  the  facts:  The  husband
would not be bound by promissory estoppel, because he’d be
bound by a valid contract. Promissory estoppel is a substitute
for consideration, used to avoid injustice. It is triggered by a
gratuitous  promise  that  is  likely  to,  and  does,  induce
detrimental  reliance  in  the  promisee.  The  first  reason
promissory  estoppel  doesn’t  apply  here  is  that  there’s  an
enforceable  contract,  and  the  court  will  award  the  plaintiff
promissory  estoppel  only  in  the  absence  of  an  enforceable
promise. The second reason is that there’s no indication that
the promisee (the lifeguard) relied in any substantial way on
the  promise  of  payment  (since  he  knew  that  he  could  still
bring  a  legal  claim  against  the  husband’s  estate,  for  the
reasons discussed in Choice (A) above).
(D)  is  wrong  because  it  mischaracterizes  the  facts:  The

210

contract was bilateral, not unilateral. An offer for a bilateral
contract seeks acceptance in the form of a promise; one for a
unilateral  contract  seeks  acceptance  by  performance.  Here,
the husband’s document says he was promising to pay $1,000
in return for the lifeguard’s return agreement (read: promise)
not  to  sue.  Thus,  since  the  husband  sought  and  received  an
(implicit) return promise, the resulting contract was bilateral.

III.  ILLUSORY, ALTERNATIVE AND IMPLIED

PROMISES

A.  Implied promises

Question 20:  A  buyer,  who  was  a  representative  of  a  bank,
contracted in writing with a shareholder, who owned all of a
corporation’s outstanding stock, to purchase all of her stock at
a  specified  price  per  share.  At  the  time  this  contract  was
executed,  the  buyer  said  to  the  shareholder,  “Of  course,  our
commitment to buy is conditioned on our obtaining approval
of  the  contract  from  the  bank’s  board  of  directors.”  The
shareholder replied, “Fine. No problem.”

The  board  orally  approved  the  contract,  but  the  shareholder
changed her mind and refused to consummate the sale on two
grounds:  (1)  when  the  agreement  was  made  there  was  no
consideration  for  her  promise  to  sell;  and  (2)  the  board’s
approval  of  the  contract  was  invalid.  If  the  buyer  sues  the
shareholder  for  breach  of  contract,  is  the  buyer  likely  to
prevail?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  buyer’s  promise  to  buy,  bargained  for
and  made  in  exchange  for  the  shareholder’s  promise  to
sell,  was  good  consideration  even  though  it  was
expressly conditioned on an event that was not certain to
occur.

(B)    Yes,  because  any  possible  lack  of  consideration  for  the
shareholder’s promise to sell was expressly waived by
the shareholder when the agreement was made.

(C)    No,  because  mutuality  of  obligation  between  the  parties

was lacking when the agreement was made.

(D)    No,  because  the  condition  of  the  board  of  director’s

211

approval  of  the  contract  was  an  essential  part  of  the
agreed exchange and was not in a signed writing.

Answer  20:  Choice  (A)  is  correct,  because  a  promise  to
perform an act is sufficient consideration to support a contract
even  if  the  duty  to  perform  that  act  is  made  expressly
conditional on the happening of another event. For a contract
to  be  binding,  each  party  must  give  bargained-for
consideration to the other. In the case of a bilateral contract,
such as the one in this problem, the consideration on each side
may take the form of a promise. Here, the buyer has promised
to pay for the shareholder’s stock, while the shareholder has
promised  to  sell  the  buyer  all  of  her  stock.  Although  the
buyer’s  promise  is  expressly  conditioned  on  receiving  the
board’s  approval,  an  event  that  is  not  certain  to  occur,  the
buyer’s  promise  is  still  adequate  as  consideration.  The
shareholder  may  argue  that  the  buyer  had  the  opportunity  to
avoid  the  contract  by  not  seeking  the  board’s  approval,
thus  not
rendering 
consideration  for  the  shareholder’s  return  promise  to  sell.
However,  the  express  language  of  a  condition  will  often  be
deemed  to  create  an  implied  promise  on  the  part  of  the
promisor  to  use  his  best  efforts  to  cause  the  condition  to
occur.  A  court  would  likely  hold  that  the  buyer  impliedly
promised  to  use  its  best  efforts  to  obtain  approval  of  the
contract,  making 
the
consideration  for  the  shareholder’s  return  promise  to  sell  if
board approval occurred.

consideration 
Consideration  may  consist  of  a  promise  to  either  take  any
affirmative  act  or  forbear  any  legal  right.  Here,  in  exchange
for the shareholder’s promise to sell, the buyer has implicitly
promised not only to buy if board approval occurred, but also
to  use  his  best  efforts  in  seeking  approval  of  the  contract,
making that implicit promise part of the consideration for the
shareholder’s  return  promise  to  sell  if  board  approval
occurred. As a result, this is a bilateral contract: one in which
the bargained-for exchange is one promise for another. Since
the buyer has provided consideration, there is no need for the

212

shareholder

lack  of

(C) is not the best response, because the parties entered into a
valid  bilateral  contract.  For  a  contract  to  be  binding,  each
party must give bargained-for consideration to the other. In the
case  of  a  bilateral  contract,  such  as  the  one  in  this  problem,
the  consideration  on  each  side  may  take  the  form  of  a
promise.  The  shareholder  may  argue  that  the  buyer  had  the
chance  to  avoid  the  contract  by  not  seeking  the  board’s
approval, rendering the buyer’s promise illusory and thus not
consideration  for  the  shareholder’s  return  promise  to  sell.
However,  the  express  language  of  a  condition  will  often
create an implied promise on the part of the promisor to use
his best efforts to cause the condition to occur. A court would
likely hold that the buyer impliedly promised to use his best
efforts  in  seeking  approval  of  the  contract,  making  that
implicit  promise  part  of 
the
shareholder’s  return  promise  to  sell  if  board  approval
occurred.  So  there  is  no  lack  of  mutuality  of  obligation — 
each  party  has  promised  to  do  something  in  return  for  the
other’s promise to do something.

the  consideration 

for 

(D) is not the best response, because there is no requirement
that an express condition be in a signed writing. Generally, a
signed  writing  will  only  be  required  if  the  contract  falls
within  the  Statute  of  Frauds.  However,  an  agreement  to
purchase  shares  of  stock  does  not  fall  within  the  Statute  of
Frauds,  so  there  is  no  requirement  that  any  part  of  this
contract  be  in  writing.  (Note  that  shares  of  stock  are  not
“goods”  within  the  meaning  of  Article  2  of  the  UCC  since
they  are  not  tangible  items.)  Since  the  contract  is  not  within
the Statute of Frauds, the fact that the condition requiring the
board’s  approval  is  not  included  within  the  signed  writing
will not cause the contract to fail.

IV.  REQUIREMENTS AND OUTPUT CONTRACTS

A.  Requirements and output contracts generally

1.  UCC approach

a.  How tested on the MBE

213

Question 21:  Responding  to  County’s  written  advertisement
for bids, Tyres was the successful bidder for the sale of tires
to  County  for  County’s  vehicles.  Tyres  and  County  entered
into  a  signed,  written  agreement  that  specified,  “It  is  agreed
that Tyres will deliver all tires required by this agreement to
County,  in  accordance  with  the  attached  bid  form  and
specifications, for a one-year period beginning September 1,
2005.” Attached to the agreement was a copy of the bid form
and  specifications.  In  the  written  advertisement  to  which
Tyres  had  responded,  but  not  in  the  bid  form,  County  had
stated, “Multiple awards may be issued if they are in the best
interests of County.” No definite quantity of tires to be bought
by  County  from  Tyres  was  specified  in  any  of  these
documents.

In January 2006, Tyres learned that County was buying some
of  its  tires  from  one  of  Tyres’s  competitors.  Contending  that
the  Tyres-County  agreement  was  a  requirements  contract,
Tyres sued County for the damages caused by County’s buying
some of its tires from the competitor.

If  the  court  concludes  that  the  Tyres-County  contract  is  an
agreement by County to buy its tire requirements from Tyres,
Tyres probably will

(A)    recover  under  the  Contracts  Clause  of  the  United  States

Constitution.

(B)  recover under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial

Code.

(C)    not  recover,  because  the  agreement  lacks  mutuality  of

obligation.

(D)    not  recover,  because  the  agreement  is  indefinite  as  to

quantity.

Answer 21: Choice (B) is correct. The UCC, in § 2-306(1),
makes  requirements  contracts  valid,  and  interprets  such
agreements  to  cover  “such  actual  .  .  .  requirements  as  may
occur  in  good  faith,  except  that  no  quantity  unreasonably
disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a
stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior .
.  .  requirements  may  be  .  .  .  demanded.”  Given  that  the
question tells you to assume that the Tyres-County contract is

214

interpreted to represent an obligation by County to buy all its
requirements  for  tires  from  Tyres,  the  contract  is  valid  as  a
requirements contract under § 2-306(1).

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  Contracts  Clause  of  the  U.S.
Constitution would not furnish the basis of recovery for Tyres.
The  Contracts  Clause  limits  the  circumstances  in  which  a
government may use its legislative powers to alter the terms
of contracts. But here, County is not trying to alter the terms of
its contract; it is merely hoping to persuade the court to find
the contract invalid under general contract principles. Such an
argument does not implicate the Contracts Clause.

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  agreement  does  have  mutuality  of
obligation — Tyres is required to supply all of the reasonable
requirements  of  County  for  tires  at  the  prices  stated  in  the
attachments, and in return County is obligated to purchase all
of  its  tires  exclusively  from  Tyres.  (If  the  agreement  were
interpreted  to  mean  merely  that  County  would  “order
whatever tires it decides to order” from Tyres, then the lack-
of-mutuality  argument  might  work;  but  you’re  told  that  the
contract is interpreted by the court to be a true requirements
contract.)
(D)  is  wrong  because  the  agreement  is  not  indefinite  as  to
quantity. It’s true that the contract does not specify a particular
number  of  tires,  but  a  contract  that  specifies  that  “all  of  the
buyer’s requirements” for a particular type of item are to be
purchased from the seller is deemed to be sufficiently definite
as to quantity.

b.  Good faith obligation

Question  22:  Under  a  written  agreement  a  manufacturer  of
pastries promised to sell its entire output of baked buns at a
specified  unit  price  to  a  bakery,  for  one  year.  The  bakery
promised not to sell any other supplier’s baked buns. Shortly
after  making  the  contract,  and  before  the  manufacturer  had
tendered  any  buns,  the  bakery  decided  that  the  contract  had
become undesirable because of a sudden, sharp decline in its
customers’  demand  for  baked  buns.  It  renounced 
the
agreement, and the manufacturer sues for breach of contract.
Which of the following will the court probably decide?

215

(A)    The  bakery  wins,  because  mutuality  of  obligation  was
lacking  in  that  the  bakery  made  no  express  promise  to
buy any of the manufacturer’s baked buns.

(B)    The  bakery  wins,  because  the  agreement  was  void  for
indefiniteness  of  quantity  and  total  price  for  the  year
involved.

(C)  The manufacturer wins, because the bakery’s promise to
sell at retail the manufacturer’s baked buns exclusively,
if it sold any such buns at all, implied a promise to use
its best efforts to sell bakery’s one-year output of baked
buns.

(D)  The manufacturer wins, because under the applicable law
both  parties  to  a  sale-of-goods  contract  impliedly
assume the risk of price and demand fluctuations.

Answer  22:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  This  was  an  output
contract, as well as a requirements contract. Under UCC § 2-
306(2), “A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer
for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes
unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best
efforts  to  supply  the  goods  and  by  the  buyer  to  use  best
efforts to promote their sale.” This was an exclusive-dealing
contract (all requirements and output contracts are exclusive-
dealing  contracts);  therefore,  since  the  parties  did  not
otherwise  agree,  §  2-306(2)  imposed  on  the  bakery  the
“obligation  .  .  .  to  use  best  efforts  to  promote  [the  goods’]
sale.”  When  the  bakery  renounced  the  agreement  without
having even bought any buns yet, it breached this best-efforts-
to-promote obligation.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  even  though  the  bakery  made  no
express promise to buy any of the manufacturer’s buns, under
§ 2-306(2), the bakery was implicitly obligated to make best
efforts  to  promote  the  sale  of  buns  so  that  the  bakery  would
need some of them.

(B)  is  wrong  because,  under  §  2-306(1),  “A  term  which
measures  the  quantity  by  the  output  of  the  seller  .  .  .  means
such  actual  output  .  .  .  as  may  occur  in  good  faith[.]”  This
section  has  the  effect  of  providing  a  quantity  (or  at  least,  a
method  for  determining  quantity),  saving  the  output  contract
here from indefiniteness.

216

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  does  not  speak  to  the  main  issue  in
the  case.  It’s  essentially  true  that  both  buyer  and  seller
“impliedly assume the risk of price and demand fluctuations,”
but  the  question  here  is  whether  buyer  could  rely  on  the
sudden reduction in its own customers’ demand to escape the
contract.  UCC  §  2-306(2)  in  effect  allocates  this  risk,  by
saying  that  the  buyer  in  both  a  requirements  and  output
contract  must  use  good  faith  to  promote  sale  of  the  goods,
effectively  negating  the  bakery’s  ability  to  discontinue  the
product line here without any promotional effort.

PROMISES BINDING WITHOUT
CONSIDERATION

I.    PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL

A.  Possible applications

1.  Promise to perform business service

a.  Promise to make a loan

Question 23:  Dominique  obtained  a  bid  of  $10,000  to  tear
down her old building and another bid of $90,000 to replace
it  with  a  new  structure  in  which  she  planned  to  operate  a
sporting  goods  store.  Having  only  limited  cash  available,
Dominique  asked  Hardcash  for  a  $100,000  loan.  After
reviewing  the  plans  for  the  project,  Hardcash  in  a  signed
writing  promised  to  lend  Dominique  $100,000  secured  by  a
mortgage  on  the  property  and  repayable  over  ten  years  in
equal monthly installments at 10% annual interest. Dominique
promptly  accepted  the  demolition  bid  and  the  old  building
was  removed,  but  Hardcash  thereafter  refused  to  make  the
loan.  Despite  diligent  efforts,  Dominique  was  unable  to
obtain a loan from any other source.

Does Dominique have a cause of action against Hardcash?

(A)    Yes,  because  by  having  the  building  demolished,  she

accepted Hardcash’s offer to make the loan.

(B)    Yes,  because  her  reliance  on  Hardcash’s  promise  was

substantial, reasonable, and foreseeable.

(C)    No,  because  there  was  no  bargained-for  exchange  of

consideration for Hardcash’s promise to make the loan.

(D)  No, because Dominique’s inability to obtain a loan from
any other source demonstrated that the project lacked the
financial soundness that was a constructive condition to
Hardcash’s performance.

Answer  23:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Hardcash  has  made  a
promise,  but  no  contract  has  come  into  existence.  (If
Hardcash’s  promise  is  viewed  as  an  offer,  it  was  never

218

accepted,  since  Dominique  never  actually  bound  herself  to
take  the  loan,  as  is  further  described  in  the  discussion  of
Choice  (A)  below.)  Therefore,  Dominique  will  have  to
recover on a promissory estoppel theory or not at all. Under
promissory estoppel, “A promise which the promisor should
reasonably  expect  to  induce  action  or  forbearance  on  the
part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce
such  action  or  forbearance  is  binding  if  injustice  can  be
avoided only by enforcement of the promise.” Rest. 2d, § 90.
Dominique  meets  all  of  the  requirements  for  promissory
estoppel:  (1)  Hardcash  made  a  promise  of  the  loan;  (2)
Hardcash  should  reasonably  have  expected  that  Dominique
would rely on the availability of the loan, by demolishing the
old structure (Hardcash knew that Dominique had gotten both
bids,  an  indication  of  the  likelihood  that  she  would  rely  by
doing  the  demolition);  (3)  Dominique  did  indeed  rely  by
demolishing, and reasonably so; and (4) at least some type of
enforcement  of  the  loan  promise  will  be  required  to  avoid
injustice, since otherwise Dominique will be left without the
use of the old building and with a loss of the funds used for
the demolition. (Notice that the phrase “promissory estoppel”
is not used in this choice — you have to notice that that’s the
basis for the choice, something that you’re clued in to from the
reference to “reliance.”)

(A)  is  wrong  because  Dominique’s  act  of  having  a  building
demolished  was  not  an  acceptance  of  the  offer.  It’s  not  so
clear that Hardcash’s promise was an “offer” at all, but even
if  it  was,  Hardcash  did  nothing  to  authorize  Dominique  to
“accept”  the  offer  by  demolishing  the  old  building — any
acceptance of a loan offer would, under these circumstances,
have  to  be  by  Dominique’s  taking  some  action  vis-à-vis
Hardcash  (e.g.,  signing  loan  papers  and  promising  to  repay
the loan, or at least paying some sort of commitment fee).
(C) 
the  absence  of  bargained-for
consideration  does  not  matter.  The  whole  point  of  the
promissory  estoppel  doctrine,  which  as  described  above
applies  here,  is  that  there  does  not  need  to  be  consideration
for the promise. In other words, promissory estoppel here is a
substitute for consideration.

is  wrong  because 

219

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  project’s  financial  soundness  was
not a constructive condition to Hardcash’s obligation to make
the  loan.  Hardcash  could  of  course  have  made  his  loan
promise  conditional  upon  Dominique’s  demonstration  to  his
satisfaction  that  the  project  was  financially  sound;  but  the
facts give no suggestion that Hardcash did this, and there is no
reason for the court to infer such a condition out of thin air.

220

CHAPTER 4
MISTAKE

I.    MUTUAL MISTAKE

A.  Three requirements for avoidance

1.  Allocation of risk by parties

Question  24:  A  breeder  bought  a  two-month-old  registered
boar at auction from a farmer for $800. No express warranty
was  made.  Fifteen  months  later,  tests  by  experts  proved
conclusively that the boar had been born incurably sterile. If
this  had  been  known  at  the  time  of  the  sale,  the  boar  would
have been worth no more than $100.

In  an  action  by  the  breeder  against  the  farmer  to  avoid  the
contract and recover the price paid, the parties stipulate that,
as both were and had been aware, the minimum age at which
the fertility of a boar can be determined is about 12 months.
Which of the following will the court probably decide?

(A)    The  breeder  wins,  because  the  parties  were  mutually
mistaken  as  to  the  boar’s  fertility  when  they  made  the
agreement.

(Q)    The  breeder  wins,  because  the  farmer  impliedly

warranted that the boar was fit for breeding.

(R)  The farmer wins, because the breeder assumed the risk of

the boar’s sterility.

(S)    The  farmer  wins,  because  any  mistake  involved  was

unilateral, not mutual.

Answer 24: The correct choice is (C). Since the facts tell us
that  the  farmer  made  no  express  warranty,  the  only  way  the
breeder  can  avoid  the  contract  is  if  he  successfully  invokes
the  doctrine  of  mutual  mistake.  The  UCC  is  silent  on  the
subject of mistake, so the matter is left to the common law. A
good summary of the common law on mutual mistake is given
by the Second Restatement: “Where a mistake of both parties
at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on
which  the  contract  was  made  has  a  material  effect  on  the
agreed exchange of performances, the contract is voidable by

221

the  adversely  affected  party  unless  he  bears  the  risk  of  the
mistake[.]” Rest. 2d §152(1). Even if the fertility of the boar
was  a  “basic  assumption”  on  which  the  contract  was  made
(which  it  probably  wasn’t,  since  both  parties  knew  that
fertility couldn’t yet be determined), the breeder will lose if
the court concludes that he “bore the risk of the mistake.” The
facts  tell  us  that  both  parties  knew  that  the  boar’s  fertility
could not yet be known at the time of the sale. Therefore, the
breeder  was  consciously  aware  of  his  ignorance  about  the
boar’s fertility, and a party who is consciously aware of his
ignorance  of  fact  X  will  be  found  to  bear  the  burden  of  fact
X’s  turning  out  to  be  true  and  damaging.  Therefore,  the
breeder will be found to bear the risk of the boar’s turning out
to be sterile.

(A) is wrong, because the doctrine of mutual mistake will not
apply  on  these  facts.  As  is  described  more  fully  in  the
discussion of Choice (C), a party cannot invoke the doctrine
of mutual mistake if he is found to have borne the risk of the
type  of  mistake  in  question.  A  party  who  proceeds  with
conscious ignorance of whether a particular “bad” fact is true
will  be  found  to  have  borne  the  risk  of  that  fact.  Since  the
breeder  knew  that  he  didn’t  (and  indeed  couldn’t)  know  the
boar’s fertility status at the time of sale, he’ll be found to have
borne  the  risk  of  infertility,  making  the  mutual  mistake
doctrine inapplicable.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  no  implied  warranty  was  made.  A
seller is deemed to make an implied warranty of fitness for a
particular purpose only where the buyer relies on the seller’s
“skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods.” UCC §
2-315. Since both parties knew that fertility could not yet be
known,  and  since  there  is  no  indication  that  the  farmer  said
anything to indicate to the breeder that the farmer believed the
boar would likely be good for breeding, there is no evidence
of  the  breeder’s  reliance  on  the  farmer’s  selection  skills.
Therefore,  the  farmer  did  not  make  an  implied  warranty  of
fitness for breeding.
(D) is not the best response, because no “mistake” was made
(whether unilateral or mutual), and because even the existence
of a unilateral mistake here would not support recovery. The

222

same  requirements  are  imposed  for  unilateral  mistake  as  for
mutual  mistake  (see  the  discussion  of  Choice  (C)  above  for
the latter), but in addition, either of two things must be shown:
(1)  that  the  mistake  is  such  that  enforcement  of  the  contract
would  be  unconscionable,  or  (2)  that  the  other  party  had
reason to know of the mistake or his fault caused the mistake.
The  breeder  could  not  prove  a  mutual  mistake  was  made,
because, as described in the discussion of Choice (C) above,
the  breeder  knew  that  he  didn’t  know  anything  about  the
boar’s  fertility,  and  thus  bore  the  risk  of  any  mistake.
Furthermore,  the  breeder  cannot  show  either  of  the  two
additional  elements  needed  to  prove  unilateral  mistake:  (1)
the  deal  was  not  unconscionable,  since  unconscionability  is
very rare in commercial settings, and since the price here was
implicitly set by market conditions, and factored in the risk of
infertility; and (2) the farmer did not have reason to know of
the  mistake — it  was  impossible  for  either  party  to  have
known the fertility of a two-month-old boar.

II.    REFORMATION AS REMEDY FOR ERROR

IN EXPRESSION

A.  Generally

1.  Not a remedy for underlying disagreement about deal

Question 25: A landowner and a prospective buyer, standing
on a parcel owned by the landowner, orally agreed to its sale
and  purchase  for  $5,000,  and  orally  marked  its  bounds  as
“that  line  of  trees  down  there,  the  ditch  that  intersects  them,
the fence on the other side, and that street on the fourth side.”
In  which  of  the  following  is  the  remedy  of  reformation  most
appropriate?
(A)    As  later  reduced  to  writing,  the  agreement  by  clerical
mistake included two acres that are actually beyond the
fence.

(B)    The  buyer  reasonably  thought  that  two  acres  beyond  the
fence  were  included  in  the  oral  agreement  but  the
landowner  did  not.  As  later  reduced  to  writing,  the
agreement included the two acres.

223

(C)  The buyer reasonably thought that the price orally agreed
upon  was  $4,500,  but  the  landowner  did  not.  As  later
reduced to writing, the agreement said $5,000.

(D)    The  buyer  reasonably  thought  that  a  dilapidated  shed
backed  up  against  the  fence  was  to  be  torn  down  and
removed as part of the agreement, but the landowner did
not.  As  later  reduced  to  writing,  the  agreement  said
nothing about the shed.

Answer 25: Choice (A) is correct. If the parties orally agree
on  a  deal,  but  mistakenly  prepare  and  execute  a  document
which  incorrectly  reflects  that  oral  agreement,  either  party
may obtain a court order for reformation (i.e., a re-writing of
the document). That’s what would happen in this choice, since
both parties agreed on what acreage was to be covered by the
agreement,  and  a  clerical  mistake  caused  the  document  to
diverge from the oral agreement.

Choices (B), (C), and (D) are all wrong for the same reason:
Tthe parties did not in fact have a meeting of the minds about
a  key 
their  “actual”
(subjective)  agreement  is  not  possible.  In  this  situation,
discharge  for  mutual  mistake,  rather  than  reformation,  is  the
appropriate remedy.

PAROL EVIDENCE AND
INTERPRETATION

I.    TOTAL AND PARTIAL INTEGRATIONS

A.  Statement of rule

1.  Summary

Question  26:  Stirrup,  a  rancher,  and  Equinox,  a  fancier  of
horses,  signed  the  following  writing:  “For  $55,000,  Stirrup
will  sell  to  Equinox  a  gray  horse  that  Equinox  may  choose
from among the grays on Stirrup’s ranch.”

Equinox  refused  to  accept  delivery  of  a  gray  horse  timely
tendered  by  Stirrup  or  to  choose  among  those  remaining,  on
the  ground  that  during  their  negotiations  Stirrup  had  orally
agreed  to  include  a  saddle,  worth  $100,  and  also  to  give
Equinox  the  option  to  choose  a  gray  or  a  brown  horse.
Equinox insisted on one of Stirrup’s brown horses, but Stirrup
refused to part with any of his browns or with the saddle as
demanded by Equinox.

If  Equinox  sues  Stirrup  for  damages  and  seeks  to  introduce
evidence  of  the  alleged  oral  agreement,  the  court  probably
will

(A)  admit the evidence as to both the saddle and the option to

choose a brown horse.

(B)  admit the evidence as to the saddle but not the option to

choose a brown horse.

(C)    admit  the  evidence  as  to  the  option  to  choose  a  brown

horse but not the promise to include the saddle.

(D)  not admit any of the evidence.
Answer 26: Choice (B) is correct. The key to this question is
to correctly categorize the writing: Is it a complete integration
or a partial one? In deciding such a question, courts give a lot
of  weight  to  the  nature  of  the  document  itself:  The  more
extensive  and  formal,  the  more  likely  it  is  to  have  been
intended  to  be  a  complete  integration.  Here,  the  fact  that  the

225

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

writing  consists  of  just  one  very  informal  sentence  strongly
suggests  that  it  was  intended  as  only  a  partial  integration;
since  there  is  no  evidence  pointing  in  the  other  direction,  a
court  would  almost  certainly  conclude  that  the  writing  was
only a partial integration. Therefore, it can be supplemented,
but  cannot  be  contradicted,  by  a  prior  or  simultaneous  oral
understanding.  The  alleged  saddle  agreement  merely
supplements the writing, since the writing doesn’t purport to
cover  the  issue  of  accessories;  therefore,  evidence  of  the
saddle  agreement  will  be  admissible.  The  oral  agreement  to
choose a brown horse, on the other hand, is directly at odds
with  the  writing,  since  the  writing  specifies  that  Equinox  is
permitted  to  choose  from  among  gray  horses,  and  does  not
mention any right to choose a brown horse; therefore, the oral
agreement  on  brown  horses  will  be  excluded  as  a
contradiction  even  though  the  writing  is  only  a  partial
integration.

Choices  (A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  they  are
inconsistent with the above analysis.

II.   SITUATIONS WHERE PAROL EVIDENCE

RULE DOES NOT APPLY

A.  Existence of a condition on effectiveness of contract

1.  Often tested on MBE

Question  27:  Buyer,  Inc.,  contracted 
in  writing  with
Shareholder,  who  owned  all  of  XYZ  Corporation’s
outstanding  stock,  to  purchase  all  of  her  stock  at  a  specified
price  per  share.  At  the  time  this  contract  was  executed,
Buyer’s  contracting  officer  said  to  Shareholder,  “Of  course,
our  commitment  to  buy  is  conditioned  on  our  obtaining
approval of the contract from Conglomerate, Ltd., our parent
company.” Shareholder replied, “Fine. No problem.”
Later, Shareholder was willing and ready to consummate the
sale of her stock to Buyer, but the latter refused to perform on
the  ground  (which  was  true)  that  Conglomerate  had  firmly
refused to approve the contract. If Shareholder sues Buyer for
breach  of  contract  and  seeks  to  exclude  any  evidence  of  the

226

oral  condition  requiring  Conglomerate’s  approval,  the  court
will probably

(A)  admit the evidence as proof of a collateral agreement.
(B)    admit  the  evidence  as  proof  of  a  condition  to  the
existence of an enforceable obligation, and therefore not
within the scope of the parol evidence rule.

(C)    exclude  the  evidence  on  the  basis  of  a  finding  that  the
parties’ written agreement was a complete integration of
their contract.

(D)    exclude  the  evidence  as  contradicting  the  terms  of  the
parties’  written  agreement,  whether  or  not  the  writing
was a complete integration of the contract.

Answer  27:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  When  the  parties  to  a
written  contract  agree  orally  that  the  enforceability  of  the
contract is subject to a condition, proof of the existence of that
condition does not fall within the parol evidence rule.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  although  there  is  indeed  a  “collateral
agreement” exception to the parol evidence rule (an exception
discussed immediately below in the main text), that exception
is  not  applicable  here.  The  collateral  agreement  exception
allows proof of an oral “side” agreement in which the parties
agreed  to  a  separate  exchange,  as  long  as  the  alleged  side
agreement is not inconsistent with the total integration. But the
“approval  required”  condition  here  was  not  a  collateral
agreement;  rather,  it  was  a  condition  to  the  enforceability  of
the  main  agreement,  so  the  collateral-agreement  exception
does not apply.

(C)  is  wrong  because,  even  though  the  parties’  written
agreement here was probably a complete integration of their
contract,  proof  of  an  oral  condition  to  the  contract’s
enforceability  is  nonetheless  allowed,  as  described  in  the
discussion of Choice (B).
(D) is wrong because, although this formulation is essentially
a  correct  statement  of  the  parol  evidence  rule  on  provisions
that contradict the writing (under which even a partial rather
than complete integration may not be contradicted by a prior
or  simultaneous  oral  understanding),  the  rule  does  not  apply
to a condition to the enforceability of the contract.

227

Question 28: A landowner and a landscape architect signed a
detailed  writing  in  which  the  landscape  architect  agreed  to
landscape and replant the landowner’s residential property in
accordance  with  a  design  prepared  by  the  architect  and
incorporated  in  the  writing.  The  landowner  agreed  to  pay
$10,000  for  the  work  upon  its  completion.  The  landowner’s
spouse  was  not  a  party  to  the  agreement,  and  had  no
ownership interest in the premises.

Shortly before the agreement was signed, the landowner and
the architect orally agreed that the writing would not become
binding on either party unless the landowner’s spouse should
approve  the  landscaping  design.  If  the  landowner’s  spouse
disapproves  the  design  and  the  landowner  refuses  to  allow
the architect to proceed with the work, is evidence of the oral
agreement  admissible  in  the  architect’s  action  against  the
landowner for breach of contract?

(A)  Yes, because the oral agreement required approval by a

third party.

(B)    Yes,  because  the  evidence  shows  that  the  writing  was
intended to take effect only if the approval occurred.
(C)    No,  because  the  parol  evidence  rule  bars  evidence  of  a
prior oral agreement even if the latter is consistent with
the terms of a partial integration.

(D)    No,  because  the  prior  oral  agreement  contradicted  the

writing by making the parties’ duties conditional.

Answer  28:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Ordinarily,  the  parol
evidence  rule  bars  proof  of  an  oral  clause  offered  to
supplement  or  contradict  a  completely  integrated  writing
(which the writing here probably was). But an oral agreement
that the writing will simply not be legally enforceable at all
unless some condition precedent is satisfied is not barred by
the  parol  evidence  rule.  This  exception  applies  here:  The
owner’s  spouse’s  approval  of  the  design  was  a  condition
precedent to the enforceability of the agreement, so that oral
condition, and its non- satisfaction, may be proved.
(A)  is  wrong  because  it  gives  an  incorrect  reason  for  the
correct  result.  It  is  not  the  fact  that  a  third  party’s  approval
was  required  that  makes  evidence  of  the  oral  agreement

228

admissible in the face of the parol evidence rule; it’s the fact
that  the  oral  agreement  established  a  condition  precedent  to
the  writing’s  enforceability  that  exempts  proof  of  the  oral
agreement from the rule.

(C)  is  wrong  for  two  reasons:  (1)  it  misstates  the  “partial
integration”  branch  of  the  parol  evidence  rule  (under  which
an  oral  agreement  that  supplements  rather  than  contradicts  a
partial integration is admissible); and (2) the parol evidence
rule simply doesn’t apply to an orally-agreed-upon condition
to  the  writing’s  enforceability,  as  analyzed  in  Choice  (B)
above.

the  parol  evidence 

(D)  is  wrong  because,  while  it  correctly  summarizes  the
branch  of 
that  bars  oral
understandings  that  contradict  any  sort  of  integration  (partial
or complete), it fails to reflect the fact that the parol evidence
rules simply doesn’t apply to an orally-agreed-upon condition
to  the  writing’s  enforceability,  as  analyzed  in  Choice  (B)
above.

rule 

III.  INTERPRETATION

A.  Modern view

1.  Extrinsic evidence in the case of ambiguous terms

a.  Evidence of parties’ own pre-contract negotiations

Question 29:  Responding  to  County’s  written  advertisement
for bids, Tyres was the successful bidder for the sale of tires
to  County  for  County’s  vehicles.  Tyres  and  County  entered
into  a  signed,  written  agreement  that  specified,  “It  is  agreed
that Tyres will deliver all tires required by this agreement to
County,  in  accordance  with  the  attached  bid  form  and
specifications, for a one-year period beginning September 1,
2005.” Attached to the agreement was a copy of the bid form
and  specifications.  In  the  written  advertisement  to  which
Tyres  had  responded,  but  not  in  the  bid  form,  County  had
stated, “Multiple awards may be issued if they are in the best
interests of County.” No definite quantity of tires to be bought
by  County  from  Tyres  was  specified  in  any  of  these
documents.

229

In January 2006, Tyres learned that County was buying some
of  its  tires  from  one  of  Tyres’s  competitors.  Contending  that
the  Tyres-County  agreement  was  a  requirements  contract,
Tyres sued County for the damages caused by County’s buying
some of its tires from the competitor.

If  County  defends  by  offering  proof  of  the  advertisement
concerning  the  possibility  of  multiple  awards,  should  the
court admit the evidence?

(A)  Yes, because the provision in the written agreement, “all

tires required by this agreement,” is ambiguous.

to 

(B)  Yes, because the advertisement was in writing.
(C)  No, because of the parol evidence rule.
(D)  No, because it would make the contract illusory.
Answer 29: Choice (A) is correct. All courts agree that if a
term is found by the trial court to be ambiguous — capable of
more than one meaning — extrinsic evidence on the meaning
term  must  be  allowed,
the 
the  parties  attached 
notwithstanding the parol evidence rule. The phrase “all tires
required  by  this  agreement”  is  indeed  ambiguous,  as  this
choice  suggests:  A  reader  looking  only  at  the  contract
document  itself  (including  the  attachments)  would  not  know
whether the phrase meant merely “whatever quantities of tires
that  County  decides  to  order  during  the  contract  term”  or
instead the far meatier “all County’s tire requirements during
the  contract  term.”  Since  the  advertisement  was  effectively
part of the parties’ negotiations — it disclosed to Tyres what
County was thinking at the outset — it fairly bears on what the
parties intended by the ambiguous phrase.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  the  advertisement  was  in
writing is irrelevant. This choice incorrectly implies that the
only materials barred by the parol evidence rule are prior or
simultaneous  oral  understandings  between  the  parties.  Prior
writings agreed to or exchanged between the parties are also
excluded  by  the  parol  evidence  rule,  if  offered  to  add  terms
to, or contradict terms in, a final writing.
(C)  is  wrong  because  of  the  “ambiguity”  exception  to  the
parol  evidence  rule,  described  in  the  discussion  of  Choice
(A) above.

230

to  put 

in  proof  of 

the  advertisement, 

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  makes  a  conclusion  that  does  not
logically  follow  from  its  premise.  It  is  true  that  if  County  is
permitted 
the
consequence  will  likely  be  that  the  contract  would  be  held
illusory  (since  County  would  be  promising  only  to  “buy
whatever we decide to buy”), and County’s illusory promise
would not furnish consideration for Tyres’ return promise. But
the fact that an item of proffered evidence would, if admitted,
tend to prove that a contract is unenforceable does not mean
that the parol evidence rule requires exclusion of that piece of
evidence.

IV.  TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF

PERFORMANCE, AND COURSE OF DEALING

A.  Used to interpret even a complete integration

Question  30:  A  radio  manufacturer  and  a  retailer,  after
extensive negotiations, entered into a final, written agreement
in  which  the  manufacturer  agreed  to  sell  and  the  retailer
agreed  to  buy  all  of  the  retailer’s  requirements  of  radios,
estimated at 20 units per month, during the period January 1,
2004, and December 31, 2006, at a price of $50 per unit. A
dispute  arose  in  late  December  2006,  when  the  retailer
returned  25  non-defective  radios  to  the  manufacturer  for  full
credit after the manufacturer had refused to extend the contract
for a second three-year period.

In  an  action  by  the  manufacturer  against  the  retailer  for
damages  due  to  the  return  of  the  25  radios,  the  manufacturer
introduces  the  written  agreement,  which  expressly  permitted
the  buyer  to  return  defective  radios  for  credit  but  was  silent
as to the return of non-defective radios for credit. The retailer
seeks to introduce evidence that during the three years of the
agreement  it  had  returned,  for  various  reasons,  125  non-
defective radios, for which the manufacturer had granted full
credit.  The  manufacturer  objects  to  the  admissibility  of  this
evidence.
The trial court will probably rule that the evidence proffered
by the retailer is

231

(A)  inadmissible, because the evidence is barred by the parol

evidence rule.

(B)  inadmissible, because the express terms of the agreement
control when those terms are inconsistent with the course
of performance.

(C)  admissible, because the evidence supports an agreement

that is not within the relevant statute of frauds.

(D)    admissible,  because  course-of-performance  evidence,
when available, is considered the best indication of what
the parties intended the writing to mean.

Answer 30: Choice (D) is correct. Even where the writing is
a  complete  integration,  as  it  is  here,  the  court  will  look  to
course-of-performance evidence to determine what the parties
meant as to a point on which the writing is ambiguous. This is
true  in  both  sales  and  non-sales  cases.  Thus,  in  sales
governed by UCC Article 2, § 2-208(1) says that “Where the
contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance
by  either  party  with  knowledge  of  the  nature  of  the
performance  and  opportunity  for  objection  to  it  by  the  other,
any  course  of  performance  accepted  or  acquiesced  in
without  objection  shall  be  relevant  to  determine  the
meaning  of  the  agreement.”  Here,  the  evidence  proffered  by
the  retailer — that  the  manufacturer  permitted  him  to  return
undamaged  radios  for  credit  earlier  during  the  course  of  the
present  contract — fits  §  2-208(1)  exactly,  since  the  retailer
is  claiming  that  the  manufacturer’s  knowing  acquiescence  in
the retailer’s repeated requests for a credit for non-defective
returned  goods  was  a  course  of  performance,  admissible  to
show  that  the  parties  intended  the  writing  to  mean  that  such
returns are allowed.
(A)  is  wrong  because,  as  further  explained  in  Choice  (D)
above, even though the writing here is a complete integration,
the  proffered  evidence  is  course-of-performance  evidence,
which  is  admissible  notwithstanding  the  parol  evidence  rule
to show the meaning of the agreement.
(B) is wrong because it states an irrelevant point. It’s true that
the express terms control if those terms are inconsistent with
the  course  of  performance;  thus  UCC  §  2-208(2)  says  that
“The  express  terms  of  an  agreement  and  any  .  .  .  course  of

232

performance,  as  well  as  any  course  of  dealing  and  usage  of
trade,  shall  be  construed  wherever  reasonable  as  consistent
with each other; but when such construction is unreasonable,
express  terms  shall  control  course  of  performance  and
course  of  performance  shall  control  both  course  of  dealing
and  usage  of  trade[.]”  But  here,  there  is  no  express  term
dealing with the retailer’s right to return non-defective goods
for credit (the writing is silent on this point), so the priority of
express terms over the course of performance simply doesn’t
apply.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  relies  on  an  irrelevant  fact.  The
retailer  is  not  trying  to  show  an  “agreement”  to  modify  the
original agreement — if he were, then there might be a Statute
of Frauds issue. Instead, he’s trying to show what the original
the  use  of  course-of-
written  agreement  meant 
performance evidence), and his ability to do that has nothing
to do with the Statute of Frauds.

CONDITIONS, BREACH, AND OTHER
ASPECTS OF PERFORMANCE

I.    EXPRESS CONDITIONS

A.  Satisfaction of a party

1.  Subjective

Question  31:  A  photographer  and  a  customer  entered  a
contract in writing on November 1, the essential part of which
read  as  follows:  “The  photographer  to  supply  the  customer
with  200  personalized  Christmas  cards  on  or  before
December 15, 2010, bearing a photograph of the customer and
his family, and the customer to pay $100 thirty days thereafter.
Photograph to be taken by the photographer at the customer’s
house. Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time.”
Because  the  customer  suddenly  became  ill,  the  photographer
was unable to take the necessary photograph of the customer
and  his  family  until  the  first  week  of  December.  The  final
week’s  delay  was  caused  by  the  photographer’s  not  being
notified  promptly  by  the  customer  of  his  recovery.  Before
taking  the  photograph  of  the  customer  and  his  family,  the
photographer  advised  the  customer  that  he  was  likely  to  be
delayed  a  day  or  two  beyond  December  15  in  making
delivery  because  of  the  time  required  to  process  the
photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to
take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered
by  the  photographer  to  the  customer  on  December  17,  the
photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim.
Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, the customer
refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of
the  cards  at  arm’s  length  without  bothering  to  put  on  his
reading  glasses,  “The  photograph  makes  me  look  too  old.
Besides, the cards weren’t delivered on time.”
In an action by the photographer against the customer, which
of the following would be the customer’s best defense?

(A)  The cards, objectively viewed, were not satisfactory.

234

(T)  The cards, subjectively viewed, were not satisfactory.
(U)  The cards were not delivered on time.
(V)    The  customer’s  illness  excused  him  from  further

obligation under the contract.

Answer  31:  The  correct  choice  is  (B),  because 
the
customer’s dissatisfaction, if in good faith, would relieve him
of  performing  under  the  contract,  and  would  thus  be  a  good
defense.  Whether  satisfaction  is  objective  or  subjective
depends on the subject matter of the contract. In a construction
or  manufacturing  contract,  a  satisfaction  clause  will  require
the  satisfaction  of  a  reasonable  person.  But  if  personal  taste
or judgment is involved (e.g., cosmetic surgery, paintings, and
the like), only subjective satisfaction is required. Here, since
a  portrait  photograph  is  involved,  the  customer’s  personal,
subjective  satisfaction  is  all  that’s  required;  as  long  as  he
operates  in  good  faith,  he  can  reject  performance  and  avoid
liability  under  the  contract,  even  if  the  photograph  is
objectively  satisfactory.  As  choice  B  points  out,  this  would,
as a result, be a good defense for the customer.
(A)  is  wrong  because  arguing  that  the  cards  are  objectively
unsatisfactory  wouldn’t  help  the  customer,  for  two  reasons.
First,  as  is  described  in  Choice  (B),  if  personal  taste  or
judgment is involved, only subjective satisfaction is required.
Second,  the  facts  tell  you  that  the  rest  of  the  family  was
pleased;  it  was  only  the  customer  who  was  displeased.  So
even if the standard were  objective  satisfaction,  the  fact  that
the family was satisfied would tend to rebut the argument that
the cards are objectively unsatisfactory.

(C) is wrong, because the customer waived the condition that
the  cards  be  delivered  on  time,  so  arguing  that  he  should  be
excused  from  performance  due  to  the  delay  would  not  help
him.
Under the contract, time was probably made “of the essence”
by  expressly  providing  that  the  cards  must  be  delivered  “on
time.”  Even  if  the  contract  hadn’t  specifically  provided  for
delivery on time, the fact that the cards were Christmas cards,
and Christmas was fast approaching, suggests that time was of
the  essence.  As  a  result,  under  normal  circumstances,  any
delay  would  be  considered  a  major  breach,  relieving  the

235

customer of the duty to perform under the contract. However,
conditions  can  be  excused  by  waiver,  and  that’s  what
happened here. When the photographer told the customer that
the  customer’s  inability  to  have  his  picture  taken  earlier
would  mean  a  delay  in  the  completion  date,  by  telling  the
photographer  to  go  ahead  and  take  the  picture  anyway,  the
customer  was  waiving  delivery  on  December  15th,  and
thereby  excusing  the  delivery-on-time  express  condition.
Thereafter,  the  customer  could  not  rely  on  breach  of  the
condition as a defense.

(Even if the customer had not expressly waived the condition,
his  subsequent  failure  to  notify  the  photographer  of  his
recovery would excuse the delivery-on-time condition, since,
had the customer notified the photographer immediately of his
recovery,  the  photographer  could  have  performed  on  time.
Thus  the  customer’s  own  wrongful  conduct  prevented  the
condition  from  occurring,  blocking  him  from  avoiding
liability by relying on failure of the condition.)

(D) is wrong, because the customer’s illness wouldn’t excuse
him  from  performing  under  the  contract.  If  the  customer’s
illness had prevented him from performing under the contract,
then he would have a valid impossibility defense, and would
avoid liability under the contract. But that’s not what the facts
here  tell  you.  The  photographer’s  final  delivery  of  the
pictures was only two days late, and the customer’s delay in
giving notice of his recovery lasted one week. Thus, it’s not
the customer’s illness that caused the delay, but his failure to
promptly  notify  the  photographer  of  his  recovery.  Therefore,
as  described  in  (C),  the  customer’s  failure  to  call  the
photographer in a timely way acted as a waiver of the on-time
condition.

Question  32:  In  a  writing  signed  by  both  parties  on
December  1,  a  buyer  agreed  to  buy  from  a  seller  a  gasoline
engine  for  $1,000,  delivery  to  be  made  on  the  following
February 1. Through a secretarial error, the writing called for

236

delivery on March 1, but neither party noticed the error until
February 1. Before signing the agreement, the buyer and seller
orally agreed that the contract of sale would be effective only
if  the  buyer  should  notify  the  seller  in  writing  not  later  than
January 2 that the buyer had arranged to resell the engine to a
third  person.  Otherwise,  they  agreed  orally,  “There  is  no
deal.” On December 15, the buyer entered into a contract with
a  third  person  to  resell  the  engine  to  the  third  person  at  a
profit.

On December 16, the buyer notified the seller by telephone of
the  buyer’s  resale  agreement  with  the  third  person,  and
explained  that  a  written  notice  was  unfeasible  because  the
buyer’s  secretary  was  ill.  The  seller  replied,  “That’s  okay.
I’ll  get  the  engine  to  you  on  February  1,  as  we  agreed.”
Having  learned,  however,  that  the  engine  had  increased  in
value about 75% since December 1, the seller renounced the
agreement on February 1.

If  the  buyer  sues  the  seller  on  February  2  for  breach  of
contract,  which  of  the  following  concepts  best  supports  the
buyer’s claim?
(A)  Substantial performance.
(B)  Nonoccurrence of a condition subsequent.
(C)  Waiver of condition.
(D)  Novation of buyers.
Answer  32:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  It  was  a  condition
precedent  to  the  enforceability  of  the  contract  that  the  buyer
give  written  notice  to  the  seller  by  Jan.  2  that  the  buyer  had
found  a  buyer.  However,  when  the  buyer  explained  the
difficulty  with  a  written  notice  to  the  seller  on  Dec.  16,  the
seller’s “That’s okay” response clearly indicated to the buyer
that the seller would not insist on the written notice. This oral
response constituted a waiver of the condition, i.e., a knowing
intent to abandon the benefit of the condition.
(A) is wrong because the requirement of a writing by Jan. 2
was an express condition to the enforceability of the contract.
Complete,  not  just  substantial,  compliance  with  an  express
condition is normally required. Since the oral notice did not
completely  comply  with  the  requirement  of  a  written  notice,

237

the  fact  that  it  may  have  constituted  substantial  performance
will not help the buyer.

(B) is wrong because: (1) the condition here was a condition
precedent  (the  condition  had  to  be  satisfied  before  the
contract  would  ever  become  enforceable),  not  a  condition
subsequent  (i.e.,  something  that  if  not  satisfied  would
“unenforce”  the  previously  enforceable  contract);  and  (2)
even in the unlikely event that the condition was found to be a
condition  subsequent,  its  nonoccurrence  could  only  help  the
seller, not the buyer.

(D) is wrong because the concept of a novation has nothing to
do with these facts. A novation occurs when the two original
parties  to  a  contract — an  obligor  and  an  obligee — agree
that a stranger can be substituted for the original obligor. So,
for  instance,  if  the  seller  and  the  buyer  agreed  that  the  third
person  would  substitute  for  the  buyer  as  the  party  who  was
under  contract  to  buy  the  engine  from  the  seller,  a  novation
would  have  occurred.  But  on  the  actual  facts  here,  no
substitution of either of the original parties to the contract has
occurred, so there is no novation.

b.  Waiver by receiving and keeping benefit

i.  MBE tip

Question 33: Ohner and Planner signed a detailed writing in
which Planner, a landscape architect, agreed to landscape and
replant  Ohner’s  residential  property  in  accordance  with  a
design  prepared  by  Planner  and  incorporated  in  the  writing.
Ohner  agreed  to  pay  $50,000  for  the  work  upon  its
completion.

At  Ohner’s  insistence,  the  written  Ohner-Planner  agreement
contained  a  provision  that  neither  party  would  be  bound
unless  Ohner’s  law  partner,  an  avid  student  of  landscaping,
should approve Planner’s design. Before Planner commenced
the work, Ohner’s law partner, in the presence of both Ohner
and  Planner,  expressly  disapproved  the  landscaping  design.
Nevertheless,  Ohner  ordered  Planner  to  proceed  with  the
work,  and  Planner  reluctantly  did  so.  When  Planner’s
performance was 40% complete, Ohner repudiated his duty, if
any, to pay the contract price or any part thereof.

238

If Planner now sues Ohner for damages for breach of contract,
which  of  the  following  concepts  best  supports  Planner’s
claim?

(A)  Substantial performance.
(B)  Promissory estoppel.
(C)  Irrevocable waiver of condition.
(D)  Unjust enrichment.
Answer 33:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  When  the  circumstances
indicate that a condition is intended for the protection of just
one  party,  that  party  is  always  free  to  waive  the  condition.
Such  a  waiver  can  occur  by  implication.  That’s  what
happened here: the “partner must approve” provision was an
express condition intended for the benefit of Ohner, and Ohner
had  the  power  to  waive  it,  expressly  or  implicitly.  When
Ohner  ordered  Planner  to  proceed  notwithstanding  the
partner’s  disapproval,  this  was  an  implied  waiver  of  the
condition. At the moment the waiver occurred, Ohner had the
power  to  retract  it  (i.e.,  reinstate  the  condition).  But  once
Planner  began  the  work,  this  was  a  material  change  in
position  by  Planner  in  reliance  on  the  waiver,  and  that
reliance made the waiver non-retractable, i.e., irrevocable.

(A)  is  wrong  because:  (1)  the  doctrine  of  substantial
performance  helps  a  plaintiff  recover  “on  the  contract,”  and
here there would be no contract if the non-occurrence of the
partner-approval condition is not somehow excused (which it
is by operation of the doctrine of waiver, as described in the
analysis of Choice (C) above); and (2) Planner has done only
40%  of  the  work,  and  such  a  small  portion  would  not  be
considered “substantial performance.”

(B) is wrong because the promissory estoppel doctrine, even
where  it  applies,  makes  the  promise  enforceable  only  to  the
extent  “necessary  to  avoid  injustice,”  and  here,  injustice
could be avoided by awarding Planner just the value of 40%
partial  performance  (a  reliance  or  restitution  measure).
Planner is suing for breach of the contract, and would like to
be  able  to  recover  his  full  “contract,”  i.e.,  expectation
damages,  which  would  give  him  a  greater  recovery  than  the
reliance  or  restitution  damages  that  are  all  that  promissory

239

estoppel would allow.

(D) is wrong because unjust enrichment would yield a lesser
recovery  than  a  waiver-of-condition  theory,  since  unjust
enrichment  will  get  Planner  just  the  relatively  small  amount
by  which  he  has  increased  the  value  of  Ohner’s  property,
whereas waiver will permit recovery “on the contract,” i.e.,
for full expectation damages.

II.   CONSTRUCTIVE CONDITIONS

A.  Waiver

Question  34:  Bitz,  an  amateur  computer  whiz,  agreed  in
writing  to  design  for  the  Presskey  Corporation,  a  distributor
of TV game systems, three new games a year for a five-year
period.  The  writing  provided,  in  a  clause  separately  signed
by  Bitz,  that  “No  modification  shall  be  binding  on  Presskey
unless  made  in  writing  and  signed  by  Presskey’s  authorized
representative.”

Because  of  family  problems,  Bitz  delivered  and  Presskey
accepted  only  two  game  designs  a  year  for  the  first  three
years; but the games were a commercial success and Presskey
made  no  objection.  Accordingly,  Bitz  spent  substantial  sums
on  new  computer  equipment  that  would  aid  in  speeding  up
future  design  work.  In  the  first  quarter  of  the  fourth  year,
however, Presskey terminated the contract on the ground that
Bitz had breached the annual-quantity term.

In Bitz’s suit against Presskey for damages, the jury found that
the contract had been modified by conduct and the trial court
awarded Bitz substantial compensatory damages.
Is this result likely to be reversed on appeal?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  contract’s  no-oral-modification  clause

was not expressly waived by Presskey.

(B)    Yes,  because  the  contract’s  no-oral-modification  clause
was a material part of the agreed exchange and could not
be avoided without new consideration.

(C)    No,  because  the  contract’s  no-oral-modification  clause
was unconscionable as against an amateur designer.

240

(D)  No, because Presskey by its conduct waived the annual-
quantity term and Bitz materially changed his position in
reasonable reliance on that waiver.

Answer  34:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  beneficiary  of  a
constructive  condition  may  be  found  to  have  waived  the
condition. Such a waiver may be implied rather than express.
Here,  when  Presskey  accepted  the  two  game-designs  a  year
without  protest  for  three  years,  this  constituted  an  implied
waiver  of  the  minimum-quantity  term,  at  least  as  to  the
already-completed  three  years.  Then,  when  Bitz  spent  the
substantial  sums  on  new  computer  equipment,  this  probably
constituted  a  material  change  of  position  in  reasonable
reliance on this waiver. While it is probably not the case that
no  reasonable  jury  could  have  found  for  Presskey  on  these
facts  (for  instance,  a  reasonable  jury  could  probably  have
found that Bitz’s reliance expenditure was not reasonable), a
reasonable  jury  could  have  found  for  Bitz,  so  an  appellate
affirmance  would  be  proper.  (Note  that  the  question  doesn’t
ask you to predict who would win at trial, merely to predict
whether  Presskey  could  get  a  reversal  of  the  jury  verdict,  a
harder task for Presskey to accomplish.)
(A)  is  wrong  because,  while  a  no-oral-modification  clause
will  normally  be  enforced,  such  a  clause  does  not  prevent
enforcement  of  an  oral  or  implicit  waiver  where  the
conditions  for  waiver  are  satisfied,  as  they  are  here.  (The
difference  between  modification  and  waiver  is  that  a  true
modification — which was forbidden by the n.o.m. clause — 
could  not  have  been  prospectively  retracted,  whereas
Presskey’s  waiver  could  have  been  retracted  by  it  until  Bitz
changed position in reasonable reliance on it.)
(B)  is  wrong  because  it  does  not  apply  on  these  facts — as
described  in  the  discussion  of  Choice  (A)  above,  what
happened here was a waiver rather than an avoidance of the
no-oral-modification  clause’s  effect,  and  a  waiver  is  not
prevented by a n.o.m. clause.
(C) is wrong because the no-oral-modification clause would
not be unconscionable on these facts. It is rare for a clause in
a commercial (as opposed to consumer) contract to be ruled
unconscionable. To be unconscionable, the clause would have

241

to  either  be  shockingly  unfair  substantively,  or  very  unfair
from  a  procedural  perspective.  N.O.M.  clauses  are  quite
routine,  and  the  one  here  would  not  be  found  to  be  either
substantively  or  procedurally  unfair.  The  fact  that  Bitz  was
supposedly  an  “amateur”  designer  would  not  change  this
result, especially since what he was performing was a series
of commercial services.

III.  SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE

A.  Material breach in contracts for the sale of goods

1.  “Perfect tender” rule

a.  Not so strict

i.  Trade usage or course of dealing as “wiggle room”

Question  35:  Computers,  Inc.,  contracted  in  writing  with
Bank to sell and deliver to Bank a mainframe computer using
a new type of magnetic memory, then under development but
not  perfected  by  Computers,  at  a  price  substantially  lower
than that of a similar computer using current technology. The
contract’s delivery term was “F.O.B. Bank, on or before July
31.” Computers tendered the computer to Bank on August 15,
and Bank rejected it because of the delay.
If  Computers  sues  Bank  for  breach  of  contract,  which  of  the
following  facts,  if  proved,  will  best  support  a  recovery  by
Computers?

(A)  The delay did not materially harm Bank.
(B)    Computers  believed,  on  the  assumption  that  Bank  was
getting a “super deal” for its money, that Bank would not
reject because of the late tender of delivery.

(C)    Computers’  delay  in  tender  was  caused  by  a  truckers’

strike.

(D)    A  usage  in  the  relevant  trade  allows  computer  sellers  a
30-day leeway in a specified time of delivery, unless the
usage is expressly negated by the contract.

Answer  35:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  For  one-shot  (i.e.,  non-
installment)  sales  contracts  like  the  one  here,  UCC  §  2-601
states what is, in effect, a perfect tender rule: “[I]f the goods

242

or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to the
contract, the buyer may (a) reject the whole[.]” So Computers
will lose unless it finds a defense that is not inconsistent with
the perfect-tender rule of § 2-601. Section 1-205(3) says that
“[A]ny  usage  of  trade  in  the  vocation  or  trade  in  which  [the
parties] are engaged or of which they are or should be aware
to  and  supplement[s]  or
give[s]  particular  meaning 
qualif[ies]  terms  of  an  agreement.”  So  if  Computers  can
indeed  show  that  under  trade  usage  in  the  purchase  of
computers,  an  apparently  fixed  delivery  date  really  means
“plus or minus 30 days on either side of the specified date,”
the contract will be interpreted in light of this usage. In other
words,  §  2-601  will  still  entitle  Bank  to  reject  if  delivery
were  untimely,  but  the  delivery  won’t  in  fact  be  deemed
untimely because of the trade usage.

(A) is wrong because as described in the analysis of Choice
(D) above, the UCC essentially requires tenders to be perfect
(and  “perfect”  includes  timely  delivery),  so  that  a  defense
based on lack of material harm won’t work.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  goodness  of  the  deal  Bank  was
getting would not entitle Computers to relief from the perfect-
tender rule. As described further in Choice (D) above, UCC §
2-601  essentially  applies  the  perfect  tender  rule  to  non-
installment contracts. Under § 2-601, there is no room for an
argument that because the deal was an unusually good one for
the buyer, the buyer loses its right to reject for late delivery or
other non-conformity.

(C)  is  wrong  because  a  trucker’s  strike  would  not  give
Computers  a  cause  of  action  for  breach.  The  fact  that  the
contract stated “F.O.B. Bank” hurts Computers’ ability to rely
on  the  truckers’  strike.  Section  2-319(1)(b)  says  that  “when
the  [shipment]  term  is  F.O.B.  the  place  of  destination,  the
seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to
that place and there tender delivery of them . . . . ” So a court
would probably hold that use of the F.O.B. destination clause
shifted  to  Computers  the  risk  of  a  problem  with  Computers’
choice  of  delivery  methods.  The  defense  of  commercial
impracticability  might  conceivably  help  Computers  escape
monetary liability  (a  damages  award  against  it)  for  breach,

243

but the section wouldn’t allow it to insist that Bank must take
delivery late; the best that Computers could reasonably hope
for is for both parties to be discharged, not for an affirmative
recovery for breach against Bank.

2.  Cure

a.  Beyond contract

Question  36:  In  a  signed  writing,  a  buyer  contracted  to
purchase  a  25-foot  travel  trailer  from  an  RV  dealer  for
$15,000,  cash  on  delivery  no  later  than  June  1.  The  buyer
arrived at the dealer’s sales lot on Sunday, May 31, to pay for
and take delivery of the trailer, but refused to do so when he
discovered that the spare tire was missing.

The dealer offered to install a spare tire on Monday when its
service department would open, but the buyer replied that he
did  not  want  the  trailer  and  would  purchase  another  one
elsewhere.

Which of the following is accurate?

(A)  The buyer had a right to reject the trailer, but the dealer
was  entitled  to  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  cure  the
defect.

(B)    The  buyer  had  a  right  to  reject  the  trailer  and  terminate

the contract under the perfect tender rule.

(C)  The buyer was required to accept the trailer, because the

defect could be readily cured.

(D)  The buyer was required to accept the trailer, because the

defect did not substantially impair its value.

Answer 36: Choice (A) is correct. The case is governed by
the  UCC,  since  a  trailer,  though  large,  is  still  an  item  of
personal  property  and  thus  constitutes  “goods,”  the  sale  of
which  is  covered  by  Article  2.  To  begin  our  analysis,  if  we
assume  that  the  contracted-for  trailer  was  one  with  a  spare
tire, the buyer was permitted to reject the tendered trailer for
lack of the tire. That’s because § 2-601 says that in a single-
shot (non-installment) contract, “unless otherwise agreed . . .
if  the  goods  or  the  tender  of  delivery  fail  in  any  respect  to
conform  to  the  contract,  the  buyer  may  (a)  reject  the  whole
[.]” So no matter how minor the defect, the buyer was entitled

244

to insist that it be cured before he was required to accept the
trailer. But it does not follow that the defect entitled the buyer
to  cancel  the  contract.  That’s  because  §  2-508(1)  says  that
“where  any  tender  or  delivery  by  the  seller  is  rejected
because non-conforming and the time for performance has not
yet expired, the seller may seasonably notify the buyer of his
intention to cure and may then within the contract time make a
conforming delivery.” Here, the time for performance would
not  expire  until  the  end  of  business  on  Monday,  June  1,  and
the dealer was proposing to cure the problem on Monday, i.e.,
within  the  contract  time.  Therefore,  the  dealer  met  the
notification requirement of § 2-508(1), and had the right to try
to make the actual cure up until the end of June 1.

(B)  is  wrong  because,  while  §  2-601  in  theory  applies  the
perfect tender rule — which would allow the buyer to reject
and  terminate  immediately — that  rule  is  subject  to  the
seller’s right under § 2-508(1) to give notice of intent to cure
within the contract period and to then make the cure.

(C) is wrong because the buyer was not required to accept the
trailer on May 31, with the defect still uncured. And that was
true no matter how easy and probable a timely cure appeared
to  be.  Instead,  the  buyer  was  permitted  to  suspend  his
performance (i.e., his acceptance and payment), wait and see
whether  the  dealer  promptly  cured  the  defect  as  promised,
and if it didn’t, make a final rejection.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  buyer  was  not  required  to  accept
the trailer given the defect, despite the fact that the defect did
not  substantially  impair  the  trailer’s  value.  If  the  tendered
goods  are  defective,  no  matter  how  small  the  defect  is
(assuming it indeed amounts to a true “defect” as opposed to a
permissible  variation  under  relevant  trade  usage),  the  buyer
may  reject  the  goods  if  the  defect  is  not  cured.  To  put  it
another way, there is no doctrine of “substantial performance”
with  respect  to  the  seller’s  obligations  under  a  single-shot
(non-installment) contract for the sale of goods.

IV.  EXCUSE OF CONDITIONS

A.  Hindrance

245

1.  Implied promise of cooperation

Question  37:  A  fugitive  was  wanted  for  murder.  The
authorities offered the following reward: “$20,000 to anyone
who provides information leading to the arrest and conviction
of  this  fugitive.”  A  private  detective  knew  of  the  reward,
located  the  fugitive,  and  brought  him  to  the  authorities,  who
arrested  him.  The  authorities  then  determined  that  while  the
fugitive  had,  in  fact,  committed  the  crime,  he  had  been
directed to commit the crime by his boss. The authorities and
the  fugitive  then  agreed  that  in  exchange  for  the  fugitive’s
testimony  against  his  boss,  all  charges  against  the  fugitive
would  be  dropped.  The  fugitive  testified  and  was  released.
The  authorities  refused  to  pay  the  reward  to  the  private
detective on the ground that the fugitive was never convicted.

Would the private detective be likely to prevail in a breach of
contract action against the authorities?

(A)    No,  because  the  private  detective  failed  to  notify  the

authorities that he had accepted the reward offer.

(B)  No, because the express conditions set out in the reward

were not met.

(C)  Yes, because the authorities’ agreement with the fugitive

was against public policy.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  authorities  themselves  prevented  the

conviction of the fugitive.

Answer  37:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  A  performance  that  is
subject to an express condition cannot become due unless the
condition  occurs  or  its  nonoccurrence  is  excused.  The
detective’s  entitlement  to  the  award  was  subject  to  two
conditions — the  arrest  and  conviction  of  the  fugitive.  The
first, the arrest, was satisfied when the detective delivered the
fugitive to the authorities. The second, the conviction, did not
occur.  Its  nonoccurrence  is  excused,  however,  under  the
doctrine  of  prevention,  which  requires  that  a  party  refrain
from  conduct  that  prevents  or  hinders  the  occurrence  of  a
condition.  See  Farnsworth,  §8.6,  p.  544:  “The  duty  of  good
faith and fair dealing that is usually imposed requires at least
that  a  party  do  nothing  to  prevent  the  occurrence  of  a
condition of that party’s duty.” The authorities had it in their

246

power to obtain a conviction, and would ordinarily have done
so by routine procedures; the fact that they chose to give up a
conviction in order to get the fugitive’s testimony against the
boss  brings  the  case  within  this  rule  that  a  party  whose
conduct  prevents  the  occurrence  of  a  condition  cannot  then
claim  the  benefit  of  that  non-occurrence.  See  also  Rest.  2d
§245, Comment a.

is  often  required 

to  give  notice  of 

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  cites  a  requirement  that  does  not
apply  to  these  facts.  It’s  true  that  in  an  offer  for  a  unilateral
contract,  an  offeree  who  accepts  by  rendering  the  requested
performance 
that
acceptance. But the offeree’s duty to give notice of acceptance
applies only if the offeree has reason to know that the offeror
would not learn of the requested performance with reasonable
certainty and promptness after that performance has occurred.
That’s  not  the  case  here,  since  the  offeror  learned  of  the
performance  when  the  detective  took  the  fugitive  to  the
authorities,  i.e.,  at  the  very  time  the  requested  performance
occurred. Rest. 2d, §54(2).

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  overlooks  the  doctrine  of  excuse  of
conditions.  The  general  rule  is  that  a  party’s  performance
does  not  become  due  until  all  express  conditions  to  it  have
occurred  or  are  excused.  In  this  case,  the  detective’s
entitlement to the award was subject to two conditions, one of
which  (conviction  of  the  fugitive)  was  excused  under  the
doctrine  of  prevention,  which  requires  that  a  party  refrain
from  conduct  that  prevents  or  hinders  the  occurrence  of  a
condition.  See  the  discussion  of  Choice  (D)  for  more  about
the doctrine of excuse of conditions.

(C) is wrong because it’s unresponsive to the question. That’s
so  because  this  choice  relates  to  the  enforceability  of  the
agreement between the fugitive and the authorities rather than
the  enforceability  of  the  purported  contract  between  the
authorities  and  the  detective.  The  dispositive  issue  is  the
effect  of  the  nonoccurrence  of  an  express  condition.  As
discussed  further  in  (D)  above,  that  nonoccurrence  was
excused  by  the  authorities’  preventing  the  conviction  by
making the plea deal.

CHAPTER 7
ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION AND
OTHER ASPECTS OF BREACH

I.    ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION

A.  What constitutes repudiation

1.  Statement

a.  Grudging willingness to perform

Question 38: Broker needed a certain rare coin to complete a
set that he had contracted to assemble and sell to Collecta. On
February  1,  Broker  obtained  such  a  coin  from  Hoarda  in
exchange for $1,000 and Broker’s signed, written promise to
re-deliver to Hoarda “not later than December 31 this year” a
comparable specimen of the same kind of coin without charge
to  Hoarda.  On  February  2,  Broker  consummated  sale  of  the
complete set to Collecta.
On October 1, the market price of rare coins suddenly began a
rapid,  sustained  rise;  and  on  October  15  Hoarda  wrote
Broker  for  assurance  that  the  latter  would  timely  meet  his
coin-replacement  commitment.  Broker  replied,  “In  view  of
the  surprising  market,  it  seems  unfair  that  I  should  have  to
replace your coin within the next few weeks.”

Having  received  Broker’s  message  on  October  17,  Hoarda
sued  Broker  on  November  15  for  the  market  value  of  a
comparable  replacement-coin  as  promised  by  Broker  in
February. The trial began on December 1.
If Broker moves to dismiss Hoarda’s complaint, which of the
following is Broker’s best argument in support of the motion?
(A)  Broker did not repudiate the contract on October 17, and
may  still  perform  no  later  than  the  contract  deadline  of
December 31.

(B)  Even if Broker repudiated on October 17, Hoarda’s only
action  would  be  for  specific  performance  because  the
coin is a unique chattel.

(C)    Under  the  doctrine  of  impossibility,  which  includes

248

unusually  burdensome  and  unforeseen  impracticability,
Broker is temporarily excused by the market conditions
from  timely  performnance  of  his  coin-replacement
obligation.

(D)  Even if Broker repudiated on October 17, Hoarda has no
remedy  without  first  demanding  in  writing  that  Broker
retract his repudiation.

Answer  38:  Choice  (A) 
is  correct.  To  constitute  a
repudiation, a party must clearly bring home to the other party
that  he  will  be  unable  or  unwilling  to  perform.  Mere
expression  of  doubts  about  performance,  or  statements  that
performance would be burdensome or unfair, will usually not
constitute a sufficiently clear indication of an impending non-
performance.  Therefore,  Broker’s  statement  that  it  “seems
unfair”  that  he  should  have  to  honor  the  contract  in  a  timely
manner  probably  did  not  constitute  a  repudiation.  It  is  not
certain that Broker will succeed with this argument, but of the
four presented, it is the one that has by far the best chance of
success for him.

(B) is wrong because it is a flat misstatement of law. While
Hoarda  would  probably  be  entitled 
to  seek  specific
performance  due  to  the  coin’s  status  as  a  unique  chattel,  the
plaintiff is always free to decline to seek a remedy of specific
performance and to instead seek money damages if these can
be proved with sufficient certainty (and there is no indication
here that they could not be).

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  facts  here  would  not  support  the
temporary impossibility defense. The defense of impossibility
is not available to a party if a court would conclude that the
agreement implicitly placed on that party the risk of the type
of event that has occurred. The market prices of rare coins are
constantly fluctuating, sometimes severely, and a court would
almost  certainly  conclude  that  Broker,  when  he  undertook  to
replace  Hoarda’s  coin  within  a  defined  period,  implicitly
took the risk that the price of doing so would increase sharply.
This result is especially likely in view of the fact that Broker
was in the business of buying and selling such coins.
(D) is wrong because when one party repudiates, the other is
not  required  to  demand  (in  writing  or  otherwise)  that  the

249

repudiation be retracted. It is true that the repudiatee has the
right  to  demand  a  retraction,  but  the  repudiatee  may  instead
elect  to  treat  the  repudiation  as  final  and  immediately  sue
upon it.

Question 39:  On  June  1,  a  seller  and  a  buyer  contracted  in
writing for the sale and purchase of the seller’s cattle ranch (a
large single tract), and to close the transaction on December
1.

On  October  1,  the  buyer  told  the  seller,  “I’m  increasingly
unhappy  about  our  June  1  contract  because  of  the  current
cattle market, and do not intend to buy your ranch unless I’m
legally  obligated  to  do  so.”  If  the  seller  sues  the  buyer  on
October 15 for breach of contract, the seller will probably

(A)    win,  because  the  buyer  committed  a  total  breach  by

anticipatory repudiation on October 1.

(B)    win,  because  the  buyer’s  October  1  statement  created
reasonable  grounds  for  the  seller’s  insecurity  with
respect to the buyer’s performance.

(C)    lose,  because  the  parties  contracted  for  the  sale  and
conveyance of a single tract, and the seller cannot bring
suit  for  breach  of  such  a  contract  prior  to  the  agreed
closing date.

(D)    lose,  because  the  buyer’s  October  1  statement  to  the
seller was neither a repudiation nor a present breach of
the June 1 contract.

Answer  39:  The  correct  choice  is  (D),  because  the  buyer
stated she would buy the ranch if legally obligated to do so.
An  anticipatory  repudiation  is  a  clear  statement  by  a  party,
made  before  performance  under  a  contract  is  due,  that  the
party  does  not  intend  to  perform.  For  a  statement  by  the
promisor  to  constitute  a  repudiation,  it  must  appear  to  the
promisee that the promisor is quite unlikely to perform. It is
not  enough  that  the  promisor  states  vague  doubts  about  her
willingness or ability to perform. The buyer’s statement here
does  not  meet  these  requirements:  She  has  not  made  it  clear
that she probably won’t perform — indeed, just the contrary,
since she’s indicated that she will perform if legally required
to do so.

250

An anticipatory repudiation is treated as if it were a present
breach.  But  since  the  statement  here  is  not  an  anticipatory
repudiation,  and  since  there  is  no  other  present  breach  (the
time for performance won’t arrive until December), there has
been no breach, and the seller will lose if the case is decided
before December.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  buyer  stated  she  would  buy  if
legally obligated to do so. As described in the discussion of
choice  D  above,  the  buyer’s  statement  did  not  meet  the
requirements  for  an  anticipatory  repudiation,  because  the
buyer indicated that she would perform if required to do so.

these  assurances, 

this  failure  will 

(B)  is  wrong,  because  the  seller  has  not  yet  requested
assurances.  A  party  to  a  contract  has  the  right  to  demand
reasonable assurances when the other party to a contract gives
an ambiguous indication of not performing. If the latter fails to
provide 
itself  be
considered a repudiation and a breach. The buyer’s October 1
statement  indeed  created  reasonable  grounds  for  the  seller’s
insecurity with respect to the buyer’s performance. However,
before the seller could claim repudiation and sue for breach
of  contract,  he  was  obligated  to  request  assurances  from  the
buyer.  If  the  buyer  then  did  not  give  the  seller  the  requested
assurances, the seller could treat this failure as a repudiation.
However,  under  these  facts,  the  seller  has  not  yet  requested
assurances,  so  the  seller  cannot  successfully  claim  that  a
breach has occurred.

(C) is wrong because a seller can bring suit prior to closing if
the buyer anticipatorily repudiates. One of the major purposes
of  the  anticipatory  repudiation  doctrine  is  that  it  allows  the
repudiatee  to  bring  an  immediate  suit  for  breach,  before  the
time  for  performance  has  arrived.  So  if  the  buyer  had
anticipatorily repudiated, the seller could bring an immediate
suit,  and  choice  C  would  be  an  incorrect  statement.  Beyond
this problem, of course, there is the additional difficulty (for
the  seller)  that  the  buyer’s  words  “I  won’t  perform  unless
legally obligated” are not an anticipatory repudiation, for the
reasons described in the discussion of choice D above.

II.   OTHER ASPECTS OF REPUDIATION

251

A.  Retraction of repudiation

1.  Final acts

a.  Cancellation and new contract with someone else

i.  Real estate

Question 40:  On  June  1,  a  seller  and  a  buyer  contracted  in
writing for the sale and purchase of the seller’s cattle ranch,
and  to  close  the  transaction  on  December  1.  The  buyer
unequivocally repudiated the contract on August 1. On August
15, the seller urged the buyer to change her mind and proceed
with  the  scheduled  closing  on  December  1.  On  October  1,
having  heard  nothing  further  from  the  buyer,  the  seller  sold
and  conveyed  his  ranch  to  a  third  party — a  rancher — 
without  notice  to  the  buyer.  On  December  1,  the  buyer
attempted to close under the June 1 contract by tendering the
full purchase price to the seller. The seller rejected the tender.

If  the  buyer  sues  the  seller  for  breach  of  contract,  the  buyer
will probably
(A)    win,  because  the  seller  failed  seasonably  to  notify  the

buyer of any pending sale to the rancher.

(B)    win,  because  the  seller  waived  the  buyer’s  August  1
repudiation by urging her to retract it on August 15.
(C)    lose,  because  the  buyer  did  not  retract  her  repudiation
before  the  seller  materially  changed  his  position  in
reliance thereon by selling the ranch to the rancher.
(D)    lose,  because  acceptance  of  the  purchase  price  by  the
seller  was  a  concurrent  condition  to  the  seller’s
obligation to convey the ranch to the buyer on December
1.

Answer  40:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  A  repudiation  may  be
retracted  until  the  aggrieved  party  has  either  (i)  sued  for
breach, (ii) changed his position materially in reliance on the
repudiation,  or  (iii)  stated  that  he  regards  the  repudiation  as
final. Rest. 2d § 256(1). Under these facts, the buyer had from
August 1, when she unequivocally repudiated the contract, to
October  1  to  retract  her  unequivocal  repudiation.  The  buyer
didn’t do so. The buyer’s right to retract her repudiation and
perform  under  the  contract  ended  when  the  seller  materially

252

changed his position in reliance on the repudiation, by selling
to the rancher. The fact that the seller initially urged the buyer
to  change  her  mind  does  not  alter  the  analysis — under  the
modern view, the repudiatee’s exhortation to the repudiator to
perform does not “reinstate the contract,” and does not impair
the  repudiatee’s  subsequent  right  to  cancel  the  contract  or
change position in reliance on the repudiation.

(A) is wrong because the seller had no obligation to notify the
buyer  that  the  seller  was  viewing  the  contract  as  being  in
material  breach.  A  repudiation  may  be  retracted  until  the
aggrieved  party  has  done  any  of  three  things  (see  the
discussion  of  Choice  (C)  above),  one  of  which  is  to
materially  change  position  in  reliance  on  the  repudiation.
While the seller had the right to notify the buyer that the seller
was viewing the contract as terminated and preparing to sell
to someone else (and such a notice would have immediately
ended  the  buyer’s  right  to  retract  the  repudiation,  under  the
third  branch  of  the  Restatement  test  cited  above),  the  seller
did not have the obligation to give this notice before changing
position.

(B) is wrong because the seller did not waive the repudiation
by  urging  performance.  Under 
the
repudiatee’s exhortation to the repudiator to perform does not
“reinstate the contract,” and does not impair the repudiatee’s
right to cancel the contract or change position in reliance on
the repudiation.

the  modern  view, 

(D) is wrong because this choice misstates the law both as to
a  repudiation  and  a  non-repudiation  scenario.  For  instance,
suppose  that  the  buyer  never  repudiated  and  tendered  the
contract price on December 1, and the seller refused either to
accept the money or convey the ranch — in that scenario the
buyer  would  win,  whereas  the  language  of  Choice  (D)  says
that the buyer would lose. Beyond that, of course, the fact that
the buyer had repudiated long before Dec. 1 entitled the seller
to cancel the contract and convey to someone else, making the
buyer’s  later  tender  of  the  contract  price  (and  whether  the
seller accepted that tender) irrelevant.

B.  Special UCC rules

253

1.  Party has choice of remedies

Question 41: Broker needed a certain rare coin to complete a
set that he had contracted to assemble and sell to Collecta. On
February  1,  Broker  obtained  such  a  coin  from  Hoarda  in
exchange for $1,000 and Broker’s signed, written promise to
re-deliver to Hoarda “not later than December 31 this year” a
comparable specimen of the same kind of coin without charge
to  Hoarda.  On  February  2,  Broker  consummated  sale  of  the
complete set to Collecta.

On October 1, the market price of rare coins suddenly began a
rapid,  sustained  rise;  and  on  October  15  Hoarda  wrote
Broker  for  assurance  that  the  latter  would  timely  meet  his
coin-replacement  commitment.  Broker  replied,  “In  view  of
the  surprising  market,  it  seems  unfair  that  I  should  have  to
replace your coin within the next few weeks.”

After  receiving  Broker’s  message  on  October  17,  Hoarda
telephoned  Broker,  who  said,  “I  absolutely  will  not  replace
your coin until the market drops far below its present level.”
Hoarda  then  sued  Broker  on  November  15  for  the  market
value  of  a  comparable  replacement-coin  as  promised  by
Broker in February. The trial began on December 1.

If Broker moves to dismiss Hoarda’s complaint, which of the
following is Hoarda’s best argument in opposing the motion?

(A)    Hoarda’s  implied  duty  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing  in
enforcement  of  the  contract  required  her  to  mitigate  her
losses on the rising market by suing promptly, as she did,
after  becoming 
a
prospective breach by Broker.

apprehensive  of 

reasonably 

(B)    Although  the  doctrine  of  anticipatory  breach  is  not
applicable  under  the  prevailing  view  if,  at  the  time  of
repudiation,  the  repudiatee  owes  the  repudiator  no
remaining  duty  of  performance,  the  doctrine  applies  in
this  case  because  Hoarda,  the  repudiatee,  remains
potentially liable under an implied warranty that the coin
advanced to Broker was genuine.

(C)  When either party to a sale-of-goods contract repudiates
with  respect  to  a  performance  not  yet  due,  the  loss  of
which will substantially impair the value of the contract

254

to the other, the aggrieved party may in good faith resort
to any appropriate remedy for breach.

(D)    Anticipatory  repudiation,  as  a  deliberate  disruption
without 
legal  excuse  of  an  ongoing  contractual
relationship  between  the  parties,  may  be  treated  by  the
repudiatee at her election as a present tort, actionable at
once.

Answer  41:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  This  is  a  sale-of-goods
repudiation
the  UCC’s  special  anticipatory 
case,  so 
provision,  §  2-610,  applies.  That  section  says  that  “when
either  party  repudiates  the  contract  with  respect  to  a
performance  not  yet  due  the  loss  of  which  will  substantially
impair  the  value  of  the  contract  to  the  other,  the  aggrieved
party  may  .  .  .  (b)  resort  to  any  remedy  for  breach[.]”  This
section  applies  to  these  facts,  and  almost  perfectly  matches
the  phrasing  in  Choice  (C):  Broker  has  repudiated  his
obligation  to  deliver  a  replacement  coin  by  Dec.  31;  this
repudiation  has  substantially  impaired  the  value  of  the
contract to Hoarda (since Broker’s insistence on waiting for
prices to come down means that the delay may be infinite, and
will  expose  Hoarda  to  an  ever-increasing  financial  loss  if
prices  continue  to  mount);  and  a  suit  for  the  market  value  of
the promised coin is an authorized “remedy for breach” in the
circumstances.

(A)  is  wrong  because  Hoarda  had  no  duty  to  mitigate  her
losses in the rising market by suing promptly. UCC § 2-610(a)
gives Hoarda the right to “for a commercially reasonable time
await  performance  by  the  repudiating  party.”  So  Hoarda
could  have  waited  a  while,  and  didn’t  have  to  mitigate  her
damages  by  bringing  suit  immediately  (although  for  the
reasons  described  in  Choice  (C)  she  had  the  right  to  bring
such an immediate suit).

(B) is wrong because, while it is true that in non-UCC cases,
the  repudiatee  cannot  bring  suit  prior  to  the  time  for  the
performance  if  the  repudiatee  has  no  remaining  duty  of
performance, this special rule does not apply to UCC cases.
Therefore, it wouldn’t matter whether Hoarda did or did not
have a surviving implied warranty that the coin she advanced
to Broker was genuine.

255

(D) is wrong because, while this choice correctly states that
the  repudiatee  may  bring  suit  at  once,  the  choice  incorrectly
states that this action would be for a “present tort.” When the
doctrine  of  anticipatory  repudiation  allows  suit,  the  suit  is  a
form of breach-of-contract action, not a tort suit.

CHAPTER 8
STATUTE OF FRAUDS

I.    SURETYSHIP

A.  Main purpose rule

1.  Often tested on MBE

a.  Question may not mention Statute of Frauds

Question 42: A father and his adult daughter encountered an
old family friend on the street. The daughter said to the friend,
“How about lending me $1,000 to buy a used car? I’ll pay you
back  with  interest  one  year  from  today.”  The  father  added,
“And  if  she  doesn’t  pay  it  back  as  promised,  I  will.”  The
friend  thereupon  wrote  out  and  handed  to  the  daughter  his
personal  check,  payable  to  her,  for  $1,000,  and  the  daughter
subsequently used the funds to buy a used car. When the debt
became due, both the daughter and the father refused to repay
it, or any part of it.

In an action by the friend against the father to recover $1,000
plus  interest,  which  of  the  following  statements  would
summarize the father’s best defense?
(A)  He received no consideration for his conditional promise

to the friend.

(B)    His  conditional  promise  to  the  friend  was  not  to  be
performed in less than a year from the time it was made.
(C)    His  conditional  promise  to  the  friend  was  not  made  for
the primary purpose of benefiting himself (the father).
(D)  The loan by the friend was made without any agreement

concerning the applicable interest rate.

Answer  42:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  daughter  is  the
primary  obligor  on  the  debt  to  the  friend.  The  father,  by
promising  to  make  the  payment  if  the  daughter  doesn’t,  has
promised  to  “answer  for  the  debt  of  another,”  making  him  a
surety.  Since  the  father’s  promise  is  oral,  it  is  rendered
unenforceable  by  the  suretyship  provision  of  the  Statute  of
Frauds,  unless  some  exception  makes  it  inapplicable.  The

257

most  important  exception  to  the  suretyship  provision  is  the
main purpose rule. But here, the fact that the father’s promise
was  not  made  for  the  “primary  purpose”  (i.e.,  “main
purpose”)  of  benefiting  the  father’s  own  economic  interests
means that the main purpose rule does not apply, making the
suretyship provision applicable. (Notice that nowhere in this
choice do the examiners mention either the Statute of Frauds,
the  concept  of  suretyship,  or  the  significance  of  the  fact  that
the  promise  was  oral — it’s  up  to  you  to  notice  that  the
reference to the absence of “primary purpose” means that the
suretyship provision will apply.)

(A) is wrong because the father did receive consideration for
his conditional promise — the friend’s making of the loan to
the daughter. Consideration need not be given to the promisor,
but  can  instead  be  given  to  a  third  party,  as  long  as  the
promisor bargained for it.

(B) is wrong because it refers to the not-performable-within-
one year provision of the Statute of Frauds, and that provision
does not apply to the father’s promise here. The reason is that
there  is  a  special  exception  under  which  “the  one-year
provision does not apply to a contract which is performed on
one side at the time it is made, such as a loan of money, nor
to  any  contract  which  has  been  fully  performed  on  one  side,
whether the performance is completed within a year or not.”
Rest.  2d,  §  130,  Comment  d.  Since  the  friend  has  fully
the  full
performed  on  his  side  by  making 
performance  removed  the  entire  contract  from  the  one-year
provision.

loan, 

the 

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  law  will  supply  a  reasonable
interest rate under the circumstances, so that the contract (and
the  father’s  promise)  will  not  be  void  for  indefiniteness.  As
long  as  the  term  omitted  by  the  parties’  agreement  is  not  so
basic  as  to  prevent  them  from  having  had  a  meeting  of  the
minds, the court will supply the missing term by implication.
Here, since the friend cares mainly about getting his principal
back,  he  can  stipulate  that  the  interest  rate  was  0%,  and  the
court  will  certainly  be  willing  to  apply  that  rate  to  save  the
contract from indefiniteness.

II.   SATISFACTION BY A MEMORANDUM

A.  UCC

1.  Confirmation

Question  43:  A  skiing  retailer,  in  a  telephone  conversation
with  a  glove  manufacturer,  ordered  12  pairs  of  vortex-lined
ski gloves at the manufacturer’s list price of $600 per dozen
“for  delivery  in  30  days.”  The  manufacturer  orally  accepted
the  offer,  and  immediately  faxed  to  the  ski  shop  this  signed
memo: “Confirming our agreement today for your purchase of
a  dozen  pairs  of  vortex-lined  ski  gloves  for  $600,  the
shipment will be delivered in 30 days.” Although the retailer
received and read the manufacturer’s message within minutes
after  its  dispatch,  she  changed  her  mind  three  weeks  later
about  the  purchase  and  rejected  the  conforming  shipment
when it timely arrived.

On  learning  of  the  rejection,  does  the  manufacturer  have  a
cause of action against the retailer for breach of contract?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  gloves  were  identified  to  the  contract

and tendered to the retailer.

(B)    Yes,  because  the  manufacturer’s  faxed  memo  to  the
the  agreement

to  make 

sufficient 

retailer  was 
enforceable.

(C)  No, because the agreed price was $600 and the retailer
never  signed  a  writing  evidencing  a  contract  with  the
manufacturer.

(D)  No, because the retailer neither paid for nor accepted any

of the goods tendered.

Answer 43:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Normally,  a  contract  for
the  sale  of  goods  having  a  value  of  more  than  $500  is  not
enforceable  unless  memorialized  in  a  writing  signed  by  the
party  against  whom  enforcement  is  sought,  here,  the  retailer.
However,  there  is  an  important  exception  for  confirmations
sent  between  merchants.  According  to  UCC  §  2-201(2),
“Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in
confirmation  of  the  contract  and  sufficient  against  the  sender
is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its
contents,  it  satisfies  the  requirements  of  [the  Statute  of

259

Frauds] against such party unless written notice of objection
to its contents is given within 10 days after it is received.” So
here,  even  though  the  retailer  didn’t  sign  anything,  the
confirmation  makes  the  contract  good  against  her  under  §  2-
201(2), because: (1) the retailer and the manufacturer are both
merchants;  (2)  the  manufacturer  signed  the  confirmation,  so
that  the  confirmation  would  have  been  binding  against  the
manufacturer;  (3)  the  retailer  had  “reason  to  know  [the
confirmation’s]  contents”  (because  she  read  it);  and  (4)  the
retailer  did  not  indicate  her  objection  to  the  memorandum’s
contents within 10 days after receiving it.

(A) is wrong because the fact that the goods were “identified
to  the  contract”  is  irrelevant  to  the  enforceability  of  the
contract — even if the retailer had canceled before the goods
were  shipped  (or  even  before  the  goods  were  identified
within  the  manufacturer’s  plant  as  being  the  ones  that  would
be shipped to the retailer), the manufacturer would still have
been  entitled  to  sue  for  breach  if  more  than  10  days  had
passed  since  the  retailer  received  the  confirmation.  (The
MBE examiners are probably trying to fool you into thinking
of  §  2-709,  under  which  the  fact  that  the  goods  have  been
identified to the contract will entitle the seller to sue for the
full  contract  price  if  the  seller  cannot  resell  them  at  a
turn  an
reasonable  price — but 
otherwise-unenforceable  contract  into  an  enforceable  one;  it
merely  governs  the  measure  of  damages  for  an  already-
enforceable contract.)

this  provision  doesn’t 

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  retailer  is  liable  despite  never
having signed a writing, due to her receipt of a confirmation
and her lack of objection to it, as described in the discussion
of Choice (B) above.
(D) is wrong because the fact that the retailer never paid for
or  accepted  any  of  the  goods  is  irrelevant — the  retailer  is
bound  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  she  received  a  signed
confirmation  and  failed  to  object  to  it,  and  this  is  true
regardless  of  whether  she  paid  for  or  accepted  any  of  the
goods.

CHAPTER 9
REMEDIES

I.    EQUITABLE REMEDIES

A.  Two types

1.  Specific performance

Question 44: A landowner owned a lot in fee simple. For a
consideration of $5,000, the landowner gave a buyer a written
option  to  purchase  the  lot  for  $300,000.  The  option  was
assignable.  For  a  consideration  of  $10,000,  the  buyer
subsequently  gave  an  option  to  a  speculator  to  purchase  the
lot for $325,000. The speculator exercised his option.

The buyer thereupon exercised his option. The buyer paid the
agreed  price  of  $300,000  and  took  title  to  the  lot  by  deed
from  the  landowner.  Thereafter,  the  speculator  refused  to
consummate  his  purchase.  The  buyer  brought  an  appropriate
action  against  the  speculator  for  specific  performance,  or,  if
that  should  be  denied,  then  for  damages.  The  speculator
counterclaimed  for  return  of  the  $10,000.  In  this  action,  the
court will
(A)  grant money damages only to the buyer.
(B)  grant specific performance to the buyer.
(C)  grant the buyer only the right to retain the $10,000.
(D)  require the buyer to refund the $10,000 to the speculator.
Answer  44:  Choice  (B)  is  correct,  because  it  correctly
identifies  that  the  buyer  is  entitled  to  the  remedy  he  wanted:
specific performance.
Understanding  why  specific  performance  is  the  appropriate
remedy  requires  that  you  analyze  the  facts  with  two  rules  in
mind:  first,  specific  performance  is  an  equitable  remedy,
requiring  as  a  prerequisite  that  there  be  no  adequate  remedy
“at law” (i.e., money damages). This occurs, typically, where
the subject is unique — e.g., a piece of land or an antique — 
and/or the money value is not ascertainable. Second, in land
sale contracts, when the seller refuses to convey the property,

261

the  buyer  can  seek  specific  performance.  That’s  pretty
straightforward. But the rule that’s less obvious is that if the
buyer  refuses  to  carry  out  the  sale,  the  seller  can  usually
compel  performance — even  though  the  buyer  will  only  be
paying money, as he would in a damages claim!

With that in mind, look closely at what happens in these facts.
The buyer has an option to buy the lot for $300,000. He then
makes  an  irrevocable  offer  to  the  speculator  to  purchase  the
lot  for  $325,000.  The  speculator  exercises  his  option,
meaning  the  buyer  is  bound  to  exercise  his  own  option.  The
buyer  exercises  his  option,  pays  the  $300,000,  and  takes  the
deed to the lot. Only at that point does the speculator renege
on the deal. Thus, what you have is the buyer holding the title
to  the  lot,  and  the  speculator  refusing  to  carry  out  an
enforceable  duty — paying  a  stipulated  amount  and  taking
title to the lot. Thus, what’s involved is a land sale contract 
— a  classic  specific  performance  situation!  Note  that  the
reason money damages are inadequate in a case like this — 
where the buyer refuses to carry out a land sale contract — is
the  seller’s  difficulties  of  proof.  In  a  damages  action,  the
damage  would  consist  of  the  difference  between  the  market
value  of 
the  contract  price  (plus
consequential  damages,  like  expenses  of  finding  another
buyer). So the seller would have to establish the market value
of  the  land  at  the  time  of  the  breach,  and  that  might  be  a
speculative  and  hard-to-prove  amount.  Specific  performance
relieves the seller of this burden of proof: All he has to show
is the contract price.

the  property  and 

(A) is wrong, for the reason explained in (B): The buyer/re-
seller  is  entitled  to  specific  performance,  because  money
damages would be inadequate due to difficulties of proof.
(C) is wrong because it understates the buyer’s recovery; he’s
entitled to specific performance of the option contract, for the
reasons discussed in (B). If the buyer is unable to recover the
the
exercise  price  specified  under  his  contract  with 
speculator, the buyer will be out of pocket for the amount he
spent to buy the lot from the original seller.
(D)  is  wrong  because  it  ignores  entirely  the  fact  that  the
speculator breached the contract with the buyer, and thus the

262

buyer  will  be  entitled  to  some  kind  of  remedy.  In  fact,  the
buyer will be entitled to the remedy he requested — specific
performance.

B.  Limitations on equitable remedies

1.  Inadequacy of damages

Question 45: Elda, the aged mother of Alice and Barry, both
adults,  wished  to  employ  a  live-in  companion  so  that  she
might  continue  to  live  in  her  own  home.  Elda,  however,  had
only  enough  income  to  pay  one-half  of  the  companion’s
$2,000  monthly  salary.  Learning  of  their  mother’s  plight,
Alice  and  Barry  agreed  with  each  other  in  a  signed  writing
that  on  the  last  day  of  January  and  each  succeeding  month
during  their  mother’s  lifetime,  each  would  give  Elda  $500.
Elda then hired the companion.

Alice  and  Barry  made  the  agreed  payments  in  January,
February,  and  March.  In  April,  however,  Barry  refused  to
make any payment and notified Alice and Elda that he would
make no further payments.

Assume that there is a valid contract between Alice and Barry
and that Elda has declined to sue Barry. Will Alice succeed in
an  action  against  Barry  in  which  she  asks  the  court  to  order
Barry  to  continue  to  make  his  payments  to  Elda  under  the
terms of the Alice-Barry contract?

(A)  Yes, because Alice’s remedy at law is inadequate.
(B)    Yes,  because  Alice’s  burden  of  supporting  her  mother
will be increased if Barry does not contribute his share.
(C)  No, because a court will not grant specific performance

of a promise to pay money.

(D)    No,  because  Barry’s  breach  of  contract  has  caused  no

economic harm to Alice.

Answer  45:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Alice’s  request  that  the
court  order  Barry  to  continue  making  his  payments  is  a
request  for  a  decree  of  specific  performance.  The  principal
requirement that Alice must satisfy in order to get this (or any)
form of equitable relief is to show that legal relief — i.e., an
award of money damages — would not be adequate to protect
her. One reason for which an award of money damages might

263

not be adequate is that the amount of the damage award cannot
be computed with reasonable accuracy. Here, we don’t know
how long Elda will live, so the number of payments that Barry
will  end  up  being  legally  obligated  to  make  is  unknown.
Therefore, the court cannot accurately assess a single amount
as a damage award that represents the certain present value of
Barry’s obligation, and an award of “$500 per month for the
rest of Elda’s life” is a more accurate solution.

(B) is wrong because, while the burden on Alice will indeed
increase by virtue of Barry’s non-performance, this fact alone
would  not  entitle  Alice  to  a  decree  of  specific  performance
rather than an award of damages. Alice will have to show that
money  damages  are  not  an  adequate  remedy,  and  the  reason
that this is true is as discussed in the analysis of Choice (A).

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  is  a  misstatement  of  law — there
simply  is  no  rule  that  courts  will  not  grant  specific
performance  of  a  promise  to  pay  money.  (Indeed,  where  the
contract calls for a series of payments in return for some sort
of ongoing performance, a decree that the payments be made
as scheduled is likely to be preferable to a one-shot award of
money  damages,  because  the  decree  better  protects  the
defendant’s interest in getting the ongoing return performance
in exchange for his payments.)
(D) is wrong because there is no requirement that a plaintiff
show  economic  harm  from  the  defendant’s  breach.  Often  the
promisee in a third-party beneficiary scenario does not suffer
economic  harm  if  the  promisor  fails  to  render  the  promised
performance  to  the  third-party,  but  such  promises  are
nonetheless enforceable by the promisee. It’s true that there is
a  requirement  that  the  defendant’s  promise  have  been
supported  by  consideration;  but  here,  the  consideration  for
Barry’s promise was Alice’s return promise to pay her half of
each  monthly  payment,  so  the  fact  that  Alice  herself  is
suffering  no  economic  harm  from  Barry’s  breach  of  his
payment obligation does not mean that Barry’s promise lacked
consideration.

2.  Difficulty of enforcement

a.  Personal service contract

264

Question  46:  On  November  15,  a  carpenter  in  a  signed
writing  contracted  with  a  homeowner  for  an  agreed  price  to
personally  remodel  the  homeowner’s  kitchen  according  to
specifications provided by the homeowner, and to start work
on December 1. The carpenter agreed to provide all materials
for the job in addition to all of the labor required.

the  contract,  and 

the  carpenter  without 

legal  excuse
On  November  26 
repudiated 
the  homeowner,  after  a
reasonable  and  prolonged  effort,  could  not  find  anyone  to
remodel  his  kitchen  for  a  price  approximating  the  price
agreed  to  by  the  carpenter.  If  one  year  later  the  homeowner
brings  an  action  for  specific  performance  against  the
carpenter, which of the following will provide the carpenter
with the best defense?

(A)    An  action  for  equitable  relief  not  brought  within  a

reasonable time is barred by laches.

(B)    Specific  performance  is  generally  not  available  as  a
remedy to enforce a contractual duty to perform personal
services.

(C)    Specific  performance  is  generally  not  available  as  a
remedy in the case of an anticipatory repudiation.
(D)  Specific performance is not available as a remedy where
even  nominal  damages  could  have  been  recovered  as  a
remedy at law.

Answer  46:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Courts  will  usually  not
grant specific performance of an individual’s duty to perform
personal  services,  because  of  the  difficulties  in  supervising
the  defendant’s  ongoing  performance,  and  the  distastefulness
of ordering what amounts to involuntary servitude. Here, for
instance, if the court grants an order compelling the carpenter
to  do  the  work  at  the  contracted-for  price  and  in  the
contracted-for  time  period,  the  court  may  have  to  make
constant decisions about whether the carpenter is keeping up
to
to 
specifications,  so  that  the  court  risks  becoming  enmeshed  in
burdensome  project  details,  which  the  court  probably  will
conclude is not a sensible use of judicial resources. Also, the
court  may  have  to  imprison  the  carpenter  if  he  doesn’t
perform, a consequence that seems somewhat like slavery.

the  schedule  and  doing 

the  work  according 

265

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  requirements  for  laches  have  not
been satisfied here. It is true that if a plaintiff who is seeking
equitable  relief  unjustifiably  “sleeps  on  his  rights,”  the
defense  of  laches  may  preclude  recovery.  But  here,  there
seem to be two reasons why laches would not apply: (1) we
are  told  that  the  homeowner  made  a  “reasonable  and
prolonged  effort”  to  find  a  substitute,  suggesting  that  the
homeowner  spent  most  or  all  of  the  one-year  gap  between
repudiation and suit in reasonable efforts to mitigate, making
the gap not unjustifiable; and (2) there is no evidence that the
carpenter  has  been  prejudiced  by 
the  delay,  a  usual
requirement for laches.

(C)  is  wrong  as  a  statement  of  law:  When  a  plaintiff  suffers
from  the  defendant’s  anticipatory  repudiation,  all  standard
contract remedies are typically available to him, even though
the time for performance has not yet arrived. So a decree of
specific  performance  may  be  issued,  though  typically  the
decree would not require performance until the contractually-
specified time for it.

(D) is wrong as a statement of law. It is true that a decree of
specific performance, like other equitable relief, will not be
granted  where  damages  would  provide  an  adequate  remedy.
But  the  availability  of  nominal  damages  alone  will  typically
not be an adequate remedy, and that is certainly the case here,
where  the  homeowner’s  actual  damages  will  be  more  than
nominal.

II.   EXPECTATION DAMAGES

A.  Formula for calculating

1.  Breaching supplier of services

Question 47:  A  homeowner  and  a  contractor  entered  into  a
contract  for  the  construction  of  a  home  for  the  price  of
$300,000. The contractor was to earn a profit of $10,000 for
the job. After the contractor had spent $45,000 on labor and
materials, including $5,000 on oak flooring not yet installed,
the  homeowner  informed  the  contractor  that  the  homeowner
had  lost  his  job  and  could  not  pay  for  any  services.  The
homeowner  told  the  contractor  to  stop  working  immediately.

266

The  reasonable  market  value  of  the  labor  and  materials
provided  by  the  contractor  at  that  point,  including  the  oak
flooring, was $40,000. The contractor used the $5,000 worth
of oak flooring on another job.

In  an  action  by  the  contractor  against  the  homeowner  for
damages, which of the following would be the largest amount
of damages recoverable by the contractor?

(A)    $40,000,  the  reasonable  value  of  the  services  the

contractor had provided.

(B)  $40,000, the contractor’s construction costs.
(C)    $50,000,  the  contractor’s  construction  costs  of  $45,000
plus  the  $10,000  profit  minus  the  $5,000  saved  by
reusing the oak flooring on another job.

(D)    $55,000,  the  contractor’s  construction  costs  of  $45,000

plus the $10,000 profit.

Answer  47:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  $50,000  represents  the
contractor’s  expectation  measure  of  recovery  and  gives  the
contractor  the  benefit  of  the  bargain — this  amount  would
place the contractor in the position he would have been in but
for the breach. It is also the greatest amount the contractor is
able to recover. The general expectation formula permits the
contractor  to  recover  $50,000  and  can  be  computed  as
follows:

General expectation formula = Loss In Value + Other Loss –
Cost Avoided – Loss Avoided:

                            LIV =  the difference between the performance the non-breaching party should have received under the contract

and what was actually received, if anything, in this case, $300,000 less $0.

                            OL =   consequential and incidental damages, if any, in this case, $0.
                            CA =   the additional costs the non-breaching party can avoid by rightfully discontinuing performance under the

contract as a result of the other party’s breach, in this case, $290,000 less $45,000.

                                         (Full performance would have cost the contractor $290,000, since he would have made $10,000 on a
$300,000-revenue  contract.  But  the  contractor  has  already  incurred  $45,000  of  this  $290,000,
leaving $245,000.)

LA =   the beneficial effects of the breach due to the non-breaching party’s ability to salvage or reallocate resources
that otherwise would have been devoted to performing under the contract, in this case, $5,000 (the
oak flooring that can be reused).

So $300,000 + $0 – $245,000 – $5,000 = $50,000.
Rest. 2d, § 347; Farnsworth, § 12.9.

267

(A)  is  wrong,  because  it  does  not  put  the  contractor  in  the
position  he  would  have  been  in  had  the  contract  been
fulfilled.  The  $40,000  figure  is  an  attempt  to  calculate  the
contractor’s  restitution  recovery,  measured  by  the  benefit
conferred  on  the  owner.  See  Rest.  2d,  §  371.  That  measure
would  yield  the  smallest  amount  of  recovery,  since  it  would
not  allow  the  contractor  to  recover  damages  related  to  the
benefit  of  the  bargain.  “Innocent”  (i.e.,  non-breaching)
plaintiffs like the contractor usually have the option of suing
for  restitution  damages  where  this  would  produce  a  higher
recovery 
the  expectation  measure,  but  restitution
wouldn’t  produce  a  higher  recovery  here.  Furthermore,  the
$40,000  amount  is  incorrect  even  as  a  restitution  amount,
since  it  fails  to  deduct  the  $5,000  worth  of  oak  flooring  the
contractor  used  on  another  job  (making  the  real  benefit
conferred on the owner $35,000).

than 

represents 

fulfilled.  $40,000 

(B) is wrong because it, too (like the measure in (A)) fails to
put the contractor in the position he would have been in had
the  contract  been 
the
contractor’s reliance measure of recovery; that measure fails
to  take  into  account  the  contractor’s  benefit  of  the  bargain,
i.e.,  the  profit  the  contractor  anticipated  making  on  the
project.  Reliance  damages  would  consist  of  the  contractor’s
unreimbursed expenses for labor and materials, $45,000, less
the  salvage  value  of  the  oak  flooring,  $5,000,  which  indeed
equals $40,000, as this choice suggests. Cf. Rest. 2d, § 349.
But  nothing  in  this  scenario  would  cause  the  contractor  to
seek  damages  based  on  the  reliance  principle  and  forgo  his
(larger)  expectation  measure  of  recovery.  Rest.  2d,  §§  349,
347.
(D)  is  wrong  because  it’s  too  generous  to  the  contractor.  A
$55,000  damages  recovery  will  place  the  contractor  in  a
better position than he would have been in but for the breach,
because  it  fails  to  take  into  account  the  “loss  avoided”  (see
the discussion of Choice (C)) — the beneficial effects to the
contractor  from  the  breach,  due  to  the  contractor’s  ability  to
salvage  or  reallocate  resources  that  otherwise  would  have
been devoted to performing under the contract. Here the loss
avoided is the $5,000 worth of oak flooring that the contractor

268

used on another job.

Question 48: A contractor agreed to build a power plant for
a public utility. A subcontractor agreed with the contractor to
lay  the  foundation  for  $200,000.  The  subcontractor  supplied
goods and services worth $150,000, for which the contractor
made progress payments aggregating $100,000 as required by
the subcontract. The subcontractor then breached by refusing
unjustifiably  to  perform  further.  The  contractor  reasonably
spent $120,000 to have the work completed by a third party.

The subcontractor now sues the contractor for the reasonable
value of benefits conferred, and the contractor counterclaims
for breach of contract.

Which of the following should be the court’s decision?

(A) 

the  benefit
  The  subcontractor  recovers  $50,000, 
conferred  on  the  contractor  for  which  the  subcontractor
has not been paid.

(B)    The  subcontractor  recovers  $30,000,  the  benefit  the
subcontractor  conferred  on  the  contractor  minus  the
$20,000 in damages incurred by the contractor.

(C)    The  contractor  recovers  $20,000,  the  excess  over  the
contract  price  that  was  paid  by  the  contractor  for  the
performance  it  had  bargained  to  receive  from  the
subcontractor.
  Neither  party 
the
subcontractor  committed  a  material,  unexcused  breach
and  the  contractor  received  a  $50,000  benefit  from  the
subcontractor  for  which  the  subcontractor  has  not  been
paid.

recovers  anything,  because 

(D) 

Answer 48: Choice (C) is correct. The standard measure of
contract damages is the expectation measure, which attempts
to put the plaintiff in the position he would have been in had
the contract been performed. Here, performance meant that the
contractor  would  have  a  foundation,  at  a  total  cost  to  it  of
$200,000.  The  contractor  paid  the  subcontractor  $100,000,
then paid another $120,000 to the replacement subcontractor,
for  a  total  of  $220,000.  So  the  contractor  is  $20,000  worse
off than had the subcontractor performed. The contractor will
need to recover this $20,000 in order to be in the position that

269

performance would have left it.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  subcontractor’s  restitutionary
recovery must be computed after subtracting breach damages
owed  by  the  subcontractor.  A  materially-breaching  plaintiff
may recover in quasi-contract for the value to the defendant of
this  recovery  must  be
the  rendered  performance.  But 
computed on a “net” basis, by subtracting from the unpaid-for
value  rendered  to  the  defendant  any  damages  caused  by  the
breach.  So  in  this  case,  if  the  contractor  had  been  able  to
finish the work for, say, $10,000 (so that it would have spent
a  total  of  $130,000),  the  subcontractor  would  have  been
entitled  to  recover  in  quasi-contract  the  $50,000  difference
between the $150,000 value that it rendered to the contractor
and  the  $100,000  the  contractor  had  made  in  progress
payments  (since  the  subcontractor’s  breach  would  not  have
caused any damages to the contractor). But on the actual facts
here,  even  if  the  subcontractor  recovered  nothing  in  quasi-
contract,  the  contractor  would  still  have  been  damaged  by
$20,000  (as  analyzed  in  Choice  (C)).  So  the  subcontractor
obviously can’t recover anything in quasi-contract, since each
dollar  given  to  it  would  just  make  the  contractor’s  net
damages  worse. 
the
contractor the $20,000 needed to make the contractor whole.
Furthermore, in many jurisdictions a plaintiff who “wilfully”
breaches isn’t even eligible for a quasi-contract recovery, so
in  such  a  jurisdiction  we  wouldn’t  even  get  to  the  point  of
calculating whether the subcontractor was entitled to anything.

the  subcontractor  owes 

Instead, 

(B)  is  wrong  because  this  computation  would  not  leave  the
contractor  whole.  The  contractor  has  $20,000  in  damages
(see  Choice  (C))  only  on  the  assumption  that  the  contractor
doesn’t have to pay the subcontractor anything in the litigation
on  a  quasi-contract  theory.  If  the  subcontractor  recovered
$50,000,  the  contractor’s  net  damages  would  mount  to
$70,000 from the original $20,000.
(D) is wrong because this computation, too, would not leave
the  contractor  whole.  The  overriding  principle  is  that  the
contractor, 
counterclaimer,  gets
expectation damages to put it in the net position it would have
been in had the contract been performed. If the subcontractor

a  non-breaching 

as 

270

didn’t have to pay anything (and didn’t receive anything), the
contractor  would  be  $20,000  worse  off  than  if  the  contract
had been performed.

B.  “Reasonable certainty”

1.  Profits from a new business

a.  Not rule of law

i.  Shift in law

Question  49:  Swatter,  a  baseball  star,  contracted  with  the
Municipal Symphony Orchestra. Inc., to perform for $5,000 at
a  children’s  concert,  as  narrator  of  “Peter  and  the  Wolf.”
Shortly  before  the  concert,  Swatter  became  embroiled  in  a
highly publicized controversy over whether he had cursed and
assaulted a baseball fan. The orchestra canceled the contract
out of concern that attendance might be adversely affected by
Swatter’s appearance.
Swatter  sued  the  orchestra  for  breach  of  contract.  His
business  agent 
the
cancellation  had  resulted  in  Swatter’s  not  getting  other
contracts for performances and endorsements.
The trial court instructed the jury, in part, as follows: “If you
find  for  the  plaintiff,  you  may  award  damages  for  losses
which  at  the  time  of  contracting  could  reasonably  have  been
foreseen  by  the  defendant  as  a  probable  result  of  its  breach.
However,  the  law  does  not  permit  recovery  for  the  loss  of
prospective  profits  of  a  new  business  caused  by  breach  of
contract.”

testified  without  contradiction 

that 

On  Swatter’s  appeal  from  a  jury  verdict  for  Swatter,  and
judgment thereon, awarding damages only for the $5,000 fee
promised by the orchestra, the judgment will probably be
(A)  affirmed, because the trial court stated the law correctly.
(B)    affirmed,  because  the  issue  of  damages  for  breach  of

contract was solely a jury question.

(C)    reversed,  because  the  test  for  limiting  damages  is  what
the  breaching  party  could  reasonably  have  foreseen  at
the time of the breach.

(D)  reversed, because under the prevailing modern view, lost

271

profits  of  a  new  business  are  recoverable  if  they  are
established with reasonable certainty.

Answer 49:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  While  it  is  true  that  any
item of damages must be proved with reasonable certainty in
order  to  be  recovered,  there  is  no  fixed  rule  of  law  that
prospective  profits  from  a  new  business  may  not  be
recovered  in  a  breach  of  contract  action.  Since  the  judge’s
instructions  prevented  the  jury  from  even  considering  the
possibility that some elements of Swatter’s lost performance
and  endorsement  income  might  be  proven  with  reasonable
certainty, the instruction was incorrect and not harmless. (For
instance, Swatter might have been able to show that he got a
certain  amount  of  performance  or  endorsement  revenue  each
year  prior  to  Orchestra’s  cancellation,  and  that  this  dropped
to  $0  in  the  following  year  without  any  other  explanation;
such  proof,  if  made,  would  likely  have  satisfied  the
requirement of reasonable certainty.)
(A)  is  wrong  because  the  instruction  was  incorrect,  for  the
reason discussed in Choice (D) above.
(B) is wrong as a matter of law — although the jury computes
the  damages,  the  judge  can  and  must  instruct  the  jury  on  the
legal principles applicable to that computation (although here,
the judge did so incorrectly).

(C)  is  wrong  because,  while  it  is  true  that  contract  damages
are  generally  limited  to  those  which  the  defendant  could
reasonably  have  foreseen,  there  is  an  additional  requirement
that  each  item  of  damages  be  proved  with  reasonable
certainty,  and  this  choice  does  not  contain  that  important
additional limitation.

C.  Breaching seller of property

Question 50: On April 1, Owner and Buyer signed a writing
in  which  Owner,  “in  consideration  of  $100  to  be  paid  to
Owner  by  Buyer,”  offered  Buyer  the  right  to  purchase
Greenacre  for  $100,000  within  30  days.  The  writing  further
provided, “This offer will become effective as an option only
if and when the $100 consideration is in fact paid.” On April
received  no  payment  or  other
20,  Owner,  having 
communication from Buyer, sold and conveyed Greenacre to

272

Citizen  for  $120,000.  On  April  21,  Owner  received  a  letter
from  Buyer  enclosing  a  cashier’s  check  for  $100  payable  to
Owner  and  stating,  “I  am  hereby  exercising  my  option  to
purchase  Greenacre  and  am  prepared  to  close  whenever
you’re ready.” Owner explained that he had already sold the
property  to  Citizen.  Buyer  brought  suit  against  Owner  for
breach of contract.

Assume  that  Buyer  prevails  in  the  breach  of  contract  suit
against  Owner.  Which  of  the  following  is  Buyer  entitled  to
recover?

(A)    Nominal  damages  only,  because  the  remedy  of  specific

performance was not available to Buyer.

(B)  The fair market value, if any, of an assignable option to

purchase Greenacre for $100,000.

(C)  $20,000, plus the amount, if any, by which the fair market
value  of  Greenacre  on  the  date  of  Owner’s  breach
exceeded $120,000.

(D)    The  amount,  if  any,  by  which  the  fair  market  value  of
Greenacre  on  the  date  of  Owner’s  breach  exceeded
$100,000.

Answer  50:  Choice  (D)  is  correct,  because  it  correctly
reflects  the  standard  measure  of  damages  for  breach:
expectation  damages.  In  awarding  expectation  damages,  the
court  attempts  to  put  the  plaintiff  in  the  position  she  would
have  been  in  had  the  contract  been  performed  by  the
defendant. Normally, this means that the plaintiff is awarded
the  profits  she  would  have  made  had  the  contract  been
performed.  That’s  the  case  here.  Choice  (D)  best  states  this
principle:  In  giving  Buyer  “the  amount,  if  any,  by  which  the
fair  market  value  of  Greenacre  on  the  date  of  [the]  breach
exceeded [the contract price],” the court will be giving Buyer
the  “benefit  of  her  bargain,”  i.e.,  the  profit  she  would  have
been able to make immediately by reselling the property.
(A) is wrong because nominal damages — which are a small
sum that is fixed without regard to the amount of harm — are
awarded only when a right of action for breach exists but no
harm has been done or is provable. Here, Buyer has suffered
provable harm (the contract-market differential). The fact that

273

an equitable remedy (injunction) isn’t available doesn’t mean
that  Buyer  didn’t  suffer  provable  harm,  and  doesn’t  prevent
Buyer from collecting expectation damages.

(B) is wrong because the value of an assignable option would
not be a measure of Buyer’s expectation interest in this case.
When Buyer sent the $100, she was exercising the option, and
thus  binding  herself  to  purchase  the  property.  Prior  to  that
moment, it’s possible that the measure of damages would  be
the  value  of  the  option  (less  the  $100  price  to  “buy”  that
option).  But  once  Buyer  exercised  by  sending  the  $100,  the
option was no longer significant — there was a contract fully
binding on both sides, and the usual measure of damages for a
buyer  whose  seller  breaches  the  contract  of  sale  (benefit  of
the bargain) applied.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  incorrectly  implies  that  the  market
value on the day of the sale to Citizen was at least $120,000.
If  the  sale  price  to  Citizen  were  the  definitive  proof  of  the
market value of the property, this choice might be an accurate
formulation.  But  that  sale  price  is  not  legally  dispositive,
merely  evidence  of  the  fair  market  value.  For  instance,  the
sale to Citizen might have been at a price that the court finds
to be greater than the actual market value on that day. In that
event,  guaranteeing  Buyer  a  minimum  recovery  of  $20,000
would  be  legally  incorrect.  (True,  it  seems  unlikely  that
anyone would pay greater than the then “fair market value” on
the day of sale. But the point is that the legal standard is “fair
market value less plaintiff’s contract price,” not “the lesser of
(1)  the  price  paid  by  the  third  party  minus  the  plaintiff’s
contract price or (2) the fair market value minus the plaintiff’s
contract price.”)

III.  SUITS IN QUASI-CONTRACT

A.  Breaching plaintiff

1.  Construction cases

a.  Lesser of “cost to owner” and “change in value to owner”

Question 51: In a single writing, a painter contracted with a
farmer  to  paint  three  identical  barns  on  the  farmer’s  rural

274

estate for $2,000 each. The contract provided for the farmer’s
payment of $6,000 upon the painter’s completion of the work
on  all  three  barns.  The  painter  did  not  ask  for  any  payment
when the first barn was completely painted, but she demanded
$4,000  after  painting  the  second  barn.  The  farmer  rightfully
refused  the  painter’s  demand  for  payment.  The  painter  then
immediately terminated the contract without painting the third
barn. What is the painter entitled to recover from the farmer?

(A)  Nothing, because payment was expressly conditioned on

completion of all three barns.

(B)    The  painter’s  expenditures  plus  anticipated  “profit”  in
painting the first two barns, up to a maximum recovery of
$4,000.

(C)  The reasonable value of the painter’s services in painting
the two barns, less the farmer’s damages, if any, for the
painter’s failure to paint the third barn.

(D)    The  amount  that  the  combined  value  of  the  two  painted

barns has been increased by the painter’s work.

Answer  51:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Where  a  defaulting
plaintiff  has  rendered  some  performance  of  value  to  the
defendant,  but  has  not  substantially  performed,  the  plaintiff
may not recover “on the contract.” But she may recover on a
quasi-contract  or  quantum  meruit  (“as  much  as  he
deserved”) theory — the court uses its equity-like powers to
prevent unjust enrichment of the defendant. If the farmer didn’t
have to pay anything, he’d be unjustly enriched (at least with
respect  to  the  two  painted  barns,  putting  aside  his  damage
from not getting the agreed-upon painting of the third barn) by
the “value” to him of the painting of two barns. So the court
would  start  by  awarding  the  painter  this  value.  But  then,  the
farmer would be entitled to be made whole for the damages to
him  from  not  getting  all  three  barns  painted  for  the  agreed-
upon $6,000. So the court would compute how much it would
now cost the farmer to get that single barn painted. If that cost
would  be  $2,000  or  less,  the  farmer’s  damages  would  be
zero. But if it would cost more, then the difference would be
deducted  from  the  painter’s  quasi-contract  “value  of  the
services of painting two barns” recovery.
(A)  is  wrong  because  even  though  the  painting  of  all  three

275

barns was an express condition of payment under the contract,
the court can and would still award a quasi-contract recovery,
as described above.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  painter  is  only  entitled  to  a  quasi-
contract  recovery,  not  to  recover  “on  the  contract.”  So  any
formula  keyed  to  the  painter’s  anticipated  “profit”  is
irrelevant — it’s the value to the defendant, not the profit that
would  have  been  made  by  the  breaching  plaintiff,  that  is  the
starting  point.  (Profits  that  would  have  been  made  by  the
plaintiff  are  relevant  only  where  it’s  the  defendant,  not  the
plaintiff, who breached.)

(D)  is  wrong  because  this  formula  doesn’t  take  into  account
the farmer’s right to deduct damages for the painter’s failure
to  paint  the  third  barn.  (The  court  might  indeed  use  the
increase in the value of the two painted barns as the measure
of  the  “reasonable  value”  of  the  painter’s  services,  but  the
court  would  deduct  from  this  number  the  farmer’s  damages
from the failure to paint the third barn.)

2.  UCC gives partial restitution to breaching buyer

a.  Exception for actual damages proved by seller

Question 52: Hydro-King. Inc., a high-volume, pleasure-boat
retailer, entered into a written contract with Zuma, signed by
both  parties,  to  sell  Zuma  a  power  boat  for  $12,000.  The
manufacturer’s price of the boat delivered to Hydro-King was
$9,500.  As  the  contract  provided,  Zuma  paid  Hydro-King
$4,000 in advance and promised to pay the full balance upon
delivery of the boat. The contract contained no provision for
liquidated  damages.  Prior  to  the  agreed  delivery  date,  Zuma
notified  Hydro-King  that  he  would  be  financially  unable  to
conclude the purchase; and Hydro-King thereupon resold the
same  boat  that  Zuma  had  ordered  to  a  third  person  for
$12,000 cash.
If Zuma sues Hydro-King for restitution of the $4,000 advance
payment, which of the following should the court decide?
(A)  Zuma’s claim should be denied, because, as the party in
default, he is deemed to have lost any right to restitution
of a benefit conferred on Hydro-King.

276

(B)    Zuma’s  claim  should  be  denied,  because,  but  for  his
repudiation,  Hydro-King  would  have  made  a  profit  on
two boat-sales instead of one.

(C)  Zuma’s claim should be upheld in the amount of $4,000
minus  the  amount  of  Hydro-King’s  lost  profit  under  its
contract with Zuma.

(D)  Zuma’s claims should be upheld in the amount of $3,500
($4,000  minus  $500  as  statutory  damages  under  the
UCC).

Answer  52:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  UCC  controls.
Section  2-718  deals  with  a  repudiating  buyer’s  right  to
restitution of any deposit. Section 2-718(2) states the general
rule  that  if  there  is  no  liquidated  damages  clause  in  the
contract (and there is none here), the seller must return all but
20% of the total contract price or $500, whichever amount is
smaller.  However,  §  2-718(3)  says  that  the  buyer’s  right  to
restitution  is  subject  “to  offset  to  the  extent  that  the  seller
establishes  (a)  a  right  to  recover  damages  under  the
provisions of this Article other than [the liquidated damages
provision].” So to the extent that Hydro-King can prove actual
damages greater than $500, it need refund only the amount of
the deposit less these greater actual damages. That’s precisely
the  formulation  listed  in  Choice  (C).  (We  don’t  know  what
Hydro-King’s lost profits actually will be, because we don’t
know whether it is a “lost volume” seller, or instead can only
get fewer of the power boats in question than it has customers
for, in which case it would not have suffered any actual lost
profits. But whatever amount represents its actual lost profits,
Hydro-King  gets  to  keep  that  amount,  as  this  choice
specifies.)
(A)  is  wrong  because  it  directly  conflicts  with  §  2-718(2),
which  entitles  even  a  defaulting  buyer  to  restitution  of  his
deposit less either the seller’s actual damages or the lesser of
20% of the contract price and $500.
(B)  is  wrong  for  two  reasons:  (1)  we  don’t  actually  know
whether Hydro-King is indeed a “lost volume seller” as this
choice  suggests  it  is — if  Hydro-King  had  more  customers
wanting  to  buy  that  particular  model  boat  than  it  could  get
boats  from  the  manufacturer,  Hydro-King  didn’t  lose  a  net

277

sale; and (2) even if Hydro-King lost a net sale, its damages
were  only  $2,500,  so  it  can’t  keep  the  entire  $4,000  as  this
choice asserts it can.

(D) is wrong because, while it correctly states the result that
would occur under § 2-718(2) if Hydro-King couldn’t prove
any  actual  damages,  it  ignores  the  fact  that  Hydro-King  can
keep  that  part  of  the  deposit  representing  its  actual  damages
from the lost sale if this amount is greater than $500.

IV.  LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

A.  Reasonableness of amount

1.  Modern view

a.  Unexpectedly high damages

i.  How tested on the MBE

Question 53: A sea captain owns an exceptionally seaworthy
boat  that  she  charters  for  sport  fishing  at  a  $500  daily  rate.
The fee includes the use of the boat with the sea captain as the
captain, and one other crew member, as well as fishing tackle
and  bait.  On  May  1,  a  customer  agreed  with  the  captain  that
the customer would have the full-day use of the boat on May
15 for himself and his family for $500. The customer paid an
advance  deposit  of  $200  and  signed  an  agreement  that  the
deposit  could  be  retained  by  the  captain  as  liquidated
damages  in  the  event  the  customer  canceled  or  failed  to
appear.

At the time of contracting, the captain told the customer to be
at the dock at 5 a.m. on May 15. The customer and his family,
however,  did  not  show  up  on  May  15  until  noon.  Meantime,
the captain agreed at 10 a.m. to take a replacement customer
and  her  family  out  fishing  for  the  rest  of  the  day.  The
replacement  had  happened  to  come  by  and  inquire  about  the
possibility  of  such  an  outing.  In  view  of  the  late  hour,  the
captain  charged  the  replacement  $400  and  stayed  out  two
hours  beyond  the  customary  return  time.  The  original
customer’s failure to appear until noon was due to the fact that
he had been trying to charter another boat across the bay at a
lower  rate  and  had  gotten  lost  after  he  was  unsuccessful  in

278

getting such a charter.

Which  of  the  following  is  an  accurate  statement  concerning
the rights of the parties?

(A)    The  captain  can  retain  the  $200  paid  by  the  customer,
because it would be difficult for the captain to establish
her actual damages and the sum appears to have been a
reasonable forecast in light of anticipated loss of profit
from the charter.

(B)    The  captain  is  entitled  to  retain  only  $50  (10%  of  the
contract price) and must return $150 to the customer.
(C)  The captain must return $100 to the customer in order to
avoid  her  own  unjust  enrichment  at  the  customer’s
expense.

(D)  The captain must return $100 to the customer, because the
liquidated-damage clause under the circumstances would
operate as a penalty.

Answer 53: Choice (A) is correct. Even in a court that has a
relatively  tough  standard  for  the  enforceability  of  litigated
damages clauses, the court will enforce the clause if both of
the  following  are  true:  (1)  the  forecast  was  a  reasonable
estimate  of  likely  damages  at  the  time  the  contract  was
entered  into;  and  (2)  the  party  seeking  to  enforce  the  clause
has  suffered  actual  damages  that  are  hard  to  calculate
accurately. Here, these two conditions are satisfied: (1) at the
time the contract was made, the captain faced a real risk that
the customer would fail to show up at the last minute, and that
she would be unable to get another charter for that same day;
therefore,  a  deposit  of  40%  of  total  contract  price  was  a
reasonable forecast of likely damages, especially since most
of the captain’s costs for a one-day charter are fixed (cost of
boat) so that if she doesn’t do the trip she recoups relatively
little expense; (2) while the captain has collected $400 from
the replacement as well as $200 from the customer, giving her
a  total  for  the  day  of  $600  (i.e.,  $100  more  than  she  would
have gotten from the customer alone if the contract had been
fulfilled), she had to stay out two hours beyond the customary
return time, so some of her $100 “surplus” may have been due
to 
than  being  a  windfall;
consequently, the captain’s actual damages are indeed hard to

this  extra-long  day  rather 

279

calculate accurately after-the-fact.

(B) is wrong because it is a misstatement of law. In non-sales
cases,  there  is  no  single  formula  that  determines  the  outer
bounds  of  permissible  liquidated  damages,  as  this  choice
suggests that there is. The examiners may have been trying to
trick  you  into  thinking  of  the  formula  applied  in  UCC  cases,
under  which  if  the  buyer  of  goods  makes  a  deposit  and  then
breaches  (e.g.,  by  canceling),  and  the  contract  does  not
contain a liquidated damages clause, the buyer gets back any
part of his deposit in excess of “20% of the value of the total
[contract  price]  or  $500,  whichever  is  smaller”  if  the  seller
does  not  establish  actual  damages.  §  2-718(2)(b).  Since  this
is  a  contract  for  the  sale  of  services  rather  than  goods,  this
provision does not apply (and the 10% amount in the choice
doesn’t match up with the UCC percentage anyway).

(C) is wrong because, while it arguably describes a treatment
that puts the captain in the same position she would have been
in  had  the  contract  been  performed  (she  has  collected  $600
for  the  day  from  the  combination  of  the  customer  and  the
replacement,  versus  $500  if  the  customer  contract  had  been
performed,  so  she  arguably  needs  to  give  back  $100),  this
choice ignores the liquidated damages clause. So long as the
liquidated  damages  clause  meets  the  rules  for  enforceability
of such clauses, the fact that the clause gives the person trying
to  use  it  some  slight  benefit  over  the  actual  damage  amount
that a court might compute is irrelevant.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  liquidated  damages  clause  here
would  not  operate  as  a  penalty.  As  long  as  such  a  clause  at
least  meets  the  two-part  test  described  in  Choice  (A),  it  by
definition  does  not  constitute  a  penalty.  In  other  words,  the
“penalty”  label  is  simply  a  shorthand  method  of  stating  that
the  clause  doesn’t  pass  the  two-part  test,  which  the  clause
here does pass.

V.  DAMAGES IN SALES CONTRACTS

A.  Where goods not accepted

1.  Seller’s damages for breach

280

a.  Lost profits

i.  “Lost volume” seller

Question  54:  By  the  terms  of  a  written  contract  signed  by
both parties on January 15, a computer retailer agreed to sell
a specific ICB personal computer to a buyer for $3,000, and
the  buyer  agreed  to  pick  up  and  pay  for  the  computer  at  the
retailer’s  store  on  February  1.  The  buyer  unjustifiably
repudiated  on  February  1.  Without  notifying  the  buyer,  the
retailer  subsequently  sold  at  private  sale  the  same  specific
computer to another buyer, who paid the same price ($3,000)
in  cash.  The  ICB  is  a  popular  product;  the  retailer  can  buy
from the manufacturer more units than it can sell at retail.

If the retailer sues the buyer for breach of contract, the retailer
will probably recover

(A)  nothing, because it received a price on resale equal to the

contract price that the buyer had agreed to pay.

(B)    nothing,  because  the  retailer  failed  to  give  the  buyer

proper notice of the retailer’s intention to resell.

(D) 

the  buyer

(C)    the  retailer’s  anticipated  profit  on  the  sale  to  the  buyer
plus incidental damages, if any, because the retailer lost
that sale.
  $3,000  (the  contract  price),  because 
intentionally breached the contract by repudiation.
Answer  54:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  retailer  is  a  “lost
volume”  seller,  that  is,  one  who  can  obtain  as  many  items
from  a  supplier  as  she  can  sell.  UCC  §  2-708(2),  which
doesn’t expressly mention lost-volume sellers but is designed
for  them,  gives  such  sellers  the  profit  that  the  seller  would
have made from full performance by the buyer, together with
any incidental damages.
(A)  is  wrong  because  §  2-708(2)  gives  a  lost-volume  seller
such as the retailer its lost profits regardless of the amount of
the  resale-contract  differential.  Indeed,  the  whole  point  of  §
2-708(2) is to prevent a lost-volume seller from being limited
to a $0 or very small resale-contract differential.
(B) is wrong because notice of intent to resell is not required
where the recovery is on a lost-volume basis. When the seller

281

elects  the  remedy  of  “cover” — i.e.,  the  right  to  resell  and
collect  the  difference  between  the  resale  price  and  the
(higher) contract price — and the resale is at  a  private  sale,
the  buyer  “reasonable
to  give 
the  seller  is  required 
notification of his intention to resell.” § 2-706(3). However,
the  retailer  is  not  recovering  on  this  resale/contract-price
basis  (since  that  basis  would  give  him  $0).  Instead,  he’s
recovering his lost profits as a lost-volume seller under § 2-
708(2),  and  no  advance  notice  is  required  for  such  a
recovery.

(D) is wrong because the damages available to a lost volume
seller are not the contract price. The retailer is entitled to its
lost  profits  and  any  incidental  damages  suffered.  Awarding
the retailer the contract price would over-compensate it, since
it has not had to bear the expense of buying the computer from
the manufacturer.

CHAPTER 10
CONTRACTS INVOLVING MORE THAN
TWO PARTIES

I.    ASSIGNMENT

A.  Contract terms prohibiting assignment

Question 55: In a written contract, a seller agreed to deliver
to a buyer 500 described chairs at $20 each, F.O.B. seller’s
place  of  business.  The  contract  provided  that  “neither  party
will  assign  this  contract  without  the  written  consent  of  the
other.”  The  seller  placed  the  chairs  on  board  a  carrier  on
January 30. On February 1, the seller said in a signed writing,
“I  hereby  assign  to  my  bank  all  my  rights  under  the  seller-
buyer contract.” The seller did not request and did not get the
buyer’s consent to this transaction. On February 2, the chairs
while  in  transit  were  destroyed  in  a  derailment  of  the
carrier’s railroad car.

In an action by the bank against the buyer, the bank probably
will recover

(A)  $10,000, the contract price.
(B)  the difference between the contract price and the market

value of the chairs.

(C)  nothing, because the chairs had not been delivered.
(D)    nothing,  because  the  seller-buyer  contract  forbade  an

assignment.

Answer  55:  The  correct  choice  is  (A)  because  it  correctly
identifies  that  the  bank  will  be  able  to  recover  the  entire
contract  amount.  Arriving  at  this  result  requires  resolving
three  major  issues:  (1)  whether  the  assignment  to  the  bank
was valid, (2) whether the risk of loss had passed to the buyer
by the moment of destruction; and (3) the measure of damages
in these circumstances.

First,  the  assignment  was  valid,  even  though  the  contract
expressly  prohibited  assignment  without  the  other  party’s
there  are  no
permission.  Under  UCC  §  2-210(4), 

if 

283

circumstances indicating the contrary, a provision prohibiting
assignment  “of  the  contract”  is  deemed  to  bar  only  the
delegation of duties, not the assignment of contractual rights.
(Furthermore,  under  UCC  §  9-406,  the  right  to  receive
payment  cannot  be  prohibited  from  assignment — so  even  if
the circumstances had  indicated  a  contrary  intent,  the  clause
barring  assignment  would  not  have  prevented  the  seller’s
assignment  of  his  right  to  payment.)  So  the  seller  was
permitted  to  make — and  did  make — an  assignment  to  the
bank of all his rights (i.e., the right to payment). (The bank as
assignee would still be subject to any defenses that the buyer
would have had against the seller, but as discussed in the next
paragraph, there are no such defenses, because the risk of loss
passed to the bank.)

Second,  the  risk  of  loss  had  passed  to  the  buyer  by  the
moment of destruction, because of the “F.O.B. seller’s place
of business” term. Under that term, the risk of loss passed to
the buyer as soon as the seller placed the chairs on board the
carrier.  Since  the  chairs  were  destroyed  after  the  seller  did
so,  while  the  chairs  were  in  transit,  the  buyer  will  bear  the
loss.  Therefore,  the  bank,  as  assignee  of  the  seller’s  rights,
gets to collect the purchase price just as the seller would have
been entitled to do had he not made the assignment. (Note that
the seller and the buyer could have distributed the loss as they
saw  fit — if 
they  provided  “F.O.B.  buyer’s  place  of
business,”  the  seller  would  have  borne  the  risk  of  loss  until
the goods had arrived at the buyer’s business).

Third,  you  have  to  figure  out  what  the  measure  of  damages
would be. The bank steps into the seller’s shoes, because the
assignment  was  valid  and  the  seller  complied  with  all
contractual obligations. UCC § 2-709(1) says that “when the
buyer fails to pay the price as it becomes due the seller may
recover,  together  with  any  incidental  damages  .  .  .  (a)  the
[contract]  price  of  .  .  .  conforming  goods  lost  or  damaged
within a commercially reasonable time after risk of their loss
has passed to the buyer[.]” So had there been no assignment,
the seller would have been entitled to the full contract price.
The  bank,  standing  in  the  shoes  of  the  seller,  is  entitled  to
receive this same amount.

284

(B)  is  wrong,  because  it  does  not  use  the  correct  formula  in
determining  the  bank’s  damages.  The  bank  steps  into  the
seller’s  shoes,  because  the  assignment  was  valid  and  the
seller  complied  with  all  contractual  obligations.  (Both  of
these propositions are further explained above.) As explained
in the last paragraph of the discussion of Choice (A), the bank
is  entitled  to  recover  the  full  contract  price.  Choice  (B),  by
restricting the bank to the contract/market differential, would
leave  the  bank  woefully  undercompensated:  For  instance,  if
as would likely be the case the contract price was equal to the
market price, the differential would leave the bank (standing
in  the  seller’s  shoes)  with  $0  recovery,  yet  the  buyer  would
be  deemed  to  have  received  and  accepted  (by  virtue  of  the
F.O.B. clause) conforming goods.

(C) is wrong, because it fails to recognize that the buyer will
be  liable  even  though  the  chairs  hadn’t  been  delivered.
Determining  who’s  responsible  for  the  loss — the  seller  or
the buyer —  depends on determining whether the risk of loss
had passed from the seller to the buyer. The relevant term is
the F.O.B. term — here, that term specifies the seller’s place
of business. Thus, once the seller placed the goods on board
the  carrier,  the  risk  of  loss  passed  to  the  buyer.  In  other
words,  the  goods  are  deemed  to  have  been  delivered,  even
though they never got to the buyer’s place of business.
If  the  term  had  been  “F.O.B.  buyer’s  place  of  business,”
choice C would be right, because the buyer wouldn’t bear the
risk of loss until the chairs reached him.

(D) is wrong because it doesn’t recognize that the seller had
the  right  to  assign  his  rights  under  the  contract  despite  the
contract  prohibition.  Here,  it’s  true  that  the  seller  and  the
buyer agreed not to “assign the contract” without the written
consent of the other party. But under UCC § 2-210(4), absent
circumstances indicating the contrary, a provision prohibiting
assignment  “of  the  contract”  is  deemed  to  bar  only  the
delegation of duties, not the assignment of contractual rights.
So  the  seller  was  permitted  to  make  (and  did  make)  an
assignment  to  the  bank  of  all  his  rights  (i.e.,  the  right  to
payment).  (Furthermore,  under  UCC  §  9-406,  the  right  to
receive  payment  cannot  be  prohibited  from  assignment — so

285

even if the circumstances had indicated a contrary intent, the
clause  barring  assignment  would  not  have  prevented  the
seller’s assignment of his right to payment.)

B.  Assignee vs. obligor

Question  56:  Under  the  terms  of  a  written  contract,  a
contractor agreed to construct for a homeowner a garage for
$10,000.  Nothing  was  said  in  the  parties’  negotiations  or  in
the contract about progress payments during the course of the
work. After completing 25% of the garage strictly according
to the homeowner’s specifications, the contractor assigned his
rights under the contract to a banker as security for an $8,000
loan. The banker immediately notified the homeowner of the
assignment.  The  contractor  thereafter,  without  legal  excuse,
it  was  half-complete.  The
abandoned 
contractor subsequently defaulted on the loan from the banker.
The  contractor  has  no  assets.  It  will  cost  the  homeowner  at
least $8,000 to get the garage finished by another builder.

job  before 

the 

If  the  banker  sues  the  homeowner  for  $8,000,  which  of  the
following will the court decide?

(A)    The  banker  wins,  because  the  contractor-homeowner
contract  was  in  existence  and  the  contractor  was  not  in
breach  when  the  banker  gave  the  homeowner  notice  of
the assignment.

(B)    The  banker  wins,  because  the  banker  as  a  secured
creditor  over  the  contractor  is  entitled  to  priority  over
the homeowner’s unsecured claim against the contractor.
(C)  The homeowner wins, because his right to recoupment on
account  of  the  contractor’s  breach  is  available  against
the banker as the contractor’s assignee.

(D)    The  homeowner  wins,  because  his  claim  against  the
contractor  arose  prior  to  the  contractor’s  default  on  his
loan from the banker.

Answer  56:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Generally,  an  assignee
“stands  in  the  shoes  of  his  assignor.”  That  is,  the  assignee
generally 
to  all  defenses,  set-offs,  and
counterclaims that the obligor could have asserted against the
assignor.  Here,  therefore,  the  banker  as  assignee  of  the
contractor’s  rights  stands  in  the  contractor’s  shoes,  and  is

takes  subject 

286

vulnerable  to  any  counterclaim  or  defense  to  which  the
contractor  would  have  been  vulnerable  if  it  was  the
contractor that was suing the homeowner. If the contractor had
not made the assignment and had sued the homeowner for the
$10,000  contract  price  (or  any  part  of  it),  the  homeowner
could  have  raised  the  counterclaim  or  defense  for  damages
for breach due to the contractor’s abandonment, and used that
counterclaim/defense  as  a  set-off,  i.e.,  to  reduce  any  amount
which  the  homeowner  would  otherwise  owe.  Consequently,
the  homeowner  can  make  this  same  counterclaim  or  defense
when  sued  by  the  banker  as  the  contractor’s  assignee.  (The
homeowner could not achieve an affirmative recovery against
the banker, but the homeowner isn’t trying to do that here, just
reduce the amount he owes the banker.)

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  does  not  matter  either  that  the
contractor-homeowner  contract  was  already  in  existence  at
the time of the notice of assignment or that the contractor was
not yet in breach at that time. In a suit by the assignee against
the  obligor, 
the  obligor  can  raise  any  defenses  or
counterclaims  that  it  could  have  raised  against  the  assignor,
regardless of when those defenses or counterclaims came into
existence.  (If  you  selected  this  choice,  you  may  have  been
thinking  about  the  rules  on  modification,  under  which  the
giving of notice of assignment by the assignee to the obligor
will deprive the obligor and assignor of the subsequent right
to modify the contract if the assignor has fully performed.)

(B) is wrong because it states a completely fictitious rule of
law.  It  is  true  that  the  homeowner’s  claim  is  unsecured  and
that  the  banker’s  is  secured;  this  fact  might  prevent  the
homeowner  from  getting  and  collecting  an  affirmative
recovery  against  the  contractor  (since  the  banker’s  secured
claim  would  take  priority  over  the  homeowner’s  later-
acquired judgment for the affirmative recovery). But what the
homeowner  cares  about  here  is  using  its  claim  as  a  set-off
(something  that  can  reduce  the  banker’s  recovery  against  the
homeowner), and the homeowner’s claim is fully operative as
a  set-off  even  though  the  set-off  claim  is  in  a  sense
“unsecured.”
(D)  is  wrong  because,  while  it  states  the  correct  result,  it

287

gives  the  wrong  reason.  Whether  or  not  the  homeowner’s
claim  against  the  contractor  arose  prior  to  the  contractor’s
default  on  the  loan  from  the  banker,  the  homeowner  gets  to
raise against the banker any defense he could use against the
contractor (for reasons described in the discussion of Choice
(C) above).

Question  57:  On  March  1,  Mechanic  agreed  to  repair
Ohner’s machine for $5,000, to be paid on completion of the
work.  On  March  15,  before  the  work  was  completed,
Mechanic sent a letter to Ohner with a copy to Jones, telling
Ohner to pay the $5,000 to Jones, who was one of Mechanic’s
creditors. Mechanic then completed the work.

Which of the following, if true, would best serve Ohner as a
defense in an action brought against him by Jones for $5,000?

(A)  Jones was incapable of performing Mechanic’s work.
(B)  Mechanic had not performed his work in a workmanlike

manner.

(C)  On March 1, Mechanic had promised Ohner that he would

not assign the contract.

(D)    Jones  was  not  the  intended  beneficiary  of  the  Ohner-

Mechanic contract.

Answer  57:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  An  assignment  of
contractual  rights  is  the  transfer  of  that  right  to  another.  It
requires  assignor’s  intent  to  transfer,  identification  of  the
rights  to  be  assigned,  and  assignee’s  acceptance  (which  is
normally presumed if the assignment is beneficial). Under the
contract here, Mechanic’s “right” under  the  contract  was  to
receive  payment  from  Ohner.  Thus,  his  letter  to  Jones  and
Ohner  would  serve  to  transfer  the  right  to  payment  to  Jones.
This  makes  Jones  the  assignee,  Mechanic  the  assignor,  and
Ohner  the  obligor.  The  result  of  the  transfer  is  that  Jones
“stands in Mechanic’s shoes” as to the right to payment. As a
result, any defenses under the contract that Ohner could assert
against  Mechanic,  he  can  assert  against  Jones.  Thus,
Mechanic’s failure to perform under the contract would be a
defense Ohner could successfully assert against Jones.
(A)  is  not  the  best  response,  because  Jones’s  ability  to  do
Mechanic’s  work  is  irrelevant  to  Jones’s  recovery.  If  you

288

chose  this  response,  you  either  confused  an  assignment  of
rights with a delegation of duties, or assumed that Mechanic
assigned  the  contract,  not  just  the  right  to  payment,  which
would  involve  a  presumption  that  the  duties  were  delegated
as  well.  Most  “impersonal”  duties  can  be  delegated,  and
Mechanic’s  duty  to  repair  the  machine  probably  could  be
delegated, barring facts indicating that Ohner had a particular
interest in receiving performance from Mechanic. Rest. 2d §
318(2). However, a delegation or an assignment is not valid
where  it  materially  increases  the  risk  that  Ohner  will  not
receive return performance. Rest. 2d § 317 (2). Where Jones
can’t perform the work, such a delegation would be invalid.
However,  since  only  an  assignment  of  right  to  payment  is
involved here, A isn’t the best response.

(C)  is  not  the  best  response,  because  the  prohibition  against
assignment  would  not  be  upheld.  UCC  §  9-406(d)  provides
that  a  party  may  assign  its  right  to  payment  even  though  the
contract  under  which  payment  is  due  prohibits  assignment.
Here, the proposed answer stipulates that Mechanic promised
not to assign the contract. Nonetheless, applicable law would
permit  Mechanic  to  assign  the  right  to  collect  Ohner’s
payment.
(D) is not the best response, because Jones’s not being a third
party beneficiary would not be determinative of his recovery.
This choice suggests that the only way Jones can recover is as
an intended beneficiary to the contract. While it’s true that an
intended beneficiary has enforceable  rights  under  a  contract,
so does an assignee.

Question  58:  A  tortfeasor  tortiously  injured  a  victim  in  an
the  victim  was  consequently
auto  accident.  While 
hospitalized, the tortfeasor’s liability insurer settled with the
victim  for  $5,000.  The  victim  gave  the  insurer  a  signed
release  and  received  a  signed  memorandum  wherein  the
insurer promised to pay the victim $5,000 by check within 30
days.  When  the  victim  left  the  hospital  two  days  later,  the
hospital  demanded  payment  of  his  $4,000  stated  bill.  The
victim  thereupon  gave  the  hospital  his  own  negotiable
promissory note for $4,000 payable to the hospital’s order in

289

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

30  days,  and  also,  as  security,  assigned  to  the  hospital  the
insurer’s  settlement  memorandum.  The  hospital  promptly
assigned for value the settlement memorandum and negotiated
the  note  to  a  bank,  which  took  the  note  as  a  holder  in  due
course. Subsequently, the victim misrepresented to the insurer
that  he  had  lost  the  settlement  memorandum  and  needed
another. The insurer issued another memorandum identical to
the first, and the victim assigned it to a furniture company to
secure  a  $5,000  credit  sale  contract.  The  furniture  company
immediately  notified  the  insurer  of  this  assignment.  Later  it
was  discovered  that  the  hospital  had  mistakenly  overbilled
the victim by an amount of $1,000 and that the tortfeasor was
an irresponsible minor.

In view of the tortfeasor’s age and irresponsibility when the
insurer  issued  his  liability  policy,  can  the  bank  and  the
furniture company recover on their assignments?

(A)  Neither can recover because the victim, the assignor, is a
third-party  beneficiary  of  the  liability  policy  whose
rights thereon can be no better than the tortfeasor’s.
(B)  Neither can recover unless the insurer knowingly waived
and

tortfeasor’s  minority 

the 

the  defense  of 
irresponsibility.

(C)    Neither  can  recover  because  the  liability  policy  and
settlement  thereunder  are  unenforceable  on  account  of
the tortfeasor’s minority.

(D)    Either  the  bank  or  the  furniture  company,  depending  on
priority, can recover as an assignee (or subassignee) on
the victim’s claim, because the victim’s claim arose from
the  insurer’s  settlement  agreement,  and  that  settlement
was valid.

Answer 58:  Choice  (D)  is  correct,  because  it  identifies  the
central reason why the insurer will be liable to the bank or the
furniture company, whichever assignee has priority. The rights
of  either  the  bank  or  the  furniture  company  stem  from  the
victim-insurer  settlement  agreement.  In  order  to  be  valid,  a
contract  requires  consideration,  which  is  a  bargained-for
exchange and either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to
the  promisee  (and  typically  both).  Under  these  facts,  the
victim  had  a  good-faith  belief  in  the  validity  of  his  claim

290

against  the  insurer.  Thus,  the  settlement  agreement  between
them,  whereby  the  victim  surrendered  his  claim,  was
supported  by  consideration.  Since  the  insurer’s  settlement
promise (to pay the victim $5,000) was not conditional on the
tortfeasor’s policy’s being valid as against the insurer, the fact
that  the  insurer  might  have  had  a  chance  to  void  the  policy
pre-settlement on the grounds of the tortfeasor’s minority (an
unlikely chance anyway) is irrelevant, and the settlement was
binding on the insurer.

Then,  because  the  right  to  receive  payment  was  assignable,
the victim validly assigned his right to either the bank or the
furniture  company  (depending  on  which  had  priority).  As
assignee,  the  bank  or  the  furniture  company  assumed  the
victim’s  rights  under  the  contract,  and  could  enforce  the
insurer’s promise to pay.

the  settlement  agreement  between 

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  victim’s  rights  under  the  contract
with  the  insurer  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  tortfeasor.  The
rights  of  either  the  bank  or  the  furniture  company  stem  from
the  victim-insurer  settlement  agreement.  The  victim  had  a
good-faith  belief  in  the  validity  of  his  claim  against  the
insurer.  Thus, 
them,
whereby the victim surrendered his claim, was supported by
consideration. Since the insurer’s settlement promise (to pay
the  victim  $5,000)  was  not  conditional  on  the  tortfeasor’s
policy’s  being  valid  as  against  the  insurer,  the  fact  that  the
insurer  might  have  had  a  chance  to  void  the  policy  pre-
settlement  on  the  grounds  of  the  tortfeasor’s  minority  (an
unlikely chance anyway) is irrelevant, and the settlement was
unconditionally  binding  on  the  insurer.  Then,  the  victim  was
entitled to assign whatever right to payment he had under the
contract, and that’s what he did. His rights did not spring from
any beneficiary status under the insurer-tortfeasor agreement;
since A states otherwise, it’s wrong.
(B)  is  wrong  because  the  insurer  will  be  liable  under  its
contract  with  the  victim,  regardless  of  the  tortfeasor’s
ultimate irresponsibility. The victim had a good-faith belief in
the  validity  of  his  claim  against  the  insurer.  Thus,  the
settlement  agreement  between  them,  whereby  the  victim
surrendered his claim, was supported by consideration. Since

291

(an  unlikely  chance  anyway) 

the  insured’s  settlement  promise  (to  pay  the  victim  $5,000)
was not conditional on the tortfeasor’s policy’s being valid as
against  the  insurer,  the  fact  that  the  insurer  might  have  been
able  to  void  the  policy  pre-settlement  on  the  grounds  of  the
tortfeasor’s  minority 
is
irrelevant, and the settlement was unconditionally binding on
the  insurer.  Thus  this  choice  is  not  correct  in  saying  that  the
insurer is liable only if it “knowingly waived the defense of
the  tortfeasor’s  minority  and  irresponsibility.”  (The  victim’s
unconditional right to payment was thus properly assigned to
either  the  bank  or  the  furniture  company,  whichever  had
priority.)

(C) is wrong because the tortfeasor’s minority is not relevant
to  either  the  bank’s  or  the  furniture  company’s  rights  as
assignees  of  the  victim’s  rights.  The  victim  had  a  good-faith
belief  in  the  validity  of  his  claim  against  the  insurer.
Therefore  the  settlement  agreement  between  them,  whereby
the  victim  surrendered  his  claim,  was  supported  by
consideration. Since the insured’s settlement promise (to pay
the  victim  $5,000)  was  not  conditional  on  the  tortfeasor’s
policy’s  being  valid  as  against  the  insurer,  the  fact  that  the
insurer  might  have  had  a  chance  to  avoid  the  policy  pre-
settlement  on  the  grounds  of  the  tortfeasor’s  minority  (an
unlikely chance anyway) is irrelevant, and the settlement was
unconditionally binding on the insurer. As assignee, the bank
or the furniture company assumed the victim’s rights under the
contract, and could enforce the insurer’s promise to pay.

Question  59:  Gyro,  an  expert  in  lifting  and  emplacing
equipment  atop  tall  buildings,  contracted  in  a  signed  writing
to  lift  and  emplace  certain  air-conditioning  equipment  atop
Tower’s building. The contract contained a clause providing
for per diem damages if Gyro did not complete performance

292

by a specified date, and a clause providing that “time is of the
essence.”  Another  clause  provided  that  any  subsequent
agreement for extra work under the contract must be in writing
and signed by both parties.

time 

the  contract 

With  ample 
for
remaining  under 
commencement  and  completion  of  his  performance,  Gyro
notified Tower that he was selling his business to Copter, who
was  equally  expert  in  lifting  and  emplacing  equipment  atop
tall  buildings,  and  that  Copter  had  agreed  to  “take  over  the
Gyro-Tower contract.”

Tower  orally  agreed  with  Gyro  to  accept  Copter’s  services.
Copter performed on time but negligently installed the wrong
air-conditioning equipment.

Will Tower succeed in an action against Gyro for damages for
breach of contract?

(A)  Yes, because Tower did not agree to release Gyro from

liability under the Gyro-Tower contract.

(B)    Yes,  because  Tower  received  no  consideration  for  the

substitution of Copter for Gyro.

(C)    No,  because  by  accepting  the  substitution  of  Copter  for
Gyro, Tower effected a novation, and Gyro was thereby
discharged of his duties under the Gyro-Tower contract.
(D)    No,  because  the  liquidated-damage  clause  in  the  Gyro-
Tower  contract  provided  only  for  damages  caused  by
delay in performance.

Answer 59: Choice (A)  is  correct.  The  sale  of  the  business
by Gyro to Copter was both an assignment of rights under the
Gyro-Tower  contract  and  a  delegation  of  duties  under  it.
When a delegation occurs, the delegator (here, Gyro) remains
liable  to  the  obligee  (here,  Tower)  unless  the  obligee
expressly releases the delegator and agrees to look solely to
the  delegate  (Copter);  if  this  occurred  it  would  be  a
“novation.”  The  mere  fact  that  the  obligee  agrees  to  the
delegation does not by itself constitute a novation or release
the  delegator  from  liability.  Here,  therefore,  although  Tower
agreed  to  the  delegation  (i.e.,  agreed  to  accept  performance
from Copter), he did not agree to a novation and therefore did
not release Gyro.

293

(B) is wrong because: (1) an obligee’s assent to a delegation
does  not  require  consideration;  and  (2)  even  though  Tower
validly  assented  to  Copter’s  doing  the  work,  this  did  not
release  Gyro  from  liability,  for  the  reason  explained  in  the
analysis of Choice (A).

(C) is wrong because the mere fact that an obligee assents to a
delegation  does  not  effect  a  novation.  Instead,  a  novation  is
deemed  to  occur  only  when  the  obligee  expressly  agrees  to
release the obligee and look solely to the delegate; there was
therefore  no  novation  here.  (If  there  had  been  a  novation,  it
would  indeed  have  served  to  discharge  Gyro,  as  this  choice
suggests.)

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  the  liquidated-damages
clause  covered  only  delay  damages  does  not  mean  that
damages  for  other  breaches  (e.g.,  timely  but  non-conforming
work) cannot be recovered. A liquidated damages clause that
is  restricted  to  a  certain  type  of  breach  leaves  common-law
damages intact for other types of breach.

III.  THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES

A.  When beneficiary may sue

1.  Intended beneficiaries may sue

a.  Intended beneficiary

Question 60: A written contract was entered into between an
investor and a winery. The contract provided that the investor
would  invest  $1  million  in  the  winery  for  its  capital
expansion and, in return, that the winery, from grapes grown
in  its  famous  vineyards,  would  produce  and  market  at  least
500,000  bottles  of  wine  each  year  for  five  years  under  the
investor’s label.
The contract included provisions that the parties would share
equally  the  profits  and  losses  from  the  venture  and  that,  if
feasible,  the  wine  would  be  distributed  by  the  winery  only
through  a  specific  distributor  of  fine  wines.  Neither  the
investor  nor  the  winery  had  previously  dealt  with  the
distributor.  The  distributor  learned  of  the  contract  two  days
later  from  reading  a  trade  newspaper.  In  reliance  thereon,  it

294

immediately  hired  an  additional  sales  executive  and
contracted  for  enlargement  of  its  wine  storage  and  display
facility. If the winery refuses to distribute the wine through the
distributor and the distributor then sues the winery for breach
of contract, is it likely that the distributor will prevail?

(A)  Yes, because the winery’s performance was to run to the

distributor rather than to the investor.

(B)    Yes,  because  the  investor  and  the  winery  could
reasonably foresee that the distributor would change its
position in reliance on the contract.

(C)  No, because the investor and the winery did not expressly
agree that the distributor would have enforceable rights
under their contract.

(D)    No,  because  the  investor  and  the  winery,  having  no
apparent  motive  to  benefit  the  distributor,  appeared  in
making  the  contract  to  have  been  protecting  or  serving
only their own interests.

Answer 60: Choice (D) is correct, because it recognizes the
central reason the distributor can’t recover under the contract:
It is an incidental beneficiary, and thus it has no rights under
the contract. When two parties enter into a contract, there are
two  types  of  beneficiaries  that  may  be  created:  intended
beneficiaries  and  incidental  beneficiaries.  Only  intended
beneficiaries have enforceable rights under the contract. Most
courts determine whether a beneficiary is intended by looking
at the intent of the promisee (the original contracting party to
whom  the  promise  in  question  was  made).  If  the  promisee
intends (even though it is not his sole or even primary intent)
that  the  third  party  receive  benefit  from  the  promisor’s
performance, the third party is an intended beneficiary; if not,
he has no enforceable rights under the contract. (Some courts
also look secondarily to the intent of the promisor.)

Here,  there  is  no  sign  that  either  the  investor  or  the  winery
had  any  intent  to  benefit  the  distributor:  The  facts  instead
suggest  that  these  original  parties  intended  to  distribute
through  the  distributor  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  wine  was
distributed  correctly,  and  thus  the  use  of  the  distributor  was
intended  solely  to  benefit  the  parties  themselves,  not  the
distributor.  This  prevents  the  distributor  from  being  an

295

intended beneficiary.

to 

that 

the  winery’s  performance  would  run 

(A) is wrong, because it attaches too much importance to the
the
fact 
distributor.  Only  intended  beneficiaries  have  enforceable
rights  under  the  contract.  Courts  determine  whether  a
beneficiary is intended mainly by looking at the intent of the
promisee (the one to whom the duty in question is owed), and
sometimes  secondarily  at  the  intent  of  the  promisor.  It’s  true
that in assessing this intent, one of the factors is whether the
promisor’s  performance  is  to  run  directly  to  the  third  party;
this  factor  points  towards  a  finding  that  the  beneficiary  was
intended.  But  this  “to  whom  performance  runs”  factor  is  at
best  a  “tie-breaker”  to  be  used  when  the  other  evidence  of
intent-to-benefit  is  unclear  or  evenly-balanced.  Here,  all  the
indications are that the winery and the investor specified this
particular  distributor  only  to  benefit  their  own  business
interests,  not  to  benefit  the  distributor.  So  the  fact  that
performance  would  run  to  the  distributor  is  not  needed  as  a
tie-breaker, and therefore doesn’t change the outcome.

(B) is wrong, because reasonable foreseeability of reliance is
not an adequate basis on which the distributor could recover.
In order to recover, the distributor would have to have been
an intended beneficiary under the winery-investor contract. It
is  the  intent  of  the  original  parties  (principally  the  promisee
of  the  performance  in  question)  that  determines  whether  the
distributor  was  an  intended  beneficiary.  Thus,  the  mere
foreseeability of the distributor’s reliance wouldn’t be enough
to  give  him  enforceable  rights  under  the  contract;  only  the
intent of the original parties would matter.

the 

in  determining  when 

Reliance  can  be  relevant  in  the  third-party  beneficiary
context,  but  only 
intended
beneficiary’s rights “vest.” (Before vesting, but not after, the
parties  can  modify  or  rescind  the  contract  without  the
beneficiary’s consent.) If the distributor had been an intended
beneficiary,  then  his  rights  would  have  vested  as  soon  as  he
detrimentally  relied  on  the  contract.  But  here,  he  never
attained  intended-beneficiary  status,  so  his  reliance  never
became relevant to any issue in the case.
(C) is wrong, because it overstates what’s necessary to create

296

an intended beneficiary. The distributor could, in theory, have
enforceable  rights  under  the  contract  without  there  being  an
express provision in the contract. Courts determine whether a
beneficiary  is  intended  by  looking  at  whether  the  original
parties  (principally  the  promisee,  the  one  to  whom  the
promise  in  question  is  made)  intended  to  benefit  the
the
beneficiary.  But

agreement to benefit the third party is required, it’s wrong.

i.  Tie-breaker looks to whom the performance is rendered

Question 61: Elda, the aged mother of Alice and Barry, both
adults,  wished  to  employ  a  live-in  companion  so  that  she
might  continue  to  live  in  her  own  home.  Elda,  however,  had
only  enough  income  to  pay  one-half  of  the  companion’s
$2,000  monthly  salary.  Learning  of  their  mother’s  plight,
Alice  and  Barry  agreed  with  each  other  in  a  signed  writing
that  on  the  last  day  of  January  and  each  succeeding  month
during  their  mother’s  lifetime,  each  would  give  Elda  $500.
Elda then hired the companion.

Alice  and  Barry  made  the  agreed  payments  in  January,
February,  and  March.  In  April,  however,  Barry  refused  to
make any payment and notified Alice and Elda that he would
make no further payments.

Will Elda succeed in an action for $500 brought against Barry
after April 30?

(A)    Yes,  because  by  making  his  first  three  payments,  Barry

confirmed his intent to contract.

(B)  Yes, because Elda is an intended beneficiary of a contract

between Alice and Barry.

(C)  No, because a parent cannot sue her child for breach of a

promise for support.

(D)  No, because Alice and Barry intended their payments to

Elda to be gifts.

Answer 61: Choice (B) is correct. The issue is whether Elda
was  an  intended  beneficiary  of  the  Alice-Barry  contract;  if
she was, she can sue, and if she wasn’t, she can’t. It’s pretty
clear  from  the  context  that  Alice  (the  promisee  of  Barry’s

297

promise)  desired  to  help  her  mother;  therefore,  Elda  is  an
intended  beneficiary  of  Barry’s  promise  even  though  Alice
was also motivated by a desire not to pay for the companion
entirely by herself. In other words, Alice’s “mixed motives”
don’t  disqualify  Elda  from  being  an  intended  beneficiary,  as
long as one of Alice’s motives was to help Elda. The fact that
performance by Barry (payment of $500 per month) was to be
rendered directly to Elda, rather than to Alice, also pushes the
classification  toward  a  finding  that  Elda  was  an  intended
beneficiary.

(A)  is  wrong  because  Barry’s  making  of  the  first  three
payments is irrelevant — from the conduct and motivation of
the parties in making the contract, we know that Elda was an
intended  beneficiary  (as  discussed  in  Choice  (B)  above),  so
Elda would have been entitled to sue Barry for non-payment
even if he had not made any prior payments.

(C) is wrong because it ignores the significance of the three-
party  context.  In  a  two-party  scenario  in  which  all  that
happens  is  that  a  child  promises  to  pay  for  the  parent’s
support, this promise may indeed be unenforceable for lack of
consideration. But in a three-party case like this one, the law
of third-party beneficiaries can change the result. Here, each
of the children’s promises supplies consideration for the other
child’s return promise; therefore, lack of consideration is not
a  problem  even 
is  not  herself  giving
consideration.

though  Elda 

(D)  is  wrong  because,  while  it  is  true  that  Alice  and  Barry
both  intended  their  payments  to  be  gifts,  this  fact  does  not
prevent  Elda  from  being  an  intended  beneficiary,  who
therefore gets the right to sue either promisor for breach. The
whole  idea  of  a  “donee  beneficiary”  (as  opposed  to  a
“creditor beneficiary”) is that a person to whom the promisee
intends to make a gift becomes an intended beneficiary (of the
“donee” sub-category).

2.  Incidental beneficiaries

a.  Real estate neighbors

Question 62: A landowner was land-rich by inheritance but
losses  on  bad
money-poor,  having 

suffered 

severe 

298

investments,  but  still  owned  several  thousand  acres  of
unencumbered  timberland.  He  had  a  large  family,  and  his
normal, fixed personal expenses were high. Pressed for cash,
he advertised a proposed sale of standing timber on a choice
2,000-acre  tract.  The  only  response  was  from  a  logging
company,  which  operated  a  large,  integrated  construction
enterprise.  The  logging  company,  after  inspection  of  the
advertised  tract,  offered  a  fair  price  for  the  timber  rights  in
question,  and  the  landowner  accepted  the  offer.  The  2,000-
acre  tract  was  an  abundant  wild-game  habitat  and  had  been
used  for  many  years,  with  the  landowner’s  permission,  by
area  hunters.  The  logging  company’s  performance  of  the
timber  contract  would  destroy  this  habitat.  Without  legal
excuse and over the landowner’s strong objection, the logging
the  contract  before  commencing
company 
performance. The landowner could not afford to hire a lawyer
and take legal action, and made no attempt to assign any cause
of action he might have had against the logging company.

repudiated 

If  the  logging  company  is  sued  for  breach  of  the  contract  by
the landowner’s next-door neighbor, whose view of a nearby
lake  is  obscured  by  the  standing  timber,  the  neighbor  will
probably
(A)    lose,  as  only  an  incidental  beneficiary,  if  any,  of  the

logging company-landowner contract.
(B)  lose, as a maintainer of nuisance litigation.
(C)    prevail,  as  a  third-party  intended  beneficiary  of  the

logging company-landowner contract.

(D)  prevail, as a surrogate for the landowner in view of his

inability to enforce the contract.

Answer  62:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Incidental  beneficiaries
cannot  enforce  a  contract  if  one  of  the  original  parties  to  it
defaults. Since there will often be many people indirectly or
even directly benefited by any given contractual performance,
the  term  “incidental  beneficiary”  is  used  to  describe  those
persons who would benefit by the performance but who were
not intended by the original parties to be benefited. Here, the
landowner’s  neighbor’s  rights  under  the  landowner-logging
company  contract  are  those  of  an  incidental  beneficiary,  at
best — neither  the  landowner  nor  the  logging  company

299

intended to confer any benefit (and certainly not the benefit of
an  improved  view)  upon  the  neighbor  when  they  made  the
contract.  Therefore,  the  neighbor  cannot  recover  against  the
logging company for breach.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  a  suit  is  “nuisance
litigation” will not be a ground on which the defendant to the
suit  can  win.  Instead,  if  the  defendant  wins  “on  the  merits,”
the  fact  that  the  suit  was  so  meritless  as  to  have  been  a
nuisance might be grounds for the original defendant to win a
tort-like recovery from the original plaintiff in a second suit,
brought  by  the  original  defendant  for  wrongful  use  of  civil
proceedings. So here, the fact that the neighbor was bringing a
“nuisance  litigation”  would  be  irrelevant  to  whether  the
neighbor would win.

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  neighbor  was  not  an  intended
beneficiary.  For  a  third  party  to  be  an  intended  beneficiary,
the  circumstances  must  indicate  that  at  least  one  of  the
original parties intended to give the beneficiary the benefit of
the  intended  promise.  Here,  this  is  not  so,  for  the  reasons
described in Choice (A) above.
(D)  is  wrong  because  no  rights  were  transferred  to  the
neighbor  to  allow  him  to  sue  as  a  surrogate.  The  neighbor
cannot  claim  to  be  a  surrogate  standing  in  to  enforce  the
landowner’s  rights  under  the  contract  unless  he  can  show
some  relation  to  the  contract.  The  facts  state  that  the
landowner has made no attempt to assign to his neighbor any
cause  of  action  he  might  have  against  the  logging  company;
nor do the facts state any other legal relationship between the
landowner and his neighbor that might be the basis for some
sort of surrogacy.

B.  Discharge or modification by the original parties

Question  63:  On  May  4,  Mater  and  Nirvana  Motors  both
signed a single document evidencing a contract for the sale by
Nirvana  to  Mater,  “as  a  wedding  gift  for  Mater’s  son
Gilbert,”  a  new  Mark  XX  Rolls-Royce  sedan,  for  $180,000
cash  on  delivery.  On  May  5,  Mater  handed  Gilbert  a
photocopy  of  this  document.  In  reliance  on  the  prospective
gift,  Gilbert  on  May  20  sold  his  nearly  new  Cheetah  (an

300

expensive  sports  car)  to  a  dealer  at  a  “bargain”  price  of
$50,000 and immediately informed Mater and Nirvana that he
had done so.

On May 25, however,  Mater  and  Nirvana  Motors  by  mutual
agreement  rescinded  in  a  signed  writing  “any  and  all
agreements heretofore made between the undersigned parties
for  the  sale-and-purchase  of  a  new  Mark  XX  Rolls-Royce
sedan.”  Later  that  day,  Nirvana  sold  for  $190,000  cash  to
another buyer the only new Mark XX Rolls-Royce that it had
in stock or could readily obtain elsewhere. On June 1, Gilbert
tendered $180,000 in cash to Nirvana Motors and demanded
delivery to him “within a reasonable time” of a new Mark XX
Rolls-Royce sedan with all available equipment.

Nirvana rejected the tender and denied any obligation.

If  Gilbert  sues  Nirvana  for  breach  of  contract,  which  of  the
following will the court probably decide?
(A)  Gilbert wins, because his rights as an assignee for value
of the May 4 Mater-Nirvana contract cannot be cut off by
agreement between the original parties.

(B)  Gilbert wins, because his rights as a third-party intended
beneficiary became vested by his prejudicial reliance in
selling his Cheetah on May 20.

(C)  Nirvana wins, because Gilbert, if an intended beneficiary
at  all  of  the  Mater-Nirvana  contract,  was  only  a  donee
beneficiary.

(D)    Nirvana  wins,  because  it  reasonably  and  prejudicially
relied on its contract of mutual rescission with Mater by
selling  the  only  readily  available  new  Mark  XX  Rolls-
Royce sedan to another buyer.

Answer  63:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Gilbert  is  an  intended
beneficiary  of  the  Mater-Nirvana  agreement,  since  Mater
made  it  clear  that  her  primary  purpose  in  entering  into  the
contract  was  to  provide  a  wedding  gift  for  Gilbert.  The
original  parties’  power  to  modify  the  contract  without  the
beneficiary’s  consent  terminates  if  the  beneficiary,  before  he
receives  notification  of  the  discharge  or  modification,  does
any  of  three  things:  (1)  materially  changes  his  position  in
justifiable reliance  on  the  promise;  (2)  brings  suit  on  it;  or

301

(3) manifests assent to it at the request of either of the original
parties. Here, Gilbert did the first of these, by selling his old
car  at  a  discount,  in  justifiable  reliance  on  the  forthcoming
gift. Once he did that, both Mater and Nirvana lost the ability
to  modify  the  contract  without  Gilbert’s  consent.  Therefore,
Gilbert has the right to sue the promisor, Nirvana, for breach.

(A) is wrong because Gilbert is not an “assignee for value” of
the  Mater-Nirvana  contract;  he’s  a  third-party  beneficiary  of
it. He’s not an “assignee” at all (neither of the original parties
assigned  him  any  right),  and  he’s  certainly  not  an  assignee
“for value,” since he didn’t pay or give anything of value to
either of the original parties.

(C)  is  wrong  because,  although  Gilbert  is  indeed  a  donee
beneficiary,  that  status  did  not  prevent  his  rights  from
“vesting”  when  he  changed  position  in  reliance  on  the
agreement.  (Donee  beneficiaries  and  creditor  beneficiaries
have  the  same  rights  regarding  modifications  by  the  original
parties.)

(D) is wrong because Nirvana’s reliance on the rescission is
irrelevant.  The  promisor  under  a  third-party  beneficiary
contract  is  expected  to  know  the  rules  governing  such
contracts,  and  those  rules  include  the  rule  that  a  beneficiary
who  detrimentally  relies  on  the  contract  gets  an  immediate
vesting.

Question  64:  On  March  1,  Zeller  orally  agreed  to  sell  his
land,  Homestead,  to  Byer  for  $46,000  to  be  paid  on  March
31. Byer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price
to  Quincy  in  satisfaction  of  a  debt  which  Zeller  said  he  had
promised to pay Quincy.
On March 10, Byer dictated the agreement to his secretary but
omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to Quincy.
Neither  Byer  nor  Zeller  carefully  read  the  writing  before
signing  it  on  March  15.  Neither  raised  any  question
concerning omission of the payment to Quincy.
In an action by Quincy against Byer for $25,000, which of the
following, if proved, would best serve Byer as a defense?
(A) 

  There  was  no  consideration  to  support  Zeller’s
antecedent promise to pay Quincy the $25,000.

302

(B)    On  March  5,  before  Quincy  was  aware  of  the  oral
agreement  between  Zeller  and  Byer,  Zeller  agreed  with
Byer not to pay any part of the purchase price to Quincy.
(C)  Whatever action Quincy may have had against Zeller was
barred by the statute of limitations prior to March 1.
(D)  Before he instituted his action against Byer, Quincy had
not notified either Byer or Zeller that he had accepted the
Byer-Zeller arrangement for paying Quincy.

to 

the  promise;  (2) 

Answer 64: Choice (B) is correct. An intended beneficiary to
a  contract  only  has  enforceable  rights  under  that  contract
when his rights “vest.” Before the rights vest, the beneficiary
can’t  stop  the  parties  from  modifying  or  rescinding  the
contract. Under the modern/Restatement view, a beneficiary’s
rights  vest  when  any  of  these  three  events  occurs:  (1)  the
the
beneficiary  manifests  assent 
beneficiary sues to enforce the promise; or (3) the beneficiary
justifiably  relies  on  the  promise  to  his  detriment.  Thus,  if
Byer  and  Zeller  eliminated  the  Quincy  payment  provision
before  Quincy  even  found  out  about  the  contract,  Quincy
couldn’t possibly have either “manifested assent” (#1 above),
“sued  to  enforce  the  promise”  (#2)  or  “justifiably  relie[d]”
(#3).  That  meant  that  Quincy’s  rights  could  not  yet  have
vested  as  of  the  moment  the  original  two  parties  to  the
contract (Byer and Zeller) modified the contract, and not-yet-
vested beneficiary rights may be rescinded or modified by the
original parties at any time.

(A) is not the best response, because a promise by one of the
original  contracting  parties  to  make  payment  to  a  third-party
beneficiary  does  not  need  separate  consideration  from  the
beneficiary.  The  only  consideration  that’s  relevant  under  the
Byer-Zeller  contract  is  whether  there  was  consideration  to
support  the  contract  itself,  and  there  was  such — Byer
received  Zeller’s  promise 
the  property  as
consideration for his, Byer’s, promise to make the $46,000 in
total payments.
(C) is not the best response, because any time-bar of Quincy’s
right to sue Zeller is not relevant to Byer’s duty to pay Quincy.
As  discussed  in  (A),  there  does  not  need  to  be  separate
consideration for one contracting party’s promise to pay some

to  convey 

303

of  the  contract  price  to  a  third  party  beneficiary.  Therefore,
Quincy  can  recover  under  the  Byer-Zeller  agreement  if  he
was  an  intended  beneficiary  (or  an  assignee).  Thus,  it
wouldn’t  matter  if  Zeller  had  an  enforceable  debt  to  Quincy
or  not — Zeller  could  be  giving  Quincy  money  as  a  gift  and
Quincy  would  still  have  enforceable  rights.  (The  only
significance  of  the  debt  is  that  it  would  make  Quincy  a
creditor  beneficiary  instead  of  a  donee  beneficiary,  but  that
distinction  rarely  matters  today,  and  doesn’t  matter  on  these
facts.)

(D)  is  not  the  best  response,  because  Quincy’s  notifying  the
parties  of  his  acceptance  of  the  agreement  wouldn’t  be
relevant to his ability to prevail. An intended beneficiary can
(as long as his rights haven’t previously been cut off by one of
the events described in (B) above) sue the promisor without
having first notified either of the two original parties that the
beneficiary  was  “accepting.”  If  Quincy  had  given  such  a
notice, that notice would serve to “vest” his rights (it would
be  a  “manifestation  of  assent”).  But  even  absent  such  a
manifestation, the bringing of suit would vest Quincy’s rights,
if the original parties hadn’t modified or rescinded the rights
first.

Question 65: Kabb, the owner of a fleet of taxis, contracted
with Petrol, a dealer in petroleum products, for the purchase
and sale of Kabb’s total requirements of gasoline and oil for
one  year.  As  part  of  that  agreement,  Petrol  also  agreed  with
Kabb that for one year Petrol would place all his advertising
with  Ada  Artiste,  Kabb’s  wife,  who  owned  her  own  small
advertising agency. When Artiste was informed of the Kabb-
Petrol contract, she declined to accept an advertising account
from  the  Deturgid  Soap  Company  because  she  could  not
handle both the Petrol and Deturgid accounts during the same
year.

For this question only, assume the following facts. During the
first  month  of  the  contract,  Kabb  purchased  substantial
amounts of his gasoline from a supplier other than Petrol, and

304

Petrol  thereupon  notified  Artiste  that  he  would  no  longer
place his advertising with her agency.

In  an  action  against  Petrol  for  breach  of  contract,  Artiste
probably will

(A)    succeed,  because  she  is  a  third-party  beneficiary  of  the

Kabb-Petrol contract.

(B)    succeed,  because  Kabb  was  acting  as  Artiste’s  agent

when he contracted with Petrol.

(C)    not  succeed,  because  the  failure  of  a  constructive
condition  precedent  excused  Petrol’s  duty  to  place  his
advertising with Artiste.

(D)    not  succeed,  because  Artiste  did  not  provide  any
consideration  to  support  Petrol’s  promise  to  place  his
advertising with her.

if  Petrol  had  breached 

Answer 65: Choice (C) is correct. It is true that Artiste was a
third-party  beneficiary  of 
the  Kabb-Petrol  agreement.
the  agreement  by
Therefore, 
unjustifiably  failing  to  place  all  of  his  advertising  with
Artiste, Artiste would have been able to recover against him
for  breach.  However,  when  the  original  parties  to  an
agreement  each  make  a  promise  to  the  other,  each  party’s
substantial  performance  of  his  own  promise  is  generally  a
constructive  condition  to  the  other  party’s  obligation  to
perform any subsequent duties. Therefore, when Kabb failed
to  perform  his  obligations  early  in  the  contract  by  not
purchasing all his gas from Petrol, this was not only a breach
of  the  Kabb-Petrol  agreement  but  also  operated  as  the  non-
occurrence of a constructive condition to Petrol’s subsequent
duty  to  continue  using  Artiste  as  his  sole  source  for
advertising.  Therefore,  Petrol’s  notice  to  Artiste  that  he
would  not  use  her  for  any  further  advertising  was  neither  an
anticipatory repudiation nor a present breach, so that there is
nothing for Artiste to recover on.
(A) is wrong because, although Artiste is in fact a third-party
beneficiary of the Kabb-Petrol contract, this does not help her
because  Petrol  committed  no  breach,  for 
the  reasons
explained above.
(B) is wrong because even if Kabb is viewed as having been

305

Artiste’s agent when he obtained the promise from Petrol that
Petrol  would  buy  advertising  exclusively  from  Artiste,  this
will  not  entitle  Artiste  to  recover — Petrol’s  duty  to  Artiste
was dependent upon Kabb’s first not materially breaching any
prior obligations to Petrol, and as described above Kabb did
breach.

(D)  is  wrong  because  there  was  consideration  for  Petrol’s
promise to place all his advertising with Artiste. It’s true that
Artiste did not give consideration for this promise, but there
is no rule that says that the beneficiary of a promise must be
the  one  who  supplies  the  consideration — a  third-party  can
supply  it.  Here,  Kabb,  by  promising  to  buy  all  his  gas  from
Petrol,  was  supplying  consideration  for  Petrol’s  return
promise to place advertising with Artiste.

CHAPTER 11
IMPOSSIBILITY, IMPRACTICABILITY,
AND FRUSTRATION

I.    IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE

A.  Three classes

1.  Destruction of subject matter

a.  Sale of goods

i.  Destruction of identified goods

Question 66: On June 1, a seller agreed, in a writing signed
by  both  the  seller  and  the  buyer,  to  sell  an  antique  car  to  a
buyer  for  $20,000.  The  car  was  at  the  time  on  display  in  a
museum  in  a  different  city  and  was  to  be  delivered  to  the
buyer  on  August  1.  On  July  15,  before  the  risk  of  loss  had
passed  to  the  buyer,  the  car  was  destroyed  by  fire  without
fault of either party. Subsequent to the contract but before the
fire,  the  car  had  increased  in  value  to  $30,000.  The  seller
sued the buyer for the contract price of $20,000, and the buyer
counterclaimed for $30,000.
Which of the following will the court conclude?

(A)  Both claims fail.
(B)  Only the seller’s claim prevails.
(C)  Only the buyer’s claim prevails.
(D)  Both claims prevail.
Answer  66:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  UCC  §  2-613  provides
that  where  goods  that  are  “identified  at  the  time  the  contract
was made” are totally destroyed before the risk of their loss
has  passed  to  the  buyer  and  without  the  fault  of  either  party,
the  contract  is  “avoided,”  and  each  party  is  relieved  of  its
respective obligation to perform. Section 2-501 lists various
ways  that  particular  goods  will  be  deemed  “identified,”  one
of  which  is  that  at  the  time  of  contract  formation  the  parties
agreed  that  what  was  being  sold  was  a  particular  already-
existing and identified item. Since the parties here agreed that

307

what was being sold was the particular antique car on display
in  the  museum,  that  car  was  deemed  “identified”  to  the
contract.  Therefore,  §  2-613  applied,  and  both  parties’
obligations  were  discharged  by  the  total  destruction  of  the
car. Therefore, no claim under the contract could be asserted
by either party.

(B), (C), and (D) are all wrong because (A) is correct — the
total  destruction  of  the  car  caused  the  contract  to  be
discharged, and any claims asserted under it to be void. See
the analysis of Choice (A) for more details.

2.  Supervening illegality

Question  67:  Mermaid  owns  an  exceptionally  seaworthy
boat  that  she  charters  for  sport  fishing  at  a  $500  daily  rate.
The  fee  includes  the  use  of  the  boat  with  Mermaid  as  the
captain, and one other crew member, as well as fishing tackle
and  bait.  On  May  1,  Phinney  agreed  with  Mermaid  that
Phinney would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for
himself  and  his  family  for  $500.  Phinney  paid  an  advance
deposit  of  $200  and  signed  an  agreement  that  the  deposit
could  be  retained  by  Mermaid  as  liquidated  damages  in  the
event Phinney canceled or failed to appear.

On  May  15  at  1  a.m.,  the  Coast  Guard  had  issued  offshore
“heavy  weather”  warnings  and  prohibited  all  small  vessels
the  size  of  Mermaid’s  from  leaving  the  harbor.  This
prohibition remained in effect throughout the day. Phinney did
not  appear  at  all  on  May  15,  because  he  had  heard  the
weather warnings on his radio.

Which of the following is an accurate statement?

(A)  The contract is discharged because of impossibility, and

Phinney is entitled to return of his deposit.

(B)    The  contract  is  discharged  because  of  mutual  mistake
concerning  an  essential  fact,  and  Phinney  is  entitled  to
return of his deposit.

(C)    The  contract  is  not  discharged,  because  its  performance
was  possible  in  view  of  the  exceptional  seaworthiness
of Mermaid’s boat, and Phinney is not entitled to return
of his deposit.

(D)  The contract is not discharged, and Phinney is not entitled

308

to  return  of  his  deposit,  because  the  liquidated-damage
clause  in  effect  allocated  the  risk  of  bad  weather  to
Phinney.

Answer  67:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  Coast  Guard’s
prohibition  had  the  force  of  law,  so  that  prohibition
constituted  “supervening  illegality,”  a  form  of  impossibility.
When  the  defense  of  impossibility  applies,  the  court  will
normally cancel the contract and attempt to put the parties in
the position they were in before the contract was made. Doing
so in this case will require that Phinney get his deposit back.

(B)  is  wrong  because  “mutual  mistake”  is  deemed  to  occur
only when the parties are mistaken about some fact that exists
at  the  time  of  the  contract.  Where  some  supervening  event
renders  performance  impossible,  the  case  is  treated  as
involving impossibility, not mutual mistake (although the legal
effect is pretty much the same — the contract is canceled and
the  parties  are  restored  to  their  pre-contract  position  to  the
extent possible).
(C) is wrong because the Coast Guard’s prohibition made the
performance  impossible.  Where  a  supervening  rule  of  law
would make it illegal for a party to perform, the fact that the
party is physically capable of performing does not prevent the
impossibility doctrine from applying. Therefore, the fact that
the  boat  was  extra  seaworthy  did  not  make  performance
possible.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  liquidated-damages  clause  did  not
allocate  the  risk  of  a  supervening  illegality  to  Phinney.
Indeed,  a  liquidated  damages  clause  normally  does  not
allocate risk at all — it merely specifies what the amount of
damages  should  be  if,  based  on  other  contract  provisions,  a
breach  should  occur.  Here,  there  was  no  breach,  so  the
liquidated-damages clause plays no role.

II.   IMPRACTICABILITY

A.  Modern view of impracticability

1.  Allocation of risk by parties

a.  Implicit allocation

309

i.  Risk of technological breakthrough

type  of  magnetic  memory, 

Question 68: A computer company contracted in writing with
a bank to sell and deliver to the bank a mainframe computer
using  a  new 
then  under
development but not perfected by the computer company, at a
price substantially lower than that of a similar computer using
current technology. The contract’s delivery term was “F.O.B.
the bank, on or before July 31.”

After  making  the  contract  with  the  bank,  the  computer
company  discovered  that  the  new  technology  it  intended  to
use  was  unreliable  and  that  no  computer  manufacturer  could
yet  build  a  reliable  computer  using  that  technology.  The
company  thereupon  notified  the  bank  that  it  was  impossible
for  the  company  or  anyone  else  to  build  the  contracted-for
computer “in the present state of the art.” If the bank sues the
computer  company  for  failure  to  perform  its  contract,  the
court will probably decide the case in favor of

(A)    the  computer  company,  because  its  performance  of  the

contract was objectively impossible.

(B)    the  computer  company,  because  a  contract  to  build  a
machine  using  technology  under  development  imposes
only  a  duty  on  the  builder  to  use  its  best  efforts  to
achieve the result contracted for.

(C)  the bank, because the law of impossibility does not apply

to merchants under the applicable law.

(D)    the  bank,  because  the  computer  company  assumed  the
risk,  in  the  given  circumstances,  that  the  projected  new
technology would not work reliably.

Answer 68: Choice (D) is correct. The computer company’s
defense would have to be based on the UCC’s version of the
doctrine  of  commercial  impracticability.  Section  2-615(a)
says  that  “[d]elay  in  delivery  or  nondelivery  in  whole  or  in
part by a seller . . . is not a breach of his duty under a contract
if  performance  as  agreed  has  been  made
for  sale 
impracticable  by  the  occurrence  of  a  contingency  the  non-
occurrence  of  which  was  a  basic  assumption  on  which  the
contract  was  made  .  .  .  .  ”  So  if  the  computer  company  can
convince the court that the non-occurrence of the unreliability

310

of  the  new  technology  was  a  “basic  assumption”  behind  the
contract, the company would get off the hook.

to  use  commercial 

The problem for the computer company is that in determining
whether  the  non-occurrence  of  a  condition  (let’s  call  it
“condition X”) was a “basic assumption,” the court will look
to whether the parties implicitly or explicitly allocated to one
party  the  risk  of  the  non-occurrence  of  condition  X.  If  the
party  seeking 
impracticability  was
allocated this risk during the negotiations, that party can’t use
the  defense.  And  such  allocation  need  not  be  explicit  in  the
contract — the  court  can  infer  it  from  the  circumstances.
Where  one  party  (the  seller)  undertakes  to  manufacture  a
device  reliant  on  what  both  parties  know  will  be  new  and
untested technology, a court would almost certainly infer that
that  party,  not  the  buyer,  implicitly  bore  the  risk  that  the
anticipated 
to
materialize.

technological  breakthrough  would 

fail 

(A) is wrong because, as described in the analysis of choice
D above, even if performance by the computer company was
objectively  impossible,  this  won’t  get  the  company  off  the
hook, because it would be found to have assumed the risk that
the anticipated breakthrough would not materialize.
(B)  is  wrong  because  it  is  simply  not  a  correct  statement  of
the  law.  When  a  seller  contracts  to  build  and  deliver  a
machine 
incorporating  new  and  heretofore  untested
technology,  the  seller  has  a  binding  obligation  to  deliver  it,
unless  the  court  finds  that  the  parties  intended  to  excuse
performance  in  the  event  the  technology  does  not  come
through.  There’s  nothing  in  these  facts  to  indicate  that  the
parties intended such an excuse here. On the contrary, a court
would  almost  certainly  find  (as  detailed  in  the  analysis  of
choice D above) that the computer company assumed the risk
that it would be unable to make the needed breakthrough.
(C) is wrong because it is an incorrect statement of law: The
defense of impossibility does  essentially  apply  to  merchants
under the UCC, in the form of the commercial impracticability
defense.  It’s  true  that  the  UCC  doesn’t  use  the  word
“impossibility.”  But  §  2-615  gives  a  defense  called  “excuse
by  failure  of  presupposed  conditions,”  a  defense  that  is

referred

to  as  “commercial

(However, as detailed above, the computer company won’t be
able to successfully use the impracticability defense on these
facts.)

ii. Foreseeability and relative expertise

Question 69:  For  an  agreed  price  of  $20  million,  a  builder
contracted  with  a  developer  to  design  and  build  on  the
developer’s  commercial  plot  a  15-story  office  building.  In
excavating  for  the  foundation  and  underground  utilities,  the
contractor encountered a massive layer of granite at a depth of
15  feet.  By  reasonable  safety  criteria, 
the  building’s
foundation  required  a  minimum  excavation  of  25  feet.  When
the  contract  was  made,  neither  the  developer  nor  the
contractor  was  aware  of  the  subsurface  granite,  for  the
presence  of  which  neither  party  had  hired  a  qualified  expert
to test.

Claiming accurately that removal of enough granite to permit
the construction as planned would cost him an additional $3
million and a probable net loss on the contract of $2 million,
the  contractor  refused  to  proceed  with  the  work  unless  the
developer  would  promise  to  pay  an  additional  $2.5  million
for the completed building.

If the developer refuses and sues the contractor for breach of
contract,  which  of  the  following  will  the  court  probably
decide?

(A)    The  contractor  is  excused  under  the  modern  doctrine  of
includes  severe
impossibility,  which 

supervening 
impracticability.

(B)    The  contractor  is  excused,  because  the  contract  is
voidable  on  account  of  the  parties’  mutual  mistake
concerning an essential underlying fact.

(C)  The developer prevails, because the contractor assumed
the  risk  of  encountering  subsurface  granite  that  was
unknown to the developer.

(D)    The  developer  prevails,  unless  subsurface  granite  was
previously  unknown  anywhere  in  the  vicinity  of  the
developer’s construction site.

Answer  69:  Choice  (C) 

is  correct.  The  doctrine  of

312

commercial  impracticability  can  cover  situations  in  which  a
pre-existing  fact  of  which  the  parties  were  unaware  at  the
time  of  contracting  becomes  known  later,  and  renders
performance  impracticable.  However,  the  impracticability
defense will not apply where the party asserting it is found to
have  expressly  or  impliedly  borne  the  risk  of  the  event  in
question.  Here,  two  facts  strongly  militate  against  the
builder’s  being  excused  under  the  doctrine:  (1)  in  any
substantial excavation project, there is a very foreseeable risk
of  finding  unexpectedly  large  rock  deposits,  and  the  more
foreseeable the risk, the less likely it is to be excusable under
the  impracticability  doctrine;  and  (2)  the  builder  as  a
professional  builder  has  more  experience  with  the  business
risks involved in excavation than does a typical owner, so it
makes economic sense to put the risk of an excavation-related
surprise  (or  the  burden  of  negotiating  a  clause  dealing
specifically  with  that  risk)  on  the  builder  rather  than  on  the
owner.

(A) is wrong because, as described in the analysis of Choice
(C), the doctrine of impracticability does not apply where the
party  seeking  to  use  the  doctrine  is  found  to  have  impliedly
borne  the  risk  of  the  event  in  question,  as  the  builder  would
be found to have done here.
(B) is wrong because, while mutual mistake might apply here
just  as  impracticability  might  apply,  the  doctrine  of  mutual
mistake  will  not  apply  where  the  party  seeking  to  assert  it
would be found to have borne the risk of that type of mistake,
and the builder would be found to have borne that risk here.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  builder  would  be  found  to  have
borne the risk of subsurface granite even if such granite was
previously unknown in the vicinity of the construction site — 
as  further  explained  in  the  analysis  of  Choice  (C)  above,  a
builder  will  normally  be  found  to  have  borne  the  risk  of
unfavorable sub-surface conditions.

III.  FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE

A.  Factors to be considered

1.  Foreseeability

313

a.  Allocation of risk

Question  70:  On  August  1,  Geriatrics,  Inc.,  operating  a
“lifetime  care”  home  for  the  elderly,  admitted  Ohlster,  who
was  84  years  old,  for  a  trial  period  of  two  months.  On
September  25,  Ohlster  and  Geriatrics  entered  into  a  written
lifetime care contract with an effective commencement date of
October  1.  The  full  contract  price  was  $20,000,  which,  as
required  by  the  terms  of  the  contract,  Ohlster  prepaid  to
Geriatrics on September 25. Ohlster died of a heart attack on
October 2.

In  a  restitutionary  action,  can  the  administratrix  of  Ohlster’s
estate, a surviving sister, recover on behalf of the estate either
all or part of the $20,000 paid to Geriatrics on September 25?

(A)    Yes,  because  Geriatrics  would  otherwise  be  unjustly

enriched at Ohlster’s expense.

(B)  Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.
(C)    No,  because  Ohlster’s  life  span  and  the  duration  of
Geriatrics’  commitment  to  him  was  a  risk  assumed  by
both parties.

(D)    No,  but  only  if  Geriatrics  can  show  that  between
September 25 and Ohlster’s death it rejected, because of
its  commitment  to  Ohlster,  an  application  for  lifetime
care from another elderly person.

Answer  70:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  contract  will  be
enforced  as  written  (i.e.,  no  restitutionary  recovery)  unless
the estate can come up with a legal theory why it shouldn’t be.
The  only  plausible  theory  is  frustration  of  purpose.  But  the
frustration  defense  will  not  be  recognized  where  the  parties
are found to have expressly or implicitly allocated the risk of
the  event  in  question.  Here,  a  court  would  almost  certainly
conclude that given Ohlster’s advanced age, he took the risk
that  he  would  die  before  obtaining  substantial  benefits  from
the  contract,  and  Geriatrics  took  the  opposite  risk  that  he
would live so long that the deal would be a very bad one for
Geriatrics.
(A)  is  wrong  because,  although  Geriatrics  has  clearly  been
“enriched,”  a  court  would  be  unlikely  to  hold  that  the
enrichment  was  unjust,  in  view  of  the  substantial  risk  that

314

Geriatrics took that Ohlster would live a very long time.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose
will  not  apply  where  the  party  seeking  to  use  it  is  found  to
have impliedly borne the risk of the event in question, and the
court  will  probably  make  such  a  finding  here,  as  detailed  in
the discussion of Choice (C) above.

(D)  is  wrong  because  Geriatrics  will  win  even  if  it  cannot
show that it rejected some other lifetime-care application on
account  of  its  deal  with  Ohlster — the  contract  will  be
enforced  as  written  unless  some  defense  applies,  and  no
defense applies here.

IV.  RESTITUTION AND RELIANCE WHERE THE

PARTIES ARE DISCHARGED

A.  Restitution

1.  Time for measuring benefit

Question 71: A lawyer entered into a contract with a painter
by  the  terms  of  which  the  painter  was  to  paint  the  lawyer’s
office for $1,000 and was required to do all of the work over
the  following  weekend  so  as  to  avoid  disruption  of  the
lawyer’s business. The painter commenced work on Saturday
morning, and had finished half the painting by the time he quit
work for the day. That night, without the fault of either party,
the office building was destroyed by fire.

Which of the following is an accurate statement?

(A)    Both  parties’  contractual  duties  are  discharged,  and  the

painter can recover nothing from the lawyer.

(B)    Both  parties’  contractual  duties  are  discharged,  but  the
painter can recover in quasi-contract from the lawyer.
(C)  Only the painter’s contractual duty is discharged, because
the lawyer’s performance (payment of the agreed price)
is not impossible.

(D)  Only the painter’s contractual duty is discharged, and the
painter  can  recover  his  reliance  damages  from  the
lawyer.

Answer 71: Choice (B) is correct. First, since the continued

315

existence of the office being painted was a major assumption
on which the contract was based, the destruction of the office
will  cause  both  parties  to  be  contractually  discharged.
Second, when contractual duties are discharged on account of
impossibility,  a  party  who  has  partly  performed  will
generally  be  permitted  to  recover  in  quasi-contract  for
restitution,  i.e.,  for  the  value  of  the  benefit  conferred  on  the
other  party.  Therefore,  the  painter  will  be  permitted  to
recover for the value of the painting that he had done as of the
moment of the fire.

(A) is wrong because, as discussed in the analysis of Choice
(B)  above,  a  party  who  has  partly  performed  by  the  time  of
the  event  causing  the  discharge  is  permitted  to  recover  in
quasi-contract for the value of his partial performance.

(C) is wrong because the lawyer’s performance is discharged
not  because  it  is  impossible,  but  because  the  performance
which  the  lawyer  was  to  receive  in  exchange  for  her  own
performance  (a  paint  job)  is  impossible.  When  performance
of one side of the agreed exchange is rendered impossible, the
other  side  is  discharged  so  as  to  prevent  either  side  from
being unjustly enriched.
(D) is wrong because: (1) both parties’ contractual duties (not
just  the  painter’s)  are  discharged;  and  (2)  the  painter’s
damages  would  be  measured  by  a  restitution  concept  (value
conferred on the lawyer just before the fire) rather than by a
reliance concept.

CHAPTER 12
MISCELLANEOUS DEFENSES

I.    MISREPRESENTATION

A.  Non-disclosure

1.  Failure to correct other party’s basic mistake

a.    Possession  of  information  by  surreptitious  and  unfair

means

Question  72:  An  heir,  who  knew  nothing  about  horses,
inherited  a  thoroughbred  colt  whose  disagreeable  behavior
made  him  a  pest  around  the  barn.  The  heir  sold  the  colt  for
$1,500 to an experienced racehorse-trainer who knew of the
heir’s  ignorance  about  horses.  At  the  time  of  sale,  the  heir
said  to  the  trainer,  “I  hate  to  say  it,  but  this  horse  is  bad-
tempered and nothing special.” Soon after the sale, the horse
won three races and earned $400,000 for the trainer.

Which of the following additional facts, if established by the
heir, would best support his chance of obtaining rescission of
the sale to the trainer?

(A)  The heir did not know until after the sale that the trainer

was an experienced racehorse-trainer.

(B)  At a pre-sale exercise session of which the trainer knew
that the heir was not aware, the trainer clocked the horse
in  record-setting  time,  far  surpassing  any  previous
performance.

(C)  The horse was the only thoroughbred that the heir owned,
and  the  heir  did  not  know  how  to  evaluate  young  and
untested racehorses.

(D)  At the time of the sale, the heir was angry and upset over
an incident in which the horse had reared and thrown a
rider.

Answer 72: Choice (B) is correct. Normally, even where one
party knows that the other is making a mistake about a basic
assumption,  the  former’s  non-disclosure  of  the  relevant  fact
will  not  constitute  a  misrepresentation  that  the  relevant  fact

317

does  not  exist.  But  the  non-disclosure  will  constitute  a
misrepresentation that the mistaken fact does not exist — and
will be grounds for rescission — if it amounts to a “failure to
act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards
of  fair  dealing.”  Rest.  2d,  §161(b).  Where  the  non-discloser
learns  of  the  true  fact  through  improper  or  questionable
means, the court is likely to find a failure to act in good faith.
Here, since the horse was the heir’s property at the time the
trainer  secretly  timed  it  in  the  exercise  session,  the  case  is
analogous to the Restatement’s example of a mining company
trespassing  on  the  seller’s  property  to  gain  mineral-deposit
information;  a  court  would  therefore  likely  conclude  that  the
trainer’s timing session pushed the entire transaction into the
bad-faith category.

(A) is wrong because the trainer’s undisclosed experience as
a trainer would not alter the general principle that one party’s
failure  to  disclose  that  the  other  party  is  making  a  mistake
about  a  basic  assumption  does  not  constitute  the  sort  of
misrepresentation  that  would  allow  the  “innocent”  party  to
rescind.  The  test  is  whether  the  non-discloser’s  failure  to
correct  the  other’s  mistake  constitutes  bad  faith,  and  a  court
would be unlikely to conclude that the non-discloser’s failure
to  disclose  his  own  credentials  pushes  the  entire  situation
over into the bad-faith column.
(C)  is  wrong  because  the  party  with  superior  knowledge  is
normally  not  required  to  correct  the  other  party’s  mistake
about  even  a  basic  assumption  where  that  assumption  is  due
to the latter’s lack of diligence or knowledge — “if the other
[party]  is  indolent,  inexperienced  or  ignorant,  or  if  his
judgment  is  bad  or  he  lacks  access  to  adequate  information,
his  adversary  is  not  generally  expected  to  compensate  for
these  deficiencies.  A  buyer  of  property,  for  example,  is  not
ordinarily  expected  to  disclose  circumstances  that  make  the
property more valuable than the seller supposes.” Rest. 2d, §
161, Comment d.
(D) is wrong because it cites a completely irrelevant fact. The
trainer  had  no  obligation  to  correct  what  he  knew  to  be  the
heir’s mistake as to a basic assumption, unless the failure to
correct  amounted  to  bad  faith  or  a  failure  to  follow

318

reasonable  standards  of  fair  dealing.  The  fact  that  the
mistaken  party  was  angry  does  not  push 
the  more
knowledgeable  party’s  lack  of  disclosure  into  the  bad-faith
category,  especially  where  (as  here)  there  is  nothing  to
indicate that the more-knowledgeable party even knew about
the other’s anger.

Question 73: A landholder was land-rich by inheritance but
money-poor,  having 
losses  on  bad
investments,  but  still  owned  several  thousand  acres  of
unencumbered  timberland.  He  had  a  large  family,  and  his
normal, fixed personal expenses were high. Pressed for cash,
he advertised a proposed sale of standing timber on a choice
2,000-acre tract. The only response was an offer by a logger,
the owner of a large, integrated construction enterprise, after
inspection of the advertised tract. The logger offered to buy,
sever,  and  remove  the  standing  timber  from  the  advertised
tract at a cash price 70% lower than the regionally prevailing
price for comparable timber rights. The landholder, by then in
desperate  financial  straits  and  knowing  little  about  timber
values,  signed  and  delivered  to  the  logger  a  letter  accepting
the offer.

commercial  background  and  the  commercial  needs  of  the
particular  parties,  the  contract  is  so  one-sided  as  to  be
unconscionable.  Here,  there  are  two  facts  that  support  an
unconscionability  claim:  (1)  a  purchase  price  that  was  70%
below  market;  and  (2)  the  landholder’s  lack  of  knowledge
about timber values. It is not certain that the landowner will
prevail  with  the  unconscionability  claim  as  the  basis  for
rescission, but of the four choices it is the only one that could
plausibly work for him.

(A) is wrong because the logger has not behaved in bad faith.
A  buyer  who  proposes  a  very  below-market  price  has  not
thereby behaved in bad faith. In any event, “bad faith” in some
abstract  sense  is  not  grounds  for  canceling  a  transaction  to
which  the  other  party  has  agreed,  in  the  absence  of
misrepresentation or unconscionability.

(B) 
logger  did  not  make  a
the 
misrepresentation, which is necessary for equitable estoppel.
Equitable estoppel is a doctrine applied by courts of equity to
allow one party to rescind when the other misrepresents a fact
on  which  the  first  party  justifiably  and  detrimentally  relies.
Here,  the  landholder  would  have  to  show  that  the  logger
misrepresented  something,  and 
the
landholder could make that showing.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  landholder  can’t  show  coercion.
The  defense  of  duress  will  rarely  be  successful  where  one
party merely takes economic advantage of the other’s pressing
need to enter the contract. For the concept of duress to work
for  the  landholder,  he  would  have  to  argue  that  the  logger
coerced him into entering the contract. There are no facts here
to show coercion — all the logger did was take advantage of
the landholder’s scant knowledge about timber values and his
pressing  need  for  immediate  money,  and  that’s  not  the  same
thing as coercion.

two-year-old,  became 

Question  1:  Kathy,  a 
ill  with
meningitis.  Jim  and  Joan,  her  parents,  were  members  of  a
group that believed fervently that if they prayed enough, God
would not permit their child to die. Accordingly, they did not
seek medical aid for Kathy and refused all offers of such aid.
They prayed continuously. Kathy died of the illness within a
week.

Jim  and  Joan  are  charged  with  murder  in  a  common-law
jurisdiction.
Their best defense to the charge is that
(A)  they did not intend to kill or to harm Kathy.
(B)  they were pursuing a constitutionally protected religious

belief.

(C)    Kathy’s  death  was  not  proximately  caused  by  their

conduct.

(D)  they neither premeditated nor deliberated.

322

Answer 1: The correct choice is (A). Murder is the unlawful
killing  of  another  person  with  malice  aforethought.  “Malice
aforethought” is a term of art that encompasses any of several
mental  states,  mainly  the  intent  to  kill,  the  intent  to  cause
serious  bodily  harm,  reckless  indifference  to  the  value  of
human  life,  and  intent  to  commit  one  of  a  specified  list  of
dangerous felonies (e.g., robbery or burglary). The defendants
did not possess any of the required mental states. They come
closest  to  having  had  “reckless  indifference  to  the  value  of
human  life”  (also  known  as  a  “depraved  heart”),  but  most
courts  hold  that  that  mental  state  exists  only  when  the
defendant  consciously  disregards  a  known  risk — since  the
defendants honestly (although perhaps unreasonably) believed
that God would protect their child, a court would be unlikely
to  find  that  they  had  the  requisite  conscious  disregard  of  a
high risk of harm.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  all  persons  must  obey  criminal
prohibitions  requirements  of  general  applicability,  even  if
obeying that rule of law offends the person’s religious beliefs.
Therefore,  even  if  the  defendants’  religious  beliefs  required
them to avoid seeking medical assistance for a sick child, they
did not have a constitutionally-protected right to do so.

(C) is wrong, because even though Jim and Joan did not take
any affirmative action that proximately contributed to Kathy’s
death,  their  failure  to  act  did  proximately  cause  the  death.
Since parents  have  a  duty  to  act  affirmatively  to  care  for  a
minor child, their failure to act could expose them to criminal
liability. And their failure to act would be deemed “conduct.”

(D)  is  wrong  because  not  all  forms  of  common-law  murder
require premeditated or deliberative conduct. For example, a
death  that  is  caused  by  reckless  indifference  to  the  value  of
human  life  might  well  occur  without  any  premeditation  or
deliberative  conduct.  In  any  event,  the  defendants’  failure  to
seek  medical  attention  probably  was  “premeditated”  or
“deliberative,”  in  the  sense  that  their  rejection  of  offers  of
medical help indicates that they devoted conscious thought to
whether to seek such help.

II.   MENS REA

A.  “Knowingly”

1.  Knowledge of attendant circumstances

Question  2:  Dart  is  charged  with  the  statutory  offense  of
“knowingly  violating  a  regulation  of  the  State  Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board” and specifically that he knowingly
violated  regulation  number  345-90  issued  by  the  State
Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. That regulation prohibits
the sale of alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of
18 and also prohibits the sale of any alcoholic beverage to a
person over the age of 17 and under the age of 22 without the
presentation  of  such  person’s  driver’s  license  or  other
identification  showing  the  age  of  the  purchaser  to  be  18  or
older.

The  evidence  showed  that  Dart  was  a  bartender  in  a  tavern
and  sold  a  bottle  of  beer  to  a  person  who  was  17  years  old
and  that  Dart  did  not  ask  for  or  see  the  purchaser’s  driver’s
license or any other identification.

Which of the following, if found by the jury, would be of the
most help to Dart?

(A)  The purchaser had a driver’s license that falsely showed

his age to be 21.

(B)    Dart  had  never  been  told  he  was  supposed  to  check
identification  of  persons  over  17  and  under  22  before
selling them alcohol.

(C)  Dart did not know that the regulations classified beer as

an alcoholic beverage.

(D)    Dart  mistakenly  believed  the  purchaser  to  be  24  years

old.

Answer 2: Choice (D)  is  correct.  Dart  did  not  “knowingly”
violate a regulation if he did not think that the requirements of
the regulation were required to be applied in the situation he
encountered.  Dart  believed  the  purchaser  was  24  years  old;
therefore, he did not think that either of the provisions of the
regulation  applied:  the  prohibited  sale  to  a  purchaser  under
18 and the requirement to check identification of a purchaser
over the age of 17 and under the age of 22. The fact that his
belief was mistaken is not relevant.

(This  scenario  is  different  from  the  “ignorance  of  the  law”
scenario  incorrectly  asserted  in  choices  (B)  and  (C).  Here,
defendant is mistaken about the underlying facts the existence
of  which  trigger  the  law,  not  mistaken  about  what  type  of
conduct  the  law  prohibits.  And  a  defendant  who  is  mistaken
about  the  underlying  facts  the  existence  of  which  make  the
conduct  illegal  won’t  be  said  to  have  “knowingly”  violated
the statute, according to the prevailing interpretation.)

(A) is wrong because, even though the purchaser had a false
driver’s  license  showing  him  to  be  21,  Dart  never  asked  to
see the license, and he was therefore in violation of the part
of the regulation requiring that he do so (for purchasers over
the  age  of  17  and  under  the  age  of  22).  The  fact  that  the
purchaser  was  indeed  of  age  and  could  purchase  the  beer
does  not  affect  a  finding  that  Dart  “knowingly”  violated  that
part of the regulation.

(B) is wrong because it’s argument is based on the theory that
ignorance  of  what  conduct  the  law  proscribes  can  be  a
defense.  It  can’t — as  a  general  principle,  if  the  defendant
intended to perform act X, and act X is proscribed by a valid
statute,  it’s  not  a  defense  that  the  defendant  didn’t  know  that
performing  act  X  was  against  the  law.  In  other  words,  the
maxim “ignorance of the law is no excuse” is for the most part
a true statement.

(C)  is  wrong  for  the  same  reason  as  (B) — it  amounts  to  a
defense  based  on  defendant’s  ignorance  that  a  particular  act
(selling beer to a minor) was against the law.

2.  “Practically certain” standard for unintended effects

Question 3: A man decided to steal a car he saw parked on a
hill.  When  he  got  in  and  started  the  engine,  the  car  began
rolling  down  the  hill.  The  man  quickly  discovered  that  the
car’s brakes did not work. He crashed through the window of
a store at the bottom of the hill.
The  man  was  charged  with  larceny  of  the  car  and  with  the
crime of knowingly damaging the store’s property. At trial, the
judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man
was  guilty  of  larceny  of  the  car  and  that  the  damage  to  the
store  was  the  result  of  that  larceny,  then  it  should  also  find

325

him guilty of malicious damage of property.

The man was convicted on both counts. On appeal, he argued
that  the  conviction  for  malicious  damage  of  property  should
be  reversed  because  the  instruction  was  not  a  correct
statement of the law.

Should the man’s conviction be affirmed?

(A)    Yes,  because  his  intent  to  steal  the  car  provides  the

necessary mental element.

(B)  Yes, because he was committing a felony.
(C)    No,  because  the  instruction  wrongly  described  the

necessary mental state.

(D)  No, because it would violate double jeopardy to convict

the man of two crimes for a single act.

if  he  was  found 

Answer  3:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  man  could  be
convicted  only 
to  have  “knowingly
damag[ed]”  the  store’s  property.  For  the  man  to  have
knowingly damaged the property, the jury would have to have
found,  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  that  he  either  intended  to
damage  the  property,  or  knew  that  such  damage  was
practically  certain  to  result  from  his  actions.  See,  e.g.,
Model  Penal  Code  §  2.02(b)(i):  “A  person  acts  knowingly
with respect to a material element of an offense when: . . . (ii)
if  the  element  involves  a  result  of  his  conduct,  he  is  aware
that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a
result.”  Here,  the  judge’s  instruction  is  asserting  that  the
man’s  mere  act  of  stealing  the  car  constitutes  “knowingly
damaging” the store’s property as long as the damage resulted
from the theft. For the instruction to be correct, it would have
to  require  “concurrence” — that  is,  it  would  have  to  require
that the guilty act and the guilty state of mind occurred at the
same time. The guilty act here is the theft, which occurred at
the  moment  the  man  started  the  engine  and  caused  the  car  to
make  a  small  movement.  So  the  guilty  state  of  mind  would
have  to  be  present  at  that  same  moment.  At  that  start-the-
engine-and-first-move-the-car moment, the man did not know
that  damage  to  the  store  was  “practically  certain”  to  occur,
because the man had not yet even discovered that the brakes
didn’t work (and if the brakes had worked, the damage to the

326

store  wouldn’t  have  occurred).  So  the  requirement  of
concurrence wouldn’t be satisfied. At the later moment when
the  man  learned  the  brakes  didn’t  work,  he  may  then  have
known  that  damage  to  the  store  was  practically  certain  to
occur,  but  by  that  moment  the  larceny  had  already  occurred,
and  it  was  too  late  for  the  requirement  of  concurrence  to  be
satisfied.

(A) is wrong because it ignores the requirement that the man
have  “knowingly  damaged”  the  store’s  property.  To  have
knowingly damaged the store’s property, the man would have
had  to  know  (at  the  time  he  stole  the  car  by  causing  it  to
move)  that  damage  to  the  store  was  practically  certain  to
occur.  And  he  didn’t  have  that  knowledge  at  that  time,  as  is
further described in Choice (C).

the 

(B) is wrong because the man’s commission of a felony is not
enough  to  supply  the  intent  necessary  for  the  crime  of
knowingly  damaging 
store’s  property.  To  have
“knowingly” damaged property, the man must have known, at
the relevant time, that damage to the property was “practically
certain”  to  occur.  And  the  judge’s  instruction  made  the
relevant time be the time at which the man committed larceny
(since that’s the time of the voluntary act, which is what has to
have temporal concurrence with the guilty state of mind). As
is  further  described  in  Choice  (C),  at  the  moment  of  larceny
the man did not yet know that damage to the store’s property
was practically certain.

(D)  is  wrong  because  double  jeopardy  does  not  preclude
conviction  of  two  distinct  crimes  with  separate  legal
elements. Blockburger v. United States (1932).
If one of the two crimes was a lesser included offense of the
other, then conviction of both would violate double jeopardy.
But here, the elements are clearly different. For instance, the
mental state needed here for larceny was an intent to steal the
property  of  another  (the  car)  by  taking  it  away,  whereas  the
mental  state  needed  for  malicious  damage  to  the  store’s
property was either intent to cause that damage, or knowledge
that  the  damage  was  practically  certain  to  occur.  Therefore,
neither  crime  is  defined  in  a  way  that  makes  it  a  lesser
included  offense  of  the  other,  so  double  jeopardy  doesn’t

327

apply.

B.  Vicarious liability

1.  Constitutionality

a.  D has no control over offender

Question  4:  Morten  was  the  general  manager  and  chief
executive officer of the Woolen Company, a knitting mill.

Morten delegated all operational decision making to Crouse,
the supervising manager of the mill. The child labor laws in
the jurisdiction provide, “It is a violation of the law for one to
employ  a  person  under  the  age  of  17  years  for  full-time
labor.” Without Morten’s knowledge, Crouse hired a number
of 15- and 16-year-olds to work at the mill full time. He did
not  ask  their  ages  and  they  did  not  disclose  them.  Crouse
could  have  discovered  their  ages  easily  by  asking  for
identification, but he did not do so because he was not aware
of  the  law  and  believed  that  company  policy  was  to  hire
young people.
If the statute is interpreted to create strict liability and Morten
is convicted of violating it, his contention that his conviction
would violate the federal Constitution is

(A)  correct, because it is a violation of due process to punish

without a voluntary act.

(B)    correct,  because  criminal  liability  is  personal  and  the
Woolen  Company  is  the  employer  of  the  children,  not
Morten.

(C)  incorrect, because regulatory offenses are not subject to

due process limitations.

(D)    incorrect,  because  he  was  in  a  position  to  exercise
control  over  the  hiring  of  employees  for  Woolen
Company.

Answer  4:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Crouse  was  acting  as
Morten’s  agent  in  running  Woolen  Company.  If  a  defendant
principal had no control over whether the agent committed the
crime,  it  might  indeed  be  a  violation  of  the  defendant’s  due
process rights for him to be convicted based on a vicarious-
liability theory; but where the principal had control over the
agent’s  conduct,  vicarious  liability  does  not  pose  a  due

328

process  or  other  constitutional  issue.  Since  Morten  (the
principal) had the ability to exercise control over how Crouse
(the  agent)  ran  the  company,  he  may  constitutionally  be  held
responsible for the criminal acts Crouse performed within the
scope of his agency.

(A)  is  wrong  because  due  process  allows  punishment  of  an
individual (call him “D”) who has not committed a voluntary
act  in  some  circumstances.  For  instance,  if  D  had  the  legal
right  and  responsibility  to  supervise  the  behavior  of  another
person  (call  him  “A”)  and  did  not  do  so,  it  would  not  be  a
violation  of  due  process  for  the  state  to  impose  vicarious
criminal  responsibility  on  D.  Therefore,  vicarious  criminal
liability  of  an  employer  or  supervisor  for  failing  to  prevent
the  criminal  acts  of  a  worker  in  furtherance  of  the  job  does
not violate due process.

(B) is incorrect because hiring the children was a criminal act
on  the  part  of  Crouse.  Therefore  Morten,  who  was  Crouse’s
supervisor  and  could  have  prevented  him  from  doing  such
hiring, can be held criminally liable for Crouse’s crimes that
were committed within the scope of his employment.
(C)  is  wrong  because  due  process  limits  do  apply  even  to
regulatory offenses. For example, some courts have found that
imprisonment for unknowingly committing regulatory offenses
can violate due process.

CHAPTER 2
RESPONSIBILITY

I.    THE INSANITY DEFENSE

A.  Tests for insanity

1.  M’Naghten “right from wrong” rule

Question 5: A mental patient suffered from the delusion that
he  was  a  special  agent  of  God.  He  frequently  experienced
hallucinations  in  the  form  of  hearing  divine  commands.  The
mental  patient  believed  that  God  told  him  several  times  that
the local Roman Catholic bishop was corrupting the diocese
into heresy, and that the bishop should be “done away with.”
The  patient,  a  devout  Catholic,  conceived  of  himself  as  a
religious martyr. He knew that shooting bishops for heresy is
against  the  criminal  law.  He  nevertheless  carefully  planned
how he might kill the bishop. One evening the patient shot the
bishop,  who  was  taken  to  the  hospital,  where  he  died  two
weeks later.

The mental patient told the police he assumed the institutions
of society would support the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and he
expected  to  be  persecuted  for  his  God-inspired  actions.  A
psychiatrist  examined  the  patient  and  found  that  he  suffered
from  schizophrenic  psychosis,  that  in  the  absence  of  this
psychosis he would not have shot the bishop, and that because
of  the  psychosis  the  patient  found  it  extremely  difficult  to
determine whether he should obey the specific command that
he  do  away  with  the  bishop  or  the  general  commandment
“Thou shalt not kill.” The patient was charged with murder. If
the patient interposes an insanity defense and the jurisdiction
in which he is tried has adopted only the M’Naghten test of
insanity, then the strongest argument for the defense under that
test is that
(A)    The  patient  did  not  know  the  nature  of  the  act  he  was

performing.

(B)  The patient did not know that his act was morally wrong.
(C)    The  patient  did  not  know  the  quality  of  the  act  he  was

performing.

330

(D)  The patient’s acts were the product of a mental disease.
Answer 5: Choice (B) is correct. Here, it’s key to appreciate
what  the  “best”  defense  will  be:  It  must  be  the  one  that
correctly states the M’Naghten Rule and best corresponds to
the facts given. Under M’Naghten, a person is legally insane
if, at the time of committing the crime, he was acting under a
defect of reason, caused by a disease of the mind, such that he
either (1) was unable to understand the nature and quality of
his actions, OR (2) if he did know the nature and quality, he
was unable to know that what he was doing was wrong. The
“wrong” referred to here is interpreted by most courts to refer
to  legally  wrong,  not  morally  wrong;  however,  some  courts
hold that the inability to know one’s act was morally wrong is
enough to declare one insane. Under the facts in this question,
you  aren’t  told  which  of  these  two  interpretations  the
jurisdiction  follows — “legal”  wrong  or  “moral”  wrong.
Since  there’s  a  chance  it  could  follow  the  “moral”  wrong
option, the mental patient could be exonerated due to insanity:
It’s clear that he could not appreciate the moral wrongness of
his action even though he fully realized it was legally wrong.
Since there’s a possibility that (B) could exonerate the mental
patient,  and  the  other  three  options  do  not  offer  strong
defenses, (B) is the best response.
(A)  is  wrong  because  although,  if  it  were  true,  it  would
exonerate  the  mental  patient  under  the  M’Naghten  Rule,  it
does  not  apply  to  these  facts.  As  described  in  (B)  above,
under M’Naghten, a person is legally insane if, at the time of
the crime, he was acting under a defect of reason, caused by a
disease  of  the  mind,  such  that  he  either  was  unable  to
understand the nature and quality  of  his  actions,  or  if  he  did
know  the  nature  and  quality,  he  was  not  able  to  know  that
what he was doing was wrong. Choice (A), in using the term
“nature,”  is  referring  to  the  “nature  and  quality”  part  of
M’Naghten; thus, this choice is theoretically correct in stating
that  the  inability  to  know  the  nature  of  the  act  performed
would  exonerate  the  patient.  However,  the  nature  of  the  act
performed  refers  to  the  physical  consequences  of  the  act — 
for  instance,  a  man  who  hit  his  wife  in  the  head  with  a
baseball bat, believing her head was a baseball, would have

331

the  requisite  inability  to  understand.  This  is  clearly  not
applicable  to  these  facts,  because  the  patient  knew  that
shooting  the  bishop  was  likely  to  kill  him.  Thus,  the  patient
did  appreciate  the  nature  and  quality  of  his  act,  and  the
statement in Choice (A) cannot exonerate him.

(C)  is  wrong  because  although  if  it  were  true  it  would
exonerate  the  mental  patient  under  the  M’Naghten  Rule,  it
does  not  apply  to  these  facts.  Choice  (C)  is  essentially  a
restatement  of  Choice  (A)  and  is  incorrect  on  the  same
grounds. Choice (C), in using the term “quality,” is referring
to the “nature and quality” part of M’Naghten,  which  refers
to  the  physical  consequences  of  the  act.  This  is  clearly  not
applicable to these facts, because the mental patient knew that
shooting  the  bishop  was  likely  to  kill  him,  meaning  that  he
appreciated the physical consequences of his act.

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  is  not  a  correct  statement  of  the
M’Naghten  Rule — thus,  even  if  the  mental  patient’s  acts
were the product of a mental disease, as this choice states, he
would  not  be  exonerated  under  M’Naghten.  The  rule  (D)
states  is  the  Durham  Rule,  which  is  followed  by  a  small
minority  of  jurisdictions.  Under  M’Naghten,  even  if  the
patient’s  acts  were  the  product  of  a  mental  disease,  he
wouldn’t  be  exonerated  unless  he  also  satisfied  either  the
“nature  and  quality”  or  “knowledge  of  wrong”  element,  as
described in Choice (B) above.

II.   INTOXICATION

A.  Voluntary intoxication

Question  6:  During  an  altercation  between  two  men  at  a
company  picnic,  the  victim  suffered  a  knife  wound  in  his
abdomen  and  the  defendant  was  charged  with  assault  and
attempted  murder.  At  his  trial,  the  defendant  seeks  to  offer
evidence  that  he  had  been  drinking  at  the  picnic  and  was
highly intoxicated at the time of the altercation.

jurisdiction 

In  a 
the  common-law  rules
concerning  admissibility  of  evidence  of  intoxication,  the
evidence of the defendant’s intoxication should be

that  follows 

332

(A)  admitted without limitation.
(B)  admitted subject to an instruction that it pertains only to

the attempted murder charge.

(C)  admitted subject to an instruction that it pertains only to

the assault charge.
(D)  excluded altogether.
Answer 6: The correct choice is (A). This choice is correct
because  evidence  of  intoxication  might  negate  the  requisite
intent for both crimes. When the defendant is charged with a
crime  that  requires  purpose  or  intent,  evidence  of  voluntary
intoxication  may  be  offered  to  establish  that  the  intoxication
may  have  prevented  the  defendant  from  formulating  the
requisite  intent.  Each  of  the  crimes  charged  here  requires  a
particular  intent.  Assault  requires  an  intent  to  cause  bodily
harm.  Attempted  murder  requires  an  intent  to  kill.  If  the
defendant  was  intoxicated,  this  fact  might  (would  not
necessarily,  but  might)  indicate  that  he  could  not  or  did  not
form the required intent. Therefore, the evidence is relevant to
both  crimes,  and  must  be  admitted  unconditionally  (i.e.,  not
subject to any limiting instruction).

(B), (C), and (D) are all wrong because they are inconsistent
with the above analysis.

CHAPTER 3
JUSTIFICATION AND EXCUSE

I.    DURESS

A.  Not available for homicide

Question  7:  Smith  joined  a  neighborhood  gang.  At  a  gang
meeting,  as  part  of  the  initiation  process,  the  leader  ordered
Smith to kill Hardy, a member of a rival gang. Smith refused,
saying  he  no  longer  wanted  to  be  part  of  the  group.  The
leader,  with  the  approval  of  the  other  members,  told  Smith
that he had become too involved with the gang to quit and that
they  would  kill  him  if  he  did  not  accomplish  the  murder  of
Hardy. The next day Smith shot Hardy to death while Hardy
was sitting on his motorcycle outside a restaurant.
Smith  is  charged  with  first-degree  murder.  First-degree
murder  is  defined  in  the  jurisdiction  as  the  intentional
premeditated killing of another. Second-degree murder is all
other murder at common law.

If  Smith  killed  Hardy  because  of  the  threat  to  his  own  life,
Smith should be found

(A)  not guilty, because of the defense of duress.
(B)  not guilty, because of the defense of necessity.
(C)  guilty of first-degree murder.
(D)  guilty of second-degree murder.
Answer  7:  The  correct  choice  is  (C).  Smith  should  be
convicted of first degree murder because he intentionally and
with  premeditation  killed  Hardy.  From  the  facts  given,  it  is
clear  that  Smith  intended  to  kill  Hardy  when  he  shot  him.  In
addition, since Smith waited a full day between being told to
kill Hardy and doing so, he had a reasonable amount of time
to deliberate. If a defendant has a reasonable amount of time
to  think  about  the  decision  to  kill,  the  homicide  will  be
considered  premeditated,  supporting  a  conviction  of  murder
in  the  first  degree.  (As  discussed  below  in  the  analysis  of
choices (A) and (B), no defense applies to this situation.)

334

(A)  is  wrong  because  what  we  care  about  is  whether  the
duress defense will work, and it won’t, for two reasons. First,
duress  is  generally  not  allowed  as  a  defense  when  the
defendant is charged with the intentional killing of another — 
i.e. murder or voluntary manslaughter. Second, Smith was not
in  imminent  danger  when  he  killed  Hardy,  and  duress  only
applies  when  the  defendant  believes  that  if  he  does  not
commit  a  criminal  act  he  will  suffer  immediate  or  imminent
death or serious bodily injury. The gang leader certainly made
threats  that  Smith  could  reasonably  believe  would  have
resulted in his own death. However, there is no indication in
the  facts  given  that  Smith  was  in  fear  of  imminent  death;  at
worst,  Smith  had  fear  of  some  future  harm,  which  is
insufficient to support a claim of duress.

(B) is wrong for two reasons. First, necessity is generally not
allowed as a defense when the defendant is charged with the
intentional  killing  of  another — i.e.,  murder  or  voluntary
manslaughter.  Second,  the  gang  leader’s  threat  was  not  the
type  of  influence  to  which  the  defense  of  necessity  applies.
This question illustrates the distinction between the defenses
of duress and necessity. Duress is available when the threat of
harm  comes  from  the  threat  or  use  of  force  by  a  third  party.
Necessity  is  available  when  the  threat  of  harm  is  caused  by
non-human events — for example, sickness or weather. Since
the  gang  leader  is  a  person,  rather  than  a  force  of  nature,
necessity is not a proper defense.

(D) is wrong because, although Smith has met all the elements
required for a conviction of second-degree murder, he would
be  more  properly  convicted  of  the  more  serious  first-degree
murder, as discussed in (C) above.

II.   SELF-DEFENSE

A.  Degree of force

1.  Deadly force

a.  Can’t use deadly force to prevent non-serious harm

Question  8:  Ralph  and  Sam  were  engaged  in  a  heated
their  favorite
discussion  over 

the  relative  merits  of 

335

professional football teams when Ralph said, “You have to be
one  of  the  dumbest  persons  around.”  Sam  slapped  Ralph.
Ralph  drew  a  knife  and  stabbed  Sam  in  the  stomach.  Other
persons  then  stepped  in  and  stopped  any  further  fighting.
Despite the pleas of the other persons, Sam refused to go to a
hospital or to seek medical treatment. About two hours later,
he  died  as  the  result  of  a  loss  of  blood.  Ralph  was  charged
with 
trial,  medical  evidence
established that if Sam had been taken to a hospital, he would
have survived.

the  murder  of  Sam.  At 

At  the  end  of  the  case,  Ralph  moves  for  a  judgment  of
acquittal  or,  in  the  alternative,  for  an  instruction  on  the
elements of voluntary manslaughter.

The court should

(A)   grant the motion for acquittal.
(B) 

  deny  the  motion  for  acquittal,  but  instruct  on
manslaughter  because  there  is  evidence  of  adequate
provocation.

(C)  deny both motions, because Ralph failed to retreat.
(D)  deny both motions, because malice may be proved by the
intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the
body.

Answer  8:  Choice  (C)  is  incorrect,  because  the  issue  of
retreat would never even arise. Before the duty to retreat (in a
jurisdiction  imposing  it)  could  ever  make  a  difference,  D
would have to be entitled to use deadly force in self-defense.
Here,  Sam’s  slap  neither  caused  Ralph  serious  bodily  harm
nor gave Ralph reason to fear serious bodily harm in the near
future.  Therefore,  Ralph  was  not  privileged  to  respond  with
deadly force. Since the duty to retreat (even if the jurisdiction
imposes  it)  only  makes  a  difference  where  defendant  would
otherwise be entitled to use deadly force, Ralph’s loss of the
motion  of  acquittal  couldn’t  be  due  to  his  “fail[ure]  to
retreat.” (It’s not clear what the best answer is — all the other
three choices were accepted by the examiners.)

B.  Effect of mistake

1.  Reasonable

336

 
Question  9:  While  walking  home  one  evening,  Harold,  an
off-duty  police  officer,  was  accosted  by  Jones,  a  stranger.
Jones had been drinking and mistakenly thought Harold was a
man  who  was  having  an  affair  with  his  wife.  Intending  to
frighten Harold but not to harm him, Jones pulled out a knife,
screamed  obscenities,  and  told  Harold  he  was  going  to  kill
him. Frightened and reasonably believing Jones was going to
kill  him  and  that  using  deadly  force  was  his  only  salvation,
Harold  took  out  his  service  revolver  and  shot  and  killed
Jones. Harold is charged with murder.

Harold’s claim of self-defense should be

(A)    sustained,  because  Harold  reasonably  believed  Jones
was  planning  to  kill  him  and  that  deadly  force  was
required.

(B)    sustained,  because  the  killing  was  in  hot  blood  upon

sufficient provocation.

(C)    denied,  because  Jones  did  not  in  fact  intend  to  harm
Harold  and  Harold  was  incorrect  in  believing  that  he
did.

(D)  denied, because Harold was not defending his home and
had  an  obligation  to  retreat  or  to  repel  with  less  than
deadly force.

Answer  9:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Harold’s  claim  of  self-
defense is valid because he reasonably believed that his life
was in danger and that the use of deadly force was required to
save  his  own  life.  Self-defense  is  a  complete  defense  to  a
charge  of  murder.  For  the  defense  to  be  applicable,  the
defendant  must  believe  that  he  had  to  use  force  to  protect
himself  from  the  danger.  The  belief  must  meet  both  an
objective  and  a  subjective  test:  The  defendant  must  actually
believe that he was in danger (subjective) and that belief must
be  reasonable  (objective).  Here,  we  are  told  that  Harold
reasonably believed that Jones was going to kill him, so both
the objective and subjective tests are satisfied.

Even  if  a  claim  of  self-defense  is  valid,  the  court  must  still
determine if the degree of force used was excessive. One may
only  use  deadly  force  in  self-defense  if  one  reasonably
believes  that  (1)  the  attack  carries  the  threat  of  death  or

337

serious bodily harm, and (2) nothing less than deadly force is
likely  to  repel  the  threat.  Here,  Harold’s  reasonable  belief
was that Jones intended to kill him, and Harold believed that
deadly  force  would  be  his  “only  salvation,”  so  these  two
requirements regarding deadly force are satisfied.

The fact that Harold was mistaken (but reasonably so) on this
point does not deprive him of the defense of self-defense, or
of the right to use deadly force.

(B) is wrong because “provocation” is not an element of self-
defense.  Self-defense  is  a  complete  defense,  which  applies
when a defendant uses a reasonable level of force in response
to a reasonably feared threat. Provocation, on the other hand,
is  a  partial  defense  which  applies  when  a  defendant  uses
force  because  something  causes  him  to  lose  self-control.  A
defense  based  on  provocation  would  not  be  used  if  the
defendant  was  entitled,  as  Harold  is  here,  to  assert  the
complete defense of self-defense.

(C) is wrong because, when analyzing self-defense claims, it
is  the  defendant’s  state  of  mind,  not  the  victim’s  that  is
important. The issue is not whether Jones actually intended to
harm Harold, but rather whether Harold was reasonable in his
(admittedly mistaken) belief that James intended to attack.
(D)  is  wrong  because  the  obligation  to  retreat  is  only
triggered  when  the  defendant  believes  that  he  may  retreat  to
complete  safety.  Here,  Harold  believed  that  his  “only
salvation”  was  the  use  of  deadly  force,  which  indicates  that
he  did  not  believe  that  retreat  was  possible.  Even  if  Harold
were  mistaken  in  his  belief,  so  long  as  that  mistake  was
reasonable, he had no obligation to retreat. (Note: Only some
states  require  that  a  defendant  retreat  before  using  deadly
force  in  self-defense.  And,  by  the  way,  retreat  is  never
required before the use of non-deadly force in self-defense.)

III.  ENTRAPMENT

A.  “Predisposition” test

Question 10: Kingsley was prosecuted for selling cocaine to
an  undercover  police  agent.  At  his  trial,  he  testified  that  he

338

only  sold  the  drugs  to  the  agent,  whom  Kingsley  knew  as
“Speedy,”  because  Speedy  had  told  him  that  he  (Speedy)
would be killed by fellow gang members unless he supplied
them  with  cocaine.  The  prosecution  did  not  cross-examine
Kingsley.  As  rebuttal  evidence,  however,  the  prosecutor
introduced  records,  over  Kingsley’s  objection,  showing  that
Kingsley  had  two  prior  convictions  for  narcotics-related
offenses. The court instructed the jury concerning the defense
of entrapment and added, also over Kingsley’s objection but
in accord with state law, that it should acquit on the ground of
entrapment only if it found that the defendant had established
the  elements  of  the  defense  by  a  preponderance  of  the
evidence. Kingsley was convicted.

On appeal, Kingsley’s conviction should be

(A)  reversed, because it was an error for the court to admit
the  evidence  of  his  prior  convictions  as  substantive
evidence.

(B)    reversed,  because  it  was  a  violation  of  due  process  to
impose on the defense a burden of persuasion concerning
entrapment.

(C)  reversed, for both of the above reasons.
(D)  affirmed, because neither of the above reasons constitutes

a ground for reversal.

Answer  10:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Neither  of  the  reasons
listed in (A) and (B) constitutes a ground for reversal.

(A)  is  wrong  because  where  entrapment  is  at  issue,  the
prosecution  must  prove  that  the  defendant  was  disposed  to
commit  the  criminal  act  prior  to  first  being  approached  by
government  agents.  This  may  be  done  by  showing  the
defendant’s  prior  crimes  that  are  related  to  or  similar  to  the
instant  offense.  (Generally,  evidence  of  a  person’s  other
crimes  or  acts  is  inadmissible  to  show  action  in  conformity
with  the  person’s  character.  FRE  404(b).  However,  such
other-crimes evidence would be admissible here to show that
a defense [entrapment] now being asserted lacks merit.)
(B) is wrong because entrapment is an affirmative defense. A
defendant  may  constitutionally  be  required  to  bear  both  the
burden  of  coming  forward  with  some  evidence  as  to  an

339

affirmative  defense,  and  the  burden  of  non-persuasion  (by  a
preponderance of the evidence) as to such a defense.

(C)  is  wrong  because  neither  of  the  reasons  constitutes  a
ground for reversal, as explained in (A) and (B).

340

CHAPTER 4
ATTEMPT

I.    IMPOSSIBILITY

A.  Factual impossibility

1.  Not accepted

a.  Combined with accomplice liability

Question 11: A woman promised to pay $10,000 to a hit man
if he would kill her neighbor in any manner that could not be
traced  to  her.  The  hit  man  bought  a  gun  and  watched  the
neighbor’s  house  for  an  opportunity  to  shoot  him.  One
evening,  unaware  of  the  hit  man’s  presence,  the  neighbor
tripped  as  he  was  walking  toward  his  house,  falling  and
hitting  his  head  against  the  front  steps.  Believing  that  the
neighbor  was  unconscious,  the  hit  man  ran  over  to  him  and
shot him twice in the chest.

When the woman learned of the neighbor’s death, she paid the
hit  man  $10,000.  A  medical  examiner  determined  that  the
neighbor was already dead when the hit man shot him.
The  crimes  below  are  listed  in  descending  order  of
seriousness.

What is the most serious crime for which the woman properly
could be convicted?

(A)  Murder.
(B)  Attempted murder.
(C)  Conspiracy.
(D)  Solicitation.
Answer 11:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Let’s  start  with  murder.
One theory under which the woman might be guilty of murder
would be on an accomplice theory, that she aided and abetted
the hit man to commit murder — if he is substantively liable
for murder, so is she as his accomplice. But the hit man is not
guilty of murder, because, as a factual matter, he did not cause
the  neighbor’s  death.  (You  cannot  cause  the  death  of  another
by taking an action after the other is already dead.) Since the

341

hit man is not guilty of murder, the woman can’t be guilty of it
either, on an accomplice theory. What about the woman’s guilt
of murder as a principal? Well, she can’t be guilty of murder
unless  she  played  some  causal  role  in  bringing  about  the
death; since the neighbor would have died in exactly the same
way  if  the  woman  had  not  recruited  the  hit  man,  the  woman
was not a cause-in-fact of the death, and therefore cannot be
liable for murder as a principal.

Now,  what  about  attempted  murder?  The  woman  has
certainly  tried  to  bring  about  a  murder,  and  has  caused
various  acts  to  occur  towards  fulfillment  of  that  objective
(e.g., the hit man’s lying in wait). So she is guilty of attempted
murder  unless  some  special  doctrine  helps  her.  The  only
doctrine that’s even of remotely plausible help to her here is
the  defense  of  “factual  impossibility” — can  either  the
woman or the hit man succeed with the argument that “It was
impossible  for  us  to  kill  the  neighbor  since  he  was  already
dead, making an attempted-murder conviction improper”? The
answer is no: The factual impossibility defense is rejected by
virtually every modern court. That is, where a defendant had
an intent to commit crime X, and took actions that would have
led to a completed crime X if external reality had been as the
defendant  mistakenly  believed  it  to  be,  the  fact  that  the
defendant could never have succeeded in completing crime X
because  external  reality  made  such  success  impossible  does
not  constitute  a  defense.  Clearly  the  hit  man’s  actions  and
intent  here  were  such  that  had  the  facts  been  as  the  hit  man
believed (i.e., the neighbor was only unconscious, not dead),
the hit man would have been guilty of murder. Therefore, the
hit  man  is  guilty  of  attempted  murder,  and  the  factual
impossibility  defense  won’t  work  to  save  him.  Since  the
woman urged the hit man to take the action he took, and since
the woman, too, had an intent to kill, she is guilty of attempted
murder  on  an  accomplice  theory.  The  factual  impossibility
defense doesn’t work any better for her as an accomplice than
it does for the hit man as a principal.
(A) is wrong because the woman cannot be guilty of murder,
since  the  hit  man  did  not  in  fact  cause  the  neighbor’s  death.
See Choice (B) for further analysis of why this is so.

342

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  woman  can  be  convicted  of
attempted  murder,  which  the  question  tells  us  is  a  more
serious  crime  than  conspiracy.  (But  the  woman  can  also  be
convicted  of  conspiracy  to  commit  murder,  since  she  agreed
with another to try to bring about a murder.)

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  woman  can  be  convicted  of
attempted  murder,  which  the  question  tells  us  is  a  more
serious  crime  than  solicitation.  (But  the  woman  can  also  be
convicted of solicitation, since she tried to persuade another
to commit a crime.)

b.  Robbery cases where V is not intimidated

two 

Question  12:  Robert  walked  into  a  store  that  had  a  check-
cashing  service  and  tried  to  cash  a  $550  check  which  was
payable  to  him.  The  attendant  on  duty  refused  to  cash  the
check  because  Robert  did  not  have 
forms  of
identification,  which  the  store’s  policies  required.  Robert,
who had no money except for the check and who needed cash
to pay for food and a place to sleep, became agitated. He put
his hand into his pocket and growled, “Give me the money or
I’ll  start  shooting.”  The  attendant,  who  knew  Robert  as  a
neighborhood character. did not believe that he was violent or
had  a  gun.  However,  because  the  attendant  felt  sorry  for
Robert, he handed over the cash. Robert left the check on the
counter and departed. The attendant picked up the check and
found that Robert had failed to endorse it.

                    If Robert is guilty of any crime, he is most likely

guilty of
(A)  robbery.
(B)  attempted robbery.
(C)  theft by false pretenses.
(D)  larceny by trick.
Answer  12:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  For  a  defendant  to  be
convicted  of  attempting  a  particular  substantive  crime,  he
must  have  had  the  intent  to  do  acts  which,  if  they  had  been
carried  out,  would  have  resulted  in  the  commission  of  that
crime. Robert pretended to have a gun and threatened to shoot
the  attendant  if  he  didn’t  hand  over  the  money.  The  fact  that
Robert’s threat was not real (because he didn’t have a gun) or

343

taken  seriously  by  the  attendant  would  not  negate  Robert’s
intent to cause the attendant to be afraid and to cause him to
hand over the money. Therefore, it is possible that he would
be  guilty  of  attempted  robbery.  Although  this  is  not  entirely
clear from the circumstances of the case (he might be able to
defend on the grounds that he wasn’t trying to take “property
of another” since he was giving equal value in the form of the
check),  of  the  choices  given,  this  would  be  the  most  likely
crime he would be guilty of if he were guilty of any crime.

(A) is wrong because property was not taken by using force
or by putting the owner in fear. The elements of robbery are
that (1) property is taken from the person or presence of the
owner;  and  (2)  the  taking  is  accomplished  by  using  force  or
putting  the  owner  in  fear.  A  threat  of  harm  will  suffice.  It  is
not required that the victim be afraid, only that he be placed in
apprehension  of  harm.  However,  since  the  attendant  knew
Robert  as  a  neighborhood  character  and  did  not  believe  that
he  was  violent  or  had  a  gun,  he  was  not  placed  in
apprehension of harm under these circumstances.

(C) is wrong because it is required that the person intend to
defraud  and  that  his  misrepresentation  cause  the  person  to
whom it was made to pass title to the property. The elements
of  the  crime  are:  (1)  a  false  representation  (2)  of  a  material
present or past fact (3) which causes the person to whom it is
made (4) to pass title to (5) his property to the misrepresenter
who (6) knows that his representation is false, and intends to
defraud.  Robert  pretended  to  have  a  gun  and  threatened  to
shoot.  He  did  make  a  misrepresentation  (that  he  had  a  gun),
but  he  intended  to  make  a  transaction,  where  he  would
relinquish his check in return for getting money. The fact that
he  did  not  endorse  the  check  is  not  proof  of  his  intent  to
defraud because it might have been a careless mistake. Also,
his misrepresentation did not cause the attendant to give him
the  cash — the  attendant  knew  he  didn’t  have  a  gun  and
merely felt sorry for him.
(D) is wrong because of the same reasons that Robert is not
guilty of the crime of false pretenses, as discussed in Choice
C.  Robert  did  not  have  the  intent  to  defraud  nor  was  the
property  turned  over  as  a  result  of  the  fact  that  Robert

344

pretended to have a gun and threatened to use it. Larceny by
trick  differs  from  false  pretenses  in  that  it  requires  only  that
possession  has  passed  (not  title)  and  also  requires  that  the
property be converted in some way as to deprive its owner of
much of its utility. It does not apply in this situation.

B.  “True legal” impossibility

1.  Arson on the MBE

Question  13:  Arnold  decided  to  destroy  an  old  warehouse
that he owned because the taxes on the structure exceeded the
income  that  he  could  receive  from  it.  He  crept  into  the
building in the middle of the night with a can of gasoline and a
fuse  and  set  the  fuse  timer  for  30  minutes.  He  then  left  the
building.  The  fuse  failed  to  ignite,  and  the  building  was  not
harmed.

Arson  is  defined  in  this  jurisdiction  as  “The  intentional
burning  of  any  building  or  structure  of  another,  without  the
consent  of  the  owner.”  Arnold  believed,  however,  that
burning  one’s  own  building  was  arson,  having  been  so
advised by his lawyer.

Has Arnold committed attempted arson?

(A)  Yes, because factual impossibility is no defense.
(B)  Yes, because a mistake of law even on the advice of an

attorney is no defense.

(C)  No, because his mistake negated a necessary mental state.
(D)  No, because even if his actions had every consequence he

intended, they would not have constituted arson.

Answer  13:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Arnold  is  not  guilty  of
attempted arson because, even if his actions had their desired
result, a crime would not have been committed. This question
involves the issue of legal impossibility, which applies when
a  defendant  is  mistaken  about  what  type  of  conduct  a  statute
prohibits.  A  defendant  is  not  guilty  of  attempt  when,  had  the
attempt  been  successful,  no  crime  would  have  been
committed,  regardless  of  whether  the  defendant  in  fact
believed  he  was  committing  a  crime.  Although  Arnold
intended to burn the warehouse down, believing that doing so
would  be  a  crime,  had  everything  gone  as  planned,  he  still

345

wouldn’t  have  committed  arson  because  the  statute  specifies
that an owner can’t be guilty of burning his own building.

(A)  is  wrong  because  Arnold’s  mistake  was  about  the  law,
not about a fact. Factual impossibility arises when some fact,
unknown  to  the  defendant,  makes  it  impossible  to  complete
the  crime  that  the  defendant  intended  to  commit.  Factual
impossibility  is  not  accepted  as  a  defense  to  attempt.  For
example,  had  Arnold  believed  the  warehouse  to  belong  to
someone  else  while  it  in  fact  belonged  to  him,  he  would  be
guilty  of  attempted  arson  despite  the  fact  that  had  he
succeeded  in  burning  the  building,  the  completed  act  would
not have been arson. In that example Arnold would be guilty
of attempt because, had the facts been as he believed them to
be, his actions would have been a crime. In the problem itself,
Arnold  was  not  mistaken  about  any  material  fact.  He  knew
that he owned the warehouse and he knew that he was trying
to  burn  it  down.  Therefore  factual  impossibility  is  not  at
issue.

(B) is wrong because, while it is true that mistake of law is
not  a  defense,  Arnold’s  mistake  wouldn’t  help  him  in  any
event.  This  “defense”  is  tried  (unsuccessfully)  by  those  who
have committed a criminal act, but believed their actions not
to have been prohibited, as a means to show they lacked the
mens  rea  to  commit  the  crime.  Arnold’s  situation  is  the
opposite. He believed his act to be a crime when it was not
prohibited  by  the  statute.  Therefore  his  mistake  would  not
tend to negate the mens rea required for arson.

(C)  is  wrong  because  mental  state  is  independent  of  any
outside  factual  or  legal  circumstances.  The  mental  state
required for arson, as defined in the given statute, is intent to
burn. Arnold certainly intended to burn the warehouse, so he
possessed the required mental state to commit arson.

CHAPTER 5
CONSPIRACY

I.    THE CONSPIRATORIAL OBJECTIVE

A.  Substantive liability without “aiding and abetting”

1.  Traditional view

Question  14:  Two  brothers  operated  an  illicit  still.  They
customarily  sold  to  anyone  unless  they  suspected  the  person
of  being  a  revenue  agent  or  an  informant.  One  day  when  the
older brother was at the still alone, he was approached by a
man who asked to buy a gallon of liquor. The man was in fact
a  revenue  officer.  After  the  older  brother  had  sold  him  the
liquor,  the  officer  revealed  his  identity.  The  older  brother
grabbed a pistol from his desk drawer, and shot and wounded
the officer. The older brother had kept the pistol, unbeknownst
to the younger brother, in case someone should try to rob the
still.  After  the  shooting,  other  revenue  agents,  hiding  nearby,
overpowered and arrested the older brother.

Shortly thereafter, the younger brother came on the scene. The
revenue  agents  in  hiding  had  been  waiting  for  him.  One  of
them  approached  him  and  asked  to  buy  liquor.  The  younger
brother  was  suspicious  and  refused  to  sell.  The  revenue
agents nevertheless arrested him.

The  two  brothers  were  charged  with  conspiracy  to  violate
revenue  laws,  illegal  selling  of  liquor,  and  battery  of  the
officer.

On the charge of battery, which statement concerning the two
brothers is true?
(A)  Neither is guilty.
(B)  Both are guilty.
(C)    The  older  brother  is  guilty  but  the  younger  one  is  not,
because the conspiracy had terminated with the arrest of
the older one.

(D)    The  older  brother  is  guilty  but  the  younger  one  is  not,
because the older one’s act was outside the scope of the
conspiracy.

347

Answer  14:  The  correct  choice  is  (D).  The  key  here  is
identifying the scope of the conspiracy. Under the facts given,
the older brother is clearly liable for battery, since a battery
is the unlawful application of force to the person of another,
resulting in bodily injury or offensive touching. There was no
excuse  or  justification  for  his  doing  so.  However,  if  the
conspiracy to make and sell liquor had a scope large enough
to include the shooting, the younger brother would be liable
as well. That’s because at common law, one co-conspirator is
liable  for  any  substantive  crimes  committed  by  another  co-
conspirator,  if  the  crimes  were  “within  the  scope  of  the
conspiracy.”  But  for  this  purpose,  the  scope  of  a  conspiracy
includes  only  crimes  that  (1)  were  committed  in  furtherance
of  the  conspiracy’s  objectives;  and  (2)  were  “natural  and
probable consequences” of the conspiracy, viewed from the
position  of  the  non-committing  conspirator  prior  to  the
commission  of  the  crime  in  question  (i.e.,  crimes  the
commission of which were reasonably foreseeable to the non-
committing conspirator). Here, the goal of the conspiracy was
to make and sell liquor, not to shoot revenue agents. There are
the  younger  brother’s
that  from 
no  facts 
perspective, shooting revenue agents would or might be part
of  the  liquor-selling  venture.  (The  younger  brother  is
similarly  innocent  as  an  aider-and-abetter,  since  he  didn’t
procure,  counsel  or  command  the  older  brother  to  shoot  the
officer; in fact, the younger brother didn’t intend for the older
brother to shoot the officer at all.)

to  suggest 

(A), (B), and (C) are wrong because each is inconsistent with
the above analysis.

II.   PLURALITY

A.  Inconsistent disposition

1.  One is member of protected class

a.  Common-law view

Question 15:  A  young  man,  who  was  18  years  old,  and  his
14-year-old girlfriend, made plans to meet in the young man’s
apartment to have sexual intercourse, and they then carried out

348

their  plan.  The  girlfriend  later  told  her  mother  about  the
incident. The young man was charged with statutory rape and
conspiracy to commit statutory rape.

In  the  jurisdiction,  the  age  of  consent  is  15,  and  the  law  of
conspiracy is the same as at common law. The young man was
convicted  of  both  charges  and  given  consecutive  sentences.
On appeal, he contends that his conspiracy conviction should
be reversed. That conviction should be

(A)  affirmed, because he agreed with his girlfriend to commit

(B) 

the crime.
  reversed,  because  the  girlfriend  could  not  be  a
conspirator to this crime.

(C)    reversed,  because  the  crime  is  one  that  can  only  be
committed  by  agreement  and  thus  Wharton’s  Rule  bars
conspiracy liability.

(D)  reversed, because one cannot conspire with a person too

young to consent.

Answer 15:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Members  of  a  protected
class cannot be members of a conspiracy to commit the crime
that  is  designed  to  protect  that  class  of  people.  At  common
law (as the facts specify to be the relevant law of conspiracy)
if only two people are involved, the person who is not in the
protected class cannot be guilty of criminal conspiracy on the
basis  of  an  agreement  with  a  member  in  the  protected  class,
since  there  must  be  at  least  two  members  of  the  conspiracy
(this  is  the  “plurality”  requirement).  The  girl,  as  a  14-year-
old, was part of the class the statute was designed to protect,
and so could not be a member of a conspiracy to commit the
crime. Because, under these facts, there are only two parties
involved  and  one  could  not  be  a  party  to  a  conspiracy,  the
man  could  not  be  guilty  of  conspiracy  either,  under  the
common-law  approach.  (Under  the  Model  Penal  Code’s
“unilateral”  approach,  by  contrast,  as  long  as  two  people
agreed to commit a crime, the fact that one was a member of
the  protected  class  would  not  prevent  the  other  from  being
convicted.)
(A)  is  wrong  because,  as  described  in  the  analysis  of  (B)
above,  where  two  people  are  charged  with  common-law

349

conspiracy and one is not guilty because she is a member of
the protected class, the other cannot be guilty either.

(C)  is  wrong  because  Wharton’s  Rule  does  not  apply  to
offenses  that  can  possibly  be  committed  by  a  single  person.
Wharton’s Rule says that where an offense is defined so as to
necessarily  require  the  guilty  participation  of  more  than  one
person,  and  no  more  than  the  logically  minimum  number  of
participants  are  involved,  a  charge  of  conspiracy  to  commit
that  offense  cannot  be  brought,  because  every  substantive
violation  would  logically  include  a  conspiracy.  (Example:
There  can  be  no  conspiracy  to  commit  adultery,  if  just  one
man and one woman are charged.) However, statutory rape is
not an offense so defined that more than one person’s knowing
and  guilty  participation  is  required.  It’s  true  that  two  people
must  be  “involved,”  but  by  definition  one  of  those  two  is  a
minor who cannot give consent. In other words, the over-age
person  can  be  (and  usually  is)  the  only  person  guilty  of  the
substantive crime of statutory rape. Therefore, the crime is not
the  type  of  “two  or  more  participants  logically  required”
crime to which Wharton’s Rule applies.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  answer  incorrectly  states  the  law.
Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to
accomplish  some  criminal  or  unlawful  purpose.  The  man’s
conviction  should  be  reversed,  but  not  for  the  reason  given,
which  is  a  misstatement  of  the  law.  One  can  conspire  with
someone too young to consent, provided the person below the
age  of  consent  meets  the  mental  requirements  for  the
substantive  crime  that  is  the  object  of  the  conspiracy.  For
instance,  the  man  could  conspire  with  the  girl  to  commit
robbery  or  some  other  crime.  What  the  man  could  not  do  is
conspire  with  the  girl  to  commit  statutory  rape,  because  the
girl is a member of the class the law is intended to protect (as
described in the analysis of Choice (B)).

b.  Modern/Model Penal Code “unilateral” view

Question  16:  A  foreign  diplomat  discovered  that  a  small
person could enter a jewelry store by crawling through an air
vent.  The  diplomat  became  friendly  with  a  woman  in  a  bar
who  he  believed  was  small  enough  to  crawl  through  the  air
vent. Without telling her that he was a diplomat, he explained

350

how she could get into the jewelry store. She agreed to help
him  burglarize 
their
conversation and reported it to the police. Shortly thereafter,
the  police  arrested  the  diplomat  and  the  woman.  Both  were
charged with conspiracy to commit burglary.

Before trial, the diplomat moved to dismiss the charge against
him on the ground that he was entitled to diplomatic immunity.
The  court  granted  his  motion.  The  woman  then  moved  to
dismiss the conspiracy charge against her.

The  jurisdiction  has  adopted  the  Model  Penal  Code  version
of conspiracy.

Should the woman’s motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge
against her be granted?

(A)  No, because the diplomat’s defense does not negate any

element of the crime.

(B)  No, because the woman was not aware of the diplomat’s

Answer  16:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Model  Penal  Code  §

defendant  but  not  by  two  or  more  persons,  adopts  a

“unilateral”

like 
immunity  here,  does  not  prevent
conviction of a co-conspirator who does not benefit from that
defense. See Lafave, Criminal Law, § 6.5(g).)
(B)  is  wrong  because  it  cites  an  irrelevant  fact.  The  woman

would  not  be  entitled  to  dismissal  even  if  she  knew  of  the
diplomat’s  status,  because  the  diplomat’s  capacity  to  be
convicted  of  the  crime  would  be  irrelevant  in  a  jurisdiction
that adopted a unilateral view of conspiracy. And the M.P.C.
adopts a unilateral view.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  M.P.C.’s  definition  of
conspiracy.  Section  5.03(1)  of  the  M.P.C.,  which  defines
conspiracy,  does  not  require  that  there  be  two  guilty
participants.  All  that  the  M.P.C.  requires  is  that  (1)  there  be
two  persons  who  appear  to  agree  to  pursue  a  criminal
objective,  and  (2)  the  particular  defendant  being  prosecuted
have  a  guilty  mind.  So  if  X  and  Y  appear  to  agree  to  a
conspiratorial  objective,  the  fact  that  Y  has  some  personal
defense  (such  as  the  diplomatic  immunity  here)  does  not
prevent  X  from  being  convicted,  as  long  as  X  meets  all  the
requirements for conspiracy (e.g., a guilty mind, and absence
of any personal defense).

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  “but-for”  factor  that  it  cites  is
irrelevant.  The  woman  can  properly  be  convicted  because,
regardless of the diplomat’s immunity, she agreed to commit a
crime.  See  M.P.C.  §  5.03(1).  The  fact  that  the  diplomat’s
conduct was a but-for cause of the conspiracy is irrelevant. (If
the  diplomat  had  been  acting  as  an  agent  of  the  government,
and  in  order  to  get  a  conviction  for  the  government  had
persuaded the woman to agree to a crime that she would not
have  agreed  to  without  the  diplomat’s  suggestion,  then  the
woman  might  have  a  valid  entrapment  defense.  But  there  is
no suggestion in these facts that that’s what happened here.)

III.  PUNISHMENT

A.  Cumulative sentencing allowed

Question 17:  Jackson  and  Brannick  planned  to  break  into  a
federal  government  office  to  steal  food  stamps.  Jackson
telephoned  Crowley  one  night  and  asked  whether  Crowley
wanted  to  buy  some  “hot”  food  stamps.  Crowley,  who
understood  that  “hot”  meant  stolen,  said,  “Sure,  bring  them
right over.” Jackson and Brannick then successfully executed
their scheme. That same night they delivered the food stamps

352

to Crowley, who bought them for $500. Crowley did not ask
when  or  by  whom  the  stamps  were  stolen.  All  three  were
arrested. Jackson and Brannick entered guilty pleas in federal
court  to  a  charge  of  larceny  in  connection  with  the  theft.
Crowley was never charged with anything.

If Jackson and Brannick are charged with conspiracy to steal
the  stamps  in  the  state  court,  they  should,  on  the  evidence
stated, be found

(A)    not  guilty,  because  the  charge  of  conspiracy  is  a  lesser

included offense in the charge of larceny.

(B)    not  guilty,  because  to  charge  them  with  conspiracy  after
their  conviction  of  larceny  would  constitute  double
jeopardy.

(C)  not guilty, because the state prosecution is barred by the

prosecution in federal court.

(D)    guilty,  because  they  planned  and  conspired  to  steal  the

stamps.

Answer  17:  The  correct  choice  is  (D).  Conspiracy  is  a
distinct offense which is not merged into the crime which is
the  object  of  the  conspiracy.  A  conspiracy  requires  an
agreement between at least two people, an intent to enter into
such  an  agreement,  and  the  intent  to  achieve  the  agreement’s
unlawful objective (or, at common law, a lawful ultimate act
to be done unlawfully). The conspiracy is complete once the
agreement is entered into, at common law (the modern rule is
to require an act in furtherance of the conspiracy); it does not
encompass the ultimate act.

(A)  is  wrong  for  the  same  reason  that  (D)  is  correct:
Conspiracy  is  a  distinct  offense  that  is  not  merged  into  the
crime which is the object of the conspiracy. If you chose this
response,  it  could  be  because  you  confused  conspiracy  with
attempt. Attempt is merged into the completed crime, so that
the  accused  can  only  be  convicted  of  attempt  OR  the
completed offense, but not both. But conspiracy is a separate
and distinct offense, which doesn’t merge into the completed
crime.
(B)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  law,  and  arrives  at  an
incorrect result: In fact, conspiracy is a separate and distinct

353

offense from the crime which is the object of the conspiracy.
Thus, being tried for it after pleading guilty to larceny would
not  be  considered  double  jeopardy.  Double  jeopardy  only
attaches when two prosecutions meet two requirements: They
must be based  on  the  same  conduct,  AND  proof  of  the  facts
needed  for  one  must  necessarily  include  proof  of  all  facts
needed  for  the  other.  Conspiracy  focuses  on  the  agreement
aspect, and is complete once the agreement is made; larceny
requires  the  actual  larcenous  taking  of  the  stamps  (without
requiring any prior agreement between the participants).

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  law.  The  facts  in  this
problem  suggest  that  the  latter  prosecution  would  not  be
barred. A state prosecution after a federal prosecution would
be forbidden under two circumstances: double jeopardy, or a
kind  of  collateral  estoppel  because  the  earlier,  federal
prosecution was resolved in defendant’s favor due to a factual
finding  that  would  bar  a  later  conviction  in  state  court  (e.g.,
an alibi was upheld). Neither of these exist under these facts.
Larceny and conspiracy are two separate and distinct crimes,
and  the  proof  that  would  be  necessary  for  them  would  be
largely  different.  Double  jeopardy  would  not  attach  to  the
federal larceny conviction (see the discussion of this point in
Choice  (B)  above),  and  there  is  nothing  under  these  facts  to
issue  precludes
suggest 
conviction in the later state prosecution.

CHAPTER 6
ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY AND
SOLICITATION

I.    ACCOMPLICES — THE ACT REQUIREMENT

A.  Liability for aiding and abetting

1.  Words alone

Question 18: A young man met the victim, whom he hated, in
the  street  outside  a  bar  and  began  to  push  him  around.  The
defendant, an older man who also hated the victim, stopped to
watch  and  shouted  to  the  young  man,  “Kill  him.”  The  young
man stabbed and killed the victim.
On a charge of murdering the victim, the defendant is

(A)  not guilty, because his words did not create a “clear and

present danger” not already existing.

(B)    not  guilty,  because  a  person’s  mere  presence  and  oral
encouragement, whether or not he has the requisite intent,
will not make him guilty as an accomplice.

(C)  guilty, because, with the intent to have the young man kill
the  victim,  the  defendant  shouted  encouragement  to  the
young man.

(D)    guilty,  because  he  aided  and  abetted  the  murder  through
his mere presence plus his intent to see the victim killed.
Answer  18:  The  correct  choice  is  (C).  One  is  liable  for  a
crime,  as  an  accomplice,  if  he  procures,  counsels,  or
commands the commission of that crime. Naturally, this would
require that he intend that the crime be committed. Here, the
defendant’s  liability  would  rest  on  his  statement  “Kill  him.”
Intent could be established by presumption, since a person of
sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of his actions is
presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of
his actions. Here, the defendant encouraged the young man to
kill the victim, so it could be said that the defendant intended
that the young man kill the victim. Furthermore, his statement
the
would  be  considered  counseling  or  commanding 

355

commission of the crime of murder. As a result, the defendant
will be liable as an accomplice for murder.

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  arrives  at  the  wrong  result,  and  it
applies the wrong rule to these facts. The “clear and present
danger” test is the test used to determine the validity, for First
Amendment  purposes,  of  a  law  designed  to  forbid  advocacy
of  unlawful  conduct.  It  provides  that  advocacy  can  only  be
forbidden  if  its  aim  is  to  produce  or  incite  imminent  illegal
action,  and  it  is  likely  to  produce  or  incite  such  action.
Whether  the  defendant’s  speech  is  protected  by  the  First
Amendment is not the issue here; instead, the issue is whether
the  defendant  can  be  held  liable  for  murder  for  encouraging
the young man to kill the victim. Since A does not apply the
correct rule, and, beyond that, arrives at the wrong result, it’s
wrong.

(B)  is  wrong  because  it’s  too  broad.  Given  the  requisite
intent, “mere presence and oral encouragement” are sufficient
to make the defendant guilty as an accomplice. An accomplice
is one who procures, counsels, or commands the commission
of  a  crime.  Choice  (B)  asserts  that  “mere  presence  and  oral
encouragement”  are  insufficient  to  make  one  liable  as  an
accomplice;  however,  under  the  definition  of  accomplice,
or
encouragement  would 
“commanding,”  and  so,  if  accompanied  by  an  intent  that  the
person being encouraged commit the underlying crime, would
create accomplice liability.

“counseling” 

constitute 

(D) is wrong because although it arrives at the correct result,
the  reasoning  it  gives  would  not  be  sufficient  to  hold  the
defendant liable for murder. It’s not the defendant’s presence
and  his  intent  that  make  him  liable,  as  D  suggests — rather,
it’s  his  act  of  encouraging  the  killing  that  makes  him  liable.
Mere  presence  wouldn’t  make  him  liable,  since,  in  general,
one  is  not  obligated  to  act  affirmatively  for  the  benefit  of
others;  furthermore,  his  intent  is  not  sufficient  to  create
liability,  since  intent  is  merely  a  state  of  mind  and,  with
nothing  more,  it’s  not  criminal  (until  it  produces  action  to
bring  about  the  desired  results).  It’s  the  defendant’s  active
encouragement — “Kill him” — that makes him liable.

2.  Failure to intervene

356

Question 19: Bill and Chuck hated Vic and agreed to start a
fight  with  Vic  and,  if  the  opportunity  arose,  to  kill  him.  Bill
and  Chuck  met  Vic  in  the  street  outside  a  bar  and  began  to
push him around. Ray and Tom, who also hated Vic, stopped
to  watch.  Ray  threw  Bill  a  knife.  Tom,  who  made  no  move
and  said  nothing,  hoped  that  Bill  would  kill  Vic  with  the
knife. Chuck held Vic while Bill stabbed and killed him.

On a charge of murdering Vic, Tom is

(A)    not  guilty,  because  mere  presence,  coupled  with  silent

approval and intent, is not sufficient.

(B)  not guilty, because he did not tell Bill ahead of time that

he hoped Bill would murder Vic.

(C)  guilty, because he had a duty to stop the killing and made

no attempt to do so.

(D)    guilty,  because  he  was  present  and  approved  of  what

occurred.

Answer 19: Choice (A) is correct. Under these facts, Tom has
done  nothing  to  subject  himself  to  liability.  The  most
promising  element  for  liability  is  the  fact  that  he  hoped  Bill
would  kill  Vic.  However,  even  though  he  hoped  that  Bill
would kill Vic, all that demonstrates is that Tom had a state of
mind  that,  with  nothing  more,  is  not  criminal.  His  failure  to
aid  Vic  would  not  subject  him  to  liability  because  the  law
imposes no general duty to act affirmatively for the benefit of
the  absence  of  some  special  pre-existing
others, 
relationship  between  the  defendant  and  the  victim  (e.g.,
defendant’s  negligence  created  the  peril,  or  a  special
relationship  mandates  affirmative  acts  [parent  and  child,  for
instance]). Liability for murder would have required that Tom
do  something — either  helping  to  plan  Vic’s  murder,  or
aiding  it  in  some  other  way — to  make  him  liable  under  a
conspiracy  or  accomplice  theory.  Under  these  facts,  no  such
action exists.

in 

(B) is wrong because although it arrives at the correct result,
the reasoning it offers would not exonerate Tom. This choice
suggests that Tom could only be liable if he told Bill ahead of
time  that  he  hoped  Bill  would  murder  Vic.  This  is  both  too
narrow and too broad a statement of the applicable law. First,

357

merely  stating  “I  hope  you  kill  Vic”  might  not  be  enough  to
make  Tom  liable,  if  he  didn’t  plan  the  killing  with  Bill
(conspiracy) or aid in any way (accomplice liability). (If the
“I  hope  you  kill  .  .  .”  statement  amounted  to  active
encouragement, and helped bring about the killing, that might
be enough for accomplice liability; but a mere statement on a
prior  occasion,  without  any  showing  of  a  causal  link  to  the
actual  killing,  wouldn’t  be  enough.)  Second,  prior
encouragement isn’t the only way Tom could be liable; had he
encouraged  Bill  at  the  scene  of  the  crime  (e.g.,  by  shouting
“Kill  him”  at  the  pivotal  moment),  he  would  be  liable  for
murder as an accomplice.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  arrives  at  an  incorrect  result,  and
misstates the law. As a general rule, an individual has no duty
to act affirmatively for the benefit of others. Although certain
relationships  between  the  defendant  and  the  one  in  peril
change this (e.g., defendant’s negligence created the peril, or
a special relationship mandates affirmative acts [parent-child,
for  instance]),  no  such  facts  exist  in  this  question.  Since  no
duty  to  aid  exists,  and  Tom  did  nothing  to  plan  or  aid  in
committing the killing, he cannot be liable for murder.

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  arrives  at  an  incorrect  result,  and
misstates the law. In order to be found guilty of murder, Tom
would  have  to  undertake  some  type  of  activity — be  it
planning  or  aiding  in  the  killing.  Mere  presence  and  tacit
approval are insufficient for liability as a conspirator or as an
accomplice. Presence is not sufficient for liability, since, as a
general rule, the law imposes no duty to act affirmatively for
the  benefit  of  others.  Even  coupling  presence  with  tacit
approval  is  insufficient,  since  approval  is  a  mere  state  of
mind which, with nothing more, is not criminal.

II.   GUILT OF THE PRINCIPAL

A.  Conviction of principal for use of innocent agent

Question  20:  Grace,  while  baby-sitting  one  night,  noticed
that Sam, who lived next door, had left his house but that the
door did not close completely behind him. Grace said to Roy,
the 11-year-old boy she was baby-sitting with, “Let’s play a

358

game. You go next door and see if you can find my portable
television  set,  which  I  lent  to  Sam,  and  bring  it  over  here.”
Grace knew that Sam had a portable television set and Grace
planned  to  keep  the  set  for  herself.  Roy  thought  the  set
belonged  to  Grace,  went  next  door,  found  the  television  set,
and carried it out the front door. At that moment, Sam returned
home and discovered Roy in his front yard with the television
set.  Roy  explained  the  “game”  he  and  Grace  were  playing.
Sam took back his television set and called the police.

Grace is

(A)    not  guilty  of  larceny  or  attempted  larceny,  because  Roy

did not commit any crime.

(B)    not  guilty  of  larceny  but  guilty  of  attempted  larceny,
because she never acquired possession of the television
set.

(C)  guilty of larceny as an accessory to Roy.
(D)  guilty of larceny by the use of an innocent agent.
Answer 20: Choice (D) is correct. Larceny is the: (1) taking,
and  (2)  carrying  away,  of  the  (3)  tangible  property,  (4)  of
another, (5) by trespass or without consent, (6) with the intent
to steal it. Anyone who intentionally acts through an innocent
agent  is  classified  as  a  principal.  Grace  is  guilty  of  larceny,
even  though  she  herself  did  not  take  the  television  set.  She
knowingly  created  a  mistake  of  fact  in  the  mind  of  Roy,  and
intentionally  induced  him  to  commit  acts  satisfying  the  first
five  elements  of  the  crime  of  larceny.  Since  Roy  was  an
innocent  agent  who  acted  at  the  behest  of  Grace,  Roy’s  acts
will  be  ascribed  to  Grace  as  if  she  had  done  them  herself.
Grace  herself  satisfies  the  sixth  requirement  (intent  to  steal
the item). Therefore, Grace is guilty of larceny.

(A) is wrong because as an innocent agent of Grace’s, Roy’s
actions are imputed to Grace. It’s true that Roy did not commit
any crime. But as an innocent agent, his acts are ascribed to
the  principal.  Therefore,  his  own  innocence  is  irrelevant  to
whether  Grace  is  guilty.  See  the  analysis  in  Choice  (D)
above.
(B)  is  wrong  because  Grace’s  innocent  agent  acquired
possession.  When  a  person  intentionally  causes  an  innocent

359

agent  to  perform  an  act,  the  agent’s  act  is  attributed  to  the
principal. So once Roy took and carried away possession of
the  set,  this  act  is  ascribed  to  Grace  as  if  she  had  done  it
herself.  Therefore,  it’s  not  accurate  to  say,  as  this  choice
does, that Grace “never acquired possession.”

(C)  is  wrong  because  Roy  was  not  guilty  of  larceny,  and
Grace is a principal, not an accessory. A principal is one who
with the requisite mental state, actually engages in the act or
omission that causes the criminal result. An accessory is one
who aids or counsels a principal in the completion of a crime.
If Roy had been a principal, then Grace would probably have
been an accessory. In this case, however, Grace is not guilty
as  an  accessory,  because  she  was  the  principal.  Roy  acted
without criminal intent after being misled by Grace. Therefore
(as explained more fully in the analysis of Choice (D) above),
Roy  was  an  innocent  agent  and  Grace  a  principal  in  this
crime.

HOMICIDE AND OTHER CRIMES
AGAINST THE PERSON

I.    MURDER — GENERALLY

A.  Intent-to-kill murder

1.  Ill-will unnecessary

Question  21:  Suffering  from  painful  and  terminal  cancer,
Willa  persuaded  Harold,  her  husband,  to  kill  her  to  end  her
misery.  As  they  reminisced  about  their  life  together  and
reaffirmed  their  love  for  each  other,  Harold  tried  to
discourage  Willa  from  giving  up.  Willa  insisted,  however,
and finally Harold held a gun to her head and killed her.
The  most  serious  degree  of  criminal  homicide  of  which
Harold can be legally convicted is

(A)  no degree of criminal homicide.
(B)  involuntary manslaughter.
(C)  voluntary manslaughter.
(D)  murder.
Answer  21:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Intent-to-kill  murder
requires that the defendant have the desire to bring about the
death of another. Harold intended to kill Willa, held a gun to
her head, and succeeded in killing her. He is guilty of murder.

There is no exception in the doctrine of common-law murder
for “mercy killings.”
Choices (A), (B), and (C) are wrong for the reason that (D) is
right — this is murder.

B.  Intent-to-do-serious-bodily-injury murder

1.  “Serious bodily injury” defined

Question 22: At a party for coworkers at Defendant’s home,
Victim  accused  Defendant  of  making  advances  toward  his
wife. Victim and his wife left the party. The next day at work,
Defendant saw Victim and struck him on the head with a soft-

drink bottle. Victim fell into a coma and died two weeks after
the incident.

This jurisdiction defines aggravated assault as an assault with
any  weapon  or  dangerous  implement  and  punishes  it  as  a
felony.  It  defines  murder  as  the  unlawful  killing  of  a  person
with  malice  aforethought  or  in  the  course  of  an  independent
felony.

Defendant may be found guilty of murder

(A)    only  if  the  jury  finds  that  Defendant  intended  to  kill

Victim.

(B)  only if the jury finds that Defendant did not act in a rage

provoked by Victim’s accusations.

(C)  if the jury finds that Defendant intended either to kill or to

inflict serious bodily harm.

(D)  if the jury finds that the killing occurred in the course of

an aggravated assault.

Answer  22:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Defendant  can  be
convicted  of  murder  if  he  intended  either  to  kill  or  inflict
serious  bodily  harm  when  he  hit  Victim  with  the  soft-drink
bottle. Murder is the unlawful killing of another person with
malice  aforethought.  “Malice  aforethought”  is  a  term  of  art
that encompasses several mental states, including the intent to
kill and the intent to cause serious bodily harm. Therefore, if
the jury finds that Defendant intended either to kill Victim or
to inflict serious bodily harm to Victim, then Defendant would
have had the requisite mens rea to be found guilty of murder.

(A) is wrong because it is too restrictive. While it is true that
intent  to  kill  is  one  mental  state  that  can  support  a  murder
conviction, it is not the only one. As discussed above, several
other  mental  states  are  included  in  “malice  aforethought.”
Since Choice (A) states that “Defendant may be found guilty
of murder only if the jury finds that Defendant intended to kill
Victim”  it  improperly  omits  the  possibility  of  conviction
based on a different mental state.
(B)  is  wrong  because  it  is  an  incomplete  statement  of  the
“heat of passion” defense. A defendant who acted in the heat
of  passion  when  he  killed  may  be  entitled  to  have  his  crime
reduced from murder to voluntary manslaughter. But “heat of

362

passion” will result in a conviction of voluntary manslaughter
rather than murder only if four conditions have been met: (1)
the  defendant  acted  in  response  to  a  provocation  that  would
have  caused  a  reasonable  person  to  lose  self-control  (an
objective test); (2) the defendant did, in fact, act while in the
“heat  of  passion”  (a  subjective  test);  (3)  there  was  no  time
between the provocation and the act for a reasonable person
to  “cool  off”  (objective);  and  (4)  the  defendant  did  not,  in
fact,  “cool  off”  (subjective).  Here,  even  if  the  jury  were  to
accept that Defendant acted in a rage brought on by Victim’s
provocation,  only  the  subjective  elements  would  have  been
proven.  Defendant  would  still  have  to  show  that  Victim’s
accusations  were  enough  to  make  a  reasonable  person  lose
his  self  control  (unlikely)  and  that  the  full  day  that  elapsed
between  the  accusations  and  the  attack  was  an  insufficient
amount  of  time  for  a  reasonable  person  to  cool  off  (very
unlikely). Since Choice (B) omits the subjective elements of
the partial defense, it is an incorrect statement of the law.

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  is  an  inaccurate  application  of  the
felony-murder  rule.  The  felony-murder  rule  states  that  if  a
defendant,  in  the  process  of  committing  certain  dangerous
felonies,  kills  another  person,  he  is  guilty  of  murder.  The
mens rea required to commit the underlying felony is used to
supply  the  mental  state  required  for  murder.  However,  in
order for the felony-murder rule to apply, the felony must be
independent  of 
this  case,  Defendant’s
aggravated  assault  with  the  soft-drink  bottle  was  a  lesser
included  offense  in  the  homicide,  and  can  therefore  not  be
used  as  the  underlying  felony  for  purposes  of  the  felony-
murder rule.

the  killing.  In 

C.  “Reckless indifference to value of human life” or “depraved

heart” murder

Question 23: Phillips bought a new rifle and wanted to try it
out  by  doing  some  target  shooting.  He  went  out  into  the
country  to  an  area  where  he  had  previously  hunted.  Much  to
his  surprise,  he  noticed  that  the  area  beyond  a  clearing
contained several newly constructed houses that had not been
there  before.  Between  the  houses  there  was  a  small
playing.
playground  where 

children  were 

several 

363

Nevertheless, Phillips nailed a paper target to a tree and went
to  a  point  where  the  tree  was  between  himself  and  the
playground.  He  then  fired  several  shots  at  the  target.  One  of
the shots missed the target and the tree and hit and killed one
of the children in the playground.

Phillips  was  convicted  of  murder.  He  appealed,  contending
that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction of
murder.

The appellate court should

(A)    affirm  the  conviction,  as  the  evidence  is  sufficient  to

support a conviction of murder.

(B)    reverse  the  conviction  and  remand  for  a  new  trial,
because the evidence is not sufficient for murder but will
support a conviction of voluntary manslaughter.

(C)    reverse  the  conviction  and  remand  for  a  new  trial,
because the evidence is not sufficient for murder but will
support a conviction of involuntary manslaughter.
(D)    reverse  the  conviction  and  order  the  case  dismissed,
because  the  evidence  is  sufficient  only  for  a  finding  of
negligence  and  negligence  alone  cannot  support  a
criminal conviction.

Answer 23:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  A  defendant  is  guilty  of
murder if he has acted with reckless indifference to the value
of human life. (Cf. MPC § 201.2(1)(b).) Phillips deliberately
shot in the direction of the playground. Although Phillips did
not intend to shoot into the playground (he was aiming for the
target),  the  fact  that  he  put  the  target  in  between  himself  and
the  playground  (where  several  children  were  playing)  is
enough to show that he had a reckless indifference to human
life (sometimes called a “depraved heart”).
(B)  is  wrong  because,  in  order  to  be  guilty  of  voluntary
manslaughter, it is required that the defendant either (1) acted
in response to a provocation that would be sufficient to cause
a  reasonable  person  to  lose  his  self-control;  or  (2)  made  an
unreasonable  mistake  about  the  need  for  self-defense.  The
facts  presented  here  don’t  fall  within  either  of  these
scenarios.
(C)  is  wrong  because  Phillips’  intent  was  more  than  just

364

reckless.  Shooting  into  the  path  of  a  small  playground
demonstrates  an  extreme  indifference  to  the  value  of  human
life,  which  will  suffice  for  murder  (as  further  discussed  in
(A)  above).  Therefore,  this  choice’s  statement  that  the
evidence is “not sufficient for murder” is incorrect.

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  falsely  asserts  that  the  evidence
supports only a finding of negligence. In fact, as is explained
in  (A), 
the  evidence  supports  a  finding  of  extreme
indifference  to  the  value  of  human  life,  which  will  in  turn
support a murder conviction.

Question 24:  Jack,  a  bank  teller,  was  fired  by  Morgan,  the
president  of  the  bank.  Jack  decided  to  take  revenge  against
Morgan, but decided against attempting it personally, because
he  knew  Morgan  was  protected  around  the  clock  by  bank
security guards. Jack knew that Chip had a violent temper and
was  very  jealous.  Jack  falsely  told  Chip  that  Chip’s  wife,
Elsie, was having an affair with Morgan. Enraged, Chip said,
“What am I going to do?” Jack said. “If it were my wife, I’d
just  march  into  his  office  and  blow  his  brains  out.”  Chip
grabbed a revolver and rushed to the bank. He walked into the
bank, carrying the gun in his hand. One of the security guards,
believing a holdup was about to occur, shot and killed Chip.

If charged with murder of Chip, Jack should be found
(A)  guilty, based upon extreme recklessness.
(B)  guilty, based upon transferred intent.
(C)  not guilty, because he did not intend for Chip to be shot by

the security guard.

(D)  not guilty, because he did not shoot Chip and he was not

acting in concert with the security guard.

Answer  24:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Jack  should  be  found
guilty of Chip’s murder because he knowingly put Chip into a
situation where Chip was very likely to be shot. Murder is the
unlawful  killing  of  another  person  with  malice  aforethought.
includes  several  mental  states,
“Malice  aforethought” 
including  reckless  indifference  to  the  value  of  human  life.
Reckless  indifference  tends  to  be  found  in  situations  where
the  defendant  was  aware  of  a  very  high  risk  of  death  to  the
victim. Jack was so aware of the risk in this case that he was

365

fearful  to  go  after  Morgan  himself.  Jack  manifested  reckless
indifference  to  the  value  of  Chip’s  life  by  sending  Chip  into
the bank, gun in hand, knowing that the bank was staffed with
armed security guards. Further, Jack’s encouragement was the
legal  cause  of  Chip’s  death  because  the  risk  he  created
(getting  shot  by  a  security  guard)  was  the  actual  means  of
death.

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  is  a  misapplication  of  transferred
intent.  When  a  defendant  intends  a  harmful  result  to  one
victim,  but,  while  trying  to  affect  that  harm,  causes  similar
harm  to  a  different  victim,  the  doctrine  of  transferred  intent
allows the intent to harm the intended victim to be transferred
to  the  harming  of  the  actual  victim.  However,  transferred
intent only applies when the actual result of an act only differs
from the intended result in that a different victim was harmed.
That is, the same action as intended causes the same type of
harm as intended, but to a victim that was unintended. Here,
Jack  intended  that  Chip  would  fire  a  gun,  killing  Morgan.
Thus, Jack’s intent can only be transferred to a victim shot by
Chip. Since it was the security guard who shot Chip, the act
was  fundamentally  different  from  the  one  intended,  so  the
doctrine of transferred intent will not apply.
(C) is wrong because intent is not always required to support
a murder conviction. As discussed above, reckless disregard
for the value of the victim’s life is a sufficient mental state for
murder. Although Jack did not intend for the security guard to
shoot  and  kill  Chip,  he  was  certainly  aware  of  the  high  risk
that it would happen.

(D) is wrong because Jack’s creation of the very high risk to
Chip’s life is sufficient to find him guilty of murder. When the
mens rea  for  murder  is  reckless  indifference  to  the  value  of
the victim’s life, the defendant needs neither to personally kill
the  victim  nor  be  an  accomplice  of  the  killer — so  long  as
Jack created a situation in which he knew Chip would be at
an  unreasonably  high  risk  of  death,  he  can  be  convicted  of
murder.

Question 25:  A  statute  in  the  jurisdiction  defines  murder  in
the  first  degree  as  knowingly  killing  another  person  after
deliberation.  Deliberation  is  defined  as  “cool  reflection  for

366

any length of time no matter how brief.” Murder in the second
degree is defined as “all other murder at common law except
felony-murder.” Felony-murder is murder in the third degree.
Manslaughter is defined by the common law.

At  2  a.m.,  Duncan  held  up  an  all-night  liquor  store  using  an
assault rifle. During the holdup, two police cars with flashing
lights  drove  up  in  front  of  the  store.  In  order  to  create  a
situation  where  the  police  would  hesitate  to  come  into  the
store (and thus give Duncan a chance to escape out the back)
Duncan fired several rounds through the front window of the
store.  Duncan  then  ran  out  the  back  but  upon  discovering
another police car there, surrendered quietly. One of the shots
he  fired  while  in  the  store  struck  and  killed  a  burglar  who
was stealing items from a closed store across the street.

The  most  serious  degree  of  criminal  homicide  Duncan  is
guilty of is

is 

(A)  murder in the first degree.
(B)  murder in the second degree.
(C)  murder in the third degree.
(D)  manslaughter.
Answer  25:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Duncan  has  committed
murder in the second degree because he fired a gun toward an
area where he knew others were located. Murder at common
law 
the  unlawful  killing  of  another  with  “malice
aforethought,” which includes, among other states of mind, a
reckless  indifference  to  the  value  of  human  life  (sometimes
called  a  “depraved  heart”).  Duncan,  knowing  that  police
officers  were  stationed  outside  the  front  of  the  store,  fired
several  times  through  the  front  window.  In  doing  so,  he
demonstrated  a  disregard  for  the  lives  of  those  standing
outside  since  the  gunfire  created  an  obvious  lethal  risk  to
them.  The  fact  that  the  person  actually  killed  by  one  of  the
shots  was  unknown  to  Duncan  is  irrelevant  since  the
“depraved heart” mental state does not require any particular
victim to be in the defendant’s mind at the time of his act.
(A) is wrong because Duncan lacked the required mental state
to  commit  first  degree  murder.  The  statute  that  defines  first
degree murder in this jurisdiction requires that the defendant

367

“knowingly”  kill  another  person.  “Knowingly”  would  be
interpreted to require that the actor either intend a particular
result, or be aware that his act will almost certainly cause that
result.  When  Duncan  fired  his  gun,  he  did  not  specifically
intend  either  to  hit  or  to  kill  anyone,  or  know  with  near-
certainty  that  someone  would  be  killed.  Thus,  it  cannot  be
said  that  Duncan  knowingly  killed  another,  as  required  for
first-degree murder.

(C)  is  wrong  because  felony  murder  is  not  the  most  serious
degree  of  homicide  of  which  Duncan  is  guilty.  As  discussed
above,  Duncan  is  guilty  of  murder  in  the  second  degree,
which  is  a  more  serious  crime  than  felony  murder,  which  is
defined here as murder in the third degree. Duncan is guilty of
felony  murder  because,  during  the  course  of  committing
robbery  (an  independent,  dangerous  felony),  Duncan  caused
the death of another.

(D) is wrong because, as discussed above, Duncan is guilty of
the  more  serious  crime  of  second  degree  murder.  Duncan
would be guilty of involuntary manslaughter because firing a
gun  toward  a  known  group  of  people  was  grossly  negligent,
risking serious bodily harm or death to those standing outside.

Question 26: At a party, a defendant and a victim agreed to
play a game they called “spin the barrel.” The victim took an
unloaded  revolver,  placed  one  bullet  in  the  barrel,  and  spun
the barrel. The victim then pointed the gun at the defendant’s
head  and  pulled  the  trigger  once.  The  gun  did  not  fire.  The
defendant then took the gun, pointed it at the victim, spun the
barrel,  and  pulled  the  trigger  once.  The  gun  fired,  and  the
victim fell over dead.
A statute in the jurisdiction defines murder in the first degree
as  an  intentional  and  premeditated  killing  or  one  occurring
during  the  commission  of  a  common-law  felony,  and  murder
in  the  second  degree  as  all  other  murder  at  common  law.
Manslaughter  is  defined  as  a  killing  in  the  heat  of  passion
upon  an  adequate  legal  provocation  or  a  killing  caused  by
gross  negligence.  The  most  serious  crime  for  which  the
defendant can properly be convicted is
(A)    murder  in  the  first  degree,  because  the  killing  was

368

intentional and premeditated and, in any event, occurred
during commission of the felony of assault with a deadly
weapon.

(B)  murder in the second degree, because the defendant’s act

posed a great threat of serious bodily harm.

(C)    manslaughter,  because  the  defendant’s  act  was  grossly

negligent and reckless.

(D)    no  crime,  because  the  victim  and  the  defendant
voluntarily agreed to play a game and each assumed the
risk of death.

Answer  26:  Choice  (B)  is  correct,  because  the  defendant’s
actions  fit  the  requirements  for  the  “reckless  indifference  to
the value of human life” variety of murder, which is second-
degree murder in this jurisdiction.

The  act  here  cannot  be  first-degree  murder.  It  is  not
“intentional and premeditated killing” murder, because there’s
no evidence that the defendant desired to kill the victim. And
it  can’t  be  “killing  during  the  commission  of  a  common-law
felony”  murder,  because  assault  or  battery  are  generally
that  can’t  be
lesser-included  offenses 
deemed 
bootstrapped  into  felony-murder.  (Indeed,  it’s  not  even  clear
that  assault  or  battery  existed  here,  since  there’s  not  much
evidence  that  the  defendant  had  any  of  the  possible  mental
states for assault or battery — she apparently didn’t desire to
hurt the victim or even cause him fear of bodily harm.)

to  be 

On the other hand, the facts do fit the definition of murder of
the  “extreme  indifference  to  the  value  of  human  life”  (or
“depraved heart”) variety. The defendant has intentionally or
recklessly  disregarded  what  she  knows  is  an  extremely  high
risk  of  death  or  serious  bodily  harm  to  the  victim.  Since
extreme-indifference  murder  is  a  form  of  common-law
murder, and since it doesn’t fall within one of the two types of
first-degree  murder  in  this  jurisdiction  (intent-to-kill  and  in-
the-course-of-a-common-law-felony), it’s second degree.
(A)  is  wrong,  because  the  defendant’s  actions  do  not  fit  the
given  definition  for  first  degree  murder.  See  the  analysis  of
choice B for why this is so.
(C)  is  wrong,  because  the  defendant’s  actions  match  the

369

requirements for second-degree murder, a more serious crime
than  manslaughter.  The  analysis  in  choice  B  shows  why  the
defendant  qualifies  for  extreme-indifference  second-degree
murder.

(D) is wrong, because assumption of risk is a defense in torts
but normally not in criminal law. Consent of the victim is no
defense in criminal law unless the consent negates an element
of  the  offense.  The  victim’s  consent  does  not  negate  an
element of the crime of murder, because murder is defined as
a  killing  under  any  of  several  mental  states,  and  none  of  the
versions of murder is defined to include lack of the victim’s
consent  as  an  element  of  the  crime.  (For  instance,  if  H  kills
his pain-ridden dying wife W at her urging, her consent would
not  be  a  defense  to  a  “mercy  killing”  murder  prosecution  of
H.)

Question  27:  A  motorist,  while  intoxicated,  drove  his  car
through a playground crowded with children just to watch the
children  run  to  get  out  of  his  way.  His  car  struck  one  of  the
children, killing her instantly.

Which  of  the  following  is  the  best  theory  for  finding  the
motorist guilty of murder?
(A)  Transferred intent.
(B)  Felony murder, with assault with a deadly weapon as the

underlying felony.

(C)    Intentional  killing,  since  he  knew  that  the  children  were

there and he deliberately drove his car at them.

(D)  Commission of an act highly dangerous to life, without an
intent to kill but with disregard of the consequences.
Answer 27:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  key  here  is  that  the
defendant  had  no  intent  to  kill  or  cause  a  serious  injury.
Murder  is  an  unlawful  killing  with  malice  aforethought.
“Malice aforethought” is a term of art, and can be satisfied by
various mental states: (1) intent to kill; (2) intent to do serious
bodily  injury;  (3)  intent  to  commit  one  of  various  dangerous
felonies  (producing  felony  murder);  or  (4)  acting  with
reckless  disregard  of  the  value  of  human  life  (producing
“depraved-heart”  murder).  Depraved  heart  murder  occurs
where  Defendant  engages  in  conduct  which,  at  the  least,  a

370

reasonable  person  would  realize  creates  an  extremely  high
degree  of  risk  to  human  life,  and  which  results  in  death.
Choice  (D),  with  its  language  “without  an  intent  to  kill  but
with  disregard  of  the  consequences,”  coupled  with  “an  act
highly dangerous to life,” essentially reflects this rule.

(A) is wrong because it misapplies the doctrine of transferred
intent. The transferred intent doctrine applies where a person
intending  to  commit  a  crime  against  one  person  accidentally
intent  will  be
commits  a  crime  against  another.  His 
“transferred”  from  the  person  he  intended  to  harm  to  the
person  he  actually  harmed  (e.g.,  D  tries  to  shoot  A  to  death
and  instead  kills  B).  What’s  missing  under  these  facts  is  the
defendant’s intent to kill in the first place — he doesn’t intend
to  kill  or  even  injure  anyone.  If  anything,  he  intends  for  the
children to run out of the way and not be injured. Since he has
no criminal intent, it can’t be transferred.

the  felony 

is  wrong  because 

(B) 
is  not  sufficiently
“independent”  from  homicide  to  be  covered  by  the  felony
murder  rule.  The  felony  murder  rule  is  as  follows:  Where  a
killing is committed during the course of certain “dangerous”
felonies  (or  an  attempt  at  such),  the  homicide  is  considered
murder,  even  though  there  is  no  intent  to  kill  or  cause  great
bodily  harm.  Such  “dangerous”  felonies  typically  include
rape, kidnapping, mayhem, arson, robbery, and burglary. The
dangerous  felony  must  be  reasonably  “independent”  of  the
killing. Assault with a deadly weapon would itself require an
intent  to  do  serious  bodily  harm  or  to  kill,  so  the
“independence” required by the felony murder rule would be
lacking.

(C) is wrong because the reasoning it states is insufficient to
convict the defendant of intentional killing. While intentional
killing  is  sufficient  for  murder,  intent  must  be  one  of  two
types:  Either  the  actor  must  consciously  desire  a  result,
regardless  of  the  likelihood  his  conduct  will  cause  it;  or,
alternatively, he must know the result is practically certain to
result from his conduct, regardless of whether he wants it to
happen.  Thus,  under  the  facts  in  this  question,  the  defendant
would  have  to  want  to  kill  the  children,  or  know  he  was
practically certain to kill one if he drove toward them. Thus,

371

(C)  is  incorrect  in  asserting  that  knowing  the  children  were
there and deliberately driving at them would be sufficient to
convict  the  defendant — in  addition,  he’d  have  to  know  that
driving  at  them  would  result  in  one  being  killed.  In  fact,  the
defendant  believes  they  will  run  to  get  out  of  the  way — he
doesn’t know he’s practically certain to kill one.

1.  Great recklessness required

a.  Omission to act

Question 28: Trelawney worked at a day care center run by
the Happy Faces Day Care Corporation. At the center, one of
the young charges, Smith, often arrived with bruises and welts
on his back and legs. A statute in the jurisdiction requires all
day care workers to report to the police cases where there is
probable  cause  to  suspect  child  abuse  and  provides  for
immediate  removal  from  the  home  of  any  suspected  child
abuse  victims.  Trelawney  was  not  aware  of  this  statute.
to  his
Nevertheless,  he  did  report  Smith’s  condition 
supervisor, who advised him to keep quiet about it so the day
care center would not get into trouble for defaming a parent.
About  two  weeks  after  Trelawney  first  noticed  Smith’s
condition, Smith was beaten to death by his father. Trelawney
has  been  charged  with  murder  in  the  death  of  Smith.  The
evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to the above, that the
child  had  been  the  victim  of  beatings  by  the  father  for  some
time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for
the marks that Trelawney had seen. Smith’s mother had been
aware  of  the  beatings  but  had  not  stopped  them  because  she
was herself afraid of Smith’s father.

Trelawney’s best argument that he is NOT guilty of murder is
(A)  he was not aware of the duty-to-report statute.
(B)  he lacked the mental state necessary to the commission of

the crime.

(C)  his omission was not the proximate cause of death.
(D)    the  day  care  corporation,  rather  than  Trelawney,  was
guilty  of  the  omission,  which  was  sanctioned  by  its
supervisory-level agent.

Answer 28: Choice (B) is correct. Violation of a statute might
serve  as  a  basis  for  a  criminal  conviction  if  the  statute

372

imposes upon the defendant a duty of care that the defendant
has not met. The statute clearly imposed upon Trelawney the
duty to report suspected child abuse. In order to be guilty of
murder,  it  must  be  shown  that  a  defendant  had  “malice
aforethought.”  Malice  aforethought  includes  various  mental
states:  intent  to  kill,  intent  to  do  serious  bodily  injury,
reckless  indifference  to  human  life,  or  intent  to  commit  a
felony.  The  only  possible  qualifying  mental  state  here  is
reckless  indifference  to  human  life.  But  since  Trelawney
thought  about  the  abuse  issue,  and  brought  the  issue  to  his
supervisor’s  attention,  he’s  unlikely  to  be  found  to  have
manifested  the  required  reckless  indifference  to  the  value  of
human  life.  In  any  event,  that’s  his  only  plausible  argument
from among those listed.

(A) is wrong because ignorance of the duty to report is not an
excuse. Criminal liability for omissions can arise where there
is  a  statute  imposing  on  the  defendant  a  distinct  duty  to  act.
Here, the statute imposed a duty of care on day care workers
to  report  to  the  police  where  there  is  probable  cause  to
suspect child abuse. Generally, the fact that the defendant did
not  know  that  the  law  imputes  a  legal  duty  in  a  certain
situation will not constitute a defense. Therefore, Trelawney’s
ignorance  of  the  law  is  not  a  good  argument  to  use  in
defending him from a murder charge.
(C) is wrong because Trelawney’s omission was sufficiently
related  to  Smith’s  death.  It  is  required  that  the  act  (in  this
case, omission) and the harm were sufficiently related that the
act is a proximate cause of the harm. Criminal law generally
insists  upon  a  substantially  closer  connection  between  the
defendant’s act and the ensuing harm, than that of tort law. An
act is the proximate cause if it is “not too remote or accidental
in  its  occurrence  to  have  a  [just]  bearing  on  the  actor’s
liability or on the gravity of his offense.” M.P.C. § 2.03(2)(b).
Since a report of the earlier abuse by Trelawney would likely
have induced the state to remove Smith from exposure to his
father, Trelawney’s failure to report the beating by the father
can  easily  be  said  to  have  proximately  caused  (i.e.,  been
closely related to) the death of Smith at the hands of the father.
(D) is wrong because the statute imposes a duty on day care

373

workers,  regardless  of  what  their  superiors  may  have
sanctioned. Any duty or criminal behavior attributable to the
supervisor  would  not  prevent  conviction  of  Trelawney  for
violation of his duty.

II.   FELONY-MURDER

A.  Causal relationship

1.  Robberies, burglaries and gunfights

a.  Victim or police officer kills bystander

i.  MBE tip

Question 29: Steve, in desperate need of money, decided to
hold  up  a  local  convenience  store.  Determined  not  to  harm
anyone, he carried a toy gun that resembled a real gun. In the
store, he pointed the toy gun at the clerk and demanded money.
A  customer  who  entered  the  store  and  saw  the  robbery  in
progress  pulled  his  own  gun  and  fired  at  Steve.  The  bullet
missed Steve but struck and killed the clerk.

Steve was charged with felony murder.
His best argument for being found NOT guilty is that he
(A)  did not intend to kill.
(B)    did  not  commit  the  robbery  because  he  never  acquired

any money from the clerk.

(C)  did not intend to create any risk of harm.
(D)  is not responsible for the acts of the customer.
Answer  29:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  felony-murder  rule
provides  that  if  the  defendant,  while  he  is  in  the  process  of
committing  a  felony  (such  as  robbery),  kills  another  (even
accidentally),  the  killing  is  murder.  However,  if  the  killing
that  took  place  during  commission  of  the  felony  was  by  an
innocent party (the customer) and he killed an innocent party
(the clerk), then a court may well hold that the robber would
not  be  responsible  for  the  shooting  (though  this  is  not  at  all
certain).
(A)  is  wrong  because,  in  a  jurisdiction  recognizing  felony
murder, it is not required that the defendant have the intent to

374

kill,  as  long  as  he  had  the  intent  to  commit  a  felony  (in  this
case, robbery).

(B)  is  wrong  because  for  felony-murder  liability,  it  is  not
necessary that the defendant be successful in his commission
of the felony, merely that the murder occurred in the process
of an attempt to commit the felony.

(C)  is  wrong  because  where  the  defendant  had  the  intent  to
commit  one  of  the  specified  dangerous  felonies  that  will
support  felony  murder,  that’s  the  only  intent  the  defendant
needs  to  have.  So  the  fact  that  the  defendant  didn’t  intend  to
“create any risk of harm” is irrelevant.

2.  Arson

Question  30:  Shore  decided  to  destroy  his  dilapidated
building  in  order  to  collect  the  insurance  money.  He  hired
Parsons  to  burn  down  the  building.  Parsons  broke  into  the
building  and  carefully  searched  it  to  make  sure  no  one  was
inside.  He  failed,  however,  to  see  a  vagrant  asleep  in  an
office  closet.  He  started  a  fire.  The  building  was  destroyed
and the vagrant died from burns a week later. Two days after
the fire, Shore filed an insurance claim in which he stated that
he had no information about the cause of the fire.

If Shore is guilty of felony-murder, it is because the vagrant’s
death occurred in connection with the felony of

(A)  arson.
(B)  fraud.
(C)  conspiracy.
(D)  burglary.
Answer  30:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  If  Shore  is  guilty  of
felony-murder, it will be because the vagrant’s death occurred
during  the  commission  of  arson.  The  felony-murder  rule
allows  the  intent  to  commit  a  felony  to  supply  the  mens  rea
required for murder when the felony is the proximate cause of
the  killing.  The  rule  states  that  when  a  defendant  commits  a
felony that is inherently dangerous, and in so doing causes the
death of another, the killing is murder. A felony is considered
inherently  dangerous  if  death  is  a  foreseeable  result  of  the
crime.  Here,  the  underlying  felony  was  arson,  which  is  an

375

inherently dangerous crime because it inherently carries with
it the risk to human life. Shore is responsible for the results of
the fire because, although he did not personally start the fire
that resulted in the vagrant’s death, he is guilty of arson as an
accomplice  since  he  hired  Parsons  to  burn  the  building.
Additionally,  for  the  felony-murder  rule  to  apply,  the  felony
must  be  independent  of  the  killing.  This  requirement  is  met
here because the purpose of starting the fire was not to harm
the vagrant, but only to destroy the building.

Choices  (B)  and  (C)  are  wrong  because  neither  fraud  nor
conspiracy  is  an  inherently  dangerous  felony,  and  therefore
the  underlying  felony  for  a  felony-murder
cannot  be 
conviction.

(D)  is  wrong  because  Shore  has  not  committed  burglary.
Burglary  requires  the  unlawful  breaking  and  entering  of  a
building  of  another  with  the  intent  to  commit  a  crime  once
inside. Although Parsons “broke” into the building, he did so
with  the  consent  of  the  building’s  owner.  As  a  result,
Parsons’s  presence  in  the  building  was  lawful,  despite  his
means of entry and intent to commit arson.

B.  Accomplice liability of co-felons

1.  “In furtherance” test

Question  31:  Dawson  was  charged  with  felony  murder
because of his involvement in a bank robbery. The evidence
at trial disclosed that Smith invited Dawson to go for a ride in
his  new  car,  and  after  a  while  asked  Dawson  to  drive.  As
Smith  and  Dawson  drove  around  town,  Smith  explained  to
Dawson  that  he  planned  to  rob  the  bank  and  that  he  needed
Dawson to drive the getaway car. Dawson agreed to drive to
the bank and to wait outside while Smith went in to rob it. As
they  approached  the  bank,  Dawson  began  to  regret  his
agreement to help with the robbery. Once there, Smith got out
of the car. As Smith went out of sight inside the bank, Dawson
drove  away  and  went  home.  Inside  the  bank,  Smith  killed  a
bank  guard  who  tried  to  prevent  him  from  leaving  with  the
money. Smith ran outside and, finding that his car and Dawson
were  gone,  ran  down  an  alley.  He  was  apprehended  a  few
blocks away. Dawson later turned himself in after hearing on

376

the radio that Smith had killed the guard.

The  jurisdiction  has  a  death  penalty  that  applies  to  felony
murder.

Consistent  with  the  law  and  the  Constitution,  the  jury  may
convict Dawson of

(A)  felony murder and impose the death penalty.
(B)  felony murder but not impose the death penalty.
(C)  bank robbery only.
(D)  no crime.
Answer  31:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  felony-murder  rule
provides  that  if  the  defendant,  while  he  is  in  the  process  of
committing  a  dangerous  felony  (such  as  robbery),  kills
another (even accidentally), the killing is murder. Dawson, by
driving Smith to the bank, serving as lookout, and agreeing to
drive  the  getaway  car,  was  an  accomplice  to  bank  robbery.
Once  Dawson  performed  those  “accomplice”  services,  in  a
way  that  contributed  to  Smith’s  carrying  out  the  robbery,
Dawson  became  substantively  liable  for  robbery  too.  After
that,  any  killing  by  Smith  that  could  be  said  to  be  a  “natural
and  probable”  result  of  the  felony  will  be  attributable  to
Dawson under the felony murder doctrine.

With respect to the death penalty, the Supreme Court has held
that  the  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  the  use  of  the  death
penalty on a defendant “who does not kill himself, attempt to
kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force may
be  employed.”  Enmund  v.  Florida  (1982).  Therefore,  the
death penalty may not be imposed upon Dawson, who did not
himself kill, attempt to kill or intend that a killing take place
or that lethal force be used.
(A)  is  wrong  because  the  death  penalty  may  not  be  imposed
under these circumstances, as discussed in the explanation of
(B).
(C)  is  wrong  because  Dawson  may  be  convicted  of  felony-
murder due to the fact that he is responsible for his co-felon’s
killing of the bank guard that was committed in furtherance of
the felony, as discussed in the explanation of (B).
(D)  is  wrong  because  (1)  Dawson  is  guilty  of  bank  robbery

377

on  an  accomplice  theory;  and  (2)  he  may  be  convicted  of
felony-murder, as discussed in the explanation of (B).

III.  MANSLAUGHTER

A.  Voluntary manslaughter

Question 32: A state statute defines murder in the first degree
as  “knowingly  causing  the  death  of  another  person  after
deliberation  upon  the  matter.”  Second-degree  murder  is
defined  as  “knowingly  causing  the  death  of  another  person.”
Manslaughter  is  defined  as  at  common  law.  Deliberation  is
defined  as  “cool  reflection  for  any  length  of  time,  no  matter
how brief.” The defendant, despondent and angry over losing
his  job,  was  contemplating  suicide.  He  took  his  revolver,
went  to  a  bar,  and  drank  until  he  was  very  intoxicated.  A
customer  on  the  next  stool  was  telling  the  bartender  how  it
was necessary for companies to downsize and become more
efficient in order to keep the economy strong. The defendant
turned to him and said, “Why don’t you shut the hell up.” The
customer  responded,  “This  is  a  free  country  and  I  can  say
what I want,” all the while shaking his finger at the defendant.
The  finger-shaking,  combined  with  the  defendant’s  already
bad  disposition  and  the  alcohol,  enraged  the  defendant.
Trembling with fury, he snatched his revolver from his pocket
and shot and killed the customer.

What crime did the defendant commit?

(A) 

  Manslaughter,  because 
explanation for his becoming enraged.

there  was  a  reasonable

(B)  Murder in the first degree, because deliberation can take

place in an instant.

(C)    Murder  in  the  first  degree,  because  he  contemplated

taking a human life before becoming intoxicated.

(D)    Murder  in  the  second  degree,  because  he  knowingly
caused the customer’s death without deliberation.
Answer 32: Choice (D) is correct, because the defendant did
“knowingly  cause  the  death  of  another  person,”  and  his
intoxication  did  not  preclude  the  mental  state  required  for
second-degree  murder.  Voluntary,  self-induced  intoxication

378

may negate the required mental state in specific intent crimes.
It is generally held, however, that intoxication cannot further
reduce  the  homicide  from  second-degree  murder  down  to
manslaughter. See LaFave, Criminal Law § 9.5(b).

(A)  is  wrong,  because  there  was  no  reasonable  explanation
the  defendant  becoming  enraged.  To  qualify  as
for 
manslaughter,  the  defendant’s  act  must  be  in  response  to  a
provocation  sufficiently  strong  that  a  reasonable  person
would  have  been  caused  to  lose  self-control  enough  to  kill.
The victim’s comments and action of shaking his finger at the
defendant are not enough to cause a reasonable person to lose
self-control  to  such  an  extent  that  he  kills.  Furthermore,  the
defendant’s  intoxication  did  not  preclude  the  mental  state
required  for  second-degree  murder.  Voluntary  self-induced
intoxication  may  negate  the  required  mental  state  in  specific
intent  crimes.  It  is  generally  held,  however,  that  intoxication
cannot  further  reduce  the  homicide  from  second-degree
murder  down  to  manslaughter.  See  LaFave,  Criminal  Law  §
9.5(b).

(B)  is  wrong  because,  even  if  this  statement  were  true,  the
defendant’s  intoxicated  anger  prevented  the  kind  of  “cool
reflection”  required  for  deliberation.  See,  e.g.,  LaFave,
Substantive  Criminal  Law  §  14.7(a):  A  “killer  may,  in  a
particular situation, be incapable of that cool reflection called
for  by  the  requirement  of  premeditation  and  deliberation,  as
where his capacity to premeditate and deliberate is prevented
by  emotional  upset,  [or]  by  intoxication  .  .  .  .”  Here,  the
defendant  was  “[t]rembling  with  fury”  due  to  his  “bad
disposition and alcohol,” which provides strong evidence that
he was not capable of cool reflection.
(C) is wrong, because the defendant did not deliberate upon
taking the life “of another person” (as required by the statute)
prior to becoming intoxicated. Instead, he was contemplating
suicide, which would not qualify as murder in the first degree
under the statute.

B.  Involuntary manslaughter

the  following  statute:
Question  33:  A  state  adopted 
“VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER. Whoever in the course of

379

driving  a  motor  vehicle  as  defined  in  the  Vehicle  Code  is
criminally  negligent  in  driving  such  vehicle  or  omits  to  do
anything  that  is  his  duty  to  do  and  shows  a  wanton  and
reckless  disregard  for  the  safety  of  other  persons  and  as  a
result  of  such  act  or  omission  causes  the  death  of  a  human
being is guilty of vehicular manslaughter.”

Vehicular  manslaughter  is  punishable  by  a  sentence  of  not
more  than  ten  years  in  the  state  prison  or  not  more  than  one
year  in  the  county  jail.  A  defendant,  driving  along  at  a
reasonable rate of speed, was distracted by a child carrying a
silver  balloon.  He  went  through  a  boulevard  stop  light  and
is  charged  with  vehicular
killed  a  pedestrian.  He 
manslaughter.  Of  the  following  proposed  definitions  of
criminal  negligence,  which 
the
defendant?

is  most  favorable 

to 

(A)    Criminal  negligence  is  something  more  than  the  slight
negligence  necessary  to  support  a  civil  action  for
damages. It means disregard for the consequences of the
act and indifference to rights of others.

(B)  Any person who drives a motor vehicle should realize the
danger  to  others.  If  he  fails  to  respond  to  surrounding
circumstances,  he  is  criminally  negligent.  Criminal
negligence  involves  reckless  disregard  for  the  lives  or
safety of others.

(C)    To  find  the  defendant  guilty  of  criminal  negligence,  the
jury  must  find  as  a  fact  that  he  intentionally  did
something he should not have done or intentionally failed
to  do  something  which  he  should  have  done  under
circumstances that demonstrate a conscious disregard of
a  known  danger  that  his  conduct  would  produce  the
result which it did produce.

(D)    Criminal  negligence  is  something  more  than  the  slight
negligence  usually  required  for  tort  liability.  It  is
something less than the wanton misconduct required for
civil  liability  under  the  guest  statute.  It  is,  of  course,
conduct  that  demonstrates  something  less  than  the
abandoned and malignant heart required for murder.
Answer 33: Choice (C) is correct, because it introduces the
strongest  subjective  element  into  the  definition  of  criminal

380

negligence.

the  defendant,  not 

The key here is that the question is asking the most favorable
the  most  reasonable
definition  for 
definition.  The  way  to  determine  this  is  to  identify  the
response that creates the most difficult standard to meet, since
that’s  the  definition  under  which  the  defendant  will  most
likely  be  exonerated.  To  do  that,  you  should  identify  the
standard  that  has  the  strongest  subjective  element — and
that’s Choice C.

This  choice  states  that  criminal  negligence  requires  the
defendant (1) to intentionally do something he shouldn’t have
done  or  (2)  to  intentionally  fail  to  do  something  he  should
have done, each of which requires a conscious disregard of a
known  danger.  Therefore,  Choice  (C)  makes  it  unlikely  that
the  defendant  will  be  convicted — while  his  behavior  was
probably negligent from an objective viewpoint, he probably
did not consciously disregard a known danger.

(A)  is  wrong,  because  it  does  not  offer  a  definition  that’s
particularly  helpful  to  the  defendant.  By  merely  stating  that
criminal negligence is something more than slight negligence,
the defendant here is left open to liability, because he clearly
disregarded the consequences of his act (whether consciously
or not) — not watching where he was going — and displayed
indifference  to  the  rights  of  others.  That’s  a  definition  less
favorable  to  him  than  (C),  which  in  effect  requires  a
conscious disregard of consequences and the rights of others.

(B) is wrong, because it is not favorable to the defendant. The
failure  to  respond  to  surrounding  circumstances  would  cook
the defendant’s goose, because that’s what he did — he failed
to  respond  to  the  stop  light.  Furthermore,  the  concept  of
reckless  disregard  might  be  interpreted  to  contain  only  an
objective  element, 
individual  undertook  an
the 
unjustifiable risk, whether he was conscious of the risk or not.
That  interpretation  would  make  it  easier  to  convict  the
defendant than the Choice (C) standard, which incorporates a
requirement of conscious disregard of risk.
(D)  is  wrong,  because  it  offers  a  definition  under  which  the
defendant would likely be found guilty. A definition favorable

that 

381

to  the  defendant  would  provide  as  strict  a  definition  as
possible  of  criminal  negligence.  By  characterizing  criminal
negligence  as  something  more  than  slight  negligence  in  tort,
but less than wanton misconduct, Choice (D) virtually invites
a  guilty  verdict,  since  the  defendant’s  conduct  in  ignoring  a
stop light and killing a pedestrian on a crosswalk could easily
be  characterized  as  gross  negligence.  The  best  thing  for  the
defendant  is  to  offer  a  definition  that  includes  as  strong  a
subjective element as possible (e.g., a definition that requires
at  least  conscious  disregard  of  the  risk),  which  Choice  (C)
does far better than (D).

IV.  RAPE

A.  Rape defined

1.  Without consent

a.  Mistake no defense

Question 34: A statute provides: A person commits the crime
of  rape  if  he  has  sexual  intercourse  with  a  female,  not  his
wife, without her consent.
Dunbar  is  charged  with  the  rape  of  Sally.  At  trial,  Sally
testifies  to  facts  sufficient  for  a  jury  to  find  that  Dunbar  had
sexual intercourse with her, that she did not consent, and that
the two were not married. Dunbar testifies in his own defense
that he believed that Sally had consented to sexual intercourse
and that she was his common-law wife.

At the conclusion of the case, the court instructed the jury that
in order to find Dunbar guilty of rape, it must find beyond a
reasonable  doubt  that  he  had  sexual  intercourse  with  Sally
without her consent.
The  court  also  instructed  the  jury  that  it  should  find  the
defendant not guilty if it found either that Sally was Dunbar’s
wife  or  that  Dunbar  reasonably  believed  that  Sally  had
consented  to  the  sexual  intercourse,  but  that  the  burden  of
persuasion as to these issues was on the defendant.
jury  found  Dunbar  guilty,  and  Dunbar  appealed,
The 
contending  that  the  court’s  instructions  on  the  issues  of
whether  Sally  was  his  wife  and  whether  he  reasonably

382

believed she had consented violated his constitutional rights.

Dunbar’s constitutional rights were

(A)  violated by the instructions as to both issues.
(B)    violated  by  the  instruction  as  to  whether  Sally  was  his
wife,  but  not  violated  by  the  instruction  on  belief  as  to
consent.

(C)  violated by the instruction on belief as to consent, but not
violated  by  the  instruction  as  to  whether  Sally  was  his
wife.

(D)  not violated by either part of the instructions.
Answer 34: Choice (B) is correct. As a criminal defendant,
the  Due  Process  Clause  guarantees  that  Dunbar  carries  no
burden  to  prove  or  disprove  any  element  of  the  crime  of
which  he  is  charged.  The  prosecution  carries  the  burden  of
persuasion as to every element of the crime. Dunbar only has
a burden of persuasion as to any affirmative defense he may
raise.  Dunbar  has  been  charged  with  rape,  which  in  this
jurisdiction  (as  at  common  law)  is  defined  as  a  defendant’s
(1) having sexual intercourse with a female, (2) not his wife,
(3) without her consent. This means that the prosecutor must
prove  each  one  of  those  elements  and  that  Dunbar  has  no
burden of persuasion as to any of them. The judge is required
to give an instruction that does not unduly saddle Dunbar with
any burden regarding any element of the crime. Let’s examine
each of the judge’s instructions separately.

The  judge’s  instruction  that  the  jury  should  find  Dunbar  not
guilty  if  it  found  that  Sally  was  Dunbar’s  wife,  and  that
Dunbar  carried  the  burden  of  persuasion  on  this  issue,
violated Dunbar’s constitutional rights. The issue of whether
Sally  was  Dunbar’s  wife  is  an  element  of  the  crime,  so
Dunbar could never be required to bear the burden to prove
or disprove it — it must be solely the prosecution’s burden to
prove  that  Sally  was  not  Dunbar’s  wife.  Therefore,  the
the  burden  of
judge’s 
persuasion  on  this  issue  from  the  prosecution  to  Dunbar,  in
violation of his due process rights.
On the other hand, the judge’s instruction that the jury should
find  Dunbar  not  guilty  if  it  found  that  Dunbar  reasonably

improperly  shifted 

instruction 

383

believed  Sally  had  consented  to  the  sexual  intercourse,  and
that  the  burden  was  on  Dunbar  to  persuade  the  jury  of  that
fact, did not violate Dunbar’s constitutional rights. Dunbar’s
belief as to consent at the time is not an element of rape, so
the  prosecution  does  not  have  to  prove  that  Dunbar  knew
Sally  did  not  consent  in  order  to  convict  him.  (If  this
jurisdiction follows the majority rule, Dunbar’s mistake about
consent,  even  if  reasonable,  would  be  no  defense  to  the
charge of rape. In that case, the judge’s instruction would be
in error, but in a way that would be likely to cause a jury to
acquit  Dunbar,  not  convict  him.  Even  if  the  defendant’s
reasonable  belief  as  to  consent  was  recognized  by  the
jurisdiction  as  an  affirmative  defense,  the  defendant  could
constitutionally  be  required  to  bear  the  burden  of  producing
evidence to support that defense, and the burden of persuasion
by a preponderance of the evidence as to it.)

(A) is wrong because it incorrectly states that Dunbar’s rights
were violated by the instruction on reasonable belief.

(C),  like  (A),  is  wrong  because  it  incorrectly  states  that
instruction  on
Dunbar’s  rights  were  violated  by 
reasonable belief.
(D) is wrong by not stating that Dunbar’s rights were violated
by the instruction on whether Sally was his wife.

V.   KIDNAPPING

A.  Definition of kidnapping

1.  Asportation

a.  M.P.C. “substantial distance” rule

Question  35:  A  driver  stopped  at  a  red  light  in  his  home
state.  A  stranger  opened  the  passenger  door,  got  in,  and
pointed  a  gun  at  the  driver.  The  stranger  then  directed  the
driver to keep driving. They drove several miles, crossed into
a neighboring state, and drove several more miles. When they
reached a remote location, the stranger ordered the driver to
pull  over.  The  stranger  then  robbed  the  driver  of  his  wallet
and cash, and ordered him out of the car. The stranger drove
off in the driver’s car.
The  stranger  is  charged  with  kidnapping  in  the  neighboring

384

state, which has adopted the Model Penal Code.

Could the stranger properly be convicted of kidnapping in the
neighboring state?

(A)   Yes, because the driver was transported under threat of

force in the neighboring state.

(B)      Yes,  because  the  driver  in  effect  paid  ransom  for  his

release.

(C)      No,  because  any  kidnapping  took  place  in  the  driver’s

home state.

(D)   No, because the restraint was incidental to the robbery.
Answer  35:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  First,  notice  that  the
question  was  carefully  set  up  to  involve  two  states:  the
victim’s home state, and the neighboring state. The reason the
examiners set it up this way is that they wanted to be able to
ask  you  whether  that  part  of  the  episode  that  involved
transporting  the  victim  into  and  within  the  neighboring  state
was  part  of  the  crime — for  instance,  if  the  crime  of
kidnapping was defined in such a way that the crime here was
over as soon as the stranger got in the car and drove the first
few miles with the victim, then there would be no kidnapping
in the neighboring state, only in the home state. But the M.P.C.
does not define kidnapping in such a narrow way. The M.P.C.
(like  nearly  all  states)  defines  kidnapping  to  require  either
transporting  of  the  victim  (usually  called  “asportation”)  or
secret  imprisonment  of  the  victim.  The  M.P.C.  then  says  that
asportation occurs only if the defendant either (1) “removes”
the  victim  from  his  “place  of  residence  or  business,”  or  (2)
moves  the  victim  “a  substantial  distance  from  the  vicinity
where  he  is  found.”  M.P.C.  §  212.1.  The  Commentary  says
that  the  “substantial  distance”  requirement  is  designed  to
“preclude kidnapping convictions based on trivial changes of
location having no bearing on the evil at hand” (e.g., a rapist
who forces his victim a few steps into a parked car does not
commit kidnapping).
Here,  the  stranger’s  act  of  forcing  the  driver  to  transport
himself “several miles” to the state border, then several more
miles,  clearly  meets  the  “substantial  distance”  requirement.
And since the description of the crime makes it clear that the

385

stranger wanted to abandon the driver in a secluded location,
the transporting was not a “trivial change [] of location having
no bearing on the evil at hand.” So the part of the episode that
occurred  in  the  neighboring  state  was  definitely  part  of  the
crime,  under  the  definition  of  kidnapping  in  the  M.P.C.  (and
indeed, under the definitions of virtually every state).

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  reaches  the  correct  conclusion  by
incorrect  reasoning.  First,  it  is  hard  to  characterize  the
proceeds  of  the  robbery  as  “ransom.”  But  more  importantly,
the  propriety  of  a  kidnapping  conviction  does  not  turn  on
whether ransom was paid. The M.P.C. defines kidnapping to
mean  either  the  moving  of  a  person  “a  substantial  distance,”
or the “unlawful confine[ment]” of a person “for a substantial
period  in  a  place  of  isolation,”  so  long  as  the  moving  or
confinement is done with any of a variety of purposes (e.g.,
holding  for  ransom,  holding  as  a  hostage,  facilitating
commission  of  any  felony  or  flight  thereafter,  inflicting  any
bodily injury, etc.). M.P.C. § 212.1. Here, the stranger carried
out the “moving” (“asportation,” as it’s usually called) for the
purpose of later committing robbery, a felony. So whether the
driver  did  or  did  not  pay  ransom  is  irrelevant.  (Indeed,
kidnapping  is  like  burglary,  in  the  sense  that  as  long  as  the
defendant  confines  or  transports  with  one  of  the  forbidden
purposes, the crime is complete as soon as the confinement or
moving-a-substantial-distance  occurs,  even  if  the  purpose  is
never  fulfilled.  So  here,  once  the  stranger  transported  the
driver into the neighboring state, the crime was complete even
if  the  stranger  had  then  abandoned  his  plan  of  robbing  the
driver of his car and wallet.)

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  stranger  properly  could  be
convicted  of  kidnapping  in  both  states.  The  movement  in  the
neighboring state was more than incidental to the robbery, and
would  constitute  kidnapping  there  as  well  as  in  the  driver’s
home state. That’s especially true since the underlying felony
of  robbery — the  “purpose”  for  which  the  transportation
occurred — happened  in  the  neighboring  state.  For  more
about  why  the  crime  is  deemed  to  have  occurred  in  both
states, see the analysis of Choice (A).
(D)  is  wrong  because  the  restraint  was  not  incidental  to  the

386

robbery. It’s true that the M.P.C. defines kidnapping in such a
way that where a restraint and/or a transporting is for a brief
time  or  distance,  and  is  truly  incidental  to  the  “main”  crime
intended  by  the  defendant,  kidnapping  will  not  be  deemd  to
have occurred. So, for instance, a rapist who forces his victim
into a parked car or dark alley does not commit kidnapping.
M.P.C. § 212.1, Commentary. But here, the stranger caused the
driver to be transported several miles to the state border, then
another several miles, all for the purpose of getting him to a
secluded location where the car could be stolen. Under these
facts, the restraint (and the transporting) were not  incidental
to the robbery.

2.  Confinement must be against V’s will

Question 36: John asked Doris to spend a weekend with him
at his apartment and promised her they would get married on
the following Monday. Doris agreed and also promised John
that  she  would  not  tell  anyone  of  their  plans.  Unknown  to
Doris,  John  had  no  intention  of  marrying  her.  After  Doris
came  to  his  apartment,  John  told  Doris  he  was  going  for
cigarettes.  He  called  Doris’s  father  and  told  him  that  he  had
his  daughter  and  would  kill  her  if  he  did  not  receive
$100,000.  John  was  arrested  on  Sunday  afternoon  when  he
went to pick up the $100,000. Doris was still at the apartment
and knew nothing of John’s attempt to get the money.

John is guilty of

(A)  kidnapping.
(B)  attempted kidnapping.
(C)  kidnapping or attempted kidnapping but not both.
(D)  neither kidnapping nor attempted kidnapping.
Answer 36:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  John  is  guilty  of  neither
kidnapping  nor  attempted  kidnapping.  Let’s  examine  each
crime separately.
John has not committed kidnapping because Doris was free to
leave  his  apartment  at  any  time.  Kidnapping  is  the  (1)
unlawful confinement of another person, (2) accompanied by
either the moving or secreting away of that person. Although
John may have tricked Doris into spending the weekend at his
apartment,  he  did  nothing  to  confine  her  once  she  got  there.

387

Confinement occurs when the victim is either forced to remain
where she does not wish to remain or compelled to go where
she  does  not  wish  to  be.  Doris  desired  to  be  at  John’s
apartment and could have left had she so chosen, so she was
not confined. The lack of confinement negates the first element
of kidnapping, so John has not committed the crime. (And the
fact that Doris’ presence was brought about by John’s trickery
about  his  intent  to  marry  her  won’t  matter — he  hasn’t
confined her, and that’s all that matters.)

John is not guilty of attempted kidnapping because he did not
intend  for  his  actions  to  confine  Doris  to  his  apartment.  In
order  to  find  John  guilty  of  attempt,  the  prosecution  would
have to show that John intended to commit each element of the
crime.  In  this  case,  John  didn’t  intent  to  confine,  so  he  can’t
have attempt to kidnap.

Choices  (A),  (B),  and  (C)  are  all  wrong  because  they  each
state  that  John  is  guilty  of  either  kidnapping  or  attempted
kidnapping,  which  cannot  be  true  if  there  has  been  no
confinement and no attempt to confine.

CHAPTER 8
THEFT CRIMES

I.    LARCENY

A.  Trespassory taking

1.  Larceny by trick

a.  Intent to steal required

Question 37: Smith asked Jones if he would loan him $500,
promising  to  repay  the  amount  within  two  weeks.  Jones
loaned  him  the  $500.  The  next  day  Smith  took  the  money  to
the race track and lost all of it betting on horse races. He then
left town for six months. He has not repaid Jones.

Smith has committed

(A)    both  larceny  by  trick  and  obtaining  money  by  false
pretenses  (although  he  can  only  be  convicted  of  one
offense).

(B)  larceny by trick only.
(C)  obtaining money by false pretenses only.
(D)    neither  larceny  by  trick  nor  obtaining  money  by  false

pretenses.

Answer 37: Choice (D) is correct. Let’s take the crimes one
at a time. First, larceny by trick is a form of larceny, in which
the  initial  possession  by  the  defendant  is  not  only  wrongful
(which is required for any form of larceny), but is caused by
fraud or deceit (as opposed to, say, by force). The fact pattern
does  not  indicate  that  Smith  had  any  intention  other  than  the
intent to repay the loan, when he asked to borrow money from
Jones. Therefore, he did not intend to “steal” at the moment he
received the money, which would be required for larceny by
trick.
Next,  obtaining  money  by  false  pretenses  occurs  when  the
defendant  makes  a  false  representation  of  a  material  present
or  past  fact,  which  causes  the  person  to  whom  it  is  made  to
pass title to his property to the defendant, who knows that his
representation  is  false,  and  intends  to  defraud.  So  for  this

389

offense,  the  defendant  must  be  proved  to  have  knowingly
made a false representation that causes the victim to pass title
to  his  property.  There  is  no  indication  that  when  Smith
promised  to  repay  the  $500  within  two  weeks,  Smith  was
intentionally making a false representation about his intent — 
for all we know, he indeed believed that he would be willing
and able to repay the loan on schedule. Therefore, Smith did
not have the mental state required at the time title to the money
was  passed  (if,  indeed,  title  rather  than  mere  possession  is
deemed to have passed at the moment of the loan), and can’t
be guilty of false pretenses no matter what his post-loan state
of mind may have been.

(A),  (B),  and  (C)  are  all  wrong,  because  each  would  make
Smith  guilty  of  at  least  one  crime  (either  larceny  by  trick  or
false pretenses, or both) and he cannot be convicted of either
for the reasons discussed in Choice (D).

B.  Personal property

1.  No minimum value

Question  38:  David  entered  the  county  museum  at  a  time
when  it  was  open  to  the  public,  intending  to  steal  a  Picasso
etching. Once inside, he took what he thought was the etching
from  an  unlocked  display  case  and  concealed  it  under  his
coat.  However,  the  etching  was  a  photocopy  of  an  original
that  had  been  loaned  to  another  museum.  A  sign  over  the
display  case  containing  the  photocopy  said  that  similar
photocopies  were  available  free  at  the  entrance.  David  did
not see the sign.

Burglary in the jurisdiction is defined as “entering a building
unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime.”
David may be convicted of:

(A)  burglary and larceny.
(B)  burglary and attempted larceny.
(C)  larceny.
(D)  larceny and attempted larceny.
Answer  38:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  For  this  choice  to  be
correct,  David  must  have  committed  larceny.  Larceny  is  the
(1)  trespassory  (2)  taking  and  (3)  carrying  away  (4)  of  the

390

personal  property  (5)  of  another  with  (6)  the  intent  to  steal.
David’s  actions  fulfill  all  of  the  elements:  (1)  he  had  no
permission  to  take  the  document,  (2)  he  took  it,  (3)  and
removed  it  from  its  case,  (4)  and  (5)  the  document  was
property that didn’t belong to him, and (6) he intended to steal
it.  David’s  mistaken  belief  that  the  photocopy  was  in  fact  a
valuable Picasso original is irrelevant. The value of the item
he stole would be relevant to the degree of larceny of which
David is guilty, but the common law definition of larceny has
no  minimum  value  threshold.  Also  irrelevant  is  the  fact  that
David  could  have  lawfully  obtained  a  duplicate  for  free — 
it’s true that he could legally have taken one of the copies at
the entrance, but he had no permission to take the copy in the
display case.

(A)  is  wrong  because  David  is  not  guilty  of  burglary.  As
defined  in  the  given  statute,  burglary  requires  two  elements:
(1)  entering  a  building  unlawfully,  (2)  with  the  intent  to
commit  a  crime.  It  is  indisputable  that  David  intended  to
commit a crime once inside the museum since we are told that
he  entered  “intending  to  steal  a  Picasso  etching.”  However,
David’s entry wasn’t unlawful. When he entered the museum,
it  was  open  to  all  members  of  the  public,  including  David.
The fact that a criminal purpose motivated his entry does not
make  that  entry  “unlawful.”  For  the  purposes  of  burglary,
entry is only unlawful if the defendant entered a building, or
remained in a building, in which he had no permission to be.
Since  David’s  entry  to  the  museum  was  lawful,  he  has  not
committed burglary.

(B) is wrong for the same reason that (A) is wrong: David is
not guilty of burglary.
(D)  is  wrong  because  although  David  could  be  convicted
solely  of  attempted  larceny,  under  the  majority  approach  he
cannot be convicted of both larceny and attempted larceny. On
these  facts,  attempted  larceny  is  a  lesser  included  offense
within larceny (only one act of “taking” is charged), so if the
court  convicts  him  of  larceny,  it  cannot  separately  also
convict him of attempted larceny.

C.  Intent to steal

391

1.  Claim of right

a.  Grievance not enough

Question  39:  The  defendant  worked  as  the  cashier  in  a
restaurant.  One  night  after  the  restaurant  had  closed,  the
defendant  discovered  that  the  amount  of  cash  in  the  cash
register did not match the cash register receipt tapes. He took
the  cash  and  the  tapes,  put  them  in  a  bag,  gave  them  to  the
manager of the restaurant, and reported the discrepancy. The
manager  immediately  accused  him  of  taking  money  from  the
register  and  threatened  to  fire  him  if  he  did  not  make  up  the
difference.  The  manager  placed  the  bag  in  the  office  safe.
Angered by what he considered to be an unjust accusation, the
defendant  waited  until  the  manager  left  the  room  and  then
reached  into  the  still  open  safe,  took  the  bag  containing  the
cash, and left.
The defendant is guilty of
(A)  larceny.
(B)  embezzlement.
(C)  either larceny or embezzlement but not both.
(D)  neither larceny nor embezzlement.
Answer  39:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Larceny  is  the  (1)
trespassory (2) taking and (3) carrying away of (4) personal
property (5) of another (6) with intent to steal. The defendant
took  the  restaurant’s  money  from  the  safe  with  the  intent  to
steal it, so he is guilty of larceny. The fact that the defendant
felt  (properly  or  not)  aggrieved  by  the  false  accusation  is
irrelevant.  If  the  defendant  had  had  a  genuine  belief  that  he
had a “claim of right” to money or property in the defendant’s
possession,  and  had  taken  the  money  in  satisfaction  of  that
claim,  this  might  be  a  defense  to  larceny;  but  the  defendant
didn’t have that belief here — he was just feeling aggrieved.
(B) is wrong because the defendant took the money from the
office safe. Embezzlement is the (1) fraudulent (2) conversion
of (3) the property (4) of another (5) by one who is already in
lawful  possession  of  it.  The  element  missing  here  is  the  one
requiring  lawful  possession.  The  defendant,  as  cashier,  had
lawful  possession  of  the  money  while  he  was  working  the
cash register and putting it into a bag in order to give it to the

392

manager (so if he had taken it and carried it away with intent
to steal at that point, it would have been embezzlement). But
once the bag was put into the office safe, the defendant did not
have  lawful  possession  of  it  any  more.  Therefore,  when  he
took it from the safe he could not be guilty of embezzlement.

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  defendant  is  not  guilty  of
embezzlement, as discussed in Choice (B). (Also, at common
law,  larceny  and  embezzlement  are  defined  in  mutually
exclusive  ways,  so  it  could  not  be  the  case  that  the
prosecution  had  a  choice  of  which  crime  to  charge  on  any
given state of facts.)

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  defendant  is  guilty  of  larceny,  as
discussed in Choice (A).

II.   BURGLARY

A.  Breaking

Question  40:  Sam  told  Horace,  his  neighbor,  that  he  was
going away for two weeks and asked Horace to keep an eye
on his house. Horace agreed. Sam gave Horace a key to use to
check on the house.

Horace decided to have a party in Sam’s house. He invited a
number  of  friends.  One  friend,  Lewis,  went  into  Sam’s
bedroom,  took  some  of  Sam’s  rings,  and  put  them  in  his
pocket.

Which of the following is true?

(A)  Horace and Lewis are guilty of burglary.
(B)    Horace  is  guilty  of  burglary  and  Lewis  is  guilty  of

larceny.

(C)    Horace  is  guilty  of  trespass  and  Lewis  is  guilty  of

larceny.

(D)  Lewis is guilty of larceny and Horace is not guilty of any

crime.

Answer  40:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  First,  let’s  examine
whether  either  Horace  or  Sam  committed  burglary.  The
answer  is  that  neither  did.  Burglary  is  the  breaking  and
entering  of  the  dwelling  of  another  at  night  with  intent  to

393

commit a felony. Breaking does not occur when one is invited
into a house. Since Horace had a key to the premises and had
permission  to  enter  the  house,  there  was  no  breaking.
Furthermore,  the  facts  do  not  indicate  that  Horace  had  the
intention  to  commit  a  felony  at  the  time  he  entered  the
premises  (or  at  any  time,  for  that  matter);  therefore,  this
requirement is not met either. As to Lewis, he was let into the
premises  by  one  who  was  authorized  to  be  there  (and
presumably, who was authorized to let in others). Therefore,
Lewis, too, did not “break.” (Nor is there any indication that
Lewis had the intent to commit a felony at the time he entered
the  premises — for  all  we  know  this  intent  might  have  been
formed later, when he noticed the jewelry.) Therefore, Lewis
is not guilty of burglary either.

Lewis is guilty of larceny because he took property belonging
to another (Sam’s rings) and “carried them away” (by putting
them in his pocket); a jury could infer that he did this because
he  meant  to  steal  them.  Horace  hasn’t  taken  any  property
belonging to another or intended to; deciding to have a party
in someone else’s house, when one has the right to be in the
house, is not any particular crime, theft or otherwise.

Now, let’s examine whether Horace is guilty of trespass, the
only crime other than burglary about which any of the choices
asserts  Horace  to  be  guilty.  Horace  is  not  guilty  of  trespass,
because  at  all  times  he  was  permitted  to  be  in  Sam’s  house,
under Sam’s invitation. (If Sam had expressly told him not to
have a party, by having a party Horace might have exceeded
the scope of the invitation, and thus become guilty of trespass.
But under the actual facts, he had no reason to believe that the
invitation did not include the right to have a party, or to invite
others to the house.)
(A) is wrong because neither defendant is guilty of burglary,
as explained in the discussion of Choice (D) above.
(B)  is  wrong  because  Horace  is  not  guilty  of  burglary,  as
explained in the discussion of Choice (D) above.
(C) is wrong, because Horace is not guilty of trespass, since
at  all  times  he  was  permitted  to  be  in  Sam’s  house,  and  did
not exceed the scope of his invitation (as is further explained

394

in the last paragraph of the discussion of Choice (D) above).

B.  Entry

Question  41:  A  woman  decided  to  steal  a  necklace  that
belonged to her neighbor. She knew where the neighbor kept
the necklace because she had been in the neighbor’s house on
many occasions when the neighbor had taken off the necklace
and put it away in a jewelry box in the bathroom. One night,
the  woman  went  to  the  neighbor’s  house.  The  neighbor  was
away  and  the  house  was  dark.  The  woman  opened  the
bathroom  window,  saw  the  jewelry  box  on  the  counter,  and
started  to  climb  inside.  As  her  leg  cleared  the  window  sill,
the neighbor’s cat let out a loud screech. Terrified, the woman
bolted back outside and fled.

The  crimes  below  are  listed  in  descending  order  of
seriousness. What is the most serious crime committed by the
woman?

(A)  Burglary.
(B)  Attempted burglary.
(C)  Attempted larceny.
(D)  No crime.
Answer 41: The correct choice is (A). Common-law burglary
is defined as the breaking and entering of the dwelling house
of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony.
LaFave, Criminal Law, § 8.13, at p. 883. The woman satisfies
this definition because she unlawfully entered the neighbor’s
house at night with intent to commit a felony therein (larceny).
The  “breaking”  element  is  satisfied  because  the  woman
opened a window — there is no requirement that the breaking
occur  by  means  of  force,  or  that  the  premises  have  been
secured, such as by a lock. Id. at 884. The “entering” element
is more questionable on these facts, but the woman’s actions
satisfy  this  element  as  well.  See  LaFave,  Criminal  Law,  §
8.13(b), at p. 886 (to constitute burglary it is “sufficient if any
part of the actor’s person intruded, even momentarily, into the
structure. Thus it has been held that the intrusion of a part of a
hand in opening a window, or the momentary intrusion of part
of  a  foot  in  kicking  out  a  window,  constituted  the  requisite
entry.”).

395

(B) is wrong because the woman’s action proceeded beyond
the  point  of  attempted  burglary  to  the  completed  crime  of
burglary, as discussed in the analysis of Choice (A) above.

(C) is wrong because, while the woman may have been guilty
of  attempted  larceny,  that  crime  arguably  would  merge  into,
and in any event was less serious than, the burglary crime.

(D) is wrong because the woman is guilty of burglary, since
she  unlawfully  entered  the  neighbor’s  house  at  night  with
intent to commit a felony (larceny), as more fully discussed in
the analysis of Choice (A) above.

III.  ARSON

A.  Nature of offense

1.  Act posing great risk of fire

a.  Failure to take action

i.  Failure to put out fire D started

Question 42: Defendant was upset because he was going to
have  to  close  his  liquor  store  due  to  competition  from  a
discount store in a new shopping mall nearby. In desperation,
he  decided  to  set  fire  to  his  store  to  collect  the  insurance.
While  looking  through  the  basement  for  flammable  material,
he lit a match to read the label on a can. The match burned his
finger and, in a reflex action, he dropped the match. It fell into
a barrel and ignited some paper. Defendant made no effort to
put  out  the  fire  but  instead  left  the  building.  The  fire  spread
and the store was destroyed by fire. Defendant was eventually
arrested and indicted for arson.
Defendant is
(A)    guilty,  if  he  could  have  put  out  the  fire  before  it  spread
and  did  not  do  so  because  he  wanted  the  building
destroyed.

(B)  guilty, if he was negligent in starting the fire.
(C)  not guilty, because even if he wanted to burn the building
there was no concurrence between his mens rea and the
act of starting the fire.

(D)  not guilty, because his starting the fire was the result of a

396

reflex action and not a voluntary act.

Answer  42:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Ordinarily,  a  defendant
has  no  affirmative  obligation  to  avoid  harm,  only  an
obligation to refrain from doing harm. But where a defendant
brings about a risky situation, then he does have a duty to use
reasonable  efforts  to  avoid  the  harm.  So  once  Defendant
dropped  the  match  (even  if  only  reflexively),  he  had  an
affirmative obligation to stop the fire. When he didn’t, and his
mental state matched a state that will suffice for arson (intent
to burn), he became guilty of arson.

(B)  is  wrong  because  mere  negligence  doesn’t  suffice  for
arson — it’s a crime that requires either an intent to burn, or
(in  some  states)  recklessness  with  regard  to  the  risk  of
burning.

(C)  is  incorrect,  because  there  was  concurrence.  Even  if
Defendant behaved non-negligently in lighting a match in the
first  instance,  and  involuntarily  in  dropping  it,  once  the  fire
started  he  had  the  obligation  to  make  reasonable  efforts  to
stop  it,  because  he  had  caused  the  peril  in  the  first  place.
Once he simultaneously failed to perform that duty to stop the
peril  and  desired  that  the  bad  result  defining  the  crime
(burning) occur, he met the concurrence requirement.

(D) is wrong because, while Defendant may have started the
fire reflexively, once he failed to put it out while under a duty
to do so, this was a voluntary act.

CHAPTER 1
ARREST; PROBABLE CAUSE; SEARCH
WARRANTS

I.    AREAS AND PEOPLE PROTECTED BY THE

FOURTH AMENDMENT

A.  Guests

1.  Guest staying in hotel room

Question 1: A federal officer had probable cause to believe
a woman had participated in a bank robbery. Two days after
the  robbery,  the  woman  checked  into  a  local  hotel  room.
When  the  woman  left  for  the  evening,  the  hotel  manager
opened  the  hotel  room  door  so  the  officer  could  enter  the
room  and  look  inside.  The  officer  did  not  find  any  of  the
stolen money but did see, lying open on the bed, the woman’s
diary.  The  diary  contained  an  entry  describing  the  woman’s
involvement in robbing the bank.
The woman was charged in federal court with bank robbery.
She moved to suppress the diary.
Should the court suppress the diary?
(A)  Yes, because the officer had no warrant.
(B)    Yes,  because  admitting  the  diary  would  violate  the

woman’s privilege against self- incrimination.

(C)    No,  because  the  hotel  manager  had  actual  authority  to

allow the officer into the hotel room.

398

(D)    No,  because  the  officer  reasonably  relied  on  the  hotel
manager’s apparent authority to allow the officer into the
hotel room.

Answer  1:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  Fourth  Amendment
protects  places  as  to  which  a  person  has  a  reasonable
expectation  of  privacy.  One  of  those  places  is  a  person’s
dwelling, even a temporary dwelling like a hotel room. See,
e.g., Minnesota  v.  Olson  (1990)  (overnight  social  guest  has
reasonable expectation of privacy in the home in which she is
staying);  Stoner  v.  California  (1964)  (hotel  guest  is  to  be
treated like any other tenant, and management may not consent
to a search of the guest room prior to check-out). Before the
police  may  enter  a  place  as  to  which  a  suspect  has  a
reasonable  expectation  of  privacy,  the  police  must  (1)  have
probable cause to suspect a crime; and (2) have a search or
arrest warrant, or benefit from some exception to the warrant
requirement. Here, although requirement (1) (probable cause)
was  satisfied,  the  police  did  not  have  a  search  or  arrest
warrant,  and  there  was  nothing  in  the  facts  to  suggest  any
exception  to  the  warrant  requirement.  For  example,  although
there is an exception to the warrant requirement for “exigent
circumstances,”  no  such  circumstances  were  presented  here,
since the woman was out for the evening and thus did not pose
an  imminent  threat  to  destroy  evidence.  (If  the  police  were
worried  that  she  would  destroy  evidence  as  soon  as  she
returned, they could have posted an officer outside the room
to prevent her re-entry, while they sought a warrant.)

Nor  did  the  permission  from  the  hotel  manager  override  the
woman’s  right  not  to  have  her  premises  searched  without  a
warrant, for the reasons described in the analysis of choices
(C) and (D).
(B) is wrong because, although it reaches the right outcome, it
does  so  on  incorrect  reasoning.  The  privilege  against  self-
incrimination  protects  a  person  against  being  required  by
government  to  make  an  incriminating  communication.  Since
the  woman  made  the  diary  entries  without  being  required  to
do so by government, the later seizure of that diary could not
violate her privilege. (If she had been required by subpoena
to produce, say, “any diary or other communication in which

399

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

you discuss the alleged crime,” then this probably would have
violated her privilege, since it would in effect require her to
communicate the information, “This is a diary that I wrote,” a
communication  that  would  tend  to  incriminate  her.  But  here,
since the police seized the diary without requiring the woman
to produce it or authenticate it, there is no self-incrimination
problem.)

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  hotel  manager  did  not  have  actual
authority  to  allow  the  officer  into  the  hotel  room.  “Actual
authority”  is  a  concept  of  agency  law:  If  the  principal
intentionally confers on the agent the right to do something, the
agent is said to have actual authority to do that thing. So if the
woman  had  indicated  (either  expressly  or  by  implication)  to
the hotel management that it was OK for management to enter
and search her room at any time, the management would have
had  actual  authority  to  conduct  its  own  search,  and  also
authority  to  consent  to  the  police  search.  In  another  context,
suppose that D was an employee of X Corp. and had an office
at  corporate  headquarters;  if  the  understanding  was  that  X
Corp.  had  the  right  as  owner  of  the  office  to  search  its
contents  at  any  time,  then  X  Corp.  would  have  had  actual
authority to permit the police to make such a search, and that
permission  would  have  overridden  D’s 
reasonable
expectation of privacy in the office.
But  here,  hotel  management  had  at  most  actual  authority  to
enter for the limited purposes of cleaning, trash removal, and
the like, not for the purpose of making a search of the guest’s
belongings.  Therefore,  the  manager  did  not  have  actual
authority  to  consent  to  the  police  search.  See  Stoner  v.
California (1964) (hotel guest is to be treated like any other
tenant,  and  management  may  not  consent  to  a  search  of  the
guest room prior to check-out).
(D)  is  wrong,  because  the  hotel  manager  did  not  have
apparent  authority  to  allow  the  officer  into  the  hotel  room.
“Apparent  authority,”  like  “actual  authority,”  is  a  concept
from  agency  law — if  the  principal  puts  the  agent  in  such  a
position  that  the  world  reasonably  infers  that  the  agent  has
actual authority to do Act X, then the agent is deemed to have
apparent  authority  to  do  X  even  though  the  agent  does  not

400

have actual authority to do X.

Here,  the  defendant  hotel  guest  (the  principal)  probably  has,
merely  by  checking  into  the  room  and  not  indicating
otherwise,  conferred  on  hotel  management  (the  agent)
apparent authority to enter for limited purposes like cleaning.
But  the  guest  has  not  conferred  apparent  authority  on
management  to  search  the  room,  or  to  give  consent  to  law
enforcement  to  search  the  room — that’s  because  renting  a
hotel  room  is  not  commonly  understood  to  confer  such
authority  on  hotel  management.  Since  hotel  management  did
not  have  apparent  authority  to  consent  to  the  search,  the
police’s reliance on what they thought was apparent authority
was not reasonable, and therefore not effective. Consequently,
the defendant’s basic reasonable expectation of privacy in her
temporary hotel dwelling prevailed, and was enough to make
the  warrantless  entry  a  Fourth  Amendment  violation,  as
further described in Choice (A).

II.   THE “PLAIN VIEW” DOCTRINE

A.  Aerial observation

Question 2:  Police  received  an  anonymous  tip  that  Tusitala
in  her  backyard,  which  was
was  growing  marijuana 
surrounded  by  a  15-foot  high,  solid  wooden  fence.  Officer
Boa was unable to view the yard from the street, so he used a
police helicopter to fly over Tusitala’s house. Boa identified
a  large  patch  of  marijuana  plants  growing  right  next  to  the
house and used this observation to obtain a search warrant.

Tusitala is prosecuted for possession of marijuana and moves
to suppress use of the marijuana in evidence.
The court should
(A)  grant the motion, because the only purpose of Boa’s flight

was to observe the yard.

(B)    grant  the  motion,  because  Tusitala  had  a  reasonable
expectation of privacy in the curtilage around her house
and the police did not have a warrant.

(C)  deny the motion, because a warrant is not required for a

search of a residential yard.

401

(D)    deny  the  motion,  because  Tusitala  had  no  reasonable

expectation of privacy from aerial observation.

Answer 2: Choice (D)  is  correct.  Where  objects  on  private
property  can  be  seen  from  public  places,  observation  by  the
police  does  not  constitute  a  Fourth  Amendment  search.  The
fact  that  a  police  officer  who  obtains  the  “plain  view”  does
so  from  a  contorted  or  otherwise  unusual  position  does  not
prevent  the  “plain  view”  doctrine  from  applying,  assuming
that the policeman is in a place where he has a prior right to
be. Harris v. U.S. (1968). If the police use an aircraft to view
the  defendant’s  property  from  the  air  and  the  aircraft  is  in
public, navigable, airspace, anything the police can see with
the naked eye from that airspace falls within the “plain view”
doctrine.  Even  a  view  taken  by  the  police  from  a  helicopter
flying  only  400  feet  above  the  ground  still  fell  within  the
“plain view” doctrine according to a five-Justice majority in
Florida  v.  Riley  (1989).  Therefore,  the  search  of  Tusitala’s
yard  from  an  aerial  view  was  valid,  and  the  subsequent
issuance of a warrant to seize the marijuana observed in the
search was valid.
(A) is wrong because the purpose of the flight was irrelevant,
as  long  as  the  police  officer  was  in  a  place  where  he  had  a
prior right to be. There is nothing to indicate that the officer
was  not  allowed  to  be  in  the  airspace  above  Tusitala’s
property.

(B)  is  wrong  because,  although  Tusitala  had  a  reasonable
expectation  of  privacy 
in  his  yard  from  ground-level
observation  due  to  his  erection  of  a  15-foot  high  fence,  this
expectation of privacy did not extend to aerial observation, as
explained in the discussion of (D).
(C) is wrong because if a person has a reasonable expectation
of  privacy  in  his  yard,  then  a  warrant  would  be  required  to
enter  it.  In  this  case,  ground-level  observation  of  Tusitala’s
yard,  which  was  enclosed  by  a  15-foot  high  fence,  would
require a warrant; by contrast, aerial observation of the yard
would not require a warrant.

III.  PROBABLE CAUSE GENERALLY

402

A.  Only evidence heard by magistrate used

1.  Perjured affidavit

a.  Honest police error

Question  3:  On  October  22,  a  police  officer  submitted  an
application  for  a  warrant  to  search  217  Elm  Street  for
cocaine.  In  the  application,  the  officer  stated  under  oath  that
he  believed  there  was  cocaine  at  that  location  because  of
information supplied to him on the morning of October 22 by
Susie  Schultz.  He  described  Schultz  as  a  cocaine  user  who
had  previously  supplied  accurate  information  concerning  the
use of cocaine in the community and summarized what Schultz
had  told  him  as  follows:  The  previous  night,  October  21,
Schultz  was  in  the  defendant’s  house  at  217  Elm  Street.  The
three
defendant  gave  her  cocaine.  Schultz  also  saw 
cellophane  bags  containing  cocaine 
the  defendant’s
bedroom.
The warrant was issued and a search of 217 Elm Street was
conducted on October 22. The search turned up a quantity of
marijuana  but  no  cocaine.  The  defendant  was  arrested  and
charged with possession of marijuana. The defendant moved
to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence, contending
that Susie Schultz was not in 217 Elm Street on October 21 or
at any other time.

in 

If,  after  hearing  evidence,  the  judge  concludes  that  the
statement  in  the  application  attributed  to  Susie  Schultz  is
incorrect, the judge should grant the motion to suppress

(A)  because the application contains a material statement that

is false.

(B)    because  of  the  false  statement  and  because  no  cocaine

was found in the house.

(C)  only if he also finds that Susie Schultz’s statement was a

deliberate lie.

(D)    only  if  he  also  finds  that  the  officer  knew  the  statement

was false.

Answer  3:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  exclusionary  rule
provides  that  evidence  obtained  by  violating  the  defendant’s
constitutional rights may not be introduced by the prosecution,

403

at  least  for  purposes  of  providing  direct  proof  of  the
defendant’s guilt. The exclusionary rule does not bar evidence
that was obtained by officers acting in reasonable reliance on
a search warrant issued by a proper magistrate but ultimately
found  to  be  unsupported  by  probable  cause.  U.S.  v.  Leon
(1984). This good-faith exception will not apply if the officer
who  prepared  the  affidavit  on  which  the  warrant  is  based
knows  that  the  information  in  it  is  false  or  recklessly
disregards  its  truth  or  falsity.  Therefore,  the  motion  to
suppress should be granted under these circumstances.

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  is  irrelevant  that  there  was  a  false
material  statement  in  the  application,  as  long  as  the  police
officers  acted  in  reasonable  reliance  upon  it.  The  informant
was described as a cocaine user who had previously supplied
accurate  information  concerning  the  use  of  cocaine  in  the
community; she also supplied detailed information about how
she  came  upon  the  information  which  she  supplied  to  the
police. It was reasonable for the police to rely on the warrant
that was based on this information offered by this informant.
And  under  U.S.  v.  Leon,  supra,  the  evidence  obtained  by
reasonable  reliance  on  a  search  warrant  is  not  excludible
even though there was not in fact probable cause for issuance
of the warrant. (See the analysis of Choice (D) above.)
(B) is wrong because not only is it irrelevant that there was a
false statement in the application, but it is also irrelevant that
no  cocaine  was  found  in  the  house,  as  long  as  the  police
officers acted in reasonable reliance upon the warrant. There
was  reasonable  reliance  on  the  warrant  as  explained  in  the
discussion of Choice (A).

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  nature  of  the  false  statement  is
irrelevant, as long as the police officers acted in reasonable
reliance upon the warrant. There was reasonable reliance on
the warrant, as explained in the discussion of Choice (A).

404

CHAPTER 2
WARRANTLESS ARRESTS AND
SEARCHES

I.    SEARCH INCIDENT TO ARREST

A.  Protective sweep

1.  Can’t search too-small spaces

Question 4: The police had, over time, accumulated reliable
information  that  a  rock  singer  operated  a  large  cocaine-
distribution  network,  that  he  and  his  accomplices  often
resorted  to  violence,  and  that  they  kept  a  small  arsenal  of
weapons in his home.
One day, the police received reliable information that a large
brown  suitcase  with  leather  straps  containing  a  supply  of
cocaine  had  been  delivered  to  the  singer’s  home  and  that  it
would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The
police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize
the  brown  suitcase  and  the  cocaine  and  went  to  the  singer’s
house.

The  police  knocked  on  the  singer’s  door  and  called  out,
“Police.  Open  up.  We  have  a  search  warrant.”  After  a  few
seconds  with  no  response,  the  police  forced  the  door  open
and  entered.  Hearing  noises  in  the  basement,  the  police  ran
down there and found the singer with a large brown suitcase
with leather straps. They seized the suitcase and put handcuffs
on the singer. A search of his person revealed a switchblade
knife and a .45-caliber pistol.
The police then fanned out through the house, looking in every
room  and  closet.  They  found  no  one  else,  but  one  officer
found an Uzi automatic weapon in a box on a closet shelf in
the singer’s bedroom.

In addition to charges relating to the cocaine in the suitcase,
the singer is charged with unlawful possession of weapons.
The singer moves pretrial to suppress the use as evidence of
the  Uzi  automatic  weapon.  The  singer’s  motion  to  suppress

405

should be

(A)  granted, because the search exceeded the scope needed to

find out if other persons were present.

(B)    granted,  because  once  the  object  of  the  warrant — the
brown suitcase — had been found and seized, no further
search of the house is permitted.

(C)  denied, because the police were lawfully in the bedroom
and  the  weapon  was  immediately  identifiable  as  being
subject to seizure.

(D)  denied, because the police were lawfully in the house and
had probable cause to believe that weapons were in the
house.

Answer 4: Choice (A) is correct. Incident to a lawful arrest
in an arrestee’s home, the officers executing the warrant may
conduct a “protective sweep” of all or part of the premises, if
they have a “reasonable belief” that another person who might
be  dangerous  to  the  officers  may  be  present  in  the  areas
swept. Maryland v. Buie (1990). So here, the police had the
right to search the house for accomplices. The Uzi, however,
was found in a box on a closet shelf. Clearly the weapon was
neither in plain sight nor in a place where a person could be
found.  Therefore,  the  protective-sweep  exception  doesn’t
apply.  Since  the  search  warrant  covered  only  the  brown
suitcase (which the police had already seized), their search of
the closet could not be justified on the grounds that they were
executing the search warrant either.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  answer  misstates  the  applicable
law:  The  police  had  the  right  to  search  the  house  for
accomplices.  As  is  described  in  the  analysis  of  Choice  (A)
above, the police had the right to check protectively for other
persons. Therefore, this choice — since it says that no further
search  of  the  house  was  permitted  once  the  suitcase  was
seized — is  inconsistent  with  the  officers’  right  to  make  the
protective  search  (which  may  be  made  at  any  time  that  the
police  are  still  on  the  premises  and  are  thus  vulnerable  to  a
sudden attack from someone who might be hiding).
(C)  is  wrong  because  the  weapon  was  not  in  an  area  that
could  be  searched.  It’s  true  that  the  police  were  lawfully  in

406

the bedroom (under their right to make a protective sweep — 
see  Choice  (A)).  But  while  they  were  in  the  bedroom,  the
police were only permitted to look in places where a person
might  be  hiding.  They  therefore  weren’t  allowed  to  look  in
small boxes, as they did here.

(D) is wrong because, while the police knew that there might
well  be  weapons  in  the  house,  they  would  have  needed  a
warrant  in  order  to  look  for  such  weapons  at  the  top  of  the
closet.  There  are  two  requirements  that  must  be  satisfied
before a house may be searched for a particular item, unless
there  is  some  applicable  exception:  (1)  probable  cause  to
believe  that  the  item  will  be  found;  and  (2)  a  warrant  to
search for it. Here, since the facts tell us that the police had
gotten reliable information that the singer and his accomplices
“kept  a  small  arsenal  of  weapons  in  [the  singer’s]  home,”
requirement (1) was satisfied as to the weapons. But although
the  police  procured  a  search  warrant,  that  warrant  did  not
cover  the  weapons,  only  the  brown  suitcase.  Therefore,  the
fact that the police were already in the home, and the further
fact that they had probable cause to believe that the weapons
would or might be found, were not enough to permit them to
look  either  in  the  bedroom  or  in  the  closet.  And  while  their
need to make a “protective sweep” justified them in looking
in  the  bedroom,  this  need  did  not,  as  described  in  the
discussion of Choice (A), authorize them to search in a small
box on a shelf, since no one could have been hiding there.

II.   AUTOMOBILE SEARCHES

A.  Two special exceptions

1.  Field search for contraband

Question 5: Police received information from an undercover
police  officer  that  she  had  just  seen  two  men  (whom  she
described)  in  a  red  pickup  truck  selling  marijuana  to
schoolchildren  near  the  city’s  largest  high  school.  A  few
minutes  later,  two  police  officers  saw  a  pickup  truck  fitting
the description a half block from the high school. The driver
of  the  truck  matched  the  description  of  one  of  the  men
described by the undercover officer.

407

The only passenger was a young woman who was in the back
of the truck. The police saw her get out and stand at a nearby
bus stop. They stopped the truck and asked the driver to exit
the car; they then searched the driver’s person. In the pocket
of the driver’s jacket, the police found a small bottle of pills
that they recognized as narcotics. They arrested the driver and
handcuffed him to the back of the police car. The police then
broke  open  a  locked  toolbox  attached  to  the  flatbed  of  the
truck and found a small sealed envelope inside. They opened
it and found marijuana. They also found a quantity of cocaine
in the glove compartment.

After completing their search of the driver and the truck, the
police went over to the young woman and searched her purse.
In  her  purse,  they  found  a  small  quantity  of  heroin.  Both  the
driver and the young woman were arrested and charged with
unlawful possession of narcotics.

If  the  driver  moves  to  suppress  the  use  as  evidence  of  the
marijuana  and  cocaine  found  in  the  search  of  the  truck,  the
court should
(A)  grant the motion as to both the marijuana and the cocaine.
(B)  grant the motion as to the marijuana but deny it as to the

cocaine.

(C)  deny the motion as to the marijuana but grant it as to the

cocaine.

(D)  deny the motion as to both the marijuana and the cocaine.
Answer 5: Choice (D) is correct. The court should deny the
driver’s motion to suppress both types of evidence since the
search  that  allowed  the  police  to  find  the  drugs  was
conducted  properly.  Generally, 
the  Fourth  Amendment
requires  that  police  have  a  warrant  to  search  a  person  or
location.  There  are  many  exceptions  to  this  rule,  several  of
which involve the searches of automobiles. In particular, the
police could search the driver’s car without a warrant if they
had probable cause to believe that it contained contraband or
evidence of a crime. (California v. Carney (1985).) Since the
officers  who  stopped  the  car  were  informed  by  another
officer  that,  only  a  few  minutes  earlier,  the  occupants  of  the
truck  had  been  observed  selling  marijuana,  the  arresting

408

officers had probable cause to search the driver’s person for
drugs.  Once  they  found  drugs  on  the  driver,  they  then  had
probable  cause  (which  they  may  even  have  had  before  the
stop) to believe that the truck would contain drugs. Given that
belief, they were entitled to search the car for drugs, without
first getting a warrant.

Once  we  have  determined  that  the  search  was  allowed,  we
need  to  check  whether  the  scope  of  the  search  was  proper.
When  the  police  stop  a  vehicle  and  have  probable  cause  to
believe that contraband is contained in it, they may search any
container that could possibly contain the object of the search.
(U.S. v. Ross  (1982).)  Since  the  officers  were  searching  the
driver’s truck for evidence of a recent drug sale, the object of
the search was marijuana, which can be stored in very small
containers.  Both  the  glove  compartment  of  the  truck  and  the
toolbox in the flatbed were large enough to contain the drugs,
so the police could lawfully search them without a warrant.

Notice that this is not a case in which the driver is benefited
by Arizona v. Gant (2009), where the Court held that the mere
fact that a driver has been arrested for, say, a traffic violation
does  not  automatically  entitle  the  police  to  do  a  complete
search  of  the  passenger  compartment.  Here,  by  the  time  the
police  started  their  search  of  the  truck  itself  (as  opposed  to
the  driver’s  person),  they  already  had  probable  cause  to
believe  that  the  truck  would  contain  evidence  of  narcotics
possession, the offense for which they had arrested the driver.
So  they  were  entitled  to  search  the  truck’s  passenger
compartment  for  drugs.  That  probable  cause  to  believe  that
drugs  would  be  found  in  the  car  makes  the  constitutional
difference.  For  instance,  suppose  the  police  had  merely
stopped  the  truck  for,  say,  a  traffic  violation,  arrested  the
driver  for  that  violation  and  handcuffed  him,  and  then  did  a
search  of  the  passenger  compartment  incident  to  arrest,
without  any  probable  cause  to  believe  that  drugs  or
contraband would be found within the truck. In this situation,
Gant  would  have  made  the  search  of  the  truck  illegal.  But
here,  since  the  police  already  had  appropriately  obtained
probable cause to suspect that the truck would contain drugs
prior to the moment when they started the truck search, Gant

409

is irrelevant, and the search was proper.

Choices (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they wrongly
conclude that the police improperly searched either the glove
compartment or the toolbox.

III.   CONSENT SEARCHES GENERALLY

A.  Consent generally

Question 6:  Police  officers  received  a  tip  that  drug  dealing
was  occurring  at  a  certain  ground-floor  duplex  apartment.
They  decided  to  stake  out  the  apartment.  The  stakeout
revealed  that  a  significant  number  of  people  visited  the
apartment for short periods of time and then left. A man exited
the apartment and started to walk briskly away. The officers
grabbed the man and, when he struggled, wrestled him to the
ground. They searched him and found a bag of heroin in one
of  his  pockets.  After  discovering  the  heroin  on  the  man,  the
police  decided  to  enter  the  apartment.  They  knocked  on  the
door, which was opened by the woman who lived there. The
police asked if they could come inside, and the woman gave
them permission to do so. Once inside, the officers observed
several bags of heroin on the living room table. The woman is
charged  with  possession  of  the  heroin  found  on  the  living
room table. She moves pretrial to suppress the heroin on the
ground that it was obtained by virtue of an illegal search and
seizure.

Should the woman’s motion be granted?

(A)  No, because the tip together with the heroin found in the
man’s pocket provided probable cause for the search.
(B)  No, because the woman consented to the officers’ entry.
(C)  Yes, because the officers’ decision to enter the house was

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

the fruit of an illegal search of the man.

(D)  Yes, because the officers did not inform the woman that

she could refuse consent.

Answer  6:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  woman’s  consent
justified  the  officers’  entry.  When  a  person  consents  to  the
entry of law enforcement officers into an area as to which the
person  would  otherwise  have  a  justifiable  expectation  of

410

privacy,  that  consent  validates  the  police  entry,  and  nullifies
any need for either probable cause or a search warrant if such
a need existed prior to the consent. Once the police then make
their  consented-to  entry,  the  “plain  view”  doctrine  entitles
them to seize any item whose contraband or evidentiary nature
is obvious, as long as when they have the view the police are
standing  in  a  place  where  they  have  a  right  to  be.  Harris  v.
U.S. (1968). Since the woman consented to the officers’ entry
into her house, and since the officers spotted the heroin while
standing in a place to which the consent applied, there could
not have been either an illegal search or an illegal seizure.

(A) is wrong because, while this answer correctly states that
the  woman’s  motion  to  suppress  the  heroin  should  not  be
granted, it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. Even
assuming  there  was  probable  cause  to  search  the  home,  a
warrant  would  have  been  required  for  entry  had  the  woman
not consented. See, e.g., Payton v. New York (1980).

(C) is wrong because the search of the man, even assuming it
was  improper,  did  not  violate  the  woman’s  rights  and
therefore provides no basis for suppressing evidence found in
her  house.  That  is,  the  woman  did  not  have  “standing”  to
assert a violation of the constitutional rights of a third party.
Cf.  Minnesota  v.  Carter  (1998)  (discussing  standing
requirements for third-party constitutional claims).

(D)  is  wrong  because  there  is  no  requirement  that  officers
inform  individuals  of  their  right  to  refuse  consent.  See
Schneckloth  v.  Bustamonte  (1973).  Therefore,  the  consent
was valid.

B.  D need not know he can refuse consent

1.  Must be voluntary

a.  Ignorance of police motive

Question 7:  Larson  was  charged  with  the  murder  of  a  man
who had been strangled and whose body was found in some
woods  near  his  home.  Larson  suffers  from  a  neurological
problem  that  makes  it  impossible  for  him  to  remember  an
occurrence for longer than 48 hours.

After Larson was charged, the police visited him and asked if

411

they  might  search  his  home.  Larson  consented.  The  police
found a diary written by Larson. An entry dated the same day
as 
“Indescribable
excitement. Why did no one ever tell me that killing gave such
pleasure to the master?”

the  victim’s  disappearance 

read, 

Larson was charged with murder. His attorney has moved to
exclude  the  diary  from  evidence  on  the  ground  that  its
admission  would  violate  Larson’s  privilege  against  self-
incrimination. Counsel has also argued that Larson could not
give  informed  consent  to  the  search  because  more  than  48
hours had passed since the making of the entry and hence he
could not remember the existence of the incriminating entry at
the  time  he  gave  his  consent.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the
police  officers  who  secured  Larson’s  consent  to  the  search
were aware of his memory impairment.

With regard to the diary, the court should

(A)    admit  it,  because  Larson’s  consent  was  not  obtained  by
intentional  police  misconduct  and  Larson  was  not
compelled to make the diary entry.

(B)    admit  it,  pursuant  to  the  good-faith  exception  to  the

exclusionary rule.

(C)  exclude it, because Larson was not competent to consent

to a search.

(D)    exclude  it,  because  use  of  the  diary  as  evidence  would

violate Larson’s

                    privilege against self-incrimination.
Answer  7:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  police  may  make  a
constitutional warrantless search if they receive the consent of
the  individual  whose  premises,  effects  or  person  are  to  be
searched.  The  police  did  not  deceive  Larson  nor  make  any
misrepresentations  in  order  to  obtain  his  consent.  Nor  did
they  compel  him  to  make  the  diary  entry,  a  requirement  in
order  for  him  to  claim  that  his  Fifth  Amendment  privilege
against  self-incrimination  was  violated,  as  discussed  more
fully  in  the  analysis  of  (D).  Therefore,  the  diary  should  be
admitted.
(B)  is  wrong  because  the  “good  faith”  exception  to  the
exclusionary rule does not apply in this context, nor is it even

412

necessary to rely on an exception, since the search and seizure
were  valid.  The  exclusionary  rule  provides  that  evidence
obtained by violating the defendant’s constitutional rights may
not be introduced by the prosecution, at least for purposes of
providing  direct  proof  of 
the  defendant’s  guilt.  The
exclusionary rule does not bar evidence that was obtained by
officers  acting  in  reasonable  reliance  on  a  search  warrant
issued  by  a  proper  magistrate  but  ultimately  found  to  be
unsupported by probable cause (“good faith” exception). U.S.
v.  Leon  (1984).  There  was  no  warrant  issued  in  this  case;
therefore,  the  concept  is  misapplied  here.  In  addition,  the
diary  is  admissible  without  reliance  on  an  exception  to  the
exclusionary rule, because of Larson’s consent, as discussed
in the explanation to (A).

(C)  is  wrong  because  Larson’s  disability  did  not  affect  his
ability  to  understand  the  nature  of  his  consent.  It’s  true  that
Larson could not remember things that happened more than 48
hours  previously,  so  that  he  did  not  remember  making  the
diary  entry.  However,  what  is  relevant  is  that  he  was  fully
competent to understand the consequences of his consent to a
present search of his home. Therefore, the consent was valid.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  police  did  not  compel  the
production of the diary, nor would evidence of a diary entry
be  considered  “testimonial  or  communicative.”  The  Fifth
Amendment  privilege  against  self-incrimination  protects
against  compulsion  to  give  “testimonial  or  communicative”
evidence.  Larson  consented  to  the  search  without  any
compulsion  on  the  part  of  the  police.  Additionally,  Larson’s
intended  as  a
earlier  writing  of 
communication (the fact pattern does not indicate that it was
intended to be anything other than a private writing meant to
be read only by Larson) and would therefore not be covered
under the privilege for that reason as well.

IV.  INSPECTIONS AND WEAPONS SEARCHES

A.  Searches in schools

1.  Law enforcement agencies involved

Question 8: The police suspected that Yancey, a 16-year-old

413

high  school  student,  had  committed  a  series  of  burglaries.
Two  officers  went  to  Yancey’s  high  school  and  asked  the
principal  to  call  Yancey  out  of  class  and  to  search  his
backpack.  While  the  officers  waited,  the  principal  took
Yancey into the hall where she asked to look in his backpack.
When  Yancey  refused,  the  principal  grabbed  it  from  him,
injuring  Yancey’s  shoulder  in  the  process.  In  the  backpack,
she found jewelry that she turned over to the officers.

Yancey  was  charged  with  the  burglaries,  and  moves  to
suppress the use of the jewelry.

The court should

(A)    deny  the  motion  on  the  ground  that  the  search  was

incident to a lawful arrest.

(B)    deny  the  motion  on  the  ground  that  school  searches  are
reasonable  if  conducted  by  school  personnel  on  school
grounds on the basis of reasonable suspicion.

(C)    grant  the  motion  on  the  ground  that  the  search  was

conducted with excessive force.

(D)    grant  the  motion  on  the  ground  that  the  search  was

conducted without probable cause or a warrant.

Answer 8: Choice (D) is correct. School officials may search
the person and property of a student without a warrant if there
is “reasonable ground for suspecting that the search will turn
up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either
the  law  or  the  rules  of  the  school.”  New  Jersey  v.  T.L.O.
(1985).  However,  this  rule  almost  certainly  doesn’t  apply
where the school authorities are performing the search at the
express  request  of  the  police.  Consequently,  the  usual
requirement  of  probable  cause  for  a  search,  plus  the
requirement  of  a  search  warrant,  apply  if  there  is  no  other
applicable exception to these requirements. There is no such
exception to either of these requirements on these facts.
(A)  is  wrong  because  a  search  incident  to  an  arrest  must  be
made incident to a valid arrest, supported by probable cause.
The facts do not offer a basis on which probable cause could
have  been  found,  only  a  vague  reference  that  the  police
“suspected”  Yancey.  Additionally,  the  search  here  happened
before  the  arrest;  a  valid  search  incident  to  an  arrest  occurs

414

after the arrest has been made.

(B) is wrong because, while it’s true that school officials may
search the person and property of a student without a warrant
if  there  is  “reasonable  ground  for  suspecting  that  the  search
will  turn  up  evidence  that  the  student  has  violated  or  is
violating  either  the  law  or  the  rules  of  the  school,”  (N.J.  v.
T.L.O., supra) this rule doesn’t apply here. That’s because the
principal  was  acting  at  the  specific  behest  of  the  police.
Consequently,  the  search  had  to  meet  the  same  requirements
as  a  police  search  (including  satisfaction  of  the  warrant
requirement),  and 
the  search
wouldn’t be enough to validate it.

the  “reasonableness”  of 

(C) is wrong because there is no “excessive force” basis for
excluding the fruits of a search.

CHAPTER 3
CONFESSIONS AND POLICE
INTERROGATION

I.    VOLUNTARINESS

A.  Voluntariness generally

1.  Must be police coercion

Question  9:  Dan  entered  the  police  station  and  announced
that he wanted to confess to a murder. The police advised Dan
of the Miranda  warnings,  and  Dan  signed  a  written  waiver.
Dan  described  the  murder  in  detail  and  pinpointed  the
location where a murder victim had been found a few weeks
before.  Later,  a  court-appointed  psychiatrist  determined  that
Dan was suffering from a serious mental illness that interfered
with his ability to make rational choices and to understand his
rights and that the psychosis had induced his confession.

Dan’s confession is

(A)    admissible,  because  there  was  no  coercive  police

conduct in obtaining Dan’s statement.
(B)  admissible, because Dan was not in custody.
(C)  inadmissible, because Dan’s confession was a product of

his mental illness and was therefore involuntary.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  under  these  circumstances,  there

was no valid waiver of Miranda warnings.

Answer  9:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Dan’s  confession  is
admissible  because  it  was  made  voluntarily  after  he  had
validly  waived  his  Fifth  Amendment  right  against  self-
incrimination. A confession may only be introduced against a
defendant  if  it  meets  two  criteria.  First,  the  defendant  must
have made the confession voluntarily. This hurdle is very easy
to  clear  since  a  statement  is  considered  “voluntary”  unless
there is evidence of police coercion. Nothing the police did in
this  situation  forced  Dan  to  confess,  so  his  statement  was
voluntary.  (As  discussed  in  Choice  (C)  below,  the  Supreme
Court has held that a suspect’s mental illness, standing alone,

416

will  not  result  in  a  statement  being  considered  involuntary.)
Second, the confession must be made in accordance with the
decision in Miranda, which requires that the suspect be given
“Miranda warnings” and have validly waived them before he
is questioned by law enforcement authorities. A waiver of the
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Sixth
Amendment  right  to  have  counsel  present  at  questioning  is
valid only if it is made “knowingly and intelligently.” To meet
this  standard,  the  prosecution  must  show  that  (1)  the  suspect
knew what his rights were when he waived them, and (2) he
understood that he was giving up those rights. “Intelligence,”
for  the  purposes  of  waiver  analysis,  has  nothing  to  do  with
whether  the  suspect  was  making  a  wise  decision.  Dan  was
given his Miranda  warnings  and  signed  a  written  waiver  of
his rights before confessing. Since there is no evidence that he
was  coerced  into  signing  the  waiver,  the  waiver  was  valid
and the confession is admissible against him.

(B) is wrong because Dan was in custody when he confessed.
A  defendant  is  in  custody  when  police  action  has  restricted
his  “freedom  of  action 
in  any  significant  way.”  The
“reasonable suspect” test is used to determine if a defendant
is in custody. The issue is whether a reasonable person in the
suspect’s position would believe that he would be allowed to
leave.  Dan  had  already  walked  into  a  police  station  and
announced  that  he  wanted  to  confess  to  murder.  Since  a
reasonable person would believe that the police would not let
him  simply  walk  out  of  the  station  after  making  such  an
announcement, Dan was in custody at that point.

(C)  is  wrong  because  Dan’s  mental  illness  did  not  render
either  his  confession  or  his  waiver  of  his  Miranda  rights
involuntary. The issue is not whether the decision to confess
was  rational,  but  rather  whether  it  was  made  of  Dan’s  free
will. The Supreme Court has held that a mentally ill suspect’s
decision to confess and waive his Miranda rights, no matter
is  voluntary  absent  police  coercion.
how 
(Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157 (1986).)
(D)  is  wrong  because  Dan’s  waiver  of  his  Miranda  rights
was  valid.  As  discussed  above,  a  suspect’s  mental  illness
does not render his waiver invalid. Additionally, it should be

irrational, 

417

noted that express, written waivers are almost always valid,
absent some evidence of police trickery or coercion.

II.   WHAT CONSTITUTES INTERROGATION

A.  Volunteered statements

1.  Voluntary custodial statements

Question  10:  A  grand  jury  indicted  Alice  on  a  charge  of
arson, and a valid warrant was issued for her arrest. Paul, a
police  officer,  arrested  Alice  and  informed  her  of  what  the
warrant  stated.  However,  hoping  that  Alice  might  say
something  incriminating,  he  did  not  give  her  Miranda
warnings. He placed her in the back seat of his patrol car and
was driving her to the police station when she said, “Look. I
didn’t mean to burn the building; it was an accident. I was just
burning some papers in a wastebasket.”
At  the  station,  after  being  given  Miranda  warnings,  Alice
stated  she  wished  to  remain  silent  and  made  no  other
statements.
Alice  moved  to  suppress  the  use  of  her  statement  to  Paul  as
evidence  on  two  grounds:  first,  that  the  statement  was
acquired without giving Miranda warnings, and second, that
the  police  officer  had  deliberately  elicited  her  incriminating
statement after she was in custody.

As to Alice’s motion to suppress, the court should

(A)  deny the motion.
(B)    grant  the  motion  only  on  the  basis  of  the  first  ground

stated.

(C)    grant  the  motion  only  on  the  basis  of  the  second  ground

stated.

(D)  grant the motion on either ground.
Answer  10:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  court  should  deny
Alice’s motion to suppress her statement because she wasn’t
being  interrogated  when  she  said  it.  Alice  argues  that  her
statement  should  be  suppressed  on  two  different  grounds,  so
we should examine them separately.
First,  Alice  claims  that  because  her  statement  was  given

418

before she had been read her Miranda warnings, it should not
be admissible. Therefore, the question becomes, at what point
must  a  police  officer  give  a  suspect  Miranda  warnings?
Miranda  only  applies  if  three  requirements  have  been  met:
(1)  the  defendant  has  been  taken  into  custody,  (2)  the
confession  was  given  in  response  questioning,  and  (3)  the
interrogation  was  conducted  by  the  police.  If  all  three
conditions  are  met,  then  any  confession  may  not  be  admitted
unless the police have informed the defendant that she had the
right  to  remain  silent,  that  anything  she  said  could  be  used
against her in a court of law, that she had the right to have an
attorney present at questioning, and that if she could not afford
an  attorney,  one  would  be  appointed  for  her  before
questioning  if  she  wished.  In  this  case,  Alice,  having  been
arrested  and  put  into  a  police  car,  was  certainly  in  custody,
since  a  defendant  is  considered  in  custody  for  Miranda
purposes when a reasonable suspect in her position would not
believe she was free to leave. But although Paul believed that
Alice  might  say  something  incriminating  while  in  the  patrol
car,  he  neither  said  nor  did  anything  to  her  other  than  what
was required to arrest her and take her into custody. Since, as
discussed below, Paul did nothing that was reasonably likely
to  elicit  an  incriminating  response  from  Alice,  there  was  no
“interrogation” that would trigger Alice’s right to be read her
Miranda warnings.

Second,  Alice  claims  that  Paul  had  deliberately  elicited  the
incriminating statement she made while in the patrol car. The
Miranda Court specifically said that “volunteered statements
of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their
admissibility  is  not  affected  by  our  holding.”  The  question
now  becomes  what,  if  anything,  did  Paul  do  that  would  be
considered  an  “interrogation,”  rendering  Alice’s  statement
non-voluntary? The Supreme Court has held that, in addition
to  direct  questioning  of  a  suspect,  an  interrogation  has  taken
place whenever the police do anything that they should know
is  reasonably  likely  to  elicit  an  incriminating  response  from
the  suspect.  Here,  Alice  argues  that  arresting  her  for  arson
and  putting  her  in  the  patrol  car  was  enough  to  be  the
functional  equivalent  of  questioning.  However,  that  police
conduct  was  insufficient  to  constitute  interrogation  without

419

some further act by Paul, since “officers do not interrogate a
suspect  simply  by  hoping  that  he  will  incriminate  himself.”
Arizona v. Mauro (1987).

Choices (B), (C), and (D) are wrong because they contradict
the analysis given above.

B.  Police allow situation to develop

1.  Police set up situation

Question  11:  The  police  suspected  that  Yancey,  a  16-year-
old high school student, had committed a series of burglaries.
They  arrested  Yancey,  took  him  to  the  station,  and  gave  him
Miranda warnings. Yancey asked to see a lawyer. The police
called Yancey’s parents to the station. When Yancey’s parents
arrived, the police asked them to speak with Yancey. They put
them in a room and secretly recorded their conversation with
a  concealed  electronic  device.  Yancey  broke  down  and
confessed to his parents that he had committed the burglaries.

Yancey was charged with the burglaries.

Yancey  moves  to  suppress  the  use  of  the  statement  Yancey
made to his parents.

The best argument for excluding it would be

(A)    Yancey  was  in  custody  at  the  time  the  statement  was

recorded.

(B)    the  police  did  not  comply  with  Yancey’s  request  for  a

lawyer.

(C)    once  Yancey  had  invoked  his  right  to  counsel,  it  was
improper  for  the  police  to  listen  to  any  of  his  private
conversations.

(D)  the meeting between Yancey and his parents was arranged
by the police to obtain an incriminating statement.
Answer 11: Choice (D) is correct. Once Yancey asked for a
lawyer,  no  “interrogation”  could  occur  until  the  police
provided one. Interrogation, for purposes of Miranda, occurs
“whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express
questioning or its functional equivalent . . . words or actions
on  the  part  of  police  that  the  police  should  know  are
reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the
suspect.” Rhode Island v. Innis (1980).

420

If the police conduct merely consists of arranging a situation
in  which  the  police  believe  it  likely  that  the  defendant  may
volunteer  an  incriminating  remark,  there  is  no  interrogation,
because  “officers  do  not  interrogate  a  suspect  simply  by
hoping  that  he  will  incriminate  himself.”  Arizona  v.  Mauro
(1987).  However,  if  the  arrangement  involves  sending  in  a
trusted  person  to  speak  to  the  defendant  alone  and  secretly
recording  the  conversation,  this  would  likely  constitute
interrogation. The police asked Yancey’s parents to speak to
him and then listened in secretly. This is a situation where the
police  should  know 
that  an
incriminating remark will be elicited. Therefore, interrogation
occurred  and  the  statement  should  be  suppressed  because  it
was obtained in violation of Yancey’s Miranda rights.

is  reasonably 

likely 

it 

(A) is wrong because, regardless of the fact that Yancey was
in  custody  at  the  time,  it  still  needs  to  be  established  that
Yancey  was  interrogated  in  order  for  the  statement  to  be
suppressed. This is the case, as discussed in the explanation
to Choice (D).

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  police  don’t  have  to  provide  a
lawyer as long as the suspect is not interrogated. The essence
of  the  warning  about  an  attorney  is  not  that  a  suspect  has  an
automatic right to have the police provide him with a lawyer
while they hold him in custody — all the police must do is to
choose  between  providing  a  lawyer  or  questioning,  so  they
are always free to defer their questioning until some later date
if they can’t (or don’t want to) provide a lawyer. Therefore,
the  fact  that  a  lawyer  was  not  procured  is  not  significant  by
itself. It is significant because, despite the fact that a lawyer
was  not  procured,  Yancey  was  subject  to  interrogation,  as
explained in the discussion of Choice D.
(C)  is  wrong  because  it  is  not  true  that  the  police  may  not
listen to any of Yancey’s private conversations. The argument
for  exclusion  of  the  statement  is  based  on  the  fact  that
Yancey’s  Miranda  rights  were  violated  because  he  was  in
custody and was subjected to interrogation despite his request
for  an  attorney.  The  police  were  permitted  to  eavesdrop  on
Yancey’s  conversations  while  he  was  in  custody,  as  long  as
the statements he made were not in response to interrogation

LINEUPS AND OTHER PRE-TRIAL
IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES

I.    THE PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-

INCRIMINATION

A.  General rule

1.  Other procedures

Question  12:  A  defendant  was  lawfully  arrested  without  a
warrant  for  bank  robbery.  He  was  not  given  Miranda
warnings,  but  was  immediately  taken  to  a  police  station
where  he  and  five  other  men  were  placed  in  a  lineup  to  be
viewed by the bank teller. Each man was required to say the
words spoken by the bank robber: “Give me all your money.
I’ve  got  a  gun.”  After  all  the  men  in  the  lineup  spoke  those
words, the teller identified the defendant as the robber.

The defendant subsequently moved to suppress the testimony
of the teller, claiming the lineup violated his privilege against
self-incrimination.  At  a  suppression  hearing,  the  teller
testified  that  she  had  not  gotten  a  good  look  at  the  robber’s
face, because the robber had been wearing a hat pulled down
over most of his face, but that she was certain the defendant
was  the  robber  because  she  had  recognized  his  voice  at  the
lineup.

Should the defendant’s motion be granted?

(A)  No, because being required to speak at the lineup, while
compelled, was not testimonial or communicative.
(B)    No,  because  testimony  of  a  witness  based  on  firsthand
observation is not subject to exclusion as the fruit of the
poisonous tree.

(C)  Yes, because the defendant was compelled to speak at the
lineup,  and  this  compelled  speech  led  to  the  witness’s
identification testimony.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  defendant  was  never  informed  that  he
could  refuse  to  make  a  statement  and  that  any  statement

423

could be used as evidence against him.

Compulsory 

Answer 12: Choice (A) is correct. The privilege against self-
to  compelled  “testimonial”
incrimination  extends  only 
communications. 
physical-identification
procedures,  like  being  forced  to  give  fingerprints,  blood
samples, voice prints, and the like, have been held not to be
“testimonial,” because the accused is not being asked to make
statements  that  have  communicative  value.  See,  e.g.,  United
States  v.  Hubbell  (2000):  “Thus,  even  though  the  act  may
provide  incriminating  evidence,  a  criminal  suspect  may  be
compelled . . . to make a recording of his voice.” So here, the
defendant  could  properly  be  required  to  utter  the  words
spoken  by  the  bank  robber,  since  those  words  were  being
used merely to help the victim identify which of the men in the
lineup was the robber, not for the communicative value of the
words being spoken.
(B) is wrong because it is both overbroad and not applicable
to  these  facts.  Why  is  it  overly  broad?  There  is  some
testimony  based  on  first-hand  observation  that  is  subject  to
exclusion  as  the  fruit  of  the  poisonous  tree:  If  a  law
enforcement officer gets the opportunity to make a first-hand
observation  as  the  direct  result  of  police  illegality,  then  his
testimony  based  on  that  observation  will  be  excludable  as
fruit  of  the  poisonous  tree.  So,  for  instance,  if  the  officer
breaks into D’s house without a warrant and without probable
cause,  and  while  there  secretly  listens  to  D  making  a
confession  of  crime  to  D’s  wife,  the  officer  would  not  be
permitted  to  testify  to  what  he  heard,  because  his  first-hand
observation  is  the  fruit  of  the  poisonous  tree  (the  illegal
break-in).
Nor  is  the  statement  in  this  choice  applicable  to  these  facts 
— since  the  teller’s  testimony  here  is  based  on  the  teller’s
own first-hand observation, and the teller got that observation
without  any 
the
principle stated in this choice would not apply even if it was
an accurate statement of the law.
(C)  is  wrong  for  the  same  reason  that  (A)  is  right:  The
privilege against self-incrimination extends only to compelled
“testimonial” communications, and being compelled to supply

law-enforcement  procedures, 

improper 

424

a voice sample or other form of physical identification is not
testimonial.

(D)  is  wrong  because  Miranda  did  not  apply  to  these  facts.
Miranda  warnings  are  designed  to  protect  the  suspect’s
ability  to  exercise  his  privilege  against  self-incrimination.
The need to supply Miranda  warnings  is  therefore  triggered
only  when  the  suspect  is  being  subjected  to  custodial
“interrogation,”  meaning  that  the  suspect  in  custody  is  being
asked questions in an attempt to elicit communications. When
the  defendant  here  was  asked  to  repeat  the  words  from  the
holdup,  he  was  not  being  asked  to  communicate  or  give
“testimonial”-type information, but rather, to supply a form of
physical  identification.  Therefore,  Miranda  warnings  were
not required.

Question  13:  Devlin  was  charged  with  murder.  Several
witnesses testified that the crime was committed by a person
of  Devlin’s  general  description  who  walked  with  a  severe
limp. Devlin in fact walks with a severe limp. He objected to
a prosecution request that the court order him to walk across
the courtroom in order to display his limp to the jury to assist
it  in  determining  whether  Devlin  was  the  person  that  the
witnesses had seen.

Devlin’s objection will most likely be
(A)    sustained,  because  the  order  sought  by  the  prosecution
self-

would  violate  Devlin’s  privilege 
incrimination.

against 

(B)    sustained,  because  the  order  sought  by  the  prosecution

would constitute an illegal search and seizure.

(C)  denied, because the order sought by the prosecution is a
legitimate  part  of  a  proper  courtroom  identification
process.

(D)    denied,  because  a  criminal  defendant  has  no  legitimate

expectation of privacy.

Answer  13:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  Fifth  Amendment
protects only against the compulsion of “communications” or
“testimony”  (privilege  against  self-incrimination)  and  not
against  “compulsion  which  makes  a  suspect  or  accused  the
source  of  ‘real  or  physical  evidence’.”  Schmerber  v.

425

California (1966). In U.S. v. Wade (1967), the Court said that
the privilege did not apply to a defendant forced to appear in
a  lineup  and  to  speak  for  identification.  Similarly,  the
displaying of a defendant’s limp would not be covered by the
privilege because it is a legitimate part of a proper courtroom
identification process.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  as  described  in  the  explanation  of
Choice (C), the privilege against self-incrimination would not
apply to these facts.

(B) is wrong because no search or seizure has been conducted
under circumstances where the defendant is being asked to do
something  as  part  of  a  proper  courtroom  identification
process.

(D)  is  wrong  because  every  person  has  a  legitimate
expectation  of  privacy,  regardless  of  one’s  status  as  a
criminal defendant. In addition, this situation is not one where
legitimate
there  has  been  an 
expectation  of  privacy — Devlin  is  not  in  a  place  where  he
has the reasonable expectation of privacy (the courtroom), nor
is his affliction a private matter (since it is readily apparent
when he walks).

CHAPTER 5
FORMAL PROCEEDINGS

I.    GRAND JURY PROCEEDINGS

A.  Self-incrimination and immunity

Question  14:  A  state  grand  jury  investigating  a  murder
learned  that  the  key  suspect  might  have  kept  a  diary.  The
grand  jury  issued  a  subpoena  duces  tecum  requiring  the
suspect  to  produce  any  diary.  The  subpoena  made  clear  that
the  grand  jury  was  seeking  only  the  diary  and  not  any
testimony  from  the  suspect.  The  suspect  refused  to  produce
the diary, citing the privilege against self-incrimination.

Under what circumstances, if any, could the grand jury compel
production  of  the  diary  over  the  suspect’s  Fifth  Amendment
privilege?
(A)  It  may  compel  production  without  granting  immunity
because the suspect was not compelled to write a diary.

(B)  It  may  compel  production  only  if  the  suspect  is  granted
use and derivative use immunity from the act of production.

(C)  It  may  compel  production  only  if  the  suspect  is  granted
transactional immunity.

(D) It may not compel production of a private diary under any
circumstances.

Answer 14: Choice (B) is correct. The confusing thing about
this  question  is  that  at  first  glance,  the  Fifth  Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination doesn’t seem to play any
role at all. What the privilege protects against is government’s
compelling  a  person  to  make  a  testimonial  communication,
and it’s hard to see what testimonial communication is being
compelled  here.  After  all,  the  government  didn’t  compel  the
suspect to keep a diary (if he indeed kept one). But the Fifth
Amendment  has  also  been  held  to  protect  against  orders
compelling  a  person  to  produce  (i.e.,  deliver  to  the
government)  a  document  or  other  thing,  if  the  act  of
production  would  have  testimonial  significance  by,  say,
the
authenticating 

the  document  or 

thing.  So  here, 

427

government, by issuing the subpoena, is in effect saying to the
suspect,  “If  you  have  kept  a  diary,  give  us  that  diary,  and
we’ll  know  from  the  fact  that  you  gave  it  to  us  that  you  are
conceding  that  it  is  indeed  something  you  wrote.”  So  the
suspect’s  mere  act  of  complying  with  the  subpoena  would
amount to implied testimony that the diary was written by him.

the 

two  sorts  of 

the  diary.  Of 

Because  of  the  above  analysis,  the  government  may  compel
production only if it gives the suspect some sort of immunity
against  the  testimonial  consequences  of  being  required  to
produce 
immunity — 
transactional  and  use — mere  use  immunity,  the  narrower  of
the  two,  suffices  for  Fifth  Amendment  purposes.  So  here,  as
this choice indicates, the government would have to give “use
and derivative use immunity from the act of production”; what
this means is that the diary would be admissible, but only as
long  as  the  government  had  some  other,  wholly-independent,
way  to  prove  to  the  jury  that  this  was  a  diary  kept  by  the
suspect. For instance, the prosecution might have a friend or
relative of the suspect testify that she saw the suspect keep a
diary  with  a  cover  that  matches  this  one,  and/or  that  the
witness  now  recognizes  the  handwriting  as  belonging  to  the
suspect — that  way,  the  government  would  not  be  relying  in
any  way  on  the  suspect’s  act  of  turning  over  this  particular
diary in order to show that the diary was kept by the suspect.
(A) is wrong because it ignores the problem that if the suspect
complies by producing his diary, this mere act of production
will itself tend to authenticate the diary, and thus be implicitly
testimonial. See Choice (B) for more about this problem.

(C)  is  wrong  because  use  immunity  is  enough  to  protect
against  violations  of  the  Fifth  Amendment.  It’s  true  that
transactional  immunity  (which  in  this  case  would  mean  that
the suspect would not be prosecuted for any crime described
in the diary) would also suffice to avoid the Fifth Amendment
problem.  But  that  sort  of  immunity  is  overkill — it’s  more
than  the  Constitution  requires.  As  is  further  explained  in
Choice (B), the less-broad “use immunity” would be enough.
Use  immunity  in  this  case  would  mean  that  the  government
must prove the diary’s authenticity (i.e., that it was written by
the suspect) by means wholly unconnected to the fact that the

428

suspect produced it in response to the subpoena.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  suspect’s  limited  privilege  against
self-incrimination  here  (the  privilege  not  to  have  his  act  of
producing  the  diary  in  response  to  the  subpoena  be  used  as
proof  of  the  diary’s  authenticity)  is  adequately  protected  by
either  use  immunity  or  transactional  immunity.  See  the
analysis in Choice (B) for more about this. So the government
can compel the production of this private diary.

B.  Attorney’s presence in grand jury room

Question  15:  A  federal  grand  jury  was  investigating  drug
trafficking  in  the  jurisdiction.  It  subpoenaed  a  witness  to
testify,  and  the  prosecutor  advised  the  witness  that  he  had  a
Fifth  Amendment  privilege  not  to  testify  if  he  so  chose.  The
witness  asked  that  his  counsel  be  allowed  to  advise  him
inside  the  grand  jury  room,  but  the  prosecutor  refused  to
allow the attorney inside. The witness, after speaking with his
attorney  outside  the  grand  jury  room,  decided  to  testify  and
ended up making self-incriminating statements.

The  witness  subsequently  was  indicted  for  drug  crimes.  The
indictment  was  based  on  the  witness’s  grand  jury  testimony
and  on  evidence  seized  in  an  unconstitutional  search  of  the
witness’s home.

The witness moved to dismiss the indictment.

Should the court dismiss the indictment?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  witness  was  denied  his  constitutional

right to advice of counsel.

(B)    Yes,  because  the  indictment  was  based  upon  illegally

seized evidence.

(C)  No, because the witness waived his constitutional rights

by testifying.

(D)  No, because the witness had no right to counsel inside the
grand jury room and the illegally seized evidence did not
affect the validity of the indictment.

Answer 15: Choice (D) is correct. First, a grand jury witness
does not have a constitutional right to counsel inside a grand
jury  room.  U.S.  v.  Mandujano  (1976).  Second,  the  Fourth
the
Amendment  exclusionary  rule  does  not  apply 

to 

429

presentation  of  evidence  before  a  federal  grand  jury.
Therefore, such a grand jury can properly issue an indictment
based  on  illegally-obtained  evidence.  U.S.  v.  Calandra
(1974).

(A)  is  wrong  because  a  grand  jury  witness  does  not  have  a
constitutional right to counsel inside a grand jury room. And
that is true even if the lawyer is “retained” rather than court-
appointed. U.S.  v.  Mandujano  (1976).  (By  the  way,  it’s  not
even clear that the prosecutor was constitutionally required to
let  the  witness  leave  the  grand  jury  room  to  consult  his
lawyer, as the prosecutor did here.)

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  Fourth  Amendment  exclusionary
rule  does  not  apply  to  the  presentation  of  evidence  before  a
federal  grand  jury.  See  the  discussion  of  this  issue  in  the
analysis of Choice (D).

(C) is wrong because although it reaches the right outcome, it
does  so  on  reasoning  that  is  less  good  than  the  reasoning  in
Choice (D). It’s certainly the case that the witness indeed had
a  Fifth  Amendment  right  to  decline  to  testify,  and  that  the
witness  waived  that  right  by  testifying  voluntarily  after
learning that he had the right. (His having consulted with his
lawyer  outside  the  jury  room  further  reinforces  the  idea  that
he voluntarily waived his right not to testify.) But this waiver
does  not  really  explain  why  the  court  will  refuse  to  dismiss
the  indictment.  That’s  because  the  indictment  was  based  not
only  on  the  testimony  but  also  on  the  evidence  from  the
unconstitutional  search,  and  even  unconstitutionally-obtained
evidence  can  be  considered  by  a  grand  jury  in  reaching  its
decision  to  indict.  (See  Choice  (D)  for  more  about  this.)  In
other words, even if the witness had not waived his right not
to  testify,  the  indictment  would  likely  have  been  issued
anyway,  and  properly  so.  Therefore,  any  waiver  by  the
witness is not the best explanation of why the court refused to
dismiss the indictment.

C.  Use of illegally obtained evidence

Question 16:  Suspecting  that  a  husband  had  slain  his  wife,
police  detectives  persuaded  one  of  the  husband’s  employees
to remove a drinking glass from the husband’s office so that it

430

could be used for fingerprint comparisons with a knife found
near  the  body.  The  fingerprints  matched.  The  prosecutor
announced that he would present comparisons and evidence to
the  grand  jury.  The  husband’s  lawyer  immediately  filed  a
motion 
fingerprint
comparisons  to  bar  its  consideration  by  the  grand  jury,
contending that the evidence was illegally acquired.

the  evidence  of 

to  suppress 

the 

The motion should be

(A)    granted,  because,  if  there  was  no  probable  cause,  the

grand jury should not consider the evidence.

(B)    granted,  because  the  employee  was  acting  as  a  police
agent and his seizure of the glass without a warrant was
unconstitutional.

(C)    denied,  because  motions  based  on  the  exclusionary  rule

are premature in grand jury proceedings.

(D)    denied,  because  the  glass  was  removed  from  the
husband’s  possession  by  a  private  citizen  and  not  a
police officer.

Answer 16: Choice (C) is correct. A grand jury may hear and
use  any  piece  of  evidence  regardless  of  its  admissibility,
including hearsay and illegally-obtained evidence. Therefore,
there are no grounds to seek the suppression of any particular
piece of evidence by a grand jury, and the filing of a motion to
suppress before the grand jury proceeding was premature.

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  law  and  does  not
address the relevant issue. During its deliberations, the grand
jury  may  review  all  evidence  available  to  it  to  determine
whether  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to  justify  a  trial.  In
particular,  the  fact  that  the  police’s  seizure  of  the  glass  may
have been illegal (which it would have been if the police had
not  had  probable  cause  and/or  had  not  gotten  a  search
warrant)  would  not  matter,  because  even  illegally-seized
evidence may be considered by the grand jury, as discussed in
Choice (C) above.
(B) is wrong because even if the seizure was unconstitutional,
the  grand  jury  was  entitled  to  consider  the  evidence.  By  the
way, on the underlying merits it probably is the case that: (1)
the employee was acting as a police agent (he was doing what

431

they  requested  him  to  do);  (2)  the  husband  probably  had  a
reasonable  expectation  of  privacy  in  the  glass  located  in  his
office (at least if it was his private office, rather than a part of
the  office  space  that  he  shared  with  employees);  and  (3)
whether  or  not  the  police  had  probable  cause  to  suspect  the
husband,  they  were  required  to  get  a  search  warrant  before
seizing an item as to which he had a reasonable expectation of
privacy.  But  none  of  this  matters  here,  because  even  if  the
seizure  was  a  violation  of  the  husband’s  Fourth  Amendment
rights, the grand jury was still entitled to consider the seized
item, as described in the discussion of Choice (C) above.

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  arrives  at  the  correct  result,  but  for
the wrong reason. The reason the motion should be denied is
because  it  was  filed  at  the  wrong  time.  Whether  or  not  the
employee was considered a private citizen when he obtained
the drinking glass will become relevant only when a motion is
properly made at a later point. (However, it is likely that in a
pre-trial suppression hearing, a court would conclude that the
employee was acting as a government agent, in which case the
evidence would be inadmissible at trial since it was obtained
without  a  search  warrant,  and  its  seizure  therefore  violated
the husband’s Fourth Amendment rights.)

II.   THE TRIAL

A.  Burden of proof in criminal cases

1.    General rules of allocation

a.   Elements

i.  Standard of proof

Question  17:  A  state  statute  provides  as  follows:  “In  all
criminal cases, whenever the Constitution permits, the burden
of proof as to a defense claimed by the defendant shall rest on
the  defendant,  and  the  magnitude  of  the  burden  shall  be  as
great as the Constitution permits.”
The same state defines the crime of forcible rape as follows:
“Forcible  rape  consists  of  sexual  penetration  inflicted  on  an
unconsenting  person  by  means  of  force  or  violence.  Consent
of the victim is a complete defense to a charge of rape.”

432

At  a  defendant’s  trial  for  forcible  rape,  he  testified  that  the
alleged  victim  had  consented  to  having  sexual  intercourse
with him.

How should the trial judge instruct the jury regarding the issue
of consent?

(A)  The  burden  of  proving  that  the  victim  consented,  by  a
preponderance of the evidence, rests on the defendant.

(B) The burden of proving that the victim consented, by clear
and convincing evidence, rests on the defendant.

(C) The burden of proving that the victim consented, by proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, rests on the defendant.

(D) The burden of proving that the victim did not consent, by
proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rests on the prosecution.

an 

Answer 17: Choice (D) is correct. The state statute includes
lack  of  consent  as  an  element  of  the  offense.  (We  know  that
because  the  statute  defines  forcible  rape  as  penetration
inflicted  on 
“unconsenting  person.”)  Therefore,
constitutional  due  process  requires  the  state  to  prove  that
element (and every element) of the crime beyond a reasonable
doubt.  Patterson  v.  New  York  (1977).  What  makes  this
question  mildly  confusing  is  that  the  statute  also  says
“Consent  of  the  victim  is  a  complete  defense  to  a  charge  of
rape” — this  might  lead  you  to  believe  that  the  victim’s
consent  is  an  affirmative  defense.  (The  defendant  may  be
constitutionally required to bear both the burden of production
and  the  burden  of  persuasion  with  respect  to  an  affirmative
defense.)  But  once  the  state  defined  lack  of  consent  as  an
element  of  the  crime,  as  it  did  here,  the  state  was  no  longer
free  to  classify  lack  of  consent  as  an  affirmative  defense,  if
the  consequence  of  that  classification  was  to  impose  on  the
defendant  either  the  burden  of  coming  forward  with  some
evidence  of  lack  of  consent,  or  the  burden  of  persuading  the
jury that the victim consented.
(A), (B), and (C) are all wrong because they are inconsistent
with  the  principle — correctly  expressed  in  (D) — that  the
prosecution  bears  the  burden  of  proving  lack  of  consent
because the crime is defined so as to make lack of consent an
element of the crime rather than an affirmative defense.

433

B.  Motion for directed verdict

1.   Standard

Question  18:  State  Y  employs  the  Model  Penal  Code  or
American Law Institute test for insanity, and requires the state
to  prove  sanity,  when  it  is  in  issue,  beyond  a  reasonable
doubt. At Askew’s trial for murder, he pleaded insanity. The
state put on an expert psychiatrist who had examined Askew.
He testified that, in his opinion, Askew was sane at the time
of  the  murder.  Askew’s  attorney  did  not  introduce  expert
testimony  on  the  question  of  sanity.  Rather,  he  presented  lay
witnesses  who  testified  that,  in  their  opinion,  Askew  was
insane at the time of the murder. At the end of the trial, each
side moves for a directed verdict on the question of sanity.

Which  of  the  following  correctly  describes  the  judge’s
situation?
(A)    She  may  grant  a  directed  verdict  for  the  defense  if  she
believes  that  the  jury  could  not  find  the  prosecution  to
have proved sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.

(B)  She may grant a directed verdict for the prosecution if she
believes that Askew’s witnesses on the insanity question
are not believable.

(C)    She  may  not  grant  a  directed  verdict  for  the  defense,
because  the  state  had  expert  testimony  and  the  defense
only lay witnesses.

(D)  She may grant a directed verdict for the prosecution if she
is  convinced  by  their  experts  that  Askew  was  sane
beyond a reasonable doubt.

Answer 18: Choice (A) is correct. When an insanity defense
is raised, if the case is tried before a jury, the jury will have
the  task  of  deciding  the  merits  of  the  defendant’s  insanity
defense,  just  as  it  will  decide  the  other  factual  issues  in  the
case.  Here,  where  the  state  must  prove  sanity  beyond  a
reasonable doubt, a verdict should be granted for the defense
if and only if the judge believes that a reasonable jury could
not  find  the  prosecution  to  have  proved  sanity  beyond  a
reasonable doubt.
(B)  is  wrong  because  the  judge’s  determination  of  the
credibility of the witnesses is not relevant. It is up to the jury

434

to determine the credibility of the witnesses and to decide the
factual issue of sanity. In fact, granting a directed verdict for
the  prosecution  on  any  element  of  the  case  would  deprive
defendant of his constitutional Sixth Amendment right to a jury
trial.

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  jury  need  not  weigh  an  expert
witness’s  testimony  more  heavily  than  that  of  a  lay  witness.
The  jury  is  always  free  to  disregard  or  disbelieve  any
witness’s evaluation of the defendant’s condition.

(D) is wrong because the determination is made by the jury. In
order to grant a directed verdict in favor of the prosecution, it
is not necessary that the judge be convinced that Askew was
sane,  only  that  a  jury  could  be  convinced  of  Askew’s  sanity
(beyond a reasonable doubt).

C.  D’s Confrontation Clause rights

1.  Confession implicating someone else, used during joint trial

Question  19:  Smith  and  Penn  were  charged  with  murder.
Each  gave  a  confession  to  the  police  that  implicated  both  of
them.  Smith  later  retracted  her  confession,  claiming  that  it
was coerced.

Smith  and  Penn  were  tried  together.  The  prosecutor  offered
both  confessions  into  evidence.  Smith  and  Penn  objected.
After  a  hearing,  the  trial  judge  found  that  both  confessions
were  voluntary  and  admitted  both  into  evidence.  Smith
testified at trial. She denied any involvement in the crime and
claimed  that  her  confession  was  false  and  the  result  of
coercion. Both defendants were convicted.

On appeal, Smith contends her conviction should be reversed
because of the admission into evidence of Penn’s confession.

Smith’s contention is
(A)  correct, unless Penn testified at trial.
(B)  correct, whether or not Penn testified at trial.
(C)  incorrect, because Smith testified in her own behalf.
(D)  incorrect, because Smith’s own confession was properly

admitted into evidence.

Answer  19:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  Sixth  Amendment

435

gives  any  criminal  defendant  “the  right  .  .  .  to  be  confronted
with  the  witnesses  against  him.”  The  Confrontation  Clause
has  two  main  components:  (1)  the  right  to  compulsory
process; and (2) the right to cross examine hostile witnesses.
The  Confrontation  Clause  prevents,  in  some  circumstances,
the  use  of  one  person’s  out-of-court  confession  against
another.  The  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  A’s  Confrontation
Clause  rights  are  violated  if  the  confession  of  B,  his  non-
testifying  co-defendant,  naming  A  as  a  co-participant  in  the
crime, is introduced at their joint trial. This is true even if the
jury  is  instructed  to  consider  the  confession  only  against  B,
not  A.  Bruton  v.  U.S.  (1968).  The  Bruton  principle  applies
where the defendant who allegedly confessed declines to take
the  stand.  If  the  confessor  takes  the  stand  and  denies  having
made the confession — and perhaps even if he takes the stand
and  acknowledges  the  confession,  but  then  opens  himself  up
to the other defendant’s cross-examination about it — there is
probably no Confrontation Clause problem. Therefore, if and
only if Penn testified at trial, Smith’s appeal would be denied
because his Confrontation Clause rights would not have been
denied.

(B)  is  wrong  because  whether  or  not  Smith’s  Confrontation
Clause rights were denied does depend upon whether or not
Penn testified. If Penn testified, then Smith’s rights would not
have been violated, as discussed in the explanation of Choice
(A).

(C)  is  wrong  because  whether  or  not  Smith  testified  is
irrelevant.  Smith’s  Confrontation  Clause  rights  give  him  the
right  to  cross  examine  hostile  witnesses.  Therefore,  it  is
relevant  whether  or  not  Penn  testifies,  as  he  is  a  hostile
witness that Smith has a right to cross examine.
(D)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  Smith’s  confession  was
properly  admitted  has  no  bearing  on  whether  his
Confrontation Clause rights have been violated by admission
of  a  co-defendant’s  confession.  He  is  afforded  the  right  to
cross  examine  hostile  witnesses,  a  right  which  has  been
denied to him in these circumstances.

III.  SENTENCING

436

A.  Sentencing generally

Question 20: During the course of a car chase in which two
police  officers  tried  to  apprehend  and  arrest  the  driver  and
passenger  for  bank  robbery,  one  of  the  officers  fired,  first  a
warning  shot  and  then  at  the  car.  He  struck  the  passenger
sitting next to the driver.

The driver was caught five minutes later. The passenger died
from loss of blood. The driver was charged with the murder
of  the  passenger.  The  jury  found  the  driver  guilty  of  the
murder  of  the  passenger.  Before  passing  sentence,  the  judge
heard argument by both parties. The prosecutor introduced the
criminal  record  of  the  driver,  showing  two  prior  felony
convictions.  Defense  counsel  admitted  the  correctness  of  the
record.  The  court  imposed  the  maximum  sentence  of  life
imprisonment. On appeal, the appellate court should hold that
this sentence

(A)    violated  the  driver’s  right  to  due  process,  in  that  it

deprived him of a fair and unbiased tribunal.

(B)    was  in  error  because  the  introduction  of  new  evidence

after the trial deprived the driver of a fair trial.

(C)  was not in error.
(D)    deprived  the  driver  of  the  right  to  confront  the  witness

against him.

Answer 20:  The  correct  choice  is  (C),  because  it  correctly
identifies  that  the  prior  convictions  can  be  introduced  at  the
sentencing hearing. In imposing sentences, the judge can rely
on a wide variety of evidence, including hearsay, reports that
are  not  cross-examined,  and  the  like.  (Somewhat  different
rules  apply  to  ‘‘unusual’’  sentencings — e.g.,  the  death
penalty — as  well  as  to  sentencing  guidelines  that  let  the
judge increase the maximum punishment based on the judge’s
factual findings. But neither of these factors is present here.)
Prior convictions are relevant to sentencing since they bear on
the  likelihood  of  a  defendant’s  rehabilitation.  Since  C
correctly  identifies  that  the  convictions  will  be  admissible,
it’s the best response.

(A)  is  wrong,  because  it  misstates  the  law:  The  driver  was
not deprived of a fair and unbiased tribunal. At a sentencing

437

hearing,  the  judge  is  entitled  to  take  into  account  prior
convictions,  as  a  means  of  determining  the  likelihood  of  the
defendant’s  rehabilitation,  among  other  things  (somewhat
different  rules  apply  to  ‘‘unusual’’  sentencings — e.g.,  the
death penalty).

(B)  is  wrong,  because  the  driver  was  not  deprived  of  a  fair
trial  by  the  delay  in  introducing  the  prior  convictions.  In  a
usual  sentencing  hearing,  the  judge  may  take  into  account  a
broad  spectrum  of  evidence,  including  hearsay,  non-cross-
examined reports, and prior convictions (somewhat different
rules  apply  to  ‘‘unusual’’  sentencings — e.g.,  the  death
penalty). If anything, introducing the prior convictions at trial
would have been fraught with pitfalls, since prior convictions
can be a very dangerous form of character evidence (the jury
is likely to grant them undue weight). As a result, introducing
the  prior  convictions  at  the  sentencing  hearing  for  the  first
time does not deprive the driver of a fair trial.

(D) is wrong, because it misstates the law. The driver was not
entitled  to  confront  witnesses  against  him  in  this  sentencing
hearing,  because  a  usual  sentence  was  imposed  (e.g.,  the
death  penalty  was  not  being  considered).  In  imposing  a
‘‘usual’’  sentence,  a  judge  can  rely  on  hearsay  evidence  as
well as reports that are not cross-examined. Williams v. N.Y.
(1949).

IV.  DOUBLE JEOPARDY

A.  Overlapping offenses

1.  Lesser included offense tried first

a.  Felony-murder scenario

Question  21:  Donald  was  arrested  in  Marilyn’s  apartment
after her neighbors had reported sounds of a struggle and the
police  had  arrived  to  find  Donald  bent  over  Marilyn’s
prostrate body. Marilyn was rushed to the hospital where she
lapsed into a coma. Despite the explanation that he was trying
to  revive  Marilyn  after  she  suddenly  collapsed,  Donald  was
charged  with  attempted  rape  and  assault  after  a  neighbor
informed the police that she had heard Marilyn sobbing, “No,

438

please no, let me alone.”

At  trial,  the  forensic  evidence  was  inconclusive.  The  jury
acquitted  Donald  of  attempted  rape  but  convicted  him  of
assault.  While  he  was  serving  his  sentence  for  assault,
Marilyn,  who  had  never  recovered  from  the  coma,  died.
Donald  was  then  indicted  and  tried  on  a  charge  of  felony
murder.  In  this  common-law  jurisdiction,  there  is  no  statute
that prevents a prosecutor from proceeding in this manner, but
Donald argued that a second trial for felony murder after his
original trial for attempted rape and assault would violate the
Double Jeopardy Clause.

His claim is

(A)  correct, because he was acquitted of the attempted rape

charge.

(B)  correct, because he was convicted of the assault charge.
(C)  incorrect, because Marilyn had not died at the time of the

first trial and he was not placed in jeopardy for murder.

(D)  incorrect, because he was convicted of the assault charge.
Answer 21: Choice (A) is correct. When a person is tried for
offense  A,  then  whether  he  is  convicted  or  acquitted,  the
Double  Jeopardy  Clause  prevents  him  from  being  later  tried
of  an  offense  B  of  which  offense  A  was  a  lesser-included
offense.  So  Donald  can  base  his  double  jeopardy  claim  on,
and  only  on,  an  offense  that  was  a  lesser-included-offense
within  the  felony-murder  charge.  Courts  and  legislatures
generally restrict application of the felony-murder doctrine to
certain dangerous felonies. The doctrine does apply to rape (a
crime of which Donald was acquitted), but generally does not
apply to assault (a crime of which Donald was convicted). So
the acquittal on the rape charge triggers double jeopardy, but
the conviction on the assault charge does not.
(B)  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  generally,  the  felony-murder
doctrine  does  not  apply  to  assault.  Therefore,  the  assault
charge  could  not  be  a  lesser-included-offense  within  the
felony-murder charge, making the assault charge irrelevant for
double jeopardy purposes.
(C) is wrong because it overlooks the fact that an acquittal on
lesser-included-offense  A  will  block  a  trial  for  greater-

439

offense-B.  Therefore,  even  though  Donald  couldn’t  have  yet
been  prosecuted  for  felony-murder  at  the  time  his  rape  trial
started  (because  Marilyn  was  still  alive),  the  rape  trial
invoked Donald’s double jeopardy rights. (If Donald had been
convicted  at  the  rape  trial,  the  fact  that  the  felony-murder
charge couldn’t have been tried yet would negate his double
jeopardy  claim;  but  given  that  the  rape  trial  led  to  his
acquittal, the fact that the felony- murder charge couldn’t have
been  tried  when  the  rape  trial  started  probably  won’t  negate
Donald’s use of double jeopardy.)

2.  Unable to try both charges at once

Question 22: On May 1, 2007, a car driven by the defendant
struck  a  pedestrian.  On  July  1,  2007,  with  regard  to  this
incident,  the  defendant  pleaded  guilty  to  reckless  driving  (a
misdemeanor) and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a fine
of $1,000. She served the sentence and paid the fine. On April
1,  2008,  the  pedestrian  died  as  a  result  of  the  injuries  she
suffered  in  the  accident.  On  March  1,  2011,  a  grand  jury
indicted  the  defendant  on  a  charge  of  manslaughter  of  the
pedestrian. On May 15, 2011, the trial had not begun and the
defendant  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  indictment  on  the
ground of double jeopardy, in that her conviction of reckless
driving arose out of the same incident, and on the ground that
the three-year statute of limitations for manslaughter had run.

The defendant’s motion should be

(A)  granted only on double jeopardy grounds.
(B)  granted only on statute of limitations grounds.
(C)    granted  on  either  double  jeopardy  grounds  or  statute  of

limitations grounds.
(D)  denied on both grounds.
Answer 22: Choice (D) is correct, because neither provides
a valid ground for dismissal.
The double jeopardy guarantee of the Fifth Amendment states
that a person cannot be tried twice for the same offense. The
guarantee  also  bars  the  government  from  trials  for  two
different  crimes  if  one  is  a  ‘‘lesser  included  offense’’  of  the
other.  However,  there  are  two  exceptions  to  the  lesser-
included-offense  doctrine.  One  of  those  exceptions  is  that  if

440

the  government  could  not  have  tried  the  second  crime  at  the
time  it  tried  the  first,  due  to  circumstances  beyond  the
government’s  control,  and  the  defendant  is  convicted  of  the
first crime the lesser-included-offense doctrine doesn’t apply.
That’s  what  happened  here:  By  the  time  of  the  original  trial
(or,  actually,  guilty  plea)  on  reckless  driving,  the  pedestrian
hadn’t yet died, so no manslaughter prosecution was possible.
Therefore, double jeopardy doesn’t apply.

Nor  does  the  statute  of  limitations  bar  the  manslaughter
prosecution. The statute of limitations doesn’t start to run until
all  facts  necessary  for  prosecution  have  occurred.  Here,  the
pedestrian’s death was one such fact, and it occurred less than
three years before the indictment, so the statute of limitations
hadn’t run by the date of indictment (which was the event that
satisfied the statute).

(A), (B), and (C) are wrong, since each of them asserts that at
least  one  of  the  two  grounds  was  valid,  and  neither  was  (as
shown in the discussion of choice D).

EVIDENCE

EVIDENCE Q&A BY TOPIC

All answers assume that the Federal Rules of Evidence (“FRE”) are in
force as to all issues. “ACN” refers to “Advisory Committee Notes” to a
particular Federal Rule of Evidence. “M&K” refers to Mueller &
Kirkpatrick, Evidence Hornbook (Aspen, 3d Ed., 2003).

CHAPTER 1
BASIC CONCEPTS

I.    CONDITIONS FOR ADMITTING EVIDENCE

A.  Relevant

1.  Definition

Question 1: In a prosecution for aggravated battery, a police

442

officer testified that when he arrested the defendant, he took a
knife  from  the  defendant  and  delivered  it  to  the  medical
examiner. The medical examiner testified that the knife blade
was consistent with the victim’s wound but admitted on cross-
examination that any number of other knives could also have
caused the wound.

Should  the  judge  grant  a  motion  to  strike  the  medical
examiner’s testimony?

(A)  No, because the probative worth of this evidence is for

the jury to assess.

(B)    Yes,  because  in  light  of  the  medical  examiner’s
admission,  his  testimony  has  insufficient  probative
value.

(C)    Yes,  because  the  medical  examiner  could  not  state  the
probability that the wound was caused by the defendant’s
knife.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  probative  value  is  substantially

outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

Answer  1:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  This  evidence  has  some
probative  value,  because  it  links  the  knife  in  defendant’s
possession  to  the  type  of  knife  that  could  have  caused  the
victim’s  wound.  The  evidence  is  not  very  strong,  because
other  knives  could  also  have  caused  the  wound.  But  how
much weight to give to the evidence is a decision for the jury.
FRE 401 requires only that evidence “(a) has any tendency to
make  a  fact  more  or  less  probable  than  it  would  be  without
the  evidence;  and  (b)  the  fact  is  of  consequence  in
determining  the  action.”  Thus  to  be  relevant,  evidence  need
only  have  some  probative  value  in  establishing  a  fact.  The
Advisory  Committee’s  Note  to  Rule  401  quotes  the  famous
statement  “A  brick  is  not  a  wall,”  making  the  point  that
evidence is admissible even if it is only a single brick that is
a part of a large wall of evidence establishing a party’s case.
the  relevancy
(B) 
requirement of FRE 401 if it “(a) has any tendency to make a
fact  more  or  less  probable  than  it  would  be  without  the
evidence;  and  (b)  the  fact  is  of  consequence  in  determining
the  action.”  The  medical  examiner’s  testimony  meets  this

is  wrong  because  evidence  meets 

443

minimal  standard  of  probativity.  And  it  is  probative  of  a
material fact — whether this knife was the crime weapon.

(C) is wrong because no statement of probability is required
for admissibility. The medical examiner’s testimony does not
have to establish that defendant’s knife caused the wound by
any particular standard of proof, such as beyond a reasonable
doubt,  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence,  or  by  a
preponderance of the evidence — it’s up to the jury to assess
the value of the evidence in determining guilt. The testimony
only  needs  to  have  some  unspecified-but-minimal  probative
value to be admissible.

That’s shown by FRE 401, under which evidence is deemed
to  have  probative  value,  and  to  be  admissible  (assuming  it
doesn’t violate some other specific prohibition), if it “(a) has
any  tendency  to  make  a  fact  more  or  less  probable  than  it
would  be  without  the  evidence;  and  (b)  the  fact  is  of
consequence in determining the action.”

(D)  is  wrong  because  it  mischaracterizes  the  evidence  here.
It’s true that FRE 403 requires a weighing of probative value
against  unfair  prejudice,  as  this  choice  suggests.  That  rule
establishes  what  might  be  described  as  a  presumption  of
admissibility:  Evidence  meeting  Rule  401’s  definition  of
relevance  is  admissible  unless  its  probative  value  is
“substantially outweighed” by the danger of unfair prejudice.
Here,  the  medical  examiner’s  testimony  does  not  appear  to
pose  any  significant  degree  of  unfair  prejudice,  let  alone
enough to “substantially outweigh” the probative value of that
testimony.

Question 2:  A  defendant’s  house  was  destroyed  by  fire  and
she was charged with arson. To prove that the defendant had a
motive  to  burn  down  her  house,  the  government  offered
evidence that the defendant had fully insured the house and its
contents.
Should the court admit this evidence?
(A)    No,  because  the  probative  value  of  the  evidence  of
insurance  upon  the  issue  of  whether  the  defendant
intentionally  burned  her  house  down  is  substantially
outweighed  by  the  dangers  of  unfair  prejudice  and

444

confusion of the jury.

(B)  No, because evidence of insurance is not admissible upon
the issue of whether the insured acted wrongfully.
(C)    Yes,  because  evidence  of  insurance  on  the  house  has  a
tendency to show that the defendant had a motive to burn
down the house.

(D)      Yes,  because  any  conduct  of  a  party  to  the  case  is

admissible when offered against the party.

Answer  2:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  This  is  a  relevance
problem.  The  main  issue  is  whether  the  evidence  meets  the
general  relevance  standard  of  FRE  401.  Under  that  rule,
evidence  is  relevant  as  long  as  it  “(a)  has  any  tendency  to
make  a  fact  more  or  less  probable  than  it  would  be  without
the  evidence;  and  (b)  the  fact  is  of  consequence  in
determining  the  action.”  Thus,  evidence  that  has  only  the
slightest  probative  value  can  be  admitted  under  this  rule.
While evidence that the property is insured is not conclusive
that the defendant committed arson (many people fully insure
their  houses),  it  is  relevant  to  the  issue  of  whether  the
defendant would have had a financial incentive or motive to
commit  the  arson — the  defendant  might  be  able  to  generate
cash more quickly by burning down the house and collecting
insurance proceeds than by attempting to sell the house. This
evidence meets the minimal probativity standard of FRE 401.

(There  is  a  special  rule  concerning  the  admissibility  of
evidence of insurance, but that rule doesn’t bar the evidence
here; see the discussion of Choice (B) for more about this.)

(A)  is  wrong  because  although  the  probative  value  of  this
evidence  on  the  issue  of  whether  defendant  intentionally
burned  her  house  down  is  not  particularly  strong,  it  is
somewhat  probative  of  the  issue  of  possible  motive,  so  it
meets  the  easy-to-satisfy  probativity  standard  of  FRE  401
(quoted  in  the  discussion  of  Choice  (C)  above).  FRE  403
provides that relevant evidence should be admitted unless its
probative value is “substantially outweighed” by the dangers
of  unfair  prejudice,  confusion,  or  waste  of  time.  Here,  the
evidence  of  insurance  is  probably  not  unfairly  prejudicial  at
all  (in  the  sense  that  it  does  not  have  an  undue  tendency  to
produce  decision  on  an  improper  basis  such  as  emotion);  in

445

any  event,  whatever  small  prejudicial  tendency  the  evidence
might have is certainly not enough to “substantially outweigh”
the probative value of the evidence.

(B)  is  wrong  because,  although  it  is  true  that  FRE  411  bars
evidence  of  insurance  to  establish  that  the  insured  acted
is
negligently  or  otherwise  wrongfully,  such  evidence 
admissible for other purposes, and proof of motive is such a
purpose. (In this respect, Rule 411 is similar to Rule 404(b),
under  which  evidence  of  past  conduct  cannot  be  admitted  to
prove  a  propensity  to  engage  in  such  conduct  but  can  be
admitted for other purposes, such as to prove motive.)

(D)  is  wrong  because  there  is  no  such  broad  rule  that  any
conduct of a party may be admitted against that party.

Question 3:  The  bus  in  which  a  passenger  was  riding  was
struck from the rear by a taxi. He sued the taxi company for a
claimed  neck  injury.  The  taxi  company  claimed  the  impact
was  too  slight  to  have  caused  the  claimed  injury  and
introduced testimony that all passengers had refused medical
attention  at  the  time  of  the  accident.  The  passenger  called  a
doctor  from  a  local  hospital  to  testify  that  three  persons
(otherwise proved to have been on the bus) were admitted to
the hospital for treatment of severe neck pain within a week
after  the  accident.  The  trial  judge  should  rule  the  doctor’s
testimony

(A)  admissible, because a doctor is properly qualified as an

expert in medical matters.

(B)    admissible  if  other  testimony  established  a  causal
connection  between  the  other  passengers’  pain  and  the
accident.

(C)    inadmissible,  because  the  testimony  to  neck  pain  is

hearsay, not within any exception.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  the  testimony  is  not  the  best
the

the  other  passengers’  pain  and 

evidence  of 
passengers are not shown to be unavailable.

Answer  3:  Choice  (B)  is  correct,  because  it  correctly
identifies  that,  if  a  causal  connection  is  provided,  the  other
instances  will  be  admissible.  The  passenger  is  offering
evidence of other injuries from the bus accident to prove that

446

his  own  injuries  were  caused  by  the  accident.  The  problem
posed  by  such  evidence  is  its  relevance.  In  order  for  such
evidence to be admissible, the material circumstances must be
substantially  identical,  and  the  proponent  of  the  evidence
(here, the passenger) must establish the similarity.

In this question, you’re told that it’s already been proven that
the  other  three  passengers  were  involved  in  the  same
accident. Thus, the only “missing link” that the passenger must
prove is that their injuries came from the same accident, since
this  will  provide  the  “substantial  similarity”  that  relevance
requires.  Choice  B  recognizes  and  resolves  this  issue,  by
the  other
focusing  on 
passengers’ injuries and the accident.

the  causal  connection  between 

(A)  is  wrong,  because  the  doctor’s  expert  status  is  not
relevant  to  the  issue  of  admissibility  here.  The  passenger  is
offering  evidence  of  other  injuries  from  the  bus  accident  to
prove that his own injuries were caused by the accident. The
problem posed by such evidence is its relevance; in order for
such  evidence  to  be  admissible,  the  material  circumstances
must  be  “substantially  similar,”  and  the  proponent  of  the
evidence  (here,  the  passenger)  must  establish  the  similarity.
The only “missing link” that the passenger must prove is that
their  injuries  came  from  the  same  accident,  since  this  will
provide the “substantial similarity” that relevance requires.

The  doctor’s  expertise  matters  only  if  he  is  going  to  give
expert  testimony  about  medical  matters.  So  if  the  doctor’s
testimony  proposed  to  address,  say,  the  similarity  of  the
injuries between the passenger and the other three passengers,
the  doctor’s  expert  status  would  be  relevant.  But  that’s  not
what’s  been  asked  of  him  here:  Instead,  all  the  doctor  has
been  asked  is  whether  three  other  passengers  from  the  same
bus  accident  were  admitted  to  the  hospital  that  week  for
treatment  of  severe  neck  pain,  a  question  that  would  not
require expert testimony.
(C)  is  wrong,  because  the  testimony  here  does  not  involve
hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove
the  truth  of  its  assertion.  Here,  there’s  no  out-of-court
statement; the doctor is being asked whether or not three other
bus passengers were admitted to the hospital for treatment of

447

neck pain within a week of the accident. This doesn’t involve
recounting any out-of-court statement, and one quick way for
you to identify this is that there’s no out-of-court declarant.

(D) is wrong, because it misapplies the “best evidence” rule.
The  Best  Evidence  Rule  applies  only  when  the  terms  of  a
writing  (or  recording  or  photograph)  are  being  proven.  FRE
1002.  It  doesn’t  require  that  the  “best  evidence”  for  every
issue  be  offered.  Since  no  writing  (or  recording  or
photograph) is involved here, there’s no “best evidence” rule
issue.

2.  Exclusion

Question 4: Deeb was charged with stealing furs from a van.
At trial, Wallace testified she saw Deeb take the furs.

The jurisdiction in which Deeb is being tried does not allow
in  evidence  lie  detector  results.  On  cross-examination  by
Deeb’s attorney, Wallace was asked, “The light was too dim
to identify Deeb, wasn’t it?” She responded. “I’m sure enough
that it was Deeb that I passed a lie detector test administered
by  the  police.”  Deeb’s  attorney  immediately  objects  and
moves to strike.

The trial court should

(A)  grant the motion, because the question was leading.
(B)    grant  the  motion,  because  the  probative  value  of  the
unresponsive  testimony  is  substantially  outweighed  by
the danger of unfair prejudice.

(C)  deny the motion, because it is proper rehabilitation of an

impeached witness.

(D)    deny  the  motion,  because  Deeb’s  attorney  “opened  the

door” by asking the question.

Answer 4:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  FRE  403  provides:  “The
court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is
substantially  outweighed  by  a  danger  of  one  or  more  of  the
following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading
the  jury,  undue  delay,  wasting  time,  or  needlessly  presenting
cumulative  evidence.”  The  fact  pattern  tells  us  that  the
lie  detector  results,
jurisdiction  excludes  evidence  of 
indicating that the jurisdiction questions the reliability of the

448

test  and  considers  evidence  of  the  test  results  to  be  of  low
probative  value.  “Unfair”  prejudice  means  “an  undue
tendency  to  suggest  decision  on  an  improper  basis  .  .  .  .”
Advisory  Committee  Note  to  FRE  403.  It  is  reasonable  to
assume that some members of a jury may regard the results of
a lie detector test as more scientific than they actually are, and
consequently give the test too much weight. Therefore, in this
jurisdiction, 
the  danger  of  unfair  prejudice  would
substantially  outweigh  the  (low)  probative  value  of  the  lie
detector test.

(A) is wrong because, although the motion would be granted,
it  would  not  be  for  the  stated  reason.  Leading  questions  are
generally permissible on cross examination. FRE 611(c).

that 

testimony 

(C) is wrong because, even apart from the FRE 403 problem
discussed in Choice (B), the reasoning supporting this answer
mischaracterizes  the  concept  of  “rehabilitation.”  Once  a
witness  has  been  impeached,  rehabilitation  is  brought  out
is  offered  by  counsel
through  separate 
representing  the  party  who  is  a  proponent  of  the  impeached
witness’s  testimony.  It  is  incorrect  to  characterize  the
witness’s  own  response  to  opposing  counsel’s  “impeaching”
question as “rehabilitation” of that witness’s credibility.
(D) is wrong because (1) the motion would be granted for the
reason  discussed  in  Choice  (B);  and  (2)  the  reasoning
supporting this answer misapplies the concept of “opening the
door.”  A  topic  which  is  otherwise  off-limits  to  an  opposing
party is considered “opened for questioning” once it has been
introduced  by  the  other  party — the  rationale  is  that  if  the
topic  has  been  “opened”  by  one  party  it  would  be  unfair  to
prohibit  the  opposing  party  from  addressing  it.  In  this  case,
the question “The light was too dim to identify Deeb, wasn’t
it?”  is  not  even  arguably  related  to  the  topic  of  Wallace’s
passing  a  lie  detector  test,  so  there  is  no  unfairness  in  not
allowing Wallace to talk about the lie detector test.

Question 5: A defendant is tried on a charge of driving while
intoxicated.  When  the  defendant  was  booked  at  the  police
station,  a  videotape  was  made  that  showed  him  unsteady,
abusive,  and  speaking  in  a  slurred  manner.  If  the  prosecutor
lays  a  foundation  properly  identifying  the  tape,  should  the

449

court  admit  it  in  evidence  and  permit  it  to  be  shown  to  the
jury?

(A)  Yes, because it is an admission.
(B)  Yes, because its value is not substantially outweighed by

unfair prejudice.

(C)    No,  because  the  privilege  against  self-incrimination  is

applicable.

(D)    No,  because  specific  instances  of  conduct  cannot  be

proved by extrinsic evidence.

Answer  5:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  To  answer  this  question,
you  have  to  deal  with  two  issues:  (1)  is  the  evidence
relevant?;  and  (2)  if  the  answer  to  (1)  is  “yes,”  does  any
principle prevent the admission of the evidence?

With respect to (1), FRE 401 says that “Evidence is relevant
if:  (a)  it  has  any  tendency  to  make  a  fact  more  or  less
probable than it would be without the evidence; and  (b) the
fact is of consequence in determining the action.” Whether the
defendant  was  intoxicated  is  certainly  a  “fact  .  .  .  of
consequence  in  determining  the  action,”  so  part  (b)  of  the
relevance  test  is  easily  satisfied.  And  the  fact  that  the
videotape shows the defendant being “unsteady, abusive, and
speaking  in  a  slurred  manner”  clearly  makes  it  more  likely
that the defendant was intoxicated than if the videotape were
not  presented,  so  part  (a)  is  satisfied,  making  the  evidence
relevant.

With respect to (2), there must not be any principle that makes
this piece of evidence inadmissible despite its relevance. The
only  plausible  candidate  for  such  a  principle  is  FRE  403,
which says that “The court may exclude relevant evidence if
its probative value is substantially outweighed  by  a  danger
of  one  or  more  of  the  following:  unfair  prejudice,  confusing
the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or
needlessly  presenting  cumulative  evidence.”  Since  Choice
(B)  refers  to  the  balance  between  probative  value  and
negative consequences like unfair prejudice, FRE 403 has to
be analyzed. The defendant’s best argument would be that the
in  “unfair  prejudice”  substantially
tape  would 
outweighing  the  tape’s  probative  value.  But  the  court  would

result 

450

almost  certainly  conclude  that  any  such  prejudice  would  not
be  “unfair” — the  tape  accurately  depicts  the  defendant’s
state, and there is nothing unfair about the depiction.

(A)  is  wrong,  because  it  does  not  correctly  characterize  the
facts. This choice suggests that the defendant’s acts would be
considered  hearsay,  but  would  be  admissible  nonetheless
under the “admissions” hearsay exclusion. Hearsay is an out-
of-court  statement  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  its  assertion.
The  problem  here  is  that  the  videotape  does  not  contain  any
assertion the truth of which is being proven by the videotape.
While conduct can be considered an admission if, from it, one
can  reasonably  infer  that  the  actor  is  conscious  of  his  guilt,
this  is  not  the  case  here;  the  defendant’s  conduct  is  non-
assertive (i.e., not intended to communicate).

(C) is wrong, because the privilege against self-incrimination
would  not  apply  to  these  facts.  The  privilege  against  self-
incrimination  is  a  testimonial  privilege;  it  only  allows  a
person  the  right  not  to  be  compelled  to  testify  as  to  matters
that might tend to incriminate him. Here, there’s no testimony
involved — the  evidence  being  offered  is  an  out-of-court
videotape  of 
is  not
“testifying”  in  the  video  (nor  has  he  apparently  been
“compelled” to do anything). As a result, the videotape is not
covered by the privilege.

the  defendant,  but 

the  defendant 

(D) is wrong, because it both misstates the facts and misstates
the  law.  This  choice  states  an  ostensible  rule  of  law,  but
refers to two ideas, neither of which applies here.

The  “specific  instances  of  conduct”  part  suggests  that
character  evidence  is  involved  here — the  examiners  are
trying  to  make  you  think  of  the  rule  (FRE  405(a))  that
prohibits proving someone’s character trait by specific prior
instances  of  that  character  trait,  to  show  that  he  probably
acted  in  conformity  with  that  trait  on  the  present  occasion.
However,  the  evidence  here  suggests  that  the  defendant  was
drunk on this occasion, not another one, so it’s not character
evidence  of  the  sort  that’s  covered  by  the  no-specific-
instances rule.
The “extrinsic evidence” part is designed to make you think of

451

the  rule  that  even  in  those  situations  where  someone’s
character  trait  can  be  proven  by  specific  instances  of  prior
conduct,  that  proof  must  come  in  the  form  of  cross-
examination of an already-testifying witness, not by means of
a new witness or a new piece of documentary evidence. (This
is  a  common-law  rule,  carried  forward  by  negative
implication  in  FRE  405(a).)  But  since  no  character-trait
evidence is being offered here (see the prior paragraph), the
reference to extrinsic evidence is irrelevant.

B.  Offering testimonial evidence

1.  Testimony by trial judge

Question  6:  A  defendant  was  charged  with  murder.  While
walking down the hallway during a recess in the defendant’s
trial,  the  judge  overheard  the  defendant  say  to  his  attorney,
“So  what  if  I  did  it?  There’s  not  enough  proof  to  convict.”
Upon  the  judge’s  reporting  the  incident  to  counsel,  the
prosecutor called the judge as a witness in the trial.

Is  the  judge’s  testimony  regarding  the  defendant’s  statement
admissible?

(A)  Yes, as the statement of a party-opponent.
(B) 

  Yes,  because 
the  defendant’s  statement,  although
otherwise  privileged,  was  made  without  reasonable
efforts to preserve confidentiality.

(C)    No,  because  the  statement  was  a  privileged  attorney-

client communication.

(D)    No,  because  a  judge  may  never  testify  in  a  trial  over

which he or she is presiding.

Answer 6: Choice (D) is correct. Although the judge is being
asked  to  recount  an  out-of-court  statement  made  by  a  party
that  is  offered  against  that  party,  admissibility  here  does  not
turn on the hearsay rule. Regardless of whether the evidence
is admissible under the hearsay rule, FRE 605 provides that
“The presiding judge may not testify as a witness at the trial.”
Thus,  the  judge  cannot  offer  any  testimony  of  any  kind,  no
matter how probative and important his testimony.
(A)  is  wrong  because  even  though  the  statement  is  the
admission  of  a  party-opponent  and  would  be  otherwise

452

admissible  non-hearsay  under  FRE  801(d)(2)(A),  FRE  605
says that the presiding judge cannot be called as a witness to
testify about anything.

that 

confidentiality, 

this  means  only 

(B)  is  wrong  because,  although  it  is  true  that  reasonable
efforts  were  not  made  by  the  defendant  and  his  attorney  to
the
preserve 
communication  was  not  privileged — it  does  not  mean  the
statement is necessarily admissible. The problem here is that
under  FRE  605,  the  statement  cannot  be  proven  through  the
testimony  of  the  presiding  judge  because  that  rule  bars  the
presiding judge from offering any testimony of any kind. The
defendant’s  lack  of  efforts  to  preserve  confidentiality  mean
that  the  statement  probably  would  be  admissible  if  someone
other than the presiding judge had heard it and been asked to
testify about it.

(C) is wrong because, although it reaches the right outcome, it
uses  incorrect  reasoning.  The  statement  would  not  be
privileged. That’s because reasonable efforts were not made
by the defendant and his attorney to preserve confidentiality,
since the statement was made in a hallway open to the public
in a voice loud enough to be overheard.

C.  Making and responding to objections

1.  Hearing outside of presence of jury

Question  7:  A  defendant  was  on  trial  for  burglary.  The
prosecutor  called  the  arresting  officer  to  testify  that  shortly
after the arrest the defendant had orally admitted her guilt to
him.  Before  the  officer  testified,  the  defendant  objected  that
no  Miranda  warning  had  been  given,  and  she  requested  a
hearing  outside  the  presence  of  the  jury  to  hear  evidence  on
that issue.
How should the court proceed?

(A)  The court should grant the request, because the hearing on
the  admissibility  of  the  confession  must  be  conducted
outside the presence of the jury.

(B)  The court may grant or deny the request, because the court
has  discretion  whether  to  conduct  preliminary  hearings
in the presence of the jury.

453

(C)  The court should deny the request and rule the confession
inadmissible,  because  only  signed  confessions  are
permitted in criminal cases.

(D)   The court should deny the request and rule the confession
admissible,  because  it  is  the  statement  of  a  party-
opponent.

Answer  7:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  admissibility  of  the
officer’s  testimony  turns  on  two  issues:  (1)  whether  a
Miranda warning had to be given to the defendant before her
confession  can  be  admitted;  and  (2)  whether  the  judge’s
determination of the first issue must be preceded by a hearing
conducted in front of or outside the hearing of the jury. With
respect to the first question, Miranda warnings must be given
before  a  confession  made  by  a  person  under  arrest  can  be
admitted.  Since  the  defendant  contends  that  no  Miranda
warnings were given, she is entitled to a hearing on the issue.
The  rule  resolving  the  second  question  is  contained  in  FRE
104(c),  which  says  that  a  “hearing  [that  involves]  the
admissibility of a confession” must be conducted “so that the
jury cannot hear it.” (Note that this provision goes on to say
that  hearings  on  all  other  preliminary  matters  shall  be
conducted  outside  the  presence  of  the  jury  only  when  either
justice requires or when a criminal defendant is a witness and
requests a hearing outside of the jury’s presence.) Thus under
FRE  104(c),  the  hearing  must  be  conducted  outside  the
presence of the jury.

(B)  is  wrong  because  FRE  104(c)  mandates  that  the
admissibility  of  confessions  “must”  be  conducted  out  of  the
hearing of the jury. So the trial court has no discretion in this
matter.

(C)  is  wrong  because  oral  confessions,  like  signed  written
confessions,  are  admissible  in  criminal  cases,  assuming  that
any required Miranda warnings were given.
(D)  is  wrong  because  it  ignores  the  effect  of  Miranda.  It’s
true  that  a  confession  of  a  criminal  defendant  is  an  out-of-
court  statement  made  by  a  party-opponent,  which  makes  it
non-hearsay under FRE 801(d)(2)(A) and thus admissible — 
as a matter of evidence law — to prove the truth of the matter
asserted  within  that  statement.  But  the  rules  of  evidence

454

cannot  alter  the  constitutional  requirement  that  Miranda
warnings must be given before a confession made by a person
under arrest is admissible.

455

CHAPTER 2
CIRCUMSTANTIAL PROOF: SPECIAL
PROBLEMS

I.    CHARACTER EVIDENCE

A.  Character is essential element of case

1.  Other aspects of other-crimes evidence

a.  Rule 403 balancing

Question 8: Decker, charged with armed robbery of a store,
denied that he was the person who had robbed the store.

In  presenting  the  state’s  ease,  the  prosecutor  seeks  to
introduce  evidence  that  Decker  had  robbed  two  other  stores
in the past year.
This evidence is
(A)    admissible,  to  prove  a  pertinent  trait  of  Decker’s

character and Decker’s action in conformity therewith.

(B)  admissible, to prove Decker’s intent and identity.
(C)    inadmissible,  because  character  must  be  proved  by
reputation or opinion and may not be proved by specific
acts.

(D)  inadmissible, because its probative value is substantially

outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

Answer  8:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Although  evidence  of
Decker’s previous two robberies may arguably be relevant as
to  whether  Decker  robbed  the  store  in  the  present  case,  its
probative value is low and dwarfed by the prejudicial value
of the evidence. FRE 403 says that relevant evidence may be
excluded  “if  its  probative  value  is  substantially  outweighed
by  the  danger  of  one  or  more  of  the  following:  unfair
prejudice[.]” “Unfair” prejudice means “an undue tendency to
suggest  decision  on  an  improper  basis  .  .  .  .  ”  Advisory
Committee Note (ACN) to FRE 403. The probative value of
the evidence is pretty low, since the other acts don’t bear very
strongly on whether Decker is the robber in the present case

456

(there’s  no  indication  that  the  m.o.’s  are  all  that  similar,  for
instance — see  Choice  (B)  below).  Conversely,  there’s  a
large risk that if the evidence were admitted, some members
of  the  jury  would  likely  regard  it  as  more  probative  than  it
actually  is,  and  consequently  give  the  evidence  too  much
weight.

(A) is wrong because the general rule is that “Evidence of a
person’s  character  or  character  trait  is  not  admissible  to
prove  that  on  a  particular  occasion  the  person  acted  in
accordance with the character or trait.” FRE 404(a)(1). There
are  some  exceptions,  but  none  applies  here.  This  choice
asserts  a  rule — admissibility  of  character-trait  evidence  to
prove  action  in  conformity  with  the  trait  on  the  present
occasion — that  is  the  exact  opposite  of  the  real  rule  of
404(a).

(B)  is  wrong  for  two  reasons.  First,  the  previous  robberies
are probably not sufficiently probative of Decker’s identity or
his intent (the latter isn’t even an issue in this case). It’s true
that  evidence  of  other  acts  may  be  admissible  for  purposes
other  than  to  show  action  in  conformity  with  a  person’s
character,  and  that  two  of  these  acceptable  purposes  are  to
prove identity and intent. FRE 404(b)(2). But generally, when
other  acts  are  offered  to  prove  identity,  the  prosecution’s
theory  is  that  the  other  acts  by  the  accused  are  so  similar  in
method to the crime charged that all bear his “signature” (thus
justifying  the  inference  that  if  the  defendant  committed  the
prior  acts,  he  also  must  have  committed  the  present  one).
Here,  the  other  robberies  aren’t  similar  enough  to  meet  this
“signature” standard.

Secondly,  this  evidence  poses  an  extremely  high  risk  of
prejudice, far outweighing its limited probative value, and is
thus excludible under FRE 403 (see the discussion of Choice
(D) above).
(C) is wrong because (1) it at least slightly misstates the law;
and  (2)  more  importantly,  it  gives  an  explanation  that  is
inapplicable here. While it’s true that, in general, character or
a  trait  of  character  must  be  proved  by  reputation  or  opinion
evidence, not specific-acts evidence (FRE 405(a)), there are
some scenarios in which specific-acts evidence is admissible

457

(e.g.,  where  a  character  trait  is  an  “essential  element  of  a
charge, claim or defense” — see FRE 405(b)). But the bigger
problem  is  that  what  the  prosecution  is  offering  here  is  not,
strictly speaking, character evidence — the prosecution is not
offering the evidence to show that Decker has a character or
tendency  to  commit  robbery;  rather,  it’s  trying  to  qualify  for
one or more of the “other purposes than character” exceptions
mentioned by 404(b), e.g., identity.

II.   METHODS OF PROVING CHARACTER:
REPUTATION, OPINION, AND PROOF OF
SPECIFIC ACTS

A.  FRE

1.  D’s good-character evidence

a.  Rebuttal

Question 9: The defendant, who was charged with the crime
of assaulting a victim, admitted striking the victim. However,
the defendant claimed to have acted in self-defense when he
was  attacked  by  the  victim,  who  was  drunk  and  belligerent.
The  defendant  offered  testimony  of  his  employer,  who
proposes  to  testify  that  he  has  known  and  employed  the
defendant  for  10  years  and  knows  the  defendant’s  reputation
among the people with whom he lives and works to be that of
a peaceful, law-abiding, nonviolent person.

The trial judge should rule this testimony

(A) 

  admissible,  because  it  is  relevant  to  show  the
improbability  of  the  defendant’s  having  committed  an
unprovoked assault.

(B)    admissible,  because  it  is  relevant  to  a  determination  of
the extent of punishment if the defendant is convicted.
(C)    not  admissible,  because  whether  the  defendant  is
normally a person of good character is irrelevant to the
specific charge.

(D)  not admissible, because it is irrelevant without a showing
that  the  defendant’s  employer  was  one  of  the  persons
among whom the defendant lived and worked.

458

Answer  9:  The  best  choice  is  (A),  because  it  correctly
applies  the  “Mercy  Rule”  to  these  facts.  The  problem  under
these facts is that the evidence offered is character evidence,
which  is,  as  a  very  general  rule,  inadmissible.  However,
choice  A  correctly  identifies  that  the  “Mercy  Rule”  will
operate to make this evidence admissible. Under the “Mercy
Rule,”  in  criminal  cases  only,  the  defendant  may  offer
evidence (presumably favorable) of his own character in the
form  of  reputation  or  opinion,  if  the  evidence  is  pertinent  to
an issue in the case. See FRE 404(a): “Evidence of a person’s
character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on
a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the
character or trait . . . [except that (2)] . . . in a criminal case:
(A)  a  defendant  may  offer  evidence  of  the  defendant’s
pertinent trait[.]”  The  character  evidence  here  is  in  the  form
of reputation, and, by tending to prove that the defendant is a
non-violent, peace-loving person, it is pertinent to an issue in
the case (whether the defendant is likely to have committed an
unprovoked assault).

the  evidence 

is  wrong,  because 

(B) 
is  substantively
admissible  on  the  issue  of  the  defendant’s  guilt  (see  the
discussion  of  Choice  (A)  above),  not  merely  on  the  issue  of
punishment.  In  fact,  evidence  offered  solely  for  purposes  of
sentencing  would  not  generally  not  be  admissible  during  the
guilt  phase  of  the  trial.  But  once  the  defendant  was  found
guilty, in the sentencing phase, the judge can rely on evidence
that  would  be  inadmissible  at  trial  (e.g.,  hearsay  not  within
any exception). Williams v. N.Y. (1949).

(C)  is  wrong,  because  it  doesn’t  recognize  that  the  “Mercy
Rule” will make the evidence admissible. As a general rule,
evidence of a person’s character, offered to prove he acted in
conformity  with  that  character  on  the  present  occasion,  is
inadmissible.  FRE  404(a)(1).  However,  under  the  “Mercy
Rule,”  in  criminal  cases  only,  the  defendant  may  offer
pertinent  evidence  of  his  own  character,  in  the  form  of
reputation or opinion. See the discussion of Choice (A) above
for more details.
(D)  is  wrong,  because  it  raises  a  threshold  issue  of
competency that is not at issue under these facts. Under FRE

459

the 

602  and  603,  a  witness  is  competent  to  testify  if  he  has
personal knowledge of the matter on which he will testify, and
he  declares  that  he  will  testify  truthfully,  by  oath  or
affirmation.  As  the  defendant’s  employer,  it  could  fairly  be
assumed  that  the  employer  is,  in  fact,  competent  to  testify
about 
peacefulness.
Furthermore,  since  reputation  testimony  by  definition  only
requires  that  the  witness  be  familiar  with  the  subject’s
reputation  (not,  for  instance,  familiar  with  specific  acts  by
the  defendant  demonstrating  the  character  trait  in  issue),  it
would  not  be  necessary  to  prove  that  the  witness  lived  or
worked with the defendant.

defendant’s 

reputation 

for 

Question 10:  The  defendant  was  charged  with  the  crime  of
assaulting  the  victim.  He  admitted  striking  the  victim,  but
claimed  to  have  acted  in  self-defense  when  he  was  attacked
by the victim, who was drunk and belligerent after a football
game.

The defendant offered testimony of defendant’s employer that
he  had  known  and  employed  the  defendant  for  twelve  years
and  knew  the  defendant’s  reputation  among  the  people  with
whom  he  lived  and  worked  to  be  that  of  a  peaceful,  law-
abiding,  nonviolent  person.  The  trial  judge  admitted  this
testimony.
On  cross-examination  of  the  employer,  the  state’s  attorney
asked  the  employer  if  he  had  heard  that  the  defendant  often
engaged in fights and brawls. The trial judge should rule the
question

(A)  admissible, because evidence of the defendant’s previous

fights and brawls may be used to prove his guilt.

(B)  admissible, because it tests the employer’s knowledge of

the defendant’s reputation.

(C)    inadmissible,  because  it  seeks  to  put  into  evidence

separate, unrelated offenses.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  no  specific  time  or  incidents  are

specified and inquired about.

Answer  10:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  question  will  be
admissible to impeach the employer as a reputation witness.
The  problem  here  is  that  the  evidence  the  prosecutor  is

460

seeking  is  character  evidence.  Choice  (B)  offers  a  way  to
overcome  this  problem.  Under  these  facts,  the  employer  is
testifying  as  a  reputation  witness  on  the  defendant’s  behalf;
that  is,  he’s  testifying  that  the  defendant  is  known  as  a
peaceful,  nonviolent  person.  This  evidence  is  admissible
under  FRE  404(1),  which  allows  an  accused  to  offer
evidence of his own “pertinent trait of character.” Then, FRE
405(a)  says  that  where  evidence  of  a  “person’s  character  or
character trait is admissible” (which the evidence here is, as
described in the prior sentence), “On cross-examination of the
character  witness,  the  court  may  allow  an  inquiry  into
relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct.” So once
the  employer  gave  the  testimony  favorable  to  the  defendant
about  the  defendant’s  peaceable  reputation,  the  prosecution
was entitled to make “inquiry into relevant specific instances
of  [the  defendant’s]  conduct.”  The  specific  instances  being
inquired  about  (frequent  engaging  in  fights  and  brawls)  are
“relevant,”  because  if  the  employer  didn’t  know  about  these
instances,  his  testimony  about  the  defendant’s  reputation  for
peaceability  would  be  of  questionable  accuracy.  (If  the
is  he  really

employer  didn’t  know 
knowledgeable  about  the  defendant’s  reputation  on  this
subject?)

true  facts, 

(A) is wrong because it is unduly broad. Since the defendant
offered  favorable  reputation  evidence  of  his  peaceability  as
he was permitted to do under 404(a)(1), the prosecution was
permitted to rebut that evidence. The rebuttal evidence was in
fact substantively admissible to prove that the defendant was
not  peaceable,  and  therefore  probably  wasn’t  acting  in  self-
defense.  However,  this  choice  suggests  that  independent
(extrinsic) evidence of the fights would have been admissible.
In fact, only questioning of the defendant’s character witness
(the  employer)  was  permissible,  on  account  of  FRE  405(a) 
— the prosecution couldn’t have introduced extrinsic proof of
the  defendant’s  previous  fights  (e.g.,  by  testimony  from  a
different witness who observed them), and his choice falsely
implies that such evidence could have been admitted.
(C) is wrong because it fails to identify that the evidence can
be  brought  out  on  the  cross  of  the  employer,  as  further

461

discussed in Choice (B).

(D)  is  wrong  because,  while  impeachment  of  a  reputation
witness  with  specific  instances  is  possible,  the  specific
instances need not be identified as precisely as (D) suggests.
Under  FRE  404(a),  a  reputation  witness  (of  which  the
employer is one) may be questioned about specific instances
bearing on the reputation, since not knowing such information
reflects  on  the  witness’s  competence  to  testify  as  to  the
person’s reputation in the community. However, the testimony
here  is  specific  enough  to  constitute  specific  acts;  it  clearly
does not amount to opinion or reputation testimony.

III.  LIABILITY INSURANCE

A.  General rule

1.  Other purposes

Question  11:  A  passenger  is  suing  a  defendant  for  injuries
suffered  in  the  crash  of  a  small  airplane,  alleging  that  the
defendant had owned the plane and negligently failed to have
it properly maintained. The defendant has asserted in defense
that  he  never  owned  the  plane  or  had  any  responsibility  to
maintain  it.  At  trial,  the  passenger  calls  a  witness  to  testify
that the witness had sold to the defendant a liability insurance
policy on the plane.

The testimony of the witness is

(A)  inadmissible, because the policy itself is required under

the original document rule.

(B)    inadmissible,  because  of  the  rule  against  proof  of

insurance where insurance is not itself at issue.

(C)    admissible  to  show  that  the  defendant  had  little
motivation  to  invest  money  in  maintenance  of  the
airplane.
  admissible  as  some  evidence  of  the  defendant’s
ownership of or responsibility for the airplane.

(D) 

Answer  11:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  FRE  (like  the
common law) provide that evidence that a person carried or
did not carry liability insurance is not admissible on the issue

462

of whether that person acted negligently. (See FRE 411, first
sentence.) This rule bars such evidence when it is offered by
a plaintiff to suggest that because the defendant was insured,
the defendant was probably careless. However, the rule does
not  apply  where  the  evidence  is  offered  for  some  other
purpose, “such as proving . . . agency, ownership, or control.”
(FRE  411,  second  sentence.)  That’s  what’s  happening  here 
— the  evidence  is  being  used  to  show  that  because  the
defendant  bought  a  liability  policy  on  the  plane,  he  had
ownership or control of it.

(A) is wrong because the terms of the policy are not at issue,
only  the  policy’s  existence.  It’s  true  that  FRE  1002,  entitled
“Requirement of the original” (and commonly called the Best
Evidence Rule) says that in proving the terms of a writing or a
recording, the original must normally be produced. Here, the
BER would apply if the terms of the insurance policy were in
question.  But  the  terms  are  not  in  question  here — the
witness’s testimony involves only the existence of the policy,
not its terms, so the BER does not apply.

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  rule  about  proof  of
insurance. The rule against proof of liability insurance is not a
general  rule  against  “proof  of  insurance  where  insurance  is
not itself the issue” (as this choice asserts). Instead, the rule,
embodied in FRE 411, prohibits proof of a liability policy’s
existence  when  offered  to  prove  negligence.  (But  as  the
discussion  of  Choice  (D)  explains,  Rule  411  does  not  apply
here, because the proof of the policy’s existence is not being
offered to prove negligence.)

(C) is wrong because it inaccurately asserts that the evidence
is  being  offered  to  suggest  the  defendant  was  probably
careless,  an  assertion  that,  if  true,  would  result  in  the
evidence’s being inadmissible. FRE 411, first sentence, says
that  “Evidence  that  a  person  was  or  was  not  insured  against
liability is not admissible to prove whether the person acted
negligently  or  otherwise  wrongfully.”  Since  this  choice
suggests  that  the  evidence  is  being  offered  to  show  that  an
insured  plane  owner  would  be  less  likely  to  properly
maintain  the  plane,  it’s  treating  the  evidence  as  a  method  of
asserting  the  defendant’s  negligence,  a  use  that  would  fly

463

squarely in the face of FRE 411.

IV.  SETTLEMENTS AND PLEA BARGAINS

A.  Settlements

Question 12: Carr, a driver, ran into and injured Pedersen, a
pedestrian. Pedersen has sued Carr, alleging that Carr, while
drunk, struck Pedersen who was in a duly marked crosswalk.
Pedersen’s  counsel  wishes  to  prove  that  after  the  accident
Carr went to Pedersen and offered $1,000 to settle Pedersen’s
claim.

The trial judge should rule this evidence

(A)  admissible as an admission of a party.
(B)    admissible  as  an  admission  to  show  Carr’s  liability,
provided the court gives a cautionary instruction that the
statement  should  not  be  considered  as  bearing  on  the
issue of damages.

(C)  inadmissible since it is not relevant either to the question

of liability or the question of damages.

(D)    inadmissible  because  even  though  it  is  relevant  and  an
admission,  the  policy  of  the  law  is  to  encourage
settlement negotiations.

Answer  12:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  This  choice  correctly
characterizes the statement as relevant and an admission, and
correctly  concludes  that  the  evidence  will  be  inadmissible
due to public policy considerations. What’s being proffered is
a settlement offer by Carr. But under FRE 408, admissions in
conjunction  with  settlement  negotiations  are  inadmissible  to
prove negligence, liability, or a claim’s value. That’s the case
here.
(A)  is  wrong  because  FRE  408  says  that  statements  in
conjunction  with  settlement  offers  are  inadmissible  to  prove
negligence,  liability,  or  a  claim’s  value.  So  even  though
Carr’s  statement  would  otherwise  be  admissible  as  an
admission  by  a  party-opponent,  the  special  rule  of  FRE  408
makes it inadmissible.
(B)  is  wrong  because  a  limiting  instruction  would  not  make
the  evidence  here  admissible.  FRE  408  makes  the  statement

464

inadmissible  as  a  statement  in  connection  with  a  settlement
negotiation, and that’s true if it’s offered to prove liability, not
just  if  it’s  offered  to  prove  damages.  So  the  limiting
instruction wouldn’t get around the FRE 408 problem.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  facts — the  settlement
offer is relevant. The settlement offer could be taken to mean
that  Carr  acknowledges  his  own  guilt.  Thus,  it’s  relevant  to
the issue of fault. The problem is that the evidence is barred
by  the  special  settlement-offers  rule  of  FRE  408,  not  that  it
fails to be relevant to any issue in the case.

465

CHAPTER 3
EXAMINATION AND IMPEACHMENT OF
WITNESSES

I.    PRESENT RECOLLECTION REFRESHED

AND OTHER TECHNIQUES

A.  Not evidence

Question 13: A defendant is sued for hitting a pedestrian with
his  car.  On  the  evening  of  the  day  of  the  accident,  a  person
who had been a passenger in the defendant’s car wrote a letter
to the passenger’s sister in which he described the accident.
When  the  passenger  testified  at  trial,  he  stated  that  he  could
not  remember  some  details  of  the  accident.  The  pedestrian’s
counsel now seeks to show him the letter to assist him in his
testimony  on  direct  examination.  The  trial  judge  should  rule
this

(A)    permissible,  under  the  doctrine  of  present  recollection

refreshed.

(B)    permissible,  under  the  doctrine  of  past  recollection

recorded.

(C)    objectionable,  because  the  letter  was  not  a  spontaneous

utterance.

(D)    objectionable,  because  the  letter  is  a  self-serving
declaration insofar as the passenger is concerned.
Answer  13:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Under  the  doctrine  of
present  recollection  refreshed,  any  item  may  be  used  to
refresh  the  witness’s  memory,  including  leading  questions,
documents,  or  objects.  If  the  witness,  having  seen  the
refreshing  object,  can  testify  from  memory,  the  item  will  not
be  considered  evidence.  See  FRE  612,  implicitly  allowing
the present recollection refreshed technique, subject to certain
limitations  (which  don’t  affect  the  outcome  here).  (If  the
witness cannot testify from memory even after reviewing the
item,  then  the  item  may  be  admissible  as  a  past  recollection
recorded,  if  the  situation  meets  the  requirements  of  FRE

466

803(5),  which  the  situation  here  has  not  yet  been  shown  to
do).  Here,  all  you’re  told  is  that  the  pedestrian’s  counsel  is
seeking  to  show  the  letter  to  the  passenger  to  help  the
passenger  testify.  This  “refreshment”  is  valid  under  the
present recollection refreshed technique.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  the  doctrine  of  past  recollection
recorded  has  not  yet  been  shown  to  apply  to  these  facts.
Under  FRE  803(5),  a  document  is  only  admissible  as  a  past
recollection recorded if it meets these requirements: (A) it “is
on  a  matter  the  witness  once  knew  about  but  now  cannot
recall  well  enough  to  testify  fully  and  accurately”;  (B)  it
“was  made  or  adopted  by  the  witness  when  the  matter  was
fresh in the witness’s memory”; and (C) it “accurately reflects
the witness’s knowledge.”

At the point in time you’re asked about, the letter does not yet
qualify  for  the  doctrine.  The  proponent  wants  to  show  the
witness  the  letter  “to  assist  him  in  his  testimony  on  direct
examination.” That’s a classic use of the present recollection
refreshed technique, in which the document does not become
evidence.  So  applying  the  doctrine  of  past  recollection
recorded  here  would  be  “jumping  the  gun” — it  should  only
be used as a last resort if the revivifying document does not,
in  fact,  jog  the  witness’s  memory  (and  in  that  case,  the
document itself would be evidence, not merely used “to assist
[the  witness]  in  his  testimony,”  which  is  the  use  that  you’re
asked to evaluate.)

(C) is wrong, because it ignores the fact that the letter can be
used to refresh the passenger’s memory, and because there is
no “spontaneous utterance” exception to the hearsay rule.
Choice C implicitly recognizes that there’s a hearsay problem
with  the  letter  itself.  Hearsay  is  an  out-of-court  statement
offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  its  assertion.  Here,  the  out-of-
court  declarant  is  the  passenger  himself.  However,  the  letter
isn’t  being  offered  into  evidence  at  all — it’s  merely  being
used  to  refresh  the  passenger’s  memory.  As  a  result,  its  use
does not need to satisfy a hearsay objection — the letter may
be  used  as  non-evidence,  under  the  doctrine  of  present
recollection refreshed.

temporal  proximity  to  the  accident  (since  it  was  not  written
until the evening of the day of the accident).

exception 

(D)  is  wrong,  because  the  self-serving  nature  of  the  letter
would  not  prevent  its  being  used  to  refresh  the  passenger’s
memory.  Choice  D  misses  the  mark  in  at  least  two  respects.
First,  it  suggests  that  the  letter  itself  is  being  offered  as
evidence.  In  fact,  it’s  not — all  that’s  happening  is  that  the
pedestrian’s  counsel  is  seeking  to  show  the  passenger  the
letter to help him with his testimony.

Second,  even  if  the  letter  were  being  offered  into  evidence,
the  self-serving  nature  of  the  letter  wouldn’t  be  a  problem,
because  the  self-serving  nature  of  any  evidence  affects  its
credibility,  not  its  admissibility.  Instead,  if  the  letter  itself
was  being  offered,  there’d  be  a  hearsay  problem,  since  it
would be an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth
of what it contains — namely, the passenger’s recollections of
the accident.

II.   IMPEACHMENT BY PRIOR BAD ACTS

A.  Federal Rule

1.  May bring out on cross

a.  Applies to any witness

Question 14:  In  an  automobile  negligence  action  by  Popkin
against  Dwyer,  Juilliard  testified  for  Popkin.  Dwyer  later
called  Watts,  who  testified  that  Juilliard’s  reputation  for
truthfulness was bad.
On cross-examination of Watts, Popkin’s counsel asks, “Isn’t
it  a  fact  that  when  you  bought  your  new  car  last  year,  you
made a false affidavit to escape paying the sales tax?”

468

This question is

(A)    proper,  because  it  will  indicate  Watts’s  standard  of

judgment as to reputation for truthfulness.
(B)  proper, because it bears on Watts’s credibility.
(C)  improper, because character cannot be proved by specific

instances of conduct.

(D)    improper,  because  one  cannot  impeach  an  impeaching

witness.

Answer  14:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  A  witness’s  credibility
may  be  impeached  by  evidence  of  specific  instances  of
conduct  reflecting  on  his  truthfulness,  but  only  by  the  cross-
examiner’s  making  “inquiry”  into  those  specific  instances
during  the  cross-examination  of  that  witness.  FRE  608(b).
Since  Watts  is  on  the  stand  and  being  cross-examined,  the
question  about  his  prior  act  of  dishonesty  meets  these
requirements  (it’s  probative  of  his  general  truthfulness,  and
what  Popkin’s  counsel  is  doing  is  merely  making  “inquiry”
into the act). The fact that Watts is a witness called solely to
give  impeachment  testimony,  as  opposed  to  substantive  or
occurrence-type testimony, doesn’t matter — any witness may
be  impeached  by  inquiry  into  specific  past  conduct  of  the
witness that is probative of untruthfulness.

(A)  is  wrong  because  Watts  is  not  being  asked  about  the
reputation  testimony,  but  is  instead  being  impeached  on
account  of  his  own  bad  acts.  So  what  Watts’  standard  is  for
judging reputation is not what the question is about.

(C) is wrong because there is an exception to the general rule
that,  for  the  purpose  of  attacking  a  witness’s  character  for
truthfulness, specific instances of conduct may not be proved
by extrinsic evidence. The judge may, in her discretion, allow
such evidence if it is brought out through cross examination of
the witness whose credibility is being attacked and if the bad
acts  are  probative  of  truthfulness  or  untruthfulness.  FRE
608(b).  Watts  is  being  cross-examined  with  evidence  of  his
falsifying an affidavit to avoid paying sales tax on the sale of
a new car. The act is probative of untruthfulness and is being
brought  out  on  cross-examination.  Therefore,  the  question  is
proper  even  though  it  involves  a  specific  instance  of  the

469

witness’s past conduct.

(D) is wrong because it states a non-existent rule: There is no
rule against “impeaching an impeaching witness.”

III.  IMPEACHMENT BY PRIOR INCONSISTENT

STATEMENT

A.  General rule

Question  15:  Davidson  and  Smythe  were  charged  with
burglary  of  a  warehouse.  They  were  tried  separately.  At
Davidson’s  trial,  Smythe  testified  that  he  saw  Davidson
commit the burglary. While Smythe is still subject to recall as
a  witness,  Davidson  calls  Smythe’s  cellmate,  Walton,  to
testify  that  Smythe  said,  “I  broke  into  the  warehouse  alone
because Davidson was too drunk to help.”
This evidence of Smythe’s statement is

(A)  admissible as a declaration against penal interest.
(B)  admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
(C)    inadmissible,  because  it  is  hearsay  not  within  any

exception.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  the  statement  is  not  clearly

corroborated.

Answer 15: Choice (B) is correct. Under FRE 613(b), when
a  witness  testifies  at  trial,  evidence  of  his  prior  inconsistent
statement  is  admissible  to  impeach  his  credibility  (if  a
foundation  is  laid  either  before  or  after  the  impeachment
where  the  witness  has  an  opportunity  to  explain  or  deny  the
statement and where the opposite party has the opportunity to
interrogate  the  witness).  Since  Smythe  is  “still  subject  to
recall  as  a  witness,”  the  foundation  can  be  laid.  In  addition,
some types of prior inconsistent statements are not barred by
the hearsay rule and may be admitted as substantive proof of
the matters contained in the statement — i.e., those made in an
earlier  trial  or  proceeding,  where  the  declarant  spoke  under
oath  and  subject  to  perjury  penalties.  FRE  801(d)(1).  Since
Smythe’s statement was not under oath, it may not be admitted
substantively.  Therefore,  the  statement  is  admissible  as  a
prior  inconsistent  statement,  but  only  for  impeachment

470

purposes. (Note that this answer is correct because Smythe is
a  non-party  in  this  action.  If  Smythe  were  on  trial  here,  his
prior statement would be admissible for substantive purposes,
as an admission.)

(A) is wrong because the declarant is available. Under FRE
804(b)(3),  the  requirements  for  the  declaration-against-
interest exception are: (1) the declaration must be against the
declarant’s pecuniary or proprietary interest when made; (2)
the declarant must be unavailable; and (3) the declarant must
have  had  first-hand  knowledge  of  the  facts  asserted  in  the
declaration.  The  fact  pattern  indicates  that  Smythe  is  still
subject to recall as a witness when Walton is testifying about
Smythe’s prior statement, so he is available.

(C) is wrong because, although it is correct in identifying the
statement  as  hearsay  not  within  any  exception,  it  does  not
recognize  that  the  statement  would  still  be  admissible  for
impeachment purposes.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  statement  is  admissible,  and  the
requirement of corroboration does not apply in the context of
a  prior  inconsistent  statement,  but  rather,  to  the  hearsay
exception  for  declarations  against  interest.  FRE  804(b)(3),
which  provides  for  the  hearsay  exception  for  declarations
against interest, denies the exception for a statement “offered
in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to
criminal  liability,”  unless  the  statement  “is  supported  by
its
corroborating  circumstances 
trustworthiness[.]” This is the source of the language in (D),
but  it  does  not  apply  here.  If  the  declarant  was  unavailable
and the exception was applied, then corroboration would  be
required.

B.  Special rules from FRE 613

1. 

  “Extrinsic  evidence,”  and  the  “explain  or  deny”  and
“interrogate” rules

Question 16: Perez sued Dawson for damages arising out of
an  automobile  collision.  At  trial,  Perez  called  Minter,  an
eyewitness  to  the  collision.  Perez  expected  Minter  to  testify
that she had observed Dawson’s automobile for five seconds
prior  to  the  collision  and  estimated  Dawson’s  speed  at  the

471

time of the collision to have been 50 miles per hour. Instead,
Minter  testified  that  she  estimated  Dawson’s  speed  to  have
been 25 miles per hour.

Without  finally  excusing  Minter  as  a  witness,  Perez  then
called Wallingford, a police officer, to testify that Minter had
told  him  during  his  investigation  at  the  accident  scene  that
Dawson “was doing at least 50.”

Wallingford’s testimony is

(A)  admissible as a present sense impression.
(B)  admissible to impeach Minter.
(C)    inadmissible,  because  Perez  may  not  impeach  his  own

witness.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  it  is  hearsay  not  within  any

exception.

to 

is  admissible 

Answer 16: Choice (B) is correct. Under FRE 613(b), when
a  witness  testifies  at  trial,  extrinsic  evidence  of  his  prior
inconsistent  statement 
impeach  his
credibility,  so  long  as  the  witness  has  an  opportunity  to
explain  or  deny  the  statement  and  the  opposite  party  has  the
opportunity  to  interrogate  the  witness  about  it.  Wallingford’s
testimony  as  to  Minter’s  statement  at  the  accident  scene 
— “the  driver  (defendant)  was  doing  at  least  50” — is
inconsistent with Minter’s previous testimony at trial that the
defendant’s  speed  was  25  miles  per  hour.  The  fact  pattern
indicates  that  Minter  was  not  excused  as  a  witness  and  that
therefore  there  exists  the  opportunity  for  him  to  explain  or
deny the statement and to be interrogated on it by the opposite
party (Dawson).

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  statement  was  not  made  close
enough to the time of the accident. FRE 803(1) provides for
the hearsay exception of a present sense impression, defined
as  a  statement  “describing  or  explaining  an  event  or
condition,  made  while  or  immediately  after  the  declarant
perceived  it.”  Minter’s  statement  was  made  to  the  police
officer during the investigation of the accident scene so it was
not made immediately after viewing the collision.
(C)  is  wrong  because  “Any  party,  including  the  party  that
called the witness, may attack the witness’s credibility.” FRE

472

607.

(D)  is  wrong  because  what  Minter  said  to  the  Officer  is  not
hearsay.  The  out-of-court  statement  at  issue  is  Minter’s
statement to the officer, “Dawson was doing at least 50.” But
the statement is not being offered to prove that Dawson really
was doing at least 50 — it’s merely being used to cast doubt
on the credibility of Minter’s in-court statement that Dawson
was  doing  25.  If  the  statement  to  the  officer  were  being
offered  as  substantive  evidence,  i.e.,  to  prove  that  Dawson
really was “doing at least 50,” then it would be inadmissible
hearsay.

a.  Application to hearsay declarants

Question  17:  A  defendant  is  charged  with  the  murder  of  a
victim.  The  prosecutor  introduces  testimony  of  a  police
officer  that  the  victim  told  a  priest,  administering  the  last
rites, “I was stabbed by [the defendant]. Since I am dying, tell
him I forgive him.” Thereafter, the defendant’s attorney offers
the testimony of a witness that the day before, when the victim
believed he would live, he stated that he had been stabbed by
a person other than the defendant.

The testimony of the witness is

(A)  admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.
(B)  admissible to impeach the dead declarant.
(C)  inadmissible, because it goes to the ultimate issue in the

case.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  it  is  irrelevant  to  any  substantive

issue in the case.

Answer  17:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  victim’s  initial
statement about the defendant was hearsay, but was properly
admitted  under  FRE  804(b)(2)’s  “dying  declaration”
exception, because it was made by a person now unavailable
to testify, believing he was about to die, concerning personal
knowledge of the cause of death, and the statement is offered
at  either  a  criminal  homicide  trial  or  a  civil  wrongful  death
suit.  Since  that  statement  came  in,  the  victim’s  prior
inconsistent  statement  (about  the  stabber  being  a  different
person,  not  the  defendant)  can  be  used  to  impeach  his
credibility,  since  hearsay  declarants  can  be  impeached.  See

473

FRE 806: “When a hearsay statement . . . has been admitted in
evidence, the declarant’s credibility may be attacked, and then
supported,  by  any  evidence  that  would  be  admissible  for
those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness.”

prior-inconsistent-statement 

Note that this impeaching evidence would not be admissible
substantively,  since  it  does  not  fulfill  the  requirements  of
hearsay
801(d)(1)(A)’s 
exclusion — the  prior 
is  only
admissible  substantively  if  the  statement  was  made  under
oath,  at  a  prior  proceeding,  subject  to  perjury,  with  the
declarant now being the testifying witness; here, the victim’s
statement about the third person was not made under oath or at
a proceeding, so it’s admissible only for impeachment.

inconsistent 

statement 

(A) is wrong, because the witness’s testimony does not fit an
exception  to  the  hearsay  rule;  it’s  inadmissible  hearsay.  In
particular,  the  statement  does  not  fit  the  most  obvious
exception,  the  “dying  declaration”  exception  to  the  hearsay
rule,  because  the  victim  did  not  have  an  impending  sense  of
death  when  he  made  the  statement.  FRE  804(b)(2).  The
rationale behind the exception is that no one wants to die with
a lie on his lips; where a person thinks he’s going to live, this
is not applicable. (Also, the statement will not be admissible
substantively as a prior inconsistent statement, for the reasons
discussed in Choice (B) above).

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  FRE  do  not  condition  the
admissibility  of  a  statement  on  whether  it  addresses  an
“ultimate issue.” See FRE 704(a).

(D)  is  wrong,  because  the  testimony  is  relevant  to  a
substantive issue in the case. A piece of evidence is logically
relevant if it tends to prove or disprove a material fact. FRE
401.  If  the  victim’s  prior  statement  about  the  third  person
being the stabber is true, it will tend to prove that the victim
was lying about the defendant’s stabbing him, and thus make it
less likely that the defendant is guilty of murder. As a result,
it’s extremely relevant!

IV.  IMPEACHMENT BY CONTRADICTION; THE

“COLLATERAL ISSUE” RULE

474

A.  Collateral issue rule

1.  Disallowed

Question  18:  A  plaintiff  sued  a  defendant  for  injuries  the
plaintiff  received  in  an  automobile  accident  where  the
defendant was the driver. The plaintiff claimed the defendant
was negligent in exceeding the posted speed limit of 35 m.p.h.
A bystander who saw the accident testified as an eyewitness
for  the  plaintiff  and  stated  on  cross-examination  that  the
defendant  was  wearing  a  green  sweater  at  the  time  of  the
accident.  At  the  start  of  the  defendant’s  case,  the  defendant
testified that he was going 30 m.p.h. The defendant’s counsel
then called a second witness, who also observed the accident,
to  testify  solely  that  the  defendant’s  sweater  was  blue.  The
second witness’s testimony is
(A)  admissible as substantive evidence of a material fact.
(B)  admissible as bearing on the bystander’s truthfulness and

veracity.

(C)  inadmissible, because it has no bearing on the capacity of

the bystander to observe.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  it  is  extrinsic  evidence  of  a

collateral matter. 

Answer 18: Choice (D) is correct. The defendant’s counsel is
attempting to impeach the bystander with evidence that is not
from  the  bystander’s  own  mouth — in  other  words,  by
“extrinsic” evidence. Evidence that only discredits a witness,
without  bearing  on  any  substantive  issues  in  the  case,  is
called “collateral,” and in most instances is not admissible if
it  is  extrinsic.  Evidence  that  discredits  the  witness  by
showing  that  the  witness  gave  incorrect  testimony  in  the
present case about an immaterial issue falls into this category
of inadmissible extrinsic evidence on collateral matters. The
FRE do not specifically recite this rule, but it is a common-
law rule that is universally observed by courts following the
FRE.  Here,  the  issues  in  the  case  involve  only  the  driving
behavior  of  the  defendant.  The  color  of  his  sweater  is  not  a
material issue; all the second witness’s testimony will serve
to  do  is  slightly  discredit  the  bystander  by  contradiction.  So
it’s  a  classic  illustration  of  the  “no  extrinsic  evidence  on

475

collateral matters” rule.

(A) is wrong because it mischaracterizes the facts: The color
of  the  defendant’s  sweater  is  not  a  material  fact  (it  doesn’t
relate to any of the substantive issues in the case). It is instead
a  “collateral”  matter — relevant  only  to  discredit  a  witness,
the  bystander.  As  such,  it  will  not  be  admissible,  under  the
common-law  rule  against  extrinsic  evidence  on  collateral
matters, applicable as a “gap filler” to cases governed by the
FRE.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  testimony  here  could  not  be
admitted  on  the  subject  of  the  bystander’s  truthfulness  and
veracity.  It’s  true  that  the  testimony  has  some  bearing  on  the
bystander’s  truthfulness,  because  it  contradicts  his  testimony
(and  thus  raises  the  question,  “If  he  is  lying  or  mistaken  on
this point, isn’t he likely to be lying or mistaken about some
really  important  fact  in  his  testimony?”)  But  because  the
contradiction about the color of the sweater does not touch on
any substantive issue in the case, and does not bear on other
issues  considered  highly 
important  aspects  of  witness
veracity  (e.g.,  presence  of  bias),  its  impeachment  effect  is
considered  minor,  and  not  worth  the  trouble  of  calling  a
separate  witness.  Therefore,  it  falls  within  the  general
common-law  rule  that  extrinsic  impeachment  evidence  on  a
collateral matter is not allowed.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  facts — the  testimony
would  (or  at  least  might)  bear  on  the  bystander’s  ability  to
observe.  Any  contradiction  of  witness  1’s  testimony  by
witness  2  about  a  matter  that  witness  1  said  he  observed
would  or  might  bear  on  witness  1’s  ability  to  observe.  But
where  the  contradiction  is  on  a  point  that  does  not  matter
substantively,  and  is  not  on  some  other  kind  of  issue  that  is
considered  important  to  credibility  (e.g.,  bias  on  the  part  of
witness  1),  the  contradiction  is  excludable  based  on  the
common-law  rule  barring  extrinsic  evidence  (i.e.,  evidence
from a separate witness or document) on a collateral matter.

CHAPTER 4
HEARSAY

I.    DEFINITION

A.  Definition

1.  Hearsay may be by the present witness

a.  Statement about what declarant previously said

Question 19:  Pawn  sued  Dalton  for  injuries  received  when
she  fell  down  a  stairway  in  Dalton’s  apartment  building.
Pawn, a guest in the building, alleged that she caught the heel
of  her  shoe  in  a  tear  in  the  stair  carpet.  Pawn  calls  Witt,  a
tenant, to testify that Young, another tenant, had said to him a
week before Pawn’s fall: “When I paid my rent this morning, I
told the manager he had better fix that torn carpet.”

Young’s statement, reported by Witt, is

(A)  admissible, to prove that the carpet was defective.
(B)  admissible, to prove that Dalton had notice of the defect.
(C)    admissible,  to  prove  both  that  the  carpet  was  defective

and that Dalton had notice of the defect.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  it  is  hearsay  not  within  any

exception.

Answer 19: Choice (D) is correct. Young’s statement, “I told
the manager he had better fix that torn carpet,” is an “out-of-
court statement” being offered to “prove the truth of the matter
asserted,”  that  Young  told  the  manager  about  the  needed
repair  and  that,  therefore,  the  manager  knew  of  the  ripped
carpet. In other words, Young’s out-of court-statement “I told
the  manager  X”  is  being  offered  to  show  that  Young,  the
declarant,  indeed  told  the  manager  X.  So  the  statement  is
inadmissible  hearsay  if  offered  for  that  purpose.  FRE  801.
(Notice that this would be hearsay whether or not X was itself
true.) And there is no other plausible purpose for which it is
being offered on these facts.
(A) is wrong because the statement is inadmissible to prove
that the carpet was defective, because it is hearsay not within

477

any  exception,  as  discussed  in  Choice  (D).  The  statement
can’t  tend  to  prove  that  the  carpet  was  defective  unless  the
trier  first  believes  that  Young  made  the  statement  about  a
defect to the manager; so the statement “Young told me he had
told  the  manager  X”  would  be  offered  to  prove  that  Young
indeed  told  the  manager  X,  and  that  would  be  an  offer  to
prove the truth of the matter asserted.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  statement  is  inadmissible  hearsay,
as  explained  in  the  discussion  of  (D).  Young’s  statement  “I
told the manager thus-and-such” is being offered to prove that
Young, the declarant, indeed told the manager thus-and-such.
So  even  if  the  statement  is  not  being  offered  to  prove  that
Young’s  statement  to  the  manager  was  true  (and  instead
offered to merely prove “notice” to the manager of a fact that
might  or  might  not  be  true),  Young’s  statement  to  Witt  that
Young  had  previously  made  the  statement  to  the  manager  is
inadmissible hearsay.

(C)  is  wrong  because,  as  discussed  in  (D),  the  statement  is
inadmissible for both these purposes.

B.  Illustrations

Question 20: In a jurisdiction without a Dead Man’s Statute,
a  plaintiff’s  estate  sued  a  defendant  claiming  that  the
defendant  had  borrowed  from  the  plaintiff  $10,000,  which
had  not  been  repaid  as  of  the  plaintiff’s  death.  The  plaintiff
was  run  over  by  a  truck.  At  the  accident  scene,  while  dying
from  massive  injuries,  the  plaintiff  told  a  police  officer  to
“make  sure  my  estate  collects  the  $10,000  I  loaned  to  the
defendant.”

The officer’s testimony about the plaintiff’s statement is
(A)  inadmissible, because it is more unfairly prejudicial than

probative.

(B)    inadmissible,  because  it  is  hearsay  not  within  any

exception.

(C)  admissible as an excited utterance.
(D)    admissible  as  a  statement  under  belief  of  impending

death.

Answer 20: Choice (B) is correct. First, let’s look at whether

478

the  statement  was  hearsay.  It’s  clearly  an  out-of-court
declaration.  And,  the  statement  includes  the  plaintiff’s
assertion that he’s owed $10,000 by the defendant, offered to
prove that the defendant does indeed owe this money. So the
statement easily fits within the definition of hearsay — out-of-
court  statement  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  matter
asserted.  Now,  does  some  exception  apply?  No.  The  two
most  plausible  ones  are  the  excited  utterance  exception  (not
applicable because the statement doesn’t relate to the exciting
event — see  the  discussion  of  Choice  (C)  below)  and  the
dying  declaration  exception  (not  applicable  because  the
statement  doesn’t  relate  to  the  cause  of  impending  death — 
see the discussion of Choice (D) below).

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  statement  here  is  not  especially
prejudicial,  so  it’s  unlikely  that  the  statement’s  probative
value would be found to be “substantially outweighed” by its
prejudicial effect, as FRE 403’s balancing test requires as a
basis for exclusion.

(C) 
is  wrong  because  FRE  803(2)’s  excited-utterance
exception applies to “a statement relating to a startling event
or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress
of  excitement  that  it  caused.”  As  you  can  see  from  the
italicized  phrase,  the  statement  has  to  relate  to  the  startling
event. The plaintiff’s comment here relates solely to the debt,
not to the startling event (the truck accident).

(D) is wrong because the plaintiff’s comment did not concern
the  cause  or  circumstance  of  his  death.  FRE  804(b)(2)’s
dying-declaration  exception  applies  to  (in  a  civil  case  or
homicide  prosecution)  “a  statement  that  the  declarant,  while
believing the declarant’s death to be imminent, made about its
cause  or  circumstances.”  Since  the  plaintiff’s  statement
related  only  to  the  collection  of  the  debt,  not  to  the  truck
accident that was about to cause his death, it doesn’t qualify.

II.   SPECIAL ISSUES

A.  “Truth of matter asserted”

1.  Verbal acts

479

Question  21:  In  a  suit  based  on  a  will,  inheritance  of  $1
million  depended  upon  whether  the  wife  had  survived  her
husband when both died in the crash of a small airplane. An
applicable  statute  provided  that,  for  purposes  of  distributing
an  estate  after  a  common  disaster,  there  was  a  rebuttable
presumption  that  neither  spouse  had  survived  the  other.  A
witness was called to testify that as she approached the plane
she heard what she thought was a woman’s voice saying, “I’m
dying,” although by the time the two occupants were removed
from the wreckage they were both dead.

Is the witness’s testimony admissible?

(A)    No,  because  the  matter  is  governed  by  the  presumption

that neither spouse survived the other.

(B)  No, because the witness’s testimony is too speculative to

support a finding.

(C)  Yes, because the hearsay rule does not apply to statements
by decedents in actions to determine rights under a will.
(D)  Yes, because it is relevant and not otherwise prohibited.
Answer 21: Choice (D)  is  correct.  The  witness  is  testifying
as  to  what  she  heard  someone  say  outside  of  the  courtroom.
But  this  is  not  hearsay,  because  although  the  witness  is
recounting  an  out-of-court  statement,  that  statement  is  not
being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein,
i.e., that the declarant was, in fact, dying. Rather, the statement
is being offered to prove only that it was made, because that
fact  has  independent  legal  significance.  As  such,  it  is
classified as a verbal act, i.e., an operative fact that gives rise
to legal consequences. Thus, the statement does not constitute
hearsay  as  defined  by  FRE  801(c)  and,  therefore,  is  not
barred  by  FRE  802.  And  it  is  relevant  as  it  helps  establish
that the wife survived the husband.
(A)  is  wrong  because  under  the  majority  common  law
“bursting  bubble”  rule,  which  is  followed  by  FRE  301,  a
presumption  disappears  when  sufficient  counterproof  is
offered  about  the  presumed  fact.  Here  the  testimony  of  the
witness,  although  not  conclusive,  is  sufficient  to  rebut  the
presumption  that  neither  spouse  survived  the  other  and  to
support  a  jury  finding  that  the  wife  outlived  the  husband.

480

Therefore,  the  presumption  is  no  longer  controlling,  and  the
witness’s testimony is admissible.

In any event, regardless of how (or even whether) the bursting
bubble  rule  applies,  the  witness’s  testimony  would  be
admissible — in  all  jurisdictions,  the  party  who  does  not
benefit  from  a  presumption  is  always  entitled  to  submit
otherwise-competent  evidence  rebutting  the  existence  of  the
presumed fact.

(B) is wrong because the testimony is not “too speculative.”
A  witness  need  not  be  absolutely  certain  of  matters  about
which the witness testifies. Here the testimony is based on the
perception and memory of a lay witness, and thus satisfies the
FRE 701 standard that lay testimony be “(a) rationally based
on  the  witness’s  perception;  [and]  (b)  helpful  to  clearly
understanding the witness’s testimony or to determining a fact
in issue[.]”

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  presumes  that  the  statement  is
hearsay.  But  the  statement  is  not  hearsay  under  FRE  801(c),
because it is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter
asserted.  Instead,  the  statement  is  an  operative  fact  being
offered  to  prove  that  the  woman  was  alive  at  the  time  she
made  the  statement;  so  the  mere  existence  of  the  statement
(regardless  of  its  “truth  value”)  is  relevant  on  the  issue  of
whether the speaker survived her husband, even if by only a
few minutes.

481

CHAPTER 5
HEARSAY EXCEPTIONS AND
EXCLUSIONS

I.    ADMISSIONS

A.  Personal admissions

Question  22:  A  plaintiff  sued  a  defendant  for  injuries
plaintiff  received  in  an  automobile  accident.  The  plaintiff
claims  the  defendant  was  negligent  in  (a)  exceeding  the
posted speed limit of 35 m.p.h., (b) failing to keep a lookout,
and (c) crossing the center line. The defendant testified in his
own behalf that he was going 30 m.p.h. On cross-examination,
the  plaintiff’s  counsel  did  not  question  the  defendant  with
regard to his speed. Subsequently, the plaintiff’s counsel calls
an  officer  to  testify  that,  in  his  investigation  following  the
accident,  the  defendant  told  him  he  was  driving  40  m.p.h.  If
offered to prove that the defendant exceeded the posted speed
limit, the officer’s testimony is

(A)  admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
(B)  admissible as an admission.
(C)  inadmissible, because it lacks a foundation.
(D)    inadmissible,  because  it  is  hearsay  not  within  any

exception.

Answer  22:  Choice  (B)  is  correct,  because  it  correctly
identifies  the  statement  as  an  admission,  and  declares  it
admissible  on  that  basis.  The  plaintiff  is  offering  the
defendant’s out-of-court statement to prove that the defendant
was  speeding.  Since  the  statement  is  being  offered  to  prove
the  truth  of  its  assertion,  the  statement  is  hearsay.  However,
the  statement  will  be  admissible  under  the  admission
exclusion to the hearsay rule. FRE 801(d)(2) gives a hearsay
exclusion for a statement that is “offered against an opposing
party and . . . (A) was made by the party in an individual or
representative  capacity[.]”  Since  the  statement  was  made  by
the defendant, and is being offered against him, it qualifies for
this 801(d)(2)(A) exclusion for personal admissions.

482

(A)  is  wrong,  because  the  hearsay  exception  for  prior
inconsistent  statements  does  not  apply  on  these  facts.  We’re
told  that  the  statement  is  being  offered  for  the  substantive
purpose  of  proving  that  the  defendant  was  speeding  (not
merely for the statement’s impeachment value of showing that
the defendant told a different story previously and is therefore
not  worthy  of  having  his  trial  testimony  believed).  FRE
801(d)(1)  gives  a  hearsay  exclusion  for  certain  prior
inconsistent  statements  by  the  witness,  namely,  where  “The
declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination about a
prior statement, and the statement: (A) is inconsistent with the
declarant’s testimony and was given under penalty of perjury
at  a 
in  a
trial,  hearing,  or  other  proceeding  or 
deposition[.]”  But  there  is  no  indication  that  the  defendant’s
prior  statement  being  recited  in  the  officer’s  testimony  was
given  at  a  “trial,  hearing,  or  other  proceeding  or  in  a
deposition[.]”  Therefore,  it  doesn’t  qualify  for  the  exclusion
for prior inconsistent statements by a witness. (Instead, it can
come  in  for  substantive  purposes  as  an  admission,  as
described in Choice (B).)

(C) is wrong, because it implicitly mischaracterizes the basis
on  which  the  officer’s  testimony  will  be  admissible.  The
central problem here addresses hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-
court  statement  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  its  assertion.
Since  the  officer’s  testimony  is  offered  to  prove  that  the
defendant  was  speeding,  it  is  being  offered  as  substantive
evidence.

This  choice  implicitly  (and  wrongly)  characterizes  the
officer’s testimony as being offered for its impeachment value
only.  The  choice  appears  to  be  referring  to  the  common-law
requirement  that  before  a  witness  could  be  impeached  by
showing  that  he  made  a  prior  inconsistent  statement,  a
foundation  had  to  be  laid  by  showing  the  witness  the
statement,  or  disclosing  its  contents  to  him.  But  FRE  613(a)
does  away  with  this  requirement  of  a  foundation  (“When
examining  a  witness  about  the  witness’s  prior  statement,  a
party  need  not  show  it  or  disclose  its  contents  to  the
witness.”) So the lack of a foundation here would not prevent
the  plaintiff  from  using  the  prior  statement  for  impeachment

483

only, if that was the plaintiff’s purpose (which the facts tell us
it  was  not — the  statement  was  offered  for  its  substantive
value).

(D) is wrong, because it fails to realize that the testimony will
be admissible as an admission. This choice correctly reflects
the  fact  that  the  defendant’s  statement  to  the  officer  is  being
offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  the
statement, and would thus normally be hearsay. What Choice
(D)  fails  to  realize  is  that  the  testimony  is  an  admission,
rendered non-hearsay by FRE 801(d)(2), as explained in the
discussion of Choice (B) above.

Question 23: A defendant ran into and injured the plaintiff, a
pedestrian.  The  plaintiff  alleges  that  the  defendant,  while
drunk,  struck  the  plaintiff,  who  was  in  a  duly  marked
crosswalk.  A  police  officer  investigated  the  accident,  and
plaintiff’s  counsel  wants  to  introduce  testimony  of  the
investigating police officer that the defendant told the officer,
“I think this was probably my fault.”

The trial judge should rule this testimony

(A)  admissible as a part of the res gestae.
(B)  admissible as an admission of a party.
(C)  inadmissible, because it includes a conclusion of law that

the declarant was not qualified to make.

(D)  inadmissible, because it constitutes an opinion rather than

an admission of specific facts.

Answer  23:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  This  choice  implicitly
recognizes  that  there’s  a  hearsay  problem  under  these  facts.
Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth
of  its  assertion.  Here,  the  out-of-court  declarant  is  the
defendant: “I think this was probably my fault.” The statement
is being offered to prove that the defendant was at fault, so it’s
hearsay,  and  it  will  only  be  admissible  if  it  fits  a  hearsay
exception or exclusion.
FRE  801(d)(2)  gives  a  hearsay  exclusion  for  a  “statement
[that] is offered against an opposing party and: (A) was made
by  the  party  in  an  individual  or  representative  capacity[.]”
Since  the  statement  was  made  by  the  defendant  in  an
individual  capacity,  and  is  being  offered  against  him,  it

484

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

qualifies for the admission exclusion.

(A)  is  wrong,  because  res  gestae  as  a  concept  is  not
recognized by the Federal Rules. At common law, res gestae
represented  the  group  of  spontaneous  hearsay  declarations
that were collectively considered admissible because of their
proximity to an act or event. What would be the res gestae at
common law is essentially covered, in the Federal Rules, by
the  categories  of  declarations  of  present  bodily  or  mental
state, excited utterances, and present sense impressions. Even
if  res  gestae  as  a  concept  were  recognized  by  the  Federal
Rules, it wouldn’t apply here, because the defendant made the
statement  at  the  police  station,  so  it  wouldn’t  be  sufficiently
proximate to the accident to be part of what the common law
would have called res gestae.

(C)  is  wrong,  because  it  misstates  the  law.  This  choice
suggests that the defendant’s statement will not be admissible
because it includes a conclusion of law, namely, that he’ll be
legally liable for causing the accident. However, admissions
by a party, introduced against that party, are not disqualified
from admissibility merely because they state a conclusion of
law.
(D) is wrong, because the fact that the statement included an
opinion is irrelevant. This choice suggests that the defendant’s
statement  will  not  be  admissible  because  it  includes  an
opinion  as  to  a  conclusion  of  law,  rather  than  a  statement
about  specific  facts.  However,  admissions  by  a  party,
introduced  against  that  party,  are  not  disqualified  from
admissibility merely because they state an opinion and do not
refer to specific facts.

1.  Question may not say “admission”

Question 24: A defendant was on trial for perjury for having
falsely testified in an earlier civil case that he knew nothing
about a business fraud. In the perjury trial, the defendant again
testified  that  he  knew  nothing  about  the  business  fraud.  In
rebuttal, the prosecutor called a witness to testify that after the
civil  trial  was  over,  the  defendant  admitted  to  the  witness
privately that he had known about the fraud.
Is the witness’s testimony in the perjury trial admissible?

485

(A)  Yes, but only to impeach the defendant’s testimony.
(B)    Yes,  both  to  impeach  the  defendant’s  testimony  and  as

substantive evidence of the perjury.

(C)  No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
(D)  No, because it relates to the business fraud and not to the

commission of perjury.

Answer  24:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  First,  let’s  consider  the
statement’s  admissibility  as  substantive  evidence  of  the
perjury.  The  witness  is  testifying  about  an  out-of-court
statement.  If  the  statement  is  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  its
contents,  i.e.,  that  the  declarant  knew  about  the  fraud,  this
would  meet  the  hearsay  definition  of  FRE  801(c).  But  the
declarant  is  the  defendant  in  this  case,  and  the  declarant’s
statement  is  being  offered  against  him.  Consequently,  the
statement is a party admission and, therefore, FRE 801(d)(2)
(A) says that it is deemed not hearsay. Since it is not hearsay,
it  is  admissible  to  prove  the  truth  of  its  contents  (i.e.,  as
substantive evidence of the perjury).

them 

generally 

The  statement  is  also  admissible  to  impeach  the  declarant’s
testimony, since it is a prior statement that is inconsistent with
the  declarant/defendant’s  testimony  at  the  present  (perjury)
trial.  Rule  613,  which  deals  with  prior 
inconsistent
for
statements,  makes 
impeachment, subject to some exceptions that are not relevant
here. In fact, where, as here, the prior inconsistent statement
was  made  by  one  who  is  a  party  opponent  in  the  present
proceeding,  Rule  613(b)  allows  use  of  “extrinsic  evidence”
(which is what the prosecutor’s witness’s statement is) of the
prior  inconsistent  statement  even  if  the  maker  of  the  prior
statement (here, the defendant) is not given an opportunity to
“explain or deny” the prior statement.

admissible 

(A)  is  wrong  because  although  the  testimony  is  certainly
admissible  to  impeach  the  defendant’s  testimony,  it  can  also
be  used  substantively  as  an  admission  by  a  party-opponent
under  FRE  801(d)(2)(A),  as  the  analysis  of  Choice  (B)
demonstrates.
(C)  is  wrong  because,  under  FRE  801(d)(2)(A),  a  statement
of  a  party-opponent  that  is  offered  against  that  party  is

486

deemed to be not hearsay.

(D)  is  wrong  because,  although  the  statement  made  to  the
witness does relate to the prior business fraud, it also relates
to  the  present  perjury  charge.  That’s  because  the  prior
statement  demonstrates  that  the  defendant  in  fact  did  know
about the fraud, despite his testimony in two trials that he did
not know of it. Thus the statement is relevant to prove that the
defendant’s  trial  testimony  was  knowingly  false  and  hence
constituted perjury.

Question  25:  The  defendant  was  prosecuted  for  homicide.
He testified that he shot in self- defense. In rebuttal, a police
officer  testified  that  he  came  to  the  scene  in  response  to  a
telephone call from the defendant. The officer offers to testify
that  he  asked,  “What  is  the  problem  here,  sir?”  and  the
defendant  replied.  “I  was  cleaning  my  gun  and  it  went  off
accidentally.”

The offered testimony is

(A)  admissible, as an excited utterance.
(B)  admissible, to impeach the defendant and as evidence that

he did not act in self-defense.

(C)  inadmissible, because of the defendant’s privilege against

self-incrimination.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  although  it  tends  to  expose  the
declarant  to  criminal  liability,  it  is  not  supported  by
corroborating circumstances.

Answer  25:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  First,  let’s  consider
whether  it’s  admissible  substantively,  i.e.,  to  prove  that  the
defendant  did  not  act  in  self-defense.  The  police  officer’s
testimony that the defendant had told him, “I was cleaning my
gun  and  it  went  off  accidentally,”  is  an  “out-of-court
statement” offered to “prove the truth of the matter asserted,”
so  it  would  on  its  face  be  hearsay  if  it’s  being  used  as
evidence  that  the  defendant  did  not  act  in  self-defense.
However, admissions of a party-opponent are treated as non-
hearsay  statements  and  are  admissible  under  FRE  801(d)(2)
(A). Next, once a statement is available substantively because
it’s  non-hearsay  (or  falls  within  a  hearsay  exception),  it  can
impeachment  purposes.  (A  separate
also  be  used  for 

487

provision,  FRE  613(b),  allows  for  impeachment  by  a  prior
inconsistent  statement,  but  use  of  this  provision  is  necessary
only when the witness is a non-party — if the witness that is
the target of impeachment is a party, as here, then it’s simpler
to  use  FRE  801(d)(2)(A)  to  get  the  statement  in  for  both
impeachment and substantive purposes.)

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  a  statement  is  an  excited
utterance  matters  only  if  the  statement  is  hearsay.  As
described in Choice (B), under the FRE admissions by a party
opponent  are  hearsay  “exclusions” — i.e.,  non-hearsay — so
the  statement  was  never  hearsay  in  the  first  place,  and  does
not  need  a  hearsay  exception  in  order  to  be  admitted.
Furthermore,  it’s  doubtful  that  the  defendant’s  statement
would  qualify  as  an  excited  utterance  even  if  offered  by,
rather than against, him (so that the statement was not a non-
hearsay  party-admission).  FRE  803(2)  defines  the  excited-
utterance hearsay exception this way: “a statement relating to
a startling event or condition made while  the  declarant  was
under the stress of excitement that it caused.” Here, there’s
no affirmative indication that the statement was being uttered
under  the  stress  of  excitement  from  the  shooting  (though  we
don’t know for sure).
(C)  is  wrong  because  application  of  the  Fifth  Amendment
privilege  of  self-incrimination  that  “no  person  .  .  .  shall  be
compelled  in  any  criminal  case  to  be  a  witness  against
himself  .  .  .”  applies  only  where  there  is  some  element  of
compulsion that brought about (or threatens to bring about) the
statement. So statements at a trial or other proceeding (e.g., a
grand  jury  hearing  or  deposition)  where  the  defendant  is
required to testify are covered. Similarly, statements made in
response  to  custodial  interrogation  are  covered  if  the
Miranda  warnings  weren’t  given,  because  Miranda  is  a
method  of  preventing  Fifth  Amendment  violations.  But  the
defendant’s out-of-court statement here did not fall into either
of these two categories. In particular, it is not covered by the
Miranda anti-self-incrimination policy, because the defendant
was not in custody at the time he made the statement, and no
other  element  of  compulsion  was  present.  (Also,  even  a
statement  by  a  defendant  that  was  given  in  custody  in

488

violation of Miranda may be used to impeach the defendant’s
contrary trial testimony; Harris v. N.Y. (1971).)

(D) is wrong because the principle cited does not apply in the
context  of  admissions,  but  rather,  to  the  declaration-against-
interest  hearsay  exception.  FRE  804(b)(3),  which  provides
for that exception, says that where a statement is “offered in a
criminal  case  as  one  that  tends  to  expose  the  declarant  to
criminal liability,” the exception applies only if the statement
“is  supported  by  corroborating  circumstances  that  clearly
indicate  its  trustworthiness.”  But  even  where  the  quoted
“corroboration”  language  applies  to  make  the  statement
the  declaration-against-interest  exception
ineligible 
(which  would  be  so  here),  that  ineligibility  doesn’t  prevent
the statement from being admissible as an admission against a
party-opponent, as described in the discussion of Choice B.

Question  26:  A  plaintiff  sued  a  ladder  manufacturer  for
injuries  he  suffered  to  his  neck  and  back  when  a  rung  of  the
ladder  on  which  he  was  standing  gave  way.  When  the
plaintiff’s back and neck continued to be very sore after more
than  two  weeks,  his  treating  physician  sent  him  to  an
orthopedist for an evaluation. Though the orthopedist did not
treat  the  plaintiff,  he  diagnosed  an  acute  cervical  strain.  At
trial,  the  plaintiff  called  the  orthopedist  to  testify  that  in
response  to  the  orthopedist’s  inquiry  about  how  the  plaintiff
had  injured  his  back,  the  plaintiff  told  him,  “I  was  standing
near the top of a 15-foot ladder when I abruptly fell, landing
hard  on  my  back,  after  which  the  ladder  toppled  onto  my

489

neck.”

Should the statement be admitted?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  plaintiff  is  present  and  can  be  cross-

examined about it.

(B)    Yes,  because  it  was  made  for  the  purpose  of  medical

diagnosis or treatment.

(C)  No, because it was not made to a treating physician.
(D)  No, because it relates to the inception or the cause of the
injury rather than the plaintiff’s physical condition.
Answer 26: Choice (B) is correct. The witness orthopedist is
testifying about an out-of-court statement to prove the truth of
the  contents  of  that  statement.  So  the  statement  meets  the
definition  of  hearsay  under  FRE  801(c).  (Although  the
declarant is a party to the case, the statement is being offered
by that party, so is not a party admission within FRE 801(d)
(2)(A).)  But  this  hearsay  statement  fits  within  the  exception
codified  at  FRE  803(4)  for  statements  made  for  the  purpose
of  (and  reasonably  pertinent  to)  medical  diagnosis  or
treatment,  where  the  statement  describes  “medical  history;
past  or  present  symptoms  or  sensations;  their  inception;  or
their general cause.” Both of these requirements are met: The
plaintiff’s statement relates to the cause of his injury, and the
cause of his injury is relevant to the orthopedist’s diagnosis.
Moreover,  Rule  803(4)  allows  not  only  statements  made  to
treating physicians, but also statements made to other doctors
for  evaluation  or  diagnosis.  So  the  fact  that  the  orthopedist
never  treated  the  plaintiff  doesn’t  affect  admissibility  of  the
statement. And, by the way, this exception applies regardless
of  whether  or  not  the  declarant  is  unavailable  to  testify  at
trial.

(A) is wrong because the choice gives an incorrect reason for
the correct outcome. The statement is an admissible statement
for  purposes  of  medical  diagnosis  or  treatment  under  FRE
803(4).  While  it  is  true  that  the  plaintiff  is  present  and
presumably could be cross-examined about the statement, this
exception  to  the  hearsay  rule  does  not  depend  on  the
statement  would  be
declarant’s  being  present — the 
admissible even if the plaintiff were not present to testify or

490

be cross-examined.

(C)  is  wrong  because  FRE  803(4)  does  not  require  that  the
statement  be  made  to  a  treating  physician — the  Rule  also
admits statements made to a non-treating doctor for purposes
of  diagnosis.  The  Rule  is  specifically  designed  to  admit
statements  such  as  this,  where  an  injured  party  is  seeking  a
diagnosis and opinion from a medical specialist.

(D)  is  wrong  because  FRE  803(4)  expressly  permits  the
introduction of statements concerning the cause of injury when
that information is pertinent to diagnosis or treatment. Thus it
is admissible under FRE 803(4).

(If  the  statement  related  to  fault — e.g.,  “I  fell  when  D
tripped  over  the  base  of  the  ladder” — then  the  part  of  the
statement relating to fault would likely not be covered by the
803(4) exception.)

Question  27:  In  a  civil  action  for  personal  injury,  Payne
alleges that he was beaten up by Dabney during an altercation
in  a  crowded  bar.  Dabney’s  defense  is  that  he  was  not  the
person who hit Payne. To corroborate his testimony about the
cause  of  his  injuries,  Payne  seeks  to  introduce,  through  the
hospital  records  custodian,  a  notation  in  a  regular  medical
record  made  by  an  emergency  room  doctor  at  the  hospital
where  Payne  was  treated  for  his  injuries.  The  notation  is:
“Patient says he was attacked by Dabney.”

The notation is

                    A) inadmissible, unless the doctor who made the
record  is  present  at  trial  and  available  for  cross-
examination.

(B)  inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
(C)  admissible as hearsay within the exception for records of

regularly conducted activity.

(D)    admissible  as  a  statement  made  for  the  purpose  of

medical diagnosis or treatment.

Answer 27: Choice (B) is correct. The out-of-court statement
(the  note  in  the  file)  is  being  offered  to  prove  that  Payne
really was attacked by Dabney. That’s a hearsay use, since the
out-of-court statement about what “the Patient” said about the

491

cause of the injuries is being offered to prove that these really
were  the  causes.  No  hearsay  exception  applies — see  the
discussion  of  the  other  three  answers  for  why  some  of  the
possible exceptions don’t apply. In particular, notice that this
is a two-level hearsay problem; the outer level is an out-of-
court statement (the notation) by the E.R. doctor, and the inner
level is the oral statement by the patient that was supposedly
being  recorded.  Unless  each  of  the  levels  is  shown  to  fall
within  a  hearsay  exception,  the  entire  notation  must  be
excluded.  And  the  inner  level  does  not  fall  within  any
exception.

(A)  reaches  the  right  conclusion,  but  for  the  wrong  reasons.
There is no hearsay exception that applies merely because the
person  who  records  an  out-of-court  declaration  (here,  the
doctor  who  records  a  patient’s  out-of-court  declaration)  is
available for cross-examination.

(C)  is  wrong  because  this  is  a  two-level  hearsay  problem,
and this choice only deals with the outer level. If the notation
concerned  solely  a  fact  personally  observed  by  the  E.R.
doctor (e.g., “I measured Patient’s blood pressure and found it
to be 130/80”), the notation probably would be admissible as
a record of regularly conducted activity. But here, the notation
is  a  quotation  of  someone  else’s  statement  (Payne’s),  so
Payne’s  statement  is  the  “inner”  level  of  hearsay,  and  that
statement does not fall within any hearsay exception.

their  general  cause,”  are  admissible 

(D)  is  wrong,  because  the  statement  does  not  fall  under  the
purpose-of-medical-diagnosis-or-treatment  exception,  since
the  identification  of  the  attacker  was  not  pertinent  to  the
diagnosis or treatment of Payne’s injuries. Under FRE 803(4),
statements  describing  “symptoms  or  sensations”  or  “their
inception  or 
if
.  medical  diagnosis  or
. 
“reasonably  pertinent  to 
treatment.”  Payne’s  statements  to  his  doctor  that  he  was
attacked and how  he  was  attacked  might  well  be  admissible
under  FRE  803(4)  on  the  theory  that  they  were  “reasonably
pertinent  to  medical  diagnosis  or  treatment.”  However,  a
statement identifying  his  attacker  will  not  help  in  treatment
or diagnosis in any way, and is therefore inadmissible under
this exception.

B.  Declaration of present mental, emotional, or physical condition

1.  State of mind directly in issue

Question  28:  In  a  prosecution  of  Dale  for  murdering  Vera,
Dale  testified  that  the  killing  had  occurred  in  self  defense
when  Vera  tried  to  shoot  him.  In  rebuttal,  the  prosecution
seeks  to  call  Walter,  Vera’s  father,  to  testify  that  the  day
before  the  killing,  Vera  told  Walter  that  she  loved  Dale  so
much she could never hurt him.

Walter’s testimony is

(A)  admissible within the hearsay exception for statements of

the declarant’s then existing state of mind.

(B)  admissible, because Vera is unavailable as a witness.
(C)  inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
(D)  inadmissible, because Vera’s character is not an issue.
Answer 28: Choice (A) is correct. When the mental state of a
declarant  is  directly  at  issue  in  a  case,  statements  of  the
declarant’s  then  existing  state  of  mind  are  admissible  under
FRE  803(3)  to  prove  the  declarant’s  mental  state  pre-dating
or  post-dating  the  statement.  Here,  Vera’s  statement,  that  she
loved Dale and she could never hurt him, is being offered to
prove the truth of the matter asserted, that she could not hurt
him,  and  that  therefore,  the  next  day,  it  is  unlikely  that  she
would  have  been  the  first  aggressor  in  the  encounter  with
Dale. This evidence would counter Dale’s claim that he acted
in self-defense.

is  wrong  because 

the  declarant’s  availability 

(B) 
is
immaterial  when  a  statement  is  being  offered  under  the
exception for a then existing state of mind under FRE 803(3).
(C)  is  wrong  because  the  statement  is  admissible  under  the
then  existing  state  of  mind  hearsay  exception  provided  by
FRE 803(3), as explained in the discussion of Choice A.
(D) is wrong because (1) the statement is admissible and (2)
it does not reflect on Vera’s “character,” but rather, her state
of mind, as further discussed in (A).

2.  Proof of subsequent event

Question 29:  Prine  sued  Dover  for  an  assault  that  occurred

493

March 5 in California. To support his defense that he was in
Utah  on  that  date,  Dover  identifies  and  seeks  to  introduce  a
letter he wrote to his sister a week before the assault in which
he stated that he would see her in Utah on March 5.

The letter is

(A)    admissible,  within  the  state  of  mind  exception  to  the

hearsay rule.

(B)    admissible,  as  a  prior  consistent  statement  to  support

Dover’s credibility as a witness.

(C)  inadmissible, because it lacks sufficient probative value.
(D)  inadmissible, because it is a statement of belief to prove

the fact believed.

Answer 29: Choice (A) is correct. A statement is admissible
to prove that a plan, design, or intention of the declarant was
in  fact  carried  out  by  the  declarant,  under  the  hearsay
exception  for  a  statement  concerning  a  declarant’s  present
mental,  emotional  or  physical  condition.  FRE  803(3).  That
provision allows for the introduction of a statement showing
that  the  declarant  had  the  intent  to  take  a  certain  action,  in
order  to  prove  that  the  declarant  did  in  fact  eventually  take
that action where whether that act took place is an issue in the
case. Here, Dover’s stated intention to meet his sister in Utah
on March 5 is admissible to prove that he in fact was in Utah
on March 5; therefore, it is evidence that he did not commit an
assault in California on that same day.

(B) is wrong because the general rule is that evidence offered
to bolster the character of a witness is not admissible. Under
FRE 801(d)(1)(B), a statement consistent with the declarant’s
testimony may only be “offered to rebut an express or implied
charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a
recent improper influence or motive in so testifying.” The fact
pattern  does  not  indicate  that  those  circumstances  occurred
here.
(C)  is  wrong  because  the  letter  is  admissible  and  it,  in  fact,
has sufficient probative value. It makes the factual proposition
that Dover was not in California on March 5 more likely than
it would be without the evidence.
(D) is wrong because the letter is admissible and the concept

494

the  declarant’s 

stated does not apply. It’s true that FRE 803(3) provides for
an  exception  for 
then  existing  mental,
emotional  or  physical  condition,  “but  not  including  a
statement  of  memory  or  belief  to  prove  the  fact  remembered
or believed unless it relates to the . . . declarant’s will.” But,
here, the letter is not a statement of belief about past actions
or events. It is a stated intention to do something in the future,
as explained in the discussion of (A).

3.  Need for inference

Question 30: Daggett is prosecuted for the murder of Vales,
whose  body  was  found  one  morning  in  the  street  near
Daggett’s house. The state calls Witt, a neighbor, to testify that
during  the  night  before  the  body  was  found  he  heard  Vales’s
wife scream, “You killed him! You killed him!”

Witt’s testimony is

(A)  admissible as a report of a statement of belief.
(B)  admissible as a report of an excited utterance.
(C)    inadmissible,  because  it  reports  a  privileged  spousal

communication.

(D)  inadmissible on spousal immunity grounds, but only if the

wife objects.

Answer  30:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  wife’s  statement  is
hearsay,  an  “out-of-court  statement”  offered  to  “prove  the
truth  of  the  matter  asserted” — that  Daggett  was  the  killer.
FRE  801.  FRE  803(2)  provides  for  the  excited  utterance
exception  to  the  hearsay  rule — “a  statement  relating  to  a
startling  event  or  condition  made  while  the  declarant  was
under  the  stress  of  excitement  that  it  caused.”  The  screamed
exclamation,  “You  killed  him!  You  killed  him!”  would
qualify — the  fact  that  there  was  a  scream  strongly  suggests
that  Vale’s  wife  was  responding  to  some  event  that  (1)
startled  her,  (2)  convinced  her  that  her  husband  had  been
killed (the event), and (3) induced her to make the statement
(showing  causation  between  the  startling  event,  and  the
statement).

(A) is wrong because it relies on a concept that doesn’t exist.
There  is  no  hearsay  exception  provided  for  a  “statement  of
belief.” Indeed, FRE 803(3) indicates just the contrary, since

495

it  gives  a  hearsay  exception  for  “A  statement  of  the
declarant’s then existing state of mind . . . but not including a
statement  of  memory  or  belief  to  prove  the  fact  remembered
or believed[.]”

(C) is wrong because the evidence would not be barred by the
confidential  spousal  communications  privilege.  If  the  wife
thought  her  husband  was  dead,  she  could  not  have  been
intending  to  communicate  with  him  (barring  communications
with the other world, which are presumably not protected by
the privilege).

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  evidence  is  not  barred  by  the
adverse  testimony  privilege.  The  privilege  applies  only  to
testimony against the spouse of the declarant. So there are two
problems here: (1) the husband (the declarant’s spouse) is not
on trial; and (2) this out-of-court startled exclamation would
not  be  deemed  to  be  “testimonial”  for  purposes  of  the
adverse-testimony  privilege,  even  if  it  were  used  by  the
prosecution against the husband.

III.  PAST RECOLLECTION RECORDED

A.  Exception under the FRE

1.  Four requirements

Question 31: A plaintiff sued a defendant for wrongful death
arising  out  of  a  traffic  collision  between  the  plaintiff’s
decedent  and  the  defendant.  At  trial,  the  investigating  traffic
officer  authenticated  a  tape  recording  of  her  shift-end
dictation of comments used in preparing the written report of
her factual findings. She testified that the tape recording was
accurate  when  made  and  that  she  currently  had  no  clear
memory of the details of the investigation.
Is the tape recording admissible as evidence?
(A)  Yes, under the past recollection recorded exception to the

hearsay rule.

(B)    Yes,  under  the  public  records  exception  to  the  hearsay

rule.

(C)    No,  because  it  is  hearsay  and  is  a  police  report  being

offered against the defendant in a wrongful death case.

496

(D)  No, because the police report itself is the best evidence.
Answer  31:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  tape  recording  is
evidence  of  an  oral  out-of-court  statement  that  is  being
offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  contents  of  that  statement.
Thus it is hearsay under FRE 801(c). But it also satisfies the
requirements  of  FRE  803(5),  the  past  recollection  recorded
exception  to  the  hearsay  rule.  Under  that  rule,  a  record  is
admissible  if  it  “(A)  is  on  a  matter  the  witness  once  knew
about  but  now  cannot  recall  well  enough  to  testify  fully  and
accurately; (B) was made or adopted by the witness when the
matter was fresh in the witness’s memory; and (C) accurately
reflects the witness’s knowledge.”

So here all four of the requirements embedded in FRE 803(5)
are  met:  (1)  we  know  that  the  “witness  once  knew  about”
requirement  is  satisfied  because  we’re  told  that  she  was  the
investigating officer, and was dictating an account of what she
had  learned  first-hand;  (2)  we  know  she  “now  cannot  recall
[the  matter]  well  enough  to  testify  fully  and  accurately”
because  we’re  explicitly  told  in  the  facts  that  she  “currently
ha[s] no clear memory of the details”; (3) we know that she
“made  [the  record]  when  the  matter  was  fresh  in  [her]
memory” from the fact that she made the tape recording at the
end of the very shift in which she learned the underlying facts
to which the recording pertained; and (4) we know the record
“accurately  reflects  the  witness’s  knowledge”  because  the
facts tell us that the witness “testified that the tape recording
was  accurate  when  made.”  Accordingly,  under  FRE  803(5),
the recording is admissible evidence (in the sense that it can
be played for the jury, although not taken into the jury room as
an exhibit).
(B)  is  wrong  because  although  the  officer’s  formal  written
report  would  qualify  as  a  public  record  under  FRE  803(8),
the informal dictated comments she made to help her prepare
the  report  would  not.  To  be  admissible  under  803(8),  the
material must fall within one of clauses (A)(i), (A)(ii), or (A)
(iii) of 803(8). All of these apply to “a record or statement of
a public office.” Let’s see why none of these clauses applies:
Clause  (A)(i)  of  803(8)  covers  reports  of  “the  office’s
activities.” The clause is interpreted to refer to records of the

497

internal activities of the agency, not to its inquiries into events
occurring in the outside world. So the recording here does not
qualify,  since  it’s  not  about  the  police  department,  but  about
real-world non-police activities.

Clause  (A)(ii)  of  803(8)  covers  a  public  office’s  record  or
statement  setting  out  “a  matter  observed  while  under  a  legal
duty to report, but not including, in a criminal case, a matter
observed by law-enforcement personnel.” (A)(ii) is generally
interpreted to cover only material that is “more concrete and
simple than interpretive or evaluative” (see M&K, § 8.50, p.
862), so it would not apply to the dictated notes here, which
clearly  have  an  evaluative  component.  (Who  caused  the
accident, which the officer didn’t personally witness?)

its 

terms  covers  “factual 

Clause (A)(iii) of 803(8) covers public records or statements
offered  “in  a  civil  case  or  against  the  government  in  a
criminal case,” if the record or statement consists of “factual
findings from a legally authorized investigation.” The fact that
this  is  a  civil  action  does  not  bar  (A)(iii)  use  here.  But  (A)
(iii)  by 
the
preliminary,  informal  tape-recording  here  would  not  be
construed to have produced such “factual findings” (a phrase
that  has  the  connotation  of  final  and  formal  conclusions),
especially  given  that  the  traffic  officer  knew  that  she  would
later  use  her  recording  in  order  to  prepare  her  eventual
“written report of her factual findings.” (The written report is
a document that would satisfy clause (A)(iii).)

findings,”  and 

So none of the three clauses of 803(8) applies.

(C) is wrong because although the tape recording is hearsay,
it  fits  the  hearsay  exception  of  FRE  803(5)  as  a  past
recollection  recorded.  This  choice’s  reference  to  a  “police
report being offered against the defendant in a wrongful death
case”  is  an  attempt  to  trick  you  into  thinking  that  the
prohibition in 803(8), clause (A)(iii), applies. As is covered
in more detail in the analysis of Choice (B) above, 803(8)’s
public-records hearsay exception says, in clause (A)(iii), that
“factual  findings  resulting  from  an 
investigation  made
pursuant  to  authority  granted  by  law”  are  admissible  only  in
civil actions and against the government in criminal cases, not
against  the  accused  in  a  criminal  case.  And  there  is  some

498

(though  weak)  authority  that  where  factual  findings  by  law
enforcement  officials  are  prohibited  by  803(8)(A)(iii)  (i.e.,
where the findings are proposed to be used by the government
against the accused), not only can’t Rule 803(8) be used, but
neither can other exceptions, like past recollection recorded.
But  even  in  a  court  following  this  minority  authority,  the
803(8)(A)(iii)  prohibition  wouldn’t  apply  here,  since  the
prohibition doesn’t apply in a civil case, even one involving
wrongful death.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  tape  recording  was  made  prior  to
the  written  report  and  was  used  as  a  basis  for  the  written
report. The recording is not being offered to prove the content
of  the  written  report,  so  its  admission  does  not  violate  the
best  evidence/original  document  rule  of  FRE  1002.  (If  the
officer  gave  courtroom  testimony  that  the  previous  day,  she
had listened to the recording and here is what it said, then this
testimony  would  violate  the  original  document  rule  of  FRE
1002,  because  the  recording  itself  would  have  to  be  offered
as the best evidence of what the recording’s contents were.)

IV.  RECORDS OF REGULARLY CONDUCTED
ACTIVITY (a/k/a “BUSINESS RECORDS”)

A.  Person supplying info

1.  Consumer complaints or reports

Question  32:  Plaza  Hotel  sued  Plaza  House  Hotel  for
infringement  of  its  trade  name.  To  establish  a  likelihood  of
name  confusion,  Plaintiff  Plaza  Hotel  offers  a  series  of
memoranda which it had asked its employees to prepare at the
end  of  each  day  listing  instances  during  the  day  in  which
telephone  callers,  cab  drivers,  customers,  and  others  had
confused the two names.
The memoranda should be
(A)  excluded, because they are more unfairly prejudicial and

confusing than probative.

(B)    excluded,  because  they  are  hearsay  not  within  any

exception.

(C)  admitted, because they are records of regularly conducted

499

business activity.

(D)  admitted, because they are past recollection recorded.
Answer 32:  The  correct  choice  is  (B) — this  is  hearsay  not
within any exception. Each memorandum contains a statement
of  the  form,  “Person  X  confused  Plaza  Hotel  with  Plaza
House Hotel,” offered to prove that the person indeed had this
confusion. So each memo is being offered to prove the truth of
the matter asserted in it (that confusion existed). Unless some
hearsay exception applies, the memos must be excluded under
the  hearsay  rule.  No  exception  applies,  including  the
exceptions mentioned in Choices (C) and (D).

(A) is wrong for two reasons. First, under FRE 403, evidence
is  excludable  based  on  the  relative  probative  value  and
prejudice  only  if  the  probative  value  is  “substantially
outweighed”  by  the  danger  of  unfair  prejudice  or  confusion,
and  the  formulation  here  omits  the  word  “substantially,”
incorrectly suggesting that if unfair prejudice and confusion is
slightly  greater  than  probative  value,  exclusion  must  occur.
Second,  the  court  would  never  even  get  to  the  issue  of
balancing  probative  value  against  prejudice,  because  the
evidence is hearsay not within any exception. (FRE 403 only
matters in the case of otherwise-admissible evidence.)

the  “business  records”  exception,  and 

(C) is wrong, because this choice refers to what is commonly
known  as 
the
requirements for that exception are not met here. FRE 803(6)
provides for the business record hearsay exception if “(A) the
record  was  made  at  or  near  the  time  by — or  from
information  transmitted  by — someone  with  knowledge;  (B)
the  record  was  kept  in  the  course  of  a  regularly  conducted
activity  of  a  business,  organization,  occupation,  or  calling,
whether or not for profit; (C) making the record was a regular
practice of that activity; (D) all these conditions are shown by
the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or
by a certification that complies with Rule 902(11) or (12) or
with  a  statute  permitting  certification;  and  (E)  neither  the
source  of  information  nor  the  method  or  circumstances  of
preparation  indicate  a  lack  of  trustworthiness.”  The  memos
here  don’t  satisfy  clause  (E) — the  circumstances  of
preparation  (anticipation  of  litigation,  and  the  hotel’s  strong

500

self-interest) make the records untrustworthy.

(D) is wrong because several of the prerequisites laid out in
FRE  803(5)  for  past  recollection  recorded  have  not  been
satisfied. For instance, there is no sponsoring witness who is
testifying,  as  to  each  memorandum,  that  the  memo  is  “on  a
matter  the  witness  once  knew  about  but  cannot  now  recall
well  enough  to  testify  fully  and  accurately.”  (803(5)(A)).
Similarly, there is no sponsoring witness who is testifying that
the  memo  was  “made  or  adopted  by  the  witness  when  the
matter was fresh in the witness’s memory” (803(5)(B)).

V.   PUBLIC RECORDS AND REPORTS

A.  Public records and reports

1.  Federal Rule

a.  Matters observed under duty

Question 33: A plaintiff sued his insurance company for the
full  loss  of  his  banquet  hall  by  fire.  The  insurance  company
defended under a provision of the policy limiting liability to
50  percent  if  “flammable  materials  not  essential  to  the
operation  of  the  business  were  stored  on  the  premises  and
caused  a  fire.”  The  insurance  company  called  the  keeper  of
the  city  fire  inspection  records  to  identify  a  report  prepared
and  filed  by  the  fire  marshal  as  required  by  law,  indicating
that  shortly  before  the  fire,  the  fire  marshal  had  cited  the
plaintiff for storing gasoline at the banquet hall.

Is the report admissible?

(A)  No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
(B)  No, because the proceeding is civil, rather than criminal.
(C)  Yes, as a public record describing matters observed as to

which there was a duty to report.

(D)  Yes, as a record of regularly conducted activity, provided

the fire marshal is unavailable.

Answer 33:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  report  is  an  out-of-
court  written  statement  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  its
contents,  so  it  meets  the  hearsay  definition  of  FRE  801(c).
Nevertheless,  it  is  admissible  because  it  falls  within  the

501

hearsay  exception  for  “public  records  and  reports”  codified
at  FRE  803(8).  Under  Clause  (A)(ii)  of  this  rule,  a  report
made  by  a  public  official  or  agency  concerning  “a  matter
observed while under a legal duty to report, but not including,
in  a  criminal  case,  a  matter  observed  by  law-enforcement
personnel”  is  admissible,  as  long  as  “neither  the  source  of
information  nor  other  circumstances  indicate  a  lack  of
trustworthiness”  (Clause  (B)).  All  of  the  requirements
embedded  in  Clauses  (A)(ii)  and  (B)  are  met:  (1)  The  fire
marshal  is  a  public  official;  (2)  we  know  that  the  report
concerned a matter that the marshal “observed,” since the fact
that he issued the citation indicates that he observed gasoline
being  stored  in  the  banquet  hall;  and  (3)  we  know  that  the
report  concerned  something  observed  “while  under  a  legal
duty  to  report,”  because  the  facts  tell  us  that  the  report  was
prepared  and  filed  “as  required  by  law.”  As  to  the  “lack  of
trustworthiness” proviso, there is no suggestion of any reason
to  believe  that  the  report’s  contents  are  untrustworthy.  Thus,
the  report  meets  the  requirements  of  the  FRE  803(8)  public
records exception to the hearsay rule, making it admissible.

(A)  is  wrong  because  this  report  is  admissible  as  a  public
record under FRE 803(8). See the analysis of Choice (C) for
why this is so.
(B) is wrong because the fact that this is a civil case does not
make  the  report  inadmissible.  Public  records  are  admissible
in both civil and criminal cases. In fact, they are more broadly
admissible in civil cases than in criminal cases, because law
enforcement  reports  are  generally  not  admissible  against
criminal  defendants.  See  the  analysis  of  Choice  (C)  for  why
the report here is admissible as a public record.
(D) is wrong because it incorrectly states how the regularly-
conducted-activity exception works. This choice is correct in
suggesting that the hearsay exception for records of regularly
conducted  activity  contained  in  FRE  803(6)  (commonly
called  the  “business  records”  exception)  would  likely  apply
to  this  report.  But  the  choice  is  incorrect  in  stating  that  the
exception will apply only if the fire marshal is unavailable to
testify.  The  803(6)  business-records  exception,  like  all  the
exceptions contained in FRE 803, does not require a showing

502

of the unavailability of the declarant (here, the fire marshal).

B.  Absence of public record

Question 34: In an arson prosecution the government seeks to
rebut the defendant’s alibi that he was in a jail in another state
at  the  time  of  the  fire.  The  government  calls  a  witness  to
testify that he diligently searched through all the records of the
jail  and  found  no  record  of  the  defendant’s  having  been
incarcerated there during the time the defendant specified.

The testimony of the witness is

(A)    admissible  as  evidence  of  absence  of  an  entry  from  a

public record.

(B)  admissible as a summary of voluminous documents.
(C)    inadmissible,  because  it  is  hearsay  not  within  any

exception.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  the  records  themselves  must  be

produced.

Answer 34:  The  correct  choice  is  (A),  because  this  type  of
“absence of a public record” evidence is admissible and falls
within a hearsay exception given by FRE 803(10).

The fact that the records are silent here is a form of hearsay:
The records are an out-of-court statement, and they’re offered
to  say,  in  essence,  “Because  the  records  don’t  say  that  the
defendant was incarcerated on a particular date, he was not in
fact  incarcerated  on  that  date.”  So  the  silence  would  not,
strictly  speaking,  be  admissible  unless  there  were  a  hearsay
exception to cover the situation.

But  there  is  such  an  exception.  FRE  803(10),  entitled
“Absence of a public record,” gives a hearsay exception for
“Testimony  .  .  .  that  a  diligent  search  failed  to  disclose  a
public  record  or  statement,”  if  the  testimony  is  admitted  to
prove  that  “(B)  a  matter  did  not  occur  or  exist,  if  a  public
office regularly kept a record or statement for a matter of that
kind.”  Here,  we  know  that  if  the  defendant  had  been
incarcerated  at  a  particular  jail  on  a  particular  date,  there
would  be  a  record  at  the  jail  to  that  effect.  So  the  proffered
testimony  that  a  search  of  the  jail’s  collected  attendance
records  showed  no  such  record  meets  the  requirements  of

503

FRE 803(10). (Notice, by the way, that the witness need not
be  an  employee  of  the  jail,  or  even  of  the  government — 
anyone who testifies that he conducted a diligent search of the
relevant  records  can  testify  to  the  absence  of  the  record  in
question.)

(B)  is  wrong,  because  the  witness  was  testifying  about  only
the absence of a single record, not the contents of voluminous
records.  FRE  1006,  entitled  “Summaries  to  prove  content,”
says  that  “The  proponent  may  use  a  summary,  chart,  or
calculation  to  prove  the  content  of  voluminous  writings,
recordings,  or  photographs  that  cannot  be  conveniently
examined  in  court.”  Here,  however,  while  the  records  the
witness  searched  might  be  voluminous,  the  subject  of  his
search was a single record, which he didn’t find. The witness
was  therefore  not  summarizing  “the  content  of  voluminous
writings.”

(C)  is  wrong,  because  there  is  a  hearsay  exception  for  the
absence  of  official  records.  As  described  in  the  analysis  of
choice A above, FRE 803(10) gives a hearsay exception for
the absence of an official record. Consequently, the testimony
here is not hearsay.
(D)  is  wrong,  because  testimony  about  the  absence  of  an
official record receives a hearsay exception, and the records
containing the omission need not be produced. FRE 803(10),
allowing  testimony  that  a  particular  official  record  was  not
found after diligent search, does not include any requirement
that the records that were searched be produced.

It’s  true  that  apart  from  hearsay  issues,  when  the  affirmative
contents  of  a  document  are  offered  the  document  itself  must
normally be offered under the Best Evidence Rule (the FRE’s
general  formulation  of  which  occurs  in  Rule  1002).  But  the
BER  is  not  deemed  applicable  to  the  “absence  of  a  record”
situation — testimony that a diligent search has not turned up
the  record  is  all  that  is  required,  and  the  mass  of  searched
records need not be produced.

VI.  DECLARATIONS AGAINST INTEREST

A.  Generally

504

1.  Text of Federal Rule

Question 35:  The  defendant,  a  man,  has  been  charged  with
murdering  the  victim.  The  defendant  defends  on  the  grounds
that the murder was really committed by a particular woman,
who  has  since  died.  The  defendant  offers  a  properly
authenticated  photocopy  of  a  transcript  of  a  deposition  in  a
civil suit brought against the woman by the victim’s family for
the  victim’s  death,  in  which  the  woman  said,  “Yes,  I  killed
him because I hated him.” The civil suit was brought because
the  woman  was  known  to  have  quarreled  with  and  disliked
the  victim.  Upon  proper  objection  by  the  prosecution,  the
statement should be

(A) admitted as a declaration against interest.
(B) 

  admitted  as  former  testimony  by  a  person  now
unavailable.

(C)  inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
(D) 

  inadmissible,  because  the  original  rather  than  a
photocopy must be offered.

Answer 35: Choice (A) is correct. First, this is hearsay: The
declarant’s statement “I killed him” is being offered to show
that  she  did  indeed  kill  him.  But  FRE  804(b)(3)  (one  of  the
declarant-unavailable  exceptions)  gives  a  hearsay  exception
for  a  statement  by  a  now-  unavailable  witness  which  “when
made,  .  .  .  was  so  contrary  to  the  declarant’s  proprietary  or
pecuniary interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the
declarant’s  claim  against  someone  else  or  to  expose  the
declarant  to  civil  or  criminal  liability”  that  “a  reasonable
person  in  the  declarant’s  position  would  have  made  [the
statement] only if the person believed it to be true[.]” Where,
as here, the statement is “offered in a criminal case as one that
tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability,” 804(b)(3)
(B)  adds  the  further  requirement  that  the  statement  be
“supported  by  corroborating  circumstances 
that  clearly
indicate  its  trustworthiness.”  Here,  the  fact  that  the  woman
was  known  to  have  quarreled  with  and  disliked  the  victim,
and  the  fact  that  the  victim’s  family  chose  to  bring  civil  suit
the  required  corroborating
against 
circumstances to indicate the statement’s trustworthiness.

the  woman,  supply 

505

(B)  is  wrong  because,  although  there  is  indeed  an  exception
for  former  testimony  given  under  oath  at  a  trial  or  other
proceeding,  the  exception  applies  only  if  the  testimony  is
“now  offered  against  a  party  who  had — or,  in  a  civil  case,
whose  predecessor  in  interest  had — an  opportunity  and
similar  motive  to  develop  it  by  direct,  cross-,  or  redirect
examination.” See FRE 804(b)(1)(B). Since the party against
whom the testimony is now being offered is the government,
the  statement  could  qualify  only  if  the  government  had  the
opportunity and similar motive to “develop” (i.e., undermine)
the  woman’s  testimony  in  the  earlier  civil  suit;  because  the
prosecution  was  not  part  of  that  suit,  this  requirement  is  not
satisfied.

(C) is wrong because, while the statement is indeed hearsay,
as
the  declaration-against-interest 
described in Choice (A) above.

exception 

applies, 

(D) is wrong because, although the Best Evidence Rule does
indeed sometimes require an original, FRE 1003 says that “a
duplicate  is  admissible  to  the  same  extent  as  the  original
unless  a  genuine  question  is  raised  about  the  original’s
authenticity  or  the  circumstances  make  it  unfair  to  admit  the
duplicate.” There is no indication on these facts that either of
these problems is present.

Question 36: Pamela sued Driver for damages for the death
of  Pamela’s  husband  Ronald,  resulting  from  an  automobile
collision that had occurred a week before the death. At trial,
Driver calls Ronald’s doctor to testify that the day before his
death,  Ronald,  in  great  pain,  said,  “It  was  my  own  fault;
there’s nobody to blame but me.”
The doctor’s testimony should be admitted as
(A)  a statement against interest.
(B)  a dying declaration.
(C)  a statement of Ronald’s then existing state of mind.
(D)  an excited utterance.
Answer  36:  Choice  (A) 
three
requirements for the declaration-against-interest exception to
the hearsay rule: (1) the declarant must be unavailable; (2) the
declaration must have been against the declarant’s pecuniary

is  correct.  There  are 

506

or proprietary interest when made; and (3) the circumstances
must be such that declarant would not have made the statement
unless he believed it to be true. All of these requirements are
fulfilled  regarding  the  statement  made  by  the  now-deceased
Ronald:  (1)  he’s  dead  and  thus  unavailable;  (2)  he  exposed
himself  to  tort  liability  by  acknowledging  responsibility  for
the  accident;  and  (3)  there  is  no  apparent  reason  why  he’d
acknowledge responsibility if he didn’t think he was in fact at
fault.

(B) is wrong, because the dying declaration exception applies
only  where  the  declarant  believes  that  his  own  death  is
imminent. See FRE 804(b)(2). The statement here was made
by Ronald the day before he died, and there is no indication
that  at  the  time,  Ronald  believed  that  his  death  was
“imminent.”

(C)  is  wrong,  because  of  the  timing  element.  FRE  803(3)
gives a hearsay exception for “A statement of the declarant’s
then-existing state of mind,” but says that the exception does
not apply to “a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact
remembered  or  believed  unless  it  relates  to  the  validity  or
terms of the declarant’s will.” Here, Ronald’s statement is a
statement  about  a  fact  remembered  or  believed  (that  the
accident,  which  had  happened  nearly  a  week  before,  was
caused  by  Ronald’s  own  fault),  so  the  exception  doesn’t
apply.

(D)  is  wrong  because  FRE  803(2)’s  excited  utterance
exception  applies  only  to  “a  statement  relating  to  a  startling
event or condition, made while the declarant was under the
stress  of  excitement  that  it  caused.”  There  is  no  evidence
that  Ronald,  at  the  time  of  his  visit  to  the  doctor,  was  still
under the stress of excitement from the accident itself, which
had  happened  almost  a  week  before.  The  excited  utterance
exception  is  usually  held  to  apply  only  to  the  immediate
aftermath of the startling event.

PRIVILEGES

I.    THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

A.  Generally

1.  Client

Question  37:  Pace  sues  Def  Company  for  injuries  suffered
when  Pace’s  car  collided  with  Def  Company’s  truck.  Def’s
general  manager  prepared  a  report  of  the  accident  at  the
request of the company’s attorney in preparation for the trial,
and delivered the report to the attorney. Pace demands that the
report be produced.

Will production of the report be required?
(A) 

  Yes,  because  business  reports  are  not  generally
privileged.

(B)    No,  because  it  is  privileged  communication  from  the

client to the attorney.

the  scope  of 

(C)  No, because such reports contain hearsay.
(D)  No, because such reports are self-serving.
Answer  37:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  A  communication  is
subject  to  attorney-client  privilege  if  it  is  a  communication
from the client to the attorney, made in confidence, concerning
legal  representation.  A  corporation  is  subject  to  the  same
privilege as an individual, and the general manager would be
the  modern
within 
“performance  of  duties”  test,  under  which  the  privilege
extends to any employee’s communication if it was within his
duties, and it was offered to advance the legal interests of the
corporation.  So  the  communication  here  is  within  the
attorney-client  privilege.  A  companion  “work  product
immunity,” in force as a matter of common-law in nearly all
jurisdictions,  gives  an  immunity  from  discovery  or  other
“production” for materials that would be inadmissible at trial
due to the attorney-client privilege.
(A)  is  not  the  best  response  because  it  does  not  correctly

the  privilege  under 

508

characterize the facts and law. A communication of any kind,
business report or not, is subject to attorney-client privilege if
it is a communication from the client to the attorney, made in
confidence, concerning legal representation. Here, the report
fits  this  description — the  general  manager  made  the  report
about  the  accident,  intended  that  it  be  read  only  by  the
attorney, and it was made in preparation for trial. And apart
from  admissibility  at  trial,  the  “work  product  immunity”  for
direct client-attorney communication prevents the client (Def
Co.) from having to produce it in discovery.

(C) is not the best response because (1) it ignores the central
reason the report will be non- producible — it is covered by
the  work-product  immunity;  and  (2)  it  falsely  asserts  that
because the report is or might be inadmissible, it need not be
produced. As to (1), what makes the report non-producible is
the  attorney-client  privilege  and  companion  “work  product
immunity,”  not  the  presence  of  hearsay.  As  to  (2),  even
materials  that  would  not  be  admissible  at  trial  because  they
contain  hearsay  are  producible  in  discovery,  if  they  are
reasonably likely to lead to discoverable evidence. (And it’s
not so clear that the report wouldn’t be admissible if it were
not  for  the  attorney-client  work-product  immunity  problem;
for  instance,  the  report  and  the  statements  in  it  might  all  be
admissible as non-hearsay admissions by a party-opponent or
its agents.)

information  [or] 

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  self-serving  nature  of  the  report
won’t prevent the opposite party (the adversary of the report’s
author) from offering it. If Def Co. were offering the report as
a business record under FRE 803(6), the fact that the “source
of 
the  method  or  circumstances  of
preparation  indicate  a  lack  of  trustworthiness”  (803(6)(E))
would be fatal. But where the adversary of the preparer of the
record or report is offering it against the preparer, the report
can come in as an admission, and the document’s self-serving
nature won’t matter.

B.  Professional relationship

1.  Fee arrangements not covered by privilege

Question 38:  A  defendant  was  on  trial  for  tax  evasion.  The

509

IRS, seeking to establish the defendant’s income by showing
his  expenditures,  called  on  the  defendant’s  attorney  to
produce  records  showing  only  how  much  the  defendant  had
paid his attorney in fees.

Should the demand for the attorney’s fee records be upheld?

(A)  Yes, because it calls for relevant information not within

the attorney-client privilege.

(B)    Yes,  because  the  attorney-client  privilege  cannot  be

invoked to conceal evidence of a crime.

(C)    No,  because  the  records  are  protected  by  the  attorney-

client privilege.

(D)    No,  because  the  records  are  protected  by  the  attorney

work-product doctrine.

Answer  38:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  attorney-client
privilege  applies  only  to  confidential  communications  made
for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  legal  representation  of  the
client.  Courts  have  uniformly  held  that  the  details  of  fee
arrangements,  including  the  amount  paid  by  the  defendant  in
fees,  are  not  communications  made  for  the  purpose  of
facilitating  representation,  and  are  therefore  not  covered  by
the privilege. See M&K, § 5.19, p. 356.

(B) is wrong because it gives an incorrect explanation of the
correct outcome. The attorney-client privilege can be invoked
even  where  it  conceals  evidence  of  a  past  crime.  (The
examiners are trying to make you think of the “crime or fraud”
exception,  by  which  communications  are  not  covered  by  the
privilege if they are made for the purpose of accomplishing or
concealing a future crime or fraud.)

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  attorney-client  privilege  applies
only to confidential communications made for the purpose of
facilitating  legal  representation  of  the  client.  The  amount  the
defendant  paid  in  legal  fees  does  not  qualify  as  such  a
communication, as is described in the analysis of Choice (A).
(D)  is  wrong  because  the  work-product  doctrine  provides  a
qualified  immunity  for  only  those  materials  prepared  by  an
attorney or client in anticipation of litigation, such as witness
statements, 
trial  memoranda.
Documents showing the amount a client has paid or will pay

investigative 

reports,  or 

510

to  his  attorney  for  legal  representation  are  not  deemed  to  be
prepared “in anticipation of litigation,” so they are outside the
protection of the work-product doctrine.

II.   THE PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-

INCRIMINATION

A.  Negative inference allowed in civil cases

Question  39:  A  plaintiff  sued  an  individual  defendant  for
injuries suffered in a collision between the plaintiff’s car and
the  defendant’s  truck  while  the  defendant’s  employee  was
driving  the  truck.  The  plaintiff  sought  discovery  of  any
accident  report  the  employee  might  have  made  to  the
defendant,  but  the  defendant  responded  that  no  such  report
existed.  Before  trial,  the  defendant  moved  to  preclude  the
plaintiff from asking the defendant in the presence of the jury
whether  he  destroyed  such  a  report,  because  the  defendant
would then invoke his privilege against self-incrimination.
Should the court allow the plaintiff to ask the defendant about
the destruction of the report?

(A)   No, because a report that was prepared in anticipation of

litigation is not subject to discovery.

(B)    No,  because  no  inference  may  properly  be  drawn  from

invocation of a legitimate privilege.

(C)  Yes, because a party in a civil action may not invoke the

privilege against self-incrimination.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  defendant’s  destruction  of  the  report
would serve as the basis of an inference adverse to the
defendant.

Answer  39:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  If  a  party  destroys
evidence, it is proper for the jury to draw an inference that the
evidence was adverse to that party. It’s true that the Supreme
Court  has  held  that  in  a  criminal case,  neither  the  judge  nor
the prosecution can encourage a jury to draw an inference of
guilt  from  a  defendant’s  invocation  of  her  privilege  against
self-incrimination;  Griffin  v.  California  (1965).  But  it’s
proper  for  the  jury  to  draw  an  adverse  inference  in  a  civil
case  from  a  party’s  assertion  of  the  privilege  against  self-

511

incrimination. Thus, the court should allow the question to be
asked,  because  it  is  proper  regardless  of  how  the  defendant
responds.

(A) is wrong because although it is true that a report prepared
in anticipation of litigation may qualify as work product, the
work-product  immunity  is  not  absolute.  Documents  that  are
work product are still subject to discovery upon a showing of
substantial  need  and  the  inability  to  obtain  the  substantial
equivalent of the materials by other means. Moreover, a claim
of work-product immunity must be asserted before, and ruled
on by, the court — a party cannot simply destroy the material
and claim work-product protection. Finally, here the plaintiff
would  not  be  asking  the  defendant  to  produce  the  report  for
the  jury  to  see;  the  plaintiff  would  only  ask  whether  such  a
report had been destroyed.

(B)  is  wrong  because  although  the  Supreme  Court  has  held
that neither the judge nor the prosecution can encourage a jury
to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant’s invocation of
her  privilege  against  self-incrimination  in  a  criminal  case,
Griffin v. California (1965), it is proper for the jury to draw
an adverse inference in a civil case from a party’s assertion of
the privilege against self-incrimination.
(C) is wrong because the privilege against self-incrimination
may be asserted in both civil and criminal cases.

CHAPTER 7
REAL AND DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE,
INCLUDING WRITINGS

I.    AUTHENTICATION

A.  Authentication of writings and recordings

1.  Signature or handwriting

a.  Non-expert

Question  40:  When  a  man  entered  a  bank  and  presented  a
check for payment, the bank teller recognized the signature on
the  check  as  a  forgery  because  the  check  was  drawn  on  the
account of a customer whose handwriting she knew. The bank
teller  called  the  police.  Before  the  police  arrived,  the  man
picked up the check from the counter and left.
The man was charged with attempting to cash a forged check.
At trial, the prosecutor called the bank teller to testify that the
signature on the check was forged.

Is the bank teller’s testimony admissible?

(A)  Yes, because a bank teller is by occupation an expert on

handwriting.

(B)    Yes,  because  it  is  rationally  based  on  the  bank  teller’s

perception and is helpful to the jury.

(C)  No, because the bank teller was at fault in allowing loss

of the original by failing to secure the check.

(D)    No,  because  it  is  not  possible  for  either  the  jury  or  an
expert  to  compare  the  signature  on  the  missing  check
with a signature established as genuine.

Answer 40:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  witness  teller,  who
has not been qualified as a handwriting expert, is offering her
lay opinion as to the genuineness of the signature on the check.
FRE  701  allows  lay  opinion  testimony  in  general  when  it  is
“rationally based on the witness’s perception” and is “helpful
to  clearly  understanding  the  witness’s  testimony  or  to
determining  a  fact  in  issue[.]”  These  requirements  are  met

513

that 

the
here.  Additionally,  FRE  901(b)(2)  provides 
authenticity  of  a  document  can  be  established  by  “a
nonexpert’s  opinion  that  handwriting  is  genuine,  based  on  a
familiarity  with  it  that  was  not  acquired  for  the  current
litigation.” This requirement is met here, since the facts tell us
that  the  witness/teller  already,  at  the  time  of  the  episode,
knew the signature of the bank customer on whose account the
check was drawn. This knowledge made it possible for her to
recognize the signature on the check as a forgery, and to testify
with  first-hand  knowlege  that  the  signature  on  the  check
presented was different from the signature of the owner of the
account. Thus, the testimony is permitted.

(A)  is  wrong  because  there  is  nothing  in  the  fact  pattern  to
suggest  that  the  bank  teller  is  an  expert  on  handwriting — 
merely working as a bank teller would not give a person such
expertise.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  application  of  the
original  document  rule.  This  choice  is  premised  on  a
plausible  idea:  that  because  what’s  being  proved  is  the
contents  of  a  writing  (namely,  the  signature  on  a  check),  the
original  of  that  writing  must  be  produced.  FRE  1002’s
implementation of the original documents rule (a/k/a the Best
Evidence  Rule)  indeed  says  that  “An  original  writing,
recording,  or  photograph  is  required  in  order  to  prove  its
content  unless  these  rules  or  a  federal  statute  provides
otherwise.” So if the original of the check had been available
to  the  prosecution,  the  prosecution’s  failure  to  present  that
original,  and  to  have  the  teller  testify  about  the  check’s
contents instead, would indeed have been a violation of FRE
1002.  But  FRE  1004(a)  grants  an  exception  to  the  original
documents rule where “all the originals are lost or destroyed,
and not by the proponent acting in bad faith[.]” The proponent
here  is  the  prosecution  (not  the  bank  teller),  so  even  if  the
teller had acted in bad faith in not securing the check, the FRE
1004(a) exception would still have applied. In any event, on
the facts here, there is no evidence that the teller behaved in
bad  faith  (or  was  even  at  fault)  by  not  securing  the  check
before the defendant could grab it and run away with it.
(D)  is  wrong  because  having  an  expert  (or  even  the  jury

514

members  themselves)  compare  an  exemplar  established  as
genuine  with  the  disputed  signature  is  not  the  only  way  to
establish  whether  a  signature  is  forged  or  authentic.  It’s  true
that FRE 901(b)(3) permits authentication of a document via
“a  comparison  with  an  authenticated  specimen  by  an  expert
witness  or  the  trier  of  fact.”  However,  this  is  not  the  only
method  authorized  by  FRE  901.  FRE  901(b)(2)  permits
authentication  by  “a  nonexpert’s  opinion  that  handwriting  is
genuine, based on a familiarity with it that was not acquired
for  the  current  litigation.”  The  testimony  here  satisfies  that
method,  since  the  teller  got  her  familiarity  with  the  real
account-holder’s  signature  in  a  way  that  pre-dated  the
litigation.

b.  Exemplars

Question 41: Parker sues Dix for breach of a promise made
in  a  letter  allegedly  written  by  Dix  to  Parker.  Dix  denies
writing the letter.

Which of the following would NOT be a sufficient basis for
admitting the letter into evidence?

(A)    Testimony  by  Parker  that  she  is  familiar  with  Dix’s

signature and recognizes it on the letter.

(B)    Comparison  by  the  trier  of  fact  of  the  letter  with  an

admitted signature of Dix.

(C)    Opinion  testimony  of  a  nonexpert  witness  based  upon
the

to  authenticate 

in  order 

familiarity  acquired 
signature.

(D)    Evidence  that  the  letter  was  written  in  response  to  one

written by Parker to Dix.

Answer 41: Choice (C) is correct (i.e., the choice is not an
acceptable  method  of  authentication).  FRE  901(b)(2)  allows
authentication  by  “a  nonexpert’s  opinion  that  handwriting  is
genuine, based on a familiarity with it that was not acquired
for  the  current  litigation.”  The  fact  pattern  indicates  that  the
nonexpert  acquired  familiarity  in  order  to  authenticate  the
signature; therefore, this would not serve as a sufficient basis
for admitting the letter into evidence.

(A)  is  wrong  because  a  nonexpert  who  is  already  familiar
with a signature may testify as to its genuineness as provided

515

by FRE 901(b)(2) and discussed in the explanation to (C). It
is irrelevant that the nonexpert is a party to the litigation.

(B) is wrong because handwriting may be authenticated by the
use of exemplars, in which case it is up to the jury to compare
the  exemplar  with  the  offered  writing  to  determine  its
genuineness.

(D) is wrong, because evidence that the letter (relying on its
contents  and  other  circumstances)  was  written  as  a  reply  to
one already authenticated is a method of authentication falling
under the category of “distinctive characteristics of the item,
taken together with all the circumstances.” FRE 901(b)(4).

2.  Phone conversation

a.  Incoming calls

Question  42:  In  a  narcotics  conspiracy  prosecution  against
Daly, the prosecutor offers in evidence a tape recording of a
telephone  call  allegedly  made  by  Daly.  A  lay  witness  is
called to testify that the voice on the recording is Daly’s. Her
testimony  to  which  of  the  following  would  be  the  LEAST
sufficient basis for admitting the recording?

(A)  She had heard the same voice on a similar tape recording

identified to her by Daly’s brother.

(B)  She had heard Daly speak many times, but never over the

telephone.

(C)    She  had,  specifically  for  the  purpose  of  preparing  to
testify,  talked  with  Daly  over  the  telephone  at  a  time
after the recording was made.

(D)  She had been present with Daly when he engaged in the
conversation in question but had heard only Daly’s side
of the conversation.

Answer 42: Choice (A)  is  the  best  response,  because  under
this  alternative,  the  lay  witness  is  not  personally  familiar
with  Daly’s  voice,  and  thus  the  recording  wouldn’t  be
admissible with this testimony alone. The rule is that a voice
can  be  authenticated  by  any  person  who  recognizes  it.  FRE
901(b)(5)  allows  authentication  by  means  of  “an  opinion
identifying  a  person’s  voice — whether  heard  firsthand  or
through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording 

516

— based on hearing the voice at any time under circumstances
that connect it with the alleged speaker.” Here, the only thing
linking  the  lay  witness  and  Daly’s  voice  is  an  assurance  by
Daly’s brother that a recorded voice was Daly’s; the witness
herself  has  no  personal  familiarity  with  it.  (Thus,  if  Daly’s
brother  were  lying  or  mistaken,  the  lay  witness’s  testimony
would  be  useless.)  Since  (A)  states  the  only  basis  on  which
the  lay  witness  couldn’t  authenticate  the  tape,  of  these  four
choices, it’s the best response.

(B) is wrong because the fact that the witness had never heard
Daly  speak  over  the  telephone  would  be  irrelevant.  FRE
901(b)(5)  allows  authentication  by  means  of  “an  opinion
identifying  a  person’s  voice — whether  heard  firsthand  or
through  mechanical  or  electronic  transmission  or  recording 
— based on hearing the voice at any time under circumstances
that connect it with the alleged speaker.” Here, the lay witness
satisfies  this  requirement  because  she  had  heard  the  voice
many  times.  The  rule  doesn’t  require  that  the  witness  be
familiar  with  the  voice  in  the  form  in  which  it  must  be
authenticated (here, a tape recording).

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  lay  witness  could  authenticate  the
recording  on  this  basis,  since  any  person  who  recognizes  a
voice can authenticate it. FRE 901(b)(5) (quoted in full in (A)
above)  allows  lay  testimony  identifying  a  voice  based  upon
“hearing  the  voice  at  any  time  under  circumstances  that
connect it with the alleged speaker.” This language means that
familiarity  acquired  in  anticipation  of  litigation  does  not
disqualify  the  witness.  (This  makes  the  situation  different
from handwriting, as to which 901(b)(2) allows lay testimony
only  if  “based  on  a  familiarity  with  it  that  was  not  acquired
for the current litigation.”)
(D) is wrong because it represents possibly the best basis on
which  the  lay  witness  could  authenticate  the  recording.  Not
only  would  she  be  able  to  recognize  the  voice,  but  she’d  be
familiar  with  the  very  conversation  that  was  recorded.
Nothing  in  901(b)(5)  would  come  close  to  ruling  out  an
identification  of  the  speaker  on  a  tape  as  having  been  the
person  whose  side  of  the  taped  conversation  the  witness
heard in person.

517

II.   THE “BEST EVIDENCE” RULE FOR
RECORDED COMMUNICATIONS

A.  Communications covered

1.  Other “real” evidence not covered

Question 43: Poole sued Darrel for unlawfully using Poole’s
idea  for  an  animal  robot  as  a  character  in  Darrel’s  science
fiction  movie.  Darrel  admitted  that  he  had  received  a  model
of an animal robot from Poole, but he denied that it had any
substantial similarity to the movie character. After the model
had been returned to Poole, Poole destroyed it.

In  order  for  Poole  to  testify  to  the  appearance  of  the  model,
Poole

(A)  must show that he did not destroy the model in bad faith.
(B)    must  give  advance  notice  of  his  intent  to  introduce  the

oral testimony.

(C)  must introduce a photograph of the model if one exists.
(D)    need  do  none  of  the  above,  because  the  “best  evidence
recordings,  and

to  writings, 

rule”  applies  only 
photographs.

Answer 43: Choice (D) is correct. Under FRE 1002, the Best
Evidence  Rule  applies  only  to  writings  recordings,  and
photographs.

Since  the  Best  Evidence  Rule  doesn’t  apply  to  models,  the
original model need not be produced, and Poole may testify to
its  appearance  without  adhering  to  any  of  the  requirements
laid out in Choices (A), (B), and (C).

Question  44:  A  plaintiff  sued  a  defendant  for  injuries
suffered in a car accident allegedly caused by brakes that had
been  negligently  repaired  by  the  defendant.  At  a  settlement
conference, the plaintiff exhibited the brake shoe that caused
the  accident  and  pointed  out  the  alleged  defect  to  an  expert,
whom  the  defendant  had  brought  to  the  conference.  No
settlement  was  reached.  At  trial,  the  brake  shoe  having
disappeared,  the  plaintiff  seeks  to  testify  concerning  the
condition of the shoe.
The plaintiff’s testimony is

518

(A)  admissible, because the defendant’s expert had been able

to examine the shoe carefully.

(B)  admissible, because the plaintiff had personal knowledge

of the shoe’s condition.

(C)  inadmissible, because the brake shoe was produced and

examined as a part of settlement negotiations.

(D)    inadmissible,  unless  the  plaintiff  establishes  that  the

disappearance was not his fault.

Answer  44:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Where  a  witness  has
personal  knowledge  about  a  fact,  the  witness  is  ordinarily
entitled  to  testify  about  that  fact.  Here,  the  plaintiff  has
personal  knowledge  about  the  condition  of  the  shoe,  and  is
therefore  entitled  to  testify  about  that  condition,  unless  some
other  rule  blocks  the  testimony.  There  is  no  such  other  rule
that applies here.

(A) is wrong because the fact that the defendant’s expert was
able  to  examine  the  shoe  carefully  is  irrelevant.  Even  if  the
defendant’s expert had not been able to examine the shoe, the
plaintiff  would  still  have  been  permitted  to  testify  about  his
personal knowledge of the condition.

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  a  physical  object  was
present  during  settlement  negotiations  does  not  mean  that
testimony about the object’s condition becomes inadmissible.
It  is  true  that  FRE  408(a)  makes  inadmissible  settlement
offers,  as  well  as  “conduct  or  a  statement  made  during”
settlement  negotiations,  if  offered  to  “prove  or  disprove  the
validity  or  amount  of  a  disputed  claim.”  But  FRE  408(b)
carefully  states  that  the  court  may  admit  such  settlement-
related  conduct  or  statements  “for  another  purpose”  than
proving  or  disproving  the  validity  or  amount  of  the  disputed
claim.  The  fact  that  the  plaintiff  displayed  the  shoe  during  a
settlement  conference  doesn’t  mean 
the  plaintiff’s
testimony  about  the  shoe’s  condition  is  being  offered  to
“prove  or  disprove  the  validity  or  amount  of  a  disputed
claim”  as  prohibited  by  408(a);  therefore,  it’s  408(b)  that
controls, to make 408’s ban on settlement-related conduct or
statements inapplicable.
(D) is wrong because the plaintiff does not bear the burden of

that 

519

establishing  that  the  disappearance  was  not  his  fault.  If  the
item had been a document, and its “contents” were sought to
be  proved,  the  FRE’s  implementation  of  the  Best  Evidence
Rule would mean that the fact that the person seeking to testify
about  the  contents  was  responsible  in  bad  faith  for  the
document’s  disappearance  would  cause  the  testimony  to  be
excluded.  (See  FRE  1004:  “An  original  is  not  required,  and
other evidence of the contents of a writing . . . is admissible if
(a)  all  the  originals  are  lost  or  destroyed,  and  not  by  the
proponent acting in bad faith[.]”) But no such rule applies to
items of physical evidence that are not writings, recordings,
or photographs (i.e., to items that are not subject to the Best
Evidence Rule). The court probably has discretion to exclude
testimony  about  an 
real  evidence  whose
item  of 
disappearance has been shown to have been procured by the
intentional wrongdoing of the proponent of the testimony. But
even so, it certainly is not the case that the burden would be
placed  on  the  party  who  will  be  testifying  to  make  an
affirmative showing that that party was not responsible for the
disappearance.

B.  Proving the contents

to  answer  questions, 

Question  45:  A  defendant  was  charged  with  burglary.  At
trial,  a  police  officer  testified  that,  after  the  defendant  was
arrested  and  agreed 
the  officer
interrogated  him  with  a  stenographer  present,  but  that  the
officer could not now recall what the defendant had said. The
prosecutor  presented  the  officer  with  a  photocopy  of  the
stenographic transcript of the interrogation. The officer, after
looking at it, was prepared to testify that he recalled that the
defendant  admitted  to  being  in  the  area  of  the  burglary.  The
defendant  objected  to  the  officer’s  testimony  on  the  ground
that  it  violated  the  “original  document”  rule  (also  known  as
the “best evidence” rule).
Should  the  officer’s  testimony  concerning  the  defendant’s
recorded confession be admitted?
(A)    No,  because  a  photocopy  cannot  be  used  without  a

showing that the original is unavailable.

(B)    No,  because  the  stenographer  has  not  testified  to  the

520

accuracy of the transcript.

(C)  Yes, because a photocopy is a duplicate of the original.
(D)  Yes, because the prosecutor is not attempting to prove the

contents of the document.

Answer 45: Choice (D) is correct. The prosecutor is trying to
prove  what  the  defendant  said,  not  what  the  transcript  says.
Accordingly,  FRE  1003,  the  Best  Evidence  Rule,  is  not
relevant.  (It  would  be  different,  for  example,  if  this  was  a
contract and the parties differed over the wording of a clause
in the contract — then the BER would apply.) In this case, the
copy  of  the  transcript  is  properly  used  under  FRE  612  to
revive the officer’s recollection.

Notice, by the way, that neither this choice nor any part of the
question  uses  the  phrase  “present  recollection  refreshed,”
even though that’s the doctrine that controls the outcome. It’s
up  to  you  to  recognize  that  refreshment  of  recollection  is
what’s  occurring,  and  that  it’s  being  done  properly  here.
Under the doctrine of present recollection refreshed, any item
may  be  used  to  refresh  the  witness’s  memory,  including
leading  questions,  documents,  or  objects.  If  the  witness,
having seen the refreshing object, can testify from memory, the
item  will  not  be  considered  evidence.  See  FRE  612,
refreshed
the  present 
implicitly  allowing 
technique,  subject  to  certain  limitations  (which  don’t  affect
the  outcome  here).  Here,  the  officer  is  going  to  testify  (from
his  memory,  after  refreshing  it  from  the  transcript)  to  his
recollection  that  the  defendant  admitted  being  nearby,  so  the
recollection-refreshed doctrine applies.

recollection 

(A) is wrong because the prosecutor is trying to prove what
the defendant said, not what the transcript says. Accordingly,
the  Best  Evidence  Rule  is  not  relevant.  By  the  way,  even
assuming  that  the  BER  applied  here,  this  choice  is  not  an
accurate  statement  of  the  law.  Under  FRE  1003,  a  duplicate
can  be  admissible  without  any  showing  that  the  original  is
unavailable.  A  showing  of  unavailability  is  required  only  if
the  party  is  seeking  to  introduce  something  other  than  a
duplicate  (e.g.,  oral  testimony)  to  prove  the  contents  of  a
document. See FRE 1004.
(B)  is  wrong  because  this  is  not  a  case  of  past  recollection

521

recorded; if it were, the prosecutor would have to show that
the stenographer accurately recorded what the defendant said.
In  this  case,  the  officer  is  testifying  to  his  own  (present)
recollection  of  what  the  defendant  said,  that  recollection
having  been  revived  by  looking  at  the  transcript.  Therefore,
the relevant doctrine is “present recollection refreshed.” That
doctrine  is  embodied  in  FRE  612,  under  which  a  document
used  only  to  refresh  the  recollection  of  the  witness  does  not
have to be accurate or reliable, because the document is not
being  admitted  into  evidence.  So  here,  the  copy  of  the
transcript  is  being  properly  used  to  refresh  the  officer’s
recollection, and the officer’s testimony is the evidence.

(C)  is  wrong  because,  although  FRE  1003  supports  the
admission  of  photocopies  with  some  exceptions,  this  option
assumes  that  the  Best  Evidence  Rule  applies  here,  which  it
doesn’t. The prosecutor is trying to prove what the defendant
said, not what the transcript says. The transcript here is being
used to refresh the officer’s recollection under Federal Rule
of Evidence 612, so Rule 1003 (the FRE’s version of the Best
Evidence Rule) is not relevant.

III.  SUMMARIES OF VOLUMINOUS WRITINGS

A.  Summaries generally

Question 46: A lawyer worked steadily on a case for a client
over  a  five-year  period,  with  the  billing  agreed  to  be  on
particular  amount  charge  per  hour  worked.  The  lawyer  kept
regular timesheets showing, for any day on which he worked
on  the  matter,  how  long  he  worked  and  which  of  various
activities  (phone  calls,  letter-writing,  etc.)  he  performed  on
that  day.  In  the  lawyer’s  suit  against  the  client  for  non-
payment,  the  lawyer  did  not  offer  into  evidence  the  actual
timesheets.  Instead,  in  preparation  for  trial,  the  lawyer  used
the  timesheets  to  create  a  summary  showing,  for  each  week,
how much time the lawyer spent on each of the activity types.
Then,  at  trial,  the  lawyer  offered  these  weekly  summaries,
together with his testimony about how he had prepared them.
If  the  client  properly  objects,  the  judge  should  hold  that  the
summaries are

522

(A)    inadmissible  for  any  purpose,  because  the  underlying
timesheets  from  which  they  were  prepared  were  not
offered into evidence.

(B)  inadmissible as substantive evidence, but usable as non-
admitted  materials  to  refresh  the  lawyer’s  present
recollection.

(C)    admissible  as  substantive  evidence  of  hours  worked,  if
the  underlying  timesheets  were  made  available  to  the
client prior to trial.

individual 

(D)  admissible as substantive evidence only if the underlying
timesheets were lost through no fault of the lawyer.
Answer 46: Choice (C) is correct. FRE 1006 says that “The
proponent may use a summary, chart, or calculation to prove
recordings,  or
the  content  of  voluminous  writings, 
photographs  that  cannot  be  conveniently  examined  in  court.”
The 
the  “voluminous
timesheets  here  meet 
writings”  standard,  since  they  would  be  almost  daily  over  a
five-year timeframe, a stack that would be hard for the judge
or  jury  to  examine  in  court.  FRE  1006  also  says  that  “The
proponent must make the originals or duplicates available for
examination  or  copying,  or  both,  by  other  parties  at  a
reasonable  time  and  place.”  So  the  fact  that  the  underlying
timesheets were made available to the client prior to trial, as
specified  in  this  choice,  is  a  necessary  condition  for  the
summaries’  admission  under  FRE  1006.  By  the  way,  the
summaries:  (1)  become  evidence  (i.e.,  they’re  not  just  non-
evidentiary  testimonial  aids);  and  (2)  substitute  for  the
underlying originals, which means that those originals must be
independently admissible. Here, the underlying timesheets are
hearsay,  but  they  fall  within  FRE  803(6)’s  business  records
exception.
(A)  is  wrong  because  the  summary-of-voluminous-writings
provision  of  FRE  1006  applies  as  described  in  Choice  (C)
above, and that provision does not require that the underlying
writings being summarized be offered into evidence (although
they may be).
(B)  is  wrong  because,  under  FRE  1006,  the  summaries  can
come in as substantive evidence, as described in Choice (C)
above.

523

(D) is wrong because the summaries can come in under FRE
1006 even if the underlying timesheets have not been lost. If
you picked this choice, you may be thinking of FRE 1004(1),
under which the BER can be satisfied by something other than
the original writing or a duplicate thereof (e.g., a summary) if
“all the originals are lost or have been destroyed, and not by
the proponent acting in bad faith[.]” But FRE 1006 provides
an independent means of getting summaries into evidence (one
that  does  not  depend  on  loss  of  originals),  and  that  means
1006 is available here as discussed in Choice (C) above.

CHAPTER 8
OPINIONS, EXPERTS, AND SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE

I.    EXPERT WITNESSES

A.  Basis for expert’s opinion

1.  Inadmissible evidence

a.  Proponent and expert can’t disclose

Question 47: Phillips purchased a suit of thermal underwear
manufactured  by  Makorp  from  synthetic  materials.  While  he
was  attempting  to  stamp  out  a  fire,  Phillips’  thermal
underwear  caught  fire  and  burned  in  a  melting  fashion  up  to
his waist. He suffered a heart attack a half hour later. In a suit
against  Makorp,  Phillips  alleged  that  negligence  and  breach
of warranty caused both the burn and the heart attack. Phillips
testified to the foregoing.
Dr. Jones, a physician, having listened to Phillips’ testimony,
is called by Phillips and asked whether, assuming the truth of
such  testimony,  Phillips’  subsequent  heart  attack  could  have
resulted from the burns. His opinion is

(A)  admissible as a response to a hypothetical question.
(B)  admissible because the physician’s expertise enables him

to judge the credibility of Phillips’ testimony.

(C)  inadmissible, because a hypothetical question may not be

based on prior testimony.

(D)    inadmissible,  because  an  expert’s  opinion  may  not  be
based solely on information provided by lay persons.
Answer  47:  Choice  (A)  is  the  best  response  because  it
correctly identifies that the testimony here is admissible as a
response  to  a  hypothetical  question.  Expert  testimony  is
appropriate  where  the  court  determines  that  “the  expert’s
scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help
the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a
fact in issue[.]” FRE 702(a). Here, Dr. Jones’ testimony will
issue — whether  or  not  flaming
address 

the  causation 

525

underwear could cause a heart attack. Dr. Jones’ status as an
expert  entitles  him  to  offer  opinion  evidence  that  would  be
inadmissible  coming  from  a  lay  witness,  and  to  rely  on
information unavailable to a lay witness. The related issue is
whether Dr. Jones may rely on the testimony presented at trial.
The answer is yes: FRE 703 says that “an expert may base an
opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has  been
made aware of or personally observed.” So data supplied at
the  hearing — whether  in  the  form  of  testimony  of  other
witnesses or a hypothetical posed by the questioner (here, it’s
a  combination  of  both) — may  be  the  basis  for  the  expert
opinion, since it’s data that the expert “has been made aware
of.”

(B) is wrong because Jones’s status as a physician wouldn’t
give  him  expert  status  in  determining  credibility.  As  a
threshold  matter,  credibility  itself  is  not  a  “fact,”  and  expert
testimony  is  only  available  to  assist  the  trier  of  fact  to
understand evidence or to determine a fact in issue. FRE 702.
Beyond  that,  a  physician’s  expertise  gives  him  the  ability  to
offer opinion testimony on medical matters; it’s irrelevant to
assessing the credibility of testimony, since one’s status as a
doctor doesn’t make him a better judge of witness credibility
than anyone else.
(C) is wrong because it states an incorrect rule. FRE 703 says
that  “an  expert  may  base  an  opinion  on  facts  or  data  in  the
case  that  the  expert  has  been  made  aware  of  or  personally
observed.”  This  language  allows  the  expert  to  offer  an
opinion  based  on  the  “data”  included  in  a  hypothetical
question.  And  the  hypothetical  question  for  this  purpose  can
be  based  on  prior  trial  testimony  and  on  the  assumption  that
that prior testimony is truthful. (That’s in fact a very common
way for a proponent of expert testimony to proceed.)
(D)  is  wrong  because  it  states  an  incorrect  rule.  An  expert
may  base  his  opinion  on  “facts  or  data  in  the  case  that  the
expert  has  been  made  aware  of.”  FRE  703.  Neither  this  nor
any  other  provision  prevents  the  expert  from  basing  his
opinion solely on information provided by lay persons.

B.  Opinion about defendant’s mental state

526

Question  48:  On  trial  for  murdering  her  husband,  the
defendant  testified  that  she  acted  in  self-defense.  The
defendant  calls  an  expert  psychologist  to  testify  that  under
hypnosis  the  defendant  had  described  the  killing,  and  that  in
the expert’s opinion the defendant had been in fear for her life
at the time of the killing.

Is the expert’s testimony admissible?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  expert  was  able  to  ascertain  that  the

defendant was speaking truthfully.

(B)  Yes, because it reports a prior consistent statement by a
to  examination

(the  defendant) 

subject 

witness 
concerning it.

(C)  No, because reliance on information tainted by hypnosis

is unconstitutional.

(D)    No,  because  it  expresses  an  opinion  concerning  the

defendant’s mental state at the time of the killing.

Answer 48: Choice (D) is correct. FRE 704(b) says that “In a
criminal  case,  an  expert  witness  must  not  state  an  opinion
about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state
or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged
or of a defense. Those matters are for the trier of fact alone.”
The  proposed  testimony  here — that  the  defendant  had  the
mental  state  required  for  a  defense  (the  defense  of  self-
defense) — falls squarely within this prohibition.

(A) is wrong because the statement is not admissible, whether
or  not  the  expert  believed  that  the  defendant  was  speaking
truthfully.  As  described  in  Choice  (D)  above,  FRE  704(b)
bars  the  proposed  testimony.  Additionally,  the  vast  majority
of  courts  have  rejected  the  admission  of  statements  made
under hypnosis. This is true whether the statement is offered
as substantive evidence or for its bearing on the credibility of
the witness’s live testimony at trial.

(B)  is  wrong  because,  as  described  in  Choice  (D),  the
statement  is  expressly  barred  by  FRE  704(b).  If  it  weren’t
barred  by  704(b),  it  might  well  be  admissible  under  FRE
801(d)(1)(B), which defines as non-hearsay, and thus allows,
a  prior  statement  if  “the  declarant  testifies  and  is  subject  to
the
cross-examination  about  [the]  prior  statement,  and 

527

implied  charge” 

statement . . . (B) is consistent with the declarant’s testimony
and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge that the
declarant  recently  fabricated  it  or  acted  from  a  recent
improper influence or motive in so testifying[.]” It’s not clear
from the facts here that the prosecution is making an “express
or 
the  defendant  has  “recently
fabricated” her assertion that she acted in fear for her life, but
if the court were convinced that there was such a charge (and
if the defendant was willing to testify after the expert did and
be cross-examined about the declaration), and if FRE 704(b)
didn’t  intervene,  the  statement  here  would  be  admissible
under 801(d)(1)(B).

that 

(C)  is  wrong  because  use  of  the  hypnosis-induced  out-of-
court  statement  by  the  defendant  would  not  violate  her
constitutional  rights.  If  hypnosis-induced  testimony  were
introduced  against  a  criminal  defendant,  this  usage  might
conceivably  violate  the  defendant’s  criminal  rights.  (If  the
statement  were  induced  from  a  third-party  witness  who  was
not available for cross-examination at trial, for instance, use
of  the  testimony  might  violate  the  defendant’s  Confrontation
Clause  rights.)  But  use  by  a  criminal  defendant  could  never
violate  the  Constitution — whose  rights  would  be  violated?
(The state itself, in the form of the prosecution, does not have
“constitutional rights” vis-à-vis the defendant.)

CHAPTER 9
BURDENS OF PROOF, PRESUMPTIONS,
AND OTHER PROCEDURAL ISSUES

I.    PRESUMPTIONS

A.  Effect of presumptions in federal civil cases

1.  How this works

a.  Instructions to jury

Question 49: In litigation on a federal claim, Plaintiff had the
burden of proving that Defendant received a notice. Plaintiff
relied on the presumption of receipt by offering evidence that
timely notice was addressed to Defendant, properly stamped,
and  mailed.  Defendant,  on  the  other  hand,  testified  that  she
never received the notice.
Which of the following is correct?
(A)  The jury must find that the notice was received.
(B)  The jury may find that the notice was received.
(C)    The  burden  shifts  to  Defendant  to  persuade  the  jury  of

nonreceipt.

(D)    The  jury  must  find  that  the  notice  was  not  received,
because  the  presumption  has  been  rebutted  and  there  is
uncontradicted evidence of nonreceipt.

Answer 49: Choice (B) is correct. Under FRE 301, once the
opponent of the presumption comes up with enough evidence
of  the  presumed  fact’s  non-existence  that  a  jury  could
reasonably  find  that  the  presumed  fact  does  not  exist,  the
presumption disappears from the case in the sense that there is
no effect on the burden of persuasion. When this happens, the
court may instruct the jury that it may infer the existence of the
presumed fact from proof of the basic fact, but the jury is not
required  to  so  infer.  In  this  case,  Defendant’s  testimony,  “I
never got the notice,” is enough to entitle a reasonable jury to
find that the presumed fact (receipt) does not exist. Therefore,
the  presumption  of  receipt  has  disappeared  and  the  plaintiff
still  has  the  burden  of  persuasion  regarding  the  issue  of

529

receipt  of  the  notice.  But  notwithstanding  the  disappearance
of  the  presumption,  the  jury  is  still  entitled  to  conclude  that
notice  was  received  from  proof  of  the  basic  fact  that  notice
was given. Therefore, this choice is accurate in saying that the
jury may infer, but is not required to infer, that the notice was
received.

(A) is wrong because, as noted in the explanation of (B), once
the  presumption  disappears  from  the  case,  the  court  may
instruct the jury that it may infer the existence of the presumed
fact  from  proof  of  the  basic  facts,  but  it  is  not required  that
the jury do so.

(C)  is  wrong  because,  as  explained  in  (B),  the  presumption
has no effect on the burden of persuasion; it “remains on the
party who had it originally” (FRE 301), which, in this case, is
the plaintiff.

(D) is wrong because, as discussed in (B), the jury may infer
the existence of the presumed fact from proof of the basic fact
(i.e., jury may find that the notice was received) even though
the presumption has disappeared from the case.

II.   JUDGE-JURY ALLOCATION

A.  Issues of fact

1.  Technical exclusionary rule

a.  Rules of evidence not binding

to 

letter  from 

Question  50:  In  a  prosecution  of  Drew  for  forgery,  the
defense objects to the testimony of West, a government expert,
on  the  ground  of  inadequate  qualifications.  The  government
the  expert’s  former
seeks 
introduce  a 
is  generally
criminology  professor,  stating 
acknowledged in his field as well qualified.
On  the  issue  of  the  expert’s  qualifications,  the  letter  may  be
considered by
(A)  the jury, without regard to the hearsay rule.
(B)  the judge, without regard to the hearsay rule.
(C)    neither  the  judge  nor  the  jury,  because  it  is  hearsay  not

that  West 

within any exception.

530

(D)    both  the  judge  and  the  jury,  because  the  letter  is  not

offered for a hearsay purpose.

Answer  50:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Questions  of  whether  a
person is qualified to be a witness (whether expert or lay) are
to  be  decided  by  the  judge.  In  doing  so,  the  judge  may  take
into  account  inadmissible  evidence  (except  with  respect  to
privileges). FRE 104(a).

(A), (C), and (D) are wrong because each is inconsistent with
the above explanation.

Question 51: In a prosecution of the defendant for murder, the
government  seeks  to  introduce  a  properly  authenticated  note
written  by  the  victim  that  reads:  “[the  defendant]  did  it.”  In
laying  the  foundation  for  admitting  the  note  as  a  dying
declaration,  the  prosecution  offered  an  affidavit  from  the
attending physician that the victim knew she was about to die
when she wrote the note.
The admissibility of the note as a dying declaration is
(A)    a  preliminary  fact  question  for  the  judge,  and  the  judge

must not consider the affidavit.

(B)    a  preliminary  fact  question  for  the  judge,  and  the  judge

may properly consider the affidavit.

(C)  a question of weight and credibility for the jury, and the

jury must not consider the affidavit.

(D)  a question of weight and credibility for the jury, and the

jury may properly consider the affidavit.

Answer 51: Choice (B) is correct. Both parts of this answer
are true. As to the first part, before a declaration can be found
to  be  an  admissible  “dying  declaration,”  some  preliminary
questions  of  fact  must  be  answered.  In  particular,  it  must  be
determined  whether  the  declarant  was  indeed  aware  of  her
impending death. Under the FRE, the jury decides issues like
this,  of  conditional  relevance,  but  it  is  the  judge  who  makes
the initial decision of admissibility, in determining whether a
reasonable  jury  could  find  that  the  preliminary  fact  exists:
“When  the  relevance  of  evidence  depends  on  whether  a  fact
exists,  proof  must  be  introduced  sufficient  to  support  a
finding that the fact does exist.” FRE 104(b). In other words,
if the judge decides that there is enough evidence that a jury

531

could  reasonably  find  (that’s  what  the  phrase  “sufficient  to
support  a  finding”  means)  that  there  was  an  awareness  of
impending  death,  he  will  let  the  jury  hear  the  declaration,
even  though  he  may  personally  believe  that  it  is  less  likely
than not that there was such awareness.

As  to  the  second  part,  the  judge’s  ability  to  consider  the
affidavit,  FRE  104(a)  says  that  “The  court  must  decide  any
preliminary  question  about  whether  a  witness  is  qualified,  a
privilege exists, or evidence is admissible. In so deciding, the
court  is  not  bound  by  evidence  rules,  except  those  on
privilege.”  The  affidavit  is  relevant  to  the  issue  of  whether
the declarant was aware of her impending death. It’s true that
the affidavit is hearsay (it’s an out-of-court statement offered
to  prove  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted,  i.e.,  that  the  victim
knew or believed she was dying). And this hearsay does not
fall  within  any  exception.  But  under  104(a),  the  judge  may
consider  this  inadmissible  hearsay  to  make  her  preliminary
ruling on the admissibility of the note.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  although  it  correctly  states  that  the
admissibility of the note is a preliminary fact question for the
judge, it incorrectly states that the judge must not consider the
affidavit. As described in the discussion of Choice (B) above,
the judge may consider inadmissible hearsay when resolving
a  preliminary  question  about  the  admissibility  of  other
evidence.

(C) is wrong because, although it is true that the jury must not
consider  the  affidavit,  the  admissibility  of  the  note  is  not  a
question  for  the  jury.  It  will  be  up  to  the  jury  to  determine
what  weight  and  credibility  to  give  the  evidence  of  the  note
once it has been admitted.
(D) is wrong because the jury cannot consider the affidavit (it
is  hearsay)  and  also  because  the  admissibility  of  the  note  is
not  a  question  for  the  jury.  It  will  be  up  to  the  jury  to
determine what weight and credibility to give the evidence of
the note once it has been admitted.

532

CHAPTER 10
JUDICIAL NOTICE

I.    ADJUDICATIVE FACTS

A.  Must take if requested, and may take without a request

1.  Discretionary notice 

Question 52: In state-court contract litigation between Pixley
and  Dill,  a  fact  of  consequence  to  the  determination  of  the
action is whether Pixley provided Dill with a required notice
at Dill’s branch office “in the capital” of the state where the
suit  is  taking  place.  Pixley  introduced  evidence  that  he  gave
notice at Dill’s office in the city of Capitan. Although Capitan
is the state’s capital, Pixley failed to offer proof of that fact.

Which of the following statements is most clearly correct with
respect  to  possible  judicial  notice  of  the  fact  that  Capitan  is
the state’s capital?
(A)    The  court  may  take  judicial  notice  even  though  Pixley

does not request it.

(B)  The court may take judicial notice only if Pixley provides
the  court  with  an  authenticated  copy  of  the  statute  that
designates Capitan as the capital.

(C)  If the court takes judicial notice, the burden of persuasion
on  the  issue  of  whether  Capitan  is  the  capital  shifts  to
Dill.

(D)  If the court takes judicial notice, it should instruct the jury
that  it  may,  but  is  not  required  to,  accept  as  conclusive
the fact that Capitan is the capital.

Answer 52: Choice (A)  is  correct.  First,  the  location  of  the
state capital is a fact that is “generally known within the trial
court’s  territorial  jurisdiction.”  FRE  201(b)(1).  So  the  fact
that  Capitan  is  the  capital  is  appropriate  for  judicial  notice.
Second,  FRE  201(c)(1)  provides  that  a  court  “may  take
judicial notice on its own.” So the court may take notice here
without a request from either party.
(B)  is  wrong  because  judicial  notice  of  an  appropriate  fact

533

may be taken without submission of formal evidence that the
fact is true.

(C)  is  wrong  because,  in  a  civil  case,  once  there  is  judicial
notice,  the  issue  is  decided  and  the  jury  is  not  permitted  to
weigh  the  evidence  in  order  to  come  to  its  own  conclusion.
See FRE 201(f): In a civil case, “the court must instruct the
jury to accept the noticed fact as conclusive.”

(D)  is  wrong  because  in  a  civil  case  the  jury  is  required  to
accept as conclusive the judicially noticed fact, as discussed
in (C).

REAL PROPERTY Q&A BY TOPIC

References to “Rest. 2d” are to the Second Restatement of Property.

CHAPTER 1
ADVERSE POSSESSION

I.    “HOSTILE” POSSESSION

A.  Boundary disputes

Question 1: Twenty-five years ago a seller conveyed Lot 1 to
a  buyer  by  a  warranty  deed.  The  seller  at  that  time  also
executed and delivered an instrument in the proper form of a
deed,  purporting  to  convey  Lot  2  to  the  buyer.  The  seller
thought  she  had  title  to  Lot  2  but  did  not;  therefore,  no  title
passed  by  virtue  of  the  Lot  2  deed.  Lot  2  consisted  of  three
acres of brushland adjoining the west boundary of Lot 1. The
buyer has occasionally hunted rabbits on Lot 2, but less often
than annually. No one else came onto Lot 2 except occasional
rabbit hunters.

Twenty  years  ago,  the  buyer  planted  a  row  of  evergreens  in
the  vicinity  of  the  opposite  (east)  boundary  of  Lot  1  and
erected a fence just beyond the evergreens to the east. In fact
both the trees and the fence were placed on Lot 3, owned by a
neighbor,  which  bordered  the  east  boundary  of  Lot  1.  The
buyer was unsure of the exact boundary, and placed the trees
and the fence in order to establish his rights up to the fence.
The fence is located ten feet within Lot 3.
Now,  the  buyer  has  had  his  property  surveyed  and  the  title
checked and has learned the facts.
The  period  of  time  to  acquire  title  by  adverse  possession  in
the jurisdiction is 15 years.

536

The buyer consulted his lawyer, who properly advised that, in
an  appropriate  action,  the  buyer  would  probably  obtain  title
to

land,  meets 

(A)  Lot 2 but not to the ten-foot strip of Lot 3.
(B)  the ten-foot strip of Lot 3 but not to Lot 2.
(C)  both Lot 2 and the ten-foot strip of Lot 3.
(D)  neither Lot 2 nor the ten-foot strip of Lot 3.
Answer 1: Choice (B) is correct. Courts generally hold that
one who possesses an adjoining landowner’s land, under the
mistaken belief that he has only possessed up to the boundary
the  requirement  of  “hostile”
of  his  own 
possession and can become an owner by adverse possession.
This is especially likely where the possessor has both planted
and fenced in the land in question, since such actions are very
likely to bring home to the record owner that the possessor is
asserting an adverse claim. So the buyer is highly likely to be
found  to  have  gained  title  to  the  10-foot  strip  of  Lot  3  by
adverse possession. On the other hand, the buyer has not met
the  requirement  for  “continuous”  possession  of  Lot  2.  The
requirement  of  “continuous”  position  does  not  mean  that  the
possessor  must  be  physically  on  the  property  100%  of  the
time. However, a court would almost certainly require more
than the very occasional rabbit-hunting at issue here in order
to conclude that the buyer had “continuously” occupied Lot 2.

(A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  they  are  inconsistent
with the above analysis.

II.   CONTINUITY OF POSSESSION

A.  Continuity of possession

1.  Temporary or seasonal gaps in possession

Question 2: Brown owned Blackacre, a tract of undeveloped
land.  Blackacre  abuts  Whiteacre,  a  tract  of  land  owned  by
Agency, 
the  state’s  governmental  energy  agency.  At
Whiteacre,  Agency  has  operated  a  waste-to-electricity
recycling  facility  for  12  years.  Blackacre  and  Whiteacre  are
in a remote area and Whiteacre is the only developed parcel
of  real  estate  within  a  ten-mile  radius.  The  boundary  line

537

between  Blackacre  and  Whiteacre  had  never  been  surveyed
or marked on the face of the earth.

During the past 12 years, some of the trucks bringing waste to
the Agency facility have dumped their loads so that the piles
of waste extend from Whiteacre onto a portion of Blackacre.
However, prior to the four-week period during each calendar
year  when  the  Agency  facility  is  closed  for  inspection  and
repairs, the waste piles are reduced to minimal levels so that
during each of the four-week closures no waste was, in fact,
piled on Blackacre. Neither Brown nor any representative of
Agency knew the facts about the relation of the boundary line
to the waste piles.

The  time  for  acquiring  title  by  adverse  possession  in  the
jurisdiction is ten years.

Last year, Brown died, and his son, Silas, succeeded him as
the  owner  of  Blackacre.  Silas  became  aware  of  the  facts,
demanded that Agency stop using Blackacre for the piling of
waste,  and,  when  Agency  refused  his  demand,  brought  an
appropriate action to enjoin any such use of Blackacre in the
future.
If Agency prevails in that action, it will be because
(A)    the  facts  constitute  adverse  possession  and  title  to  the
portion of Blackacre concerned has vested in Agency.
(B)  Brown’s failure to keep himself informed as to Agency’s
use  of  Blackacre  and  his  failure  to  object  constituted
implied consent to the continuation of that use.

(C)    the  interest  of  the  public  in  the  conversion  of  waste  to
energy  overrides  any  entitlement  of  Silas  to  equitable
remedies.

(D)  the power of eminent domain of the state makes the claim

of Silas moot.

Answer  2:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Agency  will  win  on  an
adverse  possession  claim  if  its  possession  was  open,
notorious, visible, hostile and continuous. The requirement of
hostility  would  likely  be  deemed  satisfied,  because  in  a
boundary dispute an owner who openly occupies the adjacent
parcel  under  the  mistaken  belief  it  is  his  own  is  typically
found  to  meet  the  hostility  requirement.  The  only  other

538

requirement  that  is  seriously  in  issue  here  is  whether
Agency’s  possession  was  “continuous,”  in  the  light  of  the
annual  four-week  period  in  which  there  was  no  trespass.  A
court  would  likely  hold  that  this  brief  respite  each  year  did
not  prevent  the  possession  from  being  continuous,  because
Agency  was  treating  Blackacre  exactly  the  same  way  it
treated its own adjacent portion of Whiteacre — doing annual
cleanup  that  happened  to  have  the  unanticipated  effect  of
removing  the  trespass.  It  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would
conclude that the continuity requirement was met, but adverse
possession is the only one of the choices that would plausibly
yield a victory for Agency.

(B) is wrong because the only way in which Brown could be
found  to  have  given  an  implied  consent  to  Agency’s  use
would be if Brown’s silence was found to have created either
a  license  or  an  easement.  A  license  is  by  its  nature  a
revocable right of use, so even if Brown’s silence had created
a  license  by  implication,  Brown  or  his  successor  would  be
entitled to revoke the license  at  will,  and  Silas’s  suit  would
constitute  such  a  revocation.  As  for  an  easement,  easements
must  generally  satisfy  the  statute  of  frauds.  It  is  true  that  an
easement  by  “estoppel”  can  be  created,  but  this  occurs  only
when the owner of the servient tenement allows a use of his
land while he knew or should have known that the user would
change position in reliance; here there has been no meaningful
reliance by Agency, so this theory would not work.

(C) is wrong because Agency can win only if it obtained legal
title  to  the  part  of  Blackacre  in  question,  and  no  degree  of
“public interest” in waste-conversion could ever give Agency
title to the property by operation of law.
(D)  is  wrong  because  it  concerns  the  wrong  area  of  law.
Agency  is  not  trying  to  obtain  title  to  the  relevant  portion  of
Blackacre  through  eminent  domain  (i.e.,  it  is  not  trying  to
obtain title by paying just compensation). Instead, it is acting
under  “color  of  title”  as  if  it  already  owned  the  portion  of
Blackacre  concerned.  Hence,  the  problem  calls  for  an
adverse possession analysis, not an eminent domain analysis.

FREEHOLD ESTATES

I.    THE FEE SIMPLE

A.  Fee simple defeasible

1.  Determinable

a.  Distinguish from restrictive covenant

Question 3:  A  grantor  executed  an  instrument  in  the  proper
form of a warranty deed purporting to convey a tract of land
to his church. The granting clause of the instrument ran to the
church  “and  its  successors  forever,  so  long  as  the  premises
are used for church purposes.” The church took possession of
the  land  and  used  it  as  its  site  of  worship  for  many  years.
Subsequently, the church wanted to relocate and entered into a
valid  written  contract  to  sell  the  land  to  a  buyer  for  a
substantial price. The buyer wanted to use the land as a site
for business activities and objected to the church’s title. The
contract contained no provision relating to the quality of title
the  church  was  bound  to  convey.  There  is  no  applicable
statute. When the buyer refused to close, the church sued the
buyer  for  specific  performance  and  properly  joined  the
grantor as a party.

Is the church likely to prevail?

(A)    No,  because  the  grantor’s  interest  prevents  the  church’s

title from being marketable.

(B)    No,  because  the  quoted  provision  is  a  valid  restrictive

covenant.

(C)    Yes,  because  a  charitable  trust  to  support  religion  will

attach to the proceeds of the sale.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  grantor  cannot  derogate  from  his

warranty to the church.

Answer  3:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  warranty  deed
conveyed  a  fee  simple  determinable  title  to  the  church,  and
the  grantor  retained  the  future  interest  (a  possibility  of
reverter).  Such  a  reverter  becomes  possessory  immediately

540

upon the occurrence of the limitation. A title is unmarketable
when a reasonable person would not purchase it. This buyer
plans  to  use  the  land  as  a  site  for  business  purposes,  which
would  cause  the  limitation  to  occur  and  the  title  to  be
forfeited  automatically  to  the  grantor.  That  possibility  is
easily enough to render the title unmarketable.

(B) is incorrect. Although this answer correctly states that the
church  is  unlikely  to  prevail,  it  misstates  the  legal  basis  for
this  conclusion.  The  quoted  provision  creates  a  fee  simple
determinable title in the church (because the title in this case
will be automatically forfeited to the grantor if the land is not
used  for  church  purposes),  not  a  restrictive  covenant.  A
restrictive  covenant  involves  a  promise  regarding  the  use  of
the  land  and  is  not  the  title  itself  (though  the  existence  of  a
restrictive  covenant  barring  non-church  uses  would,  like  the
determinable 
title
unmarketable).

fee  here,  be  enough 

render 

to 

(C) is wrong because it cites an irrelevant fact. The “so long
as  .  .  .”  clause  created  a  possibility  of  reverter,  making  the
church’s title unmarketable. The clause will not create a trust
for the benefit of religion, as this choice asserts (and even if it
did,  that  wouldn’t  prevent  the  possibility  of  reverter  from
operating to divest the buyer of title if he were forced to close
on the sale).

(D) is wrong because it’s gibberish. The choice seems to be
asserted  that  the  grantor  can’t  have  a  possibility  of  reverter
because  such  an  interest  would  be  inconsistent  with  the
warranty deed that grantor gave. But that’s flatly untrue — the
warranty  deed  just  asserts  that  whatever  title  grantor  is
conveying, he has (and in this case, he gave a lesser interest
than he had, i.e., reserved a possibility of reverter to himself).

2.  Fee simple subject to condition subsequent

a.  Distinguishing fee simple subject to condition precedent

Question 4: A landowner owned land in fee simple. A small
house  on  the  land  was  occupied,  with  the  landowner’s  oral
permission,  rent-free,  by  the  landowner’s  son  and  the  son’s
college classmate. The son was then 21 years old.
The  landowner,  by  properly  executed  instrument,  conveyed

541

the land to “my beloved son, his heirs and assigns, upon the
condition precedent that he earn a college degree by the time
he reaches the age of 30. If, for any reason, he does not meet
this condition, then the land shall become the sole property of
my  beloved  daughter,  her  heirs  and  assigns.”  At  the  time  of
the conveyance, the son and the classmate attended a college
located  several  blocks  from  the  land.  Neither  had  earned  a
college degree.

One  week  after  the  delivery  of  the  deed  to  the  son,  the  son
recorded the deed and immediately told the classmate that he,
the son, was going to begin charging the classmate rent since
“I am now your landlord.” There is no applicable statute.

The  son  and  the  classmate  did  not  reach  agreement,  and  the
son  served  the  appropriate  notice  to  terminate  whatever
tenancy  the  classmate  had.  The  son  then  sought,  in  an
appropriate action, to oust the classmate.

Who should prevail?
(A)    The  son,  because  the  conveyance  created  a  fee  simple

subject to divestment in the son.

(B)  The son, because the landowner’s conveyance terminated

the classmate’s tenancy.

(C)    The  classmate,  because  the  landowner’s  permission  to
occupy preceded the landowner’s conveyance to the son.
(D)  The classmate, because he is a tenant of the landowner,

not of the son.

Answer 4: Choice (D) is correct. The conveyance to the son
was a gift of a fee simple subject to the condition precedent
that the son get a college degree prior to turning 30. Until the
son got the degree, the conveyance did not create any present
possessory  interest  in  him  (and  the  possessory  interest
remained  in  the  landowner,  with  an  executory  interest  in  the
daughter ready to spring out of the landowner if the son turned
30  without  getting  the  degree).  Therefore,  the  classmate
continued to be a tenant of the landowner, not of the son, with
the  result  that  the  son  did  not  have  the  right  to  terminate  the
classmate’s tenancy or oust him.
(A)  is  wrong  because  the  phrase  “upon  the  condition
precedent . . .” in the landowner-to-son conveyance made the

542

gift  a  fee  simple  subject  to  a  condition  precedent,  not  a  fee
simple subject to divestment. (If the gift had read, “to my son
and his heirs, but if my son turns 30 without having obtained a
college  degree,  then  to  my  daughter,”  then  the  son  would
indeed  have  had  a  fee  simple  subject  to  divestment,  and  the
son would have won the case, making this choice correct.)

(B)  is  wrong  because  a  conveyance  by  the  owner  will  not
normally terminate a tenancy, even where the conveyance is a
transfer  of  a  fee  simple  absolute  or  a  fee  simple  subject  to
divestment; furthermore, in this case the conveyance was of a
fee  simple  subject  to  a  condition  precedent,  so  it  was  even
further from terminating the classmate’s tenancy.

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  the  permission  to  occupy
was both oral and rent-free establishes that it was a tenancy at
will  (or  else  a  license);  therefore,  it  could  be  terminated  at
any  time  by  either  party  acting  unilaterally.  Consequently,
although  this  choice  correctly  states  the  result  that  the
classmate  wins,  it  does  not  correctly  state  the  reason  this  is
so.

II.   THE LIFE ESTATE

A.  Duties and powers of life tenant

1.  Duties

a.  No waste

i.  Demolition and rebuilding

Question  5:  Alice  owned  a  commercial  property,  Eastgate,
consisting  of  a  one-story  building  rented  to  various  retail
stores and a very large parking lot. Two years ago, Alice died
and left Eastgate to her nephew, Paul, for life, with remainder
to  her  godson,  Richard,  his  heirs  and  assigns.  Paul  was  30
years old and Richard was 20 years old when Alice died. The
devise  of  Eastgate  was  made  subject  to  any  mortgage  on
Eastgate in effect at the time of Alice’s death.
When  Alice  executed  her  will,  the  balance  of  the  mortgage
debt  on  Eastgate  was  less  than  $5,000.  A  year  before  her
death, Alice suffered financial reverses; and in order to meet

543

her  debts,  she  had  mortgaged  Eastgate  to  secure  a  loan  of
$150,000.  The  entire  principal  of  the  mortgage  remained
outstanding when she died. As a result, the net annual income
from  Eastgate  was  reduced  not  only  by  real  estate  taxes  and
regular  maintenance  costs,  but  also  by  the  substantial
mortgage interest payments that were due each month.

Paul was very dissatisfied with the limited benefit that he was
receiving from the life estate. When, earlier this year, Acme,
Inc.,  proposed  to  purchase  Eastgate,  demolish  the  building,
pay off the mortgage, and construct a 30-story office building,
Paul  was  willing  to  accept  Acme’s  offer.  However,  Richard
adamantly  refused  the  offer,  even  though  Richard,  as  the
remainderman,  paid  the  principal  portion  of  each  monthly
mortgage  amortization  payment.  Richard  was  independently
wealthy  and  wanted  to  convert  Eastgate  into  a  public  park
when he became entitled to possession.

When Acme realized that Richard would not change his mind,
Acme modified its proposal to a purchase of the life estate of
Paul.  Acme  was  ready  to  go  ahead  with  its  building  plans,
relying  upon  a  large  life  insurance  policy  on  Paul’s  life  to
protect it against the economic risk of Paul’s death. Paul’s life
expectancy was 45 years.
When  Richard  learned  that  Paul  had  agreed  to  Acme’s
modified  proposal,  Richard  brought  an  appropriate  action
against them to enjoin their carrying it out.

There is no applicable statute.

The best argument for Richard is that

(A)    Acme  cannot  purchase  Paul’s  life  estate,  because  life

estates are not assignable.

(B)  the proposed demolition of the building constitutes waste.
(C)    Richard’s  payment  of  the  mortgage  principal  has
subrogated him to Paul’s rights as a life tenant and bars
Paul’s  assignment  of  the  life  estate  without  Richard’s
consent.

(D)  continued existence of the one-story building is more in
harmony  with  the  ultimate  use  as  a  park  than  the
proposed change in use.

544

Answer 5: Choice (B) is correct. Ordinarily, a life tenant may
not  demolish  a  structure  on  the  premises,  even  in  order  to
build a bigger structure at his own expense that would render
the  future  interest  more  valuable;  such  a  demolition  is
classified  as  waste.  Courts  have  recognized  a  narrow
exception where changes in the character of the neighborhood
have deprived the property in its present form of “reasonable
productivity  or  usefulness,”  but  this  would  probably  not  be
found to have occurred here, since the structure is being used
for retail stores and produces meaningful rent. (The problem
is the substantial mortgage that eats up the rents, not the lack
of  any  reasonably-productive  use.)  It  is  not  certain  that
Richard  would  win  with  this  argument  (since  Paul  might
succeed  in  establishing  the  no-reasonably-productive-use-in-
present-form  exception),  but  this  is  the  only  one  of  the  four
listed  arguments  that  might  plausibly  produce  a  victory  for
Richard.

(A) is wrong because life estates are completely assignable,
without  the  consent  of  the  holder  of  the  future  interest;  the
assignee simply receives a life estate per autre vie.

(C)  is  wrong  because  Richard’s  payment  of  the  mortgage
principal  does  not  change  his  rights;  even  without  such
payments  he  would  be  entitled  to  veto  a  demolition  and
replacement  of  the  premises  unless  the  narrow  exception
described in (B) applied.

(D) is wrong because the maintenance of “harmony” with the
use  envisioned  by  the  future  interest  holder  is  not  a  relevant
factor in the decision about whether the proposed use violates
the  latter’s  rights;  the  issue  is  whether  the  proposed  use
would or would not constitute “waste,” and harmony with the
future holder’s desires is not part of the waste analysis.

b.  Current operating expenses

i.  Taxes

Question 6: Ody, owner of Profitacre, executed an instrument
in the proper form of a deed, purporting to convey Profitacre
“to Leon for life, then to Ralph in fee simple.” Leon, who is
Ody’s  brother  and  Ralph’s  father,  promptly  began  to  manage
Profitacre,  which  is  valuable  income-producing  real  estate.

545

Leon collected all rents and paid all expenses, including real
estate  taxes.  Ralph  did  not  object,  and  this  state  of  affairs
continued  for  five  years  until  2007.  In  that  year,  Leon
executed  an  instrument  in  the  proper  form  of  a  deed,
purporting  to  convey  Profitacre  to  Mona.  Ralph,  no  admirer
of Mona, asserted his right to ownership of Profitacre. Mona
asserted her ownership and said that if Ralph had any rights
he  was  obligated  to  pay  real  estate  taxes,  even  though  Leon
had  been  kind  enough  to  pay  them  in  the  past.  Income  from
Profitacre  is  ample  to  cover  expenses,  including  real  estate
taxes.

In an appropriate action to determine the rights of the parties,
the court should decide

(A)  Leon’s purported deed forfeited his life estate, so Ralph

owns Profitacre in fee simple.

(B)  Mona owns an estate for her life, is entitled to all income,
and must pay real estate taxes; Ralph owns the remainder
interest.

(C)  Mona owns an estate for the life of Leon, is entitled to all
income, and must pay real estate taxes; Ralph owns the
remainder interest.

(D)  Mona owns an estate for the life of Leon and is entitled to
all income; Ralph owns the remainder interest, and must
pay real estate taxes.

Answer 6: Choice (C) is correct. When Leon, the life tenant,
purported to convey the fee simple to Mona, this conveyance
had  the  effect  of  conveying  all  of  Leon’s  interest  in  the
property,  i.e.,  his  life  tenancy.  Therefore,  Mona  had  a  life
estate per autre vie, i.e., an estate for the life of Leon. Once
Mona  stepped  into  Leon’s  shoes  as  life  tenant,  she  had  the
right  to  collect  all  income  from  the  property,  but  also  the
obligation to pay all current operating expenses including real
estate taxes. Ralph always had a remainder interest following
Leon’s life estate, and Ralph’s interest was not changed in any
way by Leon’s conveyance of his own interest to Mona.
(A)  is  wrong  because  a  life  tenant’s  attempt  to  convey  a  fee
simple  does  not  cause  the  life  estate  to  be  forfeited;  such  a
conveyance merely transfers to the grantee the entirety of the

546

grantor’s interest (i.e., the life tenancy).

(B) is wrong because what Mona received is precisely what
Leon had, namely an estate for the life of Leon.

(D) is wrong because real estate taxes are the responsibility
of the life tenant, not the remainderman.

c.  Payment of mortgage

i.  No personal obligation

Question  7:  A  testator  owned  in  fee  simple  a  farm  of  300
acres. He died and by will duly admitted to probate devised
the farm to his surviving widow, for life with remainder in fee
simple  to  his  three  children,  two  daughters  and  a  son.  All
three children survived the testator.

At the time of the testator’s death, there existed a mortgage on
the farm that the testator had given ten years before to secure a
loan for the purchase of the farm. At his death, there remained
unpaid  $40,000  in  principal,  payable  in  installments  of
$4,000 per year for the next ten years. In addition, there was
due  interest  at  the  rate  of  10%  per  annum,  payable  annually
with the installment of principal. The widow took possession
and  out  of  a  gross  income  of  $50,000  per  year  realized
$25,000 net after paying all expenses and charges except the
installment of principal and interest due on the mortgage.

The daughters wanted the three children, including the son, to
each  contribute  one-third  of  the  amounts  needed  to  pay  the
mortgage  installments.  The  son  objected,  contending  that  the
widow should pay all of these amounts out of the profits she
had  made  in  operation  of  the  farm.  When  foreclosure  of  the
mortgage seemed imminent, the son sought legal advice.

If the son obtained sound advice relating to his rights, he was
told that
(A)  his only protection would lie in instituting an action for
partition  to  compel  the  sale  of  the  life  estate  of  the
widow  and  to  obtain  the  value  of  the  son’s  one-third
interest in remainder.

(B)  he could obtain appropriate relief to compel the widow
personally  to  pay  the  sums  due  because  the  income  is
more than adequate to cover these amounts.

547

(C)  he could be compelled personally to pay his share of the
amounts due because discharge of the mortgage enhances
the principal.

(D)  he could not be held personally liable for any amount but
that his share in remainder could be lost if the mortgage
installments are not paid.

Answer  7:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  general  rule  about
personal  liability  for  mortgage  payments  as  between  present
and future interests is that neither party has personal liability,
except  to  the  extent  that  party  is  receiving  net  operating
income from the property. Since the son as remainderman gets
no  operating  income  from  the  property,  he  has  no  personal
liability to make any mortgage payments. However, if neither
he nor anyone else makes all required mortgage payments, the
property  will  presumably  be  lost  to  foreclosure,  in  which
case the son’s remainder interest will be lost. Therefore, the
son  has  the  right  (which  he  may  well  want  to  exercise),  but
not  the  obligation,  to  contribute  his  one-third  share  of
whatever  mortgage  payments  that  the  widow  is  unable  or
unwilling to make.

(A) is wrong because the holder of a future interest generally
does  not  have  the  right  to  bring  a  partition  action  to  compel
the  sale  of  the  possessory  estate  (here,  the  widow’s  life
estate).

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  overstates  the  widow’s  obligation;
the  widow  probably  does  have  a  personal  obligation  to  pay
her fairly-allocated share of the mortgage payments (based on
the  relative  value  of  the  widow’s  life  estate  versus  the
remainder),  up  to  the  amount  of  net  income  she’s  receiving,
but  this  choice  incorrectly  suggests  that  she  would  be
personally liable to pay the entire installments rather than just
her share if the net income were large enough.
(C)  is  wrong  because  the  son,  as  a  remainderman,  has  no
personal liability to make mortgage payments at all (since he
is not getting any operating income out of which to pay them).

548

CHAPTER 3
FUTURE INTERESTS

I.    POSSIBILITY OF REVERTER; RIGHT OF RE-

ENTRY

A.  Possibility of reverter and right of re-entry

1.  Possibility of reverter

a.  Conflict between will and inheritance

Question  8:  Twenty  years  ago,  a  landowner  who  owned
Blackacre, a one-acre tract of land, duly delivered a deed of
Blackacre “to School District so long as it is used for school
purposes.”  The  deed  was  promptly  and  properly  recorded.
Five years ago, the landowner died, leaving Sonny as his only
heir  at  law.  The  landowner  left  a  duly  probated  will,  by
which he left “all my Estate” to his friend, who was a doctor.

Last  month,  School  District  closed  its  school  on  Blackacre
and  for  valid  consideration  duly  executed  and  delivered  a
quitclaim deed of Blackacre to a developer, who planned to
use the land for commercial development. The developer has
now  brought  an  appropriate  action  to  quiet  title  against  the
son, the doctor and School District.

The only applicable statute is a provision in the jurisdiction’s
probate code which provides that any property interest which
is descendible is devisable.

In such action, the court should find that title is now in

(A)  the developer.
(B)  the son.
(C)  the doctor.
(D)  School District.
Answer  8:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  When  the  landowner
conveyed to School District, School District got a fee simple
determinable (a fee simple that would automatically end if the
property  ever  ceased  to  be  used  for  school  purposes).  The
landowner  retained  a  possibility  of  reverter,  which  is  what

549

the grantor retains following a fee simple determinable, if the
fee  simple  determinable  doesn’t  specify  what  happens  upon
failure of the condition. In virtually all states, a possibility of
reverter can be inherited under the intestacy statute (i.e., it is
“descendible”). The probate provision here tells us that if the
interest is descendible, it is also devisable (i.e., can be left by
will).  Since  we  know  that  the  possibility  of  reverter  is
descendible,  we  therefore  know  that  it  is  also  devisable.
Since  the  landowner  left  a  will  devising  his  entire  estate  to
the doctor, the reverter will pass by devise (i.e., by the will),
not by inheritance. That’s because of the basic rule that where
a particular item of property is covered by a valid bequest in
a  will,  the  item  will  pass  by  will  rather  than  by  intestacy.
Therefore, the reverter goes to the doctor under the will.

(A) is wrong because once School District closed its school,
its interest in Blackacre was automatically extinguished, and
there  was  nothing  left  to  pass  to  the  developer  via  the
quitclaim deed.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  son’s  status  as  heir  (i.e.,  as  taker
under  the  intestacy  statute)  was  irrelevant  given  that  the
reverter  here  was  bequeathed  under  the  will,  and  was
therefore not available to be passed by inheritance.
(D) is wrong because once School District closed its school,
its interest was automatically extinguished.

II.   REMAINDERS

A.  Contingent remainders

Question 9: A testator owned a tract of land in fee simple. By
will  duly  admitted  to  probate  after  his  death,  the  testator
devised  the  land  to  “any  wife  who  survives  me  with
remainder to such of my children as are living at her death.”

The  testator  was  survived  by  his  widow  and  by  three
children,  who  were  an  accountant,  a  lawyer,  and  a  doctor.
Thereafter,  the  lawyer  died  and  by  will  duly  admitted  to
probate devised his entire estate to his friend. The accountant
and the doctor were the lawyer’s heirs at law.
Later the widow died. In an appropriate lawsuit to which the

550

accountant,  the  doctor,  and  the  friend  are  parties,  title  to  the
land is at issue.

In such lawsuit, judgment should be that title to the property is
in

(A)    the  accountant,  the  doctor,  and  the  friend,  because  the
earliest  vesting  of  remainders  is  favored  and  reference
to  the  surviving  wife’s  death  should  be  construed  as
relating to time of taking possession.

(B)    the  accountant,  the  doctor,  and  the  friend,  because  the
provision  requiring  survival  of  children  violates  the
Rule Against Perpetuities since the surviving wife might
have been a person unborn at the time of writing of the
will.

(C)    the  accountant  and  the  doctor,  because  the  lawyer’s
is  not

intestacy  and 

remainder  must  descend  by 
devisable.

(D)    the  accountant  and  the  doctor,  because  the  remainders

were contingent upon surviving the life tenant.

Answer 9:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  terms  of  the  bequest
made  it  clear  that  only  a  child  who  survived  the  testator’s
wife would take. Each child had a contingent remainder as of
the testator’s death. When the lawyer died before his mother
(the  widow)  died,  the  lawyer’s  contingent  remainder  was
nullified  without  ever  becoming  vested,  leaving  nothing  to
pass to the lawyer’s friend by devise. At the widow’s death,
the  contingent  remainders  in  the  accountant  and  the  doctor
vested (and, simultaneously, became possessory).

(A) is wrong for the same reason (D) is right: The remainders
were intended by the testator to be contingent unless and until
the  remaindermen  survived  the  widow,  at  which  time  they
would  vest.  So  when  the  lawyer  died,  his  contingent
remainder  was  destroyed  by  his  failing  to  have  survived  the
widow, and he had no interest to pass to the friend.
(B) is wrong because under the common law approach to the
Rule  against  Perpetuities,  the  time  for  evaluating  a  will  is
when the testator dies, not when the will was executed. At the
time the testator died, his widow (and, indeed, his children as
well)  were  necessarily  already  in  existence,  and  could

551

therefore serve as measuring lives. So there was no risk that
the  remainder  to  the  testator’s  children  would  vest  beyond
“measuring  lives  plus  21  years,”  making  the  gift  to  those
children valid contingent remainders.

(C) is wrong as a matter of law: Some remainders can indeed
descend  by  intestacy.  Example:  O  bequeaths  “to  A  for  life,
then to B.” Assume B is living at O’s death, but dies intestate
before  A,  and  with  C  as  his  heir  at  law.  At  B’s  death,  the
vested  remainder  in  B  passes  by  intestacy  to  C,  and  C  will
have a fee simple once B dies.

formalities, a will that devised the tract to ‘‘my daughter for
life  with  remainder  to  my  descendants  per  stirpes.’’  At  the
time  of  writing  the  will,  the  testator  had  a  husband  and  no
descendants  living  other  than  her  two  children,  the  daughter
named in the will and a son.

the 

The testator died and the will was duly admitted to probate.
The testator’s husband predeceased her, but she was survived
by  her  daughter,  her  son,  four  grandchildren,  and  one  great-
grandchild.  The  testator’s  two  children  were  the  testator’s
sole  heirs  at  law.  The  testator’s  children  brought  an
appropriate  action  for  declaratory  judgment  as  to  title  of  the
tract. Guardians ad litem were appointed and all other steps
were  taken  so  that  the  judgment  would  bind  all  persons
interested whether born or unborn. In that action, if the court
rules that the daughter has a life estate in the whole of the tract
and  that  the  remainder  is  contingent,  it  will  be  because  the
court chose one of several possible constructions and that the
chosen construction
(A)  related all vesting to the time of writing of the will.
(B)  related all vesting to the death of the testator.
(C)    implied  a  condition  that  remaindermen  survive  the

daughter.

(D)  implied a gift of a life estate to the son.
Answer  10:  Choice  (C)  is  correct,  because  if  no  condition
that  the  remaindermen  survive  the  daughter  was  implied,  the
than  contingent.  A
remainder  would  be  vested  rather 

552

remainder  is  contingent  if  it  is  subject  to  a  condition
precedent  (other  than  the  mere  expiration  of  the  preceding
estate) that must be satisfied before the remainder can become
a  present  interest.  A  common  type  of  condition  precedent  is
the  requirement  that  the  holder  of  the  remainder  survive  the
holder of the previous estate (often a life estate), and that is
what  we  might  have  here.  There  are  two  most  plausible
interpretations  of  what 
testator  meant  by  “my
the 
descendants”:  (1)  “all  of  my  descendants  existing  and
identifiable  at  the  moment  of  my  own  death”  (when  the
remainder is being created); or (2) “all of my descendants in
existence when the remainder becomes possessory” (i.e., all
descendants who survive the daughter). If interpretation (1) is
chosen by the court, the remainder would be vested, because
at  the  moment  of  the  testator’s  death  we  would  know
everyone who was to take, and if any later pre-deceased the
daughter, their heirs could take. If interpretation (2) is chosen,
we  would  not  know  who  takes  until  the  daughter  dies,  at
which  point  we  would  look  to  which  descendants  of  the
testator  survived  the  daughter;  in  that  event,  the  remainder
would be contingent as of the testator’s death (because at the
moment  when  the  testator  created  the  interest  by  dying,  we
don’t  know  who  will  take).  So  it  is  only  if  the  court  selects
interpretation (2) (imputing a condition that the remaindermen
must survive the daughter in order to take) that the remainder
would be deemed contingent at the present time.

(A)  is  wrong  because  if  vesting  occurred  at  the  moment  the
will  was  written,  the  remainder  would  be  vested  as  of  the
testator’s death, not contingent. This choice is referring to the
possibility  that  the  court  would  conclude  that  the  bequest’s
reference  to  “my  descendants”  meant  “anyone  who  is  my
descendant  viewed  as  of  the  moment  when  I  am  writing  this
will.” If this were the interpretation, then at the moment of the
will-writing,  we  would  know  everyone  who  could  take
(they’re  all  identifiable,  and  their  remainder  interests  would
vest  immediately  even  though  the  remainder  would  not
become possessory until the daughter died). In that event, the
remainder would be vested, not contingent.
(B)  is  wrong  because  if  all  vesting  were  related  to  the

553

at 

the  remainder  would  be  vested,  not
testator’s  death, 
contingent, 
vesting/contingent
that  moment.  The 
determination  is  to  be  made  at  the  moment  the  interest  (the
remainder)  is  created.  That  moment  of  creation  is  the
testator’s  death.  Saying  that  “all  vesting  is  [related]  to  the
death  of  the  testator,”  as  this  choice  does,  is  equivalent  to
saying that to be a “descendant,” a person just has to survive
the testator, not the daughter. In that scenario, at the moment of
the  testator’s  death,  the  remaindermen  would  be  fully
identifiable,  and  would  be  certain  to  take  once  the  daughter
died.  So  on  this  analysis,  all  remainder  holders  would  be
vested (because fully identified as of the moment of creation
of the interest, and certain to take), not contingent.

(D) is wrong because an interpretation giving a remainder life
estate to the son wouldn’t automatically make that remainder
contingent. Even in the unlikely event the court implied a life
estate remainder to the son, we still wouldn’t know whether
that  remainder  was  vested  or  contingent,  since  we  wouldn’t
know whether there was a requirement that the son survive the
daughter  (it  would  be  contingent  if  there  were  a  survival
requirement,  vested  if  there  were  not).  In  other  words,
reading in a remainder for life to the son doesn’t fully answer
the vested/contingent question — of the four choices, only the
choice  that  implies  a  surviving-the-  daughter  condition
(Choice (C)) does that.

1.  Unborn or unascertained

a.  Remainder “to A and her heirs or assigns” is vested

Question 11: A grantor owned a tract of land in fee simple.
By warranty deed he conveyed the land to his nephew for life
“and from and after the death of my nephew to my niece, her
heirs and assigns.”
Subsequently the niece died, devising all of her estate to the
niece’s  boyfriend.  The  niece  was  survived  by  a  cousin,  her
sole heir-at-law.

Shortly  thereafter  the  nephew  died,  survived  by  the  grantor,
the niece’s boyfriend, and the niece’s cousin.
Title to the land now is in

554

(A)    the  grantor,  because  the  contingent  remainder  never
vested  and  the  grantor’s  reversion  was  entitled  to
possession immediately upon the nephew’s death.
(B)  the boyfriend, because the vested remainder in the niece

was transmitted by her will.

(C)  the cousin, because she is the niece’s heir.
(D)  either the grantor or the cousin, depending upon whether
the destructibility of contingent remainders is recognized
in the applicable jurisdiction.

Answer  11:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  remainder  to  “my
niece, her heirs and assigns” was a remainder to the niece in
fee  simple.  Since  the  niece  was  alive  and  identifiable  at  the
time  of  the  grantor’s  deed,  the  remainder  to  the  niece  was
vested. A vested remainder can be left by will. Therefore, the
remainder passed by the will to the boyfriend.

(A) is wrong because the remainder was never contingent, not
even for an instant.

(C)  is  wrong  because  a  vested  remainder  can  be  passed  by
will, and the will here devised the remainder to the boyfriend;
therefore, the fact that the niece’s cousin was the niece’s heir
at law is irrelevant.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  remainder  here  was  vested,  not
contingent; 
the  doctrine  of  destructibility  of
therefore, 
contingent remainders is irrelevant.

III.  THE RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES (RAP)

A.  Applicability of Rule to various estates

1.  Options to purchase land

a.  Right of first refusal (RAP may apply)

Question 12: A grantor owned two tracts of land, one of 15
acres  and  another  of  five  acres.  The  two  tracts  were  a  mile
apart.
Fifteen years ago, the grantor conveyed the smaller tract to a
grantee. The grantor retained the larger tract. The deed to the
grantee contained, in addition to proper legal descriptions of
the
both  properties  and 

identifications  of 

the  parties, 

555

following:

                              I, the grantor, bind myself and my heirs and assigns that in the event that the larger tract that I now
retain is ever offered for sale, I will notify the grantee and his heirs and assigns in writing, and the
grantee  and  his  heirs  and  assigns  shall  have  the  right  to  purchase  the  larger  tract  for  its  fair
market  value  as  determined  by  a  board  consisting  of  three  qualified  expert  independent  real
estate appraisers.

With  appropriate  references  to  the  other  property  and  the
parties, there followed a reciprocal provision that conferred
upon  the  grantor  and  her  heirs  and  assigns  a  similar  right  to
purchase  the  smaller  tract,  purportedly  binding  the  grantee
and his heirs and assigns.

Ten years ago, a corporation acquired the larger tract from the
grantor. At that time, the grantee had no interest in acquiring
the  larger  tract  and  by  an  appropriate  written  document
released any interest he or his heirs or assigns might have had
in the larger tract.

Last  year,  the  grantee  died.  The  smaller  tract  passed  by  the
grantee’s  will  to  his  daughter.  She  has  decided  to  sell  the
smaller tract. However, because she believes the corporation
has been a very poor steward of the larger tract, she refuses to
sell  the  smaller  tract  to  the  corporation  even  though  she  has
offered it for sale in the local real estate market.

The  corporation  brought  an  appropriate  action  for  specific
performance  after  taking  all  of  the  necessary  preliminary
steps in its effort to exercise its rights to purchase the smaller
tract.

The daughter asserted all possible defenses.

The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in
the jurisdiction.
If the court rules for the daughter, what is the reason?
(A)  The provision setting out the right to purchase violates the

Rule Against Perpetuities.

(B)  The grantee’s release 10 years ago operates as a waiver
regarding any right to purchase that the corporation might
have.

(C)  The two tracts of land were not adjacent parcels of real
estate,  and  thus  the  right  to  purchase  is  in  gross  and  is

556

therefore unenforceable.

(D)    Noncompliance  with  a  right  to  purchase  gives  rise  to  a
claim  for  money  damages,  but  not  for  specific
performance.

Answer  12:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Each  of  the  original
parties  granted  a  reciprocal  right  of  first  refusal  to  the  other
and  the  other’s  heirs  and  assigns.  A  right  of  first  refusal
provides  that  if  the  owner  ever  decides  to  sell  the  property,
the  one  holding  the  right  of  first  refusal  has  the  right  to
purchase it. A right of first refusal is therefore a conditional
option  to  purchase,  and  it  is  analyzed  for  Rule  Against
Perpetuities (RAP) issues like other purchase options that are
“in gross” (i.e., not associated with a lease). Courts are split
as  to  whether  to  apply  the  RAP  to  rights  of  first  refusal  or
other options in gross. We don’t know here that the RAP will
definitely be applied to such interests, but we do know that if
it’s applied, the daughter will win (and the question is asking
what  the  reason  will  be  if  the  daughter  wins).  Why  will  the
daughter win? Because the RAP invalidates an interest unless
it  can  be  said  with  certainty  at  the  time  of  creation  that  that
interest  will  vest  or  fail  to  vest  within  21  years.  Here,  the
right  of  first  refusal  extended  to  the  heirs  and  assigns  of  the
original  parties,  so  the  decision  to  exercise  the  right  might
occur more than 21 years after a life in being at the time the
right  was  granted.  (For 
the  grantor’s  great-
grandchild  might  try  to  exercise  the  right  as  against  the
grantee’s  great-grandchild.)  The  RAP  in  this  jurisdiction  is
unmodified by statute — therefore, the right of first refusal is
deemed void as of the time it was created, and the court will
not  wait  to  see  whether  anyone  tries  to  exercise  that  right
more  than  21  years  after  a  life  in  being.  Consequently,  the
right  is  already  invalid,  even  though  only  15  years  have
passed since the right was created.

instance, 

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  the  grantee  chose  not  to
exercise his right of first refusal has no effect on whether the
grantor  can  exercise  the  reciprocal  right  of  first  refusal
regarding  the  land  originally  owned  by  the  grantee.  That  is,
even  if  the  grantee’s  decision  not  to  exercise  the  right  10
years ago was a waiver of any subsequent right of first refusal

557

on  the  part  of  the  grantee  or  his  heirs  (which  it  almost
certainly  was),  there  would  be  no  reason  why  that  decision
should  act  as  a  waiver  by  the  grantor  or  her  heirs  as  to  the
reciprocal right held by them.

(C) is wrong because it misstates the effect of the fact that the
option is “in gross.” An option “in gross” is an option that is
not  associated  with  a  lease  to  the  option-holder  of  the
property  to  which  the  option  applies.  So  the  right  of  first
refusal  here  is  indeed  an  option  in  gross,  as  the  choice
suggests.  But  the  choice  is  wrong  for  two  reasons:  (1)  an
option  in  gross  is  enforceable  as  long  as  the  time  period
during  which  it  can  be  enforced  is  not  longer  than  the  RAP
period (i.e., not longer than lives in being plus 21 years); and
(2) the fact that the parcels are not adjacent is irrelevant to the
analysis. (That is, even if the two parcels were adjacent, the
option would still be in gross because there is no lease.)

(D) is wrong because it misstates the remedies for breach of a
right of first refusal. A holder of a purchase option is entitled
to  a  decree  of  specific  performance,  under  which  the  other
party  will  be  compelled  to  make  the  sale  in  return  for  the
payment of the option’s strike price. A right of first refusal is
a  conditional  option  to  purchase.  Once  the  condition  is
satisfied (by the other party’s decision to sell), the holder of
the  option  has  the  same  right  to  a  decree  of  specific
performance  as  would  the  holder  of  an  unconditional
purchase option.

CHAPTER 4
CONCURRENT OWNERSHIP

I.    JOINT TENANCY

A.  Severance

1.  Conveyance by one joint tenant

a.  Most important on MBE

Question 13:  By  warranty  deed,  Marta  conveyed  Blackacre
to  Beth  and  Christine  “as  joint  tenants  with  right  of
survivorship.”  Beth  and  Christine  are  not  related.  Beth
conveyed  all  her  interest  to  Eugenio  by  warranty  deed  and
subsequently died intestate. Thereafter, Christine conveyed to
Darin by warranty deed.

There is no applicable statute, and the jurisdiction recognizes
the common-law joint tenancy.

                    Title to Blackacre is in
(A)  Darin.
(B)  Marta.
(C)  Darin and Eugenio.
(D)  Darin and the heirs of Beth.
Answer 13: Choice (C) is correct. When Beth conveyed her
interest to Eugenio, this act caused a severance, destroying the
joint tenancy immediately and leaving Eugenio and Christine
as  tenants  in  common.  When  Christine  conveyed  her  interest
to Darin, he stepped into Christine’s shoes, becoming a tenant
in common with Eugenia.
Choices  (A),  (B),  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  they  are
inconsistent with the above analysis.

b.  Motive irrelevant

Question 14: A brother and sister owned a large tract of land
in  fee  simple  as  joint  tenants  with  rights  of  survivorship.
While  the  sister  was  on  an  extended  safari  in  Kenya,  the
brother  learned  that  there  were  very  valuable  coal  deposits
within  the  land,  but  he  made  no  attempt  to  inform  his  sister.

559

Thereupon, the brother conveyed his interest in the land to his
wife, who immediately reconveyed that interest to the brother.
The common-law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute.

Shortly  thereafter,  the  brother  was  killed  in  an  automobile
accident.  His  will,  which  was  duly  probated,  specifically
devised his one-half interest in the property to his wife.

The  sister  then  returned  from  Kenya  and  learned  what  had
happened. The sister brought an appropriate action against the
brother’s  wife,  who  claimed  a  one-half  interest  in  the
property,  seeking  a  declaratory  judgment  that  she,  the  sister,
was the sole owner of the land.

In this action, who should prevail?

(A)  The brother’s wife, because the brother and sister were
tenants in common at the time of the brother’s death.
(B)    The  brother’s  wife,  because  the  brother’s  will  severed

the joint tenancy.

(C)  The sister, because the joint tenancy was reestablished by

the brother’s wife’s reconveyance to the brother.

(D)    The  sister,  because  the  brother  breached  his  fiduciary

duty as her joint tenant.

Answer  14:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  When  the  brother
conveyed  his  interest  in  the  property  to  his  wife,  this
conveyance  acted  as  an  immediate  severance,  transforming
the joint tenancy into a tenancy in common between the wife
and the sister. When the wife immediately reconveyed to the
brother, the brother and sister were tenants in common. When
the  brother  died,  his  interest  as  a  tenant  in  common  passed
back  to  his  wife,  making  her  a  tenant  in  common  with  the
sister.
(B) is wrong because the joint tenancy was severed before the
brother’s will took effect (at the moment the brother conveyed
to his wife).
(C)  is  wrong  because  once  the  joint  tenancy  was  broken  by
the conveyance from the brother to his wife, it could only be
reestablished by a new conveyance joined in by both tenants
in common, i.e., the wife and the sister (or, later, the brother
and sister).

560

(D)  is  wrong  because  a  conveyance  by  either  joint  tenant
severs  the  joint  tenancy  regardless  of  whether  the  conveying
joint  tenant  had  or  breached  any  fiduciary  obligation  to  the
other.

2.  Creditors of deceased joint tenant take nothing

Question  15:  A  brother  and  sister  owned  a  parcel  as  joint
tenants,  upon  which  was  situated  a  two-family  house.  The
brother lived in one of the two apartments and rented the other
apartment to a tenant. The brother got in a fight with the tenant
and  injured  him.  The  tenant  obtained  and  properly  filed  a
judgment for $10,000 against the brother.

The statute in the jurisdiction reads: “Any judgment properly
filed  shall,  for  ten  years  from  filing,  be  a  lien  on  the  real
property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person
against whom the judgment is rendered.”

The  sister,  who  lived  in  a  distant  city,  knew  nothing  of  the
tenant’s  judgment.  Before  the  tenant  took  any  further  action,
the  brother  died.  The  common-law 
is
unmodified by statute.

tenancy 

joint 

The  sister  then  learned  the  facts  and  brought  an  appropriate
action against the tenant to quiet title to the land.

The court should hold that the tenant has
(A)  a lien against the whole of the property, because he was a
tenant of both the brother and the sister at the time of the
judgment.

(B)  a lien against the brother’s undivided one-half interest in
the  land,  because  his  judgment  was  filed  prior  to  the
brother’s death.

(C)    no  lien,  because  the  sister  had  no  actual  notice  of  the

tenant’s judgment until after the brother’s death.

(D)    no  lien,  because  the  brother’s  death  terminated  the

interest to which the tenant’s lien attached.

Answer  15:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Since  the  tenant’s
judgment  was  only  against  the  brother,  the  tenant’s  judgment
lien  was  only  against  the  brother’s  real  property,  not  the
sister’s  real  property.  That  real  property  consisted  of  the
brother’s joint tenancy interest. At the moment of the brother’s

561

death, that joint tenancy interest ceased to exist, and there was
nothing left for the judgment lien to be a lien against.

(A) is wrong because the basis for the tenant’s judgment (and
thus  for  his  judgment  lien)  was  the  brother’s  having  injured
him in the fight; since this had nothing to do with the tenant’s
having  been  a  tenant  of  both  brother  and  sister,  it  did  not
create any lien against the sister’s interest in the property.

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  inaccurately  characterizes  the
brother’s  interest:  It  was  a  joint  tenancy,  not  an  “undivided
one-half interest” (a phrase that would be used to describe a
tenancy in common). Therefore, the fact that the judgment was
filed  while  the  brother  was  still  alive  is  irrelevant,  because
the  brother’s  joint  tenancy  ceased  to  exist  at  the  moment  he
died.

(C) is wrong because it cites an irrelevant factor; even if the
sister had had actual notice of the judgment while the brother
was still alive, there would be no lien after the brother died
for the reasons described in the discussion of (D).

II.   TENANCY IN COMMON

A.  Tenancy in common

1.  Conveyance by one co-tenant

a.  Grant of mortgage or judgment lien

Question 16: A mother owned a two-family apartment house
on a small city lot not suitable for partition-in-kind. Upon the
mother’s death, her will devised the property to “my son and
my daughter.”
A week ago, a creditor of the son obtained a money judgment
against the son, and properly filed the judgment in the county
where  the  property  is  located.  A  statute  in  the  jurisdiction
provides:  Any  judgment  properly  filed  shall,  for  ten  years
from  filing,  be  a  lien  on  the  real  property  then  owned  or
subsequently  acquired  by  any  person  against  whom  the
judgment is rendered.
The son needed cash, but the daughter did not wish to sell the
property.  The  son  commenced  a  partition  action  against  the

562

daughter and the creditor.

Assume that the court properly ordered a partition by judicial
sale.

After the sale, the creditor’s judgment will be a lien on

(A)  all of the property.
(B)  only a one-half interest in the property.
(C)  all of the proceeds of sale of the property.
(D)  only the portion of the proceeds of sale due the son.
Answer 16: Choice (D) is correct. The mother’s will had the
effect  of  giving  the  property  to  the  son  and  the  daughter  as
tenants in common, with an undivided one-half interest going
to  each.  (A  conveyance  “to  A  and  B,”  without  further
specification,  creates  a  tenancy  in  common  with  equal
shares.)  At  the  time  the  creditor  got  his  money  judgment
against the son, that judgment became a lien only against real
property  owned  by  the  son,  and  the  son’s  real  property
consisted  of  his  undivided  one-half  interest.  When  the
partition  by  judicial  sale  occurred,  the  son’s  interest  in  the
property became sole ownership of one-half of the proceeds,
and  the  creditor’s  lien  became  a  lien  solely  on  that  share  of
the proceeds.

Choices  (A),  (B),  and  (C)  are  wrong  because  they  are
inconsistent with the above analysis.

LANDLORD AND TENANT

I.    TORT LIABILITY OF LANDLORD AND

TENANT

A.  Landlord’s liability

1.  Common law

a.  Assignment of interest by L

Question 17:  Les  leased  a  barn  to  his  neighbor,  Tom,  for  a
term of three years. Tom took possession of the barn and used
it  for  his  farming  purposes.  The  lease  made  Les  responsible
for  structural  repairs  to  the  barn,  unless  they  were  made
necessary by actions of Tom.

One year later, Les conveyed the barn and its associated land
to  Lottie  “subject  to  the  lease  to  Tom.”  Tom  paid  the  next
month’s  rent  to  Lottie.  The  next  day  a  portion  of  an  exterior
wall  of  the  barn  collapsed  because  of  rot  in  the  interior
structure of the wall. The wall had appeared to be sound, but
a  competent  engineer,  on  inspection,  would  have  discovered
its  condition.  Neither  Lottie  nor  Tom  had  the  barn  inspected
by an engineer. Tom was injured as a result of the collapse of
the wall.

Les  had  known  that  the  wall  was  dangerously  weakened  by
rot  and  needed  immediate  repairs,  but  had  not  told  Tom  or
Lottie. There is no applicable statute.

Tom  brought  an  appropriate  action  against  Les  to  recover
damages for the injuries he sustained. Lottie was not a party.
Which  of  the  following  is  the  most  appropriate  comment
concerning the outcome of this action?
(A)    Tom  should  lose,  because  Lottie  assumed  all  of  Les’s

obligations by reason of Tom’s attornment to her.

(B)    Tom  should  recover,  because  there  is  privity  between
lessor and lessee and it cannot be broken unilaterally.
(C)  Tom should recover, because Les knew of the danger but

564

did not warn Tom.

(D)  Tom should lose, because he failed to inspect the barn.
Answer 17: Choice (C) is correct. A landlord generally does
not  have  tort  liability  for  accidents  that  arise  out  of  a
dangerous condition on the property. For example, a landlord
has  no  duty  to  inspect  the  property  to  discover  dangerous
conditions. But the landlord does have liability if he knows of
the danger, or is in possession of facts that would reasonably
have led a person in his position to know of the danger, and
the  tenant  does  not  know  of  the  danger.  Les  met  this
requirement because the facts tell us that he had “known that
the  wall  was  dangerously  weakened  by  rot  and  needed
immediate  repairs.”  When  Les  assigned  to  Lottie,  Les
remained liable until Lottie actually discovered the condition
and  had  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  fix  it.  Since  Lottie  had
only owned the property for one day before the accident, and
had not learned of the condition, liability had not yet passed
to  Lottie,  and  thus  remained  with  Les,  at  the  moment  of  the
accident.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  while  Lottie  took  “subject  to”  the
lease,  she  did  not  assume  Les’s  obligations  to  Tom,  and  her
receipt of a payment from Tom did not change this. By the rule
discussed  in  the  prior  paragraph,  Lottie  would  not  become
liable for the condition until she learned of it and had time to
fix  it  (unless  she  expressly  assumed  liability  for  conditions
not known to her, which didn’t happen here).

(B)  is  wrong  because  a  landlord  is  liable  to  the  tenant  for
failing to disclose a known dangerous condition. That liability
persists  regardless  of  whether  landlord  and  tenant  remain  in
privity  of  estate  (and  ends  only  when  the  successor  on  the
landlord  side  becomes  liable,  which  could  only  have  been
when the successor learned of the condition and had a chance
to fix it).
(D) is wrong because, where a landlord is actually aware of a
dangerous condition, and the tenant is not aware, the landlord
is liable regardless of whether the tenant could have (or even
reasonably  should  have)  inspected  the  premises.  In  other
words, the tenant has no duty to inspect, at least in a scenario
where the landlord has actual knowledge of the danger.

II.   TRANSFER AND SALE BY LESSOR;

ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING BY LESSEE

A.  Generally allowed

1.  Distinguish assignment from sublease

a.  Significance

i.  Question might not say “sublease”

Question 18:  A  landlord  leased  an  apartment  to  a  tenant  by
written lease for two years ending on the last day of a recent
month.  The  lease  provided  for  $700  monthly  rental.  The
tenant occupied the apartment and paid the rent for the first 15
months  of  the  lease  term,  until  he  moved  to  a  new  job  in
another city. Without consulting the landlord, the tenant moved
a  friend  into  the  apartment  and  signed  an  informal  writing
transferring  to  the  friend  his  “lease  rights”  for  the  remaining
nine  months  of  the  lease.  The  friend  made  the  next  four
monthly  $700  rental  payments  to  the  landlord.  For  the  final
five months of the lease term, no rent was paid by anyone, and
the friend moved out with three months left on the lease term.
The  landlord  was  on  an  extended  trip  abroad,  and  did  not
learn  of  the  default  and  the  vacancy  until  last  week.  The
landlord sued the tenant and the friend, jointly and severally,
for $3,500 for the last five months’ rent.

What is the likely outcome of the lawsuit?

(A)    Both  the  tenant  and  the  friend  are  liable  for  the  full
$3,500, because the tenant is liable on privity of contract
and the friend is liable on privity of estate as assignee.

(B)  The friend is liable for $1,400 on privity of estate, which
lasted only until he vacated, and the tenant is liable for
$2,100  on  privity  of  contract  and  estate  for  the  period
after the friend vacated.

(C)  The friend is liable for $3,500 on privity of estate and the
tenant  is  not  liable,  because  the  landlord’s  failure  to
object to the friend’s payment of rent relieved the tenant
of liability.

(D)  The tenant is liable for $3,500 on privity of contract and
the  friend  is  not  liable,  because  a  sublessee  does  not

566

have personal liability to the original landlord.

Answer  18:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  An  assignment  arises
when a tenant transfers all or some of the leased premises to
another  for  the  remainder  of  the  lease  term,  retaining  no
interest  in  the  assigned  premises.  In  this  case,  prior  to  the
agreement  with  the  friend,  the  tenant  had  privity  of  contract
with  the  landlord  because  of  the  lease.  The  tenant  also  had
privity  of  estate  because  the  tenant  was  in  possession  of  the
apartment. Subsequently, an assignment arose when the tenant
transferred the premises to the friend for the remainder of the
lease  term  of  nine  months.  The  friend  was  then  in  privity  of
estate  with  the  landlord  as  to  all  promises  that  run  with  the
land,  including  the  covenant  to  pay  rent.  (When  the  friend
moved out, this did not end the privity of estate, because the
friend did not assign to someone else, and simply abandoned
the  premises.  See  Rest.  2d  (Landlord  &  Tenant),  §  16.1,
Illustr.  24.)  The  tenant  was  not  released  by  the  landlord,
however, and thus remained liable on privity of contract.
(B)  is  incorrect,  because  the  friend  entered  privity  of  estate
with  the  landlord  when  he  received  the  assignment,  and  this
privity of estate remained with the friend until the end of the
lease  because  the  friend  made  no  assignment.  Therefore,  the
friend remained liable on privity of estate for the period after
he vacated. Furthermore, because the landlord never released
the  tenant,  the  tenant  remained  liable  for  the  full  $3,500  on
privity of contract.

(C)  is  incorrect,  because  the  landlord  never  released  the
tenant, thereby keeping the tenant liable on privity of contract
based  on  the  original  lease.  (There  was  no  express  release,
and  a  release  would  not  be  implied  merely  because  the
landlord accepted rent from the friend.)
(D)  is  incorrect,  because  this  choice  assumes  that  the  friend
was a sublessee, which he was not. A sublease arises when a
tenant  transfers  the  right  of  possession  to  all  or  some  of  the
leased premises to another for a time less than the remaining
time  of  the  lease,  or  when  the  tenant  retains  some  other
interest  in  the  premises.  Here,  the  tenant  transferred  all  the
remaining time of the lease to the friend and retained no other
interest.  Accordingly,  this  was  an  assignment  and  not  a

567

sublease.  As  an  assignee,  the  friend  was  in  privity  of  estate
with  the  landlord  as  to  all  promises  that  run  with  the  land,
including the covenant to pay rent.

B.  Running of benefit and burden

1.  Purchase options in leases

a.  Split on exercise apart from lease

Question 19:  Lanny,  the  owner  of  Whiteacre  in  fee  simple,
leased Whiteacre to Ten for a term of ten years by a properly
executed  written  instrument.  The  lease  was  promptly  and
properly recorded. It contained an option for Ten to purchase
Whiteacre by tendering $250,000 as purchase price any time
“during  the  term  of  this  lease.”  One  year  later,  Ten,  by  a
properly executed written instrument, purported to assign the
option to Oscar, expressly retaining all of the remaining term
of the lease. The instrument of assignment was promptly and
properly recorded.
Two years later, Lanny contracted to sell Whiteacre to Jones
and to convey a marketable title “subject to the rights of Ten
under  her  lease.”  Jones  refused  to  close  because  of  the
outstanding option assigned to Oscar.

Lanny brought an appropriate action against Jones for specific
performance.

If judgment is rendered in favor of Lanny, it will be because
the relevant jurisdiction has adopted a rule on a key issue as
to which various state courts have split.

Which  of  the  following  identifies  the  determinative  rule  or
doctrine  upon  which  the  split  occurs,  and  states  the  position
favorable to Lanny?
(A)    In  a  contract  to  buy,  any  form  of  “subject  to  a  lease”
clause that fails to mention expressly an existing option
means that the seller is agreeing to sell free and clear of
any option originally included in the lease.

(B)    Marketable  title  can  be  conveyed  so  long  as  any
outstanding option not mentioned in the purchase contract
has not yet been exercised.

(C)    Options  to  purchase  by  lessees  are  subject  to  the  Rule

Against Perpetuities.

568

(D)    Options  to  purchase  contained  in  a  lease  cannot  be

assigned separately from the lease.

Answer  19:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Courts  disagree  about
whether  a  purchase  option  embodied  in  a  lease  may  be
assigned  independently  of  the  lease.  Since  Lanny  is  arguing
that his title is marketable, the position that purchase options
cannot be assigned independently of the lease is favorable to
Lanny (because that position, if upheld, would certainly mean
that Oscar could not exercise the option, and might even mean
that  Ten  had  rendered  the  option  invalid  by  purporting  to
assign it independently of the lease).

(A)  is  wrong  because,  even  if  the  contract’s  “subject  to  a
lease”  language  meant  what  this  choice  says  it  means  (that
Lanny  is  committing  to  sell  free  and  clear  of  any  option),
Lanny  would  still  lose:  He  would  not  in  fact  be  able  to  sell
free and clear of the purchase option now purportedly held by
Oscar.
(B)  is  wrong  because  the  existence  of  a  purchase  option
renders title unmarketable, even though the option has not yet
been exercised. (If the rule were otherwise, the buyer would
be paying full dollar for property that might be “called away”
from  him  by  exercise  of  the  option  at  any  time,  perhaps  at  a
below-market price.)

(C)  is  wrong  because:  (1)  purchase  options  embodied  in
leases  are  typically  not  subjected  to  the  Rule  against
Perpetuities;  and  (2)  even  if  the  option  here  were  subject  to
the  Rule,  the  option  would  not  thereby  be  rendered  invalid
(since the option must be exercised during the lease term, and
the lease terms falls within “lives in being plus 21 years”).

C.  Agreement by the parties about transfer

1.  Generally enforced

a.  Condemnation awards

Question 20: Six years ago, a landlord and a tenant entered
into  a  ten-year  commercial  lease  of  land.  The  written  lease
provided  that  if  a  public  entity  using  the  power  of  eminent
domain  condemned  any  part  of  the  land,  the  lease  would
the  entire
terminate  and 

landlord  would  receive 

the 

569

condemnation  award.  Thereafter, 
approximately two-thirds of the land.

the  city  condemned

The  tenant  notified  the  city  and  the  landlord  that  an
independent appraisal of the value of the tenant’s possessory
interest established that it substantially exceeded the tenant’s
obligation  under  the  lease  and  that  the  tenant  was  entitled  to
share 
the  award.  The  appraisal  was  accurate.  In  an
appropriate action among the landlord, the tenant, and the city
as  to  the  right  of  the  tenant  to  a  portion  of  the  condemnation
award, for whom will the court likely find?

(A)  The landlord, because the condemnation superseded and

canceled the lease.

(B)  The landlord, because the parties specifically agreed as

to the consequences of condemnation.

(C)  The tenant, because the landlord breached the landlord’s

implied warranty of quiet enjoyment.

(D)    The  tenant,  because  otherwise  the  landlord  would  be

unjustly enriched.

Answer  20:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  lease  between  the
landlord  and  the  tenant  specifically  addressed  what  would
happen if a public entity condemned any part of the land under
its  power  of  eminent  domain.  That  agreement  between  the
parties  controls.  Thus,  the  court  will  find  for  the  landlord:
The  lease  will  terminate  and  the  landlord  will  receive  the
entire condemnation award.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  specific  terms  of  the  lease
supersede  the  condemnation,  not  vice  versa.  If  the  lease  had
been  silent  on  the  issue  of  condemnation,  then  the  result
would  have  depended  on  whether  the  condemnation  was  of
all  the  property,  or  of  just  part.  (With  a  total  condemnation
and  a  lease  silent  on  this  point,  the  leasehold  and  all  the
tenant’s  duties  under  the  lease  would  have  been  terminated,
and  the  tenant  would  have  been  entitled  to  share  in  the
condemnation  award  only  to  the  extent  that  the  fair  market
value  of  his  leasehold  exceeded  his  obligations  under  the
lease.  Had  the  city  condemned  just  part  of  the  property,  in
most  courts  the  tenant  would  have  been  required  to  continue
paying the full rent, but would have been entitled to a portion

570

of the condemnation award to compensate him for the portion
of  the  leasehold  no  longer  available  to  him.)  However,  this
“default” rule for handling a condemnation award will, in all
courts, not be applied if the parties have specified a different
treatment, as they did here.

(C) is wrong because it misstates the law. The taking of all or
part of the leased land, or the taking of some interest in it — 
say  an  easement — by  eminent  domain  does  not  constitute  a
breach  of  the  landlord’s  covenant  of  quiet  enjoyment  of  the
premises because it occurs through no fault of the landlord.

(D)  is  wrong  because  there  has  been  no  unjust  enrichment.
Had  the  lease  not  provided  for  the  consequences  of
condemnation,  the  lease  would  have  remained  in  force,  and
the tenant would, to prevent unjust enrichment of the landlord,
have  gotten  either  a  pro-rata  reduction  of  rent,  some  portion
of the award (if the lease was below-market), or both. But the
fact that the parties expressly agreed that the landlord would
keep the entire award means that there is no unjust enrichment
when the agreed-upon outcome is enforced.

CHAPTER 6
EASEMENTS AND SERVITUDES

I.    CREATION OF EASEMENTS

A.  Easement by prescription

1.  Adverse use

Question 21: Oxnard owned Goldacre, a tract of land, in fee
simple.  At  a  time  when  Goldacre  was  in  the  adverse
possession  of  Amos,  Eric  obtained  the  oral  permission  of
Oxnard to use as a road or driveway a portion of Goldacre to
reach  adjoining  land,  Twin  Pines,  which  Eric  owned  in  fee
simple. Thereafter, during all times relevant to this problem,
Eric  used  this  road  between  Goldacre  regularly  for  ingress
and egress between Twin Pines and a public highway.
Amos  quit  possession  of  Goldacre  before  acquiring  title  by
adverse  possession.  Without  any  further  communication
between Oxnard and Eric, Eric continued to use the road for a
total period, from the time he first began to use it, sufficient to
acquire an easement by prescription. Oxnard then blocked the
road and refused to permit its continued use. Eric brought suit
to determine his right to continue use of the road. Eric should
(A)    win,  because  his  use  was  adverse  to  Amos  and  once
adverse  it  continued  adverse  until  some  affirmative
showing of a change.

(B)  win, because Eric made no attempt to renew permission

after Amos quit possession of Goldacre.

(C)  lose, because his use was with permission.
(D)    lose,  because  there  is  no  evidence  that  he  continued
adverse  use  for  the  required  period  after  Amos  quit
possession.

Answer  21:  Choice  (C)  is  correct,  because  it  correctly
identifies the reason Eric will lose: His use of Goldacre was
not  “adverse,”  i.e.,  non-permissive.  The  key  facts  here  are
that Eric had oral permission from Oxnard originally  to  use
the  road  across  Goldacre,  and  Amos  quit  possession  of
Goldacre before acquiring title by adverse possession. What

572

does  this  mean?  That  Eric’s  use  of  Goldacre  was  never
adverse to the interests of the landowner, and that Amos never
had  any  enforceable  rights  to  Goldacre.  In  order  to  gain  an
easement  by  prescription,  one’s  use  of  another’s  property
must  be  actual,  open  and  notorious,  continuous  for  the
statutory  period,  exclusive,  and  hostile  and  adverse  (non-
permissive).  Here,  the  facts  specifically  state  that  Eric  had
Oxnard’s  oral  permission  to  use  the  road  across  Goldacre.
The  red  herring  here  is  the  presence  of  Amos.  However,
Amos  is  merely  in  possession  of  Goldacre.  The  facts  state
that he quit possession before he acquired title to it. Thus, the
elements of an easement by prescription would apply to Eric
vis-à-vis Oxnard, not Eric vis-à-vis Amos.

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  focuses  on  the  wrong  fact.  Here,  it
doesn’t  matter  if  Eric’s  use  is  adverse  to  Amos,  because
Amos  is  not  the  landowner — Oxnard  is.  Eric’s  use  is  not
adverse to Oxnard, because the facts state that Oxnard granted
Eric  oral  permission  to  use  the  road  across  Goldacre.  An
easement  by  prescription  requires  use  of  another’s  property
that is actual, open and notorious, continuous for the statutory
period,  exclusive,  and  hostile  and  adverse.  “Hostile  and
adverse”  means  non-permissive  in  this  context.  Here,  since
Eric’s  use  was  with  the  permission  of  the  landowner  the
entire  time,  his  use  was  never  adverse.  Since  A  does  not
recognize this, it’s not the best response.

(B) is wrong because it falsely suggests that Amos’s quitting
possession  of  Goldacre  is  relevant.  It  is  not,  because  an
easement by prescription is gained by adverse use against the
landowner,  not  the  possessor.  Eric  could  only  gain  an
easement  by  prescription  if  his  use  of  Goldacre  as  against
Oxnard  was  actual,  open  and  notorious,  continuous  for  the
statutory period, exclusive, and non-permissive.
(D) is wrong because it focuses on a basically irrelevant fact.
What  matters  is  whether  Eric  had  the  requisite  open  and
hostile use as against the true owner, Oxnard. If Eric hadn’t
originally  gotten  permission  from  Oxnard,  his  time  of  use  of
the  driveway  while  Amos  was  in  adverse  possession  of  the
overall  tract  would  count  against  Oxnard.  So  the  problem  is
not that Eric didn’t use the driveway long enough once Amos

573

left,  it’s  that  Eric’s  entire  use  of  the  driveway  (even  when
Amos was there) wasn’t adverse as against Oxnard.

II.   SCOPE OF EASEMENTS

A.  Development of dominant estate

1.  Remedy for misuse is injunction or damages, not forfeiture

Question 22: A large tract of land was owned by a religious
order.  On  the  land,  the  order  erected  a  large  residential
building where its members reside. The land is surrounded by
rural  residential  properties  and  its  only  access  to  a  public
way  is  afforded  by  an  easement  over  a  strip  of  land  30  feet
wide. The easement was granted to the order by deed from a
the  adjacent  residential
neighbor,  who  owned  one  of 
properties.  The  order  built  a  driveway  on  the  strip,  and  the
easement was used for 20 years without incident or objection.
Last  year,  as  permitted  by  the  applicable  zoning  ordinance,
the  order  constructed  a  200-bed  nursing  home  and  a  parking
lot on their land, using all of the land that was available for
such  development.  The  nursing  home  was  very  successful,
and  on  Sundays  visitors  to  the  nursing  home  overflowed  the
parking  facilities  on  the  land  and  parked  all  along  the
driveway from early in the morning through the evening hours.
After 
resulting  congestion  and
the 
inconvenience,  the  neighbor  erected  a  barrier  across  the
driveway on Sundays preventing any use of the driveway by
anyone  seeking  access  to  the  order’s  land.  The  order
objected.

two  Sundays  of 

The  neighbor  brought  an  appropriate  action  to  terminate  the
easement.
The most likely result in this action is that the court will hold
for
(A)  the neighbor, because the order excessively expanded the

use of the dominant tenement.

(B)    the  neighbor,  because  the  parking  on  the  driveway

exceeded the scope of the easement.

(C)  the order, because expanded use of the easement does not

terminate the easement.

574

(D)  the order, because the neighbor’s use of self help denies

her the right to equitable relief.

Answer 22: Choice (C) is correct. The expanded use of the
easement here — especially the parking along the driveway at
all  hours — probably  does  represent  excessive  use  going
beyond the intended scope of the easement. However, a court
would  almost  certainly  limit  the  remedy  to  an  injunction
against  further  violations,  or  to  damages  for  the  two  past
violations, and would not order a forfeiture of the easement.
That’s  because  forfeitures  are  drastic  remedies,  and  will  be
awarded  in  excessive-use  situations  only  if  no  other  remedy
will  be  adequate,  which  would  not  be  the  case  for  the
violations here.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  while  the  order  has  indeed  probably
excessively  expanded  their  use  of  the  easement,  the  court
would  not  order  the  easement  forfeited  as  a  remedy,  for  the
reasons stated above.
(B) is wrong for the same reason (A) is wrong.
(D) is wrong because a court would not grant the neighbor the
extreme remedy of forfeiture whether or not she had used self-
help.

III.  REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF

EASEMENTS

A.  Dominant owner’s rights

Question 23: Two adjacent, two-story, commercial buildings
were  owned  by  a  landowner.  The  first  floors  of  both
buildings were occupied by various retail establishments. The
second floors were rented to various other tenants. Access to
the second floor of each building was reached by a common
stairway  located  entirely  in  Building  l.  While  the  buildings
were being used in this manner, the landowner sold Building
1 to an accountant by warranty deed which made no mention
of  any  rights  concerning  the  stairway.  About  two  years  later
the  landowner  sold  Building  2  to  a  lawyer.  The  stairway
continued to be used by the occupants of both buildings. The
stairway became unsafe as a consequence of regular wear and

575

tear.  The  lawyer  entered  upon  the  accountant’s  building  and
began  the  work  of  repairing  the  stairway.  The  accountant
demanded  that  the  lawyer  discontinue  the  repair  work  and
vacate the accountant’s building. When the lawyer refused, the
accountant  brought  an  action  to  enjoin  the  lawyer  from
continuing the work.

Judgment should be for

(A)    the  accountant,  because  the  lawyer  has  no  rights  in  the

stairway.

(B)  the accountant, because the lawyer’s rights in the stairway
do  not  extend  beyond  the  normal  life  of  the  existing
structure.

(C)    the  lawyer,  because  the  lawyer  has  an  easement  in  the
stairway  and  an  implied  right  to  keep  the  stairway  in
repair.

(D)    the  lawyer,  because  the  lawyer  has  a  right  to  take
whatever  action  is  necessary  to  protect  himself  from
possible tort liability to persons using the stairway.
Answer  23:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  At  the  time  of  the
conveyance  by  the  landowner  to  the  lawyer,  the  lawyer
received  an  implied  easement  to  use  the  stairs  for  access  to
Building  2.  (The  three  requirements  for  an  easement  by
implication were met here: (1) the land was “severed” from
common  ownership  when  the  landowner  kept  Building  2
while  selling  Building  1;  (2)  the  use  of  the  stairway  for
access to Building 2 existed prior to this severance; and (3)
the easement was and is reasonably necessary to enjoyment of
Building 2.) The holder of the easement (the lawyer) therefore
had  an  implied  right  to  maintain  the  property  used  in  the
easement, given that the maintenance was compatible with the
intended  use  of  the  easement  and  did  not  unreasonably
interfere  with  the  servient  owner’s  (the  accountant’s)  use  of
the servient estate.
(A)  is  wrong  because  the  lawyer  does  have  rights  in  the
stairway, namely an implied easement.
(B) is wrong because the lawyer as easement holder has the
right  to  maintain  or  repair  the  structure  indefinitely,  not  just
for the normal life of the original staircase.

576

(D) is wrong because it misstates the reason for the lawyer’s
repair right, which is that the lawyer has an implied easement;
if  the  lawyer  did  not  have  an  implied  easement,  he  would
probably  not  face  tort  liability  for  failing  to  correct  the
stairway  danger  on  property  belonging  to  another,  at  least  if
he  asked  the  owner  (the  accountant)  to  do  the  work  and  the
owner refused.

Question 24: Maria is the owner and possessor of Goodacre,
on which there is a lumber yard. Maria conveyed to Reliable
Electric Company the right to construct and use an overhead
electric  line  across  Goodacre  to  serve  other  properties.  The
conveyance was in writing, but the writing made no provision
concerning the responsibility for repair or maintenance of the
line. Reliable installed the poles and erected the electric line
in  a  proper  and  workmanlike  manner.  Neither  Maria  nor
Reliable  took  any  steps  toward  the  maintenance  or  repair  of
the  line  after  it  was  built.  Neither  party  complained  to  the
other  about  any  failure  to  repair.  Because  of  the  failure  to
repair  or  properly  maintain  the  line,  it  fell  to  the  ground
during a storm. In doing so, it caused a fire in the lumber yard
and  did  considerable  damage.  Maria  sued  Reliable  Electric
Company  to  recover  for  damages  to  the  lumber  yard.  The
decision should be for

(A)  Maria, because the owner of an easement has a duty to so
maintain 
to  avoid  unreasonable
interference with the use of the servient tenement by its
lawful possessor.

the  easement  as 

(B)    Maria,  because  the  owner  of  an  easement  is  absolutely
liable for any damage caused to the servient tenement by
the exercise of the easement.

(C)  Reliable Electric Company, because the possessor of the
servient tenement has a duty to give the easement holder
notice of defective conditions.

(D)    Reliable  Electric  Company,  because  an  easement
holder’s right to repair is a right for his own benefit, and
is  therefore  inconsistent  with  any  duty  to  repair  for  the
benefit of another.

Answer 24: Choice (A) is correct. Reliable has an expressly-
created easement for constructing and using overhead electric

577

lines. Since Reliable was given the right to use Maria’s land,
it’s  the  “dominant”  tenement  holder  (and  Maria  is  the
“servient” tenement holder, since it’s her land that’s burdened
by  the  easement).  The  rule  on  maintaining  easements  is  that
the dominant tenement holder has both the right and the duty
to  use  reasonable  care  to  maintain  the  easement.  Thus,
Reliable  would  have  the  right  to  enter  Maria’s  land  and
repair  the  line  and  poles,  as  necessary,  and  Maria  could  not
object  to  this  interference.  However,  Reliable  also  had  the
duty to use reasonable care to maintain the equipment so it did
not  pose  an  unreasonable  danger  to  Maria’s  land,  and  the
utility, by failing to maintain the line at all, did not fulfill that
duty. As a result, Maria will be able to recover for damages
to the lumber yard.

(B) is wrong because although it arrives at the correct result,
it misstates the responsibility of the dominant tenement holder.
There  is  no  doctrine  that  states  that  an  easement  owner  is
strictly liable for damage caused to the servient tenement by
the  exercise  of  the  easement.  Instead,  the  dominant  holder
merely  has  the  obligation  to  use  reasonable  care  to  maintain
the  easement  in  such  a  way  that  it  does  not  damage  the
servient  property.  If  the  accident  had  happened  without  the
lack  of  due  care  by  Reliable  (which  is  not  the  way  it
happened), Reliable would not be liable to Maria.
(C)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  duty  of  the  servient
tenement  holder,  and  arrives  at  the  wrong  result.  In  general,
the dominant holder has the obligation to use reasonable care
to maintain the easement so that it does not pose unreasonable
risk  to  the  servient  parcel.  This  obligation  includes  an
obligation to inspect. So the mere fact that Maria didn’t give
notice  of  the  problem  doesn’t  save  Reliable  from  liability.
(Indeed,  an  electric  utility  ought  to  be  able  to  recognize
maintenance issues more easily than a non-utility customer.)
(D) is wrong because it fails to recognize Reliable Electric’s
duty  to  Maria.  The  holder  of  an  easement  has  both  the  right
and  the  duty  to  take  reasonable  steps  to  maintain  the
easement.

1.  Limited right to contribution

578

Question 25: Beach owned a tract of land called Blackacre.
An  old  road  ran  through  Blackacre  from  the  abutting  public
highway.  The  road  had  been  used  to  haul  wood  from
Blackacre.  Without  Beach’s  permission  and  with  no  initial
right,  Daniel,  the  owner  of  Whiteacre,  which  adjoined
Blackacre, traveled over the old road for a period of 15 years
to  obtain  access  to  Whiteacre,  although  Whiteacre  abutted
another public road. Occasionally, Daniel made repairs to the
old road.

The  period  of  time  to  acquire  rights  by  prescription  in  the
jurisdiction is ten years.

After the expiration of 15 years, Beach conveyed a portion of
Blackacre to Carrol. The deed included the following clause:
“together with the right to pass and repass at all times and for
all purposes over the old road.” Carrol built a house fronting
on  the  old  road.  After  the  conveyance,  Beach  has  used  the
road  once  or  twice  per  year.  Daniel  almost  never  uses  the
road anymore.

The road was severely damaged by a spring flood, and Carrol
made substantial repairs to the road. Carrol asked Daniel and
Beach to contribute one-third each to the cost of repairing the
flood  damage.  They  both  refused,  and  Carrol  brought  an
appropriate  action  to  compel  contribution  from  Beach  and
Daniel.

In this action, Carrol will

(A)  lose as to both defendants.
(B)  win as to both defendants.
(C)  win as to Beach, but lose as to Daniel.
(D)  win as to Daniel, but lose as to Beach.
Answer 25: Choice (A) is correct. Carrol is the owner of the
dominant  tenement  (i.e.,  the  owner  of  the  easement),  and
Beach  is  the  owner  of  the  servient  tenement.  Beach,  as  the
servient  owner,  has  no  obligation  to  contribute  one-third  of
Carrol’s 
repair  expenditures.  Beach  may  have  some
obligation  of  reimbursement,  based  on  the  intensity  and
frequency of his bridge use versus Carrol’s, but certainly not
a one-third-of-total-cost obligation, since Beach clearly does
not represent one-third of the total usage of the bridge. As to

579

Daniel,  he  may  well  have  obtained  an  easement  by
prescription.  But  even  if  he  has  done  so,  he,  too,  has  no
obligation  to  reimburse  Carrol  for  one-third  of  the  latter’s
expenditures, because Daniel, like Beach, rarely makes use of
the bridge, and has at most an obligation to reimburse for his
small pro rata share of total usage.

Choices  (B),  (C),  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  they  are
inconsistent with the above analysis.

IV.  TRANSFER AND SUBDIVISION OF

EASEMENTS

A.  Transfer of benefit

1.  Transfer of easements appurtenant

a.  Deed to dominant parcel is silent

Question 26:  Olwen  owned  80  acres  of  land,  fronting  on  a
town  road.  Two  years  ago,  Olwen  sold  to  Buck  the  back  40
acres.  The  40  acres  sold  to  Buck  did  not  adjoin  any  public
road. Olwen’s deed to Buck expressly granted a right-of-way
over a specified strip of Olwen’s retained 40 acres, so Buck
could  reach  the  town  road.  The  deed  was  promptly  and
properly recorded.
Last year, Buck conveyed the back 40 acres to Sam. They had
discussed the right-of-way over Olwen’s land to the road, but
Buck’s deed to Sam made no mention of it. Sam began to use
the right-of-way as Buck had, but Olwen sued to enjoin such
use by Sam.

The court should decide for
(A)  Sam, because he has an easement by implication.
(B)  Sam, because the easement appurtenant passed to him as a

result of Buck’s deed to him.

(C)    Olwen,  because  Buck’s  easement  in  gross  was  not

transferable.

(D)  Olwen, because Buck’s deed failed expressly to transfer

the right-of-way to Sam.

Answer 26: Choice (B) is correct. What we have here is an

580

easement appurtenant, because the easement is for the benefit
of  a  particular  parcel  (the  back  40  acres).  An  easement
appurtenant passes to the new holder of the dominant tenement
automatically, even if the deed to the dominant tenement does
not mention the easement.

(A)  is  wrong,  because  the  easement  here  is  an  express
easement,  not  one  by  implication.  Furthermore,  even  if  the
easement  here  were  an  easement  by  implication,  it  would
automatically pass together with the dominant tenement.

(C) is wrong because the easement here is appurtenant, not in
gross. That is, it is clear from the surrounding circumstances
that the easement is being used to benefit a particular parcel
(the back 40 acres), not to benefit Buck irrespective of Buck’s
ownership  of  those  40  acres.  So  while  many  courts  indeed
hold  that  an  easement  in  gross  is  not  transferable  if  the
document creating it is silent on the issue, this principle won’t
apply to the facts here.

(D)  is  wrong  because,  as  described  in  the  answer  to  (B)
above,  an  easement  appurtenant  will  pass  together  with  the
dominant  tenement,  even  if  the  deed  conveying  the  dominant
tenement does not mention the easement.

V.   LICENSES

A.  Definition

1.  Oral agreement must produce a license, not an easement

Question  27:  A 
landowner  orally  gave  his  neighbor
permission  to  share  the  use  of  the  private  road  on  the
landowner’s  land  so  that  the  neighbor  could  have  more
convenient access to the neighbor’s land. Only the landowner
maintained the road. After the neighbor had used the road on a
daily basis for three years, the landowner conveyed his land
to  a  grantee,  who  immediately  notified  the  neighbor  that  the
neighbor  was  not  to  use  the  road.  The  neighbor  sued  the
grantee seeking a declaration that the neighbor had a right to
continue to use the road.

Who is likely to prevail?
(A)  The grantee, because an oral license is invalid.

581

(B)  The grantee, because the neighbor had a license that the

grantee could terminate at any time.

(C)    The  neighbor,  because  the  grantee  is  estopped  to

terminate the neighbor’s use of the road.

(D)  The neighbor, because the neighbor’s use of the road was
open and notorious when the grantee purchased the land.
Answer 27: Choice (B) is correct. A license is permission to
use the land of another. It is ordinarily revocable, and is not
subject  to  the  Statute  of  Frauds.  In  this  case,  because  the
neighbor had the landowner’s permission to use the road and
did not expend any money, property, or labor pursuant to the
agreement  (i.e.,  the  neighbor  did  substantially  rely  on  the
continued  availability  of  the  license),  the  neighbor  had  a
license  that  was  revocable — and  effectively  revoked — by
the grantee.

(A)  is  incorrect  because,  while  this  option  correctly  states
that the grantee will prevail, it misstates the reason why this
is  so.  A  license  (unlike  an  easement)  is  not  subject  to  the
Statute of Frauds; it may be oral, written, or implied.
(C)  is  incorrect  because  for  estoppel  to  apply  to  make  a
license  (which  is  ordinarily  revocable)  irrevocable,  the
neighbor  must  have  expended  money,  property,  or  labor
pursuant  to  the  agreement.  In  this  case,  the  landowner  alone
maintained  the  road.  The  neighbor’s  use  of  the  land  by
permission,  without  expense,  was  therefore  a  revocable
license that was effectively revoked by the grantee.

(D)  is  incorrect.  An  open  and  notorious  use  of  the  road
suggests  a  claim  for  an  easement  by  prescription.  However,
the  use  was  with  permission,  which  prevents  a  prescriptive
claim.  (Also,  the  use  was  for  just  three  years,  making  it
extremely  unlikely  that  the  statutory  period  for  adverse
possession-type  claims  could  have 
the
neighbor’s use of the land was a license that was effectively
revoked by the grantee.

Instead, 

run.) 

VI.  EQUITABLE SERVITUDES/RESTRICTIVE

COVENANTS

582

A.  Intent to benefit plaintiff’s parcel

Question  28:  A  landowner  owned  a  large  tract  of  land.
During the landowner’s lifetime, he conveyed the eastern half
of  the  tract  to  his  son,  and  the  western  half  to  his  daughter.
The  two  halves  of  the  tract  were  located  in  different
the  conveyances,  which  were
municipalities.  Each  of 
promptly  and  properly  recorded,  contained  the  following
language:

                              The parties agree for themselves and their heirs and assigns that the premises herein conveyed shall
be used only for residential purposes; that each lot created within the premises herein conveyed
shall contain not less than five acres; and that each lot shall have not more than one single-family
dwelling. This agreement shall bind all successor owners of all or any portion of the tract, and
any owner of any part of the tract may enforce this covenant.

After  the  landowner’s  death,  the  landowner’s  son  desired  to
build  houses  on  one-half  acre  lots  in  his  half  of  the  tract,  as
authorized by current applicable zoning and building codes in
its  municipality.  The  area  surrounding  the  son’s  half  of  the
tract  was  developed  as  a  residential  community  with  homes
built on one-half acre lots. The western half of the tract was
in  a  residential  area  covered  by  a  zoning  code  that  allowed
residential development only on five-acre tracts of land. In an
appropriate action brought by the daughter to enjoin the son’s
proposed  construction  on  one-half  acre  lots,  the  court  will
find the quoted restriction to be

(A)    invalid,  because  of  the  change  of  circumstance  in  the

neighborhood.

(B)    invalid,  because  it  conflicts  with  the  applicable  zoning

code.

(C)  valid, but only so long as the original grantees from the

landowner own their respective tracts.

(D)    valid,  because  the  provision  imposed  an  equitable

servitude.

Answer  28:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Where  a  promise
regarding  land  use  is  a  negative  one — i.e.,  one  forbidding
certain uses — the promise is called an “equitable servitude.”
An  equitable  servitude  is  not  enforceable  by  the  owner  of  a
particular  parcel  unless  the  original  parties  intended  to
benefit that particular parcel. The language in the deeds from

583

the  landowner  to  his  son  and  from  the  landowner  to  his
daughter specifically provided that “any owner of any part of
the  tract  may  enforce  the  covenant”;  the  fact  that  the
daughter’s parcel was part of the tract shows that that parcel
was  intended  to  be  benefitted  by  the  restriction.  Since  the
daughter’s  parcel  was  intended  to  be  benefitted,  and  since
equitable  servitudes  are  generally  enforceable,  the  daughter
wins.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  change  in  local  land  use  does  not
mean that the court will not enforce the servitude. There can
be  extreme  circumstances  in  which  a  change  of  land  use
throughout  an  entire  neighborhood  might  lead  a  court  to
conclude  that  it  should  no  longer  enforce  an  equitable
servitude;  but  the  mere  fact  that  uses  inconsistent  with  the
servitude are now prevalent in adjacent parcels would not be
enough.  That’s  especially  true  where,  as  here,  some  of  the
parcels near plaintiff (i.e., any parcel on the western side of
the  municipal  line)  are  used  in  a  way  that  is  consistent  with
the restriction.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  the  fact  that  a  use  forbidden  by  a
servitude  is  allowed  by  local  zoning  codes  won’t  cause  a
court  to  refuse  enforcement  of  an  otherwise  valid  restriction
unless the entire area in question has changed in such a way
that enforcement would be of little value. So where, as here,
use patterns on the western side are still five-acre minimums,
the fact that the zoning code applicable to the eastern side is
inconsistent  with  five-acre-minimums  would  not  induce  the
court to relax the enforcement of the servitude.

(C)  is  wrong,  because  courts  will  enforce  an  equitable
servitude  against  a  subsequent  owner  of  burdened  land  who
took with actual or constructive notice. So if, for instance, the
son  sold  to  a  buyer,  that  buyer  would  be  deemed  to  have
constructive notice of the restriction (it’s in her chain of title).
Consequently, 
landowner’s  daughter  could  get  an
injunction against the buyer even though the buyer was not an
“original grantee.”

the 

B.  Running of benefit and burden

Question 29: A landowner owned five adjoining, rectangular

584

lots,  numbered  1  through  5  inclusive,  all  fronting  on  Main
Street. All of the lots are in a zone limited to one- and two-
family residences under the zoning ordinance. Two years ago,
the  landowner  conveyed  Lots  1,  3,  and  5.  None  of  the  three
deeds  contained  any  restrictions.  Each  of  the  new  owners
built a one-family residence.

One year ago, the landowner conveyed Lot 2 to a developer.
The  deed  provided  that  each  of  the  developer  and  the
landowner,  as  well  as  their  respective  heirs  and  assigns,
would  use  Lots  2  and  4  respectively  only  for  one-family,
residential  purposes.  The  deed  was  promptly  and  properly
recorded. The developer built a one-family residence on Lot
2.  Last  month,  the  landowner  conveyed  Lot  4  to  an  investor.
The  deed  contained  no  restrictions.  The  deed  from  the
landowner  to  the  developer  was  in  the  title  report  examined
by  the  investor’s  lawyer.  The  investor  obtained  a  building
permit  and  commenced  construction  of  a 
two-family
residence  on  Lot  4.  The  developer,  joined  by  the  owners  of
Lots  1,  3,  and  5,  brought  an  appropriate  action  against  the
investor to enjoin the proposed use of Lot 4, or, alternatively,
damages caused by the investor’s breach of covenant. Which
is  the  most  appropriate  comment  concerning  the  outcome  of
this action?
(A)  All plaintiffs should be awarded their requested judgment
for injunction because there was a common development
scheme, but award of damages should be denied to all.

(B)  The developer should be awarded an appropriate remedy,

but recovery by the other plaintiffs is doubtful.

(C)    Injunction  should  be  denied,  but  damages  should  be
awarded  to  all  plaintiffs,  measured  by  diminution  of
market value, if any, suffered as a result of the proximity
of the investor’s two-family residence.

(D)    All  plaintiffs  should  be  denied  any  recovery  or  relief
because  the  zoning  preempts  any  private  scheme  of
covenants.

Answer 29: Choice (B)  is  correct.  The  plaintiff  owner  of  a
parcel  can’t  gain  enforcement  of  either  a  covenant  at  law  or
an  inequitable  servitude  against  a  defendant  who  is  the
“downstream” owner of a burdened parcel (i.e., one who took

585

after the burden was imposed), unless: (1) there was an intent
by the original parties to benefit the parcel now owned by the
plaintiff; and (2) the defendant was on actual or constructive
notice of the nature of the restriction at the time she took. In
the case of the suit by the developer on behalf of Lot 2, both
of  these  requirements  are  satisfied:  (1)  the  landowner-to-
developer  deed  made  it  clear  that  both  Lots  2  and  4  were
being  both  burdened  and  benefited  by  mutual  single-family-
only  restrictions  (so  the  requisite  intent  to  benefit  Lot  2  is
present);  and  (2)  the  investor  was  on  constructive  (and
probably  actual)  notice  of  the  restriction  on  the  lot  she  was
buying at the time she bought because it was mentioned in the
landowner-to-developer  deed  that  was  part  of  the  investor’s
title report (and, indeed, from this the investor knew that that
restriction  was  intended  to  benefit  Lot  2).  Therefore,  the
developer will likely be entitled to his choice of an injunction
and  damages  (i.e.,  to  recover  on  the  equitable  servitude  or,
alternatively, for breach of covenant at law).

The  owners  of  Lots  1,  3,  and  5,  by  contrast,  cannot  satisfy
either  of  these  requirements:  (1)  nothing  indicates  that  at  the
time  the  landowner  conveyed  these  three  lots,  he  was
intending (then or ever) to create any equitable restrictions on
any  of  his  five  lots,  so  the  present  owners  of  the  three  lots
cannot  show  that  their  parcels  were  ever  intended  to  be
benefited; and (2) the investor, at the time she took, was not
on  notice  that  Lots  1,  3,  and  5  were  to  be  benefited  by  any
restriction on the parcel she was buying. So these owners are
unlikely to get any relief against the investor.

(A)  is  wrong  because  there  was  no  common  development
scheme at the time Lots 1, 3, and 5 were conveyed. It’s true
that had there been in place, at the time Lots 1, 3, and 5 were
conveyed,  a  “plan  of  development”  (say,  a  filed  subdivision
plat) showing an intent to keep the whole development single-
family  residential,  the  owners  of  Lots  1,  3,  and  5  might
succeed with an “implied reciprocal servitude” argument, that
the landowner implicitly promised them that he’d burden his
remaining lots consistently with this plan and that the investor
should have known of this promise and be required to honor
it.  But  the  facts  do  not  indicate  that  any  such  plan  existed  at

586

the time the landowner sold Lots 1, 3, and 5.

(C) is wrong because, as noted in the analysis of Choice (B),
owners cannot recover damages (i.e., recover on a covenant
at law) unless they can show that there was an intent to give
their  parcels  the  benefit  of  the  restrictive  promise,  an  intent
which  is  absent  as  to  Lots  1,  3,  and  5.  The  fact  that  the
landowner  later  developed  such  a  purpose  to  burden  his
remaining lots doesn’t help — there must have been an intent-
to-burden at the time when the landowner still owned the lots
in question.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  existence  of  a  zoning  scheme  that
allows the activity in question doesn’t trump a stricter scheme
of  covenants.  If  the  zoning  scheme  was  stricter,  it  would
prevail  (landowners  can’t  by  mutual  agreement  cause  strict
zoning  rules  to  be  relaxed).  But  the  converse  is  not  true — 
indeed, the whole idea of restrictive covenants is that they can
be used to forbid uses that are allowed by the zoning rules.

to  build  and  maintain  within 

Question  30:  A  realty  company  developed  a  residential
development,  which  included  single-family  dwellings,  town
houses,  and  high-rise  apartments  for  a  total  of  25,000
dwelling units.
Included in the deed to each unit was a covenant under which
the  grantee  and  the  grantee’s  ‘‘heirs  and  assigns’’  agreed  to
purchase  electrical  power  only  from  a  plant  the  realty
company  promised 
the
development.  The  realty  company  constructed  the  plant  and
the  necessary  power  lines.  The  plant  did  not  supply  power
outside the development. An appropriate and fair formula was
used to determine price. After constructing and selling 12,500
of  the  units,  the  realty  company  sold  its  interest  in  the
development to an investor. The investor operated the power
plant  and  constructed  and  sold  the  remaining  12,500  units.
Each  conveyance  from  the  investor  contained  the  same
covenant relating to electrical power that the realty company
had  included  in  the  12,500  conveyances  it  had  made.  A
woman bought a dwelling unit from its former resident, who
had  purchased  it  from  the  realty  company.  Subsequently,  the
woman,  whose 
the
development,  ceased  buying  electrical  power  from  the

the  boundary  of 

lot  was  along 

587

in 

investor and began purchasing power from an outside electric
company,  which  provided  such  service 
the  area
surrounding  the  development.  Both  the  electric  company  and
the  investor  have  governmental  authorization  to  provide
electrical  services  to  the  area.  The  investor  instituted  an
appropriate  action  against  the  woman  to  enjoin  her  from
obtaining electrical power from the outside electric company.
Assume  that  the  jurisdiction  follows  the  traditional  rule  for
the running of covenants. If judgment is for the woman, it most
likely will be because

(A)  the covenant does not touch and concern the land.
(B)    the  mixture  of  types  of  residential  units  is  viewed  as

preventing one common development scheme.

(C)  the covenant is a restraint on alienation.
(D)  there is no privity of estate between the woman and the

investor.

Answer  30:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  covenant  here  is
ostensibly  a  ‘‘real’’  covenant,  which  is  a  promise  related  to
land  that  is  enforceable  by  (and  against)  subsequent  holders
of the land. Traditionally, for a covenant to be “real” (i.e., to
be enforceable by and against subsequent landholders) (1) the
original parties must have intended that the covenant run with
the land, (2) the covenant must “touch and concern” the land,
(3) the Statute of Frauds must be satisfied, and (4) privity of
estate  must  exist.  Choice  A  correctly  focuses  on  the  touch-
and-concern  requirement.  A  covenant  does  not  touch  and
concern the land if it doesn’t change the value, use, or utility
of the land. Most typically, covenants that touch and concern
the  land  are  building  restrictions,  although  even  payments  to
homeowner’s  associations  can  qualify.  However,  a  mere
agreement  to  purchase  electricity  from  the  realty  company’s
facility  would  traditionally  not  be  considered  to  touch  and
concern  the  residential  owner’s  land;  therefore,  it  couldn’t
‘‘run with’’ the land, and, as a result, the woman would not be
bound  by  it  without  her  personally  covenanting  to  do  so.
Since,  of  the  four  answer  choices  presented,  Choice  A
correctly identifies the most likely basis on which the woman
will  prevail,  it’s  the  best  response.  (Note  that,  under  the
modern  trend,  as  represented  by  §  3.2  of  the  Third

588

Restatement  (Servitudes),  the  covenant  need  not  fulfill  the
touch-and-concern  requirement  in  order  to  run.  But  you’re
told that the jurisdiction follows the “traditional rule” for the
running  of  covenants,  and  touch-and-concern  is  part  of  the
traditional set of rules.)

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  law,  and,  in  any  case,
does correctly characterize these facts. The covenant here, if
it  is  enforceable  at  all,  is  a  “real  covenant,”  whose
requirements are summarized in the discussion of Choice (A)
above. The requirement to which Choice (B) refers is not for
a real covenant, but for an “implied reciprocal servitude.” An
implied  reciprocal  servitude  is  a  means  by  which  a
subsequent property owner can be bound by a covenant that is
not  present  in  his  own  deed  (or  in  the  deed  of  his
predecessor(s)),  but  that  is  present  in  deeds  from  the  same
grantor  to  prior  purchasers  of  different  parcels,  typically  in
the  same  subdivision.  That  isn’t  the  case  here,  since  the
covenant  appeared  in  the  deed  to  the  woman’s  predecessor.
So  there  is  no  place  for  the  doctrine  of  implied  reciprocal
servitudes. In any case, even if the doctrine applied, the fact
that  not  all  the  dwellings  were  of  the  same  type  would  not
prevent a common development scheme from existing.
(C) is wrong, because it does not focus on the correct issue,
and,  in  any  case,  misstates  the  law.  Restraints  on  alienation
are not per se invalid; for instance, promissory restraints are
valid,  as  in  the  case  of  prohibitions  against  subletting  and
assignment  in  landlord-tenant  agreements.  Restraints  are
viewed narrowly by courts, but they can be valid. While the
covenant here would be a restraint on alienation, it would not
be  invalid  for  that  reason,  since  if  the  covenant  touched  and
concerned  the  land,  it  would  be  enforceable  as  a  ‘‘real’’
covenant.
(D)  is  wrong,  because  it  is  factually  incorrect.  There  is
privity  between  the  woman  and  the  investor,  because  most
states hold that privity exists if both interests ultimately come
from  a  common  grantor  (here,  the  realty  company).  Instead,
the  problem  here 
touch-and-concern  element
traditionally  required  for  a  real  covenant,  as  discussed  in
Choice A.

1.  Requirement of notice

Question  31:  In  2000,  Oscar,  owner  of  a  100-acre  tract,
prepared and duly recorded a subdivision plan called Happy
Acres. The plan showed 100 one-acre lots, and said that these
lots would be “single-family, no mobile homes allowed.”

In  2001,  Oscar  sold  60  of  the  lots  to  individual  purchasers.
Each  deed  referred  to  the  recorded  plan  and  also  contained
the following clause: “No mobile homes shall be erected on
any  lot  within  Happy  Acres.”  Sarah  was  one  of  the  original
purchasers from Oscar.

In 2006, Oscar sold the remaining 40 lots to Max by a deed
which  referred  to  the  plan  and  contained  the  restriction
relating to mobile homes. Max sold the 40 lots to individual
purchasers,  whose  deeds  from  Max  did  not  include  the
mobile-home  restriction.  One  of  those  purchasers  was  Joe,
who did not know of the no-mobile-homes restriction in any
prior  deeds  within  Happy  Acres.  Joe  then  placed  a  mobile
home  on  his  lot.  Sarah  now  brings  an  action  against  Joe  to
force him to remove the mobile home. The result of this action
will be in favor of

(A)  Sarah, because the restrictive covenant in her deed runs

with the land.

(B)    Sarah,  because  the  presence  of  the  mobile  home  may

adversely affect the market value of her land.

(C)    Joe,  because  his  deed  did  not  contain  the  restrictive

covenant.

(D)    Joe,  because  he  is  not  a  direct  but  a  remote  grantee  of

Oscar.

Answer  31:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  A  restrictive  covenant
will  normally  run  with  the  land,  i.e.,  be  enforceable  by
subsequent  grantees  of  the  benefitted  parcels,  and  against
subsequent  grantees  of  the  burdened  parcels,  if  the  original
parties  intended  that  it  run.  The  existence  of  the  filed
subdivision  plat  with  the  restriction,  and  the  fact  that  Oscar
took  the  trouble  to  insert  the  restriction  in  all  his  deeds,
establish  that  he  and  his  grantees  intended  the  burden  and
benefit  of  the  restriction  to  run.  Meanwhile,  Joe,  as  a
subsequent  grantee,  will  only  be  bound  by  the  restrictive

590

covenant  if  he  was  on  actual  or  constructive  notice  when  he
took.  “Constructive”  notice  includes  “record”  notice.  Here,
Joe  was  on  record  notice  of  the  restriction.  That’s  true
because  although  Joe’s  deed  did  not  itself  refer  to  the  no-
mobile-homes  restriction,  that  restriction  was  present  in  a
prior  recording  in  his  chain  of  title  (the  Oscar-Max  deed).
And  a  purchaser  is  deemed  to  be  on  record  notice  of  any
restrictions in his chain of title. Intuitively, this makes sense 
— Joe’s lawyer could have and should have found the Oscar-
to-Max  deed,  and  noticed  the  restriction.  (Or,  the  lawyer
could have and should have noticed that the lot was part of a
filed subdivision plat that contained the restriction.)

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  it  cites  is  irrelevant  to  the
issues here. The mere fact that the presence of mobile homes
would  adversely  affect  the  value  of  Sarah’s  land  does  not
mean that Sarah has a legally cognizable right to forbid their
presence. As a general principle, the owner of land may put
the  land  to  any  lawful  use  he  chooses,  without  regard  to  the
impact  on  the  market  value  of  other,  neighboring  properties.
Thus,  even  if  (B)  were  true,  it  would  not  provide  a  sound
basis for Sarah to prevail.

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  does  not  correctly  cite  the  rule  on
restrictive  covenants  (or  “equitable  servitudes,”  as  they  are
also  called).  Restrictive  covenants  will  bind  subsequent
purchasers of the land as long as the original parties intended
that the agreement will run with the land, and the subsequent
purchaser had actual or constructive notice of the restriction.
Here,  Joe  had  constructive  notice  (namely,  record  notice)  of
the restriction, as further explained in (A). Therefore, the fact
that Joe’s own deed did not contain the covenant is irrelevant.
(D) is wrong because as long as the restriction was intended
to run with the land, the fact that the person sought to be bound
is a remote grantee of the original, covenanting party — here,
Oscar — is  irrelevant.  That’s  what  the  fact  that  the  covenant
or  restriction  “runs  with  the  land”  means — the  restriction
binds  remote  grantees  who  take  with  actual  or  constructive
(including record) notice.

Question 32: Able, owner of Blackacre and Whiteacre, two
to  Baker  and
adjoining  parcels,  conveyed  Whiteacre 

591

covenanted  in  the  deed  to  Baker  that  when  he,  Able,  sold
Blackacre he would impose restrictive covenants to prohibit
uses  that  would  compete  with  the  filling  station  that  Baker
intended to construct and operate on Whiteacre. The deed was
not recorded.

Baker constructed and operated a filling station on Whiteacre
and  then  conveyed  Whiteacre  to  Dodd,  who  continued  the
filling  station  use.  The  deed  did  not  refer  to  the  restrictive
covenant and was promptly and properly recorded.

Able  then  conveyed  Blackacre  to  Egan,  who  knew  about
Able’s covenant with Baker to impose a covenant prohibiting
the
the  filling  station  use  but  nonetheless  completed 
transaction  when  he  noted  that  no  such  covenant  was
contained  in  Able’s  deed  to  him.  Egan  began  to  construct  a
filling station on Blackacre.

Dodd brought an appropriate action to enjoin Egan from using
Blackacre for filling station purposes.
If Dodd prevails, it will be because
(A)    Egan  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  covenant  to  impose

restrictions.

(B)  Egan is bound by the covenant because of the doctrine of

negative reciprocal covenants.

(C)  business-related restrictive covenants are favored in the

law.

(D)    Egan  has  constructive  notice  of  the  possibility  of  the

covenant resulting from the circumstances.

Answer  32:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Dodd  can  win  only  if
Egan is found to have been bound by Able’s promise to Baker
that  Able  would  impose  a  restriction  on  Blackacre  when  he
sold it. A subsequent purchaser of a use-restricted parcel can
be bound by the restriction only if he had some sort of notice
of the restriction at the time he took. Egan did not have record
notice  of  the  restriction  because  (1)  the  restriction  was  not
contained  in  the  Able-to-Egan  deed  by  which  Egan  took
Blackacre;  and  (2)  even  if  the  Able-to-Baker  deed  to
Whiteacre was held to be within Egan’s chain of title (which
it  wouldn’t  be),  that  wouldn’t  give  Egan  notice,  because  the
Able-to-Baker deed was not recorded, so Egan couldn’t have

592

discovered the restriction by tracing back title to Whiteacre in
the public records. Therefore, the only way Egan could have
received the required notice (and thus lose) is if he had actual
notice  or  some  form  of  constructive  notice  not  involving
record notice. (A), by referring specifically to Egan’s “actual
knowledge” of the restriction, is the only choice that satisfies
the  notice-to-Egan  requirement.  And  as  we  know  from  the
statement of facts, Egan indeed had such actual knowledge.

(B)  is  wrong  because,  while  the  doctrine  of  negative
reciprocal covenants might apply to restrict Whiteacre, Egan
wouldn’t be bound by that restriction if he didn’t have some
form  of  notice,  and  this  choice  does  not  refer  to  the  notice
problem.

(C)  is  wrong  because,  like  (B),  it  fails  to  refer  to  the  key
point, notice to Egan.

(D) is wrong because, while Egan might indeed lose if he had
constructive  notice  of  the  possibility  of  the  restriction,  such
constructive  notice  was  not  present  in  the  facts  here:  The
mere  fact  that  Able  sold  Whiteacre  to  Baker  and  that  Baker
put  a  filling  station  on  the  property  would  not  suggest  to  a
reasonable  purchaser  of  the  adjacent  Blackacre  parcel  that
Able would likely have restricted Blackacre by giving Baker
a non-compete. (Otherwise any purchaser of a commercially-
zoned  parcel  would  have  to  check  into  the  facts  surrounding
his seller’s sale of any other nearby parcel, to make sure that
the  seller  didn’t  give  a  non-compete,  too  large  a  burden  on
buyers to make sense.)

C.  Developer’s building plan

1.  Plan filed without restriction

Question  33:  A  fee-simple  landowner  lawfully  subdivided
his  land  into  10  large  lots.  The  recorded  subdivision  plan
imposed  no  restrictions  on  any  of  the  10  lots.  Within  two
months after recording the plan, the landowner conveyed Lot
1  to  a  buyer,  by  a  deed  that  contained  no  restriction  on  the
lot’s use. There was then a lull in sales. Two years later, the
real  estate  market  in  the  state  had  generally  improved  and,
during the next six months, the landowner sold and conveyed
eight of the remaining nine lots. In each of the eight deeds of

593

conveyance,  the  landowner  included  the  following  language:
“It is a term and condition of this conveyance, which shall be
a covenant running with the land for the benefit of each of the
10  lots  [with  an  appropriate  reference  to  the  recorded
subdivision plan], that for 15 years from the date of recording
of  the  plan,  no  use  shall  be  made  of  the  premises  herein
conveyed except for single-family residential purposes.” The
buyer  of  Lot  1  had  actual  knowledge  of  what  the  landowner
had done. The landowner included the quoted language in part
because  the  zoning  ordinance  of  the  municipality  had  been
amended  a  year  earlier  to  permit  professional  offices  in  any
residential  zone.  Shortly  after  the  landowner’s  most  recent
sale, when he owned only one unsold lot, the buyer of Lot 1
constructed a one-story house on Lot 1 and then conveyed Lot
1 to a doctor. The deed to the doctor contained no reference to
any restriction on the use of Lot 1. The doctor applied for an
appropriate  certificate  of  occupancy  to  enable  her  to  use  a
part of the house on Lot 1 as a medical office. The landowner,
on  behalf  of  himself  as  the  owner  of  the  unsold  lot,  and  on
behalf of the other lot owners, sued to enjoin the doctor from
carrying out her plans and to impose the quoted restriction on
Lot 1.

Who is likely to prevail?
(A)    The  doctor,  because  Lot  1  was  conveyed  without  the
inclusion  of  the  restrictive  covenant  in  the  deed  to  the
first buyer and the subsequent deed to the doctor.

(B)    The  doctor,  because  zoning  ordinances  override  private
restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy.
(C)    The  landowner,  because  the  doctor,  as  a  successor  in
interest to the first buyer, is estopped to deny that Lot 1
remains  subject  to  the  zoning  ordinance  as  it  existed
when Lot 1 was first conveyed by the landowner to the
first buyer.

(D)  The landowner, because with the first buyer’s knowledge
of  the  facts,  Lot  1  became  incorporated  into  a  common
scheme.

Answer  33:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  To  be  binding,  a
restrictive covenant must be placed on property at the time it
is conveyed. Here, neither the deed to the first buyer nor the

594

deed  to  the  doctor  contains  the  restrictive  covenant.  The
burden cannot be attached to Lot 1 at a later time by someone
who  has  no  interest  in  Lot  1,  even  if  that  person  (here,  the
landowner)  purports  to  be  acting  on  behalf  of  the  entire
subdivision. Therefore, the doctor may proceed with her plan
to use part of the property as a medical office.

(B)  is  incorrect,  because  although  this  option  correctly
concludes that the doctor will prevail, it misstates the reason
why  this  is  so.  Zoning  ordinances  do  not  automatically
override a private restrictive covenant. The stricter of either
the zoning ordinance or the covenant will prevail. In this case,
the  doctor  will  prevail  because  the  restrictive  covenant  was
not  in  the  deed  to  the  first  buyer  of  Lot  1,  nor  was  it  in  the
deed to the doctor.

(C) is incorrect. Public land use controls and private land use
controls  are  separate  issues.  Zoning  may  be  changed.  In  this
case,  the  zoning  was  changed  a  year  after  the  first  buyer
purchased Lot 1. The doctor’s use of Lot 1 is governed by the
zoning in existence during the time of the doctor’s ownership,
and  the  previous  zoning  of  the  property  is  irrelevant.  The
doctor may proceed with her plan to use part of the property
as a medical office, because the restrictive covenant was not
in the deed to the first buyer of Lot 1, nor was it in the deed to
the doctor.

(D) is incorrect. To be binding, a restrictive covenant must be
placed on property at the time when it is conveyed. The first
buyer’s learning of the covenant two years after he acquired it
is irrelevant, and does not incorporate Lot 1 into the common
scheme of the subdivision; nor does the actual knowledge of
any  subsequent  buyer  of  Lot  1  (even  knowledge  acquired
before he took) have any effect. A common-scheme argument
might prevail as to subsequent purchasers of other lots in the
subdivision who took from the landowner after the landowner
had already burdened other parcels with the restriction. As to
Lot 1, however, the doctor may proceed with her plan to use
part  of  the  property  as  a  medical  office,  because  the
restrictive covenant was not in the deed to the first buyer, nor
was it in the deed to the doctor.

VII. MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION OF

COVENANTS AND SERVITUDES

A.  Modification and termination generally

1.  Passage of time

Question 34:  A  grantor  owned  in  fee  simple  two  adjoining
lots,  Lots  1  and  2.  He  conveyed  in  fee  simple  Lot  1  to  an
investor. The deed was in usual form of a warranty deed with
the following provision inserted in the appropriate place:

                              Grantor, for himself, his heirs and assigns, does covenant and agree that any reasonable expense
incurred  by  grantee,  his  heirs  and  assigns,  as  the  result  of  having  to  repair  the  retaining  wall
presently situated on Lot 1 at the common boundary with Lot 2, shall be reimbursed one-half
the costs of repairs; and by this provision the parties intend a covenant running with the land.

The investor conveyed Lot 1 in fee simple to a housewife by
warranty  deed  in  usual  and  regular  form.  The  deed  omitted
any  reference  to  the  retaining  wall  or  any  covenant.  Fifty
years  after  the  grantor’s  conveyance  to  the  investor,  the
housewife  conveyed  Lot  1  in  fee  simple  to  a  student  by
warranty deed in usual form; this deed omitted any reference
to the retaining wall or the covenant.
There is no statute that applies to any aspect of the problems
presented  except  a  recording  act  and  a  statute  providing  for
acquisition of title after ten years of adverse possession.

All conveyances by deeds were for a consideration equal to
fair market value.

The deed from the grantor to the investor was never recorded.
All other deeds were promptly and properly recorded.

Lot  2  is  now  owned  by  the  grantor’s  son,  who  took  by
intestate succession from the grantor, now dead.
The  student  expended  $3,500  on  the  retaining  wall.  Then  he
obtained all of the original deeds in the chain from the grantor
to him. Shortly thereafter, the student discovered the covenant
in  the  grantor’s  deed  to  the  investor.  He  demanded  that  the
grantor’s  son  pay  $1,750,  and  when  the  son  refused,  the
student  instituted  an  appropriate  action  to  recover  that  sum
from  the  son.  In  such  action,  the  son  asserted  all  defenses
available to him.

596

If judgment is for the grantor’s son, it will be because

(A)  the student is barred by adverse possession.
(B)  the investor’s deed from the grantor was never recorded.
(C)  the student did not know about the covenant until after he
had  incurred  the  expenses  and,  hence,  could  not  have
relied on it.

(D)    the  student’s  expenditures  were  not  proved  to  be

reasonable and customary.

rendering 

fulfillment  of 

Answer  34:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  When  the  grantor
conveyed  Lot  1  to  the  investor,  the  grantor  burdened  Lot  2
with the covenant to reimburse the owner of Lot 1 for wall-
repair expenses. This covenant was enforceable, and ran with
the  land  on  both  the  burden  and  benefit  side.  Even  though
more than 50 years have passed, no event has occurred (e.g.,
change  of  circumstances 
the
covenant’s  purposes  impossible)  that  would  cause  the
covenant  to  be  extinguished,  and  the  mere  passage  of  time
does not suffice to end the covenant. The fact that the covenant
ran with the land on the benefit side means that the student as
present  owner  of  the  benefited  lot  gets  to  enforce  the
covenant; this running of the benefit side occurs even though
the deed to convey the benefited parcel to the student did not
mention  the  covenant  or  the  wall  (since  mention  of  the
covenant  in  the  deed  to  the  benefited  lot  is  simply  not  a
requirement). The running of the covenant on the burden side
means that the obligation of payment attached to the grantor’s
son’s interest in Lot 2. Therefore, the only way the student can
lose is if his expenditures were not reasonable and customary
(in which case they would not be covered by the terms of the
covenant, even though the covenant is still enforceable).
(A) is wrong because nothing occurred to cause the doctrine
of  adverse  possession  to  affect  title  to  the  benefited  lot  (Lot
1)  while  that  lot  was  held  by  either  the  investor,  the
housewife,  or  the  student.  For  instance,  no  action  by  any
owner  of  Lot  2  could  even  arguably  have  constituted  the
requisite  hostile,  notorious,  open,  and  continuous  possession
of the wall so as to wipe out the covenant governing repairs.
(B) is wrong because the fact that the investor’s deed from the

597

grantor  for  Lot  1  was  not  recorded  had  no  effect  on  anyone
who ever had an interest in Lot 2. It’s true that the grantor, by
conveying  Lot  1  to  the  investor,  simultaneously  created  a
covenant burdening Lot 2, which was an interest in Lot 2. But
a  grantee’s  failure  to  record  under  a  recording  act  has  no
effect  on  the  rights  as  between  the  original  grantor  and
grantee;  therefore,  in  a  contest  between  the  grantor  and  the
investor, the investor’s failure to record his covenant against
Lot  2  would  not  prevent  the  investor  from  recovering
reimbursement from the grantor while the grantor still owned
Lot  2.  The  interesting  question  is  whether  the  investor’s
failure  to  record  can  be  taken  advantage  of  by  the  grantor’s
son as the grantor’s successor. In other words, is the grantor’s
son  a  “subsequent  purchaser  without  notice”  who  can  take
advantage of the fact that the deed creating the covenant never
appeared  in  his  chain  of  title?  The  answer  is  that  because
recording acts invariably protect only “purchasers for value,”
and because the son took by intestate succession (and thus did
not give value for his interest), the son is not a purchaser for
value and thus cannot take advantage of the recording act. (If
the  son  had  purchased  for  value  and  without  notice  of  the
covenant, he would have been free of the covenant on account
of the investor’s failure to record.)

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  owner  of  a  parcel  benefited  by  an
affirmative covenant does not lose the benefit merely because
he did not act in reliance on the covenant’s existence.

CHAPTER 7
LAND SALE CONTRACTS, MORTGAGES,
AND DEEDS

I.    LAND SALE CONTRACTS

A.  Statute of Frauds

Question  35:  Ozzie  owned  and  occupied  Blackacre,  which
was  a  tract  of  land  improved  with  a  one-family  house.  His
friend, Victor, orally offered Ozzie $50,000 for Blackacre, the
fair  market  value,  and  Ozzie  accepted.  Because  they  were
friends,  they  saw  no  need  for  attorneys  or  written  contracts
and shook hands on the deal. Victor paid Ozzie $5,000 down
in cash and agreed to pay the balance of $45,000 at an agreed
closing time and place.

Before  the  closing,  Victor  inherited  another  home  and  asked
Ozzie to return his $5,000. Ozzie refused, and, at the time set
for  the  closing,  Ozzie  tendered  a  good  deed  to  Victor  and
declared his intention to vacate Blackacre the next day. Ozzie
demanded  that  Victor  complete  the  purchase.  Victor  refused.
The fair market value of Blackacre has remained $50,000.

In  an  appropriate  action  brought  by  Ozzie  against  Victor  for
specific  performance,  if  Ozzie  loses,  the  most  likely  reason
will be that

(A)  the agreement was oral.
(B)  keeping the $5,000 is Ozzie’s exclusive remedy.
(C)  Victor had a valid reason for not closing.
(D)    Ozzie  remained  in  possession  on  the  day  set  for  the

closing.

Answer  35:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  Statute  of  Frauds
applies to all contracts for the sale of land, or for the sale of
an  interest  in  land.  Therefore,  such  a  contract  will  not  be
enforced unless it is in writing. There are a few exceptions to
this  rule  (e.g.,  where  there  has  been  part  performance  in
reliance on an oral agreement), but none of those exceptions
applies here.

599

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  is  not  the  case  that  the  seller’s
exclusive  remedy  for  breach  is  to  keep  the  deposit;  often,  a
court will order the buyer to specifically perform even where
the seller has a deposit. (Furthermore, unless the parties have
agreed  that  the  deposit  will  be  the  exclusive  measure,  the
seller will be entitled to recover his actual damages from the
buyer’s breach if these are greater than the deposit.)

(C) is wrong because the fact that Victor inherited a different
home  is  not  a  valid  reason  for  not  closing;  the  doctrine  of
frustration  of  purpose  occasionally  applies  to  land-sale
contracts,  but  would  virtually  never  apply  where  the  only
event alleged to have frustrated the buyer’s purpose is that he
found or acquired other property he liked better.

(D)  is  wrong  because  Ozzie’s  anticipated  one-day  delay  in
vacating  would  not  have  been  a  material  breach,  unless  the
agreement or the circumstances indicated that time was of the
essence.  There’s  no  indication  that  that  happened  here.
Therefore, the one-day delay would not have deprived Ozzie
of his otherwise-existing right to obtain specific performance.

B.  Marketable title

1.   Time for measuring marketability

a.  Outstanding mortgage

Question 36:  A  landowner  mortgaged  the  land  to  a  bank  to
secure  his  preexisting  obligation  to  the  bank.  The  mortgage
was  promptly  and  properly  recorded.  The  landowner  and  a
buyer  then  entered  into  a  valid  written  contract  for  the
purchase and sale of the land, which provided for the transfer
of  “a  marketable  title,  free  of  encumbrances.”  The  contract
did not expressly refer to the mortgage.
Shortly  after  entering  into  the  contract,  the  buyer  found
another  property  that  much  better  suited  her  needs  and
decided to try to avoid her contract with the landowner. When
the  buyer  discovered  the  existence  of  the  mortgage,  she
asserted that the title was encumbered and that she would not
close.  The  landowner  responded  by  offering  to  provide  for
payment and discharge of the mortgage at the closing from the
proceeds of the closing. The buyer refused to go forward, and
the  landowner  brought  an  appropriate  action  against  her  for

600

specific performance.

If the court holds for the landowner in this action, it will most
likely be because

(A)    the  mortgage  is  not  entitled  to  priority  because  it  was

granted for preexisting obligations.

(B)  the doctrine of equitable conversion supports the result.
(C)    the  landowner’s  arrangements  for  the  payment  of  the
mortgage  fully  satisfied  the  landowner’s  obligation  to
deliver marketable title.

(D)    the  existence  of  the  mortgage  was  not  the  buyer’s  real

reason for refusing to close.

Answer 36:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Unless  the  sale  contract
specifies  otherwise,  the  seller’s  title  is  not  required  to  be
marketable until the date set for the closing. The fact that there
is an outstanding mortgage on the property, therefore, does not
entitle  the  buyer  to  cancel  the  contract,  as  long  as  the  seller
has  the  right  and  probable  ability  to  pay  off  the  mortgage  at
the closing.

(A) is wrong because the fact that the mortgage was granted
for  pre-existing  obligations  (as  opposed,  say,  to  being  a
purchase  money  mortgage)  is  irrelevant  to  the  issue  of
whether  the  seller’s  title  is  marketable.  For  instance,  if  the
seller  were  not  paying  off  the  mortgage  at  the  closing,  the
mortgage  would  indeed  be  an  encumbrance  rendering  title
unmarketable,  even  though  it  was  granted  to  secure  the
seller’s pre-existing obligation to the mortgagee.

(B) is wrong because the doctrine of equitable conversion is
used  to  pass  the  risk  of  loss  to  the  buyer  under  a  purchase
contract, and has nothing to do with whether the seller’s title
is marketable.
(D)  is  wrong  because  a  purchaser’s  “real  reason”  (i.e.,
motive)  for  refusing  to  close  is  irrelevant  to  whether  the
purchaser  has  the  right  to  so  refuse.  For  example,  if  the
seller’s  title  had  been  unmarketable,  the  buyer  would  have
been entitled to refuse to close even though her real reason for
refusing was something entirely unrelated to the quality of the
seller’s title.

601

Question 37: Venner, the owner of Greenacre, a tract of land,
entered  into  an  enforceable  written  agreement  with  Brier
providing  that  Venner  would  sell  Greenacre  to  Brier  for  an
agreed price. At the place and time designated for the closing.
Venner  tendered  an  appropriate  deed,  but  Brier  responded
that  he  had  discovered  a  mortgage  on  Greenacre  and  would
not  complete  the  transaction,  because  Venner’s  title  was  not
free  of  encumbrances,  as  the  contract  required.  Venner  said
that it was his intent to pay the mortgage from the proceeds of
the sale, and he offered to put the proceeds in escrow for that
purpose  with  any  agreeable,  responsible  escrowee.  The
balance  due  on  the  mortgage  was  substantially  less  than  the
contract  purchase  price.  Brier  refused  Venner’s  proposal.
Venner  began  an  appropriate  legal  action  against  Brier  for
specific  performance.  There  is  no  applicable  statute  in  the
jurisdiction where Greenacre is located.

Venner’s best legal argument in support of his claim for relief
is that

(A)  as the seller of real estate, he had an implied right to use

the contract proceeds to clear the title being conveyed.

(B)    the  lien  of  the  mortgage  shifts  from  Greenacre  to  the

contract proceeds.

(C)    under  the  doctrine  of  equitable  conversion,  title  has
already  passed  to  Brier  and  the  only  issue  is  how  the
purchase price is to be allocated.

to  deliver 

(D)  no provision of the contract has been breached by Venner.
Answer  37:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  This  choice  correctly
identifies that Venner can use the sale proceeds to pay off the
mortgage, and thus force Brier to honor the contract. Where,
as  is  usually  the  case,  the  seller  in  a  land-sale  contract
the  property  free  and  clear  of
covenants 
encumbrances,  the  presence  of  a  mortgage  would  be  an
encumbrance rendering the title unmarketable. But you’re told
here  that  the  proceeds  will  cover  the  mortgage.  When  that’s
the case, the seller has an implied right to use the proceeds of
the sale to pay off the mortgage. When you think about it, this
rule comports with what you’d expect to happen, since many
homeowners,  in  real  life,  couldn’t  sell  their  home  if  this
weren’t the case.

602

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  law.  Although  it’s
possible  that  the  law  of  the  jurisdiction  may  make  the
mortgage  payable  from  the  proceeds,  and  the  mortgage
agreement  itself  may  insist  on  payoff  if  the  property  is
conveyed, the “rule” stated in this choice wouldn’t cause the
mortgage  to  be  removed  from  Greenacre — and  that’s  the
central problem here. Instead, the key is that the seller gets to
use the sale proceeds to pay off the mortgage simultaneously
with the closing of title.

(C)  is  wrong  because  the  doctrine  of  equitable  conversion
would  not  apply  to  these  facts.  The  doctrine  of  equitable
conversion  addresses  the  period  between  the  signing  of  the
land  sale  contract  and  the  closing.  Under  the  doctrine,  the
vendor  has  a  personal  property  interest  in  the  property,
between the signing of the contract and the closing, in the form
of the balance of the purchase price owed to him; the vendee
is  considered  the  beneficial  owner  of  the  property.  The
doctrine  wouldn’t  help  with  the  problem  here,  which  is  that
Venner can’t deliver marketable title unless he can remove the
mortgage.

(D) is wrong because it states an insufficient ground on which
Venner could prevail. Of course, his underlying argument must
be that he hasn’t breached the contract, because if he had, he
wouldn’t  be  entitled  to  specific  performance.  However,
Choice (D), in and of itself, doesn’t provide a rule allowing
Venner  to  use  the  proceeds  to  pay  off  the  mortgage,  and
enforce the contract. Only Choice (A) does this.

C.  Remedies for failure to perform

1.  Damages

a.  Where no earnest money deposit

i.  Consideration argument

Question  38:  Able  was  the  owner  of  Blackacre,  an
undeveloped  city  lot.  Able  and  Baker  executed  a  written
document  in  which  Able  agreed  to  sell  Blackacre  to  Baker
and Baker agreed to buy Blackacre from Able for $200,000;
the  document  did  not  provide  for  an  earnest  money  down
payment.  Able  recorded  the  document,  as  authorized  by

603

statute.

Able  orally  gave  Baker  permission  to  park  his  car  on
Blackacre  without  charge  prior  to  the  closing.  Thereafter,
Baker frequently parked his car on Blackacre.

Another property came on the market that Baker wanted more
than Blackacre. Baker decided to try to escape any obligation
to Able.

Baker had been told that contracts for the purchase and sale of
real  property  require  consideration  and  concluded  that
because  he  had  made  no  earnest  money  down  payment,  he
could refuse to close and not be liable. Baker notified Able of
his  intention  not  to  close  and,  in  fact,  did  refuse  to  close  on
the  date  set  for  the  closing.  Able  brought  an  appropriate
action to compel specific performance by Baker.

If Able wins, it will be because
(A)    Baker’s  use  of  Blackacre  for  parking  constitutes  part

performance.

(B)    general  contract  rules  regarding  consideration  apply  to

real estate contracts.

(C)  the doctrine of equitable conversion applies.
(D)  the document was recorded.
Answer  38:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  It  is  likely,  though  not
absolutely  certain,  that  Abel  will  be  able  to  obtain  specific
performance  (the  court  will  have  to  be  satisfied  that  money
damages  would  not  give  him  an  adequate  remedy).  But  one
thing  that  is  certain  is  that  Baker  will  fail  with  his  lack-of-
the  general  contract
consideration  argument,  because 
principle 
the
consideration  requirement  applies  to  real  estate  contracts.
Able has made a promise (to convey in return for the purchase
price),  and  Baker  has  made  a  return  promise  (to  pay  the
purchase  price  in  return  for  title),  so  standard  consideration
requirements  are  easily  satisfied.  The  fact  that  there  was  no
earnest  money  deposit  is  completely  irrelevant  to  the
consideration  issue — an  earnest  money  deposit  is  not
required,  and  where  present  is  merely  a  form  of  liquidated-
damages clause.

that  an  exchange  of  promises  meets 

604

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  contract,  since  it  is  in  writing  and
meets  the  consideration  requirement,  would  be  binding  even
if  Baker  had  not  parked  on  the  property  and  therefore
arguably  partly  performed.  (If  the  contract  had  been  oral,
Baker’s  parking  might  supply  him  with  an  argument  for
application of the part-performance exception to the Statute of
Frauds,  but  even  here,  he  would  probably  lose  because  the
parking was not really part “performance.”)

is  wrong  because  equitable  conversion,  where
(C) 
applicable, vests “equitable title” in the vendee under a land
sale contract (thus passing the risk of loss to the vendee), and
neither  equitable  title  nor  risk  of  loss  is  at  issue  on  these
facts.

(D) is wrong because a vendor under a land sale contract can
recover for breach (including specific performance if money
damages  would  not  be  an  adequate  remedy)  whether  the
contract was recorded or not — recording is merely relevant
to the vendee’s rights vis-à-vis later grantees from the vendor
(by  giving  the  world  constructive  notice  of  the  pending
transfer), not to the vendee’s rights vis-à-vis the vendor.

2.  Specific performance

a.  Breaching buyer

Question 39:  Adam  entered  into  a  valid  written  contract  to
sell  Blackacre,  a  large  tract  of  land,  to  Betsy.  At  that  time,
Blackacre was owned by Adam’s father, Fred; Adam had no
title to Blackacre and was not the agent of Fred.

After  the  contract  was  executed  and  before  the  scheduled
closing  date.  Fred  died  intestate,  leaving  Adam  as  his  sole
heir. Shortly thereafter, Adam received an offer for Blackacre
that  was  substantially  higher  than  the  purchase  price  in  the
contract  with  Betsy.  Adam  refused  to  close  with  Betsy
although she was ready, willing, and able to close pursuant to
the contract.

Betsy brought an appropriate action for specific performance
against Adam.
In that action, Betsy should be awarded
(A)  nothing, because Adam had no authority to enter into the

605

contract with Betsy.

(B)  nothing, because the doctrine of after-acquired title does

not apply to executory contracts.

(C)    judgment  for  specific  performance,  because  Adam

acquired title prior to the scheduled closing.

(D)    judgment  for  specific  performance,  to  prevent  unjust

enrichment of Adam.

Answer  39:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  purchaser  under  a
land-sale  contract  will  normally  be  entitled  to  a  decree  of
specific  performance  if  the  seller  is  able  but  unwilling  to
perform. Here, the fact that Adam did not have title at the time
he signed the contract is irrelevant; the contract called for him
to make a conveyance at the scheduled closing date, and he is
able  to  do  that.  The  case  therefore  falls  within  the  familiar
principle  that  the  time  for  measuring  whether  a  seller  has
marketable title is the time for closing, not some earlier date.

(A)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  Adam  did  not  have
authority  to  sell  the  land  at  the  moment  of  signing  is
irrelevant; he has title by now (prior to the scheduled closing
date),  and  that’s  all  that  matters  for  purposes  of  specific
performance.

(B) is wrong because the doctrine of after-acquired title is not
necessary for a decree of specific performance here; all that
matters  is  that  Adam  has  title  by  the  time  scheduled  for
performance.

(D) is wrong because specific performance is used for breach
of contract where (as here) damages would be an inadequate
remedy, and the concept of unjust enrichment is not needed or
relevant to whether specific performance should be decreed.

3.  Deposit

a.  Reasonable estimate

Question 40: Three months ago, Bert agreed in writing to buy
Sam’s  single-family  residence,  Liveacre,  for  $110,000.  Bert
paid  Sam  a  $5,000  deposit  to  be  applied  to  the  purchase
price. The contract stated that Sam had the right at his option
to  retain  the  deposit  as  liquidated  damages  in  the  event  of
Ben’s default. The closing was to have taken place last week.

606

Six weeks ago, Bert was notified by his employer that he was
to  be  transferred  to  another  job  1,000  miles  away.  Bert
immediately  notified  Sam  that  he  could  not  close,  and
therefore he demanded the return of his $5,000. Sam refused,
waited  until  after  the  contract  closing  date,  listed  with  a
broker, and then conveyed Liveacre for $108,000 to Conner, a
purchaser found by the real estate broker. Conner paid the full
purchase  price  and  immediately  recorded  his  deed.  Conner
knew of the prior contract with Bert. In an appropriate action,
Bert seeks to recover the $5,000 deposit from Sam.

The most probable result will be that Sam

(A)    must  return  the  $5,000  to  Bert,  because  Sam  can  no

longer carry out his contract with Bert.

(B)  must return the $5,000 to Bert, because Bert was legally

justified in not completing the contract.

(C)  must return $3,000 to Bert, because Sam’s damages were

only $2,000.

(D)  may keep the $5,000 deposit, because Bert breached the

contract.

Answer  40:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  contract  provision
concerning  the  deposit  was  a  liquidated  damages  clause.  In
most courts, a liquidated damages clause is enforceable if it
was a reasonable estimate (viewed either  as  of  the  time  the
contract was made or at the time of suit) of the damages that
the seller would likely incur if the buyer breached. Here, an
estimate, as of the time the contract was signed, that the seller
would sustain $5,000 in damages if there was a breach on a
$110,000 contract, seems reasonable. The fact that the seller
ended  up  with  a  slightly  smaller-than-predicted  loss  of
$2,000  (not  counting  any  incidental  expenses  to  the  seller
from  having  to  re-list  the  property  or  wait  for  a  later  sale)
does  not  change  the  reasonableness  of  the  time-of-contract
estimate;  in  fact,  the  $5,000  estimate  is  probably  also
reasonable viewed as of the time of suit.
(A) is wrong because Sam’s present inability to carry out his
contract with Bert was caused by Bert’s breach, and therefore
does  not  nullify  Sam’s  ability  to  rely  on  the  liquidated
damages clause.

607

(B) is wrong because Bert’s need to transfer is not the sort of
extraordinary event that would excuse Bert’s nonperformance.

(C)  is  wrong  because,  as  explained  in  (D),  the  liquidated
damages clause will be enforced here, even though it differs
from the seller’s actual damages.

D.  Equitable conversion

1.  Effect of pending contract

Question 41: On September 1, a seller and a buyer executed
an agreement for the sale of real property, closing scheduled
for  November  1.  The  jurisdiction  in  which  the  property  is
located recognizes the principle of equitable conversion and
has no statute pertinent to this problem.

The seller died before closing, and his will left his personal
property  to  his  son  and  his  real  property  to  his  daughter.
Assuming  that  there  has  been  no  breach  of  the  agreement  by
either party (or that party’s successor in interest), which of the
following is correct?

(A)    Death,  an  eventuality  for  which  the  parties  could  have
provided,  terminates  the  agreement  if  they  did  not  so
provide.

(B)  The daughter is entitled to the proceeds of the sale when
it  closes,  because  the  doctrine  of  equitable  conversion
does not apply to these circumstances.

(C)    The  son  is  entitled  to  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  when  it

closes.

(D)  Title was rendered unmarketable by the seller’s death.
Answer 41: The correct choice is (C). Under the doctrine of
equitable conversion, during the period between the land sale
contract and the conveyance, the purchaser is considered the
equitable  owner  of  the  property,  and  the  seller  is  deemed  to
have  a  personal  property  interest  in  the  purchase  price.
Therefore,  if  the  seller  dies  before  the  conveyance  takes
place,  the  one  entitled  to  his  personal  property  is  entitled  to
the purchase price. (The one entitled to his real property only
gets a bare legal title, which she must convey to the purchaser
when the purchaser performs his duty under the contract, i.e.,
turns  over  the  cash.)  Under  these  facts,  the  son  is  entitled  to

608

the  seller’s  personalty,  so  he  gets  all  the  cash  from  the  sale,
and the daughter is out of luck.

(A)  is  wrong,  because  death  does  not  terminate  a  land  sale
contract.  As  long  as  the  land  sale  contract  is  specifically
enforceable,  if  the  vendor  dies  before  the  conveyance  takes
place,  the  one  to  whom  he  willed  his  personal  property  is
entitled  to  the  purchase  price  when  the  conveyance  takes
place. This is part of the doctrine of equitable conversion. If
you chose this response, it could be because you thought the
situation was covered by the rule that terminates an offer on
the death or insanity of either the offeror or the offeree. That
rule  is  not  involved  here,  since  there’s  an  enforceable
contract already in place.

(B) is wrong because it arrives at the wrong conclusion and
states, wrongly, that the doctrine of equitable conversion does
not  apply  to  these  circumstances.  In  fact,  the  doctrine  of
equitable conversion does  apply  to  these  circumstances,  and
its  operation  means  that  the  person  entitled  to  the  seller’s
personal  property — his  son — is  entitled  to  the  purchase
price. Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, during the
period between the land sale contract and the conveyance, the
purchaser is considered the beneficial owner of the property,
and the seller has a personal property interest in the purchase
price. If the seller dies before the conveyance takes place, the
one  entitled  to  his  personal  property  is  entitled  to  the
purchase  price.  (The  one  entitled  to  his  real  property  only
gets a bare legal title, which he must convey to the purchaser
when the purchaser performs his duty under the contract, i.e.,
turns over the cash.)

(D) is wrong, because it misstates the rule of law, and, in any
case,  the  concept  of  marketable  title  is  irrelevant  to  these
facts.
Title  is  not  rendered  unmarketable  by  the  seller’s  death.  A
marketable title is one that, viewed objectively, is free from
reasonable doubt in both law and fact, and that the reasonable
buyer would accept without fear of litigation. The conveyance
of  marketable  title  is  an  implied  covenant  in  land  sale
contracts. (However, the terms of the deed will control once
the deed is conveyed and accepted; thus, if a quitclaim deed

609

is conveyed, there will be no remaining obligation to provide
marketable  title.)  Here,  the  mere  fact  that  the  seller  died
would not render the title unmarketable. Since the doctrine of
equitable  conversion  is  followed  in  the  jurisdiction,  there’s
no  question  that  the  one  entitled  to  the  seller’s  personal
property — his son — will be entitled to the purchase price.
Thus,  there  is  no  reasonable  doubt  as  to  law  and  fact,  and
there should be no reasonable fear of litigation. Therefore, the
title is not unmarketable.

2.  Risk of loss

Question 42: Landover, the owner in fee simple of Highacre,
an  apartment  house  property,  entered  into  an  enforceable
written agreement with VanMeer to sell Highacre to VanMeer.
The agreement provided that a good and marketable title was
to be conveyed free and clear of all encumbrances. However,
the  agreement  was  silent  as  to  the  risk  of  fire  prior  to  the
closing,  and  there  is  no  applicable  statute  in  the  state  where
the land is located. The premises were not insured. The day
before  the  scheduled  closing  date,  Highacre  was  wholly
destroyed by fire. When VanMeer refused to close, Landover
brought  an  action  in  specific  performance.  If  Landover
prevails, the most likely reason will be that

(A)    the  failure  of  VanMeer  to  insure  his  interest  as  the
purchaser of Highacre precludes any relief for him.
(B)  the remedy at law is inadequate in actions concerning real
estate  contracts  and  either  party  is  entitled  to  specific
performance.

(C)    equity  does  not  permit  consideration  of  surrounding
circumstances in actions concerning real estate contracts.

(D)  the doctrine of equitable conversion applies.
Answer  42:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Under  the  doctrine  of
equitable conversion, the vendee is considered the beneficial
owner  of  the  property  after  the  sales  contract  takes  effect,
leaving  the  vendor  with  a  personal  property  interest  in  the
property, in the form of the balance of the purchase price the
vendee owes him. This common law doctrine is followed by
most  states.  In  a  state  following  equitable  conversion,  the
vendee is required to close, even though the structures on the

610

property have been destroyed. (But the vendee gets the benefit
of  any  insurance  policy  the  vendor  may  have  had  on  the
structure.)

(A) is wrong because it relies on a fact which is irrelevant:
VanMeer’s failure to insure the property is not dispositive of
Landover’s  ability  to  recover  the  purchase  price.  Whether
VanMeer did or did not buy insurance (which he could have 
— he  had  an  insurable  interest  as  soon  as  he  signed  the
contract), Landover would still be able to force a closing, if
and only if the jurisdiction applies equitable conversion (see
Choice (D) above).

(B) is wrong because although it is a correct statement of the
law, it would be insufficient, under these facts, to result in a
decision  for  Landover.  (B)  is  correct  in  that,  in  general,
remedies  at  law  (e.g.,  damages)  are  inadequate  in  actions
where real estate is involved, since real estate is “unique.” In
such  situations,  specific  performance  is  an  appropriate
remedy.  However,  specific  performance  is  an  equitable
remedy,  meaning  that  equitable  considerations  will  be  taken
into  account  to  determine  if  it’s  appropriate.  Choice  (D)  is
just  such  a  consideration — the  doctrine  of  equitable
conversion.  Conversely,  if  the  jurisdiction  does  not  apply
equitable  conversion,  Landover  won’t  be  able  to  force  a
closing even though his remedy at law is inadequate.

the 

Question 43: A seller owned a single-family house. A buyer
gave  the  seller  a  signed  handwritten  offer  to  purchase  the
house.  The  offer  was  unconditional  and  sufficient  to  satisfy
the  Statute  of  Frauds,  and  when  the  seller  signed  an
acceptance an enforceable contract resulted.
The house on the land had been the seller’s home, but he had
moved to an apartment, so the house was vacant at all times
relevant  to  the  proposed  transaction.  Two  weeks  after  the
parties  had  entered  into  their  contract,  one  week  after  the

611

buyer  had  obtained  a  written  mortgage  lending  commitment
from a lender, and one week before the agreed-upon closing
date,  the  house  was  struck  by  lightning  and  burned  to  the
ground. The loss was not insured because, three years earlier,
the  seller  had  let  his  homeowner’s  insurance  policy  lapse
after  he  had  paid  his  mortgage  debt  in  full.  The  handwritten
contract was wholly silent as to matters of financing, risk of
loss,  and  insurance.  The  buyer  declared  the  contract  voided
by  the  fire,  but  the  seller  asserted  a  right  to  enforce  the
contract  despite  the  loss.  There  is  no  applicable  statute.  If  a
court finds for the seller, what is the likely reason?

(A)    The  contract  was  construed  against  the  buyer,  who

drafted it.

(B)  The lender’s written commitment to make a mortgage loan
to the buyer made the contract of sale fully binding on the
buyer.

(C)    The  risk  of  loss  falls  on  the  party  in  possession,  and
constructive  possession  passed  to  the  buyer  on  the
contract date.

(D)  The risk of loss passed to the buyer on the contract date

under the doctrine of equitable conversion.

Answer  43:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Under  the  equitable
conversion doctrine, courts treat the signing of the contract as
vesting  equitable  ownership  of  the  land  in  the  purchaser.
(Conversely,  the  seller  is  treated  as  becoming  the  equitable
owner  of  the  purchase  price.)  Not  all  courts  apply  the
doctrine  of  equitable  conversion  (though  most  do).  When  a
court does apply the doctrine, the main result is that the risk of
loss is deemed to belong to the equitable owner of the land,
i.e., the buyer. So where, as here, the contract is unconditional
and  silent  as  to  the  risk  of  loss,  if  equitable  conversion
applies, the buyer will be deemed to bear the risk of loss and
cannot cancel the contract.

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  relies  on  an  irrelevant  fact.  It  does
not matter who drafted the contract if it is silent as to risk of
loss  and  there  is  no  applicable  statute.  By  contrast  (and  as
further described in the analysis of Choice (D) above), it does
matter  whether  the  court  applies  the  doctrine  of  equitable
conversion. If the doctrine applies (as it does in the majority

612

of courts), the risk of loss is deemed to pass to the buyer as
soon  as  the  contract  is  signed,  assuming  that  the  contract  is
silent  on  the  risk-of-loss  issue.  If  equitable  conversion  does
not apply, the court will apply the minority common law rule,
under which the risk of loss remains with the seller until the
closing.

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  relies  on  an  irrelevant  fact.  The
contract became binding when the seller accepted the buyer’s
offer.  The  facts  state  that  the  offer  to  purchase  was
unconditional,  so  the  buyer  was  obligated  to  purchase  the
house  whether  or  not  he  got  a  loan  commitment.  In  a
jurisdiction applying equitable conversion, the buyer was thus
the equitable owner as of the time seller signed an acceptance
and, as of that moment, the buyer bore the risk of loss.

(C)  is  wrong  because  possession  does  not  pass  to  the  buyer
until  closing,  absent  a  contrary  provision  in  the  contract  of
sale.  On  the  other  hand,  equitable  ownership  passes  on  the
signing of the contract, and that is enough to transfer the risk
of loss to the buyer if the jurisdiction applies the doctrine of
equitable  conversion  (as  described  above  in  the  analysis  of
Choice (D)).

II.   MORTGAGES AND INSTALLMENT

CONTRACTS

A.  Nature of mortgage

1.  Sale of mortgaged property

a.  Assumption

Question 44: Several years ago, a man purchased a building,
financing a large part of the purchase price by a loan from a
bank  that  was  secured  by  a  mortgage.  The  man  made  the
installment payments on the mortgage regularly until last year.
Then  the  man  persuaded  an  investor  to  buy  the  building,
subject  to  the  mortgage  to  the  bank.  They  expressly  agreed
that the investor would not assume and agree to pay the man’s
debt to the bank. The man’s mortgage to the bank contained a
due-on-sale clause stating, ‘‘If the mortgagor transfers his/her
interest  without  the  written  consent  of  the  mortgagee  first

613

obtained,  then  at  the  mortgagee’s  option  the  entire  principal
balance  of  the  debt  secured  by  this  mortgage  shall  become
immediately due and payable.’’ However, without seeking the
bank’s consent, the man conveyed the building to the investor,
the deed stating in pertinent part, ‘‘subject to a mortgage to’’
the bank and giving details and recording data.

The  investor  took  possession  of  the  building  and  made
several  mortgage  payments,  which  the  bank  accepted.  Now,
however,  neither  the  investor  nor  the  man  has  made  the  last
three  mortgage  payments.  The  bank  has  brought  an
appropriate  action  against  the  investor  for  the  amount  of  the
delinquent payments. In this action, judgment should be for

(A)  the investor, because she did not assume and agree to pay

the man’s mortgage debt.

(B)    the  investor,  because  she  is  not  in  privity  of  estate  with

the bank.

(C)  the bank, because the man’s deed to the investor violated

the due-on-sale clause.

(D)  the bank, because the investor is in privity of estate with

the bank.

Answer  44:  Choice  (A)  is  correct,  because  the  investor
would have to assume the man’s mortgage to be liable under
it.  When  a  person  buys  a  mortgaged  property  without
assuming  the  mortgage,  the  buyer  has  no  liability  on  the
mortgage. That’s true even if the mortgage contains a due-on-
sale clause. The clause will be enforced (and will entitle the
mortgagee  to  accelerate  the  mortgage),  but  the  clause  won’t
cause the buyer to be deemed to have assumed the mortgage,
and  therefore  won’t  require  the  buyer  to  pay  for  any  missed
payments.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  privity  of  estate  is  not  an  issue  in
mortgage cases. Privity of estate makes a difference in cases
involving covenants at law. Absence of privity of estate may
mean that a successor to the covenantor won’t be bound. But a
mortgage is not a covenant running with the land, so privity of
estate doesn’t matter.
(C) is wrong, because the violation of the due-on-sale clause
didn’t make the investor personally liable on the mortgage. A

614

due-on-sale clause allows a lender to demand full payment of
the  remainder  of  an  existing  loan  if  the  mortgagor  transfers
any  interest  in  the  property  securing  the  loan  without  the
lender’s  consent.  The  violation  of  the  due-on-sale  clause
would give the bank grounds for a case against the man, and
grounds to accelerate the mortgage, but not grounds to obtain
a personal judgment against the investor. The investor did not
assume  the  man’s  debt  to  the  bank,  and  the  violation  of  the
due-on-sale clause does not change this fact.

(D)  is  wrong,  because  a  mortgage  is  not  a  covenant  running
with  the  land,  making  privity  of  estate  irrelevant.  Privity  of
estate  makes  a  difference  in  cases  involving  covenants
running with land. A covenant running with the land is simply
a  contract  between  two  parties,  which,  because  it  meets
certain technical requirements, has the additional quality that
it is binding against one who later buys the promisor’s land.
In determining whether a covenant runs with the land, one of
the requirements is that there be privity of estate between the
parties.

However, a mortgage is not a covenant running with the land.
Therefore, the existence or non-existence of privity of estate
as between the bank and the investor is irrelevant — the bank
would  only  prevail  against  the  investor  if  the  investor
expressly assumed the mortgage that existed between the man
and the bank, which she didn’t.

i.  Receipt of deed with assumption clause

Question  45:  A  man  borrowed  money  from  a  bank  and
executed  a  promissory  note  for  the  amount  secured  by  a
mortgage on his residence. Several years later, the man sold
his residence. As provided by the contract of sale, the deed to
the  buyer  provided  that  the  buyer  agreed  “to  assume  the
existing mortgage debt” on the residence.
Subsequently, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage loan to the
bank, and appropriate foreclosure proceedings were initiated.
The foreclosure sale resulted in a deficiency.
There is no applicable statute.
Is the buyer liable for the deficiency?

615

(A)  No, because even if the buyer assumed the mortgage, the

seller is solely responsible for any deficiency.

(B)  No, because the buyer did not sign a promissory note to

the bank and therefore has no personal liability.

(C)    Yes,  because  the  buyer  assumed  the  mortgage  and
therefore became personally liable for the mortgage loan
and any deficiency.

(D)    Yes,  because  the  transfer  of  the  mortgage  debt  to  the
buyer resulted in a novation of the original mortgage and
loan  and  rendered  the  buyer  solely  responsible  for  any
deficiency.

Answer 45: Choice (C) is correct. When a buyer assumes the
seller’s mortgage, the buyer becomes primarily liable for the
mortgage  debt.  (The  seller  is  secondarily  liable,  assuming
there  is  no  release.)  The  lender  may  therefore  sue  the  buyer
for the deficiency when a foreclosure sale is not sufficient to
discharge  the  debt.  (Contrast  this  to  the  situation  where  the
buyer  takes  “subject  to  the  mortgage.”  In  that  situation,  the
buyer would not be personally liable for the mortgage debt or
for a deficiency judgment after foreclosure.)

When a buyer knowingly receives a deed that recites that the
buyer  is  assuming  the  mortgage  and  intends  to  be  bound,
assumption  occurs  even  though  the  buyer  has  not  signed  the
deed. (Here, where the buyer previously signed the contract,
which  called  for  assumption,  it’s  even  more  clear  that  the
buyer will be deemed to have assumed even though he never
signed the deed.)

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  law.  When  a  buyer
agrees  to  “assume”  a  mortgage,  this  language  is  always
interpreted  to  mean  that  if  the  lender  forecloses  and  is  left
with  a  deficiency  judgment,  the  lender  can  recover  that
deficiency  from  the  assuming  buyer  without  first  trying  to
recover  it  from  the  original  borrower.  In  other  words,  the
assuming buyer becomes “primarily liable” for the mortgage
debt and for any deficiency after foreclosure sale.
(B)  is  wrong  because  it  was  not  necessary  for  the  buyer  to
sign a promissory note to be liable. Once the buyer assumed
the mortgage, he became primarily liable on the mortgage and

616

thus  is  liable  for  the  deficiency.  (And  the  fact  that  the  buyer
didn’t sign the deed doesn’t prevent him from being deemed
to  have  assumed,  as  long  as  the  buyer  knew  the  deed
contained an assumption provision; see Choice (C) for more
about this.)

(D) gives the right result but the wrong rationale. The buyer’s
assumption  of  the  mortgage  is  not  the  same  as  a  novation.
With  a  novation,  the  bank  agrees  to  substitute  the  personal
liability  of  the  buyer  for  that  of  the  original  debtor  and
releases the original debtor. Nothing in the facts suggests the
bank’s  involvement  in  the  transaction  at  all,  let  alone  its
willingness to release the original borrower.

Question  46:  Ashton  owned  Woodsedge,  a  tract  used  for
commercial purposes, in fee simple and thereafter mortgaged
it  to  First  Bank.  She  signed  a  promissory  note  secured  by  a
duly executed and recorded mortgage. There was no “due on
sale”  clause,  that  is,  no  provision  that,  upon  sale,  the  whole
balance  then  owing  would  become  due  and  owing.  Ashton
conveyed Woodsedge to Beam “subject to a mortgage to First
Bank,  which  the  grantee  assumes  and  agrees  to  pay.”  Beam
conveyed  Woodsedge  to  Carter  “subject  to  an  existing
mortgage to First Bank.” A copy of the note and the mortgage
that secured it had been exhibited to each grantee.
After Carter made three timely payments, no further payments
were  made  by  any  party.  In  fact,  the  real  estate  had
depreciated to a point where it was worth less than the debt.

There is no applicable statute or regulation.

In  an  appropriate  foreclosure  action,  First  Bank  joined
Ashton,  Beam,  and  Carter  as  defendants.  At  the  foreclosure
sale,  although  the  fair  market  value  for  Woodsedge  in  its
depreciated state was obtained, a deficiency resulted.
First Bank is entitled to collect a deficiency judgment against
(A)  Ashton only.
(B)  Ashton and Beam only.
(C)  Beam and Carter only.
(D)  Ashton, Beam, and Carter.
Answer  46:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Ashton  is  personally

617

liable because she signed the original promissory note. Beam
is  personally  liable  because  he  assumed  the  mortgage  by
means of the document that conveyed to him (and the fact that
Beam may not have signed the deed won’t matter, as long as
he  was  aware  of  the  assumption  language  in  the  deed  and
intended  to  be  bound  by  it.)  First  Bank  can  recover  even
though  it  was  not  a  party  to  the  Beam-to-Ashton  promise,
because  First  Bank  would  be  found  to  be  an  intended
beneficiary  (and  thus  a  third  party  beneficiary  who  may
recover)  of  that  promise.  Carter  is  not  personally  liable,
because a person who receives a conveyance stating that the
transfer  is  “subject  to”  an  outstanding  mortgage  does  not,
without more, assume (i.e., become personally liable for) the
mortgage. Carter’s lack of liability did not change by virtue of
the fact that he made several timely payments; only an express
promise  of  assumption  by  Carter  (made  either  to  Ashton,
Beam  or  First  Bank)  could  have  rendered  him  personally
liable.

(A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  wrong  to  the  extent  that  they  are
inconsistent with the above analysis.

2.  Redemption of mortgage

a.  Who has right

i.  No redemption until entire mortgage paid off

Question 47:  A  brother  and  sister  owned  a  property  in  fee
simple as tenants in common, each owning an undivided one-
half interest. The two joined in mortgaging the property to an
investor  by  a  properly  recorded  mortgage  that  contained  a
general  warranty  clause.  The  brother  became  disenchanted
with  land-owning  and  notified  his  sister  that  he  would  no
longer  contribute  to  the  payment  of  installments  due  to  the
investor.  After  the  mortgage  was  in  default  and  the  investor
made  demand  for  payment  of  the  entire  amount  of  principal
and  interest  due,  the  sister  tendered  to  the  investor,  and  the
investor deposited, a check for one-half of the amount due the
investor. The sister then demanded a release of her undivided
one-half interest. The investor refused to release any interest
in the property. The sister promptly brought an action against
the investor to quiet title to an undivided one-half interest in

618

the property.

In such action, the sister should

(A)  lose, because the investor’s title had been warranted by

an express provision of the mortgage.

(B)  lose, because there was no redemption from the mortgage.
(C)  win, because the sister is entitled to marshalling.
(D)    win,  because  the  cotenancy  of  the  mortgagors  was  in

common and not joint.

Answer 47: Choice (B) is correct. The mortgage attached to
the  entire  property,  and  payment  of  1/2  the  total  amount
therefore  did  not  “free  up”  a  1/2  undivided  interest.  The
investor as mortgagee has a lien on the entire property. That
is,  the  investor  received  a  security  interest  on  the  full
property — and the concomitant right upon default to conduct
a judicial sale of the full property to get her debt repaid — 
regardless  of  whether  one  party  paid  that  party’s  full  share.
A.L.P. § 16.172. In other words, the investor is entitled to say,
“Who  paid  what  is  between  the  two  of  you — I’ve  got  the
right to have the whole property sold at foreclosure if any part
of my loan is in default and the default is not wholly cured.”
That’s what happened here. (The sister’s remedy is a suit in
contribution against the brother for 1/2 the amount she paid to
the investor.)

(A)  is  wrong,  because  the  investor  did  not  have  title  to  the
property.  A  mortgage  is  a  security  interest  in  a  property
securing  a  loan.  The  fact  that  the  mortgage  instrument
contained a clause in which the brother and sister warranted
that they owned the property free of encumbrances (which is
what  the  general  warranty  clause  did)  is  irrelevant  to  the
issue of whether the sister is entitled to quiet title.
(C)  is  wrong,  because  the  equitable  doctrine  of  marshaling
does  not  apply  to  these  facts.  Marshalling  is  the  ranking  of
assets  in  a  certain  order  toward  the  payment  of  debts.  The
concept arises in equity, and means that where there are two
creditors, with the senior one having two funds to satisfy his
debt, that senior creditor must resort first to the fund which is
not  subject  to  demand  of  the  junior  creditor.  The  concept  is
misapplied to this fact pattern, because the doctrine would be

619

one  a  second  mortgagee  invoked  to  protect  his  interest  from
the  first  mortgagee’s  foreclosure.  Under  these  facts  there  is
only one mortgage on the property, and as a party who joined
with  the  brother  in  making  the  mortgage  on  the  property,  the
sister would not be able to have her interest released.

(D)  is  wrong,  because  the  sister  would  lose  even  if  the
cotenancy  was  joint.  Joint  tenancy  differs  from  tenancy  in
common only with respect to the right of survivorship, which
exists as to the former but not the latter. There is no difference
in  the  legal  analysis  here  between  the  joint-tenancy  and
tenancy-in-common scenarios.

3.  Priorities (allocation of foreclosure proceeds)

a.  Judgment lien creditor’s status

i.  Two-property scenario

Question  48:  A  businessman  owned  a  hotel,  subject  to  a
mortgage securing a debt he owed to a bank. The businessman
later acquired a nearby parking garage, financing a part of the
purchase  price  by  a  loan  from  a  financing  company,  secured
by a mortgage on the parking garage. Two years thereafter, the
businessman  defaulted  on  the  loan  owed  to  the  bank,  which
caused the full amount of that loan to become immediately due
and payable. The bank decided not to foreclose the mortgage
on the hotel at that time, but instead properly sued for the full
amount of the defaulted loan. The bank obtained and properly
filed a judgment for that amount. A statute of the jurisdiction
provides:  “Any  judgment  properly  filed  shall,  for  ten  years
from  filing,  be  a  lien  on  the  real  property  then  owned  or
subsequently  acquired  by  any  person  against  whom  the
judgment  is  rendered.”  There  is  no  other  applicable  statute,
except  the  statute  providing  for  judicial  foreclosure  of
mortgages,  which  places  no  restriction  on  deficiency
judgments. Shortly thereafter, the bank brought an appropriate
action  for  judicial  foreclosure  of  its  first  mortgage  on  the
hotel  and  of  its  judgment  lien  on  the  parking  garage.  The
financing  company  was  joined  as  a  party  defendant,  and
appropriately counterclaimed for foreclosure of its mortgage
on  the  parking  garage,  which  was  also  in  default.  All
procedures  were  properly  followed  and  the  confirmed

620

foreclosure sales resulted in the following: The net proceeds
of  the  sale  of  the  hotel  to  a  third  party  were  $200,000  less
than the bank’s mortgage balance. The net proceeds of the sale
of  the  parking  garage  to  a  fourth  party  were  $200,000  more
than the financing company’s mortgage balance.

How should the $200,000 surplus arising from the bid on the
parking garage be distributed?

(A)  It should be paid to the bank.
(B)  It should be paid to the businessman.
(C)  It should be paid to the financing company.
(D)    It  should  be  split  equally  between  the  bank  and  the

financing company.

Answer  48:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  foreclosure  sale  of
the  bank’s  mortgage  on  the  hotel  was  insufficient  to  pay  the
businessman’s  debt  to  the  bank.  The  bank  had  received  a
judgment against the businessman for the entire amount of the
defaulted loan. This lien was properly recorded and applied
to  all  property  owned  by  the  businessman  during  the
following ten-year time period, including the parking garage.
After  the  financing  company  was  paid  in  full  from  the  funds
generated  by  the  foreclosure  sale  of  its  mortgage  on  the
parking  garage,  the  additional  funds  generated  by  that  sale
would  be  paid  to  the  bank  not  as  a  deficiency  judgment,  but
because  of  the  unsatisfied  amount  of  the  prior  money
judgment.

(B) is incorrect. The judgment lien was properly filed against
the  businessman.  Therefore,  the  garage  was  subject  not  only
to the loan of the financing company, but also to the judgment
lien as a second priority. The businessman would be entitled
to surplus proceeds only if both liens had been fully paid.
(C)  is  incorrect.  The  foreclosure  sale  of  the  financing
company’s  mortgage  on  the  parking  garage  was  sufficient  to
pay  the  businessman’s  debt  to  the  financing  company  in  full.
The  fact  that  the  garage  was  sold  for  more  money  than  was
owed  under  the  garage  mortgage  is  irrelevant  to  the  amount
owed  to  the  financing  company — a  mortgagee  doesn’t
receive any part of the “surplus” after its mortgage has been
paid in full.

621

(D) is incorrect for the same reason that (C) is incorrect.

III.  DEEDS

A.  Formalities

1.  Identification of parties

Question 49: A landowner owned a valuable parcel of land
located in York County. The landowner executed a document
in  the  form  of  a  warranty  deed  of  the  parcel,  which  was
regular  in  all  respects  except  that  the  only  language
designating the grantees in each of the granting and habendum
clauses  was:  “The  leaders  of  all  the  Protestant  Churches  in
York County.” The instrument was acknowledged as required
by  statute  and  promptly  and  properly  recorded.  The
landowner told his lawyer, but no one else, that he had made
the conveyance as he did because he abhorred sectarianism in
the  Protestant  movement  and  because  he  thought  that  the
leaders would devote the asset to lessening sectarianism.
The landowner died suddenly and unexpectedly a week later,
leaving a will that bequeathed and devised his entire estate to
his  cousin.  After  probate  of  the  will  became  final  and  the
administration  on  the  landowner’s  estate  was  closed,  the
cousin  instituted  an  appropriate  action  to  quiet  title  to  the
parcel  and  properly  served  as  defendant  each  Protestant
church situated in the county.

The  only  evidence  introduced  consisted  of  the  chain  of  title
under  which  the  landowner  held,  the  probated  will,  the
recorded  deed,  the  fact  that  no  person  knew  about  the  deed
except the landowner and his lawyer, and the conversation the
landowner had with his lawyer described above.
In such action, judgment should be for
(A)    the  cousin,  because  there  is  inadequate  identification  of

grantees in the deed.

(B)    the  cousin,  because  the  state  of  the  evidence  would  not

support a finding of delivery of the deed.

(C)  the defendants, because a deed is prima facie valid until

rebutted.

622

(D)    the  defendants,  because  recording  established  delivery

prima facie until rebutted.

Answer  49:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  In  order  to  be  valid,  a
deed  must  identify  the  grantee(s)  with  reasonable  precision.
Here,  the  grantees  are  “the  leaders  of  all  the  Protestant
churches in York County.” It may be possible to identify with
acceptable  confidence  all  Protestant  churches  in  the  county,
but  it  is  unlikely  that  the  “leader”  of  each  church  can  be
identified,  given  the  imprecision  of  the  term  “leader”  in  the
context of a church (is it the minister, or is it the president of
the  congregation,  or  is  it  the  entire  board  of  directors  of  the
organization?).  Where  a  deed  does  not  identify  the  grantee
with acceptable precision, the deed will be treated as if it had
never  been  made.  That  would  mean  that  the  landowner  died
still holding title, which passed to the cousin.

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  the  deed  was  recorded
furnishes  a  strong  presumption  that  delivery  occurred  (i.e.,
that the grantor intended the deed to take effect immediately,
which is all that “delivery” means).
(C)  is  wrong  because,  while  it  may  be  true  that  a  deed  is
presumed valid, the lack of an acceptably-precise designation
of grantees here would be sufficient to rebut the presumption
of validity.

(D)  is  wrong  because,  while  recording  will  indeed  create  a
prima facie  (but  rebuttable)  case  that  delivery  occurred,  the
the
problem  here 
designation of the grantees.

is  not  delivery  but 

imprecision 

in 

Question 50: A vendee entered into a valid written contract
to  purchase  a  large  tract  of  land  from  a  vendor  for  its  fair
market value of $50,000. The contract was assignable by the
vendee.  The  vendee  duly  notified  the  vendor  to  convey  title
jointly  to  the  vendee  and  “Charles,”  Charles  being  the
vendee’s  friend  whom  the  vendee  had  not  seen  for  many
years.
When  the  vendee  learned  that  Charles  would  have  to  sign
certain  documents  in  connection  with  the  closing,  she
prevailed upon her brother to attend the closing and pretend to
be Charles. The vendee and her brother attended the closing,

623

and the vendor executed an instrument in the proper form of a
deed, purporting to convey the property to “[the vendee] and
Charles, as tenants in common.” The brother pretended that he
was Charles, and he signed Charles’s name to all the required
documents.  The  vendee  provided 
the  entire  $50,000
consideration for the transaction. The deed was promptly and
properly recorded.

Unknown  to  the  vendee  or  her  brother,  Charles  had  died
several months before the closing. Charles’s will, which was
duly probated, devised “all my real estate to my nephew” and
the residue of his estate to the vendee.

The vendee and the nephew have been unable to agree as to
the status or disposition of the property. The nephew brought
an  appropriate  action  against  the  vendor  and  the  vendee  to
quiet  legal  title  to  an  undivided  one-half  interest  in  the
property.

The court should hold that legal title to the property is vested
(A)  all in the vendor.
(B)  all in the vendee.
(C)  one-half in the vendee and one-half in the vendor.
(D)  one-half in the vendee and one-half in the nephew.
Answer  50:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Because  Charles  was
dead  at  the  time  of  the  purported  conveyance  to  the  vendee
and Charles as tenants in common, the deed’s attempt to pass
an interest to him was not effective (i.e., the deed was “void”
as to him). Therefore, no interest passed through to his estate
or via his estate to his nephew. The “Charles” portion of the
tenancy  in  common  therefore  remained  in  the  vendor.  The
deed was effective as to the vendee’s interest, however, since
she was correctly named and the deed was delivered to and
accepted  by  her;  therefore,  she  has  the  tenancy  in  common
interest that the vendor intended to convey to her.
Choices  (A),  (B),  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  they  are
inconsistent with the above analysis.

B.  Delivery of deed

1.  Delivery to agent of grantee

Question  51:  When  a  homeowner  became  ill,  he  properly

624

executed a deed sufficient to convey his home to his nephew,
who  was  then  serving  overseas  in  the  military.  Two  persons
signed as witnesses to qualify the deed for recordation under
an applicable statute. The homeowner handed the deed to his
nephew’s  friend  and  said,  “I  want  [the  nephew]  to  have  my
home.  Please  take  this  deed  for  him.”  Shortly  thereafter,  the
nephew’s  friend  learned  that  the  homeowner’s  death  was
imminent.  One  day  before  the  homeowner’s  death,  the
nephew’s  friend  recorded  the  deed.  The  nephew  returned
home  shortly  after  the  homeowner’s  death.  The  nephew’s
friend  brought  him  up  to  date,  and  he  took  possession  of  the
home.  The  homeowner  died  intestate,  leaving  a  daughter  as
his  sole  heir.  She  asserted  ownership  of  his  home.  The
nephew  brought  an  appropriate  action  against  her 
to
determine  title  to  the  home.  The  law  of  the  jurisdiction
requires  only  two  witnesses  for  a  will  to  be  properly
executed.

If  the  court  rules  for  the  nephew  and  against  the  daughter,
what is the most likely explanation?

(A)  The deed was delivered when the homeowner handed it

to the nephew’s friend.

(B)    The  delivery  of  the  deed  was  accomplished  by  the

recording of the deed.

(C)  The homeowner’s death consummated a valid gift causa

mortis to the nephew.

(D)  The homeowner’s properly executed deed was effective

as a testamentary document.

Answer 51: Choice (A)  is  correct.  An  inter  vivos  gift  (i.e.,
one  made  during  the  giver’s  lifetime)  may  be  made  of  real
estate.  The  gift  is  deemed  made  when  “delivery”  occurs,
accompanied  by  the  requisite  donative  intent.  Here,  the
homeowner had the requisite donative intent as shown by his
words.  Delivery  occurred  when  the  homeowner  physically
handed  the  deed  to  the  nephew’s  friend  as  the  agent  of  the
nephew;  this  was  delivery  because  it  is  clear  from  the
homeowner’s  words  that  he  intended  the  gift  to  take  place
immediately  rather  than  at  some  future  time.  Acceptance  is
presumed if the gift is beneficial. Once delivery occurred, the
homeowner could not recall the gift.

625

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

(B) is incorrect, because although the recording of a deed may
create  a  presumption  of  delivery,  here  the  delivery  occurred
prior  to  the  recordation  of  the  deed  (at  the  moment  the
homeowner physically handed the deed to the nephew’s friend
as the agent of the nephew, with the intent to pass the title).

(C)  is  incorrect,  because  a  gift  causa  mortis  may  only  be
made of personal property. In addition, the gift was not made
in  view  of  pending  death  from  a  stated  peril  (the  facts  only
note that the homeowner was ill).

(D) is incorrect, because a testamentary document takes effect
at the death of the testator and must have been executed with
the requisite testamentary intent. Here, the homeowner wanted
the  nephew  to  have  title  immediately  and  thus  delivered  the
deed to the nephew’s friend; the homeowner did not want to
postpone delivery until his death.

2.  Not revocable

Question 52:  Ogle  owned  Greenacre,  a  tract  of  land,  in  fee
simple. Five years ago, he executed and delivered to Lilly an
instrument  in  the  proper  form  of  a  warranty  deed  that
conveyed  Greenacre  to  Lilly  “for  and  during  the  term  of  her
natural  life.”  No  other  estate  or  interest  or  person  taking  an
interest  was  mentioned.  Lilly  took  possession  of  Greenacre
and has remained in possession.

Fifteen  months  ago,  Ogle  died,  leaving  a  will  that  has  been
duly  admitted  to  probate.  The  will,  inter  alia,  had  the
following provision:

“I devise Greenacre to Mina for her natural life and from and
after Mina’s death to Rex, his heirs and assigns, forever.”
Administration  of  Ogle’s  estate  has  been  completed.  Mina
claims  the  immediate  right  to  possession  of  Greenacre.  Rex
also asserts a right to immediate possession.
In  an  appropriate  lawsuit  to  which  Lilly,  Mina,  and  Rex  are
parties,  who  should  be  adjudged  to  have  the  right  to
immediate possession?
(A)  Lilly, because no subsequent act of Ogle would affect her

life estate.

(B)    Mina,  because  Ogle’s  will  was  the  final  and  definitive

626

expression of his intent.

(C)  Mina, because Lilly’s estate terminated with the death of

Ogle.

(D)  Rex, because Lilly’s estate terminated with Ogle’s death
and  all  that  Ogle  had  was  the  right  to  transfer  his
reversion in fee simple.

Answer 52: Choice (A) is correct. When Ogle delivered the
deed to Lilly, she received a life estate, and nothing Ogle did
thereafter could undo or modify that life estate. Therefore, the
clause  in  Ogle’s  will  leaving  a  life  estate  to  Mina  did  not
affect Lilly’s life estate. (Instead, Mina got an executory life
estate that would not start until Lilly’s death.)

(B)  is  wrong  because  of  the  principle  stated  in  Choice  (A)
above. (C) and (D) are wrong because of this same principle;
notice that a grantor (here, Ogle) can create a life estate in the
grantee, and the grantor’s death does not act to terminate that
life estate, as Choices (C) and (D) suggest that it would.

C.  Covenants for title in warranty deed

1.  Present vs. future covenants

a.  Future covenants

Question  53:  Seller  owned  Blackacre,  improved  with  an
aging  four-story  warehouse.  The  warehouse  was  built  to  the
lot lines on all four sides. On the street side, recessed loading
docks  permitted  semi-trailers  to  be  backed  in.  After  the
tractors  were  unhooked,  the  trailers  extended  into  the  street
and occupied most of one lane of the street. Over the years, as
trailers became larger, the blocking of the street became more
severe.  The  municipality  advised  Seller  that  the  loading
docks  could  not  continue  to  be  used  because  the  trailers
blocked the street; it gave Seller 90 days to cease and desist.
During  the  90  days,  Seller  sold  and  conveyed  Blackacre  by
warranty  deed  for  a  substantial  consideration  to  Buyer.  The
problem  of  the  loading  docks  was  not  discussed  in  the
negotiations.
Upon  expiration  of  the  90  days,  the  municipality  required
Buyer 
loading  docks.  This  action
substantially reduced the value of Blackacre.

to  stop  using 

the 

627

Buyer  brought  an  appropriate  action  against  Seller  seeking
cancellation of the deed and return of all monies paid.

Such action should be based upon a claim of

(A)  misrepresentation.
(B)  breach of the covenant of warranty.
(C)  failure of consideration.
(D) mutual mistake.

Answer 53: The correct choice is (A). By concealing the fact
that  the  present  use  was  the  subject  of  current  enforcement
proceedings,  Seller  would  likely  be  found  liable  on  a
fraudulent misrepresentation theory. It is not certain that such
a claim will succeed — the case may be found to fall within
the  general  rule  that  nondisclosure  is  actionable  only  if  the
party who failed to disclose had an affirmative duty to do so,
and  that  there  was  no  such  duty  here.  But  the  more  likely
result  is  that  Seller  will  be  found  liable  for  his  intentional
nondisclosure. One ground for such a result is that a party to a
business transaction is under a duty to disclose “facts basic to
the transaction, if the [defendant] knows that the other is about
to enter into it under a mistake as to [those facts], and that the
other,  because  of  the  relationship  between  them,  customs  of
the trade or other objective circumstances, would reasonably
expect a disclosure of those facts.” Rest. 2d (Torts) § 551(2)
(e). Here, Buyer has a good chance of establishing that under
the  customs  of  the  real  estate  trade,  where  a  seller  offers  a
properly for a particular use (warehousing with large trucks),
which  he  knows  the  buyer  intends  to  continue,  the  buyer
would reasonably expect a disclosure that the legality of that
present use is being contested by a governmental authority.
(B)  is  wrong,  because  the  covenant  of  warranty  protects  the
grantee  only  against  an  eviction  or  disturbance,  due  to
absence of title or to an encumbrance. So the facts here fail to
support  a  claim  for  breach  of  the  warranty  covenant  in  two
respects:  (1)  the  problem  with  using  the  loading  docks  was
not a problem with title or an encumbrance (merely a problem
that  the  existing  use  violated  city  rules),  and  (2)  more
fundamentally, Buyer has not been evicted or even threatened
with eviction (he can stay on the property forever as long as

628

he doesn’t unload trailers in a way that blocks the street).

(C)  is  wrong,  because  each  party  gave  a  promise  in
consideration for the other’s promise in the original contract
of sale. In any event, any problem with consideration would
have been eliminated, because any contract rights would have
been deemed merged into the deed.

(D)  is  wrong,  because  any  “mistake”  was  certainly  not
“mutual” — Seller knew all along that the present use was the
subject of current enforcement proceedings.

D.  Undisclosed condition in house

Question 54:  Able,  who  owned  Blackacre,  a  residential  lot
improved  with  a  dwelling,  conveyed  it  for  a  valuable
consideration to Baker. The dwelling had been constructed by
a  prior  owner.  Baker  had  inspected  Blackacre  prior  to  the
purchase  and  discovered  no  defects.  After  moving  in,  Baker
became aware that sewage seeped into the basement when the
toilets  were  flushed.  Able  said  that  this  defect  had  been
present  for  years  and  that  he  had  taken  no  steps  to  hide  the
facts  from  Baker.  Baker  paid  for  the  necessary  repairs  and
brought an appropriate action against Able to recover his cost
of repair.

If Baker wins, it will be because
(A)  Able failed to disclose a latent defect.
(B)  Baker made a proper inspection.
(C)  the situation constitutes a health hazard.
(D)    Able  breached  the  implied  warranty  of  habitability  and

fitness for purpose.

Answer 54: Choice (A) is correct. An increasing number of
courts now impose liability on a home seller who is aware of
a  material  defect  and  who  fails  to  disclose  it  to  a  buyer,
where the defect is a latent one that cannot easily be found by
an inspection. It is by no means certain that a court would find
for  Baker  on  this  ground,  but  of  the  four  possibilities  this  is
the  only  one  that  offers  Baker  even  a  plausible  chance  of
success.
(B)  is  wrong  because  Baker’s  having  made  a  proper
inspection,  by  itself,  would  not  be  enough  to  ensure  him  a

629

victory.  For  instance,  if  the  defect  had  been  a  “patent”  one
(one  that  ought  to  have  been  discovered  by  a  reasonable
inspection), virtually no courts would impose liability.

(C)  is  wrong  because,  while  the  fact  that  the  condition
constitutes a health hazard is a factor making liability slightly
more likely, the key factor leading to liability is that the defect
was latent (not readily discoverable), a factor that this choice
does not refer to at all.

(D)  is  wrong  because  courts  virtually  never  hold  that  the
seller  of  a  “used”  house  built  by  someone  else  makes  an
implied  warranty  of  habitability  or  fitness  for  particular
purpose;  since  the  facts  tell  us  that  a  prior  owner  built  the
house, this rule precludes liability on warranty-of-habitability
grounds.

CHAPTER 8
RECORDING ACTS

I.    WHAT INSTRUMENTS MUST BE RECORDED

A.  What instruments must be recorded

1.  Contract of sale

Question 55: Able was the owner of Greenacre, a large tract
of  land.  Able  entered  into  a  binding  written  contract  with
Baker  for  the  sale  and  purchase  of  Greenacre  for  $125,000.
The contract required Able to convey marketable record title.

Baker  decided  to  protect  his  interest  and  promptly  and
properly recorded the contract.

Thereafter,  but  before  the  date  scheduled  for  the  closing,
Charlie  obtained  and  properly  filed  a  final  judgment  against
Able in the amount of $1 million in a personal injury suit. A
statute  in  the  jurisdiction  provides:  “Any  judgment  properly
filed  shall,  for  ten  years  from  filing,  be  a  lien  on  the  real
property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person
against whom the judgment is rendered.”

The  recording  act  of  the  jurisdiction  authorizes  recording  of
contracts and also provides: “No conveyance or mortgage of
real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for
value  and  without  notice  unless  the  same  be  recorded
according to law.”

There are no other relevant statutory provisions.

At the closing, Baker declined to accept the title of Able on
the  ground  that  Charlie’s  judgment  lien  encumbered  the  title
he would receive and rendered it unmarketable. Able brought
an appropriate action against Baker for specific performance
of the contract and joined Charlie as a party.
In this action, the judgment should be for

(A)    Able,  because  in  equity  a  purchaser  takes  free  of

judgment liens.

(B)  Able, because the contract had been recorded.
(C)  Baker, because Able cannot benefit from Baker’s action

631

in recording the contract.

(D)    Baker,  because  the  statute  creating  judgment  liens  takes

precedence over the recording act.

Answer 55: Choice (B) is correct. In most states, a land-sale
contract is recordable, and the facts here tell us that this is so
for  the  state  in  question  (by  telling  us  that  Baker  “properly
recorded  the  contract”).  Once  the  contract  was  recorded,  it
created an interest in land on the part of the vendee (namely,
the right to buy on the stated terms) that was superior to any
later-created interest in the property. Therefore, Baker’s right
to  purchase  was  superior  to  the  later-filed  judgment  lien
obtained by Charlie. Consequently, Able would be deemed to
have  marketable  title,  because  notwithstanding  the  judgment
lien he was capable of conveying the property free and clear
to Baker.

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  states  the  right  result,  but  for  the
wrong  reason.  A  purchaser  would  not  always  take  free  of  a
judgment lien; for instance, a purchaser would not take free of
a judgment lien that was filed before the purchase contract. It
is only the fact that the sale contract was recorded before the
judgment lien was filed that lets the purchaser here take free
of the lien.

(C)  is  wrong  because  Able  can  indeed  benefit  from  Baker’s
action  in  recording.  The  issue  is  whether  Able  can  convey
marketable  title  to  Baker,  and  the  fact  that  Baker  recorded
means that  Able  can  do  this;  there  is  no  rule  that  one  party
cannot benefit from the other’s action in recording.

(D) is wrong because it is a misstatement of law. The statute
creating judgment liens merely describes that a judgment lien
is  an  interest  in  property;  the  statute  does  not  say  anything
about  priorities,  a  subject  that  is  left  to  the  recording  act.
Under the recording act, an early-filed interest in land (here,
the vendee’s rights under the sale contract) takes priority over
a later-filed interest (here, the judgment lien).

II.   WHO IS PROTECTED BY THE RECORDING

ACT

632

A.  Who is a bona fide purchaser (BFP)

Question 56:  Devlin  was  the  owner  of  a  large  subdivision.
Parnell  became  interested  in  purchasing  a  lot  but  could  not
decide between Lot 40 and Lot 41. The price and fair market
value  of  each  of  those  two  lots  was  $50,000.  Parnell  paid
Devlin  $50,000,  which  Devlin  accepted,  and  Devlin
delivered  to  Parnell  a  deed  which  was  properly  executed,
complete, and ready for recording in every detail except that
the space in the deed for the lot number was left blank. Devlin
told Parnell to fill in either Lot 40 or Lot 41 according to his
decision  and  then  record  the  deed.  Parnell  visited  the
development  the  next  day  and  completely  changed  his  mind,
selecting  Lot  25.  He  filled  in  Lot  25  and  duly  recorded  the
deed.  The  price  of  Lot  25  and  its  fair  market  value  was
$75,000.

Before Devlin had time to learn of Parnell’s actions, Parnell
sold  Lot  25  to  Caruso  for  $60,000  by  a  duly  and  properly
executed,  delivered,  and  recorded  warranty  deed.  Caruso
knew that Devlin had put a price of $75,000 on Lot 25, but he
knew no other facts regarding the Devlin-Parnell transaction.
Caruso’s attorney accurately reported Parnell’s record title to
be  good,  marketable,  and  free  of  encumbrances.  Neither
Caruso nor his attorney made any further investigation outside
the  record.  Devlin  brought  an  appropriate  action  against
Caruso  to  recover  title  to  Lot  25.  If  Devlin  loses,  the  most
likely basis for the judgment is that

(A)    the  Statute  of  Frauds  prevents  the  introduction  of  any

evidence of Devlin’s and Parnell’s agreement.

(B)    recording  of  the  deed  from  Devlin  to  Parnell  precludes

any question of its genuineness.

(C)  as between Devlin and a bona fide purchaser, Devlin is

estopped.

(D)  the clean hands doctrine bars Devlin from relief.
Answer  56:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  The  goal  of  recording
statutes  is  to  protect  subsequent  bona  fide  purchasers  and
incumbrancers — those  who  pay  value  and  take  without
notice of prior conveyances, in good faith. Here, Caruso is a
bona fide purchaser, because he has no notice of any defects

633

in  the  chain  of  title.  The  price  he  paid,  $60,000,  was  a
bargain  compared  to  what  Devlin  asked  previously,  but  this
would  not  in  and  of  itself  negate  his  bona  fide  purchaser
status,  since  it  would  still  constitute  “value”  and  would  not,
barring  other  facts, 
indicate  something  untoward  was
involved.  Since  the  chain  of  title  indicates  that  Parnell  was
conveying marketable title, Caruso was not obligated to look
further.  Choice  (C)  goes  on  to  suggest  that  Devlin  is
“estopped” from denying the validity of the deed. An estoppel
occurs, in facts like these, when one has done or omitted to do
something,  and  is  as  a  result  forbidden  from  pleading  or
fact.  Here,  Devlin’s
proving  an  otherwise-important 
carelessness in allowing Parnell to fill in the deed will lead
to  his  being  bound  by  the  resultant  deed — he’ll  be
“estopped” from denying its validity.

(A) is wrong because the Statute of Frauds would not prevent
proof  of  Devlin’s  and  Parnell’s  oral  agreement.  Devlin  is
trying  to  show  that  the  deed  he  signed  has  the  wrong  lot
number  on  it,  due  to  Parnell’s  wrongdoing.  That’s  not  a
contracts  problem,  and  the  Statute  of  Frauds  applies  only  to
contracts. Except for the estoppel problem (discussed in (C)),
Devlin would be able to show that the deed as filed was not
genuine  (i.e.,  was  a  forgery  as  to  the  lot  number).  And  that
would  be  true  even  though  Devlin’s  proof  would  consist  of
proof of an oral agreement. So the Statute of Frauds wouldn’t
be relevant.

(B)  is  wrong  because  it  states  an  incorrect  rule  of  law:
Recording  a  deed  does  not  preclude  any  question  as  to  its
genuineness.  The  mere  act  of  recording  would  not,  for
instance,  make  a  fraudulent  deed  genuine.  The  upshot,
nonetheless,  might  be  that,  despite  the  fact  that  a  deed  is
incorrect,  the  bona  fide  purchaser  may  still  prevail,  on
grounds  of  estoppel.  But  (B)  states  as  a  concrete  rule  that
recording a deed means its genuineness cannot be questioned,
and this is incorrect.
(D)  is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  facts:  Devlin’s  hands
are  not  “unclean.”  Under  the  equitable  doctrine  of  “unclean
hands,” one who has acted “unconscionably,” or in a morally
reprehensible  manner,  cannot  recover.  Here,  at  most  Devlin

634

has behaved negligently; there is no basis on which to attach
any  bad  faith  to  his  behavior.  If  anything,  he  was  gullible  in
trusting  Parnell  to  fill  in  the  blank  in  the  deed  as  instructed;
but the creation of the agency did not involve wrongdoing. If
anyone, it’s Parnell who’s the wrongdoer.

B.  The “gave value” requirement

1.  Judgment creditors

Question 57: A seller owned a piece of land in fee simple, as
the land records showed, when he contracted to sell the land
to a buyer. Two weeks later, the buyer paid the agreed price
and  received  a  warranty  deed.  A  week  thereafter,  when
neither the contract nor the deed had been recorded and while
the seller remained in possession of the property, a creditor of
the seller properly filed a money judgment against the seller.
The creditor knew nothing of the buyer’s interest.
A statute in the jurisdiction provides: “Any judgment properly
filed  shall,  for  ten  years  from  filing,  be  a  lien  on  the  real
property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person
against whom the judgment is rendered.”

The  recording  act  of 
jurisdiction  provides:  “No
conveyance  or  mortgage  of  real  property  shall  be  good
against  subsequent  purchasers  for  value  and  without  notice
unless the same be recorded according to law.”

the 

The creditor brought an appropriate action to enforce her lien
against the property in the buyer’s hands.

If  the  court  decides  for  the  buyer,  it  will  most  probably  be
because

(A)  the doctrine of equitable conversion applies.
(B)  the jurisdiction’s recording act does not protect creditors.
(C)    the  seller’s  possession  gave  the  creditor  constructive

notice of the buyer’s interest.

(D)  the buyer was a purchaser without notice.
Answer 57: Choice (B) is correct. Where the language of the
recording act is ambiguous about whether judgment creditors
are covered (e.g., where, as here, “purchasers for value” are
what are covered), most courts have interpreted the statute so
as  not  to  cover  the  judgment  creditor.  There  is  no  guarantee

635

that  a  court  would  interpret  the  statute  in  this  anti-creditor
way,  but  that’s  at  least  a  possibility,  and  of  the  four  choices
this is the most likely explanation for an anti-creditor result.
(Remember, you’re not asked to say how the case will come
out — you’re  merely  asked  to  say  what  the  most  likely
rationale will be if the case is decided for the buyer.)

Choice  (A)  is  wrong  because  the  doctrine  of  equitable
conversion has nothing to do with any issue presented by this
question.  Equitable  conversion,  where  the  court  chooses  to
apply  it,  makes  a  vendor  under  a  land-sale  agreement  the
“equitable seller,” and the vendee the “equitable buyer.” The
main consequence of the doctrine’s application is that risk of
loss passes to the buyer upon the signing of the contract, even
though the seller still holds the legal title.

Choice (C) is wrong, because the seller’s possession would
not suggest the seller had sold the property to the buyer. Under
a  recording  statute  like  the  one  here,  a  subsequent  bona  fide
purchaser  (i.e.,  a  person  who  gives  valuable  consideration
and  has  no  actual  or  constructive  notice  of  the  prior
instrument)  prevails  over  a  prior  grantee  who  failed  to
record.  If  the  creditor  was  trying  to  become  covered  by  the
recording  act,  and  the  buyer  had  been  in  possession  at  the
time the creditor filed her lien, the fact that the buyer (not the
seller,  who  was  the  record  owner)  was  in  possession  at  the
date of lien filing might have been enough to cause the buyer
to  lose,  since  this  possession  might  have  put  her  on  inquiry
notice that the seller was perhaps no longer the owner. But the
fact that the seller was still in possession didn’t put the buyer
on notice of anything, so it’s irrelevant on these facts.

Choice  (D)  is  wrong,  because  recording  acts  protect  the
second, not the first, purchaser in certain circumstances. Here,
it would be the creditor (who can argue that she “purchased”
by  filing  her  lien),  not  the  buyer,  who  is  trying  to  get  the
protection  of  the  recording  act.  It  is  the  person  seeking  the
protection of the recording act (the second purchaser), not the
person  resisting  application  of  the  act  (the  first  purchaser)
who needs to be “without notice.” So here, the notice status of
the creditor might well matter (if the recording act otherwise
applied to judgment lien creditors). But the notice status of the

636

buyer, the first “purchaser,” does not matter at all.

Question  58:  Able  conveyed  Blackacre  to  Baker  by  a
warranty deed. Baker recorded the deed four days later. After
the  conveyance  but  prior  to  Baker’s  recording  of  the  deed,
Smollett properly filed a judgment against Able.

The  two  pertinent  statutes  in  the  jurisdiction  provide  the
following: 1) any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years
from  filing,  be  a  lien  on  the  real  property  then  owned  or
subsequently  acquired  by  any  person  against  whom  the
judgment  is  rendered,  and  2)  no  conveyance  or  mortgage  of
real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for
value  and  without  notice  unless  the  same  be  recorded
according to law.

The recording act has no provision for a grace period.

Smollett joined both Able and Baker in an appropriate action
to foreclose the judgment lien against Blackacre.

If Smollett is unsuccessful, it will be because
(A)    Able’s  warranty  of  title  to  Baker  defeats  Smollett’s

claim.

(B)  Smollett is not a purchaser for value.
(C)  any deed is superior to a judgment lien.
(D)    four  days  is  not  an  unreasonable  delay  in  recording  a

deed.

Answer 58: Choice (B) is correct. Smollett could win only if
he  were  protected  by  the  recording  act.  This  is  so  because
without the recording act’s protection, Smollet would have to
lose  since  Baker  received  his  conveyance  before  Smollett
filed his lien (meaning that Able no longer had any interest in
the property at the moment Smollett’s judgment became a lien
on Able’s “property” by means of Smollett’s filing). In most
jurisdictions,  if  the  recording  act  protects  only  “purchasers
for  value,”  a  judgment  creditor  will  not  be  deemed  to  be  a
“purchaser.” So if Smollett were found not to be a purchaser,
and therefore not to receive any protection from the recording
act, he would lose. It is not certain that the recording act here
would be interpreted so as to not protect lien creditors, but of
the four choices, this is the only one that could plausibly yield

637

a defeat for Smollett.

(A) is wrong because Able’s warranty of title to Baker might
help Baker in a suit against Able, but would not help Baker in
a  suit  against  Smollett.  Where  a  party  (here,  Baker)  doesn’t
record immediately (or within the applicable grace period if
any), nothing in that party’s deed can save her from losing to a
subsequent  purchaser  for  value  who  is  protected  by  the
recording  act.  (That’s  the  purpose  of  recording  acts — to
protect subsequent purchasers for value, and to allow them to
rely on the record as of the time of the subsequent purchase.)

(C)  is  wrong  because  it  is  a  gross  misstatement  of  law,
especially  the  law  of  the  jurisdiction  in  question  here.  The
first statute cited in the question gives a filed judgment a lien
against all real property then owned by the judgment debtor;
so  if  the  judgment  had  been  filed  before  the  conveyance  to
Baker, the judgment lien would indeed be superior to Baker’s
deed (which this choice says could never happen).

(D) is wrong because, when a recording act does not have a
grace  period,  the  purchaser  takes  the  risk  of  a  subsequent
purchaser’s  gaining  rights  in  the  gap  between  the  first
conveyance  and  a  recording  of  that  conveyance,  no  matter
how  small  this  gap  is.  (If  there  had  been  a  grace  period  of
more  than  four  days,  this  choice  would  have  been  a  good
explanation of why Smollett would lose.)

C.  Recording first in a race or race-notice state

landowner  mortgaged 

Question  59:  A  landowner  owned  a  piece  of  land  in  fee
simple of record on January 10. On that day, a bank loaned the
the
the 
landowner  $50,000  and 
property  to  the  bank  as  security  for  the  loan.  The  mortgage
was recorded on January 18.
The  landowner  conveyed  the  property  to  an  investor  for  a
valuable consideration on January 11. The bank did not know
of this, nor did the investor know of the mortgage to the bank,
until  both  discovered  the  facts  on  January  23,  the  day  on
which the investor recorded his deed from the landowner.
jurisdiction  provides:  “No
the 
The  recording  act  of 
unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be
good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice,

638

who shall first record.” There is no provision for a period of
grace and there is no other relevant statutory provision.

The bank sued the investor to establish that its mortgage was
good against the property.

The court should decide for

(A)    the  investor,  because  he  paid  valuable  consideration
without notice before the bank recorded its mortgage.
(B)  the investor, because the bank’s delay in recording means
that it is estopped from asserting its priority in time.
(C)    the  bank,  because  the  investor  did  not  record  his  deed

(D) 

before the mortgage was recorded.
  the  bank,  because  after  the  mortgage  to  it,  the
landowner’s  deed  to  the  investor  was  necessarily
subject to the mortgage.

Answer  59:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  This  is  a  race  notice
statute,  since  it  says  that  it  protects  only  “subsequent
purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.”
Therefore, the investor could only obtain the protection of the
recording statute if he recorded before the prior interest (the
bank’s  mortgage)  was  recorded.  Since  the  bank  recorded  on
Jan. 18 and the investor on Jan. 23, the investor did not satisfy
the record-first requirement. Therefore, the recording act does
not apply, and the bank wins under the common-law principle
that  the  first-in-time  conveyance  takes  priority  over  the
second conveyance.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  while  the  investor’s  paying  valuable
consideration  and  taking  without  notice  prior  to  the  bank’s
recording were necessary elements for him to be covered by
the recording act, they were not sufficient elements — he was
also required to record first.
(B)  is  wrong  because  there  is  no  principle  of  estoppel  by
which a party who delays in recording loses the right to rely
on the recording act; the only risk taken by the delaying party
is that during the delay, a subsequent purchaser may meet the
requirements for protection under the recording act.
(D) is wrong because it gives an incorrect explanation for the
correct result: After the bank received its mortgage, it would

639

still  lose  to  a  subsequent  purchaser  for  value  without  notice
who beat it to the recording office.

III.  PURCHASER MUST TAKE “WITHOUT

NOTICE”

A.  Notice to subsequent claimants

1.  Record notice

a.  Imputed knowledge

i.  Mortgage and note

Question  60:  A  landowner  executed  and  delivered  a
promissory  note  and  a  mortgage  securing  the  note  to  a
mortgage company, which was named as payee in the note and
as  mortgagee  in  the  mortgage.  The  note  included  a  statement
that  the  indebtedness  evidenced  by  the  note  was  “subject  to
the terms of a contract between the maker and the payee of the
note executed on the same day” and that the note was “secured
by a mortgage of even date.” The mortgage was promptly and
properly recorded. Subsequently, the mortgage company sold
the landowner’s note and mortgage to a bank and delivered to
the  bank  a  written  assignment  of  the  note  and  mortgage.  The
assignment  was  promptly  and  properly  recorded.  The
mortgage  company  retained  possession  of  both  the  note  and
the mortgage in order to act as collecting agent. Later, being
short  of  funds,  the  mortgage  company  sold  the  note  and
mortgage  to  an  investor  at  a  substantial  discount.  The
mortgage company executed a written assignment of the note
and mortgage to the investor and delivered to him the note, the
mortgage, and the assignment. The investor paid value for the
assignment without actual knowledge of the prior assignment
to  the  bank  and  promptly  and  properly  recorded  his
assignment.  The  principal  of  the  note  was  not  then  due,  and
there  had  been  no  default  in  payment  of  either  interest  or
principal.
If  the  issue  of  ownership  of  the  landowner’s  note  and
mortgage  is  subsequently  raised  in  an  appropriate  action  by
the bank to foreclose, the court should hold that

640

(A)  the investor owns both the note and the mortgage.
(B)  the bank owns both the note and the mortgage.
(C)    the  investor  owns  the  note  and  the  bank  owns  the

mortgage.

(D)    the  bank  owns  the  note  and  the  investor  owns  the

mortgage.

title.  When 

the  bank  promptly  recorded 

Answer  60:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  bank  was  the  first
grantee of both the note and the mortgage, so the bank is the
owner  unless  the  recording  act  somehow  gave  the  investor
superior 
the
assignment to it of the note and mortgage, the bank complied
with all requirements of the recording act. Therefore, no later
assignment  by  the  mortgage  company  to  the  investor  (or
anyone else) could take priority, under the recording act, over
the  assignment  to  the  bank.  The  fact  that  the  investor  paid
value  for  his  assignment,  and  without  actual  notice  of  the
prior assignment to the bank, doesn’t change any of this — the
investor  is  deemed  to  be  on  notice  of  what  a  proper  record
search  would  have  indicated,  and  here  a  search  of  the
mortgage  company  in  the  records  would  have  disclosed  the
prior  assignment  to  the  bank.  Similarly,  the  fact  that  the
mortgage  company  kept  possession  of  the  note  and  mortgage
after  assigning  these  to  the  bank  makes  no  difference;  the
investor  as  second  grantee  cannot  take  priority  over  a  prior
conveyance that was properly recorded.

(A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  they  are  inconsistent
with the above analysis.

B.  Purchaser from one without notice

1.  Donee from person protected by act

Question 61: A grantor who owned a parcel conveyed it by
quitclaim deed as a gift to a woman, who did not then record
her deed. Later, the grantor conveyed the parcel by warranty
deed  to  a  man,  who  paid  valuable  consideration,  knew
nothing  of  the  woman’s  claim,  and  promptly  and  properly
recorded. Next, the woman recorded her deed. Then the man
conveyed the parcel by quitclaim deed to his nephew as a gift.
When the possible conflict with the woman was discovered,
the nephew recorded his deed.

641

The  parcel  at  all  relevant  times  has  been  vacant  unoccupied
land.

The recording act of the jurisdiction provides:

“No  unrecorded  conveyance  or  mortgage  of  real  property
shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without
notice, who shall first record.” No other statute is applicable.

The  nephew  has  sued  the  woman  to  establish  who  owns  the
parcel.

The court will hold for

(A)  the nephew, because the woman was a donee.
(B)    the  nephew,  because  the  man’s  purchase  cut  off  the

woman’s rights.

(C)  the woman, because she recorded before the nephew.
(D)  the woman, because the nephew was a subsequent donee.
Answer  61:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  man  met  all  the
requirements  of  the  recording  statute:  He  took  for  value,  he
took without notice of the prior conveyance, and he recorded
before the prior conveyance was recorded. Once the man met
those  requirements,  his  interest  cut  off  all  rights  of  the  prior
grantee  (the  woman)  who  didn’t  record  first.  The  man
therefore  had  the  ability  to  pass  a  valid  title  to  his  nephew,
even  though  the  nephew  did  not  take  for  value,  and  even
though the nephew was on record notice of the woman’s claim
at the time he took (since by then the woman had recorded).

(A) is wrong because it is not the woman’s status as a donee
that  causes  her  to  lose,  it  is  the  fact  that  she  did  not  record
before a subsequent BFP (the man) recorded. Remember that
under recording acts, it is never significant whether the first
grantee took for value; it only matters whether the subsequent
grantee, who is trying to take advantage of the recording act,
took for value.
(C) is wrong because the fact that the woman recorded before
the  nephew  cannot  save  her;  once  a  subsequent  grantee  (the
man)  took  for  value  and  without  notice  and  then  recorded
first,  a  person  downstream  from  that  subsequent  grantee  (the
late-filing  grantee
nephew)  wins  against 
regardless of whether the downstreamer took for value, took

the  original 

642

without notice, or recorded first.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  the  nephew  did  not  give
value doesn’t matter; as with Choice (C), once the subsequent
grantee  (the  man)  got  the  protection  of  the  recording  act,  it
doesn’t  matter  whether  a  person  downstream  from  him  gave
value, recorded first, or took without notice.

2.  Lender to person protected by act

Question  62:  Five  years  ago,  an  investor  who  owned  a
vacant  lot  in  a  residential  area  borrowed  $25,000  from  a
friend  and  gave  the  friend  a  note  for  $25,000  due  in  five
years, secured by a mortgage on the lot. The friend neglected
to record the mortgage. The fair market value of the lot was
then $25,000.

Three  years  ago,  the  investor  discovered  that  the  friend  had
not  recorded  his  mortgage  and  in  consideration  of  $50,000
conveyed  the  lot  to  a  buyer.  The  fair  market  value  of  the  lot
was  then  $50,000.  The  buyer  knew  nothing  of  the  friend’s
mortgage. One month thereafter, the friend discovered the sale
to the buyer, recorded his $25,000 mortgage, and notified the
buyer that he held a $25,000 mortgage on the lot.

Two years ago, the buyer needed funds. Although she told her
bank  of  the  mortgage  claimed  by  the  investor’s  friend,  the
bank  loaned  her  $15,000,  and  she  gave  the  bank  a  note  for
$15,000  due  in  two  years  secured  by  a  mortgage  on  the  lot.
The  bank  promptly  and  properly  recorded  the  mortgage.  At
that time, the fair market value of the lot was $75,000.

the 

The  recording  act  of 
jurisdiction  provides:  “No
conveyance  or  mortgage  of  real  property  shall  be  good
against  subsequent  purchasers  for  value  and  without  notice
unless the same be recorded according to law.”
Both  notes  are  now  due  and  both  the  investor  and  the  buyer
have refused to pay. The lot is now worth only $50,000.
What are the rights of the investor’s friend and the bank in the
lot?
(A)  Both mortgages are enforceable liens and the friend’s has

priority because it was first recorded.

(B)  Both mortgages are enforceable liens, but the bank’s has

643

priority because the buyer was an innocent purchaser for
value.

(C)  Only the friend’s mortgage is an enforceable lien, because
the  bank  had  actual  and  constructive  notice  of  the
investor’s fraud.

(D)  Only the bank’s mortgage is an enforceable lien, because

the buyer was an innocent purchaser for value.

Answer 62: Choice (D) is correct. This is a complicated fact
pattern,  but  the  essential  information  is  that  the  buyer
purchased the lot from the investor before the friend recorded
his mortgage. Thus, (1) the buyer was a bona fide purchaser
(BFP) for value and is protected by the recording statute; and
(2) the bank who lent to the buyer is also protected despite the
fact that the buyer knew of the prior mortgage when it lent.

The jurisdiction’s recording act is a “notice” statute because
it  provides,  “No  conveyance  or  mortgage  of  real  property
shall  be  good  against  subsequent  purchasers  for  value  and
without notice unless same be recorded according to law.” A
notice  statute  protects  only  a  subsequent  taker  who  takes  for
value and without notice of the prior conveyance or mortgage.
(Because this is a pure notice rather than race-notice statute,
the subsequent taker doesn’t have to have recorded before the
prior  grantee  or  mortgagee  records.)  Notice  can  be  actual,
record, or inquiry. The facts do not indicate that the buyer had
actual notice of the friend’s mortgage. Since the friend had not
recorded the mortgage at the time the buyer purchased the lot,
the buyer did not have record notice. Finally, the property is a
vacant lot; so even if the buyer had inspected the property, she
would  not  have  been  put  on  inquiry  notice  of  the  friend’s
mortgage. Thus, the buyer is a BFP (i.e., she took without any
kind  of  notice)  and  receives  the  protection  of  the  recording
act.  Therefore,  the  friend’s  lien  is  unenforceable  against  the
buyer (or against anyone who deals with her, as we’ll see in a
minute).
The bank’s mortgage, on the other hand, is an enforceable lien
against  the  property,  because  the  buyer  is  a  party  to  the
mortgage  and  the  bank  promptly  and  properly  recorded  the
mortgage. (Even if you did not know this, you would be able
to  pick  the  correct  answer  by  eliminating  the  other  three

644

choices, which all rely on the friend’s having an enforceable
lien.)

And the fact that the bank made its loan while having notice
(both  actual  and  record)  of  the  prior  mortgage  to  the  friend
does not prevent the bank’s mortgage from being a valid first
lien — that’s  because  the  buyer  took  free  of  the  friend’s
mortgage for the reasons described above, and once the buyer
had  this  free-and-clear  title  she  was  entitled  to  place  a  first
mortgage  on  it  (or  re-sell  it)  regardless  of  the  state  of
knowledge possessed by the new mortgagee (or new buyer).
If the rule were otherwise, an innocent buyer would never be
able to take out a first mortgage or re-sell, if the holder of a
prior 
interest  who  didn’t  record  promptly  eventually
recorded, as happened here.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  for  the  reasons  explained  in  the
analysis of Choice (D), the friend did not have an enforceable
lien  against  the  property.  Thus,  the  fact  that  the  friend
recorded before the bank is irrelevant.

(B)  is  wrong  because,  for  the  reasons  explained  in  the
analysis of Choice (D), the friend did not have an enforceable
lien  against  the  property.  This  answer  choice  misstates  the
significance  of  the  buyer’s  being  an  innocent  purchaser  for
value.  The  buyer’s  BFP  status  protects  her  from  the
enforcement  of  the  friend’s  lien;  it  does  not  affect  the
“priority” of the liens (since there is only one valid lien, the
bank’s).

(C)  is  wrong  because,  for  the  reasons  explained  in  the
analysis of Choice (D), the friend did not have an enforceable
lien  against  the  property.  The  friend  recorded  too  late  to
prevent the buyer from being a BFP; so, the fact that the buyer
later  learned  of  the  friend’s  mortgage  is  of  no  consequence 
— the  buyer  took  free  of  the  friend’s  mortgage.  Once  the
buyer had this free-and-clear title, she was entitled to place a
first  mortgage  on  it  (or  sell  it)  regardless  of  the  state  of
knowledge possessed by the new mortgagee (or new buyer).
Such  a  rule  is  necessary  to  protect  the  innocent  buyer’s
financing  and  resale  market.  See  the  analysis  of  Choice  (D)
for more about this.

CHAPTER 9
RIGHTS INCIDENT TO LAND

I.    NUISANCE

A.  Private nuisance

1.  Failure to abate

Question 63:  A  homeowner  and  his  neighbor  own  adjacent
lots  in  fee  simple.  The  homeowner  has  kept  the  lawns  and
trees  on  his  property  trimmed  and  neat.  His  neighbor  ‘‘lets
nature  take  its  course’’  on  her  property.  As  a  result,  the
neighbor’s  lawn  is  a  tangle  of  underbrush,  fallen  trees,  and
standing trees that are in danger of losing limbs. Many of the
trees  on  the  neighbor’s  land  are  near  the  homeowner’s
property. In the past, debris and large limbs have been blown
from the neighbor’s property onto the homeowner’s. By local
standards  the  neighbor’s  lot  is  an  eyesore  that  depresses
market values of real property in the vicinity, but its condition
violates no applicable laws or ordinances.

The  homeowner  demanded  that  his  neighbor  keep  the  trees
near  his  property  trimmed.  The  neighbor  refused.  The
homeowner  brought  an  appropriate  action  against  his
neighbor  to  require  her  to  abate  what  he  alleges  to  be  a
nuisance.  In  the  lawsuit,  the  only  issue  is  whether  the
condition  of  the  neighbor’s  property  constitutes  a  nuisance.
The  strongest  argument  that  the  homeowner  can  present,  if
factually correct, is that the condition of his neighbor’s lot

(A)  has an adverse impact on real estate values.
(B)  poses a danger to the occupants of the homeowner’s lot.
(C)  violates community aesthetic standards.
(D)    cannot  otherwise  be  challenged  under  any  law  or

ordinance.

Answer  63:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Normally,  an  owner’s
refusal  to  abate  a  naturally-occurring  condition  on  his  land
will  not  be  deemed  to  be  a  nuisance.  But  nearly  all  courts
have long recognized an exception for trees that pose the risk
of  falling  on  the  public  highway,  and  some  courts  have

646

extended  this  exception  to  trees  that  pose  a  risk  of  physical
danger  to  those  on  adjacent  non-highway  property.  A  court
would  not  necessarily  find  that  the  risk  of  danger  from  the
fallen  trees  makes  the  condition  a  nuisance,  but  of  the  four
choices  this  is  the  only  one  that  could  plausibly  lead  to  a
finding of nuisance.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  while  impact  on  real  estate  values
might  a  reason  for  holding  that  a  man-made  feature  poses  a
nuisance, it would not be grounds for overruling the usual rule
that  failure  to  abate  a  naturally-occurring  condition  is  a
nuisance.

(C) is wrong for the same reason as (A): While a violation of
community aesthetic standards might be a reason for holding
that  a  man-made  feature  poses  a  nuisance,  it  would  not  be
grounds  for  overruling  the  usual  rule  that  failure  to  abate  a
naturally-occurring condition is not a nuisance.

it 

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  a  condition  cannot  be
challenged by any other law or ordinance does not mean that
the  court  will  find 
to  constitute  a  nuisance — the
homeowner will have to show that the conditions here cause
him  a  substantial  interference  with  his  use  and  enjoyment  of
his property, and the fact that the condition doesn’t violate a
law  or  ordinance  doesn’t  say  anything  about  whether  the
homeowner can meet this standard.

II.   WATER RIGHTS

A.  Drainage of surface waters

1.  When party wants to get rid of the water

Question 64: A rancher and a farmer own adjacent tracts of
rural land. For the past nine years, the rancher has impounded
on  her  land  the  water  that  resulted  from  rain  and  melting
snow,  much  of  which  flowed  from  the  farmer’s  land.  The
rancher  uses  the  water  in  her  livestock  operation.  Recently,
the  farmer  increased  the  size  of  his  farming  operation  and
built  a  dam  on  his  land  near  the  boundary  between  the  two
tracts. Because of the dam, these waters no longer drain from
the  farmer’s  land  onto  the  rancher’s  land.  There  is  no

647

applicable statute. The rancher sued the farmer to restrain him
from  interfering  with  the  natural  flow  of  the  water  onto  her
land.

Who is likely to prevail?

(A)    The  farmer,  because  he  has  the  right  to  use  all  of  the

water impounded on his land.

(B)    The  farmer,  because  the  rancher’s  past  impoundment  of
water  estops  her  from  asserting  the  illegality  of  the
farmer’s dam.

(C)  The rancher, because she has acquired riparian rights to

use the water.

(D)  The rancher, because the farmer is estopped to claim all

of the surface water on his land.

Answer  64:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  This  water  is  diffuse
surface  water.  Although  there  are  three  different  views
regarding  the  way  an  owner  may  expel  such  water  if  he
doesn’t  want  it,  there  is  only  one  view  about  whether  the
owner may impound it if he does want it: The rule is that an
owner such as the farmer may impound all such water, at least
in the absence of any malice (and there is none here).

(B) is wrong because although this option correctly concludes
that the farmer will prevail, it misstates the reason why this is
so.  At  least  in  the  absence  of  malice,  either  landowner  may
impound diffuse surface waters, and that would be true even
if  the  other  party  hadn’t  also  previously  impounded  (so  that
the doctrine of estoppel doesn’t apply).

(C)  is  wrong  because  water  from  melting  snows  and  rain  is
diffuse  surface  water.  Riparian  waters  are  waters  with
defined  beds  and  banks,  such  as  streams,  rivers,  and  lakes,
and a riparian owner is one whose land borders such waters.
Here, the only water at issue is diffuse surface water, and the
rule  for  such  waters  is  as  stated  in  the  discussion  of  Choice
(A).
(D)  is  wrong  because  as  described  above,  either  party  may
impound  surface  waters  that  are  on  his  own  land,  and  the
doctrine  of  estoppel  would  not  apply  to  change  this  general
rule.

648

III.  AIR RIGHTS

A.  Other air-rights issues

1.  Right to sunlight

Question  65:  Pauline  and  Doris  own  adjacent  parcels  of
land. On each of their parcels was a low-rise office building.
The two office buildings were of the same height.

Last  year  Doris  decided  to  demolish  the  low-rise  office
building  on  her  parcel  and  to  erect  a  new  high-rise  office
building  of  substantially  greater  height  on  the  parcel  as
permitted by the zoning and building ordinances. She secured
all  the  governmental  approvals  necessary  to  pursue  her
project.

As  Doris’s  new  building  was  in  the  course  of  construction,
Pauline realized that the shadows it would create would place
her  (Pauline’s)  building  in  such  deep  shade  that  the  rent  she
could charge for space in her building would be substantially
reduced.

Pauline brought an appropriate action against Doris to enjoin
the construction in order to eliminate the shadow problem and
for damages. Pauline presented uncontroverted evidence that
her evaluation as to the impact of the shadow on the fair rental
value  of  her  building  was  correct.  There  is  no  statute  or
ordinance (other than the building and zoning ordinances) that
is applicable to the issues before the court.

The court should

(A)  grant to Pauline the requested injunction.
(B)    award  Pauline  damages  measured  by  the  loss  of  rental

value, but not an injunction.

(C)  grant judgment for Doris, because she had secured all the
necessary governmental approvals for the new building.
(D)    grant  judgment  for  Doris,  because  Pauline  has  no  legal
right to have sunshine continue to reach the windows of
her building.

Answer 65: Choice (D) is correct. A landowner has no legal
right  to  have  sunlight  continue  to  reach  her  building.  For
example, it is not a nuisance for one owner to block another

649

owner’s  access  to  sunlight,  even  if  the  consequence  of  the
blockage  is  to  reduce  the  latter  building’s  rental  or  market
value.

Since  Doris  has  done  nothing  wrong,  both  (A)  and  (B)  are
incorrect.

Although (C) states the right result, the fact that Doris secured
all  necessary  government  approvals  is  not  dispositive;  for
instance, if the government-approved building built by Doris
had  released  noxious  odors  that  substantially  impaired  the
value  of  Pauline’s  building,  the  fact  that  Doris  had  obtained
all  necessary  permits  would  not  be  a  defense  to  Pauline’s
nuisance suit.

Question 66:  The  plaintiff  and  the  defendant  own  adjoining
lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an
office  building.  The  defendant  decided  to  raze  the  existing
building  on  her  lot  and  to  erect  a  building  of  greater  height.
The defendant received all governmental approvals required
to  pursue  her  project.  There  is  no  applicable  statute  or
ordinance  (other  than  those  dealing  with  various  approvals
for zoning, building, etc.).
The defendant constructed her new building without incident.
However,  when  it  was  completed,  the  plaintiff  discovered
that the shadow created by the new higher building placed the
plaintiff’s building in such deep shade that her ability to lease
space was diminished and that the rent she could charge and
the  occupancy  rate  were  substantially  lower.  Assume  that
these  facts  are  proved  in  an  appropriate  action  the  plaintiff
instituted  against  the  defendant  for  all  and  any  relief
available.
Which  of  the  following  is  the  most  appropriate  comment
concerning this lawsuit?
(A)    The  plaintiff  is  entitled  to  a  mandatory  injunction
requiring  the  defendant  to  restore  conditions  to  those
existing with the prior building insofar as the shadow is
concerned.

(B)  The court should award permanent damages, in lieu of an
injunction, equal to the present value of all rents lost and
loss on rents for the reasonable life of the building.

650

(C)    The  court  should  award  damages  for  losses  suffered  to
the  date  of  trial  and  leave  open  recovery  of  future
damages.

(D)    Judgment  should  be  for  the  defendant,  because  the

plaintiff has no cause of action.

Answer 66: Choice (D) is correct. A landowner has no legal
right  to  have  sunlight  continue  to  reach  her  building.
Therefore,  it  is  not  a  nuisance  or  other  violation  for  one
owner to block another owner’s access to sunlight, even if the
consequence of the blockage is to reduce the latter building’s
rental or market value.

Since the defendant has done nothing wrong, (A), (B), and (C)
are all incorrect.

I.    BATTERY

A.  Intent

1.  Intent to create apprehension of contact

a.  Prank gone bad

Question 1: A golfer was annoyed that his caddie was joking
about the golfer’s bad last shot. The golfer swung his newly-
purchased  golf  club  in  the  direction  of  the  caddie’s  head,
intending to frighten the caddie but not to hit him. The caddie
started  to  duck  to  avoid  the  blow.  The  golfer  stopped  his
swing so that the club would not have hit the caddie, except
that  due  to  the  club  manufacturer’s  negligence  the  club  head
flew  off  and  hit  the  caddie  in  the  top  of  the  head,  seriously
injuring him. The caddie will be able to recover for:
(A)  assault but not battery.
(B)  battery but not assault.
(C)  assault and battery.
(D)  neither battery nor assault.
Answer  1:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  This  is  both  assault  and
battery.  Here,  we’re  concerned  just  with  battery.  Battery
occurs when the defendant, with the intention of causing either
a harmful or offensive contact or an imminent apprehension of
such  a  contact,  causes  a  harmful  contact  with  the  plaintiff.
Rest. 2d, §13. The golfer had the requisite intention to induce
apprehension  of  an  imminent  harmful  or  offensive  contact,
even  though  the  golfer  did  not  in  fact  intend  to  make  such  a
contact.  Since  a  harmful  contact  with  the  caddie’s  person
resulted,  the  required  result  for  battery  also  occurred,  so  all
elements of battery have been satisfied. The fact that the club
manufacturer’s negligence was a but-for cause of the harmful
contact won’t act as a superseding cause; in intentional torts
(as  opposed  to  negligence,  for  instance),  an  intervening  act

654

caused  by  negligence  won’t  supersede  unless  it  is  totally
bizarre  and  unforeseeable,  and  a  clubhead  flying  off  is
unusual  but  not  unforeseeable  (especially  in  the  case  of  a
newly-purchased  club).  Cf.  Rest.  2d,  §16,  Illustr.  2.  Notice,
by  the  way,  that  if  what  had  resulted  was  merely  an
“offensive”  but  not  harmful  contact  (e.g.,  a  light  tap  on  the
caddie’s  head),  this  would  not  be  enough  for  battery — 
whereas 
to  create  an
intent  for  battery  can  be 
apprehension  of  either  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact,  the
result  required  for  battery  must  be  harmful,  not  merely
offensive. See Rest. 2d, §13(b).

the 

Choices  (A),  (B),  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  they  are
inconsistent with the above analysis.

Question 2:  Peter  and  Donald  were  in  the  habit  of  playing
practical jokes on each other on their respective birthdays. On
Peter’s  birthday,  Donald  sent  Peter  a  cake  containing  an
ingredient that he knew had, in the past, made Peter very ill.
After Peter had eaten a piece of the cake, he suffered severe
stomach  pains  and  had  to  be  taken  to  the  hospital  by
ambulance. On the way to the hospital, the ambulance driver
suffered a heart attack, which caused the ambulance to swerve
from the road and hit a tree. As a result of the collision, Peter
suffered a broken leg.
In  a  suit  by  Peter  against  Donald  to  recover  damages  for
Peter’s broken leg, Peter will

(A)    prevail,  because  Donald  knew  that  the  cake  would  be

harmful or offensive to Peter.

(B)  prevail, only if the ambulance driver was negligent.
(C)    not  prevail,  because  Donald  could  not  reasonably  be

expected to foresee injury to Peter’s leg.

(D)  not prevail, because the ambulance driver’s heart attack

was a superseding cause of Peter’s broken leg.

Answer  2:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Battery  is  the  intentional
infliction of a harmful or offensive bodily contact. Rest 2d §§
13,  18.  Once  it  is  established  that  the  defendant  intended  to
commit  a  harmful  or  offensive  touching  and  such  a  contact
occurred, the defendant is liable for any consequences which
ensue,  even  though  he  did  not  intend  them,  and  in  fact  could

655

not reasonably have foreseen them.

(B)      is  incorrect  because  the  issue  of  proximate  cause,  not
is  determinative  of  Donald’s
Driver’s  negligence, 
liability. Donald is liable if his tortious conduct was the
(or “a”) proximate cause of Peter’s injury, and that’s true
regardless  of  whether  the  ambulance  driver  was  also
negligent.

(C)      is  wrong  because  it  is  both  legally  and  factually
incorrect. Peter’s suit would have to be either for battery
or  negligence,  and  in  neither  of  these  cases  does
foreseeability supply a defense. In a suit for battery, the
tortfeasor  will  be  liable  for  virtually  every  result
stemming directly or even somewhat indirectly from his
conduct,  however  unlikely  it  might  have  seemed  at  the
time of his act that this result would follow. Rest. 2d, §
435B.  In  a  negligence  suit,  the  defendant  will  be  held
liable  only  for  those  consequences  that  were  at  least
somewhat foreseeable.

(D)      is  wrong  because  an  accident  in  the  ambulance  on  the
way to the hospital that would cause Peter injury was not
so unexpected that it would be a superseding cause. Only
an intervening cause that is so unlikely as to be bizarre
will  be  deemed  “superseding.”  Negligence  of  rescue
professionals  and  medical  professionals  is  sufficiently
foreseeable (even if unlikely) that it will almost never be
deemed superseding.

2.  D must intend contact

Question  3:  Plaintiff,  a  jockey,  was  seriously  injured  in  a
race when another jockey, Daring, cut too sharply in front of
her  without  adequate  clearance.  The  two  horses  collided,
causing  Plaintiff  to  fall  to  the  ground,  sustaining  injury.  The
State  Racetrack  Commission  ruled  that,  by  cutting  in  too
sharply,  Daring  committed  a  foul  in  violation  of  racetrack
lanes.
rules  requiring  adequate  clearance  for  crossing 
Plaintiff has brought an action against Daring for damages in
which one count is based on battery.
Will Plaintiff prevail on the battery claim?
(A)  Yes, if Daring was reckless in cutting across in front of

656

Plaintiff’s horse.

(B)  Yes, because the State Racetrack Commission determined
that  Daring  committed  a  foul  in  violation  of  rules
applicable to racing.

(C)    No,  unless  Daring  intended  to  cause  impermissible
contact between the two horses or apprehension of such
contact by Plaintiff.

(D)    No,  because  Plaintiff  assumed  the  risk  of  accidental
injury inherent in riding as a jockey in a horse race.
Answer  3:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Battery  is  the  intentional
infliction of a harmful or offensive bodily contact. An assault
is  the  intentional  causing  of  an  apprehension  of  harmful  or
offensive  contact.  The  intent  necessary  for  a  battery  is  the
intent to make contact with the plaintiff or the intent to commit
an  assault  with  a  resulting  accidental  “harmful  or  offensive
contact.”  A  battery  may  be  committed  not  only  by  a  contact
with the plaintiff’s body, but also by contact with anything that
is so closely identified with her body that contact with it is as
offensive  as  contact  with  the  body  would  be.  Rest  2d  §18,
Comment c. Therefore, Plaintiff will not prevail on the battery
claim unless Daring intended to cause either contact between
the horses or apprehension of such by Plaintiff.

(A)   is wrong because a reckless intent is not sufficient to be
liable  for  battery.  If  Daring  acted  recklessly  (i.e.,  in
deliberate disregard of a high probability that the result
would occur) this is a broader mental state than what is
required  in  a  case  of  battery — that  the  defendant  must
desire a certain outcome and also know with substantial
certainty that the result will occur.

(B)   is wrong because the fact that Daring violated the racing
rule  requiring  adequate  clearance  for  crossing  lanes  by
itself does not show that he had the requisite intent to be
liable for battery. Only if the intent as described in (C)
was present, may Daring be liable for battery.

(D)      is  wrong  because  the  doctrine  of  assumption  of  risk
would  not  apply  in  this  context,  where  the  injury  was
intentional. A plaintiff is said to have assumed the risk of
certain  harm  if  he  has  voluntarily  consented  to  take  his
chances  that  that  harm  will  occur.  Within  the  context  of

657

sports,  if  the  risk  of  the  sort  of  injury  that  occurred  is
inherent in the sport or activity, then the plaintiff will be
blocked  from  recovering  based  on  application  of  the
doctrine.  However,  courts  now  hold  that,  in  co-
participant  sports,  although  ordinary  carelessness  is
inherent  in  the  game,  a  defendant  who  intentionally
injures a participant will be held liable and the doctrine
will not apply.
3.  Must intend contact with a “person”

Question 4:  Peavey  was  walking  peacefully  along  a  public
street when he encountered Dorwin, whom he had never seen
before. Without provocation or warning, Dorwin picked up a
rock  and  struck  Peavey  with  it.  It  was  later  established  that
Dorwin  was  mentally

ill 
hallucinations.

suffered 

and 

If  Peavey  asserts  a  claim  against  Dorwin  based  on  battery,
which  of  the  following,  if  supported  by  evidence,  will  be
Dorwin’s best defense?
(A)  Dorwin did not understand that his act was wrongful.
(B)  Dorwin did not desire to cause harm to Peavey.
(C)  Dorwin did not know that he was striking a person.
(D)  Dorwin thought Peavey was about to attack him.
Answer  4:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Battery  is  the  intentional
infliction  of  a  harmful  or  offensive  bodily  contact.  Rest.  2d
§13. An insane person is capable of forming the intent to do a
harmful  act,  and  the  fact  that  the  insanity  may  have  been  the
cause of the intent is irrelevant. Rest. 2d § 895J. However, if
Dorwin didn’t know he was striking a person, then he in fact
did  not  have  the  requisite  intent  to  inflict  a  harmful  or
offensive bodily contact on Peavey. Therefore, this would be
his best defense in Peavey’s claim for battery.
(A)   is wrong because it is irrelevant whether or not Dorwin
understood that his act was wrongful; he only needed to
intend to cause an offensive bodily contact in order to be
liable for battery.

(B)   is wrong because it is not required that Dorwin wished
to  cause  harm  to  the  plaintiff,  only  that  he  wished  to
inflict  an  offensive  contact,  i.e.,  one  damaging  to  a

658

“reasonable sense of dignity.”

(D)      is  wrong  because  if  Dorwin  struck  Peavey  because  he
mistakenly  and  unreasonably  thought  Peavey  was  about
to attack him, he still had the requisite intent to inflict an
offensive  bodily  contact  on  Peavey.  And  although  a
reasonable mistake about the need for self-defense will
be a defense to battery, an unreasonable mistake will not.
Here, the facts indicate that if Dorwin believed Peavey
was  attacking  him,  that  belief  was  based  on  Dorwin’s
hallucinations,  which  would  make 
the  mistake
“unreasonable.” (Courts apply an objective standard for
reasonableness of mistake, i.e., a standard that does not
take  into  account  the  defendant’s  particular  mental
peculiarities or defects.)

1.  Contact beyond level consented to

Question 5:  A  professional  football  player  signed  a  written
consent for his team’s physician to perform a knee operation.
After the player was under a general anesthetic, the physician
asked  a  world-famous  orthopedic  surgeon  to  perform  the
operation.  The  surgeon’s  skills  were  superior 
the
physician’s, and the operation was successful.

to 

In an action for battery by the player against the surgeon, the
player will

(A)    prevail,  because  the  player  did  not  agree  to  allow  the

surgeon to perform the operation.

(B)  prevail, because the consent form was in writing.
(C)  not prevail, because the surgeon’s skills were superior to

the physician’s.

(D)  not prevail, because the operation was successful.
Answer 5: The correct Choice is (A). The essence of battery
is  lack  of  consent,  and  the  plaintiff  did  not  consent  to  the
surgeon’s performing the operation. Consent is a defense to a
tortious  interference  with  a  plaintiff’s  person  or  property.
Even  if  the  plaintiff  gives  actual  consent  to  some  type  of
invasion of his interests, the defendant will not be privileged
if  she  goes  substantially  beyond  the  scope  of  consent  and

659

invades  the  plaintiff’s  interests  in  a  way  that  is  substantially
different  than  what  was  consented  to.  Under  these  facts,  the
plaintiff  specifically  consented  in  writing  to  having  the
operation  performed  by  the  team  physician.  The  team
physician’s  decision  to  have  the  surgeon  perform  the
operation  exceeded  the  scope  of  the  plaintiff’s  original
consent. It doesn’t matter that the surgeon was a world famous
orthopedic  surgeon  with  skills  better 
team
physician’s,  or  that  he  successfully  performed  the  operation 
— the plaintiff’s consent applied to the team physician, not to
the surgeon.

than 

the 

(B)  is  wrong  because  the  written  consent  form  was  for  the
team physician, not for the surgeon, to perform the operation.
A  patient’s  consent  is  read  relatively  strictly,  and  for  the
reasons discussed in (A) above would not be found to apply
to  the  surgeon,  only  to  the  team  physician.  The  fact  that  the
consent form was in writing would not change the fact that the
operation here exceeded the scope of the consent.

(C) is wrong because even if the plaintiff gives actual consent
to  some  type  of  invasion  of  his  interests,  the  defendant  will
not be privileged if she goes substantially beyond the scope of
consent  and  invades  the  plaintiff’s  interests  in  a  way  that  is
substantially  different  than  what  was  consented  to.  Here,  the
plaintiff’s  consent  was  for  the  team  physician  personally  to
perform the surgery, not for the team physician or “anyone as
good  as  or  better  than  the  team  physician.”  Therefore,  the
surgeon’s performance of the operation exceeded the scope of
the consent, and the surgeon’s better skills didn’t change this
fact.

(D)  is  wrong  because  the  success  of  the  surgery  is  not  a
defense. Here the plaintiff specifically consented in writing to
the  team  physician’s  performing  the  surgery.  The  surgeon’s
performance  of  that  surgery,  whatever  its  outcome,  went
substantially beyond the scope of the plaintiff’s consent. The
outcome of the surgery, successful or not, is not a defense to
the surgeon’s operating without consent.

Question  6:  A  customer  ordered  some  merchandise  from  a
retail store. After a dispute about payment, the store turned the
account  over  to  a  bill  collector.  The  bill  collector  called  at
the  customer’s  house  at  7  p.m.  on  a  summer  evening  while
many  of  the  customer’s  neighbors  were  seated  on  their
porches.  When  the  customer  opened  the  door,  the  bill
collector,  who  was  standing  just  outside  the  door,  raised  an
electrically  amplified  bullhorn  to  his  mouth.  In  a  voice  that
could  be  heard  a  block  away,  the  bill  collector  called  the
customer  a  “deadbeat”  and  asked  him  when  he  intended  to
pay  his  bill  to  the  store.  The  customer,  greatly  angered,
slammed  the  door  shut.  The  door  struck  the  bullhorn  and
jammed  it  forcibly  against  the  bill  collector’s  face.  As  a
consequence, the bill collector lost some of his front teeth.

If  the  bill  collector  asserts  a  claim  of  battery  against  the
customer, will the bill collector prevail?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  customer  had  not  first  asked  the  bill

collector to leave the property.

(B)  Yes, if the customer knew that the door was substantially

certain to strike the bullhorn.

(C)    No,  if  the  bill  collector’s  conduct  triggered  the

customer’s response.

(D)    No,  because  the  bill  collector  was  an  intruder  on  the

customer’s property.

Answer  6:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  A  prima  facie  claim  of
battery includes proof that defendant intended to bring about a
harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  plaintiff’s  person.  It’s  not
clear  from  these  facts  that  the  customer  intended  to  bring
about a harmful or offensive contact with the bill collector’s
person. Intent can take one of two forms: either a desire that a
certain  result  will  come  about,  or  the  substantial  certainty
that  it  will,  regardless  of  one’s  desire  that  it  do  so.  Thus,  if
the  customer  knew  that  the  door  was  substantially  certain  to
hit  the  bullhorn,  he  could  be  said  to  have  intended  that  the
contact with the bullhorn happen even if he didn’t desire that
contact.
By  the  way,  the  customer  need  not  have  intended  that  the
bullhorn in turn hit the bill collector’s teeth or some other part

661

of  his  body.  The  tort  of  battery  occurs  when  the  defendant
intends to bring about, and in fact brings about, a harmful or
offensive  touching  “of  another’s  person.”  The  “person”  of
another  includes  not  only  the  other’s  body,  but  any  item  so
connected  with  the  body  as  to  be  regarded  as  part  of  the
other’s  essence,  such  as  clothing  or  something  that  the  other
person is holding. Certainly where the bill collector was not
only  holding  the  bullhorn  but  placing  it  near  his  lips,  the
customer’s intent to create a contact that was merely with the
bullhorn would suffice even if the customer did not intend the
bullhorn  to  hit  or  harm  the  bill  collector’s  mouth.  (Also,  the
fact the contact was intended to be between the door and the
bullhorn  rather  than  between  the  customer’s  body  and  the
bullhorn would not matter — as long as the customer intended
to bring about a contact with the bill collector’s “person,” the
fact  that  there  was  some  intermediate  object,  the  door,  in
between the customer and the bill collector’s person wouldn’t
change things.)

(A)   is wrong because this might have been battery even if the
customer had first asked the bill collector to leave. This
choice  is  referring  to  the  defense  of  property,  which
requires  a  request  to  desist,  unless  it  would  be
dangerous  or  futile,  before  physical  force  is  used.  The
problem with applying this to these facts is that even if
the customer had  asked  the  bill  collector  to  leave  first,
the  physical  force 
the  customer  used  would  be
considered  excessive  and  thus  beyond  the  scope  of  his
privilege making him liable for battery.

(C)      is  wrong  because  it  does  not  offer  a  valid  defense  to
battery. This option suggests that verbal provocation is a
valid defense to battery. In fact, it’s not. If the facts were
different, and the bill collector’s taunts had prompted the
customer  to  kill  him,  the  conduct  may  be  enough  to
reduce murder to manslaughter (due to provocation), but
that’s  criminal  law.  Instead,  in  tort  law,  provocation
would have to rise to the level of justifying self defense
to  be  a  valid  defense.  And  mere  words — however
offensive — cannot  be  a  justification  for  what  would
otherwise be a battery.

662

(D)   is wrong because the fact it offers is not determinative of
the  bill  collector’s  recovery.  This  option  suggests  that
the  bill  collector’s  trespasser  status  gave  the  customer
the  privilege  to  use  the  force  he  used.  While  there  is  a
defense  based  on  defense  of  property,  there  are  two
principal  reasons  it  wouldn’t  apply  here.  First,  a  valid
defense on this basis requires a request to desist, unless
it would be dangerous or futile, before physical force is
used.  Under  these  facts  there’s  no  evidence  of  such  a
request.  Second,  the  privilege  would  only  entitle  the
customer to use reasonable force. Putting out a couple of
the  customer’s
teeth  would  exceed 
privilege,  and  constitute  a  battery  (if  the  act  were
intentional).

that 

If Pocket asserts a claim against Dudd based on assault, will
Pocket prevail?

(A)  No, because the guards never touched Pocket.
(B)  No, because Dudd gave Pocket ten minutes to leave.
(C)  Yes, if Dudd intended to cause Pocket severe emotional

distress.

(D)    Yes,  because  Dudd  threatened  Pocket  with  a  harmful  or

offensive bodily contact.

Answer 7: Choice (B) is correct. An assault is the intentional
causing of an apprehension of harmful or offensive contact. It
must  appear  to  the  plaintiff  that  the  harm  being  threatened  is
imminent.  Threats  of  future  harm  cannot  constitute  assaults,
and the courts have taken a relatively strict view requiring a
short  period  between  the  making  of  the  threat  and  the  time

663

when, according to the threat, the harm will take place. Rest.
2d  §  29,  Comment  c.  A  threatened  harm  ten  minutes  later
would be considered a future harm, and not an assault.

(A)   is wrong because an assault results in an apprehension of
contact.  It  is  not  necessary  that  the  plaintiff  actually  be
touched.

(C)      is  wrong  because  the  intent  to  cause  severe  emotional
distress  is  not  an  element  of  the  crime  of  assault.  The
question asks if the plaintiff would “prevail” in a claim
for assault, and plaintiff would have been able to prevail
(i.e.,  recover  some  damages)  for  impairment  of  his
interest  in  “dignity,”  even  without  any  showing  of
emotional  distress,  if  the  “imminence”  requirement
discussed in (B) had been satisfied.

(D) is wrong because, as discussed in the explanation of (B),
threats of future harm are not actionable.

III.  INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL

DISTRESS (“IIED”)

A.  “Extreme and outrageous”

Question  8:  Poe  ordered  some  merchandise  from  Store.
When the merchandise was delivered, Poe decided that it was
not what he had ordered, and he returned it for credit. Store
refused  to  credit  Poe’s  account,  continued  to  bill  him,  and,
after  90  days,  turned  the  account  over  to  Kane,  a  bill
collector, for collection.

Kane  called  at  Poe’s  house  at  7  p.m.  on  a  summer  evening
while many of Poe’s neighbors were seated on their porches.
When  Poe  opened  the  door,  Kane,  who  was  standing  just
outside the door, raised an electrically amplified bullhorn to
his mouth. In a voice that could be heard a block away, Kane
called Poe a “deadbeat” and asked him when he intended to
pay his bill to Store. Poe, greatly angered, slammed the door
shut. Poe’s neighbors teased him on and off for several weeks
about being a deadbeat, causing him severe embarrassment.

If  Poe  asserts  a  claim  based  on  intentional  infliction  of
emotional distress against Kane, will Poe prevail?

664

(A) 

  Yes,  because  Kane’s  conduct  was  extreme  and
outrageous.

(B)  Yes, because Kane was intruding on Poe’s property.
(C)  No, unless Poe suffered physical harm.
(D)  No, if Poe still owed Store for the merchandise.
Answer 8: Choice (A) is correct. An intentional infliction of
emotional  distress  claim  has  four  elements:  (1)  extreme  and
outrageous  conduct  of  defendant;  (2)  defendant’s  intent  to
cause plaintiff to suffer emotional distress; (3) causation; and
(4)  severe  distress  on  the  plaintiff’s  part.  Thus,  the  element
Choice  (A)  states — the  extreme  and  outrageous  conduct — 
is the lynchpin of an emotional distress claim. In fact, where
creditors  are  concerned,  a  pattern  of  abuse,  hounding  and
extreme conduct can form the basis for an emotional distress
claim,  even  if  the  plaintiff  really  owes  the  money!  The
conduct  here — especially 
to
embarrass  Poe  in  front  of  his  neighbors — rises  to  the  level
of the required outrageousness.

the  bullhorn 

the  use  of 

(B)   is wrong because, while Kane’s invading Poe’s property
might  contribute  to  the  outrageousness  of  his  conduct,
it’s not a necessary element. If Kane had gone up to Poe
in  a  restaurant  and  undertaken  the  same  behavior,  it
would  have  constituted  emotional  distress.  Where
creditors  are  concerned,  severe  abuse,  hounding  and
otherwise-outrageous conduct will form the basis for an
emotional distress claim (whereas garden-variety phone
calls, even rude ones, won’t).

(C)      is  wrong  because,  while  plaintiff  must  show  that  he
suffered severe emotional distress, the distress need not
be accompanied by, or lead to, physical injury or bodily
instance,  plaintiff’s  embarrassment  and
harm.  For 
humiliation, if severe enough, can constitute the requisite
severe distress.

(D)   is wrong because it’s not relevant to Poe’s claim. Even if
Poe  actually  did  owe  the  store  money,  this  would  not
preclude his recovery on an emotional distress claim. If
you chose this response, you may have been thinking of a
defamation claim, where truth is a defense. Thus, if Poe
actually owed money and Kane called him a “deadbeat”

665

in  the  hearing  of  others,  even  if  Poe  proved  special
damages  Kane  would  have  a  valid  defense 
to
defamation — Poe’s 
a  deadbeat.
However,  the  claim  here  is  for  emotional  distress,  and
truth is not a defense to that tort.

B.  Actual severe distress

Question 9:  Dumont,  a  real  estate  developer,  was  trying  to
purchase  land  on  which  he  intended  to  build  a  large
commercial  development.  Perkins,  an  elderly  widow,  had
rejected  all  of  Dumont’s  offers  to  buy  her  ancestral  home,
where she had lived all her life and which was located in the
middle  of  Dumont’s  planned  development.  Finally,  Dumont
offered her $250,000. He told her that it was his last offer and
that  if  she  rejected  it,  state  law  authorized  him  to  have  her
property condemned.

Perkins  then  consulted  her  nephew,  a  law  student,  who
researched  the  question  and  advised  her  that  Dumont  had  no
power  of  condemnation  under  state  law.  Perkins  had  been
badly frightened by Dumont’s threat, and was outraged when
she learned that Dumont had lied to her.
If  Perkins  sues  Dumont  for  damages  for  emotional  distress,
will she prevail?
(A)  Yes, if Dumont’s action was extreme and outrageous.
(B)  Yes, because Perkins was frightened and outraged.
(C)  No, if Perkins did not suffer emotional distress that was

severe.

(D)    No,  if  it  was  not  Dumont’s  purpose  to  cause  emotional

distress.

Answer 9: Choice (C) is correct. In order to prevail in a case
of  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  the  plaintiff
must  show  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  was  extreme  and
outrageous  and  that  she,  in  fact,  suffered  severe  emotional
distress. If Perkins did not suffer emotional distress that was
severe, she will not prevail.
(A)   is wrong because the plaintiff must not only show that the
defendant’s  conduct  was  extreme  and  outrageous,  but
also that she, in fact, suffered severe emotional distress.

666

The  facts  state  that  Perkins  was  badly  frightened  and
outraged;  however,  this  does  not  indicate  that  she
suffered severe emotional distress. Therefore, Perkins is
not  certain  to  prevail  merely  by  showing  “extreme  and
outrageous” conduct, as this choice suggests.

(B)      is  wrong  because,  as  discussed  in  the  explanation  of
Choice  (A),  the  fact  that  Perkins  was  frightened  and
outraged  does  not  indicate  that  she  suffered  severe
emotional distress, as required in a claim for intentional
infliction of emotional distress.

(D)      is  wrong  because  the  plaintiff  is  not  required  to  show
that  the  defendant’s  purpose  was  to  cause  emotional
distress. The plaintiff may recover if she can show that
the  defendant  either  intended  to  cause  severe  emotional
distress  or  acted  recklessly  with  respect  to  the  risk  of
plaintiff’s  emotional  distress 
in  deliberate
disregard  of  a  high  probability  that  the  distress  would
occur).

(i.e., 

Question 10:  Dayton  operates  a  collection  agency.  He  was
trying to collect a $400 bill for medical services rendered to
Pratt by Doctor.
Dayton  went  to  Pratt’s  house  and  when  Martina,  Pratt’s
mother, answered the door, Dayton told Martina he was there
to  collect  a  bill  owed  by  Pratt.  Martina  told  Dayton  that
because  of  her  illness,  Pratt  had  been  unemployed  for  six
months, that she was still ill and unable to work, and that she
would pay the bill as soon as she could.

Dayton, in a loud voice, demanded to see Pratt and said that if
he  did  not  receive  payment  immediately,  he  would  file  a
criminal complaint charging her with fraud. Pratt, hearing the
conversation,  came  to  the  door.  Dayton,  in  a  loud  voice,
repeated his demand for immediate payment and his threat to
use criminal process.
If Pratt asserts a claim against Dayton, based on infliction of
emotional distress, will Pratt prevail?
(A)  Yes, if Pratt suffered severe emotional distress as a result

of Dayton’s conduct.

(B)    Yes,  unless  the  bill  for  medical  services  was  valid  and

667

past due.

(C)    No,  unless  Pratt  suffered  physical  harm  as  a  result  of

Dayton’s conduct.

(D)  No, if Dayton’s conduct created no risk of physical harm

to Pratt.

Answer 10: The correct choice is (A). In order to prevail in a
case  of  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  the
plaintiff must show that the defendant’s conduct was extreme
and outrageous and that she, in fact, suffered severe emotional
distress. The conduct must be “. . . so outrageous in character,
and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds
of  decency,  and  to  be  regarded  as  atrocious,  and  utterly
intolerable  in  a  civilized  community.”  Rest.  2d  §  46,
Comment d. In determining whether the defendant’s conduct is
sufficiently  outrageous,  the  court  will  take  into  account  the
particular  characteristics  of  the  plaintiff  and  the  relationship
between  her  and  the  defendant.  Pratt  has  been  ill  for  six
months and unable to work, apparently in a physically frail or
mentally frail condition. As a bill collector, Dayton’s conduct,
repeatedly  screaming  at  Pratt  (even  when  she  came  to  the
door)  and  threatening  to  file  criminal  fraud  charges  against
her, while aware of her poor state of health, would rise to the
level  of  extreme  and  outrageous.  Therefore,  if  Pratt  suffered
severe emotional distress, she would prevail.

(B)      is  wrong  because  Pratt  would  not  prevail  unless  she
showed that she suffered severe emotional distress as a
result  of  Dayton’s  extreme  and  outrageous  behavior,  an
element  missing  from  this  choice.  In  any  case,  it  is
irrelevant whether or not the $400 bill was indeed valid
and past due, since Dayton’s conduct would be deemed
extreme and outrageous regardless of the validity of the
debt.

(C)      is  wrong  because  whether  or  not  the  plaintiff  suffers
physical  harm  is  not  determinative.  As  long  as  the
conduct  is  extreme  and  outrageous,  plaintiff  is  not
required to show that she suffered physical harm in order
to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
(D)   is wrong because whether or not the defendant’s conduct
created risk of physical harm is irrelevant in a case for

668

intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress.  In  order  to
prevail  in  a  case  of  intentional  infliction  of  emotional
distress,  the  plaintiff  must  show  that  the  defendant’s
conduct was extreme and outrageous and that she, in fact,
suffered severe emotional distress.

C.  Suits by public figures

Question  11:  Doe,  the  governor  of  State,  signed  a  death
warrant for Rend, a convicted murderer. Able and Baker are
active  opponents  of  the  death  penalty.  At  a  demonstration
protesting  the  execution  of  Rend,  Able  and  Baker  carried
large signs that stated, “Governor Doe, Murderer.” Television
station  XYZ  broadcast  news  coverage  of  the  demonstration,
including pictures of the signs carried by Able and Baker. If
Doe asserts against XYZ a claim for damages for intentional
infliction of emotional distress, will Doe prevail?

(A)    Yes,  if  the  broadcast  showing  the  signs  caused  Doe  to

suffer severe emotional distress.

(B)  Yes, because the assertion on the signs was extreme and

outrageous.

(C)  No, unless Doe suffered physical harm as a consequence

of the emotional distress caused by the signs.

(D)  No, because XYZ did not publish a false statement of fact

with “actual malice.”

Answer  11:  Choice  (D)  is  correct  in  its  emphasis  on  two
distinct, and important, points. First is the issue of defendant’s
mental  state.  In  the  case  of  a  defamation  suit,  the  media
defendant must have acted with knowledge of the statement’s
falsity  or  with  reckless  disregard  of  its  truth  (“actual
malice”).  New  York  Times  Co.  v.  Sulllivan  (1964).The
Supreme  Court  has  made  the  New  York  Times  standard  also
applicable  to  actions  against  public  figures  for  intentional
infliction  of  emotional  distress  (IIED):  The  defendant  must
have acted with “actual malice” (i.e., with intent or reckless
disregard)  with  respect  to  the  accuracy  of  the  statement.
Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988). Second, in an IIED case
involving  a  public  figure,  as  in  a  defamation  case,  the
defendant must have made a provably false statement of fact,
as opposed, for instance, to a statement of opinion. Here, any

669

reasonable  reader  of  the  sign  who  took  into  account  the
political  context  of  its  display  (death-penalty  protest)  would
have understood that Able and Baker were making statements
of  opinion,  not  provably-false  statements  of  fact.  Therefore,
XYZ  couldn’t  be  liable  for  either  defamation  or  IIED  for
repeating those non-factually-false statements.

(A)      is  wrong  because  the  plaintiff  must  show  a  provable
false statement made with actual malice (not merely that
plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress) as described
in (D).

(B)      is  wrong  because  the  plaintiff  must  show  a  provable
false statement made with actual malice (not merely that
defendant’s  conduct  was  extreme  and  outrageous)  as
described in (D).

(C)      is  wrong  because  whether  or  not  the  plaintiff  suffers
physical harm is not determinative. Most modern courts
do not require physical harm — merely severe emotional
distress — for  claims  of 
infliction  of
emotional distress. In any event, plaintiff won’t recover
for the reasons described in (D).

CHAPTER 2
INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH
PROPERTY

I.    TRESPASS TO LAND

A.  Intent

1.  Involuntary entry onto land of another

Question 12: A car driven by Dan entered land owned by and
in the possession of Peter, without Peter’s permission.

Which, if any, of the following allegations, without additional
facts,  would  provide  a  sufficient  basis  for  a  claim  by  Peter
against Dan?
                    I. Dan intentionally drove his car onto Peter’s

land.

                    II. Dan negligently drove his car onto Peter’s land
                    III. Dan’s car damaged Peter’s land.
(A)  I only.
(B)  III only.
(C)  I, II, or III.
(D)  Neither I, nor II, nor III.
Answer 12: Choice (A) is correct, because it recognizes that
only  Choice  I  contains  an  allegation  which  by  itself  would
provide the plaintiff with a sufficient basis for relief.

I. A trespass to land can occur when the defendant enters the
plaintiff’s land, or causes another person or an object to enter
the plaintiff’s land. If a defendant intentionally drives his car
onto  plaintiff’s  land,  he  has  committed  a  trespass,  and  the
plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages regardless of whether
any  harm  has  occurred.  Rest.  2d  §163.  This  answer  choice
contains an allegation that would provide the plaintiff with a
sufficient basis for relief.
II.  If  the  plaintiff  relies  on  a  negligence  theory  in  a  trespass
case,  he  must  prove  not  only  that  the  defendant  was  in  fact
negligent,  but  also  that  he  (the  plaintiff)  suffered  actual

671

damages.  Rest.  2d  §165.  The  facts  do  not  indicate  that  the
plaintiff suffered any harm; therefore, this answer choice does
not contain an allegation that would provide the plaintiff with
a sufficient basis for relief.

III. To be liable for trespass, entry on another’s land must be
intentional,  negligent,  or  pursuant  to  the  carrying  out  of  an
“abnormally dangerous activity.” Rest. 2d §166. Although the
facts  do  indicate  that  Dan’s  car  damaged  Peter’s  land,  he
would  not  be  liable  for  trespass  unless  one  of  those  three
conditions  applied.  Therefore,  the  allegation  by  itself  would
not provide the plaintiff with a sufficient basis for relief.

(B)    ,  (C),  and  (D)  are  all  wrong,  because  each  is  somehow

inconsistent with the above analysis.

2.  Effect of mistake

Question  13:  David  built  in  his  backyard  a  garage  that
encroached  two  feet  across  the  property  line  onto  property
owned by his neighbor, Prudence. Thereafter, David sold his
property  to  Drake.  Prudence  was  unaware,  prior  to  David’s
sale  to  Drake,  of  the  encroachment  of  the  garage  onto  her
property.  When  she  thereafter  learned  of  the  encroachment,
she sued David for damages for trespass.
In this action, will Prudence prevail?

(A)  No, unless David was aware of the encroachment when

the garage was built.

(B)    No,  because  David  no  longer  owns  or  possesses  the

garage.

(C)  Yes, because David knew where the garage was located,
whether or not he knew where the property line was.
(D)  Yes, unless Drake was aware of the encroachment when

he purchased the property.

Answer  13:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  A  trespass  to  land  can
occur when the defendant enters the plaintiff’s land, or causes
another  person  or  an  object  to  enter  the  plaintiff’s  land.  A
“continuing  trespass”  is  one  where  the  object  stays  on  the
land.  If  a  defendant  intentionally  enters  onto  the  plaintiff’s
land, the plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages regardless of
whether any harm has occurred. David built the garage, so his

672

intentional actions caused an object to enter onto Prudence’s
land  and  constituted  a  continuing  trespass.  The  fact  that  he
may not have known where the property line was and so was
unaware of the encroachment is irrelevant.

(A)   is wrong because it implies that there is no liability for
trespass  if  a  defendant  enters  onto  the  land  and  is
unaware  that  he  is  trespassing.  If  the  defendant  enters
onto  the  plaintiff’s  land  thinking  that  it  is  his  own,  or
thinking erroneously that he is entitled to be there, he has
still committed an intentional trespass.

(B)   is wrong because David committed the tort and is liable
for  it  regardless  of  whether  or  not  he  has  current
ownership of the trespassing object.

(D)      is  wrong  because  David  committed  an  act  that
constituted  trespass  and  he  is  liable  for  it.  That’s  true
even  if  the  new  owner  knew  of  the  encroachment — 
once  David  built  the  encroaching  structure  he  had
committed  trespass  (which  was  an  ongoing  tort  as  long
as he owned the structure), and nothing that happened at
or  after  the  time  of  sale  by  David  could  retroactively
change this fact.

II.   CONVERSION

A.  Forced sale

Question  14:  Dower,  an  inexperienced  driver,  borrowed  a
car  from  Puder,  a  casual  acquaintance,  for  the  express
purpose  of  driving  it  several  blocks  to  the  local  drug  store.
Instead, Dower drove the car, which then was worth $12,000,
100 miles to Other City. While Dower was driving in Other
City the next day, the car was hit by a negligently driven truck
and  sustained  damage  that  will  cost  $3,000  to  repair.  If
repaired, the car will be fully restored to its former condition.
If Puder asserts a claim against Dower based on conversion,
Puder should recover a judgment for

(A)  $12,000.
(B)  $3,000.
(C)    $3,000  plus  damages  for  the  loss  of  the  use  of  the  car

673

during its repair.

(D)  nothing, unless Dower was negligent and his negligence

was a substantial cause of the collision.

Answer 14: Choice (A) is correct. Conversion occurs when
the  defendant  so  substantially  interferes  with  the  plaintiff’s
possession or ownership of property that it is fair to require
the defendant to pay the property’s full value. Rest 2d § 222A.
One must consider the extent and duration of the defendant’s
exercise of control over the object, the defendant’s good faith,
the  harm  done  to  the  property,  and  the  inconvenience  and
expense caused to the plaintiff. The defendant had permission
to  drive  the  plaintiff’s  car  several  blocks  and  instead  drove
100 miles to Other City and continued to drive it in Other City
the following day. There does not appear to be any good faith
exhibited  by  the  defendant.  The  car  sustained  $3,000  in
damages (1/4 of its total value). Considering these facts, it is
fair to require that the defendant pay the full value of the car
as damages for conversion.

(B)      and  (C)  are  wrong  because  they  incorrectly  assert  that
plaintiff’s recovery would provide only for repair of the
car and loss of use of the car (as in a claim of trespass to
chattels).  The  suit  here  is  for  conversion,  and  in
conversion  plaintiff  recovers  the  full  value  of  the  item
(viewed as of the moment before the taking).

(D)   is wrong because in a claim of conversion, the issue of
who  was  at  fault  in  damaging  the  plaintiff’s  property
(once the defendant committed a substantial interference
with it) is irrelevant. In other words, if the car was the
subject of conversion, then the defendant is responsible
to  pay  for  its  full  value  regardless  of  whether  it  was
physically damaged (or by whom).

674

CHAPTER 3
DEFENSES TO INTENTIONAL TORTS

I.    SELF-DEFENSE

A.  Degree of force

Question 15: In a plaintiff’s action for battery, the evidence
established  that  the  plaintiff  was  bad-tempered  and,  the
defendant  knew,  carried  a  gun  and  used  it  often;  that  the
plaintiff struck the defendant first; that during the altercation,
the  plaintiff  repeatedly  tried  to  get  to  his  gun;  and  that  the
blows inflicted upon the plaintiff by the defendant resulted in
the plaintiff being hospitalized.

Which  finding  of  fact  would  be  most  likely  to  result  in  a
verdict for the defendant?
(A)    The  defendant  used  no  more  force  than  he  actually
believed was necessary to protect himself against death
or serious bodily harm.

(B)    The  defendant  used  no  more  force  than  he  reasonably
believed was necessary to protect himself against death
or serious bodily harm.

(C)    The  defendant,  in  fact,  feared  death  or  serious  bodily

harm.

(D)    The  defendant  was  justified  in  retaliating  against  the
plaintiff because the plaintiff struck the first blow.
Answer  15:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  The  facts  show  that  the
plaintiff hit the defendant and the defendant hit him back. So
the  defendant  committed  a  battery,  but  he  may  be  privileged
because  he  was  acting  in  self-defense.  The  question  is
whether the force used by the defendant was justified. Choice
(B) states the test correctly: The defendant is not liable if he
“used  no  more  force  than  he  reasonably  believed  was
necessary  to  protect  himself  against  death  or  serious  bodily
harm.”  The  most  important  point  about  this  answer  is  the
word “reasonably.” Claims of self-defense are not judged by
asking whether the defendant thought he was using necessary
force. The test is whether the amount of force was reasonable

675

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

under the circumstances. Only then does the defendant get the
benefit  of  the  self-defense  privilege.  See  Rest.  2d  §63  and
Comment i.

(A)  is  wrong  because  it  focuses  on  whether  the  defendant
“actually” believed that the force he used was necessary. As
explained in the discussion of Choice (B) above, the legal test
is not whether the defendant acted in good faith, or according
to  “actual”  beliefs.  The  legal  test  is  whether  he  acted
reasonably — and  reasonableness  is  judged  by  the  trier  of
fact,  not  by  the  defendant.  If  the  defendant  did  not  act
reasonably, he loses the privilege no matter how strongly he
believed  that  the  force  he  used  was  necessary.  See  Rest.  2d
§63 and Comment i.

(C) is wrong because, like answer Choice (A), it focuses on
what  was  going  through  the  defendant’s  mind — on  whether
he  “in  fact”  feared  death  or  serious  bodily  harm.  But  an
authentic  fear  of  death  is  not  enough  to  support  the  self-
defense  privilege.  The  force  used  by  the  defendant  must  be
reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  The  reasonableness  of
the force used by the defendant is an objective judgment made
by the trier of fact. See Rest. 2d §63 and Comment i.
(D)  is  wrong  because  being  hit  first  does  not  necessarily
entitle  the  defendant  to  respond  with  force.  First,  note  the
suggestion in this choice that the defendant was “retaliating.”
The  privilege  of  self-defense  does  not  create  a  right  to
“retaliate”  or  “get  even.”  It  is  strictly  a  privilege  to  protect
oneself against present or future attack. In this case the facts
obviously  do  suggest  that  the  defendant  faced  an  ongoing
threat.  But  in  that  case  the  outcome  depends  on  the
reasonableness of the defendant’s use of force in reply to that
threat — it  does  not  depend  on  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  hit
him first. See Rest. 2d §63 and Comment g.

B.  Injury to third person

Question 16: In the course of a bank holdup, Robber fired a
gun at Guard. Guard drew his revolver and returned the fire.
One  of  the  bullets  fired  by  Guard  ricocheted,  striking
Plaintiff.
If Plaintiff asserts a claim against Guard based upon battery,

676

will Plaintiff prevail?

(A)  Yes, unless Plaintiff was Robber’s accomplice.
(B)  Yes, under the doctrine of transferred intent.
(C)  No, if Guard fired reasonably in his own defense.
(D)  No, if Guard did not intend to shoot Plaintiff.
Answer 16:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  In  a  situation  where  the
defendant  is  entitled  to  use  reasonable  force  in  his  self-
defense,  and  does  so,  the  fact  that  he  injures  an  innocent
bystander  does  not  prevent  the  use  of  force  from  being
privileged (as long as the defendant did not act negligently in
choosing  to  shoot,  and  in  how  he  shot).  That’s  what  this
choice says.

(A)      is  wrong  because  Plaintiff  will  not  prevail  if  the
defendant’s  actions  were  privileged,  which  they  would
be if the defense of self-defense applied. And that’s true
regardless  of  whether  Plaintiff  was  Robber’s
accomplice  or  was  instead  an  innocent  bystander  (as
discussed in the explanation of (C)).

(B)      is  wrong  because  Guard’s  actions  may  have  been
privileged,  and  if  so,  he  will  not  be  liable  for  battery
despite application of the transferred intent doctrine. The
doctrine of transferred intent provides that as long as the
defendant  held  the  necessary  intent  with  respect  to  one
person, he will be held to have committed an intentional
tort  against  any  other  person  who  he  happens  to  injure.
Ordinarily  this  would  mean  that  if  Guard  had  the
requisite  intent  to  commit  battery  against  Robber  he
would also be deemed to have had the requisite intent to
commit  battery  against  Plaintiff  who  was  injured  by
accident. However, if Guard was acting in self-defense,
his  actions  were  privileged,  in  which  case  Plaintiff
would  not  prevail,  as  discussed  in  the  explanation  of
Choice (C).

(D)      is  wrong  because  it  cites  a  fact  that  will  not  be
dispositive. According to the transferred intent doctrine,
as  explained  in  the  discussion  of  (B),  Guard  could  be
held liable for battery of Plaintiff even if he didn’t intend
to shoot Plaintiff, as long as he had the requisite intent to

677

shoot  Robber.  (Instead,  the  outcome  will  depend  on
whether Guard qualifies for the defense of self-defense.)

II.   DEFENSE OF OTHERS

A.  General rule

1.  Unreasonable mistake

Question 17: Karen was crossing Main Street at a crosswalk.
John,  who  was  on  the  sidewalk  nearby,  saw  a  speeding
automobile  heading  in  Karen’s  direction.  John  ran  into  the
street and pushed Karen out of the path of the car. Karen fell
to the ground and broke her leg.

In  an  action  for  battery  brought  by  Karen  against  John,  will
Karen prevail?

(A)  Yes, because John could have shouted a warning instead

of pushing Karen out of the way.

(B)  Yes, if Karen was not actually in danger and John should

have realized it.

(C)    No,  because  the  driver  of  the  car  was  responsible  for

Karen’s injury.

(D)  No, if John’s intent was to save Karen, not to harm her.
is  correct.  Since  John  has
Answer  17:  Choice  (B) 
intentionally  caused  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact  with
another,  he’s  liable  for  battery  unless  he  has  a  defense.  The
only  defense  that  plausibly  applies  here  is  “defense  of
others.”  That  is,  just  as  a  person  has  the  right  to  use  self-
defense  to  save  himself  from  harm,  he  has  that  right  with
respect to another person who is threatened with harm (even a
stranger,  under  the  modern  view).  However,  the  defense-of-
others  defense,  like  the  right  of  self-defense,  requires  that
both  the  actor’s  belief  that  danger  exists,  and  his  belief  that
the proposed conduct is a good way to deal with the danger,
be  reasonable.  If  John  should  have  realized  that  Karen  was
not  in  fact  in  danger,  this  requirement  for  the  defense-of-
others defense would not be satisfied.
(A)   is wrong because the fact that an alternative method of
dealing  with  the  danger  might  have  solved  the  problem

678

does  not  automatically  mean  that  John’s  method  was
unreasonable. As described in the analysis of Choice (B)
above,  John  was  entitled  to  the  defense  of  defense-of-
others unless either his choice of methods, or his belief
in  Karen’s  peril,  was  unreasonable.  The  mere  fact  that
the alternative method of shouting a warning might have
solved  the  problem  doesn’t  mean  that  John’s  approach
was  unreasonable.  (For  one  thing,  pushing  Karen  to  the
ground  merely  threatened  minor  injury,  whereas  if  she
were  hit  she  might  well  be  killed  or  seriously  injured.
For  another,  John  could  reasonably  have  believed  that
Karen  wouldn’t  hear  his  shout,  that  she  wouldn’t  know
that  she  was  the  one  being  shouted  at,  or  that  there
wasn’t time for her to react if she did hear.)

(C)      is  wrong  because  John  might  be  jointly-and-severally
liable  with  the  driver.  The  speeding  driver  would
clearly  be  a  cause  of  the  injury,  and  would  therefore
likely  be  jointly-and-severally  liable  with  John  if  John
was  liable.  But  this  fact  wouldn’t  save  John  from
liability, if John’s choice of methods (or his belief in the
danger)  was  unreasonable.  Always  remember  that  a
given injury can have multiple causes, and can thus lead
to  multiple  tortfeasors  (even  if  they  did  not  act  in
concert) being held jointly liable.

(D)   is wrong because John’s intent to save Karen wouldn’t
the  danger  was
if  his  belief 
immunize  him 
unreasonable. As is discussed in the analysis of Choice
(B),  John  only  qualifies  for  the  defense  of  defense-of-
others if his belief in the existence of the danger, and his
choice of methods, were reasonable.

A.  Private necessity

1.  Actual damage

Question 18: Husband and Wife, walking on a country road,
were  frightened  by  a  bull  running  loose  on  the  road.  They
climbed over a fence to get onto the adjacent property, owned
by Grower. After climbing over the fence, Husband and Wife

679

damaged some of Grower’s plants which were near the fence.
The fence was posted with a large sign, “No Trespassing.”

Grower  saw  Husband  and  Wife  and  came  toward  them  with
his large watchdog on a long leash. The dog rushed at Wife.
Grower had intended only to frighten Husband and Wife, but
the leash broke, and before Grower could restrain the dog, the
dog bit Wife.

If  Grower  asserts  a  claim  against  Wife  and  Husband  for
damage to his plants, will Grower prevail?

(A)    Yes,  because  Wife  and  Husband  entered  on  his  land

without permission.

(B)  Yes, because Grower had posted his property with a “No

Trespassing” sign.

(C)    No,  because  Wife  and  Husband  were  confronted  by  an

emergency situation.

(D)    No,  because  Grower  used  excessive  force  toward  Wife

and Husband.

Answer  18:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  This  choice  correctly
identifies  the  basis  on  which  Husband  and  Wife  will  be
liable:  Although  their  entry  was  privileged,  it  was  not
authorized,  so  they’ll  be  liable  for  any  damage  they  cause.
The  charging  bull  created  the  necessity  that  created  the
privilege to enter Grower’s land. However, private necessity
is a qualified privilege, requiring that the entrant pay for any
damage  caused.  While  (A)  does  not  explicitly  mention
necessity,  it  does  identify  the  essential  reason  Husband  and
Wife will be liable, so it’s the best response.

(B)      is  wrong  because  it’s  not  relevant.  Without  a  “No
Trespassing”  sign,  Wife  and  Husband  would  still  be
liable  as  trespassers  if  their  entry  wasn’t  authorized  or
justified;  and  with  it,  they  wouldn’t  be  liable  if  their
entry  was  authorized  or  justified.  In  fact,  under  these
facts  Husband  and  Wife  were  privileged  to  enter
Grower’s property due to necessity: They were escaping
from a bull. The reason they’ll be liable for the damage
to  the  plants  is  because  necessity  is  only  a  qualified
privilege,  meaning 
caused  must  be
compensated. The existence of a “No Trespassing” sign

loss 

any 

680

is thus irrelevant to Husband and Wife’s liability.
(C)   is wrong because, although it correctly characterizes the
facts,  it  ignores  the  fact  that  Husband  and  Wife  will  be
liable  for  the  damage  to  the  plants.  Husband  and  Wife
entered  Grower’s  land  under  a  privilege  of  private
necessity: They were being chased by a bull. However,
the  defense  of  private  necessity  is  a  qualified  one,
requiring  that  any  loss  caused  be  compensated.  If  you
chose this response, it could be that you confused private
necessity with public necessity, which involves a threat
to  the  public  necessitating  entry  (e.g.,  burning  down  a
house to stop the spread of a fire). Most courts hold that
public  necessity  is  an  absolute  defense,  such  that  the
entrant will not be liable for damage caused. However,
that’s not the case here — the threat is only to Husband
and Wife. As a result, they’ll be liable for the damaged
plants.

(D)      is  wrong  because  it  cites  an  irrelevant  fact.  Even  if
Husband  and  Wife  have  a  viable  assault  claim  against
Grower  (which  is  doubtful — he  was  probably  using
reasonable measures to protect his property, and was not
negligent in failing to foresee that the leash might break),
the  assault  claim  wouldn’t  be  a  defense  against
Grower’s  claim  for  the  damage  to  the  plants.  The
damage  to  the  plants  had  already  occurred  by  the  time
the dog rushed at Wife, so the couple’s liability for that
damage  must  rise  or  fall  without  reference  to  the  dog’s
later actions or Grower’s role in enabling those actions.

CHAPTER 4
NEGLIGENCE GENERALLY

I.    THE REASONABLE PERSON

A.  Physical and mental characteristics

1.  Children

Question  19:  Dora,  who  was  eight  years  old,  went  to  the
grocery  store  with  her  mother.  Dora  pushed  the  grocery  cart
while  her  mother  put  items  into  it.  Dora’s  mother  remained
near Dora at all times. Peterson, another customer in the store,
noticed  Dora  pushing  the  cart  in  a  manner  that  caused
Peterson  no  concern.  A  short  time  later,  the  cart  Dora  was
pushing struck Peterson in the knee, inflicting serious injury.

If  Peterson  brings  an  action,  based  on  negligence,  against
Dora, Dora’s best argument in defense would be that
(A)    Dora  exercised  care  commensurate  with  her  age,

intelligence, and experience.
(B)  Dora is not subject to tort liability.
(C)  Dora was subject to parental supervision.
(D)    Peterson  assumed  the  risk  that  Dora  might  hit  Peterson

with the cart.

Answer 19: Choice (A)  is  correct.  Children  are  not  held  to
the level of care which would be exercised by a reasonable
adult.  A  child  must  merely  conform  to  the  conduct  of  a
“reasonably careful person of the same age, intelligence, and
experience.” Rest. 3d (Liab. For Phys. Harm), § 10(a).
(B)  is  wrong  because  children  are  subject  to  liability  for
intentional  torts  and  also  for  negligence.  Dora  is  eight  years
old — capable of negligence, and subject to liability using the
“reasonable person” standard discussed in (A). Traditionally,
children  under  seven  have  been  deemed  incapable  of
negligence;  under  modern  cases,  only  children  under  the  age
of five are usually deemed incapable of negligence. Rest. 3d
(Liab. For Phys. Harm, § 10(b)). Children are also subject to
liability for intentional torts if it can be proven that they had

682

the requisite intent. So there is no principle by which an eight-
year-old  would  get  immunity  from  tort  law,  as  this  choice
asserts.

(C) is wrong because a parent’s duty to supervise her child is
separate from the duty of the child to not cause intentional or
negligent  harm  to  others.  The  fact  that  Dora  was  supervised
(or  should  have  been  supervised)  would  not  relieve  her  of
tort liability for her actions.

(D) is wrong because the assumption-of-risk doctrine would
not apply in this context. Assumption of risk applies when a
plaintiff  has  voluntarily  consented  to  take  his  chances  that
harm  will  occur.  A  grocery  store  is  not  a  dangerous  place
where one expects to get struck in the knee and suffer serious
injury.  Nor  was  Peterson  alerted  to  a  possible  danger,
because Dora was not pushing the cart in a manner that caused
her concern.

B.  Anticipating conduct of others

1.  Negligence

a.  Parental supervision

i.  Direct liability

Question 20: An eight-year-old girl went to the grocery store
with  her  mother.  The  girl  pushed  the  grocery  cart  while  her
mother put items into it. The girl’s mother remained near the
girl  at  all  times.  The  plaintiff,  another  customer  in  the  store,
noticed  the  girl  pushing  the  cart  in  a  manner  that  caused  the
plaintiff  no  concern.  A  short  time  later,  the  cart  the  girl  was
pushing  struck  the  plaintiff  in  the  knee,  inflicting  serious
injury.
If the plaintiff brings an action, based on negligence, against
the girl’s mother, will the plaintiff prevail?
(A)  Yes, if the girl was negligent.
(B)  Yes, because the girl’s mother is responsible for any harm

caused by the girl.

(C)    Yes,  because  the  girl’s  mother  assumed  the  risk  of  her

child’s actions.

(D)  Yes, if the girl’s mother did not adequately supervise the

683

girl’s actions.

Answer 20: Choice (D) is correct. The issue is whether and
when  a  parent  has  a  duty  to  supervise  a  child.  The
Restatement  says:  “A  parent  is  under  a  duty  to  exercise
reasonable care so as to control his minor child as to prevent
it  from  intentionally  harming  others  or  from  so  conducting
itself as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them,
if the parent (a) knows or has reason to know that he has the
ability to control his child, and (b) knows or should know of
the  necessity  and  opportunity  for  exercising  such  control.”
Rest. 2d § 316. Since the girl’s mother was with her when she
was  pushing  the  cart  in  the  supermarket  the  mother  had  the
duty 
they  caused  an
unreasonable risk of harm to others.

the  girl’s  actions 

to  control 

if 

(A)   is wrong because the parent’s duty is independent and is
not affected by the fact that the child is or is not subject
to liability for her own actions. Rest. 2d § 316, Comment
c.  So  even  if  the  child  was  negligent,  the  mother
wouldn’t  be  liable  (e.g.,  vicariously  liable)  as  long  as
the mother didn’t fail to make reasonable supervision of
the child.

(B)   is wrong because it is too broad a statement. There is a
duty  to  exercise  reasonable  care  to  prevent  intentional
harm or an unreasonable risk of harm if and only if “the
parent  (a)  knows  or  has  reason  to  know  that  he  has  the
ability  to  control  his  child,  and  (b)  knows  or  should
know  of  the  necessity  and  opportunity  for  exercising
such  control.”  Rest.  2d  §  316.  And  a  parent  has  no
vicarious  liable  for  her  child’s  torts,  whether  that  tort
consists of negligence or an intentional tort.

(C)      is  wrong  because  it  misapplies  the  assumption-of-risk
concept. Assumption of risk applies when a plaintiff has
voluntarily consented to take her chances that harm will
occur  and  is  therefore  barred  from  recovery  under
traditional  common  law  principles.  Here,  whether  the
mother was or wasn’t tolerating a risk to a third person,
the  assumption-of-risk  concept  wouldn’t  apply  to  the
mother’s liability to the third person.

2.  Criminal or intentionally tortious acts

684

Question  21:  A  light  company  is  the  sole  distributor  of
electrical power in a city. The company owns and maintains
all  of  the  electric  poles  and  equipment  in  the  city.  The  light
company  has  complied  with  the  National  Electrical  Safety
Code,  which  establishes  minimum  requirements  for  the
installation  and  maintenance  of  power  poles.  The  Code  has
been approved by the federal and state governments.

The light company has had to replace insulators on its poles
repeatedly because unknown persons repeatedly shoot at and
destroy  them.  This  causes  the  power  lines  to  fall  to  the
ground.  On  one  of  these  occasions,  a  5-year-old  boy
wandered  out  of  his  parents’  yard,  intentionally  touched  a
downed wire, and was seriously burned.

If  a  claim  on  the  boy’s  behalf  is  asserted  against  the  light
company, the probable result is that the boy will

(A)  recover, if the light company could have taken reasonable
steps to prevent the lines from falling when the insulators
were destroyed.

(B)  recover, because a supplier of electricity is strictly liable

in tort.

(C)    not  recover,  unless  the  light  company  failed  to  exercise

reasonable care to stop the destruction of the insulators.

(D)  not recover, because the destruction of the insulators was

intentional.

Answer  21:  The  correct  choice  is  (A).  First,  although  the
question doesn’t mention it, Choice A suggests that the claim
is  for  negligence.  It  couldn’t  be  an  intentional  tort  since
there’s  clearly  no  intent;  however,  what  is  trickier  is  to
eliminate  the  possibility  of  strict  liability,  since  transmitting
electricity over ordinary electric lines might (though probably
wouldn’t  (see  the  discussion  of  Choice  (B)  below)  be
considered  ultrahazardous.  However,  even  in  the  unlikely
case  that  the  electric  transmission  here  did  qualify  for  strict
liability,  the  required  proximate  cause  element  for  strict
liability would be missing, since the result — people shooting
out  insulators,  causing  the  line  to  fall  to  the  ground  and
causing injury there — would be sufficiently outside the risk
inherent  in  electricity  transmission  to  prevent  strict  liability

685

from applying.

Once  you’ve  concluded  that  the  claim  is  one  for  negligence,
you need to see what the boy would have to prove in order to
succeed. He’d have to show that (1) the light company failed
to  exercise  such  care  as  a  reasonable  person  in  its  position
would  have  exercised,  (2)  this  was  a  breach  of  the  duty  to
prevent  the  foreseeable  risk  of  injury  to  anyone  in  the  boy’s
position;  and  (3)  this  breach  proximately  caused  the  boy’s
damages.  As  to  (2),  where  danger  from  the  negligence  or
intentional  wrongdoing  of  third  persons  is  reasonably
foreseeable  to  the  defendant,  the  defendant’s  failure  to  take
reasonable  steps  to  prevent  the  wrongdoing,  or  the  danger
from  the  wrongdoing,  will  constitute  a  breach  of  the  duty  of
care.

Element  (3),  causation,  is  also  a  serious  issue  in  this  case.
That  is,  if  the  boy  is  to  prevail,  he  must  show  what
specifically the light company failed to do that it reasonably
could have done, and that if done would likely have prevented
the  harm.  This  choice  asserts  liability  “if  the  light  company
could  have  taken  reasonable  steps  to  prevent  the  lines  from
falling  when  the  insulators  were  destroyed.”  That’s  a
conditional  but  true  statement — we  don’t  know  whether  the
company could in fact have taken reasonable (practical) steps
to prevent the lines from falling when the insulators were shot
out, but if such steps were practical, the company would have
breached  its  ordinary  duty  of  due  care,  proximately  causing
the boy’s harm. This choice also doesn’t assert that failure to
take  such  steps  to  prevent  falling  lines  was  the  only  way  to
prevent  the  harm.  Therefore,  the  fact  that  the  company  might
have  had  other  possible  methods  to  avoid  the  harm  (e.g.,
reinforcing  the  insulators  or  other  parts  of  the  lines  so  that
shooting  the  insulators  wouldn’t  cause  the  lines  to  fall)
doesn’t  prevent  this  choice  from  correctly  specifying  one
practical  way  of  handling  the  problem  the  absence  of  which
proximately caused the harm.
(B)  is  wrong,  because  for  the  company  to  be  strictly  liable,
that liability would have to be premised upon either product
liability  or  liability  for  conducting  an  abnormally  dangerous
activity,  and  neither  applies  here.  Strict  product  liability

686

applies only when a person “sells or otherwise distributes” a
defective  “product.”  Those  who  sell  “services”  as
distinguished from “products” are not subject to strict product
liability. Rest. 3d (Prod. Liab.), §19. While some courts have
held  that  electricity  becomes  a  “product”  when  it  passes
through the customer’s own electric meter, virtually none have
held that electricity constitutes a product rather than a service
when it is part of the high voltage transmission system on its
way to the customer. Id., §19, Comm. d. So when the accident
happened here, the light company was supplying a service not
a product, and has no strict product liability. With respect to
strict  liability  for  carrying  on  an  abnormally  dangerous
activity,  the  provision  of  electricity,  even  through  high-
powered  transmission  lines,  is  generally  not  considered
abnormally dangerous, because it can (and usually is) carried
on  with  considerable  safety  if  customary  precautions  are
taken. (Furthermore, even in the unlikely case that the electric
transmission  here  did  qualify  for  the  abnormally-dangerous
form of strict liability, the required scope-of-risk element for
strict  liability  would  be  missing,  as  described  in  the  last
sentence of the first paragraph of the discussion of Choice (A)
above.)

So  the  light  company  will  not  be  strictly  liable  on  either
theory.
(C) is wrong, because the word “unless” causes the choice to
ignore an additional potential source of liability for the light
company.  It’s  true  that  the  light  company’s  failure  to  take
reasonable  steps  to  stop  the  destruction  of  the  insulators
would  make  it  liable  in  negligence.  But  even  if  the  light
company  had  taken  all  reasonable  steps  to  stop  this
destruction,  if  those  steps  had  been  unsuccessful  and  the
company  failed  to  also  take  a  second  available  approach  to
the  problem — by  failing  to  use  reasonable  care  to  prevent
the  lines  from  falling  when  the  insulators  were  destroyed,
assuming  those  steps  would  likely  have  succeeded — this
failure  would  be  a  separate, 
legally-sufficient  act  of
negligence,  making  this  choice  wrong  in  stating  that  the
company  could  only  be  liable  if  it  failed  to  stop  the
destruction itself.

687

(D)  is  wrong  because  a  person  who  maintains  property  in  a
condition dangerous to the public can be liable for negligently
failing  to  secure  the  property  even  against  intentional
wrongdoing (not just negligence) by a third party.

a.  Premises liability

Question  22:  The  plaintiff  and  a  salesman,  who  were
strangers  to  each  other,  were  passengers  sitting  in  adjoining
seats on an airline flight. There were many empty seats on the
aircraft.

During  the  flight,  a  flight  attendant  served  the  salesman  nine
drinks.  As  the  salesman  became  more  and  more  obviously
intoxicated  and  attempted  to  engage  the  plaintiff  in  a
conversation, the plaintiff chose to ignore the salesman. This
angered the salesman, who suddenly struck the plaintiff in the
face, giving her a black eye. If the plaintiff asserts a claim for
damages against the airline based on negligence, the plaintiff
will

(A)  not recover, because a person is not required by law to
come to the assistance of another who is imperiled by a
third party.

(B)    not  recover,  if  the  plaintiff  could  easily  have  moved  to

another seat.

(C)    recover,  because  a  common  carrier  is  strictly  liable  for
injuries  suffered  by  a  passenger  while  aboard  the
carrier.

(D)  recover, if the flight attendants should have perceived the
salesman’s  condition  and  acted  to  protect  the  plaintiff
before the blow was struck.

Answer  22:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  A  business  operator
whose  premises  are  open  to  third  persons  owes  a  duty  of
reasonable care to those on the premises to make reasonable
efforts to control the behavior of others on the premises, so as
to  prevent  them  from  causing  bodily  harm.  Therefore,  if  the
flight  attendants  should  have  perceived  that  the  salesman
posed an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to the plaintiff, and
should  have  realized  that  they  could  or  might  be  able  to
protect the plaintiff, the airline (the business operator) will be
liable for negligence because its employees did not intervene.

688

The  defendant’s  employees  (the  flight  attendants)  seem  to
have had the power to intervene — even if only by cutting off
the  drinks,  or  moving  either  the  plaintiff  or  the  salesmen.
Therefore,  under  the  doctrine  of  respondeat  superior,  the
airline  would  be  vicariously  liable  for  this  failure  to
intervene if the attendants should have recognized the danger
and acted to avoid it.

(A)  is  wrong  because,  while  this  choice  correctly  states  the
general  rule,  there  is  an  exception  where  some  special
relationship  exists  between  the  defendant  and  the  plaintiff,
such as where the defendant operates business premises open
to  the  public  on  which  the  plaintiff  is  present  at  the
defendant’s  invitation  (in  which  case  the  defendant  owes  a
duty of care to make reasonable efforts to prevent harm to the
plaintiff).  This  “business  premises”  exception  applies  here,
as discussed in the explanation of Choice D.

(B)   is wrong, because whether or not the plaintiff could have
easily changed her seat does not change the fact that the
flight  attendants  had  a  duty  to  act  reasonably  to  protect
her  from  foreseeable  harm.  The  plaintiff’s  failure  to
change  seats  would  have  been  at  most  comparative
negligence,  which  would  have 
reduced  but  not
eliminated  the  plaintiff’s  recovery  (so  that  plaintiff
would still have “recovered,” though not the full amount
of her damages).

(C)   is wrong because breach of the duty of reasonable care
may  result  in  negligence  liability  of  a  common  carrier,
but a common carrier is not strictly liable for injuries to
its passengers, as this choice asserts.

C.  MBE tip

Question 23:  A  plaintiff  always  brought  her  lunch  to  eat  in
the office. One Saturday afternoon the plaintiff went to a local
self-service grocery, and bought a can of corned beef. The can
had  printed  on  its  label  ‘‘A  Product  of  Beef  Company.’’  The
company  was  a  reputable  supplier  of  beef  products.  On
Sunday  evening,  the  woman  prepared  a  sandwich  for  lunch
the next day, using the can of corned beef she had bought on
Saturday.  When  the  plaintiff  bit  into  her  sandwich  at  lunch
time  the  next  day,  a  large  sliver  of  bone  concealed  in  the

689

corned  beef  slice  pierced  between  her  teeth,  broke  one  off,
and came to rest deep in the roof of her mouth. This accident
caused  her  to  suffer  severe  pain  and  to  incur  medical
expenses of $700.

The plaintiff brought two claims for damages: one against the
local grocery and the other against Beef Company. The claims
were tried together. At the trial, the plaintiff proved all of the
above facts leading up to her injury as well as the elements of
her damage. Beef Company proved that it had not processed
and packed the corned beef, but that such had been done by its
regular  and  independent  supplier,  Meat  Packing  Company.
Beef Company further proved that it had never obtained from
Meat  Packing  Company  defective  meat  products,  and  that  it
had no way of knowing that the can contained any dangerous
material.  The  grocery  proved  that  it  had  no  way  of  knowing
the content of the can was likely to cause harm, and that it had
sold  the  products  of  Beef  Company  for  a  number  of  years
without ever having been told by a customer that the products
were defective. Both defendants agreed by stipulation in open
court  that  Meat  Packing  Company  had  been  guilty  of
negligence in packing the corned beef containing the sliver of
bone. The jurisdiction still follows common-law contributory
negligence.
If  the  plaintiff’s  claim  against  the  grocery  is  based  on  a
negligence theory, the plaintiff will

(A)    recover,  because  the  negligence  of  Meat  Packing
Company  follows  passage  of  title  of  the  product  to  the
grocery.

(B)  recover, because the grocery is liable for the negligence
of Meat Packing Company since they are joint venturers.
(C)    not  recover,  because  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
grocery  failed  to  exercise  due  care  in  selling  her  the
corned beef.

(D)    not  recover,  because  she  was  guilty  of  contributory
negligence  when  she  selected  the  can  containing  the
sliver of bone.

Answer 23:  The  correct  choice  is  (C),  because  it  correctly
identifies  why  the  grocery  won’t  be  liable:  It  wasn’t

690

negligent. As in any negligence claim, a product liability suit
predicated on negligence requires proof that (1) the defendant
failed  to  exercise  such  care  as  a  reasonable  person  in  his
position  would  have  exercised,  (2)  the  failure  was  a  breach
of the duty to prevent the foreseeable risk of harm to anyone
in  the  plaintiff’s  position,  and  (3)  this  breach  caused  the
plaintiff’s damages. The details of the duty vary depending on
whether  the  defendant  is  a  manufacturer,  wholesaler,  or
retailer. As a retailer, the grocery would be liable for its own
affirmative  negligence  in  handling  products.  For  instance,  a
retailer does have a responsibility to inspect for defects if it
has any reason to believe the product is likely to be defective
(e.g.,  a  broken  seal,  or  past  defective  products  from  the
source in question).

Here,  the  grocery  was  not  affirmatively  negligent,  and  since
the defect was inside the can, there was nothing to trigger the
grocery’s  duty  to  inspect.  Thus,  it  cannot  be  liable  for
negligence

(A) is wrong, because it misstates the law: Negligence does
not, in fact, follow passage of title. As a retailer, the grocery
would  only  be  liable  for  its  own  affirmative  negligence  in
handling  the  product.  For  instance,  a  retailer  does  have  a
responsibility  to  inspect  for  defects  if  it  has  any  reason  to
believe  the  product  is  likely  to  be  defective  (e.g.,  a  broken
seal, or past defective products from the source in question).
Here,  the  grocery  was  not  affirmatively  negligent,  and  since
the  can  itself  was  not  defective,  the  local  grocery  did  not
breach a duty by failing to inspect. Since negligence requires
a failure to exercise due care, the grocery can’t be liable for
negligence on these facts.
If  you  chose  this  response,  you  may  have  been  thinking  of
strict  liability,  although  the  reasoning  in  Choice  A  isn’t  an
accurate  statement  of  that  doctrine,  either.  However,  under
strict  liability,  the  defendant  is  liable  if  the  product  was
dangerously defective when it left his control, even if he had
nothing at all to do with its defective condition. Thus, under
strict  liability,  the  local  grocery  would  get  tagged  with
liability (since if the product was ever dangerously defective,
it had that status when it left the grocery). But the claim here

691

is for negligence, not strict liability.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  it  mischaracterizes  the  facts.  A  joint
venture is similar to a partnership, but generally it is entered
into  for  a  limited  time  and  purpose.  The  two  identifying
elements are a common purpose and a mutual right of control.
B is theoretically correct as an abstract statement of law: One
joint venturer is liable for the torts committed by the other if
the torts are committed in the scope of the venture (most joint
venture  cases  involve  automobile  trips).  Here,  there  was  no
mutual  right  of  control  between  the  Meat  Packing  Company
and  the  grocery,  so  the  grocery  can’t  be  liable  for  the  Meat
Packing Company’s negligence on a joint-venture theory.

(D)  is  wrong,  because  the  reasoning  does  not  support  a
contributory  negligence  defense.  Contributory  negligence,
where it still applies, is a defense to a negligence claim if it
meets this standard: A plaintiff’s conduct must fail to meet the
standard of care for his own protection, and that failure must
cause his harm. Here, there was nothing to trigger any alarm
in  the  plaintiff,  since  the  can  looked  fine.  So  the  plaintiff
could not have been contributorily negligent.

1.  Failure to supervise customers or others

Question  24:  Dora,  who  was  eight  years  old,  went  to  the
grocery  store  with  her  mother.  Dora  pushed  the  grocery  cart
while  her  mother  put  items  into  it.  Dora’s  mother  remained
near Dora at all times. Peterson, another customer in the store,
noticed  Dora  pushing  the  cart  in  a  manner  that  caused
Peterson  no  concern.  A  short  time  later,  the  cart  Dora  was
pushing struck Peterson in the knee, inflicting serious injury. If
Peterson  brings  an  action,  based  on  negligence,  against  the
grocery store, the store’s best defense will be that

(A)  a store owes no duty to its customers to control the use of

its shopping carts.

(B)    a  store  owes  no  duty  to  its  customers  to  control  the

conduct of other customers.

(C)  any negligence of the store was not the proximate cause of

Peterson’s injury.

(D)    a  supervised  child  pushing  a  cart  does  not  pose  an

unreasonable risk to other customers.

692

Answer  24:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Grocery  store  shoppers
are  invitees — members  of  the  public  who  come  onto  land
held  open  to  them  and  who  do  so  for  the  purpose  for  which
the land is held open. Such people reasonably expect that the
premises have been made safe for them, and the owner must
exercise  reasonable  care  for  the  safety  of  such  people.
Reasonable care by the owner may require that she exercise
control  over  third  persons  on  the  premises.  But  the  fact
pattern indicates that Dora’s mother was near her at all times
and  that  the  plaintiff  herself  was  not  concerned  by  Dora’s
pushing  of  the  grocery  cart.  Under  these  circumstances,  it
does not appear that Dora posed an unreasonable risk to the
grocery  shoppers.  Therefore,  the  store  acted  reasonably  and
should not be held responsible for her actions.

(A)      is  wrong  because,  as  discussed  in  Choice  (D),  a  store
does  owe  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  provide  for  the
safety  of  its  invitees — this  duty  would  likely  include
reasonable  attempts  to  protect  customers  from  various
harms that might foreseeably result from shopping carts.
(B)      is  wrong  because,  as  discussed  in  Choice  (D),  a  store
does  owe  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  provide  for  the
safety  of  its  invitees,  and  this  might  include  trying  to
protect  them  from  harm  posed  by  other  customers.  For
instance,  had  Dora  been  an  unsupervised  cart-pushing
menace about whom customers had complained, then the
store, under its duty of reasonable care, would have had
to  control  her  actions  for  the  safety  of  its  invitees.
However,  the  store  did  not  act  unreasonably  under  the
circumstances presented in the fact pattern, as discussed
in the explanation of Choice D.

(C)   is wrong because on the facts here, “lack of negligence”
than  “lack  of
is  more  convincing 
(Choice  (D)) 
proximate” cause. If Dora had posed a foreseeable risk
of injury to Peterson, while on the store’s premises and
using an instrument (the cart) belonging to the store, the
store’s failure to intervene would  be  a  proximate  cause
of  Peterson’s  injuries.  (By  using  the  phrase  “the
proximate  cause”  instead  of  “a  proximate  cause,”  this
choice  incorrectly  suggests  that  there  can  be  only  one

693

proximate  cause.  If  the  store  negligently  failed  to
supervise  Dora  or  intervene  to  take  the  cart  away  from
her, both the store’s failure and Dora’s conduct would be
proximate causes.)

Question  25:  Ohner  owns  the  Acme  Hotel.  When  the
International  Order  of  Badgers  came  to  town  for  its
convention, its members rented 400 of the 500 rooms, and the
hotel opened its convention facilities to them. Badgers are a
rowdy  group,  and  during  their  convention  they  littered  both
the inside and the outside of the hotel with debris and bottles.
The hotel manager knew that objects were being thrown out of
the  hotel  windows.  At  his  direction,  hotel  employees
patrolled the hallways telling the guests to refrain from such
conduct.  Ohner  was  out  of  town  and  was  not  aware  of  the
problems  which  were  occurring.  During  the  convention,  as
Smith  walked  past  the  Acme  Hotel  on  the  sidewalk,  he  was
hit  and  injured  by  an  ashtray  thrown  out  of  a  window  in  the
hotel. Smith sued Ohner for damages for his injuries.
Will Smith prevail in his claim against Ohner?
(A)  Yes, because a property owner is strictly liable for acts
on his premises if such acts cause harm to persons using
the adjacent public sidewalks.

(B)    Yes,  if  the  person  who  threw  the  ashtray  cannot  be

identified.

(C)    No,  because  Ohner  had  no  personal  knowledge  of  the

conduct of the hotel guests.

(D)  No, if the trier of fact determines that the hotel employees
had  taken  reasonable  precautions  to  prevent  such  an
injury.

Answer 25: Choice (D) is correct. The most likely basis on
which  Ohner  would  be  liable  is  vicarious  liability  for  the
negligence  of  his  employees  in  failing  to  take  reasonable
precautions for the safety of passersby. The facts here tell you
that hotel employees patrolled the hallways, telling the guests
to refrain from destructive conduct (of the type which injured
Smith). It’s clear that the employees couldn’t stop guests from
misbehaving,  so  it’s  possible  that  such  patrols  would  be
considered  reasonable  precautions  to  prevent  injuries  like

694

Smith’s. Negligence requires unreasonable conduct, so if the
employees were reasonable in their behavior, there could be
no basis for negligence, and Ohner would not be liable.

(A)   is not the best response, because it misstates the law, and
arrives  at  an  incorrect  result.  Without  more,  a  property
owner is not strictly liable for acts on his premises vis-
à-vis any adjacent property, public or private. Instead, in
order to be strictly liable, the owner (or his employees)
will have to engage in some activity that involves strict
liability — e.g., an ultrahazardous activity, like blasting.
(B)      is  wrong  because  it  assumes  the  applicability  of  a
doctrine  that  doesn’t  in  fact  apply  to  these  facts.  The
examiners  are  probably  trying  to  trick  you  into  thinking
that  res  ipsa  loquitur  applies — they  are  guessing  that
you’ll remember that the doctrine originated in a case in
which a barrel of flour fell from an upper-story window
and injured a passerby. But res ipsa applies only where
the accident is of a type that ordinarily would not occur
without  the  negligence  of  the  defendant.  That,  in  turn,
means  that  the  doctrine  usually  doesn’t  apply  where,
even though we don’t know exactly who was negligent,
we  have  reason  to  believe  that  the  tortfeasor  was
someone other than the defendant. Here, even if we don’t
know  who  threw  the  ashtray,  it’s  likely  that  it  was
thrown  by  a  Badger,  and  not  by  (or  in  the  face  of
negligence  by)  a  hotel  employee.  So  res  ipsa  wouldn’t
apply,  and  the  lack  of  precise  identification  of  the
thrower won’t matter.

(C)   is not the best response, because it turns on an irrelevant
fact.  If  Ohner’s  employees  were  negligent  within  the
scope  of  their  employment  and  Smith  was  injured  as  a
result, Ohner would be liable on the basis of respondeat
superior  regardless  of  whether  he  had  personal
knowledge of his guests’ behavior.

II.   VIOLATION OF STATUTE

A.   Statute must apply to facts

1.  Protection against particular type of risk

695

Question 26: A pedestrian started north across the street in a
clearly  marked  north-south  crosswalk  with  the  green  traffic
light  in  her  favor.  The  pedestrian  was  in  a  hurry,  and  so
before reaching the north curb on the street, she cut to her left
diagonally  across  the  street  to  the  east-west  crosswalk  and
started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk,
the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about
five  steps  further  across  the  street  to  the  west  in  the
crosswalk,  when  she  was  struck  by  a  car  approaching  from
her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car was
driven by a driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car
after  seeing  that  the  traffic  light  was  red  against  him.  As  a
result of the impact, the pedestrian suffered a broken leg.

The pedestrian has filed suit against the driver. The driver’s
attorney has alleged that the pedestrian violated a state statute
requiring  that  pedestrians  stay  in  crosswalks,  and  that  if  the
pedestrian had not violated the statute she would have had to
walk  25  feet  more  to  reach  the  impact  point  and  therefore
would not have been at a place where she could have been hit
by the driver. The pedestrian’s attorney ascertains that there is
a  statute  as  alleged  by  the  driver,  that  his  measurements  are
correct,  that  there  is  a  state  statute  requiring  observance  of
traffic lights, and that the driver’s license expired two years
jurisdiction  follows  pure
prior 
comparative negligence.

the  collision.  The 

to 

The  violation  of  the  crosswalk  statute  by  the  pedestrian
should not reduce her recovery in an action against the driver
because

(A)  the driver violated the traffic light statute at a later point

in time than the pedestrian’s violation.

(B)  pedestrians are entitled to assume that automobile drivers

will obey the law.

(C)  the pedestrian was hit while in the crosswalk.
(D)  the risks that the statute was designed to protect against
probably  did  not  include  an  earlier  arrival  at  another
point.

Answer 26:  The  correct  choice  is  (D),  because  it  identifies
the argument most likely to stop the statutory standard of care

696

from  constituting  comparative  fault  that  would  reduce  the
pedestrian’s claim against the driver.

The pedestrian’s violating the crosswalk statute could reduce
her recovery if it established comparative negligence per se.
Here  is  the  general  rule  on  negligence  per  se:  “an  actor  is
negligent if, without excuse, the actor violates a statute that is
designed to protect against the type of accident the actor’s
conduct causes, and if the accident victim is within the class
of persons the statute is designed to protect.” Rest. 3d (Liab.
For Phys. Harm) §14.

Where it is the defendant who is claiming that the plaintiff has
committed  “comparative  negligence  per  se,”  the  standard  is
still  the  one  quoted  above,  except  that  the  violator  of  the
statute  and  the  “accident  victim”  are  the  same  person.  Here,
the  crosswalk  statute  would  be  very  unlikely  to  be  found  to
have  been  “designed  to  protect  against  the  type  of  accident”
that  the  plaintiff’s  violation  caused.  Crosswalk  statutes  are
generally designed to avoid the risk of an immediate collision
occurring  in  the  non-crosswalk  portion  of  the  street,  where
drivers are not expecting a pedestrian to be walking. Such a
statute would be unlikely to be found to have been designed to
reduce the risk that a pedestrian might, by jaywalking, arrive
earlier at some other point where the accident then occurs but
wouldn’t have occurred had there been no jaywalking. To put
it in terms of scope of risk, jaywalking does not increase the
risk that the jaywalker will, after the jaywalking is complete,
be  hit  somewhere  else  by  a  car.  (To  see  this  principle  in  a
typical  defendant-negligence-per-se  setting,  suppose  D
drives over the speed limit at 1:00 PM, and therefore arrives
at a particular crosswalk at 1:25 PM instead of 1:30, where,
while  driving  carefully,  he  hits  the  pedestrian  P — the  fact
that  D’s  1:00  PM  speed-limit  violation  made  the  1:25  PM
accident  factually  possible  doesn’t  mean  that  D  will  be
negligent  per  se,  because  the  1:00  PM  speeding  did  not
increase  the  risk  of  a  later  non-speeding  collision  down  the
road.)

(A) is wrong, because the timing of the violations will not be
relevant  as  to  whether  the  pedestrian’s  violation  of  the
crosswalk  statute  should  count  against  her.  As  discussed  in

697

(D),  the  pedestrian  was  not  comparatively  negligent  per  se.
Therefore,  the  fact  that  the  driver’s  violation  occurred  later
than  the  pedestrian’s  legally-irrelevant  crosswalk  violation
does not make any difference.

(B)  is  wrong,  because  the  reasoning  it  states  would  not  be
sufficient  to  bar  application  of  the  statute  against  the
pedestrian. Even though one may assume that others will obey
the  law,  this  doesn’t  give  one  a  license  to  act  unreasonably
regarding  one’s  own  safety.  Looked  at  another  way,  the
pedestrian  had  no  more  right  to  rely  on  the  driver  than  the
driver had to rely on her. So if the pedestrian’s violation had
constituted  comparative  negligence  per  se,  her  abstract
entitlement  to  assume  that  the  driver  would  obey  the  traffic-
light  statute  wouldn’t  prevent  the  pedestrian  from  having  the
comparative-negligence-per-se doctrine reduce her recovery.
(Rather,  the  pedestrian  avoids  negligence  per  se  for  the
reason discussed in (D).)

(C)  is  wrong,  because  it  provides  an  insufficient  basis  on
which  to  prevent  application  of  the  crosswalk  statute  to
establish  the  pedestrian’s  comparative  negligence  per  se.  If
the earlier crosswalk violation had satisfied the requirements
for application of comparative negligence per se, the fact that
the  pedestrian  was  later,  at  the  time  of  the  accident,  in  the
crosswalk  wouldn’t  help  her.  (But  comparative  negligence
per  se  doesn’t  apply  against  the  pedestrian,  for  the  reason
discussed in (D).)

III.  RES IPSA LOQUITUR

A.  P’s failure to exclude other causes

1.  Object falling from window in multi-tenant building

Question 27: Landco owns and operates a 12-story apartment
building  containing  72  apartments,  70  of  which  are  rented.
Walker  has  brought  an  action  against  Landco  alleging  that
while  he  was  walking  along  a  public  sidewalk  adjacent  to
Landco’s apartment building a flower pot fell from above and
struck  him  on  the  shoulder,  causing  extensive  injuries.  The
action was to recover damages for those injuries.

698

If  Walker  proves  the  foregoing  facts  and  offers  no  other
evidence  explaining  the  accident,  will  his  claim  survive  a
motion for directed verdict offered by the defense?

(A)    Yes,  because  Walker  was  injured  by  an  artificial
condition of the premises while using an adjacent public
way.

(B)  Yes, because such an accident does not ordinarily happen

in the absence of negligence.

(C)    No,  if  Landco  is  in  no  better  position  than  Walker  to

explain the accident.

(D)  No, because there is no basis for a reasonable inference

that Landco was negligent.

Answer  27:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Walker’s  only  hope  of
prevailing would be res ipsa loquitur, since there’s no direct
proof of negligence by Landco or anyone for whose conduct
Landco  is  responsible.  The  doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur
allows the plaintiff to point to the fact of the accident, and to
create  an  inference  that,  even  without  a  precise  showing  of
how  the  defendant  behaved,  the  defendant  was  probably
negligent.  The  courts  generally  agree  on  four  requirements
before  the  doctrine  may  be  applied:  (1)  there  must  be  no
direct evidence of the defendant’s conduct; (2) the event must
be  of  a  kind  which  ordinarily  does  not  occur  except  through
negligence;  (3)  the  instrument  which  caused  the  injury  must
have been, at the relevant time, in the exclusive control of the
defendant; and (4) plaintiff must show that her injury was not
due to her own action. It is questionable whether at least two
of  these  requirements  are  fulfilled.  Requirement  (3)  would
require that the flower pot have been in the exclusive control
of  Landco,  which  is  not  the  case  (given  that  70  of  the  72
apartments  have  been  rented  to  third  persons  for  whose
liable).
behavior  Landco  would  not  be  vicariously 
Requirement (2) would require proof that a flower pot usually
does not fall without negligence, which is not true. Therefore,
the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur could not be applied here.
(A)   is wrong because: (1) a landowner is not strictly liable
for injuries from an artificial condition to persons on an
adjacent  public  way  (only  required  to  use  reasonable
care  to  prevent  such  injuries);  and  (2)  there’s  no

699

evidence here that Landco failed to use reasonable care
in trying to prevent such accidents (since flowerpots on
windowsills are not all that dangerous, and in any event
there’s  no  evidence  that  Landco  even  knew  of  the
particular  flowerpot,  or  had  any  practical  right  to  have
the pot taken off the sill by what was probably a tenant
who was not under Landco’s direct control).

(B)   is wrong because, as discussed in (D), it is possible for
a flower pot to fall and for it not to be due to negligence.
Furthermore,  even  if  the  falling  pot  was  due  to
someone’s  negligence,  that  someone  was  probably  not
Landco  (since  70  of  72  apartments  were  rented  to
outsiders), and was not someone for whose acts Landco
was  vicariously  responsible.  (A 
is  not
vicariously liable for torts committed by a tenant.) So the
statement  in  this  choice  is  both  probably  untrue  as  a
factual matter, and legally irrelevant.

landlord 

(C)   is wrong because this factor wouldn’t make a difference.
It’s  true  that  some  courts  (though  probably  no  longer  a
majority) will apply res ipsa loquitur only if the plaintiff
can  show  that  a  true  explanation  of  the  events  is  more
readily  accessible  to  the  defendant  than  to  the  plaintiff.
But apart from this factor, the plaintiff must show that the
type  of  accident  usually  doesn’t  happen  without
someone’s  negligence,  and  that  the  defendant  was
probably  in  exclusive  control  of  the  instrumentality  that
caused  the  accident.  As  is  further  discussed  in  (D),  the
plaintiff can’t meet either of these requirements.

B.  Rebuttal evidence

1.  Rebuttal shows some other explanation

a.  Frequent on MBE

Question 28: Defendant left her car parked on the side of a
hill. Two minutes later, the car rolled down the hill and struck
and injured Plaintiff.

In  Plaintiff’s  negligence  action  against  Defendant,  Plaintiff
introduced  into  evidence  the  facts  stated  above,  which  are
undisputed. Defendant testified that, when she parked her ear,
she  turned  the  front  wheels  into  the  curb  and  put  on  her

700

emergency  brakes,  which  were  in  good  working  order.  She
also  introduced  evidence  that,  in  the  weeks  before  this
incident,  juveniles  had  been  seen  tampering  with  cars  in  the
neighborhood.  The  jury  returned  a  verdict  in  favor  of
Defendant,

a 

Plaintiff’s motion should be

(A)    granted,  because  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that
Defendant’s  negligent  conduct  was  the  legal  cause  of
Plaintiff’s injuries.

(B)    granted,  because  the  evidence  does  not  support  the

verdict.

(C)    denied,  because,  given  Defendant’s  evidence,  the  jury
was  not  required  to  draw  an  inference  of  negligence
from the circumstances of the accident.

(D)    denied,  if  Defendant  was  in  no  better  position  than

Plaintiff to explain the accident.

Answer 28: Choice (C)  is  correct.  The  doctrine  of  res  ipsa
loquitur allows the plaintiff to point to the fact of the accident,
and  to  create  an  inference  that,  even  without  a  precise
showing  of  how  the  defendant  behaved,  the  defendant  was
probably  negligent.  The  consequence  of  the  doctrine’s
application  is  that  the  plaintiff  has  met  her  burden  of
production.  The  defendant  may  counter  with  evidence  that
rebuts any or all of the elements required for res ipsa (e.g., by
showing  other  possible  causes  not  involving  the  defendant’s
negligence).  It  will  then  be  up  to  the  jury  to  decide  whether
the defendant’s evidence is enough to negate the inference of
negligence  stemming  from  application  of  res  ipsa.  Here,  the
defendant  provided  enough  evidence  (proper  use  of  the
emergency  brakes  and  evidence  of  juveniles  tampering  with
cars in the neighborhood) that a jury was not required to infer
negligence  of  the  defendant  from  the  fact  that  the  defendant
parked her car and two minutes later it rolled down the hill.
(A)  and  (B)  are  wrong  because,  as  discussed  in  the
explanation  of  (C),  there  was  enough  evidence  provided  by
the  defendant  to  entitle  a  reasonable  jury  to  conclude  that  it
should  not  apply  res  ipsa,  i.e.,  that  it  should  not  infer

701

negligence.  This  fact  will  be  dispositive,  since  the  verdict-
loser’s  motion  for  a  JNOV  should  be  granted  only  if  there
was not enough evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find
for the verdict-winner.

(D)      is  wrong  because  it  focuses  on  a  factor  that  won’t  be
dispositive.  It’s  true  that  some  courts  (though  probably
no longer a majority) hold that in order for the plaintiff
to benefit from res ipsa loquitur, the plaintiff must show
that  a  true  explanation  of  the  events  is  more  readily
accessible  to  the  defendant  than  to  the  plaintiff.  But  the
court  probably  wouldn’t  apply  this  rule,  and  even  if  it
did, the plaintiff will lose because the defendant came up
with  enough  evidence  that  a  reasonable  jury  could  find
that  the  inference  of  negligence  by  the  defendant  was
unjustified.

CHAPTER 5
ACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSE

I.    CAUSATION IN FACT

A.  “But-for” test

1.  Must be tied to D’s negligence

a.  Rescue scenarios

Question  29:  Desmond  fell  while  attempting  to  climb  a
mountain,  and  lay  unconscious  and  critically  injured  on  a
ledge  that  was  difficult  to  reach.  Pearson,  an  experienced
mountain climber, was himself seriously injured while trying
to  rescue  Desmond.  Pearson’s  rescue  attempt  failed,  and
Desmond died of his injuries before he could be reached.

Pearson  brought  an  action  against  Desmond’s  estate  for
compensation  for  his  injuries.  In  this  jurisdiction,  the
traditional  common-law 
to  contributory
rules 
negligence and assumption of risk remain in effect.
Will Pearson prevail in his action against Desmond’s estate?
(A)  Yes, if his rescue attempt was reasonable.
(B)    Yes,  because  the  law  should  not  discourage  attempts  to

relating 

assist persons in helpless peril.

(C)  No, unless Desmond’s peril arose from his own failure to

exercise reasonable care.

(D)    No,  because  Pearson’s  rescue  attempt  failed  and

therefore did not benefit Desmond.

Answer  29:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  A  rescuer  who  sustains
injuries  can  recover  from  the  rescuee,  if  the  rescuee  acted
negligently  in  putting  himself  in  the  position  of  needing
rescue.  But  if  the  rescuee  did  not  act  negligently  (or  any
negligence  did  not  contribute  directly  to  the  arising  of  the
peril),  then  the  rescuer  would  not  be  permitted  to  recover,
even  though  the  peril  was  the  proximate  cause  and  cause  in
fact of the harm to the rescuer.
(A)   is wrong because, even if Pearson’s rescue attempt was
reasonable, if it was not in response to a danger caused

703

by  the  Desmond’s  negligence,  then  Pearson  would  not
prevail in an action against defendant for his injuries.
(B)      is  wrong  because,  even  if  rescue  attempts  should  be
encouraged,  if  Pearson’s  rescue  attempt  was  not  in
response 
the  Desmond’s
negligence, then Pearson would not prevail in an action
against defendant for his injuries.

to  a  danger  caused  by 

(D)      is  wrong  because,  even  though  Desmond  didn’t  benefit
from  the  rescue  attempt,  he  would  still  be  liable  to  the
rescuer  if  the  rescue  attempt  was  in  response  to
Desmond’s own negligence in putting himself in need of
rescue.

II.   PROXIMATE CAUSE — FORESEEABILITY

A.  How tested on the MBE

Question 30: Doe negligently caused a fire in his house, and
the house burned to the ground. As a result, the sun streamed
into  Peter’s  yard  next  door,  which  previously  had  been
shaded by Doe’s house. The sunshine destroyed some delicate
and valuable trees in Peter’s yard that could grow only in the
shade. Peter has brought a negligence action against Doe for
the  loss  of  Peter’s  trees.  Doe  has  moved  to  dismiss  the
complaint.

The best argument in support of this motion would be that

(A)  Doe’s negligence was not the active cause of the loss of

Peter’s trees.

(B)    Doe’s  duty  to  avoid  the  risks  created  by  a  fire  did  not
encompass  the  risk  that  sunshine  would  damage  Peter’s
trees.

(C)    the  loss  of  the  trees  was  not  a  natural  and  probable

consequence of Doe’s negligence.

(D)    Peter  suffered  a  purely  economic  loss,  which  is  not

compensable in a negligence action.

Answer 30: Choice (B) is correct. Doe’s liability extends to
foreseeable damages from a fire. It was not foreseeable that a
fire  would  damage  trees  by  depriving  them  of  the  structure
that  was  sustaining  them  by  providing  shade.  Had  the  trees

704

burned down, this would be a foreseeable consequence of the
fire, but that was not the case here.

(A)   is wrong because Doe’s negligence did in fact cause the

loss of the trees, albeit in an unexpected manner.

(C)      is  wrong  because  the  loss  of  trees  is  a  natural  and
probable  consequence  of  a  fire.  The  manner  in  which
Peter’s  trees  were  lost  was  not  foreseeable,  however,
which is why Choice (B) is the correct answer.

(D)   is wrong because Peter suffered property damage, which
is compensable in a negligence action. Examples of pure
economic  loss  are  loss  of  profits  or  wages.  Property
damage does not fall under this category.

collision with a car driven by a sightseer. The accident was
caused solely by the sightseer’s negligence. The driver’s car
was  still  drivable  after  the  accident.  Examining  the  car  the
next morning, the driver could see that a rear fender had to be
replaced. He also noticed that gasoline had dripped onto the
garage  floor.  The  collision  had  caused  a  small  leak  in  the
gasoline tank.

The  driver  then  took  the  car  to  a  mechanic,  who  owns  and
operates  a  body  shop,  and  arranged  with  the  mechanic  to
repair  the  damage.  During  their  discussion  the  driver
neglected  to  mention  the  gasoline  leakage.  Thereafter,  while
the  mechanic  was  loosening  some  of  the  damaged  material
with a hammer, he caused a spark, igniting vapor and gasoline
that had leaked from the fuel tank. The mechanic was severely
burned.
The  mechanic  has  brought  an  action  to  recover  damages
against  the  driver  and  the  sightseer.  The  jurisdiction  has
adopted  a  pure  comparative  negligence  rule  in  place  of  the
traditional common-law rule of contributory negligence.

705

In this action, will the mechanic obtain a judgment against the
sightseer?

(A)  No, unless there is evidence that the sightseer was aware

of the gasoline leak.

(B)  No, if the mechanic would not have been harmed had the

driver warned him about the gasoline leak.

(C)  Yes, unless the mechanic was negligent in not discovering

(D) 

the gasoline leak himself.
  Yes,  if  the  mechanic’s  injury  was  a  proximate
consequence of the sightseer’s negligent driving.

Answer 31: Choice (D) is correct. Under the prevailing view
of  proximate  cause,  the  defendant’s  negligent  conduct  is  the
(or a) proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury if (and only if)
the  general  type  of  harm  that  occurred  to  the  plaintiff  was  a
reasonably  foreseeable  consequence  of 
the  defendant’s
negligent  action.  Choice  (D)  articulates  this  standard.  We
cannot  definitively  say  on  these  facts  that  the  mechanic’s
injury was in fact a proximate consequence of the sightseer’s
negligent  driving — but  if  it  was  a  proximate  consequence,
the  mechanic  would  be  entitled  to  at  least  partial  recovery
from 
the  sightseer,  under  pure  comparative-negligence
principles.  By  the  way,  the  fact  that  the  accident  might  have
been  avoided  by  a  warning  from  the  driver  won’t  get  the
sightseer  off  the  hook  (see  the  discussion  of  Choice  (B)  for
why).  If  the  driver’s  failure  to  mention  the  leak  constituted
negligence by him, this would reduce the sightseer’s share of
the  judgment  under  comparative  negligence,  but  it  wouldn’t
eliminate the sightseer’s liability.

(A) is wrong because the sightseer’s liability arises out of his
negligent driving, not his awareness of the gasoline leak. If it
was  a  foreseeable  consequence  of  that  negligent  driving  that
some repairer of the other party’s car might be hurt as a result,
the  sightseer  will  be  liable  even  though  he  never  knew
precisely  in  what  way  his  negligence  created  the  special
danger to the repairer. In other words, liability depends on the
foreseeable consequences of the negligently-caused event (the
accident), not from whether the negligent actor was or wasn’t
aware of how the danger arose.

706

(B) is wrong because the lack of such a warning would not be
deemed to have broken the causal link between the sighseer’s
negligent driving and the injury to the mechanic. In general, a
third party’s failure to discover or warn of a danger caused by
the defendant will not insulate the defendant from negligence
liability, even if a warning would have eliminated the danger.
Especially  in  a  comparative-negligence  jurisdiction  such  as
the  one  here,  even  if  the  driver’s  failure  to  mention  the  leak
was negligence, a court would almost certainly conclude that
this  failure  was  not  a  “superseding  cause,”  and  was  merely
co-negligence  (which  would  serve  to  reduce  the  sightseer’s
liability to the mechanic but not eliminate it).

(C)  is  wrong  because  even  had  the  mechanic  negligently
failed  to  discover  the  danger,  he  would  still  be  entitled  to
recovery. In a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction such
as the one here, the plaintiff’s negligent failure to discover a
danger  caused  by  the  defendant  will  not  eliminate  the
defendant’s  liability,  merely  reduce  it.  Since  the  sightseer
would be otherwise liable to the mechanic if the accident was
a  proximate  consequence  of  the  sightseer’s  negligent  driving
(see Choice (D)), this result would still be true in the face of
the mechanic’s negligent failure to discover the danger.

B.  Foreseeable intervening causes

1.  “Second collision” scenarios

Question  32:  While  driving  at  a  speed  in  excess  of  the
statutory limit, Dant negligently collided with another car, and
the  disabled  vehicles  blocked  two  of  the  highway’s  three
northbound  lanes.  When  Page  approached  the  scene  two
minutes later, he slowed his car to see if he could help those
involved  in  the  collision.  As  he  slowed,  he  was  rear-ended
by a vehicle driven by Thomas. Page, who sustained damage
to his car and was seriously injured, brought an action against
Dant  to  recover  damages.  The  jurisdiction  adheres  to  the
traditional  common-law  rules  pertaining  to  contributory
negligence.

If Dant moves to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim
upon  which  relief  may  be  granted,  should  the  motion  be
granted?

707

(A)  Yes, because it was Thomas, not Dant, who collided with

Page’s car and caused Page’s injuries.

(B)    Yes,  if  Page  could  have  safely  passed  the  disabled

vehicles in the traffic lane that remained open.

(C)    No,  because  a  jury  could  find  that  Page’s  injury  arose
from a risk that was a continuing consequence of Dant’s
negligence.

(D)  No, because Dant was driving in excess of the statutory
limit when he negligently caused the first accident.
Answer 32: Choice (C)  is  correct.  Dant’s  initial  negligence
brought about the condition in which lanes were blocked, and
in  which  other  drivers  might  slow  down  to  rubberneck.  The
fact that other drivers might behave in this way (and that one
of the slowing drivers might in turn cause a second accident)
was  relatively  foreseeable.  At  the  least,  a  reasonable  jury
could find (even if it need not find) that the causal connection
between  Dant’s  initial  negligence  and  the  second  accident
was not so far-fetched or attenuated that the second accident
(and  Thomas’s  negligence)  should  be  regarded  as  a
superseding  cause.  Remember,  a  second  event  must  be  very,
very  bizarre  and  hard  to  foresee  before  it  will  be  deemed
superseding.

(A)      is  wrong  because,  although  Dant  did  not  collide  with
Page’s car, Dant’s negligence proximately caused Page’s
injuries, as discussed in Choice C.

(B)   is wrong because, even if Page could have safely passed
the disabled vehicles, it is probably not the case that his
not  doing  so  would  constitute  contributory  negligence.
This jurisdiction adheres to the traditional common-law
rules pertaining to contributory negligence, under which
the  plaintiff  will  be  barred  from  recovering  if  he  was
contributorily  negligent.  Page’s  action  in  slowing  down
his  car  when  he  saw  that  an  accident  had  blocked  two
lanes of traffic, and his intention to see if he could help,
were  probably  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.
Therefore, he was not contributorily negligent.

(D)   is wrong because it doesn’t address the key factor. Dant
was  clearly  negligent  in  causing  the  first  accident — 
that’s  not  disputed.  The  interesting  question  is  whether

708

the connection between the first accident and the second
one involving Page was so attenuated that the second (or
Page’s  negligence  in  bringing  about  the  second)  should
be  viewed  as  superseding.  Since  this  choice  doesn’t
refer to this key issue, it’s not the best answer.

C.  Responses to defendant’s actions

1.  Escape

Question  33:  While  Driver  was  taking  a  leisurely  spring
drive,  he  momentarily  took  his  eyes  off  the  road  to  look  at
some colorful trees in bloom. As a result, his car swerved a
few  feet  off  the  roadway,  directly  toward  Walker,  who  was
standing  on  the  shoulder  of  the  road  waiting  for  a  chance  to
cross.  When  Walker  saw  the  car  bearing  down  on  him,  he
jumped backwards, fell, and injured his knee.

Walker  sued  Driver  for  damages,  and  Driver  moved  for
summary judgment. The foregoing facts are undisputed.

Driver’s motion should be

(A) 

  denied,  because 
that  Walker
apprehended an imminent, harmful contact with Driver’s
car.

the  record  shows 

(B)  denied, because a jury could find that Driver negligently
caused Walker to suffer a legally compensable injury.
(C)  granted, because the proximate cause of Walker’s injury

was his own voluntary act.

(D)  granted, because it is not unreasonable for a person to be

distracted momentarily.

Answer 33:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  When  A  puts  B  in  peril,
it’s  typically  quite  foreseeable  that  B  will  try  to  escape  the
peril. Therefore, if A acted negligently in putting B in peril, A
will  be  liable  for  injury  to  B  that  occurs  during  B’s
foreseeable efforts to escape the peril. Here, it’s completely
foreseeable  that  one  in  Walker’s  position  might  jump
backwards  to  escape  the  oncoming  car,  and  thereby  be
injured. That’s all that this choice is asserting.
(A)      is  wrong  because  Driver’s  actions  were  negligent  and
apprehension  of  an  imminent  harmful  contact  is  the
definition of an assault, an intentional tort.

709

(C)      is  wrong  because,  when  A  is  put  in  peril  by  B’s
negligence, A’s efforts to escape the peril — unless they
are  truly  bizarre  and  unforeseeable — won’t  act  as
superseding causes. So while Walker’s injury may have
been  due  in  part  to  his  “voluntary  act”  of  jumping
backward, 
this  certainly  doesn’t  prevent  Driver’s
negligence  from  also  being  a  proximate  cause  of  the
injury.  (Remember  that  there  can  be,  and  often  are,
multiple proximate causes for a given event.) Given that
Walker’s behavior in jumping wasn’t even negligent, it’s
even  less  likely  that  his  behavior  would  let  Driver  off
the hook on proximate-cause grounds.

this  case 

(D)      is  wrong  because,  although  sometimes  it  may  not  be
unreasonable for a person to be distracted momentarily,
In  assessing
it  was  unreasonable. 
in 
reasonableness, courts do a cost-benefit analysis. Here,
a driver’s looking at “colorful trees in bloom” during a
“leisurely spring drive” is certainly not an event whose
social value outweighs the major risk to others.

D.  Third person’s failure to discover, warn about or avoid the danger

Question 34:  A  motorist  was  driving  north  on  an  interstate
highway at about 50 miles per hour when a tractor-trailer rig,
owned  and  driven  by  a  trucker,  passed  her.  The  tractor  was
pulling  a  refrigerated  meat  trailer  fully  loaded  with  beef
carcasses  hanging  freely  from  the  trailer  ceiling.  When  the
trucker cut back in front of the motorist, the shifting weight of
the  beef  caused  the  trailer  to  overturn.  The  motorist  was
unable  to  avoid  a  collision  with  the  overturned  trailer  and
was injured.

The  trailer  had  been  manufactured  by  a  trailer  company.  A
number of truckers had complained to the trailer company that
the  design  of  the  trailer,  which  allowed  the  load  to  swing
freely, was dangerous. An alternative design could have been
used, at little extra financial or functionality cost to the trailer
company, 
load-swinging
problem. The trucker knew of the dangerous propensity of the
trailer.  A  restraining  device  that  could  be  installed  in  the
trailer would prevent the load from shifting and was available
at  nominal  cost.  The  trucker  knew  of  the  restraining  device

that  would  have  avoided 

the 

710

but  had  not  installed  it.  The  jurisdiction  has  adopted  a  pure
comparative fault rule in strict liability cases.

If the motorist asserts a claim based on strict liability in tort
against the trailer company, she will

(A)  recover, unless the motorist was negligently driving when

(B) 

the truck overturned.
  recover,  because  the  trucker’s  knowledge  of  the
dangerous  propensity  of  the  trailer  does  not  relieve  the
trailer company of liability.

(C)    not  recover,  because  there  was  no  privity  of  contract

between the motorist and the trailer company.

(D)    not  recover  if  the  trucker  was  negligent  in  failing  to

install the restraining device in the trailer.

Answer  34:  The  correct  choice  is  (B).  First,  the  trucking
company’s  failure  to  use  a  reasonably  available  alternative
design  constituted  strict  product  liability  of  the  defective-
design  variety.  See  Rest.  3d  (Prod.  Liab.)  §2(b),  defining  a
product as being “defective in design” (and thus giving rise to
strict product liability) “when the foreseeable risks of harm
posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by
the  adoption  of  a  reasonable  alternative  design  by  the
seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the commercial
chain  of  distribution,  and  the  omission  of  the  alternative
design renders the product not reasonably safe.”

A sticky point here is the effect of the trucker’s realization that
the truck was dangerous, and his failure to buy and install the
restraining  device.  But  as  Choice  B  states,  this  will  not
relieve the trailer company of liability toward the motorist. If
a manufacturer produces a defectively dangerous product, the
manufacturer  will  virtually  never  be 
absolved  of
responsibility  merely  because  some  person  further  down  the
distributive  chain  (e.g.,  a  distributor  or  an  end-user)  either
negligently fails to discover the danger or does discover the
danger but fails to take available steps to remedy it (e.g., by
installing a readily-available and cheap safety device).
(A) is wrong, because it incorrectly suggests that the motorist
will  only  recover  if  she  wasn’t  driving  negligently.  First,
under  these  facts,  there’s  no  evidence  the  motorist  was

711

driving  negligently — you’re  told  that  the  motorist  was
driving 50 m.p.h. on an interstate, and that she was unable to
avoid colliding with the truck. But more importantly, even if
the  motorist  was  driving  negligently,  she  could  still  recover.
You’re told that the jurisdiction has adopted comparative fault
for strict liability cases. So the most that could happen is that
the motorist’s fault would cause her recovery to be reduced,
not  eliminated.  (You’re  asked  whether  the  motorist  can
“recover,”  and  a  recovery  reduced  by  comparative-fault
principles is still a recovery.)

(C) is wrong, because it imposes a privity requirement where,
in  fact,  there  isn’t  one.  There  is  no  privity  requirement  in
strict product liability cases, so a bystander who is injured by
a  defectively  dangerous  product  can  recover  against  the
manufacturer, even though the bystander and the manufacturer
have no contractual or other pre-existing relationship.

(D) is wrong, because even if the trucker was negligent, this
will not relieve the trailer company of strict product liability.
As  the  discussion  of  Choice  (B)  describes,  a  manufacturer
will  virtually  never  be  absolved  of  responsibility  merely
because some person further down the distributive chain (e.g.,
a  distributor  or  an  end-user)  either  negligently  fails  to
discover  the  danger  or  does  discover  the  danger  but  fails  to
take available steps to remedy it.

CHAPTER 6
JOINT TORTFEASORS

I.    JOINT LIABILITY

A.  Joint-and-several liability generally

1.  Meshing with P’s comparative negligence

Question  35:  Jones,  who  was  driving  his  car  at  night,
stopped the car and went into a nearby tavern for a drink. He
left  the  car  standing  at  the  side  of  the  road,  projecting  three
feet  into  the  traffic  lane.  The  lights  were  on  and  his  friend,
Peters, was asleep in the back seat. Peters awoke, discovered
the situation, and went back to sleep. Before Jones returned,
his  car  was  hit  by  an  automobile  approaching  from  the  rear
and driven by Davis. Peters was injured.
Peters sued Davis and Jones jointly to recover the damages he
suffered  resulting  from  the  accident.  The  jurisdiction  has  a
pure  comparative  negligence  rule  and  has  abolished  the
defense  of  assumption  of  risk.  In  respect  to  other  issues,  the
rules of the common law remain in effect.
Peters should recover

(A)  nothing, if Peters was more negligent than either Davis or

Jones.

(B)  nothing, unless the total of Davis’s and Jones’s negligence

was greater than Peters’s.

(C)  from Davis and Jones, jointly and severally, the amount of
damages Peters suffered reduced by the percentage of the
total negligence that is attributed to Peters.

(D)  from Davis and Jones, severally, a percentage of Peters’s
damages  equal  to  the  percentage  of  fault  attributed  to
each of the defendants.

Answer 35: Choice (C) is correct. If more than one person is
a  proximate  cause  of  the  plaintiff’s  harm,  and  the  harm  is
indivisible, then under the traditional common-law rule, each
defendant is liable for the entire harm. Davis and Jones would
be  jointly  and  severally  liable.  In  a  pure  comparative  fault

713

system, the plaintiff is allowed to recover even if his fault is
greater than that of the defendant. The plaintiff’s recovery is
reduced  by  a  proportion  equal  to  the  ratio  between  his  own
fault and the total fault contributing to the accident. Therefore,
Peter’s  recovery  would  be  the  amount  of  damages  suffered
reduced  by  the  percentage  of  the  total  negligence  that  is
attributed to him. And Peter can recover that entire amount of
“net” damages from either defendant.

(A)   and (B) are wrong because in a pure comparative fault
system,  the  plaintiff  is  allowed  to  recover  even  if  the
percentage  of  his  fault  is  greater  than  that  of  either
defendant  or  greater  than  the  fault  of  both  defendants
combined.

(D)   is wrong because the harm is indivisible; therefore, the
liable  (each

jointly  and  severally 

defendants  are 
defendant is liable for the entire harm).

II.   CONTRIBUTION

A.  Contribution generally

1.  Amount

Question  36:  While  driving  his  car,  Plaintiff  sustained
injuries  in  a  three-car  collision.  Plaintiff  sued  the  drivers  of
the  other  two  cars,  D-l  and  D-2,  and  each  defendant
for  contribution.  The
the  other 
crossclaimed  against 
jurisdiction  has  adopted  a  rule  of  pure  comparative
negligence and allows contribution based upon proportionate
fault. The rule of joint-and-several liability has been retained.

The  jury  has  found  that  Plaintiff  sustained  damages  in  the
amount of $100,000, and apportioned the causal negligence of
the parties as follows: Plaintiff 40%, D-l 30%, and D-2 30%.
How  much,  if  anything,  can  Plaintiff  collect  from  D-l,  and
how  much,  if  anything,  can  D-l  then  collect  from  D-2  in
contribution?
(A)  Nothing, and then D-l can collect nothing from D-2.
(B)  $30,000, and then D-l can collect nothing from D-2.
(C)  $40,000, and then D-l can collect $10,000 from D-2.

714

(D)  $60,000, and then D-l can collect $30,000 from D-2.
Answer  36:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  In  a  pure  comparative
negligence  jurisdiction,  the  plaintiff  is  allowed  to  recover
even  if  his  fault  is  greater  than  that  of  the  defendant.  The
plaintiff’s  recovery  is  reduced  by  a  proportion  equal  to  the
ratio  between  his  own  negligence  and  the  total  negligence
contributing  to  the  accident.  Under  the  rule  of  joint-and-
several  liability,  if  two  defendants  acted  separately  to
produce an indivisible harm to the plaintiff, then each can be
required to pay 100% of the plaintiff’s damages. (Of course,
plaintiff can recover only one satisfaction.) A defendant who
is  required  to  pay  more  than  her  fair  share  can  recover  the
balance from the other. So here, Plaintiff can collect the full
$60,000  (the  total  damage  for  which  Plaintiff  himself  is  not
responsible)  from  either  defendant;  the  defendant  who  pays
the  whole  $60,000  may  in  turn  collect  from  the  other  that
portion  representing  the  overpayment.  Since  D-1  has  paid
$60,000  when  his  fair  share  was  only  $30,000,  he  can
recover the $30,000 overpayment from D-2.
(A)      is  wrong  because,  in  a  pure  comparative  negligence
jurisdiction, the plaintiff is allowed to recover even if he
is at fault and even if his fault is greater than that of the
defendant.  (A)  incorrectly  supposes  that  Plaintiff  will
not be able to collect damages because of his own fault.

(B)   is wrong because it does not allow for Plaintiff to collect
the full amount of damages owed to him ($60,000) from
one 
defendant’s
proportional  share  of  the  damages  is  $30,000)  as
provided  under  the  rule  of  joint-and-several  liability.
See the discussion of Choice (D).

defendant 

though 

(even 

each 

(C)      is  wrong  because  it  limits  Plaintiff’s  recovery  to  the
amount  of  his  own  negligence  (40%  of  $100,000).  In  a
pure comparative negligence jurisdiction, the plaintiff is
allowed to recover even if his fault is greater than that of
the  defendant.  The  plaintiff’s  recovery  is  reduced  by  a
proportion equal to the ratio between his own negligence
and the total negligence contributing to the accident. (In
this case the computation produces $100,000 reduced by
40%, or a net of $60,000.)

715

Question  37:  The  plaintiff  sustained  personal  injuries  in  a
three-car collision caused by the concurrent negligence of the
three  drivers,  who  consisted  of  the  plaintiff,  Donald,  and
Drew. In the plaintiff’s action for damages against Donald and
Drew,  the  jury  apportioned  the  negligence  30%  to  the
plaintiff,  30%  to  Donald,  and  40%  to  Drew.  The  plaintiff’s
total  damages  were  $100,000.  Assume  that  a  state  statute
provides for a system of pure comparative negligence, joint-
and
liability  of 
and-several 
contribution based upon proportionate fault.

tortfeasors, 

concurrent 

If  the  plaintiff  chooses  to  execute  against  Donald  alone,  she
will be entitled to collect at most

(A)  $70,000 from Donald, and then Donald will be entitled to

collect $40,000 from Drew.

(B)  $30,000 from Donald, and then Donald will be entitled to

collect $10,000 from Drew.

(C)  $30,000 from Donald, and then Donald will be entitled to

collect nothing from Drew.

(D)    nothing  from  Donald,  because  Donald’s  percentage  of

fault is not greater than that of the plaintiff.

Answer 37:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Under  the  rule  of  joint-
and-several  liability,  if  two  or  more  defendants  are  joint
tortfeasors,  the  plaintiff  may  sue  and  collect  from  either  of
them  or  all  of  them.  In  a  comparative  fault  system,  the
plaintiff’s  recovery  is  reduced  by  a  proportion  equal  to  the
ratio between her own fault and the total fault contributing to
the  accident.  If  the  plaintiff’s  total  damages  were  $100,000,
her damages will be reduced by 30% (her percentage of fault)
for  a  total  of  $70,000.  Where  the  negligence  has  been
apportioned between the two defendants (at 30% for Donald
and  40%  for  Drew),  yet  they  were  joint  tortfeasors,  the
plaintiff  may  collect  the  total  amount  of  damages  from  one
defendant  and 
seek
reimbursement  (“contribution”)  from  the  other  defendant  for
his  share  of  the  damages  award.  So  the  plaintiff  can  collect
$70,000  from  Donald  (i.e.,  the  full  percentage  of  fault
represented  by  all  parties  other  than  plaintiff),  but  Donald
will  then  be  able  to  collect  $40,000  from  Drew  for  the
latter’s share of the damages.

that  defendant  may

then 

716

(B)   is wrong because it allows Donald to be liable for only
his proportion of the damages, which is not the case in a
jurisdiction  applying  joint-and-several  liability.  This
choice  also  allows  Donald  to  recover  $10,000  from
Drew;  however,  in  the  case  that  Donald  paid  only
$30,000, he would not be entitled to contribution, since
he  is  responsible  for  at  least  his  percentage  of  fault
($30,000). In other words, a defendant bringing a third-
party contribution action against another joint tortfeasor
is  entitled  to  contribution  only  if  he  pays  more  than  his
percentage of fault.

(C)   is wrong because it allows for Donald to be liable for
only his proportion of the damages, which is not the case
in a jurisdiction applying joint-and-several liability.
(D)   is wrong because, in a pure comparative fault system, the
plaintiff is allowed to recover even if his fault is greater
than that of the defendant (indeed, even if the plaintiff’s
fault is greater than that of all defendants put together).

III.  INDEMNITY

A.  Negligent vs. intentional tortfeasor

Question 38: David owned a shotgun that he used for hunting.
David  knew  that  his  old  friend,  Mark,  had  become  involved
with a violent gang that recently had a shoot-out with a rival
gang.  David,  who  was  going  to  a  farm  to  hunt  quail,  placed
his loaded shotgun on the back seat of his car. On his way to
the  farm,  David  picked  up  Mark  to  give  him  a  ride  to  a
friend’s house. After dropping off Mark at the friend’s house,
David  proceeded  to  the  farm,  where  he  discovered  that  his
shotgun was missing from his car. Mark had taken the shotgun
and, later in the day, Mark used it to shoot Paul, a member of
the rival gang. Paul was severely injured.
Paul recovered a judgment for his damages against David, as
well  as  Mark,  on  the  ground  that  David  was  negligent  in
allowing  Mark  to  obtain  possession  of  the  gun,  and  was
therefore  liable  jointly  and  severally  with  Mark  for  Paul’s
damages.  The 
that  allows
contribution based upon proportionate fault and adheres to the

jurisdiction  has  a  statute 

717

traditional common-law rules on indemnity.

If David fully satisfies the judgment, David then will have a
right to recover from Mark

(A)    indemnity  for  the  full  amount  of  the  judgment,  because

Mark was an intentional tortfeasor.

(B)    contribution  only,  based  on  comparative  fault,  because

David himself was negligent.

(C)  one-half of the amount of the judgment.
(D)    nothing,  because  David’s  negligence  was  a  substantial

proximate cause of the shooting.

Answer  38:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  If  there  is  a  great
difference  in  the  degree  of  culpability  of  the  defendants,  the
court will shift the financial responsibility for a tort from the
less-culpable  to  the  more-culpable  one,  by  the  use  of  the
doctrine  of  indemnity.  In  this  case,  where  Mark  was  an
intentional  tortfeasor  (causing  severe  injury  with  a  gun)  and
David  was  merely  a  negligent  one  (in  allowing  Mark  to
obtain  possession  of  the  gun),  David  will  have  the  right  to
indemnity, i.e., the right to recover from Mark the full amount
of the judgment that David paid.

(B)      is  wrong  because,  as  stated  in  (A),  David  will  be
indemnified  for  the  full  amount  of  damages  he  paid,
because  of  the  great  difference  in  the  degree  of
culpability of the defendants.

(C)      is  wrong  because  it  incorrectly  implies  that  the  parties
are equally culpable and it does not recognize that David
will  be  indemnified  for  the  full  amount  of  damages
because  of  the  great  difference  in  the  degree  of
culpability of the defendants.

(D)      is  wrong  because,  despite  the  fact  that  David’s
negligence  was  a  proximate  cause  of  the  injury,  David
will  be  indemnified  by  Mark  for  the  full  amount  of
damages.

DUTY

I.    EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

A.  Emotional distress without physical impact

1.  No bodily harm

a.  Exceptions

i.  Negligent handling of corpse

Question  39:  Ann’s  three-year-old  daughter,  Janet,  was
killed  in  an  automobile  accident.  At  Ann’s  direction,  Janet’s
body was taken to a mausoleum for interment. Normally, the
mausoleum’s  vaults  are  permanently  sealed  with  marble
plates secured by “tamper-proof” screws. After Janet’s body
was  placed  in  the  mausoleum,  however,  only  a  fiberglass
panel  secured  by  caulking  compound  covered  her  vault.
About  a  month  later,  Janet’s  body  was  discovered  in  a
cemetery located near the mausoleum. It had apparently been
left there by vandals who had taken it from the mausoleum.

As  a  result  of  this  experience,  Ann  suffered  great  emotional
distress.

If  Ann  sues  the  mausoleum  for  the  damages  arising  from  her
emotional distress, will she prevail?

(A)  No, because Ann experienced no threat to her own safety.
(B)    No,  unless  the  mausoleum’s  behavior  was  extreme  and

outrageous.

(C)    Yes,  if  the  mausoleum  failed  to  use  reasonable  care  to

safeguard the body.

(D)    Yes,  unless  Ann  suffered  no  physical  harm  as  a

consequence of her emotional distress.

Answer  39:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Most  courts  allow
recovery for pure emotional distress, even if unaccompanied
by bodily harm, where the defendant has negligently handled
the  corpse  of  the  plaintiff’s  relative.  This  answer  choice
correctly applies this rule.

719

(A)      is  wrong  because,  although  it  is  generally  true  that  a
plaintiff who does not suffer any physical impact or even
threat  to  her  own  safety  can’t  recover  in  negligence  for
emotional  distress,  there  are  exceptions.  One  exception
is where the plaintiff has suffered emotional distress due
to  the  defendant’s  mishandling  of  a  corpse  belonging  to
the plaintiff’s close relative.

(B)   is wrong because, although it is necessary to show that
the defendant’s behavior was extreme and outrageous in
a suit for intentional infliction of emotional distress, this
is  not  required  to  be  proven  in  a  case  of  negligent
infliction  of  emotional  distress.  And  by  inference,  what
Ann  is  alleging  here  is  negligent,  not  intentional,
infliction of emotional distress.

(D)   is wrong because a claim for negligent mishandling of a
corpse is one of the few special situations where courts
have  allowed  damages  for  pure  emotional  suffering
despite  the  fact  that  the  defendant  has  suffered  no
physical harm.

Question  40:  John’s  father,  Jeremiah,  died  in  Hospital.
Hospital  maintains  a  morgue  with  refrigerated  drawers  a  bit
larger than a human body. Jeremiah’s body was placed in such
a  drawer  awaiting  pickup  by  a  mortician.  Before  the
mortician called for the body, a Hospital orderly placed two
opaque plastic bags in the drawer with Jeremiah’s body. One
bag  contained  Jeremiah’s  personal  effects,  and  the  other
contained an amputated leg from some other Hospital patient.
It  is  stipulated  that  Hospital  was  negligent  to  allow  the
amputated  leg  to  get  into  Jeremiah’s  drawer.  The  mortician
delivered the two opaque plastic bags to John, assuming both
contained personal effects. John was shocked when he opened
the  bag  containing  the  amputated  leg.  John  sued  Hospital  to
recover for his emotional distress. At the trial, John testified
that the experience had been extremely upsetting, that he had
had  recurring  nightmares  about  it,  and  that  his  family  and
business  relationships  had  been  adversely  affected  for  a
period  of  several  months.  He  did  not  seek  medical  or
psychiatric treatment for his emotional distress.
Who should prevail?

720

(A)  John, because of the sensitivity people have regarding the

care of the bodies of deceased relatives.

(B)  John, because hospitals are strictly liable for mishandling

dead bodies.

(C)    Hospital,  because  John  did  not  require  medical  or

psychiatric treatment.

(D)  Hospital, because John suffered no bodily harm.
Answer  40:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Most  courts  allow
recovery  for  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress  when
there  has  been  a  negligent  mishandling  of  a  corpse.  The  fact
pattern indicates that the Hospital was negligent in its care of
the  body.  Where  the  facts  are  such  that  it  can  confidently  be
believed that there has been actual mental distress (i.e., where
mental distress would be the normal human reaction), courts
ignore the ban on recovery for purely mental harm in a claim
for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

(B)      is  wrong  because  it  misstates  the  law — neither
hospitals  nor  any  other  class  of  defendant  is  strictly
liable for mishandling dead bodies. What’s special about
they’re  negligently
that  when 
dead  bodies 
mishandled, a close relative of the body can recover for
emotional  distress  that’s  not  accompanied  by  bodily
harm (something that is not usually the case in negligence
actions).

is 

(C)      is  wrong  because,  in  the  case  of  a  claim  for  negligent
mishandling  of  a  corpse,  it  is  not  necessary  that  the
plaintiff  seek  treatment  for  his  distress.  Where  such
mishandling occurs, courts are confident in inferring that
a  close  relative  of  the  corpse  would  indeed  have
suffered actual mental distress from the mishandling.
(D)   is wrong because a claim for negligent mishandling of a
corpse is a situation where courts have allowed damages
for  pure  emotional  suffering  despite  the  fact  that  the
defendant has suffered no physical harm.

b.  The “at risk” plaintiff

i.  Where P suffers bodily harm

Question  41:  Palko  is  being  treated  by  a  physician  for
asbestosis,  an  abnormal  chest  condition  that  was  caused  by

721

his on-the-job handling of materials containing asbestos. His
physician  has  told  him  that  the  asbestosis  is  not  presently
cancerous,  but  that  it  considerably  increases  the  risk  that  he
will ultimately develop lung cancer.

Palko brought an action for damages, based on strict product
liability,  against  the  supplier  of  the  materials  that  contained
asbestos.  The  court  in  this  jurisdiction  has  ruled  against
recovery  of  damages  for  negligently  inflicted  emotional
distress in the absence of physical harm.

If  the  supplier  is  subject  to  liability  to  Palko  for  damages,
should  the  award  include  damage  for  emotional  distress  he
has suffered arising from his knowledge of the increased risk
that he will develop lung cancer?

(A)  No, because Palko’s emotional distress did not cause his

physical condition.

(B)  No, unless the court in this jurisdiction recognizes a cause

of action for an increased risk of cancer.

(C)    Yes,  because  the  supplier  of  a  dangerous  product  is

strictly liable for the harm it causes.

(D)    Yes,  because  Palko’s  emotional  distress  arises  from

bodily harm caused by his exposure to asbestos.

Answer  41:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Palko  is  an  at-risk
plaintiff,  one  who  by  virtue  of  his  exposure  to  a  particular
substance, has suffered an increased likelihood of a particular
disease.  Even  in  jurisdictions  disallowing  recovery  for  pure
emotional  distress  (unaccompanied  by  bodily  harm)  for
negligently-inflicted  harm  or  harm  caused  by  a  defective
product, a plaintiff may recover for emotional distress as an
“add on” if the plaintiff has also suffered bodily harm. That’s
true here — Palko’s asbestosis is bodily harm, so he can add
recovery  for  emotional  distress  due  to  the  increased  cancer
risk  on  top  of  it  to  his  recovery  from  the  already-existing
(though perhaps minor) bodily harm from asbestosis.
(A)      is  wrong  because,  in  a  suit  for  negligent  infliction  of
emotional  distress,  it  is  not  required  that  the  emotional
distress  be  the  cause  of  a  physical  condition;  it  is
possible  that  physical  harm  can  cause  compensable
emotional distress, as is the case here.

722

(B)   is wrong as a matter of law. If plaintiff had not already
suffered  bodily  harm  (the  abnormal  chest  condition
called asbestosis), this choice would be correct — many
courts  don’t  recognize  a  cause  of  action  for  “increased
risk of cancer” even against a tortfeasor who has brought
about that increased risk. But where plaintiff has already
been  injured — and  asbestosis  is  an  injury,  i.e.,  a  form
of  bodily  harm  regardless  of  whether  it  later  produces
cancer — virtually  all  courts  allow  the  injured  plaintiff
to “tack on” a recovery for emotional distress due to the
injury.  And  distress  at  the  knowledge  of  increased
cancer  risk  is  no  different,  for  this  purpose,  from  any
other distress.

(C)   is wrong because it misses the issue. True, a supplier of
a defectively dangerous product is strictly liable for the
“harm”  it  causes.  But  the  key  question  is,  what  is  the
harm that’s compensable? (D) is a better explanation of
why plaintiff will recover from harm that might seem to
be purely intangible.

II.   PURE ECONOMIC LOSS

A.  Traditional rule

1.  Rationale

Question 42:  Star,  who  played  the  lead  role  in  a  television
soap opera, was seriously injured in an automobile accident
caused  by  Danton’s  negligent  driving.  As  a  consequence  of
Star’s injury, the television series was canceled, and Penn, a
supporting actor, was laid off.
In an action against Danton, can Penn recover for his loss of
income attributable to the accident?

(A)  Yes, because Danton’s negligence was the cause in fact of

Penn’s loss.

(B)    Yes,  unless  Penn  failed  to  take  reasonable  measures  to

mitigate his loss.

(C)  No, unless Danton should have foreseen that by injuring

Star he would cause harm to Penn.

(D)    No,  because  Danton’s  liability  does  not  extend  to

723

economic  loss  to  Penn  that  arises  solely  from  physical
harm to Star.

Answer 42:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  The  general  rule  is  that
even if D negligently causes physical harm or property harm
to A, D will not be liable for pure economic harm to B, where
the  latter  harm  stems  from  the  harm  to  A.  There  is  an
exception  if  B  was  in  the  zone  of  physical  danger.  In  many
courts,  there  is  a  second  exception  if  B  watched  physical
harm  to  A,  at  least  where  B  and  A  are  close  relatives.  But
here,  neither  exception  applies.  So  the  default  rule  applies:
Since  Penn  was  never  placed  at  physical  risk,  and  didn’t
witness the physical risk or injury to Star, Penn can’t recover
for his pure economic loss. (The theory behind this principle
is  that  if  such  pure-economic-loss  recovery  were  allowed,
negligence  liability  would  extend  too  far,  and  lawsuit  costs
would go through the roof.)
(A)  and  (B)  are  wrong,  because  neither  recognizes  the  key
issue, which is discussed in (D).
(C)      is  wrong  because  it  cites  an  irrelevant  factor.  Even  if
Danton had been able to foresee that by injuring Star he
would  cause  harm  to  Penn,  Danton  would  still  not  be
liable,  because  the  harm  to  Penn  here  is  purely
economic. In other words, this choice, like (A) and (B),
fails  to  deal  with  the  key  issue,  liability  for  pure
economic harm.

724

CHAPTER 8
OWNERS AND OCCUPIERS OF LAND

I.    TRESPASSERS

A.  General rule

Question  43:  A  bright  nine-year-old  child  attended  a  day
care center after school. The day care center was located near
a  man-made  duck  pond  on  the  property  of  a  corporation.
During  the  winter,  the  pond  was  used  for  ice  skating  when
conditions were suitable. At a time when the pond was only
partially  frozen,  the  child  sneaked  away  from  the  center  and
walked out onto the ice covering the pond. The ice gave way,
and the child fell into the cold water. He suffered shock and
would have drowned had he not been rescued by a passerby.
At the time of the incident, the pond was clearly marked with
signs  that  stated,  “THIN  ICE — NO  SKATING.”  When  the
child  left  the  day  care  center,  the  center  was  staffed  with  a
reasonable  number  of  qualified  personnel,  and  the  center’s
employees were exercising reasonable care to ensure that the
children  in  their  charge  did  not  leave  the  premises.  The
jurisdiction follows a rule of pure comparative negligence.

In a suit brought on the child’s behalf against the corporation,
who is likely to prevail?

(A)   The child, because the corporation owes a duty to keep

its premises free of dangerous conditions.

(B)   The child, because the pond was an attractive nuisance.
(C)      The  corporation,  because  the  danger  of  thin  ice  may
reasonably be expected to be understood by a nine-year-
old child.

(D)   The corporation, because the day care center had a duty

to keep the child off the ice.

Answer  43:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  As  a  general  rule,  a
landowner owes no duty to a trespasser to make her land safe.
There  are  several  exceptions,  but  none  of  those  exceptions
applies here. The exception that comes closest to applying is
that  an  owner  may  have  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  a

725

trespassing  child,  if  the  owner  has  maintained  an  “attractive
nuisance.” But for reasons described in the analysis of Choice
(B) below, this exception does not apply here.

(A)   is wrong because the duty of a landowner to trespassers
to  keep  the  property  free  of  dangerous  artificial
conditions  exists  only  where  the  owner  has  reason  to
know  that  trespassers  are  in  dangerous  proximity  to  the
condition  and  that  they  are  unlikely  to  appreciate  the
risk.  Even  then,  the  duty  is  only  to  exercise  reasonable
care to warn trespassers of the danger, which was done
here.

(B)   is wrong because, while it is true that an owner may be
liable  to  a  trespasser  if  the  owner  has  maintained  an
“attractive  nuisance,”  the  condition  here  was  not  an
attractive  nuisance.  For  a  condition  on  land  to  be
considered  an  attractive  nuisance, 
there  must  be
evidence  that  the  possessor  had  reason  to  know  that
children were likely to trespass, as well as evidence that
the  plaintiff  did  not  appreciate  the  risk  involved.  No
such  evidence  is  mentioned  in  the  facts;  for  instance,
there  is  no  suggestion  that  children  often  stray  from  the
day  care  center,  and  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  the
child was not aware of the danger (since we’re told he
was  a  “bright  nine-year-old”  and  that  the  danger  was
well-marked).

(D)   is wrong because, while this answer correctly states that
the corporation will prevail, it misstates the legal basis
for  this  conclusion.  Even  if  the  day  care  center  had  a
duty to keep children from the ice, the corporation could
also  be  liable  if  it  was  negligent.  That  is,  if  A  is
negligent as to a risk, the fact that B was also negligent
as to the same risk is unlikely to save A from liability.

B.  Exceptions to general rule

1.  Discovered trespassers

Question  44:  Prad  entered  Drug  Store  to  make  some
purchases. As he was searching the aisles for various items,
he  noticed  a  display  card  containing  automatic  pencils.  The
display card was on a high shelf behind a cashier’s counter.

726

Prad  saw  a  sign  on  the  counter  that  read,  “No  Admittance,
Employees Only.” Seeing no clerks in the vicinity to help him,
Prad  went  behind  the  counter  to  get  a  pencil.  A  clerk  then
appeared  behind  the  counter  and  asked  whether  she  could
help  him.  He  said  he  just  wanted  a  pencil  and  that  he  could
reach the display card himself. The clerk said nothing further.
While  reaching  for  the  display  card,  Prad  stepped  sideways
into an open shaft and fell to the basement, ten feet below. The
clerk  knew  of  the  presence  of  the  open  shaft,  but  assumed
incorrectly that Prad had noticed it.

Prad sued Drug Store to recover damages for the injuries he
sustained  in  the  fall.  The  jurisdiction  has  adopted  a  rule  of
pure  comparative  negligence,  and  it  follows  traditional
common-law rules governing the duties of a land possessor.

Will Prad recover a judgment against Drug Store?

(A)  No, because Prad was a trespasser.
(B)    No,  unless  Prad’s  injuries  resulted  from  the  defendant’s

willful or wanton misconduct.

(C)  Yes, because the premises were defective with respect to

a public invitee.

(D)    Yes,  if  the  clerk  had  reason  to  believe  that  Prad  was

unaware of the open shaft.

Answer 44: Choice (D) is correct. Normally, a shopper in a
store  would  be  considered  an  invitee — a  member  of  the
public who comes onto land held open to him and who does
so  for  the  purpose  for  which  the  land  is  held  open.  Such
people  reasonably  expect  that  the  premises  have  been  made
safe for them. A visitor who is an invitee as to one part of the
premises may become a trespasser if he goes beyond the part
of  the  land  held  open  to  him.  When  Prad  went  behind  the
counter  despite  seeing  the  sign  “No  Admittance,  Employees
Only,” he might be found to have been a trespasser. But even
if that’s true, when the clerk saw him in that position, he was
a  “discovered  trespasser,”  and  as  such  the  store  had  an
obligation  to  warn  him  of  dangers  known  to  it  and  likely
unknown to Prad. Therefore, if the clerk had reason to believe
that  Prad  was  unaware  of  the  open  shaft  (and  given  that  the
facts tell us the clerk knew about the open shaft), Drug Store

727

will  be  liable  for  the  clerk’s  failure  to  warn  Prad  of  the
danger.

(A)      is  wrong  because  Prad  was  a  licensee  when  he  was
behind  the  cashier’s  counter,  as  explained  in  the
discussion of Choice D.

(B)      is  wrong  because  liability  arose  from  breach  of  the
owner’s  duty  to  warn  Prad  of  a  danger  that  it  should
reasonably anticipate that Prad may not discover. Willful
or wanton conduct is not required.

(C)   is wrong because this is not a claim for strict liability.
Premises are not “defective.” Liability arises here, if at
all,  from  negligence  principles,  not  from  strict  liability.
So  the  key  issue  is  whether  the  clerk  should  have
realized  that  Prad  didn’t  know  about  the  open  shaft  (as
discussed in (D)).

2.  Children

a.  Not usually the answer on the MBE

Question 45:  Davis  has  a  small  trampoline  in  his  backyard
which, as he knows, is commonly used by neighbor children
as  well  as  his  own.  The  trampoline  is  in  good  condition,  is
not defective in any way, and normally is surrounded by mats
to prevent injury if a user should fall off. Prior to leaving with
his family for the day, Davis leaned the trampoline up against
the side of the house and placed the mats in the garage.

While the Davis family was away, Philip, aged 11, a new boy
in the neighborhood, wandered into Davis’s yard and saw the
trampoline.  Philip  had  not  previously  been  aware  of  its
presence, but, having frequently used a trampoline before, he
decided to set it up, and started to jump. He lost his balance
on one jump and took a hard fall on the bare ground, suffering
a serious injury that would have been prevented by the mats.
An action has been brought against Davis on Philip’s behalf to
recover  damages  for  the  injuries  Philip  sustained  from  his
fall.  In  this  jurisdiction,  the  traditional  common-law  rules
pertaining to contributory negligence have been replaced by a
pure comparative negligence rule.
In his action against Davis, will Philip prevail?

728

(A)    No,  if  children  likely  to  be  attracted  by  the  trampoline
would normally realize the risk of using it without mats.
(B)    No,  if  Philip  failed  to  exercise  reasonable  care
commensurate with his age, intelligence, and experience.
(C)    No,  because  Philip  entered  Davis’s  yard  and  used  the

trampoline without Davis’s permission.

(D)    No,  because  Philip  did  not  know  about  the  trampoline
before  entering  Davis’s  yard  and  thus  was  not  “lured”
onto the premises.

Answer 45:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  A  trespassing  child  may
sue  for  harm  suffered  from  an  injurious  condition  on  the
defendant’s  land.  The  only  plausible  basis  for  Philip  to
recover  would  be  the  special  rule  under  which  a  landowner
will  be  liable  for  an  artificial  condition  that  is  highly
dangerous to trespassing children. The requirements set forth
in  Rest.  2d,  §  339  for  such  liability  are  that:  (1)  the  place
where the condition exists must be (as the owner knows) one
on  which  children  are  likely  to  trespass;  (2)  there  is,  as  the
owner knows, an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily
harm  to  such  children  from  the  condition;  (3)  the  children
because of their youth do not discover the condition or don’t
recognize  the  risk  from  it;  (4)  the  utility  of  maintaining  the
condition  is  slight  compared  with  the  risks  to  the  children
involved; and (5) the owner fails to exercise reasonable care.
Choice  (A)  correctly  addresses  requirement  (3),  that  the
child,  because  of  his  youth,  either  did  not  discover  the
condition or did not realize the danger posed by it.

(B)   is wrong because, if Philip failed to exercise reasonable
care,  this  would  merely  reduce  his  recovery,  but  not
block it altogether. The facts indicate that the traditional
common-law rules pertaining to contributory negligence
(which  would  block  recovery  by  a  negligent  plaintiff)
have  been  replaced  by  a  pure  comparative  negligence
rule  (where  the  plaintiff’s  recovery  is  reduced  by  a
proportion equal to the ratio between his own fault and
the total fault contributing to the accident). Therefore, if
Philip was negligent, his recovery would be reduced, but
not eliminated as this choice implies.

(C)   is wrong because a duty is owed to child trespassers as

729

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

long as certain requirements are met, as discussed in the
explanation of Choice (A).

(D)      is  wrong  because  most  modern  courts  reject  the
requirement that the child must have been attracted by the
particular  condition  which  ends  up  injuring  him  (the
“attractive nuisance” doctrine).

II.   LICENSEES

A.  Social guests

Question 46: At the trial of an action against Grandmother on
behalf of Patrick, the following evidence has been introduced.
Grandson  and  his  friend,  Patrick,  both  aged  eight,  were
visiting  at  Grandmother’s  house  when,  while  exploring  the
premises,  they  discovered  a  hunting  rifle  in  an  unlocked  gun
cabinet.  They  removed  it  from  the  cabinet  and  were
examining  it  when  the  rifle,  while  in  Grandson’s  hands,
somehow  discharged.  The  bullet  struck  and  injured  Patrick.
The  gun  cabinet  was  normally  locked.  Grandmother  had
opened it for dusting several days before the boys’ visit, and
had then forgotten to relock it. She was not aware that it was
unlocked when the boys arrived.

If  the  defendant  moves  for  a  directed  verdict  in  her  favor  at
the end of the plaintiff’s case, that motion should be

(A)  granted, because Grandmother is not legally responsible

for the acts of Grandson.

(B)  granted, because Grandmother did not recall that the gun

cabinet was unlocked.

(C)    denied,  because  a  firearm  is  an  inherently  dangerous

instrumentality.

(D)    denied,  because  a  jury  could  find  that  Grandmother

breached a duty of care she owed to Patrick.

Answer 46: Choice (D) is correct. Patrick was a licensee, a
person  who  has  the  owner’s  consent  to  be  on  the  owner’s
property, but who does not have a business purpose for being
there, or anything else entitling him to be there apart from the
owner’s  consent.  When  the  plaintiff  is  a  licensee,  the
defendant does not have a “duty to inspect” for dangers. But if

730

the  defendant  knows  of  a  dangerous  condition,  the  defendant
has  a  duty  to  take  reasonable  precautions  to  make  the
premises safe. In this case, a reasonable jury could find that
since  Grandmother  knew  of  the  danger  from  guns,  she  had  a
duty to take reasonable care to keep the cabinet locked.

from 

arising 

(A)   is wrong because, even though there may not be a special
duty 
the  Grandmother-Grandson
relationship, a duty did arise for Grandmother, as owner
of  the  premises  and  the  gun  cabinet,  to  use  reasonable
care in safeguarding the guns. She is therefore liable for
the foreseeable consequences of her breach of this duty
regardless  of  whether  it  was  Grandson  or  some  other
child who got his hand on the gun.

(B)   is wrong because if Grandma did not recall that the gun
is  evidence  of  her
cabinet  was  unlocked, 
unreasonable  behavior.  Reasonable  care  would  require
that  an  owner  of  a  gun  cabinet  be  extremely  vigilant  in
making  sure  that  the  cabinet  is  locked,  especially  when
there are young children exploring the premises.

this 

(C)   is wrong because it relies on an inappropriate concept.
The concept of an “inherently dangerous instrumentality”
might apply to strict product liability, or to strict liability
for  conducting  an  abnormally  dangerous  activity.  But  it
would  not  apply  to  a  negligence  suit.  In  other  words,
plaintiff can’t win unless defendant was negligent — it’s
not  enough  that  defendant  possessed  an  inherently
dangerous  instrumentality  (if,  indeed,  a  gun  is  such).
Also, guns can themselves be locked (trigger guards), so
the  factual  accuracy  of  this  choice  is  questionable  as
well.

III.  INVITEES

A.  Duty of due care

1.  Effect of warning

a.  Torts by third persons

Question 47: Supermarket is in a section of town where there
are  sometimes  street  fights  and  where  pedestrians  are

731

occasionally  the  victims  of  pickpockets  and  muggers.  In
recognition of the unusual number of robberies in the area, the
supermarket posted signs in the store and in its parking lot that
read:

                              Warning: There are pickpockets and muggers at work in this part of the city. Supermarket is not

responsible for the acts of criminals.

One  evening,  Lorner  drove  to  Supermarket  to  see  about  a
special  on  turkeys  that  Supermarket  was  advertising.  She
decided  that  the  turkeys  were  too  large  and  left  the  store
without  purchasing  anything.  In  the  parking  lot,  she  was
attacked  by  an  unknown  man  who  raped  her  and  then  ran
away.

If Lorner sues Supermarket, the result should be for the

(A)  plaintiff, if Supermarket failed to take reasonable steps to
protect  customers  against  criminal  attack  in  its  parking
lot.

(B)    plaintiff,  because  Supermarket  is  liable  for  harm  to

business invitees on its premises.

(C)    defendant,  if  the  warning  signs  were  plainly  visible  to

Lorner.

(D)  defendant, because the rapist was the proximate cause of

Lorner’s injuries.

Answer  47:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  Grocery  store  shoppers
are  invitees — members  of  the  public  who  come  onto  land
held  open  to  them  and  who  do  so  for  the  purpose  for  which
the land is held open. Such people reasonably expect that the
premises have been made safe for them, and the owner must
exercise  reasonable  care  for  the  safety  of  such  people.
Reasonable care by the owner will typically require that she
attempt  to  exercise  control  over  third  persons  on  the
premises.  A  storekeeper,  for  instance,  will  generally  be
required  to  take  reasonable  security  measures  to  prevent
attacks or thefts against her customers.
(B)   is wrong because Supermarket is liable for harm caused
to its invitee only if it has breached a duty of reasonable
care to that invitee. (B) asserts a blanket rule of liability,
and is therefore incorrect.

732

(C)   is wrong because Supermarket’s duty requires that it use
reasonable  efforts  to  control  third  persons  on  the
premises. Issuing a warning does not necessarily satisfy
this duty.

(D)      is  wrong  because  if  Supermarket  breached  its  duty  in
failing to protect Lorner against the rapist, it is liable for
injuries  inflicted  by  the  rapist  that  were  a  foreseeable
result of breach of that duty. Note that an event may have
multiple  proximate  causes;  so  here,  the  fact  that  the
rapist  was  a  proximate  cause  of  Lorner’s  injuries
doesn’t  prevent  Supermarket’s  negligence  (in  failing  to
use  adequate  security  measures)  from  also  being  a
proximate cause of those injuries.

733

CHAPTER 9
VICARIOUS LIABILITY

I.    EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP

A.  Torts by non-employees (e.g., guests and customers)

Question 48: Perkins and Morton were passengers sitting in
adjoining  seats  on  a  flight  on  Delval  Airline.  There  were
many empty seats on the aircraft.

During the flight, a flight attendant served Morton nine drinks.
As Morton became more and more obviously intoxicated and
attempted to engage Perkins in a conversation, Perkins chose
to ignore Morton. This angered Morton, who suddenly struck
Perkins in the face, giving her a black eye.
If Perkins asserts a claim for damages against Delval Airline
based on battery, she will

(A)    prevail,  because  she  suffered  an  intentionally  inflicted

harmful or offensive contact.

(B)    prevail,  if  the  flight  attendant  acted  recklessly  in

continuing to serve liquor to Morton.

(C)  not prevail, because Morton was not acting as an agent or

employee of Delval Airline.

(D)    not  prevail,  unless  she  can  establish  some  permanent

injury from the contact.

Answer 48: Choice (C) is correct. The doctrine of vicarious
liability  provides  that  in  some  special  relationships,  such  as
that  of  employer-employee,  the  tortious  act  of  an  employee
may be imputed to his employer. As a result, the latter will be
held  liable,  even  though  its  own  conduct  may  have  been
completely blameless. In order for Delval Airline to be liable
for the battery perpetrated by Morton, there would have to be
such a relationship between Morton and the airline. Since, as
(C)  correctly  recites,  Morton  was  not  acting  as  an  agent  or
employee of Delval, vicarious liability would not be applied.
(A)   is wrong because the fact that Perkins suffered a battery
by itself doesn’t justify imposing liability on Delval for

734

the battery.

(B)      is  wrong  because  the  airline  has  not  committed  battery
here.  Battery  is,  of  course,  an  intentional  tort,  so  the
airline can be liable for that intentional tort (as opposed
to liable in negligence) only if the airline or someone for
whom the airline is directly responsible had the requisite
intent  to  commit  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact.  Since
Morton  wasn’t  the  airline’s  agent  or  employee,  this
requirement  of  intent  isn’t  satisfied.  The  fact  that  the
airline  may  have  been  reckless  in  facilitating  Morton’s
intentional  tort  won’t  be  enough,  because  a  reckless
mental  state  on  the  part  of  the  airline  won’t  suffice  for
battery.  (Whereas  a  business  owner  can  be  liable  in
negligence  for  failing  to  stop  someone  else’s  negligent
or  intentional  tort,  there’s  no  comparable  principle
whereby a business owner becomes liable for intentional
tort  X  merely  for  recklessly  bringing  about  a  third
person’s commission of X.)

(D)   is wrong the because severity of the injury is irrelevant
in  determining  Delval’s  liability  for  the  conduct  of
another.

CHAPTER 10
STRICT LIABILITY

I.    ABNORMALLY DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES

A.  Examples

1.  Nuclear reactor

Question 49:  As  a  result  of  an  accident  at  the  NPP  nuclear
power plant, a quantity of radioactive vapor escaped from the
facility  and  two  members  of  the  public  were  exposed  to
excessive doses of radiation. According to qualified medical
opinion,  that  exposure  will  double  the  chance  that  these  two
persons will ultimately develop cancer. However, any cancer
that  might  be  caused  by  this  exposure  will  not  be  detectable
for at least ten years. If the two exposed persons do develop
cancer,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  determine  whether  it  was
caused  by  this  exposure  or  would  have  developed  in  any
event.
If  the  exposed  persons  assert  a  claim  for  damages  against
NPP  shortly  after  the  escape  of  the  radiation,  which  of  the
following questions will NOT present a substantial issue?
(A)  Will the court recognize that the plaintiffs have suffered a

present legal injury?

(B)  Can the plaintiffs prove the amount of their damages?
(C)  Can the plaintiffs prove that any harm they may suffer was

caused by this exposure?

(D)  Can the plaintiffs prevail without presenting evidence of

specific negligence on the part of NPP?

Answer  49:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  Operation  of  a  nuclear
power plant is an ultrahazardous activity. Therefore, NPP can
be  strictly  liable  for  the  accident  without  any  proof  by  the
exposed plaintiff that NPP behaved negligently.
(A)   is incorrect because the question of whether doubling the
risk  of  contracting  cancer  ten  years  into  the  future
the
issue, 
presents  a  substantial 
plaintiff’s  have  already  suffered  a  present  compensable

is,  whether 

that 

736

legal injury.

(B)      is  incorrect  because  valuing  the  damages  suffered  by  a
plaintiff who is now healthy but is at an increased risk of
contracting a deadly disease, raises the substantial issue
of whether the damages are too speculative to calculate
at the present time.

(C)   is incorrect because causation is a real issue in the case.
Plaintiffs ordinarily have the burden of proving harm. At
present  they  have  not  contracted  cancer  and  have
suffered no present harm. So it’s a real issue whether any
cancer  they  suffer  in  the  future  (the  “present  value”  of
which  they’re  trying  to  recover  now)  will  have  been
caused by the radiation exposure.

2.  Construction activities

Question 50:  Innes  worked  as  a  secretary  in  an  office  in  a
building occupied partly by her employer and partly by Glass,
a  retail  store.  The  two  areas  were  separated  by  walls  and
were  in  no  way  connected,  except  that  the  air  conditioning
unit  served  both  areas  and  there  was  a  common  return-air
duct.
Glass  began  remodeling,  and  its  employees  did  the  work,
which  included  affixing  a  plastic  surfacing  material  to
counters. To fasten the plastic to the counters, the employees
purchased  glue,  with  the  brand  name  Stick,  that  was
manufactured  by  Steel,  packaged  in  a  sealed  container  by
Steel, and retailed by Paint Company.

In the course of the remodeling job, one of Glass’s employees
turned on the air conditioning and caused fumes from the glue
to travel from Glass through the air conditioning unit and into
Innes’s  office.  The  employees  did  not  know  that  there  was
common  ductwork  for  the  air  conditioners.  Innes  was
permanently blinded by the fumes from the glue.
The  label  on  the  container  of  glue  read,  “DANGER.  Do  not
smoke  near  this  product.  Extremely  flammable.  Contains
Butanone, Tuluol and Hexane. Use with adequate ventilation.
Keep out of the reach of children.”
The  three  chemicals  listed  on  the  label  are  very  toxic  and
harmful to human eyes. Steel had received no reports of eye

737

injuries  during  the  ten  years  that  the  product  had  been
manufactured and sold.

If Innes asserts a claim against Glass, the most likely result is
that she will

(A)  recover, because a user of a product is held to the same

standard as the manufacturer.

(B)    recover,  because  the  employees  of  Glass  caused  the

fumes to enter her area of the building.

(C)  not recover, because Glass used the glue for its intended

purposes.

(D)    not  recover,  because  the  employees  of  Glass  had  no

reason to know that the fumes could injure Innes.

Answer 50: Choice (D) is correct. What we care about here
is  whether  Glass  is  strictly  liable  for  having  carried  out  an
abnormally dangerous activity. The answer is, “no.” It’s very
unlikely  the  use  of  the  glue  here  would  be  considered
ultrahazardous,  as  you  can  see  by  considering  the  four
elements  that  generally  make  an  activity  ultrahazardous:  (1)
the activity involves a high risk of serious harm, (2) there’s no
way to perform the activity completely safely no matter how
much care is taken, (3) the activity is not commonly engaged
in  in  the  particular  community,  and  (4)  the  danger  of  the
activity  outweighs  its  utility  to  the  community.  At  least
element  (2)  is  missing  (it’s  possible  to  do  glueing  safely  by
venting  the  glue  fumes  to  the  outside),  and  it’s  doubtful
whether element (3) is satisfied either (since remodeling with
glue occurs all the time, even if this particular glue brand is
not widely used). So the activity isn’t ultrahazardous.

Nor  were  Glass’s  employees  negligent — it’s  clear  from  the
facts  that  they  did  not  know  about  the  danger  that  the  fumes
would  be  vented  over  to  Innes,  so  there’s  no  indication  of
negligence  on  their  part.  And  Glass  has  no  strict  product
liability,  because  as  is  further  discussed  in  (A)  below,  only
“sellers”  or  makers  of  defective  products,  not  users,  have
such liability.
(A)   is incorrect because it states incorrect law. It is not true
that  a  user  of  a  product  is  held  to  the  same  standard  as
the  manufacturer.  That’s  because  a  manufacturer  is

738

strictly liable for selling a defective product, whereas a
user is not. (Even if the use occurs in a business context,
and  even  if  the  use  directly  injures  a  third  person
because  the  product  being  used  is  “defective”  and
dangerous, the user will be liable only for negligence.)

liable.  Unless  either 

(B)      is  incorrect  because  even  if  the  employees  of  Glass
caused the fumes, this does not automatically make Glass
strictly 
the  activity  was
ultrahazardous,  or  Glass’s  employees  were  negligent,
Glass  would  not  be  liable  even  though  the  employees
caused the fumes to enter plaintiff’s area of the building.
(C)      is  incorrect  because  there  could  be  an  instance  where
using  a  product  for  its  intended  purposes  still  creates
liability. For instance, if Glass’s use of the product was
indeed  ultrahazardous,  as  discussed  in  the  explanation
for (D), Glass could have been liable.

B.  Requirement that D “carry out” the activity

1.  Use of independent contractor

Question  51:  Landco  purchased  a  large  tract  of  land
intending to construct residential housing on it. Landco hired
Poolco to build a large in-ground swimming pool on the tract.
The  contract  provided  that  Poolco  would  carry  out  blasting
operations that were necessary to create an excavation large
enough for the pool. The blasting caused cracks to form in the
residential
walls  of  Plaintiff’s  home 
neighborhood.

in  a  nearby 

In  Plaintiff’s  action  for  damages  against  Landco,  Plaintiff
should

(A)    prevail,  only  if  Landco  retained  the  right  to  direct  and

control Poolco’s construction of the pool.

(B)    prevail,  because  the  blasting  that  Poolco  was  hired  to

perform damaged Plaintiff’s home.

(C)  not prevail, if Poolco used reasonable care in conducting

the blasting operations.

(D)    not  prevail,  if  Landco  used  reasonable  care  to  hire  a

competent contractor.

Answer 51: Choice (B) is correct. Blasting is considered an

739

ultrahazardous  activity,  giving  rise  to  strict  liability.  Where
one  person  hires  an  independent  contractor  to  perform  an
untrahazardous activity, the hirer is strictly liable, just as the
contractor  is,  even  if  the  hirer  used  all  due  care  selecting  a
careful contractor.

(A)      is  wrong  because  Landco  is  responsible  for  damages
caused by Poolco regardless of whether or not Poolco is
Landco’s  employee.  The  doctrine  of  vicarious  liability
provides that in some special relationships, such as that
of  employer-employee,  the  tortious  act  of  an  employee
may  be  imputed  to  his  employer.  As  a  result,  the  latter
will  be  held  liable,  even  though  its  own  conduct  may
have  been  completely  blameless.  An  employee  is  one
who works subject to the control of the person who has
hired  him.  If  the  party  that  caused  the  damage  is  not  an
employee,  but  an  independent  contractor,  there  will
generally not be vicarious liability. However, there is an
exception — where the work is such that, unless special
precautions  are  taken,  there  will  be  a  high  degree  of
danger  to  others.  Rest.  2d,  §§  416,  427.  That’s  clearly
true  of  blasting  in  a  residential  neighborhood  (which  is
an  “ultrahazardous  activity”  for  which  the  person
carrying it out has strict liability). Therefore, Landco, the
hiring  party,  will  be  liable  for  the  damage  caused  by
Poolco,  despite  the  fact  that  Poolco  is  an  independent
contractor,  and  even  if  Landco  didn’t  retain  the  right  to
direct and control Poolco’s work.

(C)   is wrong because the use of reasonable care is irrelevant
in  a  claim  for  strict  liability  for  an  ultrahazardous
activity, as this is. (See the discussion of Choice (A) for
more about this.)

(D)      is  wrong  because,  as  the  hiring  party,  Landco  will  be
vicariously  liable  for  harm  caused  by  Poolco  based  on
the  abnormal  dangerousness  of  the  activity  in  which
Poolco was engaging. See the more extensive discussion
of why this is so, in the treatment of Choice (A).

CHAPTER 11
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

I.    NEGLIGENCE

A.  Classes of defendants

1.  Manufacturers

Question 52: A bicycle company manufactured a bicycle that
it  sold  to  a  retail  bicycle  dealer,  which  in  turn  sold  it  to  a
cyclist.  Shortly  thereafter,  while  the  cyclist  was  riding  the
bicycle  along  a  city  street,  he  saw  a  traffic  light  facing  him
turn  from  green  to  amber.  He  sped  up,  hoping  to  cross  the
intersection before the light turned red. However, the cyclist
quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brake,
which  failed.  To  avoid  the  traffic  that  was  then  crossing  in
front of him, the cyclist turned sharply to his right and onto the
sidewalk,  where  he  struck  a  pedestrian.  Both  the  pedestrian
and  the  cyclist  sustained  injuries.  The  jurisdiction  has
retained common-law joint-and-several liability.
If the pedestrian asserts a claim based on negligence against
the  bicycle  company  and  it  is  found  that  the  brake  failure
resulted  from  a  manufacturing  defect  in  the  bicycle,  will  the
pedestrian prevail?

(A)    Yes,  because  the  bicycle  company  placed  a  defective

bicycle into the stream of commerce.

(B)  Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the
exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.
(C)    No,  because  the  pedestrian  was  not  a  purchaser  of  the

bicycle.

(D)    No,  if  the  cyclist  was  negligent  in  turning  onto  the

sidewalk.

Answer 52: The correct choice is (B). As in any negligence
claim,  a  defendant  will  be  liable  for  product  liability  based
on  negligence  if  (1)  he  failed  to  exercise  such  care  as  a
reasonable  person  in  his  position  would  have  exercised;  (2)
this was a breach of the duty to prevent the foreseeable risk of
injury to anyone in the plaintiff’s position, and (3) this breach

741

must  have  caused  the  plaintiff’s  damages.  There  are  four
principal ways in which a manufacturer can be negligent: (1)
manufacturing  flaw,  (2)  negligent  failure  to  inspect,  (3)
negligent design, and (4) failure to warn.

Choice B is directed at scenario (2): If the bicycle company,
using  reasonable  care  in  the  inspection  process,  would  have
discovered  the  defect,  then  its  not  discovering  it  was
negligent.  This  would  satisfy  the  ‘‘breach’’  element  of
negligence,  and  the  other  three  elements — duty,  causation,
and  damages — are  not  at  issue  here.  Finally,  if  the  bicycle
company was negligent, it’ll be liable to the pedestrian, since
it is reasonably foreseeable that if a cyclist’s brakes fail, he
will hit a pedestrian.

(A)  is  wrong,  because  the  element  it  states  would  be
irrelevant  in  a  product  liability  claim  based  on  negligence,
and it ignores an element negligence requires: fault. As in any
negligence claim, a product liability suit based on negligence
requires,  among  other  things,  that  the  defendant  failed  to
exercise  such  care  as  a  reasonable  person  in  his  position
would  have  exercised.  The  mere  fact  that  the  bicycle  was
defective  would  not  be  sufficient  to  establish  negligence  by
the  bicycle  company,  since  the  defect  might  have  occurred
despite the company’s total carefulness in design, manufacture
and inspection.

If  you  chose  this  response,  you  were  probably  thinking  of  a
product  liability  claim  based  on  strict  liability.  Under  that
theory,  a  defendant  will  be  liable  if  the  product  was
defectively dangerous when it left his control (in the parlance
of Choice A, when the product was ‘‘placed in the stream of
commerce’’). However, you’re told here that the basis of the
claim is negligence.
(C) is wrong, because the pedestrian needn’t be a purchaser
in  order  to  prevail.  Choice  C  suggests  that  the  pedestrian
should lose because, as a non-purchaser, he lacks privity with
the bicycle company. This is not the actual rule for a product
liability suit based on negligence; in fact, the defendant’s duty
extends to anyone foreseeably endangered by the product. The
scope  of  the  risk  posed  by  failing  bicycle  brakes  includes
injury  to  bystanders  whom  the  rider  tries  to  avoid  but  can’t

742

because  of  the  failure.  Thus,  as  long  as  the  pedestrian  can
prove  that  the  bicycle  company  was  negligent  and  this
proximately caused his damages, he’ll prevail.

(D) is wrong, because even if the cyclist was negligent, this
will not prevent the pedestrian from recovering. This choice
suggests  that  if  the  cyclist’s  turning  onto  the  sidewalk  was
negligent, this negligence will constitute a supervening cause,
breaking  the  chain  of  causation  from  the  bicycle  company  to
the  pedestrian.  Even  in  the  unlikely  case  that  the  cyclist’s
conduct  was  considered  unreasonable, 
this  negligence
wouldn’t  exonerate 
the  bicycle  company.  A  negligent
tortfeasor will only be relieved of liability due to intervening
forces  if  those  forces  were  extremely  hard  to  foresee  at  the
time of the defendant’s negligent conduct (here, the negligent
manufacture  of  the  bike).  Where  a  bicycle’s  brakes  fail,  it’s
perfectly  foreseeable  that  the  failure  might  combine  with
negligent riding by the cyclist, so as to cause an accident with
a bystander, so the negligent riding (even if it occurred) won’t
be  a  superseding  event.  Nor  will  the  cyclist’s  negligence
reduce  the  pedestrian’s  recovery  from  the  bicycle  company 
the  pedestrian  can
liability  means 
— joint-and-several 
recover the full amount of his damages from any co-tortfeasor;
it would be up to the bicycle company to recover contribution
(a  sharing  of  the  damages,  in  proportion  to  fault)  from  the
cyclist.

2. Retailers

a.  Consequence

Question  53:  Parents  purchased  a  new  mobile  home  from
Seller.  The  mobile  home  was  manufactured  by  Mobilco  and
had  a  ventilating  system  designed  by  Mobilco  with  both  a
heating  unit  and  an  air  conditioner.  Mobilco  installed  a
furnace  manufactured  by  Heatco  and  an  air  conditioning  unit
manufactured  by  Coolco.  Each  was  controlled  by  an
independent thermostat installed by Mobilco. Because of the
manner in which Mobilco designed the ventilating system, the
first time the ventilating system was operated by Parents, cold
air was vented into Parents’ bedroom to keep the temperature
at 68°F. The cold air then activated the heater thermostat, and
hot air was pumped into the bedroom of Child, the six-month-

743

old child of Parents. The temperature in Child’s room reached
more than 170°F before Child’s mother became aware of the
condition and shut the system off manually. As a result, Child
suffered permanent physical injury.

Child, through a duly appointed guardian, has asserted a claim
against Seller based solely on negligence. The minimum proof
necessary to establish Seller’s liability is that the ventilating
system

(A)  was defective.
(B)  was defective and had not been inspected by Seller.
(C)  was defective and had been inspected by Seller, and the

defect was not discovered.

(D)    was  defective,  and  the  defect  would  have  been
discovered  if  Seller  had  exercised  reasonable  care  in
inspecting the system.

Answer 53: Choice (D) is correct. As a retailer, Seller will
only  be  liable  in  negligence  due  to  its  own  affirmative
negligence. Retailers only have a duty to inspect if they have
reason  to  believe  the  product  is  likely  to  be  defective,  and
even if they do have a duty to inspect, they’ll only be liable if
an  inspection  undertaken  with  reasonable  care  would  have
uncovered the defect. This choice mirrors these requirements
by  comparing  Seller’s  conduct  to  what  a  retailer  in  the
exercise of due care would have done.

(A)   is wrong because, as a retailer defending a negligence
action,  Seller  will  only  be  liable  for  negligence  due  to
its  own  affirmative  negligence.  So  the  fact  that  the
product was defective isn’t close to enough. If you chose
this  response,  you  were  probably  thinking  of  strict
product liability, under which proof of the defect would
be  the  lynchpin  of  Child’s  claim.  However,  you’re  told
the  suit  has  been  brought  only  in  negligence,  and
negligence  requires  some  proof  of  lack  of  due  care  on
defendant’s part.

(B)      is  wrong  because  it,  like  Choice  (A),  understates  the
proof  Child’s  negligence  claim  will  require.  Since  the
action is based solely on negligence, Seller will only be
liable  due  to  its  own  affirmative  negligence.  Retailers

744

only have a duty to inspect if they have reason to believe
the product is likely to be defective, and even if they do
have  a  duty  to  inspect,  they’ll  only  be  liable  if  an
inspection undertaken with reasonable care would have
uncovered the defect. Thus, merely proving a defect and
a  lack  of  inspection  would  be  insufficient  to  pin
negligence liability on Seller — Child would also have
to  prove  that  a  reasonable  inspection  would  have
uncovered the defect.

(C)      is  wrong  because  it,  too,  understates  the  proof  Child’s
negligence claim will require. Child must show both that
(1)  Seller  failed  to  follow  the  reasonable  standard  of
care  of  a  retailer,  and  (2)  this  failure  proximately  and
actually  caused  the  accident.  Seller’s  mere  failure  to
discover  the  defect  during  an  inspection  that  actually
occurred  would  not  make  Seller  negligent  unless  a
reasonable  inspection  would  have  uncovered  the  defect
(since  without  the  latter  showing,  Seller’s  failure  to
inspect  in  a  reasonable  manner  didn’t  change  the
outcome,  and  thus  wasn’t  the  proximate  cause  of  the
accident).

II.   WARRANTY

A.  Express warranties

1.  UCC

Question  54:  At  a  country  auction,  Powell  acquired  an
antique  cabinet  that  he  recognized  as  a  “Morenci,”  an
extremely  rare  and  valuable  collector’s  item.  Unfortunately,
Powell’s cabinet had several coats of varnish and paint over
the original finish. Its potential value could only be realized if
these layers could be removed without damaging the original
finish. Much of the value of Morenci furniture depends on the
condition of a unique oil finish, the secret of which died with
Morenci, its inventor.
A professional restorer of antique furniture recommended that
Powell use Restorall to remove the paint and varnish from the
cabinet. Powell obtained and read a sales brochure published
by  Restorall,  Inc.,  which  contained  the  following  statement:

745

“This  product  will  renew  all  antique  furniture.  Will  not
damage original oil finishes.”

Powell purchased some Restorall and used it on his cabinet,
being  very  careful  to  follow  the  accompanying  instructions
exactly.  Despite  Powell’s  care,  the  original  Morenci  finish
was  irreparably  damaged.  When  finally  refinished,  the
cabinet was worth less than 20% of what it would have been
worth if the Morenci finish had been preserved.

If  Powell  sues  Restorall,  Inc.,  to  recover  the  loss  he  has
suffered  as  a  result  of  the  destruction  of  the  Morenci  finish,
will Powell prevail?

(A)    Yes,  unless  no  other  known  removal  technique  would

have preserved the Morenci finish.

(B)  Yes, if the loss would not have occurred had the statement

in the brochure been true.

(C)    No,  unless  the  product  was  defective  when  sold  by

Restorall, Inc.

(D)  No, if the product was not dangerous to persons.
Answer  54:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  A  seller  may  expressly
represent  that  her  goods  have  certain  qualities.  If  the  goods
turn out not to have these qualities, the purchaser may sue for
breach of warranty. UCC Sec. 2-313. Had the statement “will
not  damage  original  oil  finishes”  been  true,  then  the  loss
suffered would not have occurred. In this case, the product is
not defective or dangerous to people (it only causes harm to a
particular  type  of  furniture).  Therefore,  a  warranty  claim  is
suitable for this kind of case.

(A)      is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  no  other  product  would
have  been  safer  for  use  on  the  furniture  is  irrelevant
when  the  claim  is  based  on  breach  of  an  express
warranty, i.e., a warranty stating that the product works
on all antique furniture and will not damage original oil
finishes. This answer sounds like it’s trying to conjure up
a  design  defect  claim,  where  it  is  relevant  that  the
adoption of a reasonable alternative design is available
or  not.  However,  the  availability  of  such  a  reasonable
alternative design is irrelevant here, given the warranty
claim.

746

(C)      is  wrong  because  suit  for  breach  of  warranty  does  not

require that the product be “defective.”

(D)      is  wrong  because  the  fact  that  the  product  is  not
dangerous to people is irrelevant in this case of breach
of warranty.

III.  STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY

A.  Retailers and other non-manufacturers

1.  MBE tip on retailers

a.  Retailer’s fate linked to manufacturer’s fate

Question 55:  A  secretary  worked  in  an  office  in  a  building
occupied partly by her employer and partly by a retail glass
store. The two areas were separated by walls and were in no
way  connected,  except  that  the  air  conditioning  unit  served
both areas and there was a common return-air duct.

The glass store began remodeling, and its employees did the
work, which included affixing a plastic surfacing material to
counters. To fasten the plastic to the counters, the employees
purchased  glue,  with  the  brand  name  Stick,  that  was
manufactured  by  a  glue  manufacturer,  packaged  in  a  sealed
container  by  that  glue  manufacturer,  and  retailed  to  the  glass
store by a paint company.

In  the  course  of  the  remodeling  job,  one  of  the  glass  store’s
employees  turned  on  the  air  conditioning  and  caused  fumes
from  the  glue  to  travel  from  the  glass  store  through  the  air
conditioning  unit  and  into  the  secretary’s  office.  The  glass
store  employees  did  not  know  that  there  was  common
ductwork  for  the  air  conditioners.  The  secretary  was
permanently blinded by the fumes from the glue.

The label on the container of Stick glue read, “DANGER. Do
not  smoke  near  this  product.  Extremely  flammable.  Contains
Butanone, Tuluol, and Hexane. Use with adequate ventilation.
Keep out of the reach of children.”
The  three  chemicals  listed  on  the  label  are  very  toxic  and
harmful  to  human  eyes.  The  glue  manufacturer  had  received
no reports of eye injuries during the ten years that the product

747

had been manufactured and sold.

If the secretary asserts a claim against the paint company, the
most likely result is that she will

(A)  recover, if she can recover against the glue manufacturer.
(B)  recover, because the secretary was an invitee of a tenant

in the building.

(C)  not recover unless the paint company was negligent.
(D)  not recover, because the glue came in a sealed package.
Answer  55:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  This  choice  is  correct
because: (1) it correctly implies that the only basis on which
the  glue  manufacturer  could  be  liable  is  on  a  strict  product
liability  theory;  and  (2)  it  correctly  asserts  that  if  the  glue
manufacturer is strictly liable, then the paint company must be
as  well.  Let’s  take  these  steps  one  at  a  time.  As  to  (1),  the
glue  manufacturer  won’t  be  found  negligent,  since  it  had  no
reason  to  believe  that  the  product  posed  eye  dangers,  and
since it warned of any danger (e.g., from lack of ventilation)
of  which  it  was  aware.  So  if  the  glue  manufacturer  were
liable, it would have to be on a strict product liability basis.
As  to  (2),  if  the  glue  manufacturer  were  strictly  liable,  it
would  have  to  be  because  it  sold  a  defectively  dangerous
product.  If  the  product  was  defectively  dangerous,  then  the
paint  company,  as  a  “downstream”  re-seller,  would  have
exactly  the  same  liability,  since  anyone  who  sells  a
defectively  dangerous  product  is  strictly  liable  for  it.  So
there’s no way the glue manufacturer could be liable without
the paint company’s also being liable.

(B) is wrong because it doesn’t matter whether the secretary
was an invitee of a tenant in the building or not. The recovery
here would have to be on a strict product liability basis (see
the  analysis  of  Choice  (A)  for  why),  and  any  person  who  is
injured by a defect in a defective product can recover against
any seller of that product, whether the plaintiff was an invitee
at the time of the injury or not. (Indeed, even if the secretary
had  been  a  trespasser,  she  could  have  recovered  against  the
paint company in strict product liability.)
(C) is wrong because it ignores the possibility that the paint
company  is  strictly  liable  as  a  non-negligent  seller  of  a

748

dangerously defective product.

(D) is wrong because it ignores the possibility that the paint
company as a seller of a dangerously defective product would
be  strictly  liable  even  though  the  product  came  in  a  sealed
package.  Sellers  of  dangerously  defective  products  are
strictly  liable  for  the  harm  caused  by  the  defect,  and  that  is
true even though the seller behaved with all possible care. So
the  fact  that  the  product  came  in  a  sealed  package — thus
preventing the paint company from recognizing or altering the
danger  even  if  it  wanted  to — is  irrelevant  to  its  strict
liability.

B.  Bystanders and other non-user plaintiffs

Question  56:  In  preparation  for  a  mountain-climbing
the  necessary  climbing
expedition,  Alper  purchased 
equipment  from  Outfitters,  Inc.,  a  retail  dealer  in  sporting
goods.  A  week  later,  Alper  fell  from  a  rock  face  when  a
safety device he had purchased from Outfitters malfunctioned
because  of  a  defect  in  its  manufacture.  Thereafter,  Rollins
was  severely  injured  when  he  tried  to  reach  and  give
assistance  to  Alper  on  the  ledge  to  which  Alper  had  fallen.
Rollins’s injury was not caused by any fault on his own part.

If Rollins brings an action against Outfitters, Inc., to recover
damages for his injuries, will Rollins prevail?

(A)  No, unless Outfitters could have discovered the defect by

a reasonable inspection of the safety device.

(B)  No, because Rollins did not rely on the representation of
safety  implied  from  the  sale  of  the  safety  device  by
Outfitters.

(C)    Yes,  unless  Alper  was  negligent  in  failing  to  test  the

safety device.

(D)  Yes, because injury to a person in Rollins’s position was

foreseeable if the safety device failed.

Answer 56:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  This  is  a  strict  liability
claim for a manufacturing defect, i.e., a scenario in which the
product  has  departed  from  its  intended  design  in  a  way  that
makes  it  unsafe.  It  must  be  proven  that  (1)  the  product  was
defective, (2) at the time it left the defendant’s hands, and (3)
the  product  caused  harm.  The  causation  element  will  be

749

satisfied  in  this  case  if  it  was  foreseeable  that  the  failure  of
the safety device would invite rescue by a third party (and if
the rescue was not performed in a grossly careless manner).

(A)      is  wrong  because  the  retailer  will  be  subject  to  strict
product liability; and, therefore the reasonableness of his
conduct is irrelevant.

(B)   is wrong because reliance is irrelevant here. One who is
in the business of selling a product which turns out to be
dangerously  defective  has  strict  product  liability,  and
that’s  true  whether  the  retailer  made  any  implied  or
express representation of safety (and whether or not the
buyer relied on such a representation if one was made).

(C)      is  wrong  because,  in  the  ordinary  case,  the  product
user’s  failure  to  discover  the  defect  will  not  be
considered negligence. And even if the user’s failure to
discover the defect was negligence (which it isn’t), that
negligence  would  only  reduce  the  plaintiff’s  recovery,
not  eliminate  it.  (The  choice  asks  you  whether  plaintiff
would  “prevail,”  and  a  recovery  reduced  by  plaintiff’s
percentage of fault would still constitute “prevailing” in
everyday usage.)

IV.  DESIGN DEFECTS

A.  Negligence predominates

1.  Reasonable alternative design

Question 57: A 16-year-old student purchased an educational
chemistry set made by a manufacturer. The student invited his
classmate to assist him in a chemistry project. Referring to a
library  chemistry  book  on  explosives  and  finding  that  the
chemistry  set  contained  all  of  the  necessary  chemicals,  the
student and the classmate agreed to make a bomb. During the
course of the project, the student carelessly knocked a lighted
Bunsen  burner  into  a  bowl  of  chemicals  from  the  chemistry
set. The chemicals burst into flames, injuring the classmate.
In a suit by the classmate against the manufacturer, based on
strict liability, the classmate will
(A)  prevail, if the chemistry set did not contain a warning that

750

its  contents  could  be  combined  to  form  dangerous
explosives.

(B)    prevail,  because  manufacturers  of  chemistry  sets  are

engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.

(C)    not  prevail,  because  the  student’s  negligence  was  the

cause in fact of the classmate’s injury.

(D)  not prevail, if the chemistry set was as safe as possible,
consistent with its educational purposes, and its benefits
exceeded its risks.

Answer 57: Choice (D) is correct. Products that conform to
their  design,  and  essentially  do  what  the  consumer  expects
them to do, yet are by their very nature inherently dangerous,
are products that are “unavoidably unsafe.” The chemistry set
is  such  a  product.  The  question  to  be  determined  is  whether
such  an  unavoidably-unsafe  product  is  “reasonably  safe”
(because if it isn’t, it gives rise to strict products liability, and
if  it  is,  it  doesn’t  trigger  such  liability).  The  Third
Restatement applies a risk-utility approach to such products,
finding them defective rather than reasonably safe “when the
foreseeable  risks  of  harm  posed  by  the  product  could  have
been  reduced  or  avoided  by  the  adoption  of  a  reasonable
alternative  design  by  the  seller  .  .  .  and  the  omission  of  the
alternative  design  renders  the  product  not  reasonably  safe.”
Rest. 3d (Prod. Liab.) § 2(b). (D) essentially applies this test.
That  is,  the  choice  turns  on  whether  the  set  was  as  safe  as
possible  and  its  benefits  exceeded  its  risks;  if  it  was,  the
choice correctly asserts that the classmate would not prevail.

(A)   is wrong because the outcome would not turn on whether
such a warning was given. The presence or absence of a
warning  will  only  determine  the  outcome  of  a  product-
liability  case  if  the  warning  would  have  altered  the
outcome.  Here,  even  if  there  had  been  a  warning,  this
would probably not have prevented the knocking over of
the  Bunsen  burner.  (Would  the  student  have  been  less
likely to knock over the burner if there had been such a
warning and he had read it? Probably not.)

(B)   is wrong because when a person manufactures and sells
a dangerous product that causes injury post-sale, the act
of manufacturing and selling it won’t be deemed to be an

751

abnormally  dangerous  activity.  If  the  explosion  had
occurred  during  manufacture, 
that  probably  would
qualify  for  the  abnormally-dangerous-activity  form  of
strict  liability  (also  known  as  strict  liability  for
“ultrahazardous”  activities).  But  post-manufacture  and
post-sale, the relevant doctrine is strict product liability.
(C)      is  wrong  because  it  falsely  suggests  that  the  student’s
negligence would bar the manufacturer’s liability to the
classmate.  There  can  be  multiple  causes  in  fact,  and  if
the chemistry set had been defectively designed (which it
wasn’t), that defect could (and likely would) have been a
cause in fact, just as the student’s negligence would also
have  been.  In  that  scenario,  the  student’s  negligence
wouldn’t  even  have  caused  the  classmate’s  recovery
let  alone
from 
eliminated,  because  the  student’s  negligence  wouldn’t
have been imputed to the classmate.

2.  Component makers

Question  58:  A  married  couple  purchased  a  new  mobile
home  from  a  retailer  of  such  homes.  The  mobile  home  was
assembled  by  a  manufacturer  and  had  an  “HVAC”  (heating,
ventilating,  and  air  conditioning)  system  designed  by  that
manufacturer. The HVAC system contained both a furnace and
an  air  conditioner,  neither  of  which  was  made  by  the
manufacturer — the furnace was made by a heating company
and the air conditioner was made by a cooling company. The
manufacturer  selected  and  installed  the  furnace  and  the  air
conditioner  into  the  overall  HVAC  unit.  The  furnace  and  the
air  conditioner  were  each  controlled  by  an  independent
thermostat  installed  by  the  manufacturer.  Because  of  the
manner in which the manufacturer designed the HVAC system,
the first time the system was operated by the couple, cold air
was vented into the couple’s bedroom to keep the temperature
at 68°F. The cold air then activated the heater thermostat, and
hot  air  was  pumped  into  the  bedroom  of  the  couple’s  six-
month-old child. The temperature in the child’s room reached
more than 160°F before the child’s mother became aware of
the condition and shut the system off manually. As a result, the
child suffered permanent physical injury.

752

The  child,  through  a  duly  appointed  guardian,  has  asserted
claims against the manufacturer, the heating company, and the
cooling company (but not the retailer), all of which claims are
based  on  strict  liability  in  tort.  The  child  will  probably
recover against

(A)  the manufacturer only, because the ventilating system was

defectively designed by it.

(B)    the  heating  company  only,  because  it  was  the  excessive
heat from the furnace that caused the child’s injuries.
(C)    the  manufacturer  and  the  heating  company  only,  because
the  combination  of  the  manufacturer’s  design  and  the
heating company’s furnace caused the child’s injuries.
(D)    the  manufacturer,  the  heating  company,  and  the  cooling
company, because the combination of the manufacturer’s
design,  the  heating  company’s  furnace,  and  the  cooling
company’s  air  conditioning  unit  caused  the  child’s
injuries.

Answer 58:  Choice  (A)  is  correct.  The  manufacturer  is  the
only one of the three potential defendants who can be liable in
strict  liability.  A  person  who  is  engaged  in  the  business  of
selling products, and who sells a defective product, is subject
to  liability  for  harm  to  persons  or  property  caused  by  the
defect.  Rest.  3d  (Prod.  Liab.)  §  1.  One  type  of  defect  is  a
“design  defect.”  A  design  defect  occurs  “when 
the
foreseeable  risks  of  harm  posed  by  the  product  could  have
been  reduced  or  avoided  by  the  adoption  of  a  reasonable
alternative  design  by  the  seller  or  other  distributor,  or  a
predecessor  in  the  commercial  chain  of  distribution,  and  the
omission  of  the  alternative  design  renders  the  product  not
reasonably  safe.”  Rest.  3d  (Prod.  Liab.)  §  2(b).  Here,  the
manufacturer  will  be  strictly  liable  because  it  satisfies  the
required elements for strict liability: (1) it was in the business
of  selling  products;  (2)  it  sold  the  product  that  caused  the
harm here (the HVAC system); and (3) the HVAC system was
“defectively  designed,”  since  a  better  HVAC  system  was  a
reasonably  available  alternative  design  that  could  have
reduced  or  avoided  the  harm,  making  the  omission  of  such
alternative something that rendered the product not reasonably
safe.

753

Neither  the  heating  company  nor  the  cooling  company  is
liable  under  this  test,  since  neither  sold  the  defectively-
designed product (the HVAC system). It’s true that the heating
company and the cooling company sold components that went
into  the  defective  HVAC  system.  But  their  components  were
not  themselves  defective  at  the  time  of  sale,  and  these
defendants  did  not  do  anything  that  contributed  to  the
“downstream”  design  defect  introduced  by  the  manufacturer
(e.g.,  they  didn’t  give  the  manufacturer  instructions  that
induced the manufacturer to design the ventilating system in a
defective  manner).  So  they  cannot  be  said  to  have  “sold”  a
“defectively-designed product).”

Since (B), (C), and (D) all treat either the heating company or
the  cooling  company  as  liable,  these  choices  are  wrong  for
the reasons described in the discussion of Choice (A) above.

V.   DUTY TO WARN

A.  Unknown and unknowable dangers

1.  Check adequacy of warning

Question 59: Peter, who was 20 years old, purchased a new,
high-powered sports car that was marketed with an intended
and  recognized  appeal  to  youthful  drivers.  The  car  was
designed with the capability to attain speeds in excess of 100
miles per hour. It was equipped with tires designed and tested
only  for  a  maximum  safe  speed  of  85  miles  per  hour.  The
owner’s manual that came with the car stated that “continuous
driving over 90 miles per hour requires high-speed-capability
tires,” but the manual did not describe the speed capability of
the tires sold with the car.
Peter  took  his  new  car  out  for  a  spin  on  a  straight,  smooth
country road where the posted speed limit was 55 miles per
hour.  Intending  to  test  the  car’s  power,  he  drove  for  a
considerable  distance  at  over  100  miles  per  hour.  While  he
was  doing  so,  the  tread  separated  from  the  left  rear  tire,
causing the car to leave the road and hit a tree. Peter sustained
severe injuries.
Peter  has  brought  a  strict  product  liability  action  in  tort

754

against  the  manufacturer  of  the  car.  You  should  assume  that
pure comparative fault principles apply to this case.

Will Peter prevail?

(A)    No,  because  Peter’s  driving  at  an  excessive  speed

constituted a misuse of the car.
(B)  No, because the car was not defective.
(C)  Yes, if the statement in the manual concerning the tires did
not adequately warn of the danger of high-speed driving
on the tires mounted on the car.

(D)    Yes,  unless  Peter’s  driving  at  a  speed  in  excess  of  the
posted speed limit was negligence per se that, by the law
of the jurisdiction, was not excusable.

Answer 59: Choice (C) is correct. In product liability cases,
the duty to warn is in effect an extra duty. That is, even if the
product  would  not  be  defectively  dangerous  if  accompanied
by  the  appropriate  warning,  absence  of  such  a  warning  may
convert  the  product  into  a  defectively  dangerous  product  for
which there is strict product liability. So here, even if a tire
tread that can separate at speeds of 85+ would not have been
the  car
defectively  dangerous 
manufacturer  (which  “sold”  the  tires  as  part  of  the  original
car equipment) would be strictly liable if the manual did not
contain  an  adequate  warning  of  the  risk.  And  it’s  quite
plausible that the manual’s failure to specify that the tires that
came with the car were not the sort of “high-speed-capability
tires”  that  were  required  for  high  speeds  would  be  an
actionable failure to warn (especially in light of the fact that
the car was designed and marketed based on its ability to go
100+ mph).

if  properly  warned  of, 

(A)      is  wrong  because  it  is  not  a  misuse  of  a  sports  car  to
drive it at a speed in excess of 100 miles per hour when
that  was  a  use  intended  by  the  manufacturer  who
designed  the  car  for  high-speed  driving  and  who
marketed the car with an intended and recognized appeal
to youthful drivers.

(B)   is wrong because, as discussed in (C), the car might well
be “defective” in light of inadequate warnings about the
capabilities of the tires sold with it.

755

(D)   is wrong because if Peter was found to be negligent he
could  still  prevail.  The  facts  state  that  the  jurisdiction
applies a pure comparative fault system in strict product
liability actions. In a pure comparative fault system, the
plaintiff is allowed to recover even if his fault is greater
than  that  of  the  defendant.  The  plaintiff’s  recovery  is
reduced  by  a  proportion  equal  to  the  ratio  between  his
own fault and the total fault contributing to the accident.
Therefore, Peter’s negligence would not bar recovery in
this case, but merely reduce his recovery.

756

CHAPTER 12
NUISANCE

I.    PRIVATE NUISANCE

A.  Interference with use

that  requires 

Question 60: Electco operates a factory that requires the use
of very high voltage electricity. Paul owns property adjacent
to  the  Electco  plant  where  he  has  attempted  to  carry  on  a
business 
the  use  of  sensitive  electronic
equipment.  The  effectiveness  of  Paul’s  electronic  equipment
is  impaired  by  electrical  interference  arising  from  the  high
voltage currents used in Electco’s plant. Paul has complained
to Electco several times, with no result. There is no way that
Electco,  by  taking  reasonable  precautions,  can  avoid  the
interference  with  Paul’s  operation  that  arises  from  the  high
voltage currents necessary to Electo’s operation.
In  Paul’s  action  against  Electco  to  recover  damages  for  the
economic  loss  caused  to  him  by  the  electrical  interference,
will Paul prevail?

(A)  Yes, because Electco’s activity is abnormally dangerous.
(B)    Yes,  for  loss  suffered  by  Paul  after  Electco  was  made
aware of the harm its activity was causing to Paul.
(C)  No, unless Electco caused a substantial and unreasonable

interference with Paul’s business.

(D)    No,  because  Paul’s  harm  was  purely  economic  and  did

not arise from physical harm to his person or property.
Answer 60:  Choice  (C)  is  correct.  Paul  can  win  only  on  a
nuisance  theory  (not  on  negligence  or  strict  liability  for
ultrahazardous activities, as to which see Choice (A) below).
So  let’s  analyze  whether  the  requirements  for  nuisance  are
satisfied  here.  A  private  nuisance  is  an  unreasonable
interference with the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of his land.
In  order  to  recover  for  private  nuisance,  the  plaintiff  must
show (1) that his use and enjoyment of his land was interfered
with  in  a  “substantial”  way  and  (2)  that  the  defendant’s
conduct was negligent, abnormally dangerous, or intentional.

757

The  facts  state  that  the  effectiveness  of  Paul’s  electronic
equipment 
interference  from
Electo’s  plant.  But  unless  the  interference  with  Paul’s
business is substantial and unreasonable, Paul cannot prevail.

(A)   is wrong because Electo’s use of high voltage electricity
would  not  be  found  to  be  abnormally  dangerous,
especially  considering  the  fact  that  the  harm  it  caused
(interference  with  use  of  land)  was  not  dangerous.
Activities  considered  “abnormally  dangerous”  are
subject  to  strict  liability.  The  Second  Restatement  lists
factors to consider when determining whether an activity
is abnormally dangerous: (1) it creates a high degree of
risk; (2) it poses a risk of serious harm; (3) it cannot be
eliminated even by due care; (4) it is uncommon and (5)
it is inappropriate at the particular site. Liability is more
likely  to  be  imposed  where  the  activity’s  value  to  the
community  is  outweighed  by  its  dangerous  attributes.
Rest. 2d, § 520. Here, factors (3), (4), and (5) cut against
liability. Generally, electric utilities are found not to be
engaged in an ultrahazardous activity when they maintain
power lines.

(B)   is wrong because, if the interference with Paul’s business
was not substantial and unreasonable, then Electo would
not  be  responsible  in  nuisance  for  any  harm  caused  to
Paul, even that harm of which it was subsequently made
aware.

(D)   is wrong because there has been harm to Paul’s property.
There  has  been  physical  harm  to  equipment  located  on
his property, from Electo’s activity.

B.  Unreasonableness

1.  Test for unreasonableness

a.  Noise and unattractive sights

Question 61: Palmco owns and operates a beachfront hotel.
Under  a  contract  with  City  to  restore  a  public  beach,
Dredgeco  placed  a  large  and  unavoidably  dangerous  stone-
crushing  machine  on  City  land  near  Palmco’s  hotel.  The
machine  creates  a  continuous  and  intense  noise  that  is  so
disturbing  to  the  hotel  guests  that  they  have  canceled  their

758

hotel reservations in large numbers, resulting in a substantial
loss to Palmco.

Palmco’s  best  chance  to  recover  damages  for  its  financial
losses from Dredgeco is under the theory that the operation of
the stone-crushing machine constitutes

interference  with 

(A)  an abnormally dangerous activity.
(B)  a private nuisance.
(C)  negligence.
(D)  a trespass.
Answer 61: Choice (B)  is  correct.  A  private  nuisance  is  an
the  plaintiff’s  use  and
unreasonable 
enjoyment of his land. Rest. 2d, § 822. Whereas trespass is an
interference with the plaintiff’s right of exclusive possession
of  his  property,  nuisance  is  an  interference  with  his  right  to
use  and  enjoy  it.  A  condition,  such  as  noise,  near  the
plaintiff’s  property  that  interferes  with  his  peace  of  mind
would  be  a  nuisance,  but  not  a  trespass,  since  nothing
physically entered the property. Palmco might not win on its
nuisance theory (the court might hold that the social utility of
the  beach  restoration  project  outweighs  the  damage  to
Palmco’s  use  and  enjoyment),  but  of  the  theories  listed  it  is
the only one that is plausible.

(A)      is  wrong  because,  even  though  operating  a  stone-
crushing  machine  may  very  well  be  an  abnormally
dangerous  activity,  and  worthy  of  applying  strict
liability,  the  only  harm  caused  thus  far  is  noise.  And
noise  is  not  the  kind  of  harm  that  makes  using  a  stone-
crushing machine abnormally dangerous (if, indeed, use
of such a machine is abnormally dangerous).

(C)   is wrong because a plaintiff generally cannot recover in
negligence  for  pure  economic  loss,  in  the  absence  of
harm to the plaintiff’s person or property. No exception
to this general rule applies here.

(D)      is  wrong  because  trespass  liability  requires  physical
entry  by  the  defendant  (or  by  some  object  under  the
defendant’s control) onto the plaintiff’s property. Sound
waves are deemed insufficiently physical to give rise to
trespass liability.

CHAPTER 13
DEFAMATION

I.    DEFAMATORY COMMUNICATION

A.  Opinion

1.  Multiple possible interpretations 

a.  Applicable to statement of opinion

Question  62:  Doe,  the  governor  of  State,  signed  a  death
warrant for Rend, a convicted murderer. Able and Baker are
active  opponents  of  the  death  penalty.  At  a  demonstration
protesting  the  execution  of  Rend,  Able  and  Baker  carried
that  stated,  “Governor  Doe — Murderer.”
large  signs 
Television  station  XYZ  broadcast  news  coverage  of  the
demonstration, including pictures of the signs carried by Able
and  Baker.  If  Governor  Doe  asserts  a  defamation  claim
against XYZ, will Doe prevail?

(A)  Yes, because the signs would cause persons to hold Doe

in lower esteem.

(B)    Yes,  if  Doe  proves  that  XYZ  showed  the  signs  with
knowledge  of  falsity  or  reckless  disregard  of  the  truth
that Doe had not committed homicide.

(C)    No,  unless  Doe  proves  he  suffered  pecuniary  loss
resulting from harm to his reputation proximately caused
by the defendants’ signs.

the 

interpreted  only 

(D)  No, if the only reasonable interpretation of the signs was
intended  as  a
that 
term  “murderer”  was 
characterization of one who would sign a death warrant.
Answer  62:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  If  a  statement  could  be
reasonably 
that
interpretation  must  in  fact  be  defamatory  in  order  for  a
plaintiff to prevail in a case of defamation. Here, the answer
states  that  there  is  only  one  reasonable  interpretation,  that
“murderer”  means  one  who  would  sign  a  death  warrant.
Therefore, the statement was pure opinion (that one who signs
a  death  warrant  is  properly  classified  as  a  murderer),  not  a
provably false fact.

in  one  way, 

then 

760

(A)   is wrong because there must be an element of disgrace
connected  with  the  allegation,  not  a  mere  lowering  of
esteem,  in  order  for  the  statement  to  be  deemed
defamatory. Also, to be defamatory a statement must be a
provably  false  statement  of  fact,  and  this  isn’t  (for
reasons described in the analysis of (D) above).

(B)   is wrong because the foundation for the defamation claim
must  be  laid  before  the  constitutional  questions  are
addressed.  It  is  true  that  when  the  plaintiff  is  a  public
official  there  is  an  additional  requirement  that  the
defendant make the accusation with knowledge of falsity
or reckless disregard of the truth. New York Times Co. v.
Sulllivan (1964). However, the common law elements of
the  claim  must  be  satisfied  first.  To  be  defamatory  a
statement must be a provably false statement of fact, and
this  isn’t  (for  reasons  described  in  the  analysis  of  (D)
above).  Therefore  Governor  Doe  would  fail  in  setting
out a claim for defamation even before the constitutional
issues were addressed.

(C)   is wrong because if this is libel, then the plaintiff does
not have to show “special harm” of a pecuniary nature,
and  if  it  is  slander,  then  it  would  be  categorized  as
“slander per se.” It is unclear whether the sign broadcast
on  television  news  would  be  considered  libel  (written
or  printed  matter)  or  slander  (oral  and  all  other
statements).  “Special  harm”  of  a  pecuniary  nature  need
not  be  proven  for  libelous  statements.  A  statement
imputing  criminal  behavior  to  the  plaintiff  that  is
“punishable  by  imprisonment”  or  “regarded  by  public
opinion as involving moral turpitude” is “slander per se”
and  does  not  require  a  showing  of  special  harm  either.
Rest.  2d  §  571.  Therefore,  however  the  statement  is
categorized, pecuniary loss need not be proven in order
for the plaintiff to prevail.

II.   PUBLICATION

A.  Requirement of publication generally

1.  Must be intentional or negligent

761

a.  Frequent on MBE

Question 63:  Drew,  the  owner  of  a  truck  leasing  company,
asked Pat, one of Drew’s employees, to deliver $1,000 to the
dealership’s main office. The following week, as a result of a
dispute  over  whether  the  money  had  been  delivered,  Drew
instructed Pat to come to the office to submit to a lie detector
test.

When  Pat  reported  to  Drew’s  office  for  the  test,  it  was  not
administered.  Instead,  without  hearing  Pat’s  story,  Drew
shouted at him, “You’re a thief,” and fired him. Drew’s shout
was  overheard  by  several  other  employees  who  were  in
another office, which was separated from Drew’s office by a
thin  partition.  The  next  day,  Pat  accepted  another  job  at  a
higher salary. Several weeks later, upon discovering that the
money had not been stolen, Drew offered to rehire Pat.

In a suit for slander by Pat against Drew, Pat will

(A)  prevail, because Pat was fraudulently induced to go to the
office  for  a  lie  detector  test,  which  was  not,  in  fact,
given.

(B)  prevail, if Drew should have foreseen that the statement

would be overheard by other employees.

(C)    not  prevail,  if  Drew  made  the  charge  in  good  faith,

believing it to be true.

(D)  not prevail, because the statement was made to Pat alone

and intended for his ears only.

Answer  63:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  One  of  the  elements  of
defamation is “publication,” i.e., the fact that the defamatory
statement was communicated to at least one person other than
the  plaintiff.  Furthermore,  plaintiff  must  show  that  defendant
acted  either  negligently  or  intentionally  with  regard  to
publication.  So  if  defendant  neither  knew  nor  had  reason  to
know  that  the  statement  would  be  heard  and  understood  by
someone  other  than  the  plaintiff,  the  publication  requirement
has  not  been  satisfied,  but  if  defendant  did  have  reason  to
anticipate such an overhearing, then the requirement has been
satisfied.

(A)      is  wrong  because  whether  or  not  Pat  was  fraudulently
induced into the office is irrelevant to the determination

762

of his slander suit.

(C)   is wrong. Drew could have been negligent in believing in
the charge. If Drew was indeed negligent in not verifying
the  truth  of  the  theft  accusation,  his  “good  faith”  (i.e.,
honest  belief  in  the  statement’s  truth)  won’t  shield  him.
That  is,  where,  as  here,  the  plaintiff  is  not  a  public
figure,  plaintiff  may  recover  for  defamation  based  on  a
mere  showing  of  negligence  regarding  the  truth,  rather
than  knowledge  of  falsity  or  reckless  disregard  of  the
truth  (which  public-figure  plaintiffs  have  to  show,  as  a
constitutional  matter  under  N.Y.  Times  v.  Sullivan
(1964)).

(D)   is wrong because if Drew should have foreseen that his
statement  would  be  overheard  by  another  person,  then
the publication element was satisfied, as discussed in the
explanation of Choice (C).

2.  Must be understood

Question  64:  Able  and  Baker  are  students  in  an  advanced
high school Russian class. During an argument one day in the
high school cafeteria, in the presence of other students, Able,
in  Russian,  accused  Baker  of  taking  money  from  Able’s
locker.
In  a  suit  by  Baker  against  Able  based  on  defamation,  Baker
will

(A)    prevail,  because  Able’s  accusation  constituted  slander

per se.

(B)    prevail,  because  the  defamatory  statement  was  made  in

the presence of third persons.

(C)    not  prevail,  unless  Able  made  the  accusation  with
knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of the truth.

(D)    not  prevail,  unless  one  or  more  of  the  other  students

understood Russian.

Answer 64:  Choice  (D)  is  correct.  In  a  common  law  claim
for defamation, the plaintiff must show that a (1) defamatory
statement (2) regarding the plaintiff (3) was communicated to
at  least  one  other  person  (publication)  and  (4)  that  the
plaintiff’s reputation was damaged. In addition, some degree
of fault will usually have to be proven. The issue in this fact

763

pattern  is  whether  the  statement  was  published.  Able’s
statement  was  made  in  a  foreign  language,  so  although  there
were other students present, it is not clear whether or not the
statement  was  understood  (the  fact  pattern  does  not,  for
instance,  indicate  that  the  fellow  classmates  who  heard  the
statement  were  in  the  advanced  Russian  language  course).  It
is  therefore  unclear  whether  the  “publication”  element  has
been  satisfied,  and  Baker  cannot  prevail  unless  it  is
determined  that  at  least  one  of  the  other  students  understood
Able’s statement.

to  fulfill 

(A)      is  wrong  because  even  if  the  statement  could  be
categorized as “slander per se,” Baker would still have
to prove all the other elements of a defamation case; he
still  needs  to  show  that  the  statement  was  indeed
understood by at least one other student in the cafeteria
in  order 
the  “publication”  element.  To
ultimately prevail in a case of slander, the plaintiff must
usually  show  special  harm  of  a  pecuniary  nature  unless
the statement is categorized as “slander per se.” Rest. 2d
§  558.  A  statement  imputing  criminal  behavior  to  the
imprisonment”  or
plaintiff 
“regarded  by  public  opinion  as 
involving  moral
turpitude”  falls  under  this  category.  Rest.  2d  §  571.
However, even if Baker’s alleged crime of taking money
would  fall  under  the  category  of  slander  per  se,  Baker
would  still  need  to  overcome  the  hurdle  of  proving  the
publication  element,  as  discussed  in  the  explanation  of
(D).

is  “punishable  by 

that 

(B)   is wrong because the “publication” requirement not only
requires that the statement be made in the presence of at
least  one  other  person,  but  that  the  third  person
understand  it  and  perceive  its  defamatory  aspects.  The
fact  pattern  is  vague  on  this  matter.  Therefore,  in  order
for  Baker  to  prevail,  it  must  be  determined  that  the
statement was understood by a third person, as discussed
in the explanation of (D).

(C)   is wrong because the requirement that the defendant make
the  accusation  with  knowledge  of  falsity  or  reckless
disregard of the truth applies only when the plaintiff is a

764

public  official  or  public  figure.  New  York  Times  Co.  v.
Sulllivan  (1964).  Baker,  as  a  student,  clearly  doesn’t
qualify as a public figure or public official.

III.  FAULT

A.  Constitutional decisions

1.  Private figures

a.  P must prove at least negligence

i.  Serious doubts about statement’s truth

Question 65: Allen and Bradley were law school classmates
who  had  competed  for  the  position  of  editor  of  the  law
review. Allen had the higher grade point average, but Bradley
was  elected  editor,  largely  in  recognition  of  a  long  and
important note that had appeared in the review over her name.

During the following placement interview season, Allen was
interviewed by a representative of a nationally prominent law
firm. In response to the interviewer’s request for information
about the authorship of the law review note, Allen said that he
had  heard  that  the  note  attributed  to  Bradley  was  largely  the
work of another student.
The firm told Bradley that it would not interview her because
of  doubts  about  the  authorship  of  the  note.  This  greatly
distressed  Bradley.  In  fact  the  note  had  been  prepared  by
Bradley without assistance from anyone else.

If Bradley asserts a claim against Allen based on defamation,
Bradley will

(A)  recover, because Allen’s statement was false.
(B)    recover,  if  Allen  had  substantial  doubts  about  the
accuracy of the information he gave the interviewer.

(C)  not recover, unless Bradley proves pecuniary loss.
(D)    not  recover,  because  the  statement  was  made  by  Allen
only  after  the  interviewer  inquired  about  the  authorship
of the note.

Answer  65:  Choice  (B)  is  correct.  Even  under  Supreme
restrictions,  states  are
Court  First  Amendment-based 

765

permitted  to  give  a  private  (i.e.,  non-public-figure)  plaintiff
the  right  to  win  if  the  plaintiff  can  show  that  the  defendant
made a defamatory falsehood and behaved at least negligently
with  respect  to  the  statement’s  truth.  Since  Bradley  is  not  a
public  figure, 
the  defendant  entertained
that 
substantial doubts about the truth of the statement is more than
enough  to  prove  negligence.  (In  fact,  such  doubts  probably
even establish the “reckless disregard of the truth” variety of
“actual  malice,”  which  Bradley  would  have  to  show  if  he
were a public figure.)

the  fact 

(A)      is  wrong  because  it  is  not  enough  to  prove  that  the
statement was false. All states require that some degree
of fault be proven on the part of the defendant.

(C)   is wrong because special harm need not be proven in this
case. A plaintiff may generally establish slander only if
she  can  show  that  she  sustained  some  special  harm,
usually  required  to  be  of  a  pecuniary  nature.  However,
there  are  four  kinds  of  utterances,  categorized  as
“slander  per  se,”  which,  even  though  they  are  slander
rather  than  libel,  require  no  showing  of  special  harm.
One  of  these  is  an  allegation  that  adversely  reflects  on
the  plaintiff’s  fitness  to  conduct  her  business,  trade,
profession, or office. That kind of utterance occurred in
this case.

(D)   is wrong because it is irrelevant. A defamatory statement
is  actionable,  despite  the  fact  that  it  came  out  in  a
conversation  where 
the  subject  matter  was  being
inquired  into.  The  defendant  may  have  a  privilege  to
respond  to  a  reasonable  inquiry,  but  the  privilege  is  a
qualified one, which is lost if it is abused by defendant’s
negligence concerning the truth or falsity of the answer.

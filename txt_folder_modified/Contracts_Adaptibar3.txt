Question 1508 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

A restaurant supplier sent a letter to a regular customer offering to sell the customer an industrial freezer for
$10,000. Two days later, the customer responded with a letter that stated: "I accept your offer on the condition
that you provide me with a warranty that the freezer is merchantable." In response to the customer's letter, the
supplier called the customer and stated that the offer was no longer open. The supplier promptly sold the
freezer to another buyer for $11,000.  

If the customer sues the supplier for breach of contract, is the customer likely to prevail? 

A: No, because the customer's letter added a term, making it a counteroffer.
B: No, because the subsequent sale to a bona fide purchaser for value cut off the claims of the customer.
C: Yes, because the customer's letter was an acceptance of the supplier's offer, since the warranty of
merchantability was already implied in the sale.
D: Yes, because the supplier's letter was a firm offer that could not be revoked for a reasonable time.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is Incorrect. It is true that a purported acceptance that is conditioned on an offeror's assent to a term
additional to or different from the terms contained in an offer is a counteroffer. In this case, however, the
customer's letter constituted an acceptance rather than a counteroffer. Under UCC § 2-314, a warranty of
merchantability is implied in every contract for the sale of a good by a seller who is a merchant with respect to
goods of that kind. Therefore, the condition contained in the customer's letter merely stated a term that was
already implied in the sale. A contract arose when the customer mailed its letter accepting the offer.
Accordingly, the supplier's attempted revocation of its offer was ineffective, and its sale of the freezer to the
third party breached its contract with the customer.  

B is Incorrect. Under some circumstances, the sale of goods to a bona fide purchaser may cut off the claims of
other parties. In this case, however, the dispositive issue is whether the customer's letter in response to the
supplier's offer constituted an acceptance or a counteroffer. Under UCC § 2-314, a warranty of merchantability
is implied in every contract for the sale of a good by a seller who is a merchant with respect to goods of that
kind. Therefore, the condition contained in the customer's letter merely stated a term that was already implied
in the sale. A contract arose when the customer mailed its letter accepting the offer. Accordingly, the supplier's
attempted revocation of its offer was ineffective, and its sale of the freezer to the third party breached its
contract with the customer.  

C is Correct. It is true that a purported acceptance that is conditioned on an offeror's assent to a term
additional to or different from the terms contained in an offer is a counteroffer. In this case, however, the
customer's letter constituted an acceptance rather than a counteroffer. Under UCC § 2-314, a warranty of

goods of that kind. Therefore, the condition contained in the customer's letter merely stated a term that was
already implied in the sale. A contract arose when the customer mailed its letter accepting the offer.
Accordingly, the supplier's attempted revocation of its offer was ineffective, and its sale of the freezer to the
third party breached its contract with the customer.  

D is Incorrect. The supplier's letter did not create a firm offer because it failed to give assurance that the offer
would be held open, a principal requirement of a firm offer under UCC § 2-205. The dispositive issue here is
whether the customer's response to the supplier's offer constituted an acceptance or a counteroffer. Under
UCC § 2-314, a warranty of merchantability is implied in every contract for the sale of a good by a seller who is
a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. Therefore, the condition contained in the customer's letter
merely stated a term that was already implied in the sale. A contract arose when the customer mailed its letter
accepting the offer. Accordingly, the supplier's attempted revocation of its offer was ineffective, and its sale of
the freezer to the third party breached its contract with the customer.

Question 1513 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts

 The question was: 

A seller sent an email to a potential buyer, offering to sell his house to her for $150,000. The buyer
immediately responded via email, asking whether the offer included the house's front porch swing. The seller
emailed back: "No, it doesn't." The buyer then ordered a front porch swing and emailed back to the seller: "I
accept your offer." The seller refused to sell the house to the buyer, claiming that the offer was no longer open.

Is there a contract for the sale of the house? 

A: No, because the buyer's initial email was a counteroffer.
B: No, because the offer lapsed before the buyer accepted.
C: Yes, because the buyer relied on the offer by ordering the swing.
D: Yes, because the buyer's initial email merely asked for information.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. A reply to an offer that merely requests information regarding the offer constitutes an inquiry
rather than a counteroffer. The buyer's response asking whether the seller intended to include the front porch
swing in his offer was an inquiry rather than a counteroffer. The buyer's subsequent email stating "I accept
your offer" was an acceptance that created a contract between the parties. Therefore, the seller's attempted
revocation of his offer was ineffective.  

B is incorrect. An offeree's power of acceptance may terminate due to a lapse of time when the offeree fails to
accept the offer within the time stated in the offer or within a reasonable time. In this case, the offer did not
include an express time limitation. Therefore, the buyer could accept within a reasonable period of time. The
email exchanges between the buyer and the seller demonstrate that the buyer accepted the seller's offer within
a reasonable time period. The dispositive issue here is whether the buyer's reply to the seller's offer
constituted an acceptance or a counteroffer.

an acceptance that created a contract between the parties. Therefore, the seller's attempted revocation of his
offer was ineffective.  

C is incorrect. An offeree's reliance on an offer can create a binding option contract that precludes an offeror
from revoking its offer. In this case, however, there is no indication that the buyer's purchase of the swing was
the type of act performed in substantial reliance on the offer that the seller reasonably could have expected at
the time he communicated his offer. The dispositive issue here is whether the buyer's reply to the seller's offer
constituted an acceptance or a counteroffer.

Question 1518 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

In a telephone conversation, a jewelry maker offered to buy 100 ounces of gold from a precious metals
company if delivery could be made within 10 days. The jewelry maker did not specify a price, but the market
price for 100 ounces of gold at the time of the conversation was approximately $65,000. Without otherwise
responding, the company delivered the gold six days later.  

In the meantime, the project for which the jewelry maker planned to use the gold was canceled. The jewelry
maker therefore refused to accept delivery of the gold or to pay the $65,000 demanded by the company.  

Is there an enforceable contract between the jewelry maker and the company? 

A: No, because the parties did not agree on a price term.
B: No, because the parties did not put their agreement in writing.
C: Yes, because the absence of a price term does not defeat the formation of a valid contract for the sale of
goods where the parties otherwise intended to form a contract.
D: Yes, because the company relied on an implied promise to pay when it delivered the gold.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Under UCC § 2-305, a contract may be enforceable in the absence of a price term so long as
the parties otherwise intended to enter into a contract. In this case, the dispositive issue is whether the parties'
oral agreement is enforceable. Under UCC § 2-201(1), a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or
more is not enforceable unless there is a writing indicating the contract that is signed by the party against
whom enforcement is sought. In this case, the absence of such a writing signed by the jewelry maker renders
the parties' oral agreement unenforceable. An exception to the writing requirement arises when a seller
delivers goods that are accepted by the buyer, but in this case, the jewelry maker did not accept the gold.  

B is correct. The parties failed to comply with the writing requirement of UCC § 2-201(1). Under that section, a
contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or more is not enforceable unless there is a writing indicating
a contract of sale that is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. In this case, the absence of
such a writing signed by the jewelry maker renders the parties' oral agreement unenforceable. An exception to
the writing requirement arises when a seller delivers goods that are accepted by the buyer, but in this case, the
jewelry maker did not accept the gold.  

C is incorrect. Under UCC § 2-305, a contract may be enforceable in the absence of a price term so long as

goods where the parties otherwise intended to form a contract.
D: Yes, because the company relied on an implied promise to pay when it delivered the gold.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Under UCC § 2-305, a contract may be enforceable in the absence of a price term so long as
the parties otherwise intended to enter into a contract. In this case, the dispositive issue is whether the parties'
oral agreement is enforceable. Under UCC § 2-201(1), a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or
more is not enforceable unless there is a writing indicating the contract that is signed by the party against
whom enforcement is sought. In this case, the absence of such a writing signed by the jewelry maker renders
the parties' oral agreement unenforceable. An exception to the writing requirement arises when a seller
delivers goods that are accepted by the buyer, but in this case, the jewelry maker did not accept the gold.  

B is correct. The parties failed to comply with the writing requirement of UCC § 2-201(1). Under that section, a
contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or more is not enforceable unless there is a writing indicating
a contract of sale that is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. In this case, the absence of
such a writing signed by the jewelry maker renders the parties' oral agreement unenforceable. An exception to
the writing requirement arises when a seller delivers goods that are accepted by the buyer, but in this case, the
jewelry maker did not accept the gold.  

C is incorrect. Under UCC § 2-305, a contract may be enforceable in the absence of a price term so long as

Question 1518 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

In a telephone conversation, a jewelry maker offered to buy 100 ounces of gold from a precious metals
company if delivery could be made within 10 days. The jewelry maker did not specify a price, but the market
price for 100 ounces of gold at the time of the conversation was approximately $65,000. Without otherwise
responding, the company delivered the gold six days later.  

In the meantime, the project for which the jewelry maker planned to use the gold was canceled. The jewelry
maker therefore refused to accept delivery of the gold or to pay the $65,000 demanded by the company.  

Is there an enforceable contract between the jewelry maker and the company? 

A: No, because the parties did not agree on a price term.
B: No, because the parties did not put their agreement in writing.
C: Yes, because the absence of a price term does not defeat the formation of a valid contract for the sale of
goods where the parties otherwise intended to form a contract.

Question 1524 - Contracts - Consideration

 The question was: 

A man sent an email to a friend that stated: "Because you have been a great friend to me, I am going to give
you a rare book that I own." The friend replied by an email that said: "Thanks for the rare book. I am going to
give you my butterfly collection." The rare book was worth $10,000; the butterfly collection was worth $100.
The friend delivered the butterfly collection to the man, but the man refused to deliver the book.  

If the friend sues the man to recover the value of the book, how should the court rule? 

A: For the man, because there was no bargained-for exchange to support his promise.
B: For the man, because the consideration given for his promise was inadequate.
C: For the friend, because she gave the butterfly collection to the man in reliance on receiving the book.
D: For the friend, because she conferred a benefit on the man by delivering the butterfly collection.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is correct. To constitute consideration, a return promise must be bargained for. A return promise is
bargained for when it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in
exchange for that promise. Because the man's promise to give the rare book to the friend did not seek a return
promise or performance, the friend's promise to give the man her butterfly collection did not constitute
consideration for the man's promise. Accordingly, no contract arose between the parties, and the court should
rule in favor of the man.  

B is incorrect. Instead of giving inadequate consideration, the friend gave no consideration at all. To constitute
consideration, a return promise must be bargained for. A return promise is bargained for when it is sought by
the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise. Because
the man's promise to give the rare book to the friend did not seek a return promise or performance, the friend's
promise to give the man her butterfly collection did not constitute consideration for the man's promise.
Accordingly, no contract arose between the parties, and the court should rule in favor of the man.  

C is incorrect. Although it is true that a promisee's reliance may provide the basis for the enforcement of a
promise in the absence of consideration, that principle is inapplicable here. The man's promise failed to induce
reliance by the friend of the type that the man reasonably might have expected when he promised to give her
the rare book. In addition, this is not a case in which injustice could only be avoided by the enforcement of the
man's promise. The dispositive issue here is whether the friend's promise to give her butterfly collection to the
man constituted consideration for the man's promise. Because the man's promise to give the rare book to the
friend did not seek a return promise or performance, the friend's promise did not constitute consideration for
the man's promise. Accordingly, no contract arose between the parties, and the court should rule in favor of
the man.  

D is incorrect. The fact that a promisee confers a benefit on a promisor does not create an enforceable
obligation on the part of the promisor. The dispositive issue here is whether the friend's promise to give her
butterfly collection to the man constituted consideration for the man's promise. Because the man's promise to
give the rare book to the friend did not seek a return promise or performance, the friend's promise did not
constitute consideration for the man's promise. Accordingly, no contract arose between the parties, and the
court should rule in favor of the man.

Question 1530 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

A farmer who wanted to sell her land received a letter from a developer that stated, "I will pay you $1,100 an
acre for your land." The farmer's letter of reply stated, "I accept your offer." Unbeknownst to the farmer, the
developer had intended to offer only $1,000 per acre but had mistakenly typed "$1,100." As both parties knew,
comparable land in the vicinity had been selling at prices between $1,000 and $1,200 per acre.  

Which of the following states the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between the parties? 

A: There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.
B: There is no enforceable contract, because the developer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake as
to a basic assumption of the contract.
C: There is a contract formed at a price of $1,000 per acre.
D: There is a contract formed at a price of $1,100 per acre.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. There is a general rule that contract formation may be defeated, under some circumstances,
where parties attach materially different meanings to a material term. That rule, however, is inapplicable here
where the critical issue relates to the developer's intent, as manifested by his conduct, and the impact of the
farmer's lack of knowledge of the developer's mistake. An enforceable contract requires mutual assent as
determined by the parties' objective, rather than subjective, manifestations of that assent. Here, given the
parties' knowledge of the price of comparable land, the developer's offer created a reasonable understanding
that the developer would purchase the land for $1,100 per acre. Moreover, because the farmer neither knew
nor had reason to know that the developer intended to purchase the land for only $1,000 per acre, the
developer will be bound to purchase it for $1,100 per acre. Accordingly, the parties' conduct gave rise to a
contract formed at $1,100 per acre when the farmer accepted the developer's offer.  

B is incorrect. While a mutual mistake may give rise to an action for rescission, there was no mutual mistake in
this case. The critical issue here relates to the developer's intent as manifested by his conduct, and the impact
of the farmer's lack of knowledge of the developer's mistake. An enforceable contract requires mutual assent
as determined by the parties' objective, rather than subjective, manifestations of assent. Given the parties'
knowledge of the price of comparable land, the developer's offer created a reasonable understanding that the
developer would purchase the land for $1,100 per acre. Moreover, because the farmer neither knew nor had
reason to know that the developer intended to purchase the land for only $1,000 per acre, the developer will
be bound to purchase it for $1,100 per acre. Accordingly, the parties' conduct gave rise to a contract formed at
$1,100 per acre when the farmer accepted the developer's offer.  

C is incorrect. An enforceable contract requires mutual assent as determined by the parties' objective, rather
than subjective, manifestations of assent. Given the parties' knowledge of the price of comparable land, the
developer's offer created a reasonable understanding that the developer would purchase the land for $1,100
per acre. Moreover, because the farmer neither knew nor had reason to know that the developer intended to
purchase the land for only $1,000 per acre, the developer will be bound to purchase it for $1,100 per acre.
Accordingly, the parties' conduct gave rise to a contract formed at $1,100 per acre when the farmer accepted
the developer's offer.  

D is correct. An enforceable contract requires mutual assent as determined by the parties' objective, rather
than subjective, manifestations of assent. Given the parties' knowledge of the price of comparable land, the
developer's offer created a reasonable understanding that the developer would purchase the land for $1,100
per acre. Moreover, because the farmer neither knew nor had reason to know that the developer intended to
purchase the land for only $1,000 per acre, the developer will be bound to purchase it for $1,100 per acre.
Accordingly, the parties' conduct gave rise to a contract formed at $1,100 per acre when the farmer accepted
the developer's offer.

developer will be bound to purchase it for $1,100 per acre. Accordingly, the parties' conduct gave rise to a
contract formed at $1,100 per acre when the farmer accepted the developer's offer.  

B is incorrect. While a mutual mistake may give rise to an action for rescission, there was no mutual mistake in
this case. The critical issue here relates to the developer's intent as manifested by his conduct, and the impact
of the farmer's lack of knowledge of the developer's mistake. An enforceable contract requires mutual assent
as determined by the parties' objective, rather than subjective, manifestations of assent. Given the parties'
knowledge of the price of comparable land, the developer's offer created a reasonable understanding that the
developer would purchase the land for $1,100 per acre. Moreover, because the farmer neither knew nor had
reason to know that the developer intended to purchase the land for only $1,000 per acre, the developer will

Question 1530 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability

 The question was: 

A farmer who wanted to sell her land received a letter from a developer that stated, "I will pay you $1,100 an
acre for your land." The farmer's letter of reply stated, "I accept your offer." Unbeknownst to the farmer, the
developer had intended to offer only $1,000 per acre but had mistakenly typed "$1,100." As both parties knew,
comparable land in the vicinity had been selling at prices between $1,000 and $1,200 per acre.  

Which of the following states the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between the parties? 

A: There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.
B: There is no enforceable contract, because the developer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake as
to a basic assumption of the contract.
C: There is a contract formed at a price of $1,000 per acre.
D: There is a contract formed at a price of $1,100 per acre.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. There is a general rule that contract formation may be defeated, under some circumstances,
where parties attach materially different meanings to a material term. That rule, however, is inapplicable here
where the critical issue relates to the developer's intent, as manifested by his conduct, and the impact of the
farmer's lack of knowledge of the developer's mistake. An enforceable contract requires mutual assent as
determined by the parties' objective, rather than subjective, manifestations of that assent. Here, given the
parties' knowledge of the price of comparable land, the developer's offer created a reasonable understanding
that the developer would purchase the land for $1,100 per acre. Moreover, because the farmer neither knew
nor had reason to know that the developer intended to purchase the land for only $1,000 per acre, the
developer will be bound to purchase it for $1,100 per acre. Accordingly, the parties' conduct gave rise to a
contract formed at $1,100 per acre when the farmer accepted the developer's offer.

developer's offer created a reasonable understanding that the developer would purchase the land for $1,100
per acre. Moreover, because the farmer neither knew nor had reason to know that the developer intended to

Accordingly, the parties' conduct gave rise to a contract formed at $1,100 per acre when the farmer accepted

D is correct. An enforceable contract requires mutual assent as determined by the parties' objective, rather

Question 1536 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation

 The question was: 

A buyer and a seller entered into a written contract for the sale of a copy machine, using the same form
contract that they had used a number of times in the past. The contract stated that payment was due 30 days
after delivery and provided that the writing contained the complete and exclusive statement of the parties'
agreement.  

On several past occasions, the buyer had taken a 5% discount from the contract price when paying within 10
days of delivery, and the seller had not objected. On this occasion, when the buyer took a 5% discount for
paying within 10 days, the seller objected because his profit margin on this particular machine was smaller
than on his other machines.  

If the seller sues the buyer for breach of contract, may the buyer introduce evidence that the 5% discount was
a term of the agreement? 

A: No, because the seller timely objected to the buyer's proposal for different terms.
B: No, because the writing contained the complete and exclusive agreement of the parties.
C: Yes, because a modification made in good faith does not require consideration.
D: Yes, because evidence of course of dealing is admissible even if the writing contains the complete and
exclusive agreement of the parties.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Under UCC § 1-303(b), course of dealing is defined as "a sequence of conduct concerning
previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ." In this case, on several past
occasions the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection from the seller, thus establishing a course of
dealing. Given the course of dealing between the parties, the seller's objection to the 5% discount, after the
buyer had acted in accordance with the course of dealing, was ineffective. Under the UCC's parol evidence
rule, course-of-dealing evidence is admissible to explain or supplement a final written agreement.  

B is incorrect. Under UCC § 1-303(b), course of dealing is defined as "a sequence of conduct concerning
previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ." In this case, on several past
occasions the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection from the seller, thus establishing a course of
dealing. Under the UCC's parol evidence rule, course-of-dealing evidence is admissible to explain or
supplement a final written agreement even if the parties intended the agreement to be complete and exclusive.
Accordingly, the course-of-dealing evidence is admissible.  

C is incorrect. UCC Article 2 contains a general rule that a good- faith modification does not require
consideration to be enforceable. However, the enforceability of a modification is not at issue here. The issue
here is whether the UCC's parol evidence rule will preclude the admissibility of evidence of course of dealing.
The facts indicate that in the parties' previous contracts the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection
from the seller. This conduct amounted to a course of dealing that is defined under UCC § 1-303(b) as "a
sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ."
Because the UCC's parol evidence rule explicitly allows for the admission of course-of-dealing evidence to
explain or supplement a final written agreement, the evidence is admissible.  

D is correct. Under UCC § 1-303(b), course of dealing is defined as "a sequence of conduct concerning
previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ." In this case, on several past

contract that they had used a number of times in the past. The contract stated that payment was due 30 days
after delivery and provided that the writing contained the complete and exclusive statement of the parties'
agreement.  

On several past occasions, the buyer had taken a 5% discount from the contract price when paying within 10
days of delivery, and the seller had not objected. On this occasion, when the buyer took a 5% discount for
paying within 10 days, the seller objected because his profit margin on this particular machine was smaller
than on his other machines.  

If the seller sues the buyer for breach of contract, may the buyer introduce evidence that the 5% discount was
a term of the agreement? 

A: No, because the seller timely objected to the buyer's proposal for different terms.
B: No, because the writing contained the complete and exclusive agreement of the parties.
C: Yes, because a modification made in good faith does not require consideration.
D: Yes, because evidence of course of dealing is admissible even if the writing contains the complete and
exclusive agreement of the parties.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Under UCC § 1-303(b), course of dealing is defined as "a sequence of conduct concerning
previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ." In this case, on several past
occasions the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection from the seller, thus establishing a course of
dealing. Given the course of dealing between the parties, the seller's objection to the 5% discount, after the
buyer had acted in accordance with the course of dealing, was ineffective. Under the UCC's parol evidence
rule, course-of-dealing evidence is admissible to explain or supplement a final written agreement.  

B is incorrect. Under UCC § 1-303(b), course of dealing is defined as "a sequence of conduct concerning
previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ." In this case, on several past
occasions the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection from the seller, thus establishing a course of
dealing. Under the UCC's parol evidence rule, course-of-dealing evidence is admissible to explain or
supplement a final written agreement even if the parties intended the agreement to be complete and exclusive.
Accordingly, the course-of-dealing evidence is admissible.  

C is incorrect. UCC Article 2 contains a general rule that a good- faith modification does not require
consideration to be enforceable. However, the enforceability of a modification is not at issue here. The issue
here is whether the UCC's parol evidence rule will preclude the admissibility of evidence of course of dealing.
The facts indicate that in the parties' previous contracts the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection
from the seller. This conduct amounted to a course of dealing that is defined under UCC § 1-303(b) as "a
sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ."
Because the UCC's parol evidence rule explicitly allows for the admission of course-of-dealing evidence to
explain or supplement a final written agreement, the evidence is admissible.  

D is correct. Under UCC § 1-303(b), course of dealing is defined as "a sequence of conduct concerning
previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ." In this case, on several past
occasions the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection from the seller, thus establishing a course of
dealing. Under the UCC's parol evidence rule, course-of-dealing evidence is admissible to explain or
supplement a final written agreement even if the parties intended the agreement to be complete and exclusive.
Accordingly, the course-of-dealing evidence is admissible.

Question 1542 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation

 The question was: 

A buyer purchased a new car from a dealer under a written contract that provided that the price of the car was
$20,000 and that the buyer would receive a "trade-in allowance of $7,000 for the buyer's old car." The old car
had recently been damaged in an accident. The contract contained a merger clause stating: "This writing
constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and there are no other understandings or agreements not set
forth herein." When the buyer took possession of the new car, she delivered the old car to the dealer. At that
time, the dealer claimed that the trade-in allowance included an assignment of the buyer's claim against her
insurance company for damage to the old car. The buyer refused to provide the assignment.  

The dealer sued the buyer to recover the insurance payment. The dealer has offered evidence that the parties
agreed during their negotiations for the new car that the dealer was entitled to the insurance payment.  

Should the court admit this evidence? 

A: No, because the dealer's acceptance of the old car bars any additional claim by the dealer.
B: No, because the merger clause bars any evidence of the parties' prior discussions concerning the trade-in
allowance.
C: Yes, because a merger clause does not bar evidence of fraud.
D: Yes, because the merger clause does not bar evidence to explain what the parties meant by "trade-in
allowance."

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. A buyer's mere acceptance of goods does not waive its potential claims against a seller. The
dispositive issue here is whether the parol evidence rule will allow the proffered evidence. Under that rule, a
merger clause does not conclusively determine that an agreement is completely integrated. Moreover, a
finding that an agreement is completely integrated does not necessarily bar the admission of extrinsic
evidence. Although extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to supplement or contradict the express terms of a
completely integrated agreement, such evidence is admissible to explain the terms of an agreement. In this
case, evidence of the parties' discussions during their negotiations is admissible to aid in explaining whether
they intended "trade-in allowance" to include an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance
company.  

B is incorrect. Under the UCC's parol evidence rule, a merger clause does not conclusively determine that an
agreement is completely integrated. Moreover, a finding that an agreement is completely integrated does not
necessarily bar the admission of extrinsic evidence. Although extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to supplement
or contradict the express terms of a completely integrated agreement, such evidence is admissible to explain
the terms of an agreement. In this case, evidence of the parties' discussions during their negotiations is
admissible to aid in explaining whether they intended "trade-in allowance" to include an assignment of the
buyer's claim against her insurance company.  

C is incorrect. The UCC's parol evidence rule allows the introduction of extrinsic evidence to establish fraud
even if an agreement is completely integrated. Because there is no indication of fraud in this case, the fraud
exception is irrelevant. The dispositive issue here is whether the parol evidence rule will allow the proffered
evidence. Under that rule, a merger clause does not conclusively determine that an agreement is completely
integrated. Moreover, a finding that an agreement is completely integrated does not necessarily bar the
admission of extrinsic evidence. Although extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to supplement or contradict the

Question 1548 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A buyer agreed in writing to purchase a car from a seller for $15,000, with the price to be paid on a specified
date at the seller's showroom. The contract provided, and both parties intended, that time was of the essence.
Before the specified date, however, the seller sold the car to a third party for $20,000. On the specified date,
the buyer arrived at the showroom but brought only $10,000. When the seller did not appear at the showroom,
the buyer called the seller and asked whether the seller would accept $10,000 for the car immediately and the
remaining $5,000 in six weeks. The seller told the buyer that he had sold the car to the third party.  

If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract, will the buyer be likely to prevail? 

A: No, because the contractual obligations were discharged on the ground of impossibility.
B: No, because the buyer was not prepared to tender her performance on the specified date.
C: Yes, because the buyer's breach was not material.
D: Yes, because the seller anticipatorily repudiated the contract when he sold the car to the third party.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. While the seller's sale of the car to a third party rendered it impossible for the seller to sell the
car to the buyer, such conduct does not meet the standard to establish impossibility as a legal defense for
nonperformance. Similarly, the buyer's tender of less than the full payment does not, without more, establish a
legal basis for impossibility. The dispositive issue here relates to the effect of neither party tendering
performance on the date specified in the contract. Under UCC Article 2, a seller's tender of delivery of goods
and a buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the seller
were obligated to simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was prepared to
tender performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's performance obligation
was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of contract.  

B is correct. Even though the facts demonstrate that the seller repudiated the contract by selling the car to a
third party, the seller did not end up breaching the contract. Under UCC Article 2, a seller's tender of delivery of
goods and a buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the
seller were obligated to simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was
prepared to tender performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's
performance obligation was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of
contract.  

C is incorrect. UCC Article 2 adopts the perfect tender rule, rather than the material breach rule, as the
generally applicable standard. The dispositive issue here relates to the effect of neither party tendering
performance on the date specified in the contract. Under Article 2, a seller's tender of delivery of goods and a
buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the seller were
obligated to simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was prepared to
tender performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's performance obligation
was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of contract.  

D is incorrect. While the seller's sale of the car to a third party would seem to constitute an anticipatory
repudiation, as it turned out, neither party was prepared to tender performance at the time or in the manner
specified in the contract. UCC Article 2 provides that a seller's tender of delivery of goods and a buyer's tender
of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the seller were obligated to
simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was prepared to tender
performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's performance obligation was

performance obligation was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of

C is incorrect. UCC Article 2 adopts the perfect tender rule, rather than the material breach rule, as the
generally applicable standard. The dispositive issue here relates to the effect of neither party tendering
performance on the date specified in the contract. Under Article 2, a seller's tender of delivery of goods and a
buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the seller were

D is incorrect. While the seller's sale of the car to a third party would seem to constitute an anticipatory
repudiation, as it turned out, neither party was prepared to tender performance at the time or in the manner
specified in the contract. UCC Article 2 provides that a seller's tender of delivery of goods and a buyer's tender

Question 1548 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A buyer agreed in writing to purchase a car from a seller for $15,000, with the price to be paid on a specified
date at the seller's showroom. The contract provided, and both parties intended, that time was of the essence.
Before the specified date, however, the seller sold the car to a third party for $20,000. On the specified date,
the buyer arrived at the showroom but brought only $10,000. When the seller did not appear at the showroom,
the buyer called the seller and asked whether the seller would accept $10,000 for the car immediately and the
remaining $5,000 in six weeks. The seller told the buyer that he had sold the car to the third party.  

If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract, will the buyer be likely to prevail? 

A: No, because the contractual obligations were discharged on the ground of impossibility.
B: No, because the buyer was not prepared to tender her performance on the specified date.
C: Yes, because the buyer's breach was not material.
D: Yes, because the seller anticipatorily repudiated the contract when he sold the car to the third party.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. While the seller's sale of the car to a third party rendered it impossible for the seller to sell the
car to the buyer, such conduct does not meet the standard to establish impossibility as a legal defense for
nonperformance. Similarly, the buyer's tender of less than the full payment does not, without more, establish a
legal basis for impossibility. The dispositive issue here relates to the effect of neither party tendering
performance on the date specified in the contract. Under UCC Article 2, a seller's tender of delivery of goods
and a buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the seller
were obligated to simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was prepared to
tender performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's performance obligation
was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of contract.  

B is correct. Even though the facts demonstrate that the seller repudiated the contract by selling the car to a
third party, the seller did not end up breaching the contract. Under UCC Article 2, a seller's tender of delivery of
goods and a buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the
seller were obligated to simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was
prepared to tender performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's
performance obligation was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of
contract.  

C is incorrect. UCC Article 2 adopts the perfect tender rule, rather than the material breach rule, as the

Question 1557 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A mill and a bakery entered into a written contract that obligated the mill to deliver to the bakery 1,000 pounds
of flour every Monday for 26 weeks at a specified price per pound. The mill delivered the proper quantity of
flour in a timely manner for the first 15 weeks. However, the 16th delivery was tendered on a Tuesday, and
amounted to only 800 pounds. The mill told the bakery that the 200-pound shortage would be made up on the
delivery due the following Monday. The late delivery and the 200-pound shortage will not significantly disrupt
the bakery's operations.  

How may the bakery legally respond to the nonconforming tender? 

A: Accept the 800 pounds tendered, but notify the mill that the bakery will cancel the contract if the exact
amount is not delivered on the following Monday.
B: Accept the 800 pounds tendered, but notify the mill that the bakery will deduct from the price any damages
for losses due to the nonconforming tender.
C: Reject the 800 pounds tendered, but notify the mill that the bakery will accept delivery the following Monday
if it is conforming.
D: Reject the 800 pounds tendered, and notify the mill that the bakery is canceling the contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Because the contract authorizes the delivery of flour in separate lots to be separately accepted,
the parties entered into an installment contract. UCC § 2-612 adopts a "substantial impairment" standard for
determining whether a buyer can reject a particular installment or cancel the entire contract. A buyer can reject
an installment if a nonconformity substantially impairs that installment and the nonconformity cannot be cured.
A buyer can cancel the contract only when the nonconformity with respect to one or more installments
substantially impairs the value of the whole contract. Here, the mill's tender of less than the contracted-for
quantity did not amount to a nonconformity that substantially impaired the value of either the 16th installment
or the whole contract. The mill's proposed cure, the delivery of the remaining 200 pounds on the following
Monday, is sufficient given that the late delivery and the shortage will not significantly disrupt the bakery's
business. Accordingly, not only must the bakery accept the delivery of the tendered 800 pounds of flour, it also
must accept the remaining 200 pounds that the mill proposes to deliver on the following Monday.  

B is correct. Because the contract authorizes the delivery of flour in separate lots to be separately accepted,
the parties entered into an installment contract. UCC § 2-612 adopts a "substantial impairment" standard for

flour in a timely manner for the first 15 weeks. However, the 16th delivery was tendered on a Tuesday, and
amounted to only 800 pounds. The mill told the bakery that the 200-pound shortage would be made up on the
delivery due the following Monday. The late delivery and the 200-pound shortage will not significantly disrupt
the bakery's operations.  

How may the bakery legally respond to the nonconforming tender? 

A: Accept the 800 pounds tendered, but notify the mill that the bakery will cancel the contract if the exact
amount is not delivered on the following Monday.
B: Accept the 800 pounds tendered, but notify the mill that the bakery will deduct from the price any damages
for losses due to the nonconforming tender.
C: Reject the 800 pounds tendered, but notify the mill that the bakery will accept delivery the following Monday
if it is conforming.
D: Reject the 800 pounds tendered, and notify the mill that the bakery is canceling the contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. Because the contract authorizes the delivery of flour in separate lots to be separately accepted,
the parties entered into an installment contract. UCC § 2-612 adopts a "substantial impairment" standard for
determining whether a buyer can reject a particular installment or cancel the entire contract. A buyer can reject
an installment if a nonconformity substantially impairs that installment and the nonconformity cannot be cured.
A buyer can cancel the contract only when the nonconformity with respect to one or more installments
substantially impairs the value of the whole contract. Here, the mill's tender of less than the contracted-for
quantity did not amount to a nonconformity that substantially impaired the value of either the 16th installment
or the whole contract. The mill's proposed cure, the delivery of the remaining 200 pounds on the following
Monday, is sufficient given that the late delivery and the shortage will not significantly disrupt the bakery's
business. Accordingly, not only must the bakery accept the delivery of the tendered 800 pounds of flour, it also
must accept the remaining 200 pounds that the mill proposes to deliver on the following Monday.  

B is correct. Because the contract authorizes the delivery of flour in separate lots to be separately accepted,

an installment if a nonconformity substantially impairs that installment and the nonconformity cannot be cured.
Additionally, a buyer can cancel the contract only when the nonconformity with respect to one or more

Question 1561 - Contracts - Conditions

 The question was: 

A buyer agreed to purchase a seller's house for $250,000 "on condition that the buyer obtain mortgage
financing within 30 days." Thirty days later, the buyer told the seller that the buyer would not purchase the
house because the buyer had not obtained mortgage financing. The seller asked the buyer where the buyer
had tried to obtain mortgage financing, and the buyer responded, "I was busy and didn't have time to seek
mortgage financing."  

If the seller sues the buyer for breach of contract, is the court likely to find the buyer in breach? 

A: No, because the buyer's performance was subject to a condition that did not occur.
B: No, because the promise was illusory since the buyer was not obligated to do anything.
C: Yes, because a promise was implied that the buyer had to make reasonable efforts to obtain mortgage
financing.
D: Yes, because a reasonable interpretation of the agreement is that the buyer had an obligation to purchase
the house for $250,000 in 30 days.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. A performance that is subject to an express condition cannot become due unless the condition
occurs or its non-occurrence is excused. However, the duty of good faith, which is implied in every contract,
imposed an obligation on the buyer to make reasonable efforts to secure mortgage financing. Because the
buyer made no such efforts, the non-occurrence of the condition to the buyer's obligation to purchase the
house--the buyer's securing financing--was excused. Accordingly, the court is likely to find that the buyer is in
breach.  

B is incorrect. The duty of good faith, which is implied in every contract, imposed an obligation on the buyer to
make reasonable efforts to secure mortgage financing. Accordingly, the buyer's promise to secure financing
was not illusory. A performance that is subject to an express condition cannot become due unless the
condition occurs or its non-occurrence is excused. In this case, the non-occurrence of the condition to the
buyer's obligation to perform was excused, because the buyer failed to make reasonable efforts to secure
mortgage financing. Therefore, the court is likely to find that the buyer is in breach.  

C is correct. A performance that is subject to an express condition cannot become due unless the condition
occurs or its non-occurrence is excused. However, the duty of good faith, which is implied in every contract,
imposed an obligation on the buyer to make reasonable efforts to secure mortgage financing. Because the
buyer made no such efforts, the non-occurrence of the condition to the buyer's obligation to purchase the
house--the buyer's securing financing--was excused. Accordingly, the court is likely to find that the buyer is in
breach.  

D is incorrect. The contract explicitly stated that the buyer's obligation to perform was expressly conditioned on
the buyer obtaining mortgage financing. A performance that is subject to an express condition cannot become
due unless the condition occurs or its non-occurrence is excused. However, the duty of good faith, which is
implied in every contract, imposed an obligation on the buyer to make reasonable efforts to secure mortgage
financing. Because the buyer made no such efforts, the non-occurrence of the condition to the buyer's
obligation to purchase the house--the buyer's securing financing--was excused. Accordingly, the court is likely
to find that the buyer is in breach.

Question 1566 - Contracts - Discharge of Contractual Duties

 The question was: 

A producer contracted to pay an inexperienced performer a specified salary to act in a small role in a play the
producer was taking on a six-week road tour. The contract was for the duration of the tour. On the third day of
the tour, the performer was hospitalized with a stomach disorder. The producer replaced her in the cast with
an experienced actor. One week later, the performer recovered, but the producer refused to allow her to
resume her original role for the remainder of the tour.  

In an action by the performer against the producer for breach of contract, which of the following, if proved,
would be the producer's best defense? 

A: The actor, by general acclaim, was much better in the role than the performer had been.
B: The actor was the only replacement the producer could find, and the actor would accept nothing less than a
contract for the remainder of the six-week tour.
C: The producer offered to employ the performer as the actor's understudy for the remainder of the six-week
tour at the performer's original salary, but the performer declined.
D: Both the producer and the performer knew that a year earlier the performer had been incapacitated for a
short period of time by the same kind of stomach disorder.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. After the performer became ill, the temporary impracticability doctrine excused the performer's
contractual obligation and also gave the producer the right to suspend his performance obligation during the
period that the performer's illness prevented her from acting. The critical issue here is whether the producer
also had the right to cancel the contract. Circumstances that would give the producer the right to cancel
include the degree of uncertainty relating to the nature and duration of the performer's illness and the extent to
which a delay in making substitute arrangements would have prevented the producer from continuing the tour.
The relative quality of the actor's performance is not a circumstance that would give the producer the right to
cancel the performer's contract.

contractual obligation and also gave the producer the right to suspend his performance obligation during the

remainder of the six-week tour and the uncertainty surrounding when the performer might return to work would
have discharged the producer's performance obligations and justified his cancellation of the contract with the

B: The actor was the only replacement the producer could find, and the actor would accept nothing less than a
contract for the remainder of the six-week tour.
C: The producer offered to employ the performer as the actor's understudy for the remainder of the six-week
tour at the performer's original salary, but the performer declined.
D: Both the producer and the performer knew that a year earlier the performer had been incapacitated for a
short period of time by the same kind of stomach disorder.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. After the performer became ill, the temporary impracticability doctrine excused the performer's
contractual obligation and also gave the producer the right to suspend his performance obligation during the
period that the performer's illness prevented her from acting. The critical issue here is whether the producer
also had the right to cancel the contract. Circumstances that would give the producer the right to cancel
include the degree of uncertainty relating to the nature and duration of the performer's illness and the extent to
which a delay in making substitute arrangements would have prevented the producer from continuing the tour.
The relative quality of the actor's performance is not a circumstance that would give the producer the right to
cancel the performer's contract.  

B is correct. After the performer became ill, the temporary impracticability doctrine excused the performer's
contractual obligation and also gave the producer the right to suspend his performance obligation during the
period that the performer's illness prevented her from acting. The critical issue here is whether the producer
also had the right to cancel the contract. Circumstances that would give the producer the right to cancel the
contract include the degree of uncertainty relating to the nature and duration of the performer's illness and the
extent to which a delay in making substitute arrangements would have prevented the producer from continuing
the tour. The unwillingness of the actor, the only replacement available, to take a contract for less than the
remainder of the six-week tour and the uncertainty surrounding when the performer might return to work would
have discharged the producer's performance obligations and justified his cancellation of the contract with the
performer.  

C is incorrect. After the performer became ill, the temporary impracticability doctrine excused the performer's
contractual obligation and also gave the producer the right to suspend his performance obligation during the
period that the performer's illness prevented her from acting. The critical issue here is whether the producer
also had the right to cancel the contract. Circumstances that would give the producer the right to cancel
include the degree of uncertainty relating to the nature and duration of the performer's illness and the extent to
which a delay in making substitute arrangements would have prevented the producer from continuing the tour.
Because the producer had the right to cancel the contract, his action in offering the performer a job as
understudy is irrelevant.  

D is incorrect. After the performer became ill, the temporary impracticability doctrine excused the performer's
contractual obligation and also gave the producer the right to suspend his performance obligation during the

Question 1566 - Contracts - Discharge of Contractual Duties

A history of having been ill for a short time would not justify the producer's cancellation of the contract. In fact,
the short period of time that the performer had been incapacitated a year earlier from the same illness would
weaken the producer's defense.

Question 1566 - Contracts - Discharge of Contractual Duties

 The question was: 

A producer contracted to pay an inexperienced performer a specified salary to act in a small role in a play the
producer was taking on a six-week road tour. The contract was for the duration of the tour. On the third day of
the tour, the performer was hospitalized with a stomach disorder. The producer replaced her in the cast with
an experienced actor. One week later, the performer recovered, but the producer refused to allow her to
resume her original role for the remainder of the tour.  

In an action by the performer against the producer for breach of contract, which of the following, if proved,
would be the producer's best defense? 

A: The actor, by general acclaim, was much better in the role than the performer had been.
B: The actor was the only replacement the producer could find, and the actor would accept nothing less than a
contract for the remainder of the six-week tour.

Question 1571 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

An art collector paid a gallery $1,000 to purchase a framed drawing from the gallery's collection. The price
included shipping by the gallery to the collector's home. The gallery's owner used inadequate materials to wrap
the drawing. The frame broke during shipment and scratched the drawing, reducing the drawing's value to
$300. The collector complained to the gallery owner, who told the collector to take the drawing to a specific art
restorer to have the drawing repaired. The collector paid the restorer $400 to repair the drawing, but not all of
the scratches could be fixed. The drawing, after being repaired, was worth $700. The gallery owner
subsequently refused to pay either for the repairs or for the damage to the drawing.  

In an action by the collector against the gallery owner for damages, which of the following awards is most
likely? 

A: Nothing.
B: $300.
C: $400.
D: $700.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The gallery's use of inadequate materials to wrap the drawing constituted a breach of warranty.
Therefore, the collector is entitled to be placed in the position he would have been in but for the gallery's
breach. Awarding the collector nothing would violate the expectation damages principle. Under UCC §
2-714(2), the generally applicable standard for measuring the collector's resulting damages would be the
difference between the value of the drawing as accepted and the value of the drawing if it had been as
warranted. Repair costs often are used to determine this difference in value, but when repairs fail to restore the
goods to their value as warranted, an adjustment is required. The collector is entitled to recover the repair
costs ($400) plus the difference between the value of the drawing if it had been as warranted and its value
after the repairs ($1,000 - $700 = $300). Accordingly, the collector should recover $700.  

B is incorrect. The gallery's use of inadequate materials to wrap the drawing constituted a breach of warranty.
Therefore, the collector is entitled to be placed in the position he would have been in but for the gallery's
breach. Awarding the collector $300 would violate the expectation damages principle. Under UCC § 2-714(2),

($400) plus the difference between the value of the drawing if it had been as warranted and its value after the
repairs ($1,000 - $700 = $300). Accordingly, the collector should recover $700.

Question 1578 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A businesswoman sold her business to a company for $25 million in cash pursuant to a written contract that
was signed by both parties. Under the contract, the company agreed to employ the businesswoman for two
years as a vice president at a salary of $150,000 per year. After six months, the company, without cause, fired
the businesswoman.  

Which of the following statements best describes the businesswoman's rights after the discharge?  

A: She can recover the promised salary for the remainder of the two years if she remains ready to work.
B: She can recover the promised salary for the remainder of the two years if no comparable job is reasonably
available and she does not take another job.
C: She can rescind the contract of sale and get back her business upon tender to the company of $25 million.
D: She can get specific performance of her right to serve as a vice president of the company for two years.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The company's unjustified termination of the businesswoman's employment constituted a
breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. However, a wrongfully
discharged employee is expected to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to seek comparable
employment. In this case, to avoid a reduction in her damages, the businesswoman is required to do more
than remain ready to work. Her recovery will be reduced by the compensation she earned or could have
earned if she had made reasonable efforts to secure comparable employment.  

B is correct. The company's unjustified termination of the businesswoman's employment constituted a breach
of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. A wrongfully discharged employee is
expected to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to seek comparable employment. However, if no
comparable employment is reasonably available and the businesswoman does not take another job, the
businesswoman is entitled to recover the promised salary for the remainder of the two years.  

C is incorrect. The company's unjustified termination of the businesswoman's employment constituted a
material breach of contract. Nevertheless, a court would likely employ the concept of divisibility to preclude the
businesswoman from rescinding the contract of sale. As stated in Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 240, a
contract is divisible where "the performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises can be
apportioned into corresponding pairs of part performances so that the parts of each pair are properly regarded
as agreed equivalents." Here, the agreed equivalents would be the sale of the business and the corresponding
$25 million purchase price, and the businesswoman's promise to work for the company and the corresponding
yearly salary of $150,000. Applying this concept, the businesswoman would be able to recover damages for
the company's breach of its promise to employ her, but she would not be permitted to rescind the contract of
sale.  

D is incorrect. The company's unjustified termination of the businesswoman's employment constituted a
breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. The general rule is that
employers cannot obtain specific performance requiring an employee who has breached a personal services
contract to work for the employer. It is also true generally that courts refuse to grant specific performance of an
employment contract against a breaching employer. Consequently, the businesswoman's recovery will consist
of the unpaid salary under the contract, reduced by the compensation she earned or could have earned if she
had made reasonable efforts to secure comparable employment.

Question 1581 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

On June 15, a teacher accepted a contract for a one-year position teaching math at a public high school at a
salary of $50,000, starting in September. On June 22, the school informed the teacher that, due to a change in
its planned math curriculum, it no longer needed a full-time math teacher. The school offered instead to
employ the teacher as a part-time academic counselor at a salary of $20,000, starting in September. The
teacher refused the school's offer. On June 29, the teacher was offered a one-year position to teach math at a
nearby private academy for $47,000, starting in September. The teacher, however, decided to spend the year
completing work on a graduate degree in mathematics and declined the academy's offer.  

If the teacher sues the school for breach of contract, what is her most likely recovery? 

A: $50,000, the full contract amount.
B: $30,000, the full contract amount less the amount the teacher could have earned in the counselor position
offered by the school.
C: $3,000, the full contract amount less the amount the teacher could have earned in the teaching position at
the academy.
D: Nothing, because the school notified the teacher of its decision before the teacher had acted in substantial
reliance on the contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The teacher is entitled to recover damages that will place her in the position she would have
been in but for the school's breach. However, an injured party is expected to make reasonable efforts to
mitigate the loss resulting from the other party's breach. In the case of a wrongfully discharged employee, the
employee is expected to accept an offer of comparable employment. If the employee fails or refuses to do so,
the employee's recovery is reduced by the amount of the loss that the employee could have avoided by
accepting comparable employment. Here, the teacher's damages of $50,000 should be reduced by the
$47,000 she would have earned if she had accepted the comparable teaching position at the private academy.
Therefore, the teacher is entitled to recover $3,000 from the school.  

B is incorrect. The teacher is entitled to recover damages that will place her in the position she would have
been in but for the school's breach. However, an injured party is expected to make reasonable efforts to
mitigate the loss resulting from the other party's breach. In the case of a wrongfully discharged employee, the
employee is expected to accept an offer of comparable employment. If the employee fails or refuses to do so,
the employee's recovery is reduced by the amount of the loss that the employee could have avoided by
accepting comparable employment. Because it is unlikely that a court would consider the counseling position
to be comparable employment, the teacher's damages should not be reduced by the $20,000 she would have
earned if she had accepted that position. On the other hand, her damages of $50,000 should be reduced by
the $47,000 she would have earned if she had accepted the comparable teaching position at the private
academy. Therefore, the teacher is entitled to recover $3,000 from the school.  

C is correct. The teacher is entitled to recover damages that will place her in the position she would have been
in but for the school's breach. However, an injured party is expected to make reasonable efforts to mitigate the
loss resulting from the other party's breach. In the case of a wrongfully discharged employee, the employee is

would have earned if she had accepted the comparable teaching position at the private academy. Therefore,
the teacher is entitled to recover $3,000 from the school.  

D is incorrect. The teacher and the school entered into an enforceable contract, and the school's unjustified
nonperformance constituted a breach of contract. The teacher is therefore entitled to recover damages that will
place her in the position she would have been in but for the breach and need not show reliance in order to
recover. However, while she is entitled to damages from the breach, an injured party is expected to make
reasonable efforts to mitigate the loss resulting from the other party's breach. In the case of a wrongfully

employee fails or refuses to do so, the employee's recovery is reduced by the amount of the loss that the
employee could have avoided by accepting comparable employment. Here, the teacher's damages of $50,000
should be reduced by the $47,000 she would have earned if she had accepted the comparable teaching
position at the private academy. Therefore, the teacher is entitled to recover $3,000 from the school.

Question 1581 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

On June 15, a teacher accepted a contract for a one-year position teaching math at a public high school at a
salary of $50,000, starting in September. On June 22, the school informed the teacher that, due to a change in
its planned math curriculum, it no longer needed a full-time math teacher. The school offered instead to
employ the teacher as a part-time academic counselor at a salary of $20,000, starting in September. The
teacher refused the school's offer. On June 29, the teacher was offered a one-year position to teach math at a
nearby private academy for $47,000, starting in September. The teacher, however, decided to spend the year
completing work on a graduate degree in mathematics and declined the academy's offer.  

If the teacher sues the school for breach of contract, what is her most likely recovery? 

A: $50,000, the full contract amount.
B: $30,000, the full contract amount less the amount the teacher could have earned in the counselor position
offered by the school.
C: $3,000, the full contract amount less the amount the teacher could have earned in the teaching position at
the academy.
D: Nothing, because the school notified the teacher of its decision before the teacher had acted in substantial
reliance on the contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The teacher is entitled to recover damages that will place her in the position she would have
been in but for the school's breach. However, an injured party is expected to make reasonable efforts to
mitigate the loss resulting from the other party's breach. In the case of a wrongfully discharged employee, the
employee is expected to accept an offer of comparable employment. If the employee fails or refuses to do so,
the employee's recovery is reduced by the amount of the loss that the employee could have avoided by
accepting comparable employment. Here, the teacher's damages of $50,000 should be reduced by the
$47,000 she would have earned if she had accepted the comparable teaching position at the private academy.
Therefore, the teacher is entitled to recover $3,000 from the school.  

B is incorrect. The teacher is entitled to recover damages that will place her in the position she would have
been in but for the school's breach. However, an injured party is expected to make reasonable efforts to
mitigate the loss resulting from the other party's breach. In the case of a wrongfully discharged employee, the
employee is expected to accept an offer of comparable employment. If the employee fails or refuses to do so,
the employee's recovery is reduced by the amount of the loss that the employee could have avoided by
accepting comparable employment. Because it is unlikely that a court would consider the counseling position
to be comparable employment, the teacher's damages should not be reduced by the $20,000 she would have
earned if she had accepted that position. On the other hand, her damages of $50,000 should be reduced by
the $47,000 she would have earned if she had accepted the comparable teaching position at the private
academy. Therefore, the teacher is entitled to recover $3,000 from the school.  

C is correct. The teacher is entitled to recover damages that will place her in the position she would have been

would have earned if she had accepted the comparable teaching position at the private academy. Therefore,
the teacher is entitled to recover $3,000 from the school.  

D is incorrect. The teacher and the school entered into an enforceable contract, and the school's unjustified
nonperformance constituted a breach of contract. The teacher is therefore entitled to recover damages that will
place her in the position she would have been in but for the breach and need not show reliance in order to
recover. However, while she is entitled to damages from the breach, an injured party is expected to make

Question 1586 - Contracts - Remedies

 The question was: 

A produce distributor contracted to provide a grocer with eight crates of lettuce at the distributor's listed price.
The distributor's shipping clerk mistakenly shipped only seven crates to the grocer. The grocer accepted
delivery of the seven crates but immediately notified the distributor that the delivery did not conform to the
contract. The distributor's listed price for seven crates of lettuce was 7/8 of its listed price for eight crates. The
distributor shipped no more lettuce to the grocer, and the grocer has not yet paid for any of the lettuce.  

How much, if anything, is the distributor entitled to collect from the grocer? 

A: Nothing, because the tender of all eight crates was a condition precedent to the grocer's duty to pay.
B: The reasonable value of the seven crates of lettuce, minus the grocer's damages, if any, for the distributor's
failure to deliver the full order.
C: The listed price for the seven crates of lettuce, minus the grocer's damages, if any, for the distributor's
failure to deliver the full order.
D: The listed price for the seven crates of lettuce.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The distributor's nonconforming shipment constituted both an acceptance of the grocer's offer to
purchase and a breach of the parties' contract. With respect to a nonconforming tender, UCC § 2-601 allows a
buyer to accept the whole, reject the whole, or partially accept or reject commercial units. A buyer who accepts
a tender of goods, whether conforming or nonconforming, becomes obligated to pay the seller the contract
price of the goods. Accordingly, the grocer's acceptance of the nonconforming shipment obligated it to pay the
distributor's listed price for the seven crates, reduced by any damages for losses resulting from the
nonconforming shipment.  

B is incorrect. The distributor's nonconforming shipment constituted both an acceptance of the grocer's offer to
purchase and a breach of the parties' contract. With respect to a nonconforming tender, UCC § 2-601 allows a
buyer to accept the whole, reject the whole, or partially accept or reject commercial units. A buyer who accepts
a tender of goods, whether conforming or nonconforming, becomes obligated to pay the seller the contract
price of the goods. Accordingly, the grocer's acceptance of the nonconforming shipment obligated it to pay the
distributor's listed price for, rather than the reasonable value of, the seven crates of lettuce. The price paid by
the grocer will be reduced by any damages for losses resulting from the nonconforming shipment.  

C is correct. The distributor's nonconforming shipment constituted both an acceptance of the grocer's offer to
purchase and a breach of the parties' contract. With respect to a nonconforming tender, UCC § 2-601 allows a
buyer to accept the whole, reject the whole, or partially accept or reject commercial units. A buyer who accepts

Question 1587 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

A seller borrowed $5,000 from a bank. Soon thereafter the seller filed for bankruptcy, having paid nothing on
his debt to the bank.  

Five years after the debt had been discharged in bankruptcy, the seller contracted to sell certain goods to a
buyer for $5,000. The contract provided that the buyer would pay the $5,000 to the bank "as payment of the
$5,000 the seller owes the bank." The only debt that the seller ever owed the bank is the $5,000 debt that was
discharged in bankruptcy. The seller delivered the goods to the buyer, who accepted them.  

If the bank becomes aware of the contract between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer refuses to pay
anything to the bank, is the bank likely to succeed in an action against the buyer for $5,000? 

A: No, because the buyer's promise to pay the bank was not supported by consideration.
B: No, because the seller's debt was discharged in bankruptcy.
C: Yes, because the bank was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the buyer and the seller.
D: Yes, because no consideration is required to support a promise to pay a debt that has been discharged in
bankruptcy.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The buyer and the seller entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and purchase of
goods. Thus their agreement was supported by consideration. Moreover, a promisee (the seller) can intend
that a third party be the beneficiary of the performance the promisee expects to receive from a promisor (the
buyer). Because the parties' agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the
buyer had promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement
between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank.  

B is incorrect. The bank was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the buyer and the seller, and the
fact of discharge is irrelevant. The seller and the buyer entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and
purchase of goods. Because their agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that
the buyer had promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable
agreement between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank.  

C is correct. The buyer and the seller entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and purchase of
goods. Because their agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the buyer had
promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement between
the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank.  

D is incorrect. It is true that a promise by a debtor to pay a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy
requires no consideration to be enforceable. In this case, however, the discharge of the seller's debt is
irrelevant. Here, the seller and the buyer entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and purchase of
goods. Because their agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the buyer had
promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement between
the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank.

A is incorrect. The buyer and the seller entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and purchase of
goods. Thus their agreement was supported by consideration. Moreover, a promisee (the seller) can intend
that a third party be the beneficiary of the performance the promisee expects to receive from a promisor (the
buyer). Because the parties' agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the
buyer had promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement
between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank.  

B is incorrect. The bank was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the buyer and the seller, and the
fact of discharge is irrelevant. The seller and the buyer entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and
purchase of goods. Because their agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that
the buyer had promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable
agreement between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank.  

C is correct. The buyer and the seller entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and purchase of
goods. Because their agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the buyer had
promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement between
the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank.  

D is incorrect. It is true that a promise by a debtor to pay a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy
requires no consideration to be enforceable. In this case, however, the discharge of the seller's debt is
irrelevant. Here, the seller and the buyer entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and purchase of
goods. Because their agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the buyer had
promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement between
the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank.

Question 1587 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights

 The question was: 

A seller borrowed $5,000 from a bank. Soon thereafter the seller filed for bankruptcy, having paid nothing on
his debt to the bank.  

Five years after the debt had been discharged in bankruptcy, the seller contracted to sell certain goods to a
buyer for $5,000. The contract provided that the buyer would pay the $5,000 to the bank "as payment of the
$5,000 the seller owes the bank." The only debt that the seller ever owed the bank is the $5,000 debt that was
discharged in bankruptcy. The seller delivered the goods to the buyer, who accepted them.  

If the bank becomes aware of the contract between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer refuses to pay
anything to the bank, is the bank likely to succeed in an action against the buyer for $5,000? 

A: No, because the buyer's promise to pay the bank was not supported by consideration.
B: No, because the seller's debt was discharged in bankruptcy.
C: Yes, because the bank was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the buyer and the seller.
D: Yes, because no consideration is required to support a promise to pay a debt that has been discharged in
bankruptcy.

Question 1593 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties

 The question was: 

A builder borrowed $10,000 from a lender to finance a small construction job under a contract with a
homeowner. The builder gave the lender a writing that stated, "Any money I receive from the homeowner will
be paid immediately to the lender, regardless of any demands from other creditors." The builder died after
completing the job but before the homeowner paid. The lender demanded that the homeowner pay the
$10,000 due to the builder directly to the lender. The homeowner refused, saying that he would pay directly to
the builder's estate everything that he owed the builder.  

Is the lender likely to succeed in an action against the homeowner for $10,000? 

A: No, because the builder's death terminated the lender's right to receive payment directly from the
homeowner.
B: No, because the writing the builder gave to the lender did not transfer to the lender the right to receive
payment from the homeowner.
C: Yes, because the builder had manifested an intent that the homeowner pay the $10,000 directly to the
lender.
D: Yes, because the lender is an intended beneficiary of the builder-homeowner contract.

The explanation for the answer is:

A is incorrect. The builder never gave the lender a valid assignment. An assignment arises when the holder of
a right, an obligee, manifests the intent to make a present transfer of that right to another, the assignee. An
assignment is to be distinguished from a promise to do something in the future, such as the payment of
money. Here, the writing in which the builder promised to pay the lender the $10,000 he received from the
homeowner did not transfer to the lender the right to receive payment directly from the homeowner, and thus it
did not create an assignment.  

B is correct. An assignment arises when the holder of a right, an obligee, manifests the intent to make a
present transfer of that right to another, the assignee. Upon an assignment, the assignor's rights are
extinguished and transferred to the assignee. An assignment is to be distinguished from a promise to do
something in the future, such as the payment of money. Here, the writing in which the builder promised to pay
the lender the $10,000 he received from the homeowner did not transfer to the lender the right to receive
payment directly from the homeowner, and thus it did not create an assignment.  

C is incorrect. It may have been the builder's subjective intent to have the homeowner pay the $10,000 directly
to the lender if the builder died, but more was required in order for the lender to have the right to receive that
direct payment. The dispositive issue here is whether the builder gave the lender a valid assignment. An

$10,000 he received from the homeowner did not transfer to the lender the right to receive payment directly

between the builder and the homeowner, the lender did not acquire third-party beneficiary status. The

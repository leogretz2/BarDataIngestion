THE RULES OFTHE ROAD- AN INTRODUCTION TO THE
MULnSTATE METHOD

A~ we tral'c1ed dOI\ n the ro.1d of higher education. each milc\tonc had a cryptic
name ~ the PSAT. the SAT. Hnd the LSAT. among others. Ahhough each slIcces 
~ive exam ~eemed 10 imimidmc morc thim the 111~1, with some determination. we
arrive at the ultimate milestone - the Mullislalc Bar Ex'lIliination. or M BE.

Created in 1972 by the National Conference of BlIf EX,lmincrs (or NCBE). in
cooperation with lhe Edul:atlonal Testing Service, the MBE is a full-duy. 200 
(IUCslion. mind numbing. IllUll1plc choice c,<am. One hundred questions are ud 
mini\lcrcd. randomly us to subjCd arC,I, in two three-hour testing Icssion'. The
exam secb to cover a brC<ldth of subjects th,ll \\ould be impossible 10 cover in a
few sclccll-d eSlays.

The MBE ha.. become the !.tandard for most multiple choice eX<lm, that -.eek to
tc~l on legal reasoning ~kills. <1-.. well a~ familiarity with generally alTepte<l legal
principle... Pre'Clllly. it covers the "even core areas of TOrl"_ Criminal L<lW and
Procedure. COlllrads. Real Property. Constitutional La". :Jnd Evidence. A~ consti 
tUled. the MilE i~ a major portion of the bar exam in virtually e\ery jurisdiction.
with Indi'lIla. Louisiana and Washington being the ex.ceptions.

The .\·lBE has also been the model for countless objecthe law school exams. as
well as the California First Year La\\ Student Ex.am administered by the State Bar
(also referred 10 a<, the Baby Bar). Ho\\cver. the MBE is perhaps the most subjec 
tiv(" obj("ctive test e\er created. It attempt.. to te..t those analytical skills that we
h:l\e honed and perfected. or hale attempted to perfect. in the law school class 
room through casc study.

Thi.. introduction will review prep.1ratlOn methods :Jnd offer test-taking technique~
that will also be of value to the I<lw studelll facing objel'tive testing in virtually any
<lrea of the law :Jnd Califomi<l studen1~ preparing for the Bar and/or !:Jaby Bar
Exam. The methodolog) discussed herein can be applied to any tIluhiple choice
testing format that uses the MBE as a mOOe\.

INTRODUCTION: THE RULES OFTHE ROAD II

Thc rc(omllll:nJcd first step i~ to brea" do\\ n each ~ubject area illlo ib componcnt
p,m~ and to ma..,lCr ca(h ofthc~c area~ before moving on to the next, Forcllamplc,
onc cannot Icarn Crime~ without fiht nla~tcringthe general rcquiremcl1t\ of actus
rClIS (the criminal act) and mcns rca (the mental state) before moving on to homi 
cidc and theft nirne~_

While studying the outline materials. ta"e the time to di~cem the nCl.:essary cle 
mcnt~ of ea(h rule revic\\cd. List thc~c elements in your ml11d. on a pien: of p,apcr
or on a fillsh (,ml and then conte~tualize. This means putting the outline aside for
a moment to (onsideror imagine a set offacb that will call up the rule. c1cmcnl or
cll(eption to be applied. For ellample. \>"hile rcvie\\ ing contract offers. consider a
number of situations in which an offer mayor may not exi\t. such as Do you want
10 go to the movies? (merely an inquiry); If you pay for the lllovjcs.I'lI pay for the
food (po..sibly an offer. despite its indefiniteness. if another would be ju\tified in
believing that a power of acceptance has been created); or I'll pay you $5.00 an
hour to come over at 7:00 P.M, this Saturday and watch my kids while I go to the
movies (clearly an offer). If at first this scem~ difficult. there are a number of !lash
card scI',. ~uch as those published by Law-in-a-Flash or P:\1BR th:lIlist e,\ample~
or hypothetical\ that may provc helpful in helping initimc the proce\s.

The ncxt step i~ 10 tum to a source of practice que~tions. such a~ the Finz Multistate
Method book utillzcd by Flcming's Fundamental.. of Law. starting with the table
of contents. You will see. for example. in the Criminal Law M'ction. Ihat following
the heading Gl.'lll.'r:11 PrillI.' ipIes is a Ii ';ti ng of I3 que~t;ons thai lest in IhM spec ifie
area, Wor"ing (IUe~lions in thc sublOpic immediately following ib review will not
only help you place the rules in wntext. i.c.. 10 apply thc rules. it will also ht:lp you
to delermine whether or notthcrc is sufficicnt (omprehcnsion of the rules so as to
allow you 10 move on to the ncxt area of tcsting. Again. it is vital 10 achieve some
sense of mastcry in each area before moving 10 the next.

When taking the practice lest questions. always lime yourself, allowing no more
than 1.8 minutes per que~tion. If you are aware oflhe time pressure from the very
~ginning. then you will start 10 develop a rhythm or an almost instinctive aware 
ne~s of the passage of time as you work Ihe problems.

III INTRODUCnON:THERUlESOFTHEROAD

RULE #3 KEEP l'OUR El'ES ON THE ROAD (or, rile Zen o/resting)

Onc of lhc atlrlbutes of the sun'essful examinee is the ;lbility 10 focus, to the exclu 
sion of ;III ebe, while in testing mode. This can be thought of ;IS finding a quiet pl;lce.
both cxtcrnally and intcrnally. in \\hich 10 perform. Thc distrOlctions mOlY be cxtcr 
nal. such as thc continucd groans of a neighboring test taker: or the distr-J.ctions may
be intcrnal. ,uch OIS wondering what impube possessed you to ,it for the exam.

Thc key is 10 block out evcrythlllg but the h.~,t question. and 10 be able to do lhal for
an cxtcndcd period oftimc. B} doing test questions III h10cb of no less th;lll 17 ;It a
timc, onc half hour per set you can consciously put your"clf in the eJ\am for tl1Ol\
period of Ilmc to Ihc exclusion of all else. Considcr continulllg to praclicc the half
hour scts until you ha\'e mastered the ability to go for thirty minutc, without think 
ing about anythmg but the tc-t questions. Once you have mastered this ability. thcn
expand 10 one hour of testing. or 33 questions, and ,0 on. until you can ,it for thrce
hour., without a significant break in cOllccntmtioll.

Thi, does mean, however. thnt no mallcr how grcm thc tcmptmion, you cannot look
the :m 
at thc an,wer key until you havc completcd thc SCI. Whcn you do rcvic\\
swers. look at the explanation, for both the corrcct and incorrcct rcsponses 10 cnsurc
a well-reasoncd basis for your selections and to reinforce }our grasp of the rule
being tested.

Some students \\iI1 find it hclpful to writc out thc rule on a llash card for those
problems they got wrong. This. again. helps to rcinforcc your grasp of thc rule. will
help you keep track of arcas of difficulty, und \\ill creatc a valuable study tool.

It is also import,lIlt to sit for at least one simulated CJ\::1Il1 so as to tcst your ability to
focus ovcr thc long haul. Use the simulation as an opportunity to diagnosc area, of
wcakIlCs~, not only ~ubstantivel y, bUl leehnieall y or procedurally as \\ ell. i.e .. Docs
the brain complctcly fade somewhere around (IUestion 75? Docs it take 1010 15
qucstions to cSlabhsh a rhythm'! Docs thc bralll think of nothing but lunch as the
dock neaTh the Iloon hour?

As the exam draws nearer. the clllphasis should shift from outlinc rcview 10 problem
,olving. with the outlincs being u"Cd primarily as a refre,hcr or supplemcnt 10 thc
problems, Again. the e:Ulnl is teSling 011 prOblem solving skill-. not thc abill!} to
regurgitate thc black lettcr law. Thc final momh should I'lc dcvoted to doing I>r;lcticc
MBE's.

Re,tding the slem, or glancing allhc <lnswers, 10 C'~tabli~h lhe objcctivc or dlrcctlOn
thc problem is laking will help boost your rcading comprehension, This C,1Il be
comp;rred to using a road map 10 e.,tablish I, hich direClion to take in order 10 reach
your ultim<lle destinalion, I.e., the objcCli\c of 111<: problem.

Re,lding comprehcnsion i, enh<lnccd if you halc a ,cnl>C of dirCClioll, that is. an
ide,. of which facts arc lil..c1y to be importanl and which fact" arc sCi forth as mere

paragruph, will not have a IX"aring on the rc"ult. Parties urc more eusily identified.
is,ues ,m: more e<lsily narrow(-d.

Once Ihe objective has been established. it becomes easier to reeogniLe the detail,
Ilwt may be important in resolving the is~ues presemed. For example, the fact thai
Ihe plaintiff was an amidpmed or known Ircspasscr, and Ihus a duty W;b owed,
nwy he detennilwti\e in Torts; or thm the ~elJcr was an unemployed ballerina, and
Ihus nOI a merchant. may help resolve the issue as 10 whether or not a IHillen
opllon eOll1ract nOI supported by considero.ltion is enforceable: or Ih:1I Ihe seller
was planning 10 sell. mlher thun presemly imending 10 ~cll. may indkme that there
is no offer on which to b..1se a eontrae\.

As indicated above. a fact critical to the OUlcome may be buried within the dctails
of the facl p:lltenl which. in es-.cnce, is idel1licallo the es'ays. The\C details may
be seen in adJccllvcs, verhs, udverbs, times, dates, pl;lces. quotation". personal
ch,lnlcterislics, names, or intelltions. The question 10 ask is: Wh,lt is the ICl.:ul sig 
nificance of each fact or detail as it relates to our inquiry or call of the queslion'?

In some problems, bUI nOI all, a slInple, quidJy executed diagrnnl may be helpful

The areas that are mo~t likely to c<lll on diagramming ski1l~ Ilouid Ix: Contracts
and Real Property. It i~ rccollllllcnded that you practice diagramming, if that tedl 
nique i~ to be employ'cd, wherever <lppropriale in the practice question.,. The oh

Ing in mind that If you ~pend more than I.K minutes with each stem following the
rool, that timc I1lU~t be made up e"'ewhere.

Some student\ may wi,h to highlight or underline the facts. TI* can either Ix:
helpful. or a waste of time. In order to highlight effectively. there muq ~till be
some awnrcne\s of the relative importance of the materi,t1 highlighted. You may
feclll how much material you highlighted in your ca~lxKlk'i during the first weeks
of law ~choo1. Soon, as you grew more scn~itive to the relevant facts and law. le~s
ilnd less was being highlighted. This vva, a product of learning how 10 read a case.
In llIuch the same way, you will learn hOlv to recognil.e the vital facts, nnd di,re 
gard the imm,lterial.

In reading the root of the Archie-Reggie example, above, it may not be a~ impor 
tant to note that Archie was running for ofike as it wa~ to note that the accident
occurred in front of the as\'Cmbled student body. thus incrca~ing the probability
that Archie would be humtliated. This b not to completely di"Countthe Archie's
purpose for being in the ;lUditoriUIll. or that Reggie 1\ as hi~ opponent. The tact that
Archie was there to participate in a debate make~ it clear that the audience would
lilely watch Archie's evcry mOle. The fach arc not dear on Reggie's intent in
Slicking out his leg: while it might aprxar that he intended 10 trip Archic, we have
to be careful illlllakillg an unwarrantcd assumption, In thb example. we appear to
be mis~ing a critical fa<::t. ;mJ cannot make up for it \1 ith imagination. The re:.olu 
tion of thi~ i~sue is likely the ley 10 the problem, and 1\ ill be dealt with in the
;tn~wer ehoiee~.

It i, important that you follow the faeb and do not light or re~pond emotionally to
the facb thm arc given. This mean~ taking the faet~ at face value. without reading
too lIlu<::h into the tacts. In this rcgllrd, yOll Illay need to ,tille some of the natural
inclinations of an advocate, as arguing or aS~llming fact~ may do little c;o;cept wllSle
time or leaJ to an inl;orrel;t response. Where the facts state thatlhe arrc~tin£ officer

iii INTRODUCnON:THERULESOFTHEROAD

had a \ alid warrant. do not atlcmpt to challenge the I\'arrnllt. Where the fal.:ts state
thaI the police made a random stop. do Ilot go on to consider the l:JOssible excep 
tions to the warrant requirement. Where the facb state that a deed b lalld and has
been properly executed. there is no need to as" if the de..cription is sufficient.

Some rules lIlay seem unfair. perhaps e\en illogical. in applying the facts. For
example, Why shouldn't a physician be required 10 act to rcnder assistance to
another who may oc seriously injured as a result of the physician's inaction, \\ here
there is no ris" to the physician. and despite the fact that the victim \\as placed in
perit by another? Why ~houldn't a party be allowed to prove up a subsequent
n:medial measure to pro\e negligence or culrmbility. when such remedy is logi 
cally connected to the dangerous condition causing injury? The MilE is nOlthe
place to argue policy. and anempting to do so will exact a \ery high toll. Again. do
not resl:JOnd with emotion. but rather a reasoned ;Ippro..1ch 10 applying the law to
the faeK

If a straight forward interpretation is ;Ivail<lble. do not over-analyze or seek out an
unnecessarily convoluted interpretation. A rea.'>Onable.logical inference may. how 
e\er. oc required. Ensure ttwt the inferred fact logically und nel:essarily follows
from the information given. Making a..ssumptions. Heating new facts. or working
with conclusions that are not warranted by the existing facts will. in most instances.
generate an incorrect respon ..e.

Conqi1UtlOnal Law. Contracts ,1l1d Real Property arc where the subjects that are
Illore demilllding on reading comprchension. given the Ilalure of the ..ubjcct matter
and the tendelu.:y that the examiners have to usc longer. more complex fact pat 
tClllS with multiple parties to lest in these area~. Fact patterns in these arc..1~ will
often require greater scrutiny, and Iher<~'fore require more time.

Te~ting in Crimes. Evidence and Tons lend~ 10 emplm~ize elements and command
of the black lener law. A.. a result. the flKt pUl1erns tend to be ,honcr. and may
require le~s in the way of reading l:omprehcn,ion, and more in the II ay of substan 
me knowledge of the rules of luw.

When reading the facts. regardlcss of the subject. keep in mind thilt the examiner is
tesllng on lawyering ~kilk Ca~s very oftcn turn on dct;jil~. ~o an effective read 
II1g of the fal:h will often depenJ on the examinee's ability to discem the opermive

each indi~iduars approach. and lhal only comes through practice. You must sort
through each sugge,tioll. and inco'1Xlrate only that which ha... produ;;cd the great

Arguably. if the work done in reading the facts and the call of the que.,tlon has
been succcssfui. thcn thcrc should be little effort expended in reaching your de.,li

On occa~ion, the correct llll~\\'er may appear obviou". Certainly. If the all',wer is
ob\ ious. do nOI fight it. In other inS\<lnces. however. it will seem as though the
examiner has taken great pains to hide the ball. The incolTC(:t <lnswers. referred to
<lS diqr;leters by the eX<lminers, arc aptly n,ltlled,

Con~idcr the Archie-Reggie example (Question I) above. It \\ould appear that Reggte

state of mind, and we Cllnnot ,lffonJ to guess at \\ hat Reggie was thinking. The facts
~tate Ihm Archie was not injured. so lhe (B) re'l)()n,e. based on negligence, is im 
probable. The (C) re'pon,e can be ruled out. beeause an action for battery or inten 
tional intliction of emotional distress can be mall1tained cvcn in the absence of
actual phy,ical harm. The (D) response can <llw be eliminated. as it limits liability

offense to Archie... dignity or the intent to cause emotional distress. The (A) rc 
"pon,e. therefore. is Ihe key. or correct re'ponse. By using the I~ord know it ad 
dresses the missing clement of intent.

Typic<llly, thc person dmtiing the que<,tion is or has been a law professor. As a
result. he or she has ample cxpenence with the phrasings that arc likely 10 lure an
examinec into an incorrcet responsc. There must be something anracti\c in a
distracter. It may IJc an in<lecur<lte or incomplete statement of the law. It may Irigger
sOl11e faim memory of an arclme rule. It may be a concept that hal> becn drilled into
you. Or. more likely. the distr;lCter may reflect an incompletc understanding of a
rule that has traditiollally led 10 confll~ion,

In the Archie-Reggie eXllIliple. the cxaminer may have hcen counting on the diffi

RUtE 119 HE ALERT FOR CIIANG1NG ROAf) CONlJITIONS

The three complete ell,lnJlllcs alxl\c followed a fairly standard forlllat. The root
wa~ followed by the ~tem. whil;h ill turn was follo\\<.:--<I by options which e,t('h
li.,ted an outcome follo\\ed by a propo'l;d ba,is on whil;h 10 support the outcome.
The method used to arrive at the correct respon", in ,he explanations above was
the proee"" of elimination. Once we eliminated the f:the statelllenh. whatever re 
mained became our 1>Clcction.

Another way to view the exam i, as a multiple truc-false te,l. rather than multiple
choice. Thalme,lIls looking ,It c,lCh oplion. inUepenUcntly. a, a true-f,I!'" question.
II II ill be helpful to mark a T or <til F lIext to each option as you read throllgh them.
Ahernately. yOll mightu", a sy..tem of rlu~s or minu",s. or crossing Ollt the fabe
statements. Selecting the correct option then become, a function of looking for a
T. a pins. or un option 1\ hich has not been crossed out.

But wllat about the options with a question mark next 10 them? What if yOIl can
only narrow it down to two ehoiee~?

If y'ou are able 10 narrow it dO\1 n to tllO ehoice~. one of which is correct. you are
definitely on the right Irack. You will have increased Ihe odds of gelling the prob 
lem correct by IOO','f. This is one reason why you may wish to indicate your ~ec­
oml choice as you worl.. through the praclice questions. As you read through the
explanatory anSlleTS. you will seck 10 de\elop a sense of why the ellaminer prefers
one choice o\'er another.

Remember that the e"aminer. at least ill the problem types we h<t\'e reviewed so
far. is pUlling you on the hum for the hest legal basis 011 1\ hich to support a gh en
outcome. Con~quently.theanswer which j~ n,lrrower or more speCific to the re 
slill i, usually preferred: Ihe s<tme is true when comparing a Ieg,ll b,lsis wilh ,I
f,lCtUlil b<tsj,. Thc legal basis is generally preferred. For example. Not guilty. be 
cause the faCls do lint ,tate lhal Defendant had ,111 improper mOlivc does not present
a~ good a legal basis as Not gUilty. because Defendant lacked the intent to steal in
exculpating the defendant in an example testing on larceny.

He on the alert for tho~ answer choices that are underinelusive or o\'crindusi\'e in
..t:lting the basis for thc outcome. For example. the option stming Constitutional.

Problems of this type l;an generally be attacked wilh a two-step approach. A~k
your;c1f Ihe following: What is the rule being Ie_ted (as identified by Ihe ~teml?
And. flow is it to be ilpplied. i.e.. what i~ the tas!" to pcrfonJl'! In thl~ e~ample. the
stelll mdic,ltcs that the rule being te~tcd is the Statute of Fr,lUds (requiring a writ 
ing in order 10 enforce cenain types of ugrcements). and lhe lask is to classify each
contract to sec whether it falls within the Statute. Options (Al. (B). and (el each

10 argue the clement of reliance. The e,xaminers arc counting on this. expecting

some student;. will wa_,tc time \\ anting to argue. If you have ,Ill argu,lble response.

versus a clear cut re,pl.)I1se, do nOI \\aste lime. Answer the question. and then
completely era~e it from )lour mind, One oflhe pitfall~ of the exam is that l;er1"in
problems Jre.'>O challenging that a student will continue to work it in the hack of
the head long after a response has been marked. Resist this temptation. as it will
only slow you down. frustrate )Iou and destroy your effecthene~s.

The mo<.t efficient. effective way 10 \\'ork this problem is 10 treat it in the same way
that we h<lve ;dready seen. that i~. to treat it as a compound true~fal~ que~tiol1, The

strict liability. i.e., di~bur~ing highly toxic gases into the mmo,pherc in a popu

CONTRACTS QUESTIONS

Questions 2 - 5 are based on the
following facts:

1. Henry, a nationwide distributor of ste 
reo equipment, phones Jim and agrees
that he will sell twe1vehundred stereo
systems to Jim, another merchant, for
$500 each - if delivery can be made be 
fore August 1. Jim states that he will
think about it. Jim, then sends a confir 
mation form to Henry, signed by Jim
stating the price of the goods and the
quantity of the stereo systems. Henry
received this form on July 1. On July
16, Henry informs Jim that he will not
perform, due to an increase in produc 
tion costs. Jim sues Henry for breach
of contract. Which of the following
statements are most correct?

A. Given the above facts, the parol
evidence rule is applicable, and
Jim would win.

B. If Henry asserts the statute of
frauds as a defense, Henry would
win.

C. The statute of frauds requires that
Jim should have signed the con 
firmation form.

D. If Henry asserts the statute of
frauds, he will probably be un 
successful.

Tammy Fayray had been a hardworking and
loyal employee of Staged Entertainment
(Staged), an organization that produces pup 
pet shows, for over 28 years. Tammy was
the leading puppeteer for Baker and was well
known for her work entertaining people of
all ages with a puppet she created, named
"Jimmy." After receiving Tammy's sudden
and unexpected notice of retirement, Mr.
Baker, the owner of Staged, promised
Tammy $500.00 per month for the rest of
her life, in appreciation of Tammy's "28
years of outstanding creative efforts and
skills" for Staged. Tammy cried out, "Thank
you, this is the biggest surprise I've ever
gotten!" Tammy knew, during her employ 
ment with Staged, that it never had any re 
tirement plan for any of its employees.

Intending to splurge on herself, Tammy im 
mediately went out and purchased a lynx fur
coat. She incurred an installment payment
of $600.00 per month for 10 years, after ap 
plying her entire savings of $20,000.00 as a
down payment. Tammy would never have
purchased the coat had Mr. Baker not prom 
ised to pay her the money for life. Mr. Baker
disapproves of personal indulgence and
stopped the payments to Tammy after he
discovered Tammy's purchase of the coat.
Mr. Baker had sent Tammy the funds for 18
months at the time he discontinued his pay 
ments to Tammy.

CONTRACTS Ell

2. What was the legal effect, if any, of
Tammy's statement to Mr. Baker after
hearing Mr. Baker's promise oflifetime
income?

A. A gratuitous promise is not en-
forceable against the promisor in
the absence of special circum-
stances.

A. There was a valid and binding

B. An offer without consideration is

acceptance by Tammy.

not enforceable.

B. At the moment of the statement,
there was an objective meeting
of the minds.

e.

It created acceptance, only if
Tammy expressly promised not
to be self-indulgent with the
funds.

D. It has no binding legal effect.

e. A gratuitous promise, coupled
with detrimental reliance,
is
binding upon the promisor where
the promise bargains for an ex-
change.

D. A party cannot unilaterally
change the terms of a gratuitous
promise.

3. Under what legal theory will Tammy

least likely recover?

A. Legally enforceable gratuitous

promise.

5.

Tammy contends that she will be suc-
cessful in enforcing Mr. Baker's prom-
ise, under the theory of promissory es-
toppel. However, Mr. Baker will most
likely prevail under which of the fol-
lowing arguments?

B. Moral obligation.

e. Promissory estoppel.

D. Legal detriment theory of con-

sideration.

4.

In evaluating Mr. Baker's statement,
which of the following rules will the
court most likely find to be the correct
and applicable law to the case:

A. Tammy's conduct in reliance on
Mr. Baker's statement was un-
foreseeable.

B. Mr. Baker did not intend for
Tammy to rely upon his prom-
Ise.

e. Tammy's conduct was not suffi-
cient legal detriment to support
the enforceability of Mr. Baker's
promIse.

mCONTRACTS

D. Since Mr. Baker was only mak 
ing a gift to Tammy, promissory
estoppel has no application to the
facts of this case.

6. Albert purchased a ski boat at a police
auction. After one outing, Albert real 
ized the boat had a slow leak and needed
to be repaired. Albert took the boat to
Sam's Ski and Boat Repair. After Sam
had repaired the boat, Albert discovered
it still leaked. The repair bill showed
that Albert was charged $350 for parts
and $400 for labor. A dispute arose over
this transaction. Does Article 2 of the
u.e.e. apply to this transaction?

A. Article 2 clearly applies.

B. Article 2 may apply depending
on a determination of whether
the predominant factor in the
transaction was the sale of goods.

e. Article 2 does not apply.

D. Article 2 applies only to the la 

bor.

Mayor and the Governor are making the fi 
nal arrangements to move the state hockey
team, the "Knuckleheads," to City. The
ten-acre proposed site is very close to 1st
and Meridian. Various general contractors
are submitting bids to construct the sports
complex. Girkin spends a large amount of
money hiring marketing consultants and
improving the restaurant at 1st and Merid 
ian. After spending nearly all his savings,
Girkin is invited to the Governor's mansion.
Very late into the evening, he notices the
Governor and Mayor engaged in a serious
discussion. Girkin gets within earshot to
hear, "Well, now that the sport complex deal
has been finalized, let's start our downtown
renovation program." Girkin gets himself
into the conversation and excitedly exclaims,
"It's finally going to happen!" Both the
Mayor and the Governor nod yes. GK, Inc.,
one of the general contractors, is awarded
the contract to build the sports complex by
Mayor. SK Enterprises is an electrical sub 
contractor who provided a subcontracting
bid upon which GK, Inc. 's bid is based.

21.

If SK Enterprises fails to perform, can
Mayor sue GK, Inc.?

A. No, because Mayor had no do 
native intent towards the SK En 
terprises.

B. No, because Mayor would be a
creditor beneficiary if she had
advanced salary to GK, Inc.

C. Yes, because Mayor would be a

creditor beneficiary.

vested rights in the contract be 
tween SK Enterprises and GK,
Inc.

as the general contractor is not
responsible for the breach of sub 
contractors.

B. Yes, since SK Enterprises, as the
subcontractor, is the obligor.

C. Yes, if Mayor and GK, Inc. have
a valid enforceable contract.

D. Yes, if GK, Inc. and SK Enter 
prises had a valid enforceable
contract.

23.

fire, and there is a lack of adequate in 
surance because of Mayor's negligence,
can Girkin sue as a third party benefi 
ciary?

A. Yes, if the negligence of the two

tortfeasors are proven in court.

CONTRACTS m

B. No, because Mayor is an offi 

cious intermeddler.

C. No, Girkin did not have the right

to receive any duty.

D. No, the agreement of Mayor and
GK, Inc. can vitiate any vested
rights Girkin had.

24. SK Enterprises completes work accord 
ing to the sub-contract. Mayor does not
pay GK; so GK does not pay SK. SK
Enterprises sues Mayor. What is the
most likely outcome?

A. Mayor's damages will be offset
by any breach of GK, Inc.

B. Mayor's damages will be offset
by any breach of SK Enterprises.

C. SK Enterprises has suffered a

"legal" detriment.

beneficiary to the Mayor/GK,
Inc. agreement.

nated to that of the Knucklehead's uni 
forms. Because this would mean that
Girkin's restaurant would have to re 
paint and change all of the food pack

mative nod he received at the party and
the reliance upon it?

A. Yes, Girkin has suffered a bar 
gained-for legal detriment.

lied.

C. Yes, mayor should have known
by Girkin's exclamation that he

ted the price term. A month later, Liz
called to confirm the date of delivery,
but was told by Sally that she did not
need the order. Assuming that Liz sues
Sally for a breach of contract, what is
the most likely outcome?

because the written confirmation
was not signed by the party to
be charged.

B. There will be judgment for Sally
because the confirmation was
insufficient since the price was
omitted.

C. There will be judgment for Sally
because Liz did not verify the
order with Sally within 10 days

dent, but purchased the Forge truck,
because she thought Cal was a convinc 
ing salesman. Robin rolls her truck and
is also injured. She sues Forge for her
injuries, who prevails?

A. Robin, since Forge made an ex 
press warranty on which she re 
lied.

B . Robin, since her car was totaled.

C. Forge, since Robin could not
have relied on the affirmation in
entering the contract.

D. Forge, since Cal actually made
the representations to Robin.

46. Smith, a commercial real estate broker,
traveled quite frequently in order to
consummate real estate sales. Late one
night, while returning home to Califor 
nia from a business trip, in which Smith
had sold a $2.1 billion dollar commer 
cial building, he left his brief case in
the baggage claim area at the airport.
The next morning, Smith realized that
he had left his brief case at the airport.
He phoned the airport to see if anyone
had turned in his brief case, but the se 
curity desk told Smith nobody had
turned his brief case in to "Lost and
Found." Smith, desperate to get his brief
case back, since it had all the legal pa 
pers from his $2.1 billion dollar sale,
posted flyers all around the airport. The
flyers stated:

"Lost - one black brief case,
contains the name 'Smith.' Will
pay $500.00 to anyone for its
return. Call (213) 555-2645."

Early that evening, Ethel, who had just
arrived to California, read the flyer
posted in the arriving area while she was
waiting, for some friends to pick her up.
After an hour of waiting, she went to
the baggage claim area to claim her lug 
gage. Her friends were in the baggage
area waiting her arrival. Ethel, retrieved
all her bags and noticed the black brief
case described on the flyer on the lug 
gage carousel. She picked up the brief
case, tore a lost flyer off the wall and
left the airport with her friends.

CONTRACTS iii

A few days later, Smith realized that he
had put those legal papers in his suit 
case. Since he had found the papers and
the brief case was worth less than
$500.00, he decided that he did not need
the return of the brief case. As Smith
was on his way out the door to go to
the airport to take down the posted fly 
ers, Ethel called regarding the brief case
that she had found. She asked Smith,
"Did you lose a black brief case at the
airport?" Before anything else was said
by Ethel, Smith replied, "I thought I had
left important legal papers in the brief
case that I was working on, but I've
found the papers." He further stated that
he was just leaving to pull all the flyers
from the airport in cancellation of the
reward offer. If Ethel claims the $500.00
reward from Smith, she will:

A. Recover, because a contract was
formed when she called Smith to
return his brief case.

B. Recover, because Smith created
a unilateral contract upon the
posting of the flyers, and once
Ethel performed, it became irre 
vocable.

C. Not recover, because no contract

Questions 47 - 48 are based on the
following facts:

On September 1, X wrote a letter to Y, an
acquaintance of his, stating, "I'm in need of
a truck for transportation for my business
and will buy your 'YO' truck for $10,000,
upon you bringing it to my office at 1313
Capitol Street in Anaheim, on or before Sep 
tember 6." On September 3, Y received the
letter and immediately replied by mail, "I
accept your offer and promise to deliver the
truck September 6 before noon." Y mailed
the acceptance letter but the letter got lost in
the mail and was never received by X.

On September 4, X purchased a truck from
Z, for his business transportation needs. Late
that night, Z ran into Y, and told him that X
had purchased his truck for his business, and
that he, Z, was interested in purchasing his
truck for $7,000. Y replied to Z that he would
think about his offer of purchase and would
get back to him in a few days.

On September 6, at 9:00 a.m., Y arrived at
X's business, but X was not there. At 11 :00
a.m., X arrived and refused to buy Y's truck,
because he already purchased a truck and
had no need for two trucks. Y sues X for
breach of contract.

was formed.

47. What legal effect did Y's letter have?

D. Not recover, unless she returns

the brief case.

A. The letter dated September 2,
bound both parties to a bilateral
contract because Y could accept
by an act or a promise.

&I CONTRACTS

B. The letter dated September 2,
bound both parties to a unilateral
contract as soon as Y mailed the
letter.

C. The letter had no legal effect, al-
lowing X to revoke his offer.

D. The September 2nd letter would
only be an acceptance had X re-
ceived Y's letter.

48. What is the legal effect of Z's conver-

sation with Y?

A. There is no legal effect because
X's offer was irrevocable.

B. There is no legal effect because
Z was making an offer to pur-
chase Y's truck.

C. Z's conversation with Y termi-
nated X's original offer, and op-
erated as an offer for Z to pur-
chase Y's truck for $7,000.

D. The conversation operated as a
termination of Y's power of ac-
ceptance of X's offer.

Questions 49 - 50 are based on the
following facts:

Jack, a retired Olympic swimmer, decided
to follow through with his long-time dream
to build a large indoor swimming pool for
the purpose of training youngsters for com 
petition. Dan orally contracted with Jack on
March 10 to build the pool, spectator bleach 
ers and a parking lot. Bill has already orally
agreed to permit the building of a parking
lot on his property that is adjacent to Jack's
property. Dan agreed to begin work on the
project on March 20, and to complete the
work by June 15, in time for summer. The
total price of the job is $28,000, to be paid
in three installments: $13,000 on March 20,
$5,000 when the pool and bleachers are com 
pleted, and $10,000 when Dan finishes with
the parking lot.

49. Assume that Jack tendered the $13,000
on March 20, and that Dan refused to
accept it, or perform. If Jack sues Dan
for breach of contract, which defense(s)
can Dan successfully use?

A. The Jack-Bill agreement was not

in writing.

B. The Jack-Dan agreement was not

in writing.

C. Both A and B.

D. Neither A nor B.

50. Assume that Jack paid the $13,000 on
March 20, and that Dan completed the
pool and bleachers, according to speci-
fications. However, Jack then refused
to pay the second installment, and re-
pudiates the contract. Which of the fol-
lowing is correct?

A. Dan has a cause of action against
Jack for $5,000 in damages.

B. Dan can refuse to finish the park-
ing lot, and not be liable for
breach of contract.

C. Both A and B.

D. Neither A nor B.

51. Bar Candidate orally agreed to sell his
bar materials to Student for $1,500. Bar
Candidate explained to Student that he
was only interested in selling the mate-
rials to Student if Bar Candidate passes
the bar exam. For that reason, the par-
ties also agreed that the transaction
would not take effect unless Bar Can-
didate passed his bar exam. After two
weeks had lapsed, Bar Candidate and
Student reduced their agreement into a
writing, but no mention was made that
the sale would be contingent upon Bar
Candidate passing his bar exam.

In an action by Student against Bar
Candidate for breach of contract, how
should the court rule on Bar Candidate's
offer of proof that he did not pass his
bar exam?

72 CONTRACTS

A. The evidence is admissible be-
cause Bar Candidate's purpose of
the contract was frustrated.

B. The evidence is admissible be-
cause the final writing was not a
full integration of the parties oral
agreement.

C. The evidence is barred because

of the Statute of Frauds.

D. The evidence is barred because
the oral agreement contradicts
the written agreement.

52. Seller, contracted in writing to deliver
to Buyer, 10,000 cartons of milk on
May 1 at $ 1.00 a carton. Because the
farmers who supplied Seller with his
milk did not deliver enough milk, Seller
only had 9,000 cartons of milk to ful-
fill his contract with Buyer. If Seller
tenders only 9,000 cartons of milk to
Buyer on May 1, and Buyer refuses to
accept, or pay for any, which is the best
statement regarding their contractual
relationship?

A. The doctrine of impossibility of
performance excuses Seller from
performing the contact.

B. Seller can sue Buyer since he
substantially performed the con-
tract.

C. Buyer is obligated to give Seller

time to cure. 

D. Buyer has a cause of action
against Seller for Seller's failure
to deliver 10,000 cartons of milk.

53. Miller started a car wash in Columbus,
Ohio. He leased his equipment from
Americo in 1987, under a five-year
lease which was renewable for 3
one-year periods. At the end of eight
years, Americo would "abandon" the
equipment to Miller (he would have
paid for it in full). In May 1991, Miller
defaulted. Americo repossessed and re 
sold the equipment. Americo claims it
is owed $2,000 by Miller, under a lease
provision which provides that Americo
could collect 10% of the equipment's
total cost in the event of any default.
Miller claims the liquidated damages
clause is invalid. Is the liquidated dam 
ages clause valid?

A. Yes, because there was a meet 

ing of the minds.

B. Yes, because it is to determine
whether or not Miller would de 
fault at the inception of the lease.

C. No, because a 10% liquidated
damages clause in any contract
is unconscionable as a matter of
law.

D. No, because the damages to
Americo would not be difficult
to ascertain.

Questions 54 - 55 are based on the
following facts:

In a written contract, Manufacturer agreed
to deliver to Baker, 200 described chairs at
$100 each EO.B., at Manufacturer's place
of business. The contract provided that "nei 
ther party will assign the contract without
written consent of the other." Manufacturer
placed the chairs on the carrier on August
31. On September 1, Manufacturer in a
signed writing, assigned to Wheeler all his
rights under the Manufacturer-Baker con 
tract. On September 3, the chairs were de 
stroyed by fire while in transit.

54.

In an action by Wheeler against Baker
for breach of contract, Wheeler will re 
cover:

A. $20,000, the contract price.

B. The difference between the con 
tract price and the market value
of the chairs.

C. Nothing, because the chairs had

not been delivered.

D. Nothing, because the Manufac 
turer and Baker contract forbid
an assignment.

55.

In an action by Baker against Manufac 
turer for breach of contract, Barker will
probably:

A. Succeed, since the risk of loss

was on Manufacturer.

CONTRACTS &I

57. The Bank of Commerce Inc. ("BCI")
loaned the Bombay Company $1 mil 
lion for the manufacture of a new type
of computer chip. As a condition of the
loan, Wendy Wonder, a majority share 
holder in Bombay, agreed in writing to
personally guarantee the loan. There 
after, Bombay defaulted on the loan and
entered into a repayment agreement
with BCL This agreement provided that
BCI would "use maximum efforts in
selling Bombay's assets at the highest
possible price." BCI proceeded to sell
Bombay's assets, discharging the in 
debtedness of the Bombay Company.

Later, it was ascertained that BCI did
not realize the "highest possible price"
in administering the sale of Bombay's
assets. Consequently, Wendy was
forced into bankruptcy and lost her en 
tire investment in the Bombay Com 
pany.

Wendy brings an appropriate action
against BCI to recover her investment
in Bombay's stock. She will most
likely:

A. Not prevail, because Wendy was
an incidental beneficiary of the
BCI sale of Bombay's assets.

B. Not prevail, because BCl's sale
of Bombay's assets discharged
whatever contractual relation 
ship existed between Wendy and
the bank.

B. Succeed, since the contract was

not assigned.

C. Not succeed, since the risk of

loss was on Baker.

D. Not succeed, since the chairs
were destroyed making it impos 
sible for Manufacturer to per 
form.

56. Billy Joe, a disabled veteran, contracted
to purchase a certain piece of land from
Jermey. The property consisted of a
1.65-acre home site, and an 80-acre
tract of land containing the famous tour 
ist attraction, "Blue Lagoon". Billy was
excited because he could now be a ho 
meowner and receive income in order
to pay the land payments and his living
expenses. After BillyJoe purchased the
property, he discovered that the home
site was on Federal Reserve Land, and
that the income from the lagoon was
$36,000 rather than $39,000 as repre 
sented. Billy Joe sued Jermey. Billy Joe
can:

1. Recover money damages

only.

II. Rescind the contract.

A. I only.

B.

II only.

C. lor II.

D. Neither I nor II.

III CONTRACTS

C. Prevail, because BCI did not re 
alize the highest possible price
from the sale of Bombay's assets.

D. Prevail, because BCI breached
its fiduciary duty to Wendy un 
der the terms of the BCI-Bombay
contract.

Questions 58 - 59 are based on the
following facts:

On January 5, Prevention Company, a manu 
facturer of steel security blinds for homes,
received the following order from Lion
Homes: "Please ship 500 4' x 6' security shut 
ters. Delivery by March 10."

On February 10, Prevention shipped 500 4'
x 8' security shutters, which were received
by Lion on February 12. The following day
Lion's foreman, Dave White, sent the fol 
lowing fax to Prevention's president, John
Smallwood, "Be advised that your shipment
is rejected. Order stipulated 4' x 6' security
shutters." The fax was received by John
Smallwood on February 15. Lion, however,
did not ship the nonconforming shutters back
to Prevention.

On February 16, Mr. Smallwood sent the
following telegram to Mr. White: "Will ship
conforming security shutters before March
1." This telegram was received by Mr. White
on February 17, but he did not respond to it.
On March 7, Prevention tendered the 500
shutters of proper size to Lion, which were
refused.

58. Did Lion properly refuse the first ship 
ment delivered on February l2?

A. No, because Lion waived its
right to reject the nonconform 
ing goods by not returning them.

CONTRACTS iii

Questions 60 - 61 are based on the
following facts:

Tom wanted to have a security system in 
stalled in his home. He contacted several
companies and had them submit bids for the
installation of the system. SecureCo, in tum,
requested bids from several wholesalers for
prices of burglar alarm components which
it planned to use if awarded the job. BurgCo
submitted a bid to SecureCo that was used
in computing the bid for Tom.

On October 1, SecureCo sent Tom its bid,
of $5,000 for the security system and its in 
stallation. On October 9, BurgCo notified
SecureCo that they would be unable to sup 
ply any burglar alarm components to
SecureCo. On October 11, Tom sent the fol 
lowing telegram to SecureCo, "I hereby ac 
cept your offer to install the security system
for $5,000."

SecureCo had to pay another wholesaler
$1,000 above the quoted price by BurgCo
for the burglar alarm components. As a re 
sult, SecureCo advised Tom that the total
price for the job would be $6,000. Tom re 
plied that he would hold SecureCo to the
price stated in the submitted bid. SecureCo
went ahead and installed the security sys 
tem.

60.

In an action by SecureCo against Tom,
SecureCo will be able to recover:

A. $5,000, because that was the con 

tract price.

B. No, because Prevention could
accept Lion's offer by prompt
shipment of either conforming or
nonconforming goods.

C. Yes, because the security shut 
ters were nonconforming.

D. Yes, because Prevention did not
notify Lion that the 4' x 8' secu 
rity shutters were for accommo 
dation only.

59. Did Lion properly reject the security

shutters delivered on March 7?

A. No, because, under the VCC, a
contract for the sale of goods can
be modified without consider 
ation.

B. No, because Prevention cured
the February 10 defective ship 
ment by tender of conforming
goods on March 7.

C. Yes, because Prevention's ship 
ping of the 4' x 8' security shut 
ters on February constituted an 
ticipatory breach.

D. Yes, because Prevention's ship 
ping of the 4' x 8' security shut 
ters on February 10 constituted
a present breach.

m CONTRACTS

B. $6,000, because of an unantici 
pated change of circumstances.

C. Only in quantum merit, because
SecureCo did not intend to oper 
ate at a loss.

D. Only in quantum meruit, because
by demanding $6,000 SecureCo
repudiated its contract with Tom.

61. What argument best supports the claim
for the additional $1,000 by SecureCo
against BurgCo?

A. BurgCo had made an offer to
SecureCo that was accepted
when it submitted its bid.

B. BurgCo had made an offer that
SecureCo accepted by using the
former's bid in computing the
bid it submitted to Tom.

C. BurgCo's bid was an offer that it
was obligated to hold open be 
cause of the fact that BurgCo and
SecureCo were merchants.

D. An option contract was created
when SecureCo used BurgCo's
bid.

62. Tony, a third year law student at Wazoo
Law School, was the captain of the
Moot Court team. One evening Tony
and a few classmates were drinking beer
at Texas Lucky's, a favorite Wazoo Law
School hangout. They were worried that
the Moot Court team, known as the
Litigators, would be forced to disband
because the law school had withdrawn
its sponsorship. While Ann was discuss 
ing the problem with her teammates,
Peter, the owner of the bar, approached
the group. Peter indicated that he was
interested in sponsoring the Moot Court
because he felt it would bring in more
business from the law school. During
their discussion, Peter agreed to spon 
sor the Moot Court team. They then
entered into a written agreement, which
provided that Peter would pay for all
the "usual sponsoring fees."

Peter had understood the agreement to
mean that he would supply the keg of
beer following each competition. Con 
versely, Tony thought that Peter would
be reimbursing the team for 1) trans 
portation costs, 2) research and mate 
rial costs, 3) the keg of beer, and 4)
plaques to the competition finalists. Did
a contract exist between Tony and Pe 
ter?

A. No contract exists.

B. Yes, a contract exists on the
terms understood by Tony.

C. Yes, a contract exists on the
terms understood by Peter.

CONTRACTS iii

D. Yes, a contract exists but only on
the consistent terms between the
parties.

Questions 63 - 65 are based on the
following facts:

On September 1, Oliva Co., an olive whole 
saler, sent Mario, the owner of an Italian res 
taurant in Los Angeles, the following signed
letter:

"Have 300 pounds oflarge fresh olives avail 
able at $3.00 per pound for October deliv 
ery. This offer will remain open for accep 
tance until October 1. Please reply if inter 
ested."

On September 30, Mario wired the follow 
ing telegram to Oliva Co., which it received
the next day:

"Please be advised that I hereby accept your
offer dated September 1. However, I would
appreciate your delivering 150 pounds in
October and 150 pounds in November if you
possibly can."

63. According to the given facts, is it pos 
sible that Oliva Co., could have revoked
the offer before October 1?

A. No, because it had given Mario
assurance that the offer would be
held open until October 1.

B. No, because Oliva Co. and Mario

are merchants.

C. Yes, because there is no consid 
eration to support an option con 
tract.

&I CONTRACTS

D. Yes, unless Mario detrimentally

relied on the offer.

64. Mario's telegram of September 30 has

which of the following effects?

A. It has no legal effect because the
mode of acceptance was not by
the same means as the offer.

B.

It operates as a rejection of Oliva
Co.'s offer, and a proposal of a
counteroffer.

C. It creates a contract for 150
pounds of olives for October de-
livery and 150 pounds of olives
for November delivery.

D. It creates a contract for 300
pounds of olives for October de-
livery.

65. Assume for the purposes of this ques-
tion only, that Oliva Co. delivered 150
pounds of olives to Mario during Octo-
ber and 150 pounds of olives during
November. However, 100 pounds of
those delivered in November were not
of merchantable quality. If Mario ac-
cepts the olives knowing of their defec-
tive condition, he probably has:

A. A remedy against Oliva Co.,
whether or not he gives Oliva Co.
notice of the breach.

B. A remedy against Oliva Co., pro-
vided he gives Oliva Co. notice
of the breach.

C)
0

cn

C. No remedy against Oliva Co.
because he waives whatever
claim he may have by accepting
the defective olives.

D. No remedy against Oliva Co.
because the risk of loss falls on
Mario due to the perishable na-
ture of the product. 

CONTRACTS 79

Questions 66 - 67 are based on the
following facts:

On March 1, 1993, Tromp entered into a
written contract with Leon wherein the lat 
ter agreed to remodel the penthouse suite of
Tromp's hotel for $2 million. According to
the terms of the agreement, Tromp prom 
ised to pay Leon $1 million when work was
to commence on May 1, 1993, with the bal 
ance payable upon completion of the job.

On April 1, 1993, Leon sent Tromp a letter
stating that the cost of building materials had
increased from his original estimate. Con 
sequently, Leon indicated that he did not
think he could perform the remodeling work
unless Tromp agreed to increase the price to
$2.5 million. Without notifying Leon, Tromp
went ahead and hired Ivan to perform the
remodeling for the price of $2.2 million,
which was the fair market cost of the work
to be done.

Ivan started renovating the penthouse on
April 26, 1993. On May 1, 1993, Leon
showed up at Tromp's hotel. Leon told
Tromp he reconsidered and was ready to
begin remodeling the penthouse at the origi 
nal contract price. Tromp then informed him
that he had hired someone else and dismissed
Leon from the job.

66. Leon brings suit against Tromp for
breach of contract. Judgment will be
for?

Ell CONTRACTS

A. Leon, because Tromp did not in 
form him before May 1 that he
was hiring someone else to per 
form the remodeling work.

B. Leon, because he attempted to
perform the remodeling work as
contractually agreed.

C. Tromp, because he hired Ivan for
$300,000 less than Leon de 
manded in his April 1 letter.

D. Tromp, because Leon's April 1
letter manifested his prospective
inability to perform, thereby jus 
tifying Tromp treating such as an
anticipatory breach.

67. Assume for the purposes of this ques 
tion only, that Leon is liable for breach
of contract in the previous example. In
addition, assume that Ivan completed
the remodeling of the suite at a profit
of $300,000. Tromp went ahead and
paid Ivan the contract price of $2.2 mil 
lion, plus an additional $80,000 so Ivan
would not lose any money. In a breach
of contract action by Tromp against
Leon, Tromp should recover:

A. $200,000, or the difference be 
tween Leon's contract price and
Ivan's contract price.

B. $500,000, or the difference be 
tween Leon's original contract
price and the amount he de 
manded in his April 1 letter.

C. $1,000,000, or the difference
between Leon's original contract
price and the amount Tromp paid
Ivan.

D. $280,000, the difference between
Tromp's payment to Ivan and
Leon's original price.

68. Brown is the owner of Blackacres, a
twenty-acre horse ranch. On December
1, Brown and Green both signed an
agreement that stated, "In consideration
of $1,000, receipt of which is acknowl 
edged, Brown hereby offers to sell
Blackacres to Green, for $150,000. This
offer is to remain open for thirty days
upon the signing by each party. All
terms are incorporated."

The property had a fair market value of
$165,000. Green failed to pay Brown
the $1,000 consideration upon the sign 
ing of the agreement. On December 20,
Brown sent Green a letter stating:

"Have offer for the purchase of
Blackacres from White for $160,000. I
hereby withdraw my offer to you for
the sale of Blackacres for $150,000,
signed Brown."

The next day, Green tendered $151,000
cash to Brown for the purchase of
Blackacres (which included the $1,000
unpaid consideration money) and de 
manded the deed to Blackacres. Brown
refused. Green brings an action against
Brown for specific performance.

Brown seeks to introduce the fact that
Green never paid the $1,000 consider 
ation as required per their written and
signed agreement dated December 1.
Upon Green's objection, will the trial
court permit the testimony?

A. Yes, because the parole evidence
doctrine permits contradictory
facts in the parties' agreement.

B. Yes, because the parol evidence
rule does not operate to exclude
evidence of contemporaneous or
subsequent oral modifications of
the written term.

C. No, because the written instru 
ment is a complete integration of
the parties' agreement.

D. No, because the doctrine of
promissory estoppel will only
apply if Green relied on the
Brown-Green agreement to his
detriment.

CONTRACTS ED

69. Willy owned and operated the Willy's
Ice Cream and Sandwich Parlor. The
parlor was located at the busy intersec 
tion of the Pacific Coast Highway and
Dover. Because of its prime location,
Willy's was a popular stop for tourists
and vacationers. In 1982, Willy leased
the Parlor to Dick under a written
ten-year lease. During the sixth year of
the lease, the city reconstructed the
Highway. The city expanded an exist 
ing bridge in order to correct the traffic
congestion problem. Because of the re 
construction, the highway now went
over the parlor. This caused a substan 
tial decline in Dick's business.

Neither party had knowledge of the
city's intent to change that intersection
at the time they entered into the lease
agreement. Dick contacted Willy and
told him of the circumstances. Dick
asked Willy to renegotiate the lease
agreement, but Willy refused. Because
of the decline in the parlor's business,
Dick was losing money. He decided to
abandon the parlor and refuses to pay
Willy any rent. Willy brings an action
against Dick to recover the unpaid rent.
Who will prevail?

A. Dick, because of the doctrine of
impossibility of performance.

B. Dick, because the parties in 
ferred, within their agreement,
the continued existence of the
heavily traveled highway.

m CONTRACTS

C. Willy, because Dick assumed the
risk of any change in circum 
stances when he entered into the
lease.

D. Willy, because both parties were
wrong in their judgment con 
cerning the road change.

70. Tony engaged Dawn, an inexperienced
actress, to do a small role in a new
Broadway play for a period of six
months at a salary of $ 1,000 a week.
Dawn turned down another role in a
Broadway play, in order to accept this
engagement. On the third day of the run,
Dawn was hospitalized with bulimia
and Betty was hired to do the part. A
week later, Dawn recovered, but Tony
refuses to accept her services for the
remainder of the run. Dawn brings a
breach of contract action against Tony.
Which of the following is Dawn's best
legal theory?

A. Her acting contract with Tony
was legally severable into
weekly units.

B. Her performance of the literal
terms of the contract was physi 
cally impossible.

C. She had relied on the engage 
ment with Tony, as shown by
declining another acting role.

D. Her failure to perform for one
week was not a material failure.

Questions 71 — 72 are based on the
following facts:

On March 5, Seller orally agreed to sell his
land, Parcel, to Buyer for $135,000, to be
paid on March 31. Buyer orally agreed to
pay $35,000 of the purchase price to Credi-
tor in satisfaction of a debt which seller owed
to Creditor.

On March 12, Buyer had his attorney, Law-
yer, put the agreement into a writing. Law-
yer omitted all the terms in reference to the
$35,000 payment to Creditor. Lawyer's sec-
retary mistakenly typed $134,000 as the pur-
chase price, rather than $135,000, while pre-
paring the agreement. Neither Seller nor
Buyer read the contract carefully before
signing it on March 20, and neither Seller
nor Buyer noticed the error in the price.
Neither Buyer nor Seller raised any ques-
tion concerning omission of the payment to
Creditor.

71. In an action by Creditor against Buyer
for $35,000, which of the following is
(are) correct?

raise the Statute of
Frauds as a defense be-
cause the Buyer-Seller
agreement was to answer
for the debt of another.

II. Buyer could successfully
raise the Statute of
Frauds as a defense be-
cause the Buyer-Seller

Q    

agreement was for the
sale of an interest in land.  

A. I only.

B. II only.

C. I and II.

D. Neither I nor II. 

72. If Buyer refused to pay more than
$134,000 for Parcel, in an action by
Seller against Buyer for the additional
$1,000, it would be to Seller's advan-
tage to try to prove that:

A. The writing was intended only as

a sham.

B. The writing was only a partial

integration.

C. There was a mistake in integra-

tion.

D. There was a misunderstanding
between Seller and Buyer con-
cerning the purchase price.

Questions 76 - 77 are based on the
following facts:

Fannland is a three-acre dairy farm with a
small residence upon it. Oliver, the owner
of Fannland, entered into a written lease with
Terry for the rental of Farmland on a month 
to-month basis, at a rate of $1 ,600 per month.
After Terry had been in possession for sev 
eral years, Terry and Oliver orally agreed that

Oliver agreed that after receiving $24,000
in payments, Oliver would tender the deed
to Farmland to Terry, and Terry in exchange,
would execute a note secured by a deed of
trust for the balance of the unpaid purchase
price.

Terry, now being a homeowner, made over
$2,000 in improvements on the property.
When Terry had tendered $24,000 to Oliver,
Oliver, although not denying the oral agree 
ment, refused to tender the deed to Farm 
land. Terry brought an action against Oliver
for specific performance.

76. If Oliver prevails, it is because:

A. Nothing Terry would have done
would have overcome the agree 
ment not being in writing.

B. The actions and payment of
Terry are consistent with her be 
ing a tenant.

C. Oliver has not received any un 
conscionable benefit, and there 
fore Terry is not entitled to equi 
table relief.

D. The Statute of Frauds controls.

77. If Terry prevails, it will be because of:

A. The improvements show that
Terry detrimentally relied on the
oral agreement.

B. The $24,000 received by Oliver
as payment towards the purchase
price.

C. Oliver would receive an unjust
benefit if the contract is not en 
forced.

D. The contract entered into be 
tween Terry and Oliver was sup 
ported by consideration.

78. Coiner, a retail coin dealer, purchased
a 1916 dime from Investor for $500.
The "D" stamped on the coin indicated
it had originated at the Denver mint,
making it a rare issue. Coiner's owner,
Barry, examined the coin before the pur 
chase. Coiner, resold the rare coin to
Denny, for $750. Denny later found out
that the coin was a counterfeit. Denny
sued to rescind its purchase of the 1916
dime from Coiner. The court will:

CONTRACTS Ell

A. Allow rescission of the contract
because of a misrepresentation.

Questions 79 - 80 are based on the
following facts:

B. Allow rescission of the contract
because there was mutual mis 
take.

C. Not allow the contract to be re 
scinded because there was no
warranty made.

D. Not allow rescission of the con

Ray Rogers Jr. purchased an automobile
from a car dealer, Auto, on August 15, 1992.
On that date, Rogers was 17 years old and
would be 18 on September 25, 1992. Ray
executed a purchase money security agree 
ment to finance $4,724, the balance due on
the purchase price of the automobile, pay 
able in thirty installments of $198.10 each.
Auto subsequently assigned the purchase
money agreement to Union Fed Bank.

After making 11 monthly payments, Rogers
voluntarily returned the automobile to Auto,
and defaulted on his payment obligations.
Upon default, Union Fed Bank reassigned
the purchase money security agreement to
Auto. Auto sold the automobile at public
auction for $1,400, leaving a deficiency of
over $4,510.

79. Auto now brings suit against Rogers to
recover the deficiency. Judgment will
be for:

A. Auto, because Rogers affirmed

the contract.

B. Auto, because a minor cannot
disaffirm a contract after reach 
ing the age of majority.

C. Rogers, because contracts en 
tered into by minors are void 
able.

Ell CONTRACTS

D. Rogers, because by returning the
car to Auto, Rogers properly
disaffirmed the contract.

81.

80. Assume in this question, that Rogers
disaffirmed the contract on September
24, 1992, without making any pay 
ments, and failed to return the automo 
bile. After nine months of investigation,
Auto finds the car parked in an aban 
doned lot. Auto takes possession of the
car and sells the car at a public action
for $1,200, leaving a deficiency. Auto
brings suit against Rogers for the
amount of the deficiency. Auto will:

A. Prevail, because Rogers did not

return the automobile.

B. Prevail, because the automobile
was not returned and was found
nine months later.

C. Prevail, because the automobile
was not found until after Rogers
reached the age of majority.

D. Not prevail, because a contract

by an infant is voidable.

In June 1992, Mrs. Fletcher was trans 
ferred by her employer from Denver,
Colorado to Lompoc, California. In
looking for a house for her family, she
consulted a local real estate agency. Mr.
Caldwell of that agency showed Mrs.
Fletcher several homes, including Mr.
Tibbs' home. Mr. Tibbs' property was
located a short distance from where
Mrs. Fletcher's new office was located.
The home obtained its water supply
from a well located on the property. Mr.
Tibbs received information indicating
that the well was contaminated after
Mrs. Fletcher had looked at the house.
Mrs. Fletcher had Mr. Caldwell write
up an offer for Mr. Tibbs' property. Mr.
Tibbs accepted the offer, and did not
disclose the information about the con 
taminated well. After escrow closed,
Mrs. Fletcher moved into the property
and discovered that the well was con 
taminated. Mrs. Fletcher now brings
suit to rescind the contract. The court
will find for:

A. Mr. Tibbs, because there was no
duty to disclose newly- discov 
ered information.

B. Mr. Tibbs, because escrow
closed, releasing him from any
further obligations.

C. Mrs. Fletcher, because Mr. Tibbs
failed to disclose the contami 
nated well.

D. Mrs. Fletcher, but she can only

recover money damages.

CONTRACTS iii

82. Kemper submitted a bid to City to do
piping work for a sewer project. The
City requires that ten percent of the bid
price be posted as a bond, in favor of
the City, guaranteeing that the bidder
would do the job for the bid price if
awarded the contract. Kemper gave a
bid at $780,305. Three competing bids
were $1,049,592, $1,183,000, and
$1,278,895. Kemper discovered a few
hours later, after the bids were opened,
that there was a $301,769 error in his
computations, in which he relied upon
in making the bid. Kemper explained
the error to City and withdrew his bid,
but City accepted the bid anyway.

Kemper refuses to enter into a contract
with City at the mistaken bid price.
Kemper sued to rescind the bid. Kemper
will:

A. Prevail, because Kemper made

a material mistake.

B. Prevail, because City would be
unjustly enriched if Kemper has
to perform.

Questions 83 - 85 are based on the
following facts:

Bob purchased 100 bolts oflightweight wool
fabric of No.1 quality from Dan. Their con 
tract required Bob to pay for the fabric prior
to inspection. The 100 bolts were shipped,
and Bob made payment to Dan. Upon his
inspection, Bob discovered that the wool was
No.2 quality. Bob tendered back the wool
to Dan, and demanded return of his payment.
Dan refused on the ground that there is no
difference between No.1 quality wool and
No.2 quality wool.

83. Which of the following statements re 
garding the contract provision for
pre-inspection payment is correct?

A.

It constitutes an acceptance of
the goods.

B.

It constitutes a waiver of the
buyer's remedy of private sale in
the case of nonconforming
goods.

C.

It does not impair a buyer's right
of inspection or his remedies.

C. Not prevail, because City relied

on the bid.

D. It is invalid.

D. Not prevail, because once a bid
is submitted, it cannot be with 
drawn.

84. What is Bob's remedy because the wool

was nonconforming?

A. Specific performance.

mCONTRACTS

B. Damages measured by the differ 
ence between the value of the
goods delivered and the value of
conforming goods.

C. Damages measured by the price
paid, plus the difference between
the contract price and the cost of
buying substitute goods.

D. None, since he waived his rem 
edies by agreeing to pay before
inspection.

85. Can Bob resell the wool?

A. Yes, in a private sale.

B. Yes, in a private sale- but only
after giving Dan reasonable no 
tice of his intention to resell.

C. Yes, but only at a public sale.

D. No, because such an act is incon 
sistent with the claim such goods
were nonconforming.

Questions 86 - 87 are based on the
following facts:

Nancy and Melissa, both legal secretaries for
the Shiester & Shiester law film, enrolled in
the firm's voluntary computer program. This
program opted for each to purchase a com 
puter, for daily training during their lunch
hours. Nancy bought an inexpensive system.
Melissa spent $4,000 for the best system
available. After three months, Nancy discov 
ered that she enjoyed working on her com 
puter so much that she would even come in
to work on weekends. Melissa really wasn't
enthusiastic; in fact, Melissa only worked
on her computer about once a week. When
Melissa learned of how much Nancy enjoyed
working on the computer, she wrote Nancy
a memo offering to sell her computer. The
memo stated, "I am not a computer buff; if
you will pick up the computer at my office
before or after work, I will sell it to you for
$1,000. I will not revoke this offer."

Nancy knew a deal when she heard one, and
sent a letter to Melissa on Tuesday stating,
"I accept your offer and will pick up the com 
puter on friday at 7:00 a.m."

The next day, Melissa learns in her employee
evaluation conference, that if she becomes
competent on the computer, she will receive
a large salary increase.

Nancy comes to Melissa's office at 7:00 a.m.
on friday. Melissa refuses to sell Nancy the
computer.

CONTRACTS ED

86. Nancy brings an action for breach of
contract against Melissa. What is the
legal effect of Nancy's letter accepting
Melissa's offer to sell the computer?

A. It is an ineffective attempt by
Nancy to accept Melissa's offer.

B. A unilateral contract was created,
when Nancy mailed the letter.

C.

It constituted notice to Melissa
that Nancy would buy the com 
puter.

D. A bilateral contract was created
when Melissa received the letter.

87. What is the effect of Melissa's promise

not to revoke the offer?

A. It prevents Melissa from revok 

ing the offer.

B.

It has no effect because Melissa
did not state a date for termina 
tion.

C.

It has no effect.

D. It prevents any implied revoca 

tion.

III CONTRACTS

Questions 88 - 90 are based on the
following facts:

On April 1, Tim offered to sell his prize mare,
Midnight, to Marty for $10,000. Marty
handed Tim a $100 bill. In return, Tim
handed Marty a written statement which in 
cluded the offer and also included, that Tim
promised not to revoke the offer for a 60 
day period. Tim signed the offer. Both Tim
and Marty are in the horse breeding busi 
ness.

On April 5, 1993, Marty wrote a letter to
Tim which stated, "I cannot afford to pay
more than $8,000 for the mare. If you can 
not accept the $8,000, I cannot purchase the
horse."

Tim had already sold Midnight to Melinda
on April 4, 1993. Marty was unaware of the
sale.

On April 15, 1993, Marty discovered he
would receive a tax refund. He immediately
wrote to Tim. His letter stated, "I accept your
offer to purchase Midnight, your prize mare,
for $10,000."

88.

IfMarty sues Tim for damages, the most
likely outcome will be:

A. A contract was formed because
Tim was precluded from selling
Midnight to another party.

B. A contract was formed because
acceptance any time during the
60 days was effective.

C. Marty's letter of April 5, 1993,
prevented a contract from being
formed.

D. There was no formation of a con 
tract because Tim's prior sale of
Midnight to a third party, re 
voked his original offer.

89. Assume that Tim did not sell Midnight
to another party until April 10, 1993,
after receiving Marty's letter of April
5, 1993, and that Marty learned of the
sale on April 14, 1993. Marty's power
to accept the offer would be:

A. Good for 60 days, because Marty
paid $100 for a 60-day option.

B. Terminated on April 14, 1993.

C. Terminated, when Tim received
Marty's April 5, 1993 letter.

D. Terminated, when Tim sold Mid 

night.

90. What if Marty's letter dated April 5,
1993, contained a check for $10,000
and stated "I am going on vacation and
will pick the mare up in 30 days. I will
pay for any board and necessary care."
The letter is:

A. A counter-offer because it
changes the terms of the origi 
naloffer.

B. A counter-offer because it was

not definite.

C. An acceptance, and Tim must

board the mare.

D. An acceptance, and Tim may

refuse to board the mare.

91. Matt began working for Morrocam
Food Supply Company in 1969. Matt
agreed to work at a pay rate below union
scale, in exchange for a promise that
Morrocam would employ him "for
life." In 1987, Sansabar took over man 
agement of Morrocam Food Supply
Company. Sansabar assured Morrocam
employees that existing employment
contracts would be honored. Matt went
to a Sansabar supervisor and explained
the terms of his employment agreement.
The supervisor stated that he would
look into the matter, but never got back
to Matt. After 18 years of service, Matt
was fired by the new owners of the busi 
ness. Matt brings suit for breach of a
contract. Matt will most likely:

A. Win, because if the requirement
of consideration is met, there is
no additional requirement for
enforcing the contract.

B. Win, because Matt agreed to
work below scale in exchange
for lifetime employment.

C. Lose, because traditional law did
not uphold unilateral contracts.

D. Lose, because you cannot prom 
ise to employ someone for life.

92. Gil Glass Merchant and Wally Glass
Wholesalers had been doing business
with each other for 30 years. As was
his custom, Gil phoned Wally and
placed an order of 1200 glasses to be
delivered in sets of 100, one set each
month. The glasses were $5 each. Af 
ter Wally delivered the first set, Gil sent
Wally a check for $500 and a letter stat 
ing, "$5 a glass is too high; cancel the
remainder of my order, Wally." Wally
sues Gil for breach of contract. Gil
pleads the Statute of Frauds as a de 
fense. The most likely outcome will be
that:

A. Wally prevails, because 100
glasses have been received by
Gil.

B. Wally prevails, because the note
constituted a writing sufficient to
satisfy the Statute of Frauds.

Questions 93 - 94 are based on the
following facts:

Con, a general contractor, was commis 
sioned to build a new motel. Con took bids
from several sub-contractors for the plumb 
ing. John submitted a bid for $80,000. The
next lowest bid was $85,000. The remain 
ing bids ranged between $86,000 to $87,
500. Con gave the contract to John on March
1,1993. Work was to begin on April 1, 1993.
One week before John was to begin work 
ing, he discovered that he had made an error
in his calculations. John immediately called
Con and told him that he had made a mis 
take and the bid should have been $84,000,
instead of $80,000. John refuses to work,
unless Con agrees to pay $84,000.

93. Con refuses to pay the additional
amount to John and brings suit for
breach of contract. The court will most
likely rule for:

C. Gil prevails, because he repudi 
ated the remaining contract.

A. Con, because John is bound by a

valid contract.

D. Gil prevails, because the note
does not satisfy the Statute of
Frauds.

B. Con, but only if he neither knew
nor could have known of the
mistake in calculations of the bid.

C. John, because his obligation is

discharged.

D. John, because time of perfor 

mance was not due.

ED CONTRACTS

94. Assume Con, being in a hurry to get
the work started, stated to John he
would pay the additional amount. Af 
ter John completes performance, Con
gives John a check for $80,000 and re 
fuses to pay the additional $4,000. The
most likely result will be:

A. John will not prevail because of
the obligation to perform the
work for $80,000.

B. John will not prevail, unless Con
never intended to pay the addi 
tional $4,000.

C. John will prevail because he in 
tended to work only for the
amount of $84,000.

D. John will prevail because the
parties mutually agreed to the
second contract.

95. Sterling, a merchant, deals in rare coins.
Sterling took out an insurance policy
from "Gouge Em" Insurance Company,
covering the coins Sterling had in stock
in his coin shop. There was a written
provision in the policy which stated all
records describing the coins were to be
kept off the store premises in a place
where they would not be stolen.

Sterling was updating his records, since
he had received new inventory. He de 
cided to finish the records the next day.
He went home and left the records in
the coin shop. The shop was robbed that
night. All the coins and the records of
the coins were stolen. "Gouge Em" re 
fuses to pay on the policy. Sterling
brings suit to recover on the policy. He
will most likely:

A. Not prevail, because Sterling
breached the contract by leaving
the records in the coin shop.

B. Not prevail, because the policy
specifically stated the records
must be stored in a safe place.

C. Prevail, because the provision in
the policy regarding the records
has been reasonably satisfied.

D. Prevail, because of the unfairness

of the provision.

CONTRACTS m

D. Yes, because Jim's act of mail 
ing the signed contract was an
effective acceptance.

97. Assume that during the April 3, 1993
telephone conversation, Rod stated,
"I'm glad you aren't going to buy my
Model T Ford, I really don't want to
part with it; I cancel my offer." Does
Jim have an enforceable contract to
purchase the Model T Ford from Rod?

A. No, because Jim stated his intent
to rescind any contract, and Rod
accepted the offer to rescind.

B. No, because there was no mani 
festation of contractual intent.

C. Yes, because you cannot rescind

a contract.

D. Yes, because no valid consider 
ation for rescission occurred.

Questions 96 - 97 are based on the
following facts:

Rod and Jim have been friends for many
years. Both collect antique cars. Rod had
acquired a Model T Ford that Jim felt was
the most exquisite Model T he had ever seen.
Jim, on several occasions, asked Rod if he
could purchase it. Rod did not want to part
with the car. Jim then stated, "If you ever
decide to sell the car, I want to buy it." On
April 1, 1993, Rod realized he was short on
cash and would not be able to pay his taxes.
He drafted a contract for the sale of his
Model T Ford to Jim. He mailed the con 
tract to Jim the same day. Jim received the
contract on April 3, 1993. He was so excited
that he signed it, and mailed it back the same
day. Later that day, Jim's accountant in 
formed him that he was broke. Jim immedi 
ately called Rod and told him to ignore the
signed contract when he received it, because
he was no longer in the financial position to
purchase the car. Rod received the signed
contract in the mail on April 5, 1993.

96. Can Rod enforce the contract for the
sale of his Model T Ford to Jim?

A. No, because Jim communicated
his retraction before Rod re 
ceived the signed contract in the
mail.

B. No, because the mail is not a re 
liable source of communication.

C. Yes, because Jim made his re 
traction by phone instead of by
mail.

ED CONTRACTS

Questions 98 - 100 are based on
the following facts:

Homeowner wanted to have the exterior of
his home repainted. He got out the yellow
pages, and called a number of established
painting firms. He received bids ranging
from $6,000 to $7,500. While trying to de 
cide on whom to use, Homeowner received
a call from Renoir, who submitted a bid to
do the work for $5,500. Homeowner entered
into a contract with Renoir to have the exte 
rior of his home painted. The work was to
begin on January 1, 1993. On December 30,
1992, Renoir called Homeowner and stated,
"My foreman made a mistake in adding the
figures. I can't possibly do the work for less
than $6,100, or I will lose money."

98. If Homeowner sues Renoir for breach

of contract, who prevails?

A. Renoir, because he had not

started painting.

B. Renoir, because of the defense of

mistake.

C. Homeowner, unless he can still
accept the bid of the next lowest
bidder.

D. Homeowner, only if he had no
reason to know of Renoir's er-
ror.

99. Assume that Homeowner responded to
Renoir's statement of an error in his bid
by stating, "I'll pay the extra money,
but I really think it's unfair." After
Renoir finished painting Homeowner's
home, Homeowner tenders a check for
$5,500 to Renoir. If Renoir brings suit
for the additional $600, the court will
most likely rule for:

A. Homeowner, because he did not
put his promise to pay the extra
$600 in a valid writing.

B. Homeowner, because Renoir
was under a pre-existing duty to
paint the house for $5,500.

C. Renoir, because he detrimentally
relied on Homeowner's promise
to pay the additional $600.

D. Renoir, because public policy
enforcing

would mandate
Renoir's promise to pay.

100. Assume that Homeowner responded to
Renoir's statement of an error in his
bid by stating, "I'll pay the extra
money if you also paint the inside of
my garage and all the plant boxes in
the back yard." Renoir agrees. After
Renoir completes the painting of the
exterior of the home, the garage and
the plant boxes, Homeowner tenders
a check for $5,500, refusing to pay the
additional $600. If Renoir brings suit
for the additional $600, who will pre 
vail?

CONTRACTS III

A. Homeowner, because Renoir
was under a pre-existing duty to
paint the house for $5,500.

D. Lose, because contractor could
demand "assurance of perfor 
mance."

B. Homeowner, because the prom 

ise was not in writing.

e. Renoir, because there was a valid
modification of the contract.

D. Renoir, because he detrimentally
relied on Homeowner's promise.

101. Sub-contractor agrees to install the
plumbing in a motel being contracted
by Contractor. Three days before Sub 
contractor is to begin work, contrac 
tor learns that Sub-contractor's em 
ployees went on strike. Contractor de 
mands Sub-contractor to explain how
he will perform the plumbing work.
When Sub-contractor does not explain,
contractor withholds an advance pay 
ment due to Sub-contractor, under the
terms of the contract, and hires a dif 
ferent sub-contractor to perform the
plumbing work. Sub-contractor sues
contractor for breach of contract. Sub 
contractor will most likely:

A. Prevail, because the u.e.e. does

not apply to services.

B. Prevail, because he intended to

do the work himself.

C. Lose, because another sub-con 

tractor finished the work.

Harley allowed his 20 year-old-son, Crash,
to drive his motorcycle to school one day.
Crash negligently changed lanes, and struck
Betty, a cyclist, who was turning the comer.
Betty and Crash were both severely injured.
Harley believed he was liable for Crash's
accident because he was the owner of the
motorcycle. Harley went to see Betty in the
hospital and assured her that he would pay
for her medical expenses and any losses she

Questions 107 -109 are based on
the following facts:

In 1980, Isac took out a life insurance policy
for $100,000. The policy stated that the in 
sured had power to change the beneficiary
and to assign the policy. In 1990, Isac named
his wife as the beneficiary. Wife did not
know of the insurance policy. In 1991, Isac
changed the beneficiary from his wife to his
only daughter, from another marriage. Isac
wrote the daughter and informed her of the
policy. In 1992, Isac borrowed $10,000 and
assigned the policy to an assignee as secu 
rity. Isac died in 1993.

107. Wife learns of the insurance policy and
sues insurance company to collect the
proceeds. Wife will:

A. Not prevail, because she was not

the intended beneficiary.

B. Not prevail, because she was not

the incidental beneficiary.

C. Prevail, because public policy
would warrant a wife being pro 
vided for.

D. Prevail, because Wife is a donee

beneficiary.

108. Daughter sues Insurance Company to

collect the proceeds. Daughter will:

A. Not prevail, because the wife
will be entitled to the insurance
proceeds.

B. Not prevail, because Isac bor 

rowed against the policy.

C. Prevail, because she is his only

daughter.

D. Prevail, as the donee beneficiary.

109. Assignee sues the insured for the
$10,000 that Isac borrowed. Daughter
intervenes. The court will most likely
hold for:

A. Daughter, because she is the
named beneficiary and thus pre 
vails over any assignee.

B. Daughter, because she is a donee
beneficiary; thus, a promisee can
not assign any part of the
beneficiary's right, once they
know of the contract.

C. Assignee, because Isac reserved
the right to change the benefi 
ciary and to assign the policy.

D. Assignee, because there was
consideration given for the as 
signment.

ary 1993, Jag orally agreed to supply Jaguar
automobiles at 15% below factory cost. Jag
immediately sent a written confirmation. Cat
Imports never received the written confir 
mation from Jag. In February 1993, Cathy
and Tim had several major disagreements.
Tim decided to terminate the business rela 
tionship. He executed a document assign 
ing all of his rights in Cat's Imports to Cathy.
Cathy, in return, agreed to be solely liable

voice showing a balance owing of $90,000.
Cathy sent Jag a check for $76,500, marked
"payment in full". Cathy also enclosed a let 
ter stating that Jag had not deducted the 15%
discount. Jag sent a letter demanding the
additional $13,500, but deposited the
$76,500 check into their account. Jag also
stated that the 15% agreement was invalid
because Tim had left the business.

112. Jag brings suit against Cat Imports for
$13,500, asserting the statute of frauds
as a defense. Jag will most likely:

ceived the written confirmation
from Jag.

B. Prevail, because the sale of
goods in excess of $500 must be
evidenced by a sufficient writing.

C. Not prevail, because of the Pa 

rol Evidence Rule.

D. Not prevail, because Cat's pro 
test letter is a sufficient writing.

113. Assume that Jag brings a suit for
$13,500. Cat's best argument would
be:

A. Accord and Satisfaction.

B. Promissory Estoppel.

C. Novation.

D. Implied Novation.

amount still owing. Tim's best argu 
ment would be:

A. There was a valid accord and

satisfaction.

B. The Statute of Frauds was vio 

lated.

C. There was an implied novation.

D. None of the above.

115. Assume for this question, that Cat Im 
ports has orders for 10 cars at the dis 
counted price, and the court finds that
a valid contract exists, requiring Jag
to supply the cars at a 15% discount.
What are Cats' remedies:

146. Tom purchases a restaurant, secured by
purchase money financing. The restau 
rant needs a new air conditioning sys 
tem. Tom, short of cash, purchases the
air conditioning system from Earl's Air
Systems, on credit. Earl's takes a se 
curity interest in the equipment sold
to Tom and timely files a security in 
terest under Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code.

Tom fails to pay for the equipment and
goes bankrupt. Earl's claims a priority
interest in the system over Tom's other
creditors. The bankruptcy trustee
claims an interest in the system for the
benefit of all creditors. Whose interest
in the system has priority?

A. All the general creditors, because
they are owed money from Tom
for supplies sold to Tom on credit
for the restaurant.

B. Earl's, because any supplier of
fixtures sold on credit has a se 
cured interest in the fixture until
paid for.

C. Earl's, because of Earl's per 
fected security interest in the
equipment.

D. Neither Earl nor the creditors,
because once the equipment was
installed, it became realty.

Questions 144 -145 are based on
the following facts:

Buyer sends an order for 10,000 #A tennis
balls to Manufacturing Company, with in 
structions to ship immediately.

144. Manufacturer ships immediately, via
common carrier. Later that day, Buyer
wires a revocation of his order. Is there
an enforceable contract?

A. Yes,undertheU.C.C.

B. Yes, under the "mirror image"

rule.

C. No, because Buyer made a

timely revocation.

D. No, because manufacturer can
sell the balls to someone else.

145. Assume Manufacturer was out of #A
balls, and shipped #B balls. Is there a
contract?

A. No, because the goods were non 

conforming.

B. No, because the #B balls consti 

tute a breach.

C. Yes, because it is only an accom 

modation.

D. Yes, because shipment is an ac 

ceptance.

147. Sam's Sugar Company ("Sam") sells
Bob's Export Foods ("Bob") five thou 
sand 100 pound bags of sugar. Bob
placed the order on his own order form
by filling in the description and quan 
tity of the goods. In the space for price,
Bob wrote: "FOB PLANT PER 100
POUND BAG $15.25."

Because the sugar was being shipped
overseas, Sam agreed to load up Bob's
shipping container with the sugar. The
loaded container was stolen from
Sam's plant before Bob's carrier was
able to pick it up. Sam sues Bob for
the contract price when Bob refuses to
pay. Who prevails?

A. Sam, since he had already loaded
up the shipping container for
overseas transport.

B. Sam, because the parties had
"agreed otherwise" to pass the
risk of loss at the time and place
the shipping container was
loaded.

C. Bob, because the risk of loss can 
not pass when identified goods
have been stolen - although nei 
ther party is at fault.

D. Bob, because the term "FOB
PLANT" requires delivery to the
carrier before the risk of loss
passes.

148. John collects antique cars as an invest 
ment. In 1992, John purchased a home
and assumes the existing mortgage
with Bank. Excited about his new
home, John purchases lumber on credit
from Hardware Store to build a larger
garage for his car collection.
Hardware's credit application states
that it has a secured interest in the lum 
ber until the goods are paid for.

After completing his new garage, John
defaults on his debts to Hardware and
Bank. Which party's claimed interest
in the lumber prevails?

A. Bank, if its secured interest in the

realty is first in time.

B. Bank, since the lumber was or 
dinary building materials.

C. Hardware, if it filed its security
interest in the lumber prior to
construction of the garage.

D. Hardware, because the lumber
became a fixture upon incorpo 
ration into the construction of the
garage.

CONTRACTS III

A. FRU, because it filed its security
interest within the 21-day grace
period.

B. FRU, because a fixture financier
is entitled to a security interest
when it extends credit.

C.

Intrastate, due to its pre-existing
security interest in the motel.

D. Intrastate, since FRU failed to
file its security interest within the
Article 9 grace period.

151. When the medical profession conclu 
sively proved that tanning by artificial
lighting is not harmful to humans, tan 
ning salons became the method of
choice for that "bronzed look."
Hamilton George invested all his
money to open up a tanning salon sup 
ply store, to profit from the surge in
salon business.

George sold his tanning equipment on
credit, which he also installed for his
customers. The equipment was affixed
to the realty of his customers' busi 
nesses.

Questions 149 -150 are based on
the following facts:

Matt's Motel ("Matt") purchases a new fur 
nace on credit from Furnace R Us ("FRU")
which FRU installs the same day. There is a
preexisting mortgage on the motel through
Intrastate Bank ("Intrastate"). FRU files its
security interest in the furnace three weeks
after the sale to Matt. Matt then takes out a
second mortgage with Continental Bank
("Continental"). Matt defaults on all his
debts before they are repaid.

149. Whose interest in the furnace has pri 
ority between FRU and Continental?

A. FRU, because FRU's security
interest was filed before Conti 
nental recorded its mortgage.

B. FRU, because its security inter 
est was filed within the 21-day
grace period after installation of
the fixture.

C. Continental, since FRU did not
file its security interest within the
grace period, in order to have
priority over a subsequent inter 
est.

D. Continental, because the furnace
became realty which is subject
to a mortgagee's claim.

150. Whose security interest prevails be 

tween FRU and Intrastate?

l1li CONTRACTS

George attempted to file a secured in 
terest in some tanning equipment sold
and installed for Jeff. Because George
was unfamiliar with the filing process,
he misidentified some of the equip 
ment in the financing statement. He
filed the financing statement without
discovering his error. Is the filing ef 
fective?

A. No, an erroneous filing is never

effective.

B. No, because unfamiliarity is no
excuse for George's mistake.

C. No, except as to the extent the

descriptions were proper.

D. Yes, because George's attempt to
file the security interest was in
goodfaith, even though he did
not pay the filing fee.

Questions 152 - 153 are based on
the following facts:

Chuck's Corvette Cafe was constructed on
a corner of Pacific Coast Highway,
in
Malibu. His indoor cafe was known for its
authentic Corvette-replica "booths", where
customers ordered and were served much
like the drive-up restaurants ofthe 60's. The
booths, were purchased from Bob's Booths
and were affixed to the restaurant building.
Bob properly files his security interest in the
booths.

Rock slides along the highway are a con 
stant problem for customers attempting to
reach the cafe and the cafe closes for lack of
business. Unable to pay his bills, Chuck de 
faults on his debt to Bob. Bob immediately
takes back the booths. Because the cafe
doors were too small to permit removal of
the booths, Bob smashes a large window to
extract the booths.

152. Were Bob's actions proper in repos 

sessing the booths?

A. Yes, he had timely obtained a
secured interest in the fixtures
prior to repossession.

B. Yes, because Bob had the right
to repossession without resort to
the judicial process.

C. No, because Bob breached the
peace in order to repossess the
booths.

153. Assume Bob's conduct was proper in
removing the booths, must he reim-
burse Chuck for the damage to the
cafe?

A. Yes, for the diminution in value

to the cafe.

B. Yes, for the repair cost for the

cafe.

C. Yes, for either the diminution in
value or repair cost, whichever

D. No, because Chuck is the debtor.

154. Tina's Toucans sells exotic tropical
birds. Pam purchases a toucan, Sam,
for $1,000 from Tina. Tina's sales con-
tract with Pam conspicuously states,
"HEALTH GUARANTEE FOR 72

CHASE. EXCHANGES WILL BE
PERMITTED ONLY UPON PRE-
SENTATION OF VETERINAR-
IAN' S REPORT WITHIN THE
72-HOUR PERIOD. NOT RESPON-
SIBLE FOR INJURY, ACCIDENT

Pam had Sam examined the next day
by a veterinarian, but no disease or de-
fect was discovered. However, 3 weeks
later, Sam died for no apparent reason.
An autopsy of the toucan could not
identify the cause of death. Pam asks
Tina to replace her bird, but Tina re-
fuses. Pam sues Tina to recover her
purchase price. What is the most likely
result?

A. Tina loses, because she failed to
disclaim the implied warranty of
merchantability.

B. Tina loses, because the 72 hours
is not sufficient time to discover
defects or disease in a bird.

C. Pam loses, because she could not
prove Sam's cause of death.

D. Pam loses, because the implied
warranties of merchantability
and fitness for intended use were
expressly disclaimed.

118 CONTRACTS

3. D is the best answer. Tammy encoun 
tered no legal detriment; thus, she
would not prevail on this theory. A could
be an applicable theory for Tammy as
modern law holds that if a donative
promise induces reliance by the prom 
isee in a manner that the promisor
should reasonably have expected, the
promise will be legally enforceable. B,
although a good choice (the traditional
rule holds that a promise based on moral
obligation is unenforceable), is not the
best answer because the rule is pres 
ently, in a growing minority of juris 
dictions, modified. C is incorrect be 
cause in some circumstances the courts
have enforced a gratuitous promise that
foreseeably induced reliance.

4. A is the best answer. The general rule
is that a donative promise is unenforce 
able because there is a lack of consid 
eration. B is a correct statement, unless
the promise becomes enforceable and
is therefore, not the best answer. C is
an incorrect statement because there
was no bargained for exchange. D is an
incorrect statement of the law.

CONTRACTSANSWERS

1. D is the correct answer. A written letter
of confirmation, sent by a merchant
within a reasonable time after the oral
contract is made, will satisfy the statue
of frauds, if the receiving party is a
merchant and does not object to the
contents thereof within 10 days afterre 
ceipt. A is an incorrect statement be 
cause the parol evidence rule is only
applicable to alleged conditions of a
contract not included in the written con 
tract, itself. Such is not the situation
here. B is incorrect because the mer 
chant's exception, as discussed in D,
would make the statute of frauds inap 
plicable. C is an incorrect statement as
the merchant's exception does not re 
quire Jim's signature on the confirma 
tion form.

2.

0 is the correct answer. There was no
legal effect as to Tammy's exclamation,
since Mr. Baker had not made an offer
of any kind. A and B are incorrect be 
cause no offer was made, and there must
be a valid offer for there to be a bind 
ing acceptance or "meeting of the
minds." C is incorrect because no ex 
pressed qualifications were imposed
upon Tammy for her to receive the gift.

CONTRACTS am

7. C is the correct answer. A firm offer is
irrevocable without consideration for a
reasonable time, or for the time speci 
fied in the contract; but in no event for
a period of time longer than three
months. The offer must be made by a
merchant and involve the sale of goods.
A is incorrect since no consideration is
needed. B is incorrect, because the
u.e.e. holds firm offers open for three
months no longer. D is an incorrect
statement of law. Such is not required
by the u.e.C.

8. B is the correct answer. Dee's payment
of the lesser sum is not consideration
as the debt was undisputed. Therefore,
Mel's promise to accept the lesser sum
as payment in full is not enforceable. A
is an incorrect statement of law. C is
incorrect, because payment of the $400,
which was already owed, is not consid 
ered to be legal "consideration". D is
an incorrect answer for the same rea 
sons that B is correct.

5. A is the correct answer. Restatement
First §90 of Contracts, provides that a
promise which the promisor should rea 
sonably expect to induce action or for 
bearance and which does induce such,
is binding if injustice can be avoided
only by enforcement of the promise.
Here, it can be said that Mr. Baker
would have no reason to foresee the ac 
tion by Tammy; thus, his promise would
not be binding. D is incorrect because
it is not as concise as answer A. B is
incorrect because, whether or not Mr.
Baker intended reliance or not, is irrel 
evant to the applicable rule of law. C is
incorrect because it incorrectly states
the law. Tammy's conduct was not a
legal detriment and there was no bar 
gained for exchange.

6. B is the best answer. When a contract
calls for goods and services, the court
may apply the Predominant Purpose
Test. Under this test, if it is decided that
the predominant purpose of the contract
was for goods, then the Uniform Com 
mercial Code (U.C.e.) will apply. A is
incorrect because services are also in 
cluded; thus, the u.e.e. does not clearly
apply. C is incorrect, as the courts may,
under the Predominant Purpose Test,
decide that the u.e.e. applies. D is an
incorrect statement as the u.e.e. ap 
plies to goods, not services.

11m CONTRACTS

9. A is the correct answer. When there are
dealings between merchants, additional
or different terms become part of the
contract automatically after a reason 
able period of time, unless: 1) the offer
expressly limits acceptance to the terms
of the offer, 2) the additional or differ 
ent terms are a material alteration of the
offer, or 3) the original offeror notifies
the offeree that he objects to the addi 
tional or different terms within a com 
mercially reasonable period of time. B
is incorrect, as conduct by both parties
which recognizes the existence of a
contract, is sufficient to establish a con 
tract. C is incorrect for the reasons dis 
cussed in answer A. D is incorrect be 
cause the additional terms were likely
not significant to constitute a counter 
offer.

10. C is the correct answer. When a non 
merchant offeree proposes additional or
different terms in his acceptance, a con 
tract exists consisting of the terms
agreed upon, while the additional terms
are deemed a proposal for additional or
different terms. A is incorrect for the
same reasons that C is correct. B is in 
correct because the additional terms
would merely be considered proposals.
D is incorrect, since C is correct.

11. Under the U.c.c., D is the correct an 
swer. Where no place is specified for
delivery of the goods, the place of de 
livery is the seller's place of business,
or, if there is none, the seller's resi 
dence. Answers A, B, and C are all in 
correct for the reason stated in the cor 
rect answer D.

12. C is the correct answer. A unilateral
contract is one where an offer requires
performance of an act as bargained-for
consideration. The unilateral contract is
formed by doing the required act. A is
incorrect since a bilateral contract re 
quires an exchange of promises. B is
factually incorrect because the reward
was not intended as negotiation. D is
an incorrect statement, since a bilateral
contract requires an agreement prior to
the performance-which was not the case
here.

13. D is the correct answer. A reward offer
must be accepted by an offeree who
knows of the offer. Here, Annie did not
learn of the reward until after Fido's
return. A and B are incorrect for the rea 
sons discussed in correct answer D. C
is not correct because the issue is not
consideration, but whether or not the
offeree knew of the offer.

14. D is the correct answer. Anticipatory
repudiation does not apply in a contract
fully performed on the side of the
non-repudiating party.

CONTRACTS III

18. D is the best answer. Brent must notify
Selma of the rejection within a reason 
able time and must hold the goods with
reasonable care for a reasonable time
sufficient for Selma to remove the
goods. A is incorrect, as Brent is under
no obligation to send the roller blades
back. Answers Band C are incorrect as
Brent only need fulfill the requirements
discussed in correct answer D.

19. A is the correct answer. Incidental dam 
ages allow the buyer to recover any cost
or expense reasonably incurred which
are incidental to the seller's delay or
delivery of defective goods. Loss of
expected profit is not considered to be
an incidental damage and is, therefore,
not recoverable. Answers B, C and D
are all incorrect, as they all constitute
incidental damages and could be recov 
ered. CU.C.c. §2-8l5(l))

15. A is the best answer. The agreement
expressly stated that the motorcycle was
to be delivered on September 9. B is
not the best answer, since implied con 
ditions deal with fairness and justice. A
is a more concise answer. C is not the
best answer, since the delivery was not
an event which impliedly had to occur
to create an absolute duty to perform.
D is incorrect because the performances
were not mutually dependent.

16. A is the correct answer. u.C.C. §2-613
states that if the contract involves goods
that were identified when the contract
was made and the goods are destroyed
without fault of either party before the
risk of loss passed, the contract is
voided. B, C and D are incorrect for the
same reasons that A is correct.

17. D is the correct answer. A party bears
the risk of a mistake when he is aware
at the time that the contract is made,
that he has only limited knowledge with
respect to the facts to which the mis 
take relates-but treats his limited knowl 
edge as sufficient. In this case, Flint is
obligated to build the mall and pay the
increased costs. Flint assumed the risks
when it started the job. A is incorrect
because Flint's mistake will not excuse
its performance. B is incorrect, as
Rubble is not obligated to share in the
increased costs. C is an incorrect state 
ment. Although it will cut into Flint's
profits, the contract is not impracticable
to perform.

lEI CONTRACTS

20. C is the correct answer. An express
warranty can be created by any sample
or model which is made part of the ba 
sis of the bargain. Here, the demonstra 
tion would create an express warranty
that the curling iron shall conform to
the model used. Thus, the fact that it
took 2 minutes to curl her hair instead
of the 30 seconds, would be a breach of
the express warranty. A is an incorrect
statement oflaw. Under u.e.e. §2-318,
direct privity between the manufacturer
and the ultimate buyer is not required
for there to be a cause of action. B is
incorrect because this warranty requires
that the seller have reason to know of
the particular use of goods contem 
plated by the buyer, and the seller must
also be aware that the buyer is relying
on the seller's judgment. The facts do
not support the finding ofthose conclu 
sions. D is incorrect for the same rea 
sons that C is correct.

21. D is the correct answer. The mayor has
detrimentally relied. This satisfies the
requirement of vesting. A is incorrect
(although this answer could possibly
make sense if the subcontractor was
suing for the loss of use of some gift
arguably donated to him). B is incor 
rect because to be a creditor beneficiary,
there must be detrimental reliance or a
suit brought on the contract. An ad 
vancement of salary is not necessarily
detrimental reliance- it is consideration.
C is incorrect because it is not the best
answer.

22. D is the correct answer. For the general
contractor to be able to indemnify him 
self, there must obviously be a valid
contract between himself and the sub 
contractor. A is incorrect. A general con 
tractor is responsible for the breach of
independent contractors. Mayor can sue
general contractor. B is incorrect as the
subcontractor could be seen as an obli 
gor; however, this bears no relation on
whether Mayor can sue the general con 
tractor. C is incorrect, as this bears no
relation to the suit between the subcon 
tractor and the general contractor.

23. C is the correct answer. Girkin is an in 
cidental beneficiary. A is incorrect, as
Girkin is not an intended beneficiary.
B is incorrect. An officious inter 
meddler is a remedies issue- this answer
would make no sense here. D is incor 
rect. Rights of the third party benefi 
ciary can be cut off up to the time that
they have vested. Here, there are no
vested rights. Girkin is merely an inci 
dental beneficiary.

CONTRACTS IE

24. B is the correct answer. If the subcon 
tractor has made partial performance or
a substandard performance, Mayor had
the right to offset against any incom 
pleteness to the performance ofthe con 
tract. Also, Mayor could actually be
owed damages, if she has been placed
in a position that is worse than before
the subcontractor performed the duty
under the contract. A is incorrect. The
general contractor's actions are not re 
lated to the suit between Mayor and the
general contractor. C is incorrect as "le 
gal detriment" refers to action of the
promisee taken in reliance upon the
actions of the promisor. D is an incor 
rect statement of law.

25. D is the correct answer. The communi 
cation between the parties has not yet
reached a point where vesting could
occur in Girkin. A is incorrect. Girkin
has not bargained for legal detriment.
None of his actions show that he has
offered any consideration. Further, there
are no facts to indicate donative intent
exists toward Girkin. B is incorrect.
There was no promise on which Girkin
could reasonably rely. C is incorrect
because, if the parties know someone
has reasonably relied, there can be an
action for restitution, but no facts indi 
cate reliance in this case to be reason 
able.

1m CONTRACTS

26. B is the correct answer. Ped received
medical treatment from the doctor,
which implies a promise by Ped to pay
for the services received. Answers C
and D are incorrect because the status
of Doctor as a beneficiary would give
him the right to sue Axel, not Ped. C is
incorrect because quasi-contractual re 
covery is not the best recovery, and also
is not the best theory of recovery be 
cause an implied-in-fact contract exists.

27. A is the correct answer, because Doc 
tor could only proceed against Axel as
a third party beneficiary of the Ped-Axel
contract. B is an incorrect statement of
law. C is incorrect because Axel's det 
rimental reliance on Ped's release has
no relevance to Doctor's right ofrecov 
ery. D is an incorrect statement of law.

28. B is the correct answer. Grease only
promised to represent Ped. This prom 
ise did not confer third party beneficiary
status on Doctor. A is incorrect because,
whether Doctor's rights have vested or
not, is irrelevant to this fact-pattern. C
is incorrect because there are no facts
to support this contention. D is incor 
rect because Doctor is not a beneficiary
of Grease's promise.

29. C is the correct answer. A promise "not
to assign" will not prevent an assign 
ment. However, this does constitute a
breach of promise not to assign. For the
reasoning discussed in correct answer
C, A and B are both incorrect. D is in 
correct, since it is an incorrect statement
of law.

30. D is the correct answer (for Bar Exam
purposes). The Restatement II of Con-
tracts is followed where the terms
"creditor" and "donee" beneficiary (see
Restatement I) have been replaced with
the term "intended" beneficiary. (Note
that a majority of states still follow the
Restatement I, which results in a dif-
ferent answer.) A, B, and C are incor-
rect for the reasons D is correct.

31. B is the correct answer. Design Factory
is a beneficiary and, thus, subject to any
defenses which may arise. A is incor-
rect, as it misstates the law. C is incor-
rect because vesting is only at issue
when the original parties are trying to
change the beneficiary rights. D is an
incorrect statement of law.

32. C is the correct answer. There was no
enforceable rights at the time of the as-
signment because no enforceable con-
tract existed. Therefore, A and Dare
incorrect. B is incorrect because this
would not justify Soprano's recovery.

33. D is the correct answer. Whistler's as-
signment to Fork was a delegation of
his duty. Thus, when Fork performed,
Van Gogh's duty became absolute. A is
incorrect under these facts. B is incor-
rect because the assignment and delega-
tion act as a substitute for privity. C is
incorrect because that fact alone is not
enough to subject Van Gogh to liabil-
ity.

34. A is the correct answer. Every delega-
tion gives rise to a third-party benefi-
ciary contract. Therefore, Van Gogh has
a cause of action against Fork. B is in-
correct only because it is not the best
answer. C is incorrect because the facts
do not support the answer. D is incor-
rect because A is correct.

35. C is the correct answer. When a party
to a contract delegates their duty, they
remain liable as guarantor for the per-
formance of the delegatee. D is incor-
rect because there are not enough facts
to support this choice. A is incorrect be-
cause of the rule stated in answer C. B
is an incorrect statement of law.

36. B is the correct answer. Under UCC
Section 2-312, a warranty of title must
be disclaimed by specific language. The
provision for sale of "any right, title and
interest" is not an exclusion or dis-
claimer of the warranty of title. Further,
the provision disclaiming warranties is
ineffective as to title, for its failure to
disclaim the warranty of title specifi-
cally. A, C and D are incorrect for the
reasons stated in correct answer B.

37. A is the best answer. Ed made an ex-
press warranty to Joe, regarding specific
attributes of the boat that were not true.
B is incorrect because A is the better
answer. C and D are incorrect for the
reasons stated in the explanation to an-
swer A.

CONTRACTS IfD

38. A is the correct answer. Under uee
section 2-206, an offer may be accepted
by any reasonable medium. An offer
may be accepted by either a return
promise or by specific acts. Marine's
act of shipping the motors constituted
acceptance of Bill's offer. Band e are
incorrect because they are incorrect
statements of law. D is incorrect be 
cause Marine failed to give notice that
the shipment was an accommodation.

39. B is correct. uee Section 2-608 pro 
vides that a buyer may revoke or reject
the whole shipment, or accept any com 
mercial unit, and reject the rest. A is
incorrect because a buyer must give
notice within a reasonable time of re 
jection. e and D are incorrect state 
ments of law.

40. A is the correct answer. Under uee
section 2-205, an offer by a merchant,
in a signed writing which by its terms
gives assurances to keep the offer open,
is not revocable for a period not to ex 
ceed three months. B, e and D are in 
correct statements of law.

41. D is the correct answer. Under uee 2 
207(2), where parties to a contract for
the sale of goods are both merchants,
the proposed additional terms become
part of the contract unless: (1) the offer
expressly limits acceptance to the terms
of the offer; (2) the additional terms
would materially alter the contract; or
(3) the offeror notifies the offeree within
a reasonable period of time that he ob 
jects to the additional terms. Because
Grocer's response was an inquiry to
eanco's offer, the terms will be con 
strued as a proposal and will become
part of the contract. A, Band e are in 
correct for the reasons stated in correct
answer D.

42. e is the correct answer. uee 2-601 pro 
vides where goods or tender of deliv 
ery fails in any respect to conform to
the contract, the buyer may reject ten 
der (perfect tender rule). A is incorrect
because substantial performance does
not apply under the Uec. B is incor 
rect for the same reasons that answer A
is incorrect. D is incorrect because of
the perfect tender rule.

IE CONTRACTS

43. A is correct. uee 2-601 provides a
buyer may accept a non-conforming
tender. Under 2 -714, buyer's accep 
tance of partial tender does not operate
as a waiver and buyer can recover dam 
ages. B is incorrect because the materi 
ality of seller's breach is not decisive.
The buyer is entitled to recover dam 
ages for any unexcused failure. e is in 
correct because acceptance of partial
tender does not operate as a waiver. D
is incorrect because a non- conforming
shipment constitutes a breach.

44. D is the correct answer. As between
merchants, a written confirmation is
sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds,
unless written objection is given within
10 days of receipt. A, Band e are in 
correct statements of law.

45. e is the correct answer. Section 2-313
provides that any affirmation of fact or
promise, relating to the goods in which
a buyer could rely, creates an express
warranty. Since Robin had actual
knowledge of Martin's accident prior
to her purchase of the Forge, she could
not have relied on the express affirm 
ations by Forge in its brochure. A, B
and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in the explanation to answer C.

46. e is the correct answer. An offer of re 
ward is an offer for performance. Since
Ethel did not deliver the brief case, and
Smith effectively revoked the offer
when he informed Ethel that he was
canceling the reward, no contract was
formed. A is incorrect because Ethel
cannot orally accept the reward - a uni 
lateral contract can only be accepted by
performance and she has not returned
the brief case. B is incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in correct answer e. D is
incorrect because Smith effectively re 
voked the offer.

47. e is the correct answer. X's offer called
for acceptance by performance, so the
mailing of the letter by Y (a promise to
perform) had no legal effect. The mail 
box rule only applies to bilateral con 
tracts. When Y learned of X's prior pur 
chase, an indirect revocation took place.
Thus, no contract was formed. A is in 
correct since X's offer requires accep 
tance by performance. Band D are in 
correct for the same reasons that e is
correct

CONTRACTS 1m

48. D is the correct answer. An offeree's
power of acceptance is terminated when
the offeror takes definite action incon 
sistent with an intention to enter into
the proposed contract, and the offeree
has reliable information to that effect.
When Y learned of X's prior purchase
of the truck, Y had notice of X's con 
duct that was inconsistent with X's in 
tent to subsequently buy Y's truck. A
and B are incorrect for reasons stated
in correct answer D. C is an incorrect
statement of law because only an off 
eror has the power to terminate his of 
fer.

49. D is the correct answer. Because Dan
is not a party, nor an intended benefi 
ciary to the Jack-Bill agreement, Dan
cannot raise the argument that the Jack 
Bill agreement is not in writing as a
defense because he does not have stand 
ing to do so. Dan cannot assert the de 
fense that the Jack-Dan agreement is not
in writing because such agreement was
a construction/building contract that, by
its terms, could be completed within one
year, and otherwise does not fall within
the Statute of Frauds. A, Band Care
incorrect for the reasons stated in the
explanation to answer D.

50. C is the correct answer. The Jack-Dan
agreement calls for performance in
separate units making the contract di 
visible. Upon Dan's performance of
completing the pool and bleachers,
Jack's performance of paying $5,000
became due. By Jack repudiating the
contract, and failing to pay the second
installment, Dan may also sue for the
damages caused by Jack's repudiation
of the remainder of the contract. Dan
would be excused from any further ob 
ligation under the contract. A, Band D
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
the explanation to answer C.

51. B is the correct answer. The Parol Evi 
dence Rule provides that when parties
have placed their agreement into a writ 
ing, which they both agree and assent
to as their full and complete integrated
agreement, evidence of oral or written
terms will not be admitted to change or
vary the terms of the writing. However,
where the parties reduce their agree 
ment to a writing, without language that
the writing is fully integrated, parol
evidence is admissible to show there is
a condition precedent to the legal ef 
fectiveness of the writing. Since the
parties orally agreed that the sale would
occur only upon Bar candidate passing
his bar exam parol evidence of that con 
dition precedent is admissible. A, C and
D are incorrect for the stated reasons to
answer B.

lEI CONTRACTS

52. D is the correct answer. DeC §2-508
states that where any tender or delivery
by the seller is rejected because of
non-conformance, and the time for per 
formance has expired, the buyer may
properly reject the non-conforming ten 
der. Here, Buyer properly rejected
Seller's tender of the milk, that was
short 1,000 cartons, because the time
for Seller's performance had expired.
A is incorrect because the contract is
not objectively impossible to perform.
Band e are incorrect statements for the
reasons stated in the explanation to an 
swerD.

53. D is the correct answer. A liquidated
damages clause will be upheld where
the stipulated sum bears a reasonable
relation to the actual loss, actual dam 
ages are uncertain or difficult to ascer 
tain, and the contract, as a whole ,evi 
dences a conscious intention of the par 
ties to consider and adjust the damages
that might flow from the breach. None
of these factors are present, particularly
since Americo was able to resell the
equipment before seeking liquidated
damages, and thus was able to ascer 
tain its actual damages. A, Band Care
incorrect for the reasons stated above.

54. A is the correct answer. A shipment con 
tract was formed, since the contract re 
quired Manufacturer to deliver the
chairs. Once Manufacturer placed the
chairs upon the carrier, the risk of loss
passed to Baker because the contract
provided EO.B. at seller's place of busi 
ness. Since the risk ofloss was on Baker
and Manufacturer placed the chairs
upon the carrier, he is entitled to the
contract price despite the language in
the contract, Manufacture could assign
its right to collect from Baker. B is in 
correct, as stated in correct answer A.
e and D are an incorrect statements of
law per DeC §2-204.

55. e is the correct answer. The risk ofloss
passed, once Manufacturer placed the
chairs upon the carrier to Baker. Since
Baker has the risk, he is unable to re 
cover against Manufacturer. A, Band
D are incorrect for the reasons stated in
C.

56. e is the correct answer. Billy Joe will
not be limited to receive only damages;
he can rescind the contract because
Jermey misrepresented a fact that re 
lates to an essential part of the bargain.
A, Band D are incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in correct answer C.

CONTRACTS 1m

60. A is the correct answer. Tom accepted
SecureCo's offer at the price of $5,000,
creating a contract for that amount.
SecureCo bore the risk that his supplier
would not be able to provide compo 
nents at the price bid by the supplier.
B, C and D are incorrect for the reason
stated above.

61. D is the correct answer. Based on the
doctrine of promissory estoppel, when
a contractor detrimentally relies on the
bid of a subcontractor in making its own
bid on a project, the subcontractor is es 
topped from denying that an option con 
tract was created, to the extent neces 
sary to avoid injustice, when the con 
tractor was induced to rely on the
subcontractor's bid. When BurgCo
(subcontractor) failed to perform,
SecureCo (contractor) may enforce its
right to obtain the amount of its loss,
based on the reliance when BurgCo
would not fulfill its obligation. A, Band
C are incorrect for this reason.

62. A is the correct answer. There must be
a meeting of the minds (mutual assent)
between the parties in order to have a
binding contract. Since there was no
meeting of the minds in this example,
there was no contract. B, C and Dare
incorrect for this reason.

57. A is the correct answer. In order for a
third party beneficiary to recover for a
promisor's breach of contract, she must
be either a donee or creditor beneficiary.
Wendy's guarantee of the loan merely
made her an incidental beneficiary of
BCl's promise to obtain the higher pos 
sible price for the sale of Bombay's as 
sets. B, C and D are incorrect for the
reasons stated in the explanation to an 
swer A.

58. C is the best answer. UCC §2-601 re 
quires perfect tender such that if the
goods or tender of delivery are noncon 
forming in any respect, the buyer may
reject the whole delivery, accept the
whole, or accept part of the delivery and
reject the rest. Since the shutters were
nonconforming, the shipment was prop 
erly refused. A is incorrect because Lion
had the right to reject. B is incorrect
because Lion has the right to reject non 
conforming goods, despite Prevention's
acceptance. D is incorrect because Lion
still could reject non-conforming goods
even if sent as an accommodation.

59. B is the correct answer. Under UCC
§2-508, a seller may seasonably notify
the buyer of an intention to cure and
may make a conforming delivery within
the contract time if a non-conforming
tender or delivery is rejected. A, C and
D are incorrect because of the reasons
stated in the explanation to answer B.

11m CONTRACTS

66. B is the correct answer. Where a party
expressed a future inability to perform,
he has not repudiated the contract. An 
ticipatory repudiation occurs where one
party to an executory bilateral contract
repudiates the contract in advance of the
time set for performance, by stating
unequivocally that he will not perform
the contract. Thus, Leon did not breach
the contract by repudiation when he
stated he did not think he could perform
the remodeling work. A, e and Dare
incorrect for the above reasons.

67. A is the correct answer. Tromp is en 
titled to the damages he suffered as a
result of the loss of his bargain with
Leon. Loss of bargain damages are
measured by the difference between
contract price and market value of the
breached performance, at the time and
place the contract was to be performed.
Since Tromp contracted to pay an ad 
ditional $200,000 to Ivan to complete
the work, this is the difference between
the contract price and market value, i.e
is the amount recoverable by Tromp. B,
e and D are incorrect for the above rea 
sons.

63. A is the correct answer. The uee
§2-205 "firm offer" rule provides that
where a merchant makes a signed, writ 
ten offer to buy or sell goods that gives
assurances that it will be held open, such
is irrevocable, absent consideration,
during the stated period or, if no time is
stated, for a reasonable time (not to ex 
ceed three months). B, e and D are in 
correct under the above rule.

64. D is the correct answer. uee §2-207
provides that, between merchants, ad 
ditional terms become part of the con 
tract, unless they materially alter it.
Requesting delivery of 150 pounds of
fresh olives that could spoil, in Novem 
ber instead of October, materially al 
tered the terms of the contract. Thus,
the court will give effect to the original
terms of the offer. A, Band e are incor 
rect for the reasons stated in the expla 
nation to answer D.

65. B is the correct answer. Under uee §2 
607(3), a buyer who accepts tender of
goods from a seller, must notify the
seller of any breach within a reasonable
time after he discovers or should have
discovered the breach, or he is barred
from any remedy. Since Mario accepted
the non-conforming olives, he must
notify Oliva eo. oftheir non-merchant 
able quality, in order to have any rem 
edy against the seller. A, e and Dare
incorrect for the above reasons.

CONTRACTS lED

71. D is the correct answer. Answer I is in 
correct because Buyer was not answer 
ing for Seller's debt. Instead, the
Buyer-Seller agreement made Creditor
an intended third party beneficiary of
the agreement. Such need not be in writ 
ing to be enforceable. Answer II is in 
correct because, even though a contract
for the sale of an interest in land must
be in writing to be enforceable, parol
evidence is admissible to correct a mis 
take in the contract. A, Band C are in 
correct for the reasons stated in the cor 
rect answer D.

72. C is the correct answer. The parol evi 
dence rule provides when a written con 
tract is entered into between parties
where the writing is intended to be the
full and complete integration of their
agreement, evidence of prior or written
terms will not be permitted for the pur 
pose of changing or altering the writ 
ten terms. However, there are excep 
tions to the rule: fraud, duress, mistake,
illegality and lack of consideration.
Here, the secretary mistakenly put in the
term $134,000 instead of $135,000.
Thus, parol evidence could be intro 
duced to show the actual price for Par 
cel because of the mistake. A, Band D
are incorrect for the above reasons
stated in C.

68. C is the correct answer. Green and
Brown made a contract that was ex 
pressed in a writing, to which they both
assented to be a complete and accurate
integration. Parol evidence does not al 
low any terms made prior to or contem 
poraneously with, to vary or contradict
the terms of the writing. A is incorrect
for the reasons stated in C. B is an in 
correct statement of law. D is irrelevant
to the facts as stated.

69. D is the correct answer. Where there is
a mutual mistake, such as here, is no
defense to a breach of contract that the
mistake was one ofjudgment. Here both
parties erroneously thought there would
not be any change during the term of
the lease. Therefore Dick is liable to
Willy for his failure to pay his rent de 
spite the decline in business. A is in 
correct, because it is not objectively
impossible to pay the rent. B is an in 
correct statement of law. C is incorrect,
because D is the more precise answer.

70. D is the correct answer. Since Dawn
failed to perform first, if the court finds
that her failure was not a material
breach, Tony's duties would not be ex 
cused. A is incorrect because the con 
tract called for performance as a whole.
B is incorrect because her performance
is not objectively impossible. C is in 
correct because D is more precise.

lEI CONTRACTS

73. B is the correct answer. A contract is
not enforceable, unless it is supported
by consideration. Since the facts do not
indicate that Lisa gave any consider 
ation, no contract based upon the above
facts was formed. A and D are incor 
rect because B is the more precise an 
swer. C is incorrect because this would
not be the best defense. Rather, this
would hinder Allen's claim that the con 
tract is unenforceable.

74. C is the correct answer. Statement I is
correct because Allen told the doctor he
would pay his fees before Doctor
treated Lisa for her injuries resulting in
Doctor's reliance (i.e., this is a valid
substitute for consideration). Further,
statement II is correct because if Allen
had a contract with Lisa, Doctor would
be a third party beneficiary to the
Allen-Lisa contract. Upon Allen telling
Doctor he would pay, Doctor's rights
vested. A, Band D are incorrect for the
same reasons that C is correct.

75. A is the correct answer. Since Doctor
performed his services to Lisa for her
injuries, she received a benefit. To al 
low her to not pay would be contrary to
public policy. B is incorrect because it
is irrelevant. C and D are incorrect for
the reasons that A is correct.

76. B is the best answer. The Statute of
Frauds requires contracts be in writing:
(1) for the transfer of an interest in land
or, (2) which cannot be completed
within one year of the date of contract 
ing. While Terry will argue that her pay 
ments and improvements are part per 
formance of the contract, thereby tak 
ing it out of the Statute of Frauds, her
actions are also consistent with her prior
relationship with Oliver, as a month 
to-month tenant. A and D are incorrect
for this reason. C is an incorrect state 
ment of law.

77. B is the correct answer. The Statute of
Frauds requires a contract for the sale
of land to be in writing. However, par 
tial payments by Terry takes the oral
agreement outside the statute. A is in 
correct because it does not fall within
an exception to the Statute of Frauds.
C and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in correct answer B.

78. B is the correct answer. Where parties
enter into a transaction under a mistake
regarding a fact assumed by each party
which is the basis of the bargain for
which they enter into the contact, it is
voidable by either party, if enforcement
would materially alter that which was
bargained for. Here, Denny bargained
for a 1916 "D" dime that turned out to
be counterfeit. Thus, the contract can be
rescinded. A, C and D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in correct answer B.

CONTRACTS lEI

82. Ais the correct answer. Kemper's omis 
sion of the $301,769 price from the
company's bid was a material, unilat 
eral mistake. A unilateral mistake is
grounds for rescission. B is incorrect
because it is an incorrect statement of
law. e is incorrect because it assumes
facts not given in the question. D is in 
correct because a submitted bid can be
withdrawn- prior to its acceptance, as
here.

83. e is the correct answer. Under the uee,
when the contract requires buyer's pay 
ment before he receives the goods, such
payment is not an acceptance of the
goods. Therefore, Bob has retained his
right to inspect the wool despite his pay 
ment for the goods. A, Band D are in 
correct for this reason.

84. e is the correct answer because it is a
correct statement of the amount of dam 
ages recoverable to a buyer when the
seller has tendered nonconforming
goods. Bob will seek damages in the
amount of the price paid, plus an
amount for reimbursement of the price
to purchase substitute (No.1 quality)
goods. A, Band D are incorrect for the
same reasons that e is correct.

79. A is the correct answer. A contract en 
tered into by a minor, except for neces 
sities, are voidable at the election of the
minor, and may be disaffirmed by the
minor during minority or within a rea 
sonable time after reaching majority.
The continuing payments and use of the
car by Rodgers after reaching the age
of majority constituted affirmation of
the contract. B is incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in correct answer A. e is
incorrect because not all contracts en 
tered into by minors are voidable (e.g.,
necessities). D is incorrect because,
under the majority rule, a minor does
not have to return the merchandise to
have a valid disaffirmance.

80. D is the correct answer. A contract en 
tered into by a minor is voidable and
can be disaffirmed up until majority, or
a reasonable time thereafter. A is incor 
rect because the majority rule does not
require the minor to return the merchan 
dise. Band e are incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in correct answer D.

81. e is correct because a seller has a duty
to disclose any information involving
latent dangerous conditions on the prop 
erty. Mr. Tibbs had knowledge of the
contaminated well, and failed to dis 
close. This amounted to a fraudulent
misrepresentation. A and B are incor 
rect because it incorrectly states the law.
D is incorrect because fraudulent mis 
representation is a basis to rescind a
contract.

lEI CONTRACTS

85. B is the correct answer. Under the uee,
if a seller does not give the buyer in 
structions on how to dispose of non 
conforming goods, a buyer may resell
the goods, store the goods, or reship the
goods back to seller. If the buyer intends
to resell the goods at a private sale, he
must give the seller reasonable notice
of his intention to do so. A, e and Dare
incorrect for the reasons stated above.

86. A is the correct answer. Melissa's offer
was for a unilateral contract, which can
only be accepted by the doing of the
act requested in the offer and not by a
return promise. B is incorrect because
a unilateral contract would only be
formed when Nancy performed the re 
quired act of coming to the office be 
fore or after work, not by mailing an
acceptance. e is incorrect because it is
an untrue statement of fact. D is incor 
rect because Melissa's offer was for a
unilateral contract.

87. e is the correct answer. Under u.c.c.
§2-205, a firm offer applies only to an
offer made by a merchant. A, Band D
are incorrect because the common law
rule is that a promise of irrevocability
must be supported by consideration.

88. B is the correct answer. Marty had an
option for 60 days. His counter-offer of
April 5, 1993, did not terminate that
option. A is incorrect because it is not
the best answer. Although a contract
was formed, it was breached because
of Tim selling Midnight to an innocent
third party. e is incorrect because
Marty's counter-offer does not termi 
nate his option. D is incorrect because
it is an incorrect statement of law.

89. D is the correct answer. Although the
counter-offer, in an option contract,
does not terminate the power to accept
the offer, if the optionor (Tim) detrimen 
tally relies upon the rejection, the power
to accept terminates at the time of reli 
ance. Here, the time of reliance would
have been when Tim sold the mare. A
is incorrect because of the reasoning
stated in correct answer D. B is not the
best answer, although Marty was aware
of the sale of Midnight on this date. e
is incorrect because the option to ac 
cept was for 60 days. The counter-offer
would not terminate the option contract.

CONTRACTS 11m

93. B is the correct answer. For Con to win,
it must be shown that he neither had
actual nor constructive knowledge of
the miscalculation. A is incorrect be 
cause John would not be bound by the
contract if Con knew of the miscalcu 
lation. C is an incorrect statement of
law. D is incorrect because there was
an anticipatory breach of contract.

94. A is the correct answer. John was un 
der a pre-existing duty to do the work
for $80,000. There is no consideration
to support Con promising to pay the
additional $4,000. B is incorrect be 
cause whether or not Con intended to
pay the additional amount is irrelevant.
C is incorrect because of the pre-exist 
ing duty. D is an incorrect statement of
fact.

95. C is the correct answer. Sterling had
essentially complied with the provision,
and only had the records at the store for
inventory purposes. Thus, he reason 
ably satisfied the insurance provision.
A is incorrect because Sterling had at 
tempted to fulfill his performance un 
der the contract. B is incorrect because
the facts do not indicate that the provi 
sion was an express condition. D is an
incorrect statement of law.

90. C is the correct answer. Under U.e.e.
§2- 207, proposed new terms in a con 
tract between merchants do not termi 
nate the offer and become part of that
contract, unless: (1) the offer is limited
to its own terms; (2) the terms materi 
ally alter the contract; and (3) the off 
eror objects within a reasonable time.
These three conditions were not met. A
and B are incorrect because Tim and
Marty are both merchants; thus, u.e.e.
§2-207 would apply. D, although a cor 
rect answer, is not the best answer be 
cause D, without justification, assumes
that Tim objects to the terms.

91. B is the correct answer. A bilateral con 
tract consists of a promise in exchange
for a promise. Here, Morrocam Com 
pany agreed to give Matt lifetime em 
ployment in exchange for a reduced
wage. A, although a correct statement
of law, is not the best answer. C and D
are incorrect, because they misstate the
common law.

92. B is the correct answer. All of the nec 
essary terms needed to satisfy the re 
quirement of a sufficient memorandum,
under the u.e.e., are contained in Gil's
note. A is incorrect because, without the
memo, Gil is only liable for the glasses
he has accepted. C is incorrect because
a repudiation by one party, does not ter 
minate a valid contract. D is incorrect
because the note does satisfy the Stat 
ute of Frauds.

1m CONTRACTS

96. D is the correct answer. When the of 
feree dispatches an acceptance and
changes his mind and dispatches a re 
pudiation, when such repudiation
reaches the offeror first, there is, nev 
ertheless, a valid contract - unless the
offeror relies to his detriment on the
rejection. A is incorrect because of the
reasoning in correct answer D. B is an
incorrect statement of law. e is incor 
rect because the telephone is a reason 
able method of communication, under
these circumstances.

97. A is the correct answer. The parties to a
valid bilateral contract, which is partly
unperformed on each side, may agree
to a discharge of all remaining duties.
The consideration is provided by each
party's discharge of the other's duties.
B is incorrect because there was mu 
tual assent when Jim accepted Rod's
offer. e and D are incorrect for the same
reason that A is correct.

98. D is the correct answer. Only if Home 
owner had known that Renoir's bid was
made through error, could he not re 
cover. A is legally irrelevant. Band e
are incorrect statements of law.

99. B is the correct answer. Renoir was
under a pre-existing duty to paint
Homeowner's home for $5,500. Fur 
ther, Homeowner's promise to pay an
additional $600 was not supported by
consideration. A is incorrect because
there is no reason that the promise to
pay additional money be in writing. e
is incorrect because the detrimental
reliance does not cure the lack of con 
sideration. D is incorrect because it is
an untrue statement of law.

100. e is the correct answer. Traditionally,
the pre-existing duty rule, and the
promise for increased performance,
could not be enforced, due to lack of
consideration. Modernly, courts permit
the modification, where it is fair and
equitable. A is incorrect for the reasons
stated in correct answer e. B is incor 
rect because the promise did not need
to be in writing. D is incorrect because
"detrimental reliance" is used where a
substitute for consideration is required.
Here, there was a valid modification
supported by consideration.

10 1. A is the best answer. The U.e.e. would
not apply to this contract, since it in 
volves services. B is incorrect, because
it is irrelevant. e is an incorrect appli 
cation of law to fact. D is incorrect.
Although v.c.e. §2-609 permits a
party to a sales contract to demand "as 
surance of performance," the V.e.e.
would not apply to this fact pattern.

CONTRACTS lEI

105. D is the correct answer. Where the in 
ducement of a party's promise is a past
event or benefit, the past consideration
is not sufficient to render the party's
promise enforceable. A is incorrect
because the consideration was past
consideration. B is an incorrect state 
ment of fact. C is an incorrect state 
ment, as applied to these facts.

106. B is the correct answer. An assignee
takes a contract subject to defenses
against his assignor. If Roofer has not
properly performed, this defense could
be used by Pet Shop. A is incorrect be 
cause it is irrelevant whether or not Mr.
Nail is capable of applying a roof. C is
incorrect because an agreement not to
assign destroys the right, but not the
power to assign, e.g. the right to re 
ceive payment. D is incorrect, because
Mr. Nail is not claiming to be a third
party beneficiary, but rather is claim 
ing to be an assignee.

107. A is the correct answer. Wife had no
vested rights under the policy, since
any rights were expressly subject to
Isac's power to change beneficiaries.
B is an incorrect application of the
facts to the law. C is an incorrect state 
ment of law. D is incorrect because,
although at one time she was a donee
beneficiary, Isac used his power to
change beneficiaries and made his
daughter the sole beneficiary.

102. B is the best answer. In a bilateral con 
tract, each party's promise supplies
consideration. Thus, if one party's
promise does not subject him to a le 
gal detriment, it does not supply the
requisite consideration, and the other
party's promise is not enforceable. A
is incorrect because an illusory prom 
ise generally arises where one party
makes a promise in exchange for a
promise that does not limit the other's
future options. Here, Betty made no
promise in exchange for Harley's
promise so no issue of illusory prom 
ise arises. C is incorrect because the
Statute of Frauds is not applicable to
this fact pattern. D is a correct state 
ment of fact but B is the better answer.

103. C is the correct answer. Statement I is
correct because Harley's promise in
advance of the doctor's performance
would give rise to detrimental reliance.
Statement II is correct because the
Harley-Betty contract could make the
doctor an intended third party benefi 
ciary

104. D is the correct answer. There is a
bargaine-for-exchange under these
facts. Harley will pay, if Creditor will
not file a claim. A is incorrect because
one can bring a claim against the es 
tate of a deceased person. B is incor 
rect because there was consideration.
C is incorrect because promissory es 
toppel is not applicable to these facts.

11m CONTRACTS

108. D is the correct answer. Isac named his
daughter as a donee beneficiary. A is
an incorrect statement of law. B is in 
correct because borrowing against the
policy would not extinguish the
daughter's rights as a donee benefi 
ciary. C is incorrect because public
policy, as presently interpreted, does
not so mandate.

109. C is the correct answer. The assign 
ment would be viewed as an exercise
of the power inherent in the contract.
A and B are incorrect statements of
law. D is incorrect since, even if the
assignment were gratuitous, the out 
come would be the same.

110. D is the correct answer. The general
rule is that the assignee is subject to
the same defenses that the obligor has
against the assignee. If Eva had not
performed properly, Elva would have
a defense against her, and could use
this defense against Flora. Although
the facts do not stipulate this derelic 
tion in performance, the answer does.
As a general strategy with multistate
questions, it is better that all of the facts
appear in the fact pattern. Neverthe 
less, when the three remaining options
are clearly incorrect, as here, this kind
of answer is correct. A is incorrect be 
cause Flora is an assignee, not a ben 
eficiary. B is incorrect because it is le 
gally immaterial to these facts. C is a
correct statement of law; however, fur 
nishing the flowers would not be
deemed to be a personal service, and
thus the special services rule would not
be applicable. That is, C is an irrelevant
statement of law.

111. D is the correct answer. A new prom 
ise to perform an obligation which is
voidable, will be enforced so long as
the new promise is not voidable for the
same reasons. The new promise is
called a ratification. A and B are in 
correct for the same reasons that D is
correct. C is incorrect because the writ 
ing itself is not at issue based upon
these facts.

CONTRACTS am

112. D is the correct answer. The u.e.e.
Statute of Frauds requires that the sale
of goods priced at $500 or more to be
in writing to be enforceable. Although
the original agreement was oral, a writ 
ten confirmation between merchants
may be binding on the party to be
charged, without signing, ifthe receiv 
ing party fails to object within 10 days
of receipt. While, the first written con 
firmation was not received, Cat will
assert that the protest letter, a second
confirmation, identifies the existence
of a contract, and therefore is suffi 
cient. A and B are incorrect for the rea 
soning stated in correct answer D. C,
although a correct answer, is not the
best answer, under the prevailing in 
terpretations given to the u.e.e.

113. A is the correct answer. When a check
marked "payment in full" is cashed for
a disputed debt, the courts generally
regard it as evidencing an accord and
satisfaction with the debtor. Therefore,
no further rights to additional payment
exist. Answers B, C and D are non 
sensical and irrelevant, when applied
to these specific facts.

114. C is the correct answer. An implied
novation occurs where: there has been
(1) an effective delegation; (2) the ob 
ligor repudiates liability to obligee
(Jag); and (3) the obligee accepts per 
formance of the delegatee (Cathy),
without reserving rights against the ob 
ligor. All of the above elements have
been satisfied, under the given facts.
A is an incorrect application of law. B
is incorrect because it is not a good ar 
gument for Tim, but a good argument
for Jag. D is incorrect for the same rea 
sons that C is correct.

115. B is the correct answer because only
Choices I and II are correct. Cat Im 
ports will be entitled to "cover" dam 
ages. Thus, it can purchase substitute
automobiles from another dealer, and
recover the difference in price from
Jag. Therefore, Choice I is correct. Cat
may also request specific performance,
Choice II. The u.e.e. provides that a
buyer may receive specific perfor 
mance, where the goods are unique (or
in other proper circumstances). If Cat
Imports is unable to locate the cars, Jag
may be required to deliver. Choice III
is incorrect because reformation is
clearly not an appropriate remedy
when a court has found that a valid
contract exists - as here stipulated. A,
C, and D are incorrect for the same
reasons that B is correct.

am CONTRACTS

116. B is the correct answer. There was an
agreement between Playgoer and Dr.
Othello based on the offer to pay later
for help from Doctor. A is an irrelevant
statement of law, because there was no
need to look for an implied contract
based on the rationale for answer B. C
and D are incorrect statements of law.

117. A is the correct answer because it pre-
sumes Matt was not incapacitated by
his drinking. A reasonable person
would have found Matt's statement to
be an offer, whether or not he made it
in jest. Therefore, the court will find a
valid contract, and Eileen can most
likely sue for specific performance. B
is incorrect because the court will en-
force the contract- most likely through
specific performance and A is the bet-
ter answer. C is incorrect because be-
ing drunk will not automatically act as
a defense. D is incorrect because
whether or not Matt's statement was
made in jest, a reasonable person
would find his statement to be an of-
fer and such is the correct legal stan-
dard.

118. A is the correct answer. The buyer's
remedy for non-conforming goods is:
damages measured by the contract
price differential, or by cover price. B
is incorrect, since it misstates the law,
regarding the measure of damage. C
is incorrect, since it is a misstatement
of law. D is incorrect because specific
performance would only be applicable
where the goods were unique or where
damages would be inadequate.

Il9. C is the correct answer. V.C.C.
§§2-711(3) and 2-706(2), (3), state that
when a buyer has paid for goods,
which are nonconforming and buyer
demands repayment, seller may resell
the goods either at a private or public
sale. However, if it is a private sale,
reasonable advance notice must be
given to the original buyer. A and B
are incorrect since they are incomplete
answers. D is an incorrect statement
of the law of the u.e.e.

120. D is the correct answer. Vnder V.e.e.
§2-512(2), pre-inspection payment
does not act as a waiver of inspection
or remedies. Answers A, Band Care
incorrect statements of law.

121. B is the correct answer. The personal
services appear to be routine, rather
than unique - thus, the duty will be
found delegable. A is incorrect since it
is unsupported by any facts. C and D
are incorrect applications of the given
facts to the law.

122. A is the best answer. Although a del-
egatee may be also be liable to the ob-
ligor/delegator, he is personally liable
for the performance to the obligee
(here, Candace), who is a creditor
beneficary of Tumi's promise. An-
swers Band C are therefore incorrect,
because they are incomplete. D is a
misstatement of the law.

CONTRACTS III

123. B is the correct answer. The offer was
a manifestation of an intent to be
bound. It was very specific. It de 
scribed the subject matter (skis) the
amount ($250), and was directed to a
specific group, (first come first serve.)
A is incorrect, since it is an offer - not
merely an invitation to deal. C is an
incorrect statement of law. D is incor 
rect, for the same reasons that B is cor 
rect.

124. D is the correct answer. The contract
stipulated EO.B., Seller's place of
business. Thus, the risk of loss passed
to Buyer. Seller would be entitled to
the contract price. Therefore, Son, as
the assignee, would be entitled to the
contract price. A is incorrect, because
the contract stated EO.B. Seller's place
of business. B is incorrect because
most contractual provisions, stating
that rights may not be assigned, is in 
effective. C is incorrect, since it mis 
states the law which is appropriate to
this fact pattern.

125. Ais the correct answer. The risk ofloss
had shifted to Buyer. B is incorrect,
because Seller had already delivered
the boats to the carrier. C and Dare
incorrect statements of law.

126. B is the correct answer. The typo was
a unilateral mistake. Further, Maestro
would have known of the mistake,
since he is an accomplished musician
and would know that a Stradivarius is
worth over a million dollars. A is in 
correct since it is not the best answer.
Specific performance is equitable in
certain situations; however, it is not in
this situation. C and D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in correct answer B.

127. A is the correct answer. A valid con 
tract was not formed because Sub gave
Builder a counter-offer rather than an
acceptance. B is incorrect because ac 
ceptance must be made by a reply, not
conduct. C is incorrect because if the
writing had been an acceptance, the
mailbox rule would apply. D is incor 
rect because at that stipulated time, Sub
no longer had the power to accept the
original offer.

128. D is the best defense. The Statute of
Frauds is applicable since the agree 
ment, by its terms, could not be per 
formed within one year of the making
thereof. Ais incorrect since Uncle Jed's
death is irrelevant to any agreement
between Elly Mae and Jethro. B is
likely factually incorrect and is also in 
correct because D is a better answer.
C is factually incorrect because argu 
ably some manifestation of intent
could be found between the parties.

11:1 CONTRACTS

129. D is the correct answer. Elly Mae's aca-
demic hard work would constitute
valid consideration. A is incorrect be-
cause there is consideration, as dis-
cussed in correct answer D. B is an
incorrect application of law. C is in-
correct because promissory estoppel is
a more appropriate argument when
there is a lack of consideration.

130. B is the correct answer. Pete is entitled
to sue on the basis of his bilateral con-
tract with Heather. A, although a cor-
rect statement, is not the best answer
because it fails to give legally appro-
priate reasons. C is incorrect because
it is irrelevant. There was a bargained-
for-exchange; and there are no issues
of fraud, etc. relevant here. D is an ir-
relevant statement of law, under the
given facts. There was an enforceable
contract

131. A is the correct answer. The offer was
an offer for an act (a unilateral con-
tract). Band C are incorrect because
the notice constituted contractual in-
tent. D is incorrect because the faculty
was, in fact, bargaining- by trying to
encourage moot court participation.

132. C is the correct answer. Laura in-
creased her efforts in reliance of P.D. 's
offer. Her intensified efforts would
constitute sufficient part performance.
A is incorrect because of the reason-
ing in correct answer C. Band Dare
incorrect and legally irrelevant state-
ments.

133. C is the correct answer. The offer con-
stituted a unilateral contract, since only
the act of winning the competition
would constitute the acceptance. A, B
and D are incorrect because of the rea-
soning in correct answer C.

134. A is the correct answer. P.D. 's prom-
ise was conditioned on the occurrence
of Laura winning. Band Care mis-
statements of law. D is incorrect for
the same reasons that A is correct.

135. D is the correct answer. Laura's death
would not terminate the offer because
she has already performed (turned in
the winning brief). A and Bare incor-
rect legal statements. C is incorrect be-
cause it misses the mark - there is no
reason to rely on promissory estoppel
principles.

136. B is the correct answer. Chopin's state-
ment that he might not be ready to start,
would not constitute an "unequivocal"
repudiation. A is incorrect because a
repudiation does not have to be in writ-
ing. C is incorrect because there was
not a definite repudiation. D is an in-
correct statement of law, as applied to
these facts.

CONTRACTS III

140. D is the correct answer. Under mod-
em law, a contract can be rescinded
orally. A is incorrect for the reasons
stated in correct answer D. B is an ir-
relevant factual statement, based on the
above law. C is incorrect because it is
legally irrelevant.

141. A is the correct answer. Although Cal
is in material breach, he may recover
in quasi-contract. B is an incorrect ap-
plication of the doctrine of impossibil-
ity. This doctrine requires there be
more than a mere shortage of funds. C
is incorrect because it is Cal who is in
material breach. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that A is the correct an-
swer.

142. C is the correct answer. Although Cal
is in material breach, he may recover
in quasi-contract. His recovery will be
based on restitution. A and B are in-
correct because of the analysis stated
in correct answer C. D is incorrect be-
cause Cal's breach was not willful.

143. B is the correct answer. Public policy
finds adhesion contracts unenforce-
able, since they represent gross in-
equality of bargaining position. A, al-
though a correct statement of fact, is
not a legal reason for recovery. C and
D are incorrect for the same reason that
B is correct.

137. B is the correct answer. An aggrieved
party is relieved of his obligation, only
where a material breach occurs. A 10-
day delay would likely not constitute
a material breach. A is incorrect be-
cause notification, under these facts,
does not constitute an anticipatory re-
pudiation. C is incorrect because such
is not a justifiable legal reason, stand-
ing alone, by which a contract is per-
mitted to be canceled. D is incorrect
because it is most likely that there was
no material breach, under their contract
and these facts.

138. B is the correct answer. Bugsy is en-
titled to be placed in the position he
would have been in, had Chopin fol-
lowed through with the contract. A is
incorrect because it does not account
for the other 11 months. C is incorrect
for the reasons stated in correct answer
B. D is incorrect because the damages
are $1,000 a month, not $4,000.

139. B is the correct answer because only
Choice II is correct. The Statute of
Frauds requires contract for the sale of
goods for $500 or more to be in writ-
ing. Choice I is incorrect because the
Statute of Frauds does not apply to a
contract for services, unless perfor-
mance cannot be completed within one
year of the making thereof. That is not
the situation here. A, C and Dare in-
correct because they either do not con-
tain correct Choice II, or contain in-
correct Choice I.

III CONTRACTS

144. A is the correct answer. Under u.e.e.
§2-206(l)(b), an offer to buy goods for
prompt shipment can be acceptable by
notice or by actual shipment. B is an
inapplicable statement oflaw. C is fac 
tually incorrect because the shipment
had already occurred before revoca 
tion. D is incorrect because it is legally
irrelevant.

145. D is the correct answer. Under U.e.e.
§2-206(1)(b), shipment is a legal ac 
ceptance, even if the goods shipped are
non-conforming. However, the ship 
ment of non-conforming goods is a
breach of contract. Thus, Buyer can re 
ject the goods. Answers A and B are
incorrect for the reasoning stated in
correct answer D. C is incorrect be 
cause Manufacturer did not state that
the non-conforming goods were only
accommodations.

146. C is the correct answer because Uni 
form Commercial Code (UCC) section
9-313 allows Earl's to prevail over any
person becoming a lien creditor, after
the security interest became perfected
by Earl's timely filing of the security
interest in the air conditioning system.
A is an incorrect statement of law. B is
incorrect because a secured interest is
not automatically perfected, absent a
filing. D is incorrect because, upon a
proper filing of a secured interest in
fixtures, that party is protected from
other creditors claiming an interest in
the fixture.

147. D is the correct answer. The FOB term
is a delivery term - even if only used
in conjunction with the price; thus, re 
quiring delivery from the seller to the
buyer's carrier to shift the risk of loss.
The risk of loss did not pass because
the container was merely loaded, not
delivered, at the time it was stolen. A
is incorrect because Sam did not de 
liver the goods by merely loading
Bob's shipping container. B is incor 
rect because there are not facts to sup 
port this contention. C is an incorrect
statement of law.

148. B is the best answer. UCC section
9-313(2) provides that no security in 
terest exists in ordinary building ma 
terials incorporated into an improve 
ment on land. Once John used the lum 
ber to construct the garage, Hardware
was prevented from having a security
interest in the goods. A is incorrect
because it is not as concise as B. Cis
incorrect because of the reasons stated
for answer B. D is an incorrect state 
ment of law, as it applies to ordinary
building materials such as lumber, dry 
wall or window glass.

CONTRACTS III

149. A is the correct answer. VCC section
9-313(4)(b) provides that, between a
fixture financier ("FRV") and a sub 
sequent real estate interest ("Continen 
tal"), the first secured party to file or
record prevails. Because FRV filed its
interest before Continental, FRV pre 
vails. B is incorrect because it is an in 
correct statement of the law. C is an
incorrect statement of the law as ap 
plied to a subsequent realty interest. D
is incorrect because Article 9 permits
fixture financiers to have a secured in 
terest in chattels affixed to realty.

150. D is the correct answer. VCC section
9-313(4)(a) permits a fixture financier
to defeat a pre-existing realty interest
when: (1) the fixture security interest
is a purchase money security interest,
(2) the fixture security interest is per 
fected by a fixture filing, (3) the filing
is made before the goods become fix 
tures or within twenty days thereafter,
and (4) the debtor has a recorded in 
terest or possession of the realty. Since
element 3 is missing, FRV's priority
claim against Intrastate is defeated. A
is incorrect because the grace period
is only 20 days. Band C are incorrect
because of the rule stated in the expla 
nation to answer D.

151. C is the best answer. VCC section
9-401(2) provides that an improper fil 
ing which is made in good faith is ef 
fective: (1) to the extent of the collat 
eral for which the filing was proper and
(2) against any person who actually
knows the contents of the financing
statement. Since part of George's de 
scription was proper, the filing is ef 
fective as to the properly-described
collateral. A, Band D each are incor 
rect statements of law.

152. C is the best answer. Although a se 
cured party may remove his collateral
upon default without resort to the ju 
dicial process, unless otherwise
agreed, he must do so without a breach
of the peace. Bob's smashing of the
cafe window was a breach of the peace
which is not permitted under Article
9. A, Band D are incorrect for the same
reasons that C is correct.

153. D is the correct answer. A secured
creditor of fixtures may remove his
collateral upon default, but he must re 
imburse any party, except the debtor,
for the cost of repair for the physical
damage caused by the fixture removal.
A, Band C are incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in the explanation to an 
swer D.

am CONTRACTS

154. A is the best answer. The implied war 
ranty of merchantability must be dis 
claimed by use ofthe term "merchant 
ability." The language in Tina's con 
tract made no mention of disclaiming
the implied warranty of merchantabil 
ity. Band e are incorrect because they
neglect to consider the attempted dis 
claimer of warranty. D is incorrect for
the reason stated in the explanation to
answer A.

155. D is the correct answer. Under uee
2-312, a seller of goods warrants that
she is conveying good title, that her
title is rightful, and that the goods will
be delivered free of security interest
or other liens. Paula did not have good
title at the time she sold the stereo to
Tracee, so she breached the warranty
of title to Tracee. A, Band e are in 
correct for the reasons stated in the
explanation to answer D.

QUESTIONS   

1. The state of Columbia has made it a
crime to "be addicted to any illegal sub-
stance." The crime is a felony. The
crime is violative of due process be-
cause:  

A. It is a "status" crime which has

insufficient actus reus.

B. Involuntary intoxication should

be a defense.

C. It is void for vagueness.

D. It is fundamentally unfair.

2. Josey was convicted of false pretenses.
The judge instructed the jury as follows:
"The burden of proof is on the prosecu-
tion, to prove each and every element
of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
Here, the prosecution must prove that
the defendant obtained title to property
of another by means of misstatement
of past or existing fact. If you find each
element proven by the facts, then the
defendant is guilty." The defendant was
convicted. His best ground of appeal,
based on the preceding, is:

A. The evidence was insufficient, as

a matter of law.

Q  

B. He has no grounds of appeal,
since the instruction was perfect. 

C. The mens rea element was left
out of "false pretenses," and
since this is a malum en se crime,
such omission violates due pro-
cess.

D. The instruction does not require
the obtaining of documentary
title.

Questions 3 - 7 are based on the
following fact situation:

Ready and Randy came over to visit Able
one fateful morning and did their utmost to
get Able to agree to join them in a burglary.
Able would not agree; however, Randy and

tain warehouse, broke in and stole the rare
painting they had told Able about. They then
drove home without incident, having had the
car for only two hours and, as prearranged,
left the keys in Able's mailbox. Randy, tuck 
ing the small painting under his left arm,
proceeded to walk with Ready to his apart

Q     

Questions 8 — 10 are based on the
following fact situation:   

One evening in December, Sam came to the
unoccupied summer home of a wealthy
banker who used it only during the months
of July and August. Sam found the back door
completely open. He walked in, looking for
something to eat. Sam had no money and
was dying of starvation. 

After finding something to eat, Sam noticed
a beautiful diamond ring on the dining room
table. He tried it on just to see how it would

Questions 11 -13 are based on the
following fact situation:

Frank, 6 years old, and Jesse, 16 years old,
decided it would be great fun to "scare the
pants off" Lionel Hart, the neighborhood
grouch. Their idea was to gain entry to Hart's
home and leap out at him as he was about to
enter upon returning home from work.

One evening about 9:00 p.m., Jesse drove
to Hart's house and, pushing open the al 
ready slightly-opened ground floor window,
they entered. While waiting for the moment
to arrive, Frank's eyes were attracted to a
small gold figurine standing on a bookcase.
Without Jesse's knowledge, Frank put it in
his pocket.

When Hart arrived home, the boys leaped
out at him. Startled by their actions, Hart
stepped backward, falling down the stairs.
The fall resulted in Hart's death.

11. Frank's best defense at common law to

a charge of burglary would be:

A. That there was no breaking, since
the window was already open.

B. There was no felonious intent at
the time of the breaking and en 
tering.

C. Since the boys were neighbor 
hood kids known to Mr. Hart,
they impliedly had consent to go
into the premises.

9. Which of the following is the best de 
fense to a charge of attempted larceny
of the ring:

A. He had not taken a substantial

step to commit larceny.

B. Larceny is a crime against pos 
session and nobody was in pos 
session of the ring at the time.

C. Since he never left the house with
the food, there was no "asporta 
tion" as defined by the common
law.

D. The ring was abandoned prop 

erty.

10. Which of the following would be the
best common law defense to the charge
of burglary:

A. Sam had diminished capacity.

B. Burglary is a crime against habi 
tation, and nobody lived in the
house at the time.

C. There was no "breaking."

D. Sam was under compulsion.

E CRIMINAL LAW

D. He was under seven years old,
and thus as an infant, he had a
complete defense.

12. Jesse's best defense at common law to
a charge of conspiracy to commit in-
voluntary manslaughter would be:

A. The crime of manslaughter
merges with the greater crime of
burglary.

14. Ace and Don commit a bank robbery.
Don goes to his mother's and tells her,
"I am in trouble with the law. Hide me."
Ace is arrested and implicates Don. The
police go to Don's mother's house
where they inquire if Don is there, as
he is wanted for investigation of a bank
robbery. Don's mother states that she
does not know where Don is, despite
the fact that Don, at the moment, is hid-
ing in the closet. Modernly, Don's
mother may be guilty:

B. There was no such crime at com-

mon law.

A. Of conspiracy.

C. Jesse was guilty of another crime

the accidental manner of Hart's
death.

D. As an accessory before the fact.

15. Dugan has suffered from chronic alco-
holism for twenty years. One night
while sober, Dugan shot and killed a
man he claimed had been sent by the
devil. At Dugan's trial for murder, a
psychiatrist testified Dugan knew what
he was doing, but because of chronic
alcohol-induced mental illness, he did
not know it was wrong. Dugan should
be found:

A. Guilty, because voluntary intoxi-

cation is no excuse.

B. Guilty, because he knew the na-

Questions 20 - 22 are based on the
following facts:

One hour after sunset, Cyrus Sinner set out
to enjoy himself. He had two fine Canadian
beers at a local bar, then decided he would
like a date. No one was interested. He then
bragged to several men that he would have
a woman that night one way or another, even
if it had to be by force.

Cyrus decided to "create" a date with a
woman he had admired for months. He went
to Wanda's house and pushed her front win 
dow open with a crow bar. He put one foot
through and alarms went off. While running
away he was apprehended by Officer Tough,
who, while on patrol, was ordered by his
superior to investigate the alarms.

Tough placed Sinner under arrest, pursuant
to all legal requirements, but then, for good
measure, punched him in the stomach.

At trial, Sinner's attorney offered expert
medical testimony that Sinner was impotent.
Further, it was shown that Wanda was not
home that evening.

At trial, several instructions were given to
the jury, only one of which, the following,
however, has been appealed:

"Jury Instruction #7: I am now going to in 
struct you on the requirement of intent nec 
essary for the crime of burglary. Such re 
quires an intent to commit a felony. No one
can truly know what goes on in another

Otto was a "survivalist." He purchased a
semi-automatic Uzi machine gun at the lo-
cal gun shop. Even though he knew it to be
illegal, he modified the gun to be fully auto-
matic. The gun thus, at just one continuous
pull of the trigger, would keep on shooting
bullets.

Otto slept with the gun under his pillow. One
night, after Otto had anesthetized himself to
sleep (with a fifth of bourbon), Philip Pan-
ther broke into Otto's house. Although Pan-
ther was usually quite good at this kind of
thing, in this particular instance, he made a
tremendous racket entering. Otto's big 18 x
7 foot picture window overlooking the Pa-
cific was smashed.

Waking from his apocalyptical dream, Otto
grabbed his gun and ran to the scene of the
tumultuous entry. Panther was busily gath-
ering Otto's valuable cross-bow and arrow
collection. Otto, still legally intoxicated, and
in a blood rage, pulled the trigger. Otto be-
lieved he had to kill Panther to protect him-
self from Panther who had one cross-bow (a
deadly weapon) loaded and ready to fire.
Further, Otto wanted to kill Panther out of
the sheer joy of the kill. At Otto's one pull
of the trigger, fifteen bullets issued forth.
Thirteen of these entered the abdomen of
Panther.

One bullet, however, ricocheted off of Otto's
foosball table and flew through the smashed
window, through his next door neighbor's
open window, into the heart of his next door

neighbor, Sylvester. Houses in this neigh 
borhood were built very close together. Syl 
vester died instantly.

Otto put down his gun and called the police.
Mrs. Sylvester called an ambulance. Before
the ambulance or police came, she lit up a
torch, ran over to Otto's house, confronted
him through the smashed window, and
screamed, "I'll kill you, you crazy survivalist
nut! You killed my husband!"

Dumbfounded, Otto just stared at Mrs.
Sylvester. He then said, "Relax." Mrs.
Sylvester threw a makeshift torch at Otto.
The torch chipped a piece of glass away on
its way into the house. Otto ducked out of
the way. She fled. The torch ignited Otto's
home.

Otto called the fire department and waited
outside. Captain Ignite arrived in the city
firetruck. He knew Otto, and hated him. He
therefore purposely took his time in setting
up the hoses. His willful delay, in fact, caused
Otto's house to bum down.

On Sunday, March 17, 1991, Charles went
to Newport Beach with his girlfriend,
Denise. While Charles was surfing, Denise
rested in the sun, and read a book. This was
their typical Sunday afternoon behavior.
Charles and Denise had been dating for
about three years and planned to marry in
June. They were going to open their own
specialty surf shop.

While Charles was searching for the perfect
wave, about 100 feet from Denise, Edward
walked up to Denise and struck up a con 
versation. Denise had dated Edward before
she met Charles. Bored with Charles, and
remembering the good times she had with
Edward, Denise offered Edward a seat be 
side her. Remembering how much they cared
for each other, they talked, and soon began
to kiss.

Shortly thereafter Charles returned to dis 
cover their intimacy. Denise was startled and
said, "I'm sorry Charles, it's not what you
think."

Charles said, "It's cool Denise" and walked
off. However, as he walked away he, became
angrier and angrier. He turned around and
approached Denise and Edward. Edward
said, "Beat it wimp."

Charles grabbed Edward by the neck and
applied pressure to the carotid artery. Ed 
ward died from strangulation. Charles let go

Questions 67 - 70 are based on the
following facts:

Grunch was a law student convinced that
most of his time in law school was wasted.
He sat behind Betty, who he found to be very
attractive. As his own little game, he would
play with Betty's long pretty hair. Betty told
him to stop.

One day, during Grunch's Torts class, he left
early. He noticed the car of the Torts profes 
sor, Phil, and no one else in the lot. Grunch
took out his own car keys, then "keyed" the
poor Prof's car. It left a nasty scratch.

Grunch then opened his own car. He had not
paid his law school for a gate card, but did
have several Chuck E. Cheese tokens, which
worked well in opening the gate. They were
the same size as the school's "guest" tokens.
He placed one in the gate-exit slot, the gate
pulled up, and he drove off.

suming that Betty did not notice, what,
if any crimes at common law did
Grunch commit?

A. He committed no crime, because
the touching was not offensive.

B. He committed no crime, because
this was the tort of battery.

Questions 71 - 77 are based on the
following facts:

With the intent to steal all the belongings in
what appeared to be a fine beachfront house,
Jennifer picked the front door lock and
walked in. She was nervous, because it was
a full moon and she thought someone might
notice. However, there was nothing what 
soever in the house. Evidently, due to the
recent rain and landslides, the occupants had
moved out. The house was to be tom down
- as it was deemed to be on highly unstable
ground. Jennifer left.

Instead of driving home, however, she went
to a liquor store and picked out a $175 bottle
of Single Malt Scotch. While no one was
looking, she scraped off the price tag and
put on a price tag from a bottle of cheap
Scotch. That price tag read $7.99. Jennifer
paid the clerk $7.99 for the Scotch, put the
receipt in her purse and left.

She had a few quick gulps of the Scotch in
the car, felt a little "unsteady" from the al 
cohol, then drove home. It was a short drive
home, so Jennifer thought that there would
be no danger to herself or anyone. On her
way home, however, she missed seeing a
pedestrian (because of her intoxication) and
hit him. The pedestrian, Robert, was badly
injured and died from his wounds two weeks
later.

Miranda was prone to jealousy anyway, but
her new boyfriend, Stone, brought out the
worst in her. Although they supposedly had
a one-on-one relationship, Stone dated sev 
eral other women contemporaneously.
Miranda queried Stone about this, but he was
adamant and somewhat convincing in his
denials.

As a result of the above, Miranda decided to
"get Stone in a way that really hurt." One
late evening, Miranda called Stone up and
relayed to him the following ever-so-brief
conversation: "Come right over, Stone. I re 
ally want to make love."

Stone replied, "On my way." Stone jumped
into his car and made it to Miranda's apart 
ment in record time. He couldn't find the
key which Miranda had given him, so he
forced the front door open. He went to
Miranda's bedroom, found her naked in bed
and proceeded to have sexual relations with
her. However, soon after genital penetration,
Miranda said, "Stop. You're a heel and I'm
done with you. Get out of my house...now!"

he left the car unlocked and the keys in the
ignition. He sat in a cozy booth and ordered
a sandwich and a soft drink. The waiter mis

should have totaled $4.88; but the waiter
totaled it as $3.59. The waiter gave Mason
the bill along with the food. Mason at once
observed that the bill was too low, and pon 
dered whether he would bother to correct it
with the waiter. While sipping the soft drink
and munching on the "Double Bypass" sand

END OF QUESTIONS

2. C is correct. The jury instruction de 
fined a basic crime (false pretenses) but
left out any mens rea requirement. As a
general rule, true crimes should include
a mens rea and if they do not, there is a
possible due process violation. A is in 
correct because no facts whatsoever
were set out. Thus, one cannot reason 
ably conclude whether the evidence was
sufficient or insufficient. B is incorrect
for the same reason that C is correct. D
is incorrect because false pretenses re 
quires obtaining title, not "documentary
title." Documentary title is, in fact, not
a legal term of significance.

CRIMINAL LAW
ANSWERS

1. A is the "best" answer but it is not the
only correct answer. The Columbia stat 
ute punishes for substance addiction.
But, although the addict likely often has
a guilty mental state (the desire to have
the drug), he need not necessarily have
done any action whatsoever. Crimes
which so punish often violate due pro 
cess. They are called "status" crimes  
because they punish guilty status only.
Our system of justice requires that sta 
tus not be punished unless there also
occurs a guilty action (actus reus) and
guilty mental state (mens rea). Answer
A correctly, though briefly, states the
above reasoning. B is incorrect because
substance addiction, as a matter of law,
is considered to be voluntary intoxica 
tion only. Such is based on public policy
(to deter drug use) and because the first
use of the drug was voluntary. C is the
second best answer. This statutory
crime probably does not have a mens
rea, is therefore strict liability and strict
liability crimes are not preferred. How 
ever, answer A gives a more precise
description ofthe problem. D, although
arguably correct, is again far less pre 
cise than A.

CRIMINAL LAW I:Em

3. B is the correct answer. Solicitation to
commit burglary is enticing another to
commit burglary with the intent that the
other commit burglary. (Modernly, bur 
glary is the entry of the structure of an 
other with the intent to commit a felony
or petty larceny.) The facts stipulate that
Randy and Ready tried to get Able to
commit burglary and that Able declined.
Since there was a serious request to do
burglary, both elements of solicitation
are established. A is incorrect because
conspiracy requires that there be a meet 
ing of the minds and actual intent to do
a crime. Here, since Able declined, there
was no meeting of the minds and no
intent on the part of Able. C is incor 
rect because attempt requires that there
be a substantial step (dangerous prox 
imity to success), and here at the time
of the enticement the parties were not
nearly close enough to commission of
the crime. D is incorrect for the same
reason that B is correct - solicitation is
a crime and the enticement is a suffi 
cient actus reus (guilty action).

4. A is the best answer. Ready and Randy
had permission to borrow Able's car to
buy groceries - but not to commit a bur 
glary. This fraudulent misuse is an em 
bezzlement. Since they did not obtain
title to the car, Choice B is wrong. There
was no "false pretenses." Choice C is
wrong because there is no such crime
as "malicious trespass." Since Ready
and Randy did not have an intent to per 
manently deprive Able of his car (the
last element of larceny by trick) there
is no larceny by trick. Therefore, D is
incorrect.

5. B is correct. Ready and Randy entered
into a warehouse (walled structure) in 
tending to and committing a larceny.
Thus, all of the elements of modem bur 
glary have been satisfied. A is incorrect
because common law burglary requires
the breaking and entry occur at night
and to a dwelling house. Those two el 
ements are lacking here. C and Dare
incorrect for the same reason that B is
correct.

11m CRIMINAL LAW

6. C is correct. Larceny is the trespassory
(here, stealing) taking (stealing) and
carrying away (stolen from warehouse)
of the personal property of another (here
the painting) with the intent to perma 
nently deprive. The facts indicate that
all of the elements are present. Thus, a
larceny has been committed. A is incor 
rect because for there to be an em 
bezzlement, the defendant must be in
lawful possession of the property. Here,
Randy and Ready did not have lawful
possession of the painting. B is incor 
rect because false pretenses requires
that the defendant obtain title to the
property. Here, Ready and Randy did
not get title. D is incorrect for the same
reason that C is correct.

7. D is the best answer. Since Randy and
Ready were still in the process of hid 
ing the painting they were, arguably,
still in perpetration of the burglary. Use
of the felony murder rule, requires the
defendant to be in perpetration (includ 
ing, as here, flight from) of an inher 
ently dangerous felony (like burglary)
and that a death be the result. Use of
the felony-murder rule, at common law,
did not require that the defendant do or
even initiate the killing. Thus, Randy
can be found guilty of Ready's death,
even though it was a police officer who
did the killing. The killing was the re 
sult of the warehouse burglary. Thus,
D is the best answer. A is incorrect be 
cause, although the homicide could be
argued to be an involuntary manslaugh 
ter, there was absolutely no false pre 
tenses. That is, Randy did not obtain
title to the painting. B is incorrect be 
cause common law burglary requires
the breaking and entry occur at night
and to a dwelling. C is incorrect because
voluntary manslaughter also requires
there be "legally adequate provoca 
tion." Being upset because of resistance
to your burglary is objectively quite in 
adequate.

CRIMINAL LAW III

8. B is the best answer. Necessity or choice
of evils is a complete defense to all
crimes except murder and rape. Neces 
sity allows doing a criminal act in or 
der to avoid a greater calamity. Here,
since Sam was starving, stealing some
food (larceny) was better than his own
death. This, in fact, is a paraphrasing of
Sir Francis Bacon's famous maxim. A
is incorrect because when Sam took the
food (the actus reus), he intended to
steal it (the mens rea). Thus, the mens
rea and actus reus of larceny did con 
cur. C simply misreads the question.
The issue is not burglary here, but lar 
ceny of the ring. D is incorrect only
because it is imprecise. Due process or
"fundamental fairness" would be vio 
lated by punishing here, but the defense
of necessity is the more accurate legal
explanation.

9. A is correct. Attempt requires there be
a substantial step and that intent to do
the crime be present. Here, the facts
stipulate Sam did have the requisite in 
tent. However, after he formed the in 
tent he took no action - he simply took
a nap! Thus, there was not a substantial
step and the first element of attempt was
lacking. B is factually incorrect. Lar 
ceny is a crime against possession.
Here, however, the ring was not aban 
doned. It was still in possession of the
owner. It need not be on the victim's
person for there to be a larceny. Such
confuse the requirements of larceny
with those of robbery. C misreads the
question. The issue here is larceny of
the ring, not larceny of the food. More 
over, C is also incorrect because any
movement satisfies the carrying away/
asportation element. D is factually in 
correct. It is absurd to conclude that all
chattels in a summer home are "aban 
doned."

1m CRIMINAL LAW

10. C is correct. Burglary, at common law,
requires there be a breaking. This ele 
ment is satisfied when there is any
movement of the structure. Here, the
facts stipulate that the back door (where
Sam entered) was completely open.
Thus, there was no breaking. A is in 
correct because diminished capacity
was not a common law defense. B is
incorrect. Burglary is a crime against
habitation, but this was a habitation.
Having slept there and intending to
sleep there again is all that is required.
Since it was a summer home with quite
a few effects in it (food, ring, couch,
etc.), we can certainly infer the dwell 
ing requirements have been satisfied. D
is incorrect because the defense of com 
pulsion (or duress) requires that another
human threaten the defendant with im 
minent violence, so that the defendant
will commit a crime. There was no com 
pulsion here. This option confuses com 
pulsion with necessity.

11. D is the best answer. Frank, at 6 years
old, was irrebuttably presumed inca 
pable of committing a crime at common
law under the infancy defense. A is in 
correct because any movement of the
structure satisfies the breaking element,
and here the window was pushed open
wider. B is incorrect only because D is
a better answer. The boys' intent was to
assault, which was not a common law
felony. However, since B requires
weighing of facts and making infer 
ences, whereas D is obviously right be 
cause Frank's age is given, D is the bet 
ter answer. C is incorrect because it cre 
ates facts. No consent to enter was stipu 
lated or even implied.

12. B is the best answer. Conspiracy re 
quires there be an actual intent to do
the target crime. Involuntary man 
slaughter requires there be an uninten 
tional killing. There can, therefore, be
no conspiracy to do this crime. It is a
contradiction in terms. A is incorrect be 
cause manslaughter does not merge (is
not a lesser included offense) of bur 
glary. They are distinct crimes. C is in 
correct because guilt of "another crime"
does not relieve guilt. This statement is
silly. D is correct - there was no intent
to kill. However, B which dismisses the
validity of the whole charge, is a better
answer.

CRIMINAL LAW III

14. B is the best answer. An accessory af 
ter the fact or obstruction ofjustice, with
knowledge of the existence of a com 
pleted crime, helps hinder the arrest of
the perpetrator. Modernly, close rela 
tives, like the perpetrator's mother, are
often not prosecuted. Nevertheless, B
is the best answer, since the others are
entirely incorrect. Ais incorrect because
Don's mother did not agree with another
to commit a crime. C is incorrect be 
cause Don's mother was not a perpe 
trator of the robbery. D is incorrect be 
cause Don's mother was not involved
in the planning of the robbery.

13. A is the correct answer. Involuntary
manslaughter is the unintentional un 
lawful killing of a human with crimi 
nal negligence or when done in the per 
petration of a malum in se unlawful act.
Here, Jesse unintentionally killed Hart
by assaulting him. This action evi 
denced criminal negligence (Jesse
should have known of the risk) and also
satisfied the unlawful act-manslaughter
rule (assault is a malum in se unlawful
act). B is incorrect. Second degree mur 
der requires the presence of malice
aforethought. Here, there was no ex 
press malice (no intent to kill). Like 
wise, there was no intent to cause seri 
ous bodily injury and no conscious,
reckless disregard of the risk. Since
malice aforethought was lacking, there
was no murder in the second degree. C
is incorrect, factually and legally. This
was not an intentionallheat of passion
killing. It was an accidental killing.
Therefore, voluntary manslaughter is
incorrect, factually. Furthermore, it is
involuntary manslaughter and not vol 
untary manslaughter which is linked up
with the unlawful act-manslaughter
rule. C is, therefore, also legally incor 
rect. D is incorrect because accidental
killings certainly can lead to criminal
homicide convictions. Felony-murder
and involuntary manslaughter are two
such examples.

1m CRIMINAL LAW

15. C is correct. If a defendant commits a
crime while under the influence of
drugs or alcohol, even if the drugs make
him delusional, insanity is not available.
Only voluntary intoxication is relevant.
However, if the defendant has caused
himself brain damage by chronic use
of drugs - and is not then under the in 
fluence, insanity is relevant. Such is the
stipulated situation in this question.
Under the prevailing majority and com 
mon law M'Naghten insanity test,
Dugan had mental illness, a defect of
reason (the devil message) and did not
know this killing was wrong. Therefore,
M'Naghten is satisfied and Dugan is
legally insane. A is incorrect because
Dugan was not here intoxicated and is
also incorrect because voluntary intoxi 
cation cannot be a defense to a malice
crime like murder. B is incorrect. Al 
though Dugan did know what he was
doing (the nature and quality of his
acts), this element is only an option in
the M'Naghten test. M'Naghten can
also be satisfied if the defendant does
not know what he is doing to be wrong
- as here. D is incorrect because the
mistake of fact defense, for a malice
crime like common law murder, re 
quires the mistake to be objectively rea 
sonable. D is incorrect because it mis 
states the relevant law.

16. B is the correct answer. Battery is gen 
erally a low-grade misdemeanor. There
was certainly a battery here, as evi 
denced by the slaps. A and C are each
incorrect for two reasons. First, false
imprisonment and kidnapping are more
serious crimes. Second, it does not ap 
pear that there was a confinement  
thus, neither crime was committed. D
is incorrect because the negligent inflic 
tion of emotional distress is not a crime.
It is a tort.

17. B is the correct answer. Although it is a
close call, it appears that Bouncer com 
mitted two batteries: the initial shove
and the secondary slap. Thus, II is a bet 
ter choice. Moreover, since assault is a
lesser included offense of battery and
since there was an intentional scarring
(by way of the threat), III is also cor 
rect. Only answer B includes both II and
III.

18. A is the correct answer. The malice
aforethought element of murder can be
shown by an intent to kill. Vieux obvi 
ously possessed such. Since the other
elements of murder are present, such is
the correct crime. B is incorrect because
first degree murder was not a crime at
the common law. C is incorrect because
a requirement of voluntary manslaugh 
ter is that the killing follow immediately
upon the passion-provoking incident. A
day's wait is too long. D is incorrect
because involuntary manslaughter cov 
ers only unintentional killings, and this
killing was on purpose.

CRIMINAL LAW 1m

22. D is the correct answer. After a crime
has been committed, a crime by an of 
ficer does not retroactively limit the
guilt of the original perpetrator. Thus,
Tough's battery of Sinner is irrelevant.
A, Band C are incorrect for the same
reason that D is correct.

23. A is the correct answer. This is a very
tricky question. Since Smoak was the
manager, he was in more than mere cus 
tody and, thus, was capable of embez 
zling Tarno. Since he did not put
Chewer's money into the register, the
$6.88 he took out was Tamo's. Further,
he deprived Tamo of the $3.12. Thus,
he embezzled a total of $10. I is correct
and II is incorrect. Since it appears that
Smoak intended to steal Chewer's $100
before obtaining possession, the crime
is larceny (not embezzlement). Thus, III
is correct. II and IV are incorrect for
the same reasons that I and III are cor 
rect. Only choice A offers I and III.

24. D is the correct answer. In a slim ma 
jority of jurisdictions, an honest claim
of right negates the intent element of
the theft crimes. For that reason A, B
and C are incorrect.

19. C is the correct answer. Vieux had a
good faith but unreasonable belief that
the killing was necessary to protect her 
self- the exact requirement of this par 
tial defense. A is incorrect because
Vieux was the aggressor the following
evening -thus, self-defense is not avail 
able. B is incorrect because it was stipu 
lated that Vieux was legally sane. D is
incorrect because C is correct.

20. C is the correct answer. The entry ele 
ment of burglary is satisfied when any
part of the perpetrator's body penetrates
the dwelling. Since Sinner's foot pen 
etrated, C is a bad choice. A and Bare
incorrect because Sinner did intend to
rape, as stipulated in the facts. D is in 
correct because the jury instruction cor 
rectly defined the mens rea necessary
and correctly discussed whose burden
it was to prove such.

21. C is the correct answer. Attempted rape
requires that Sinner took a substantial
step toward rape (shown here by the
breaking and entering) and that he had
the intent to rape (shown here by the
facts). Thus, I and II are correct. Since
Sinner, in fact, intended to rape, and
rape is a crime, there was merely a fac 
tual impossibility - which is not a de 
fense. Thus, III is correct and IV is in 
correct. Only C offers I, II and III.

1m CRIMINAL LAW

25 . D is the correct answer. Deadly force is
never permissible when used merely to
protect property. Chewer's action was
larceny and Smoak used deadly force.
D, alone, states this relevant legal rule.
The guilt of the victim is irrelevant to
this question - thus, Band C are incor 
rect. Furthermore, A is incorrect be 
cause the earlier guilt of the perpetra 
tor is not relevant in this case.

26. B is the correct answer. Malicious mis 
chief covers the damaging of property.
A is incorrect because there was no dis 
membering. C and D are incorrect be 
cause there was no "taking" (control)
of any property.

27. C is the best answer. Often statutory
rape is considered to be strict liability;
thus, there are no defenses. However,
since such is not an option, we must
choose the "best" answer given. Cer 
tainly A is incorrect because consent is
not an element of this crime. Actually,
the alleviation of consent is the grava 
men of this offense. B is also totally
incorrect - Ted is obviously of age, so
the infancy defense is unavailable to
him. Since Ted in no way misunder 
stood the law, D is also incorrect. Thus,
we are left with C as the best choice.
Ted thought Jan was his wife and this
was a reasonable mistake under the cir 
cumstances.

28. B is the correct answer. Choice I is in 
correct because rape, at common law,
could not be committed by females.
Choice III is incorrect because for there
to be a burglary there must be "the in 
tent to commit a felony." Jan's intent
was, at worst, to commit the misde 
meanor of battery. Since Jan "offen 
sively" touched Ted, there is a battery.
Only II (and B) are correct.

29. Ais the best answer. Modernly, infancy
can be defined as under 18 years of age.
Jan is 17, so she might have such a de 
fense. B is incorrect since, literally, pub 
lic policy is not a defense. C is incor 
rect because Ted's consent was gained
by gross fraud/impersonation. Fraud in
the factum invalidates consent. D is in 
correct because in no way would the
equal protection clause mandate pref 
erential treatment of young women.

30. D is the correct answer. The sexual ag 
gressiveness of an underage female is
irrelevant to a charge of statutory rape.
Thus, choices I and III are incorrect.
Choice II is incorrect because the guilt
of the "victim" is not a defense at crirni 
nallaw. Choice IV is incorrect because
voluntary intoxication is not a defense
to a strict liability crime.

CRIMINAL LAW 1m

31. A is the correct answer. When Fawn
asked Jo to kill her, she was enticing Jo
to commit a murder. Thus, there was a
solicitation. Consent of the victim is no
defense to murder. Since Fawn did not
take a substantial step, there is no at 
tempt, and, thus, B is incorrect. Since
Jo did not agree, there is no conspiracy
and C is incorrect. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that A is correct.

32. D is the correct answer. Since Dr. Donna
only thought about killing Fawn: only
intended to kill. Thus, there was no
crime. Mens rea alone cannot be pun 
ished. Thus, A, Band C are incorrect.

33. C is the correct answer. When Ned used
the syringe on Fawn, there was an un 
lawful application of force - thus, I is
correct. When he decided to kill Fawn
and took the syringe and drugs, there
was a substantial step - and at that in 
stant there was the intent to kill. The
taking of the hospital's drugs and sy 
ringe was trespassory - thus, there was
a larceny. Only choice C includes I, II
and III.

1m CRIMINAL LAW

34. C is the correct answer. Note: the call
of this question is phrased in the nega 
tive. Since Donna died within a year of
the attack and from the attack, the "year
and a day" rule is inapplicable. So Jo
should not argue I (but I is correct be 
cause of the negative call of the ques 
tion). Although Jo was misinformed as
to who tried to kill her sister (it was
actually Ned), use of the mistake of fact
defense requires that: were the facts as
the defendant believed them to be the
conduct would not be criminal. But,
here, Jo's attack would still be unjusti 
fied. J0 should not make this argument
- thus, II is also correct. Since Fawn
was in no further danger, the imminence
element of defense of others is lacking,
so the argument in IV also should not
be made. Only choice C includes all of
these poor arguments. Since Jo was act 
ing under reasonable provocation, op 
tion III would be a viable argument.

35. C is the best answer. When an individual
is reasonably provoked (here by the at 
tempt on her sister's life), is actually
upset (stipulated in the facts), and has
insufficient time to "cool down" (the
attack occurred soon after the passion 
provoking incident) the rule of provo 
cation will mitigate murder to volun 
tary manslaughter. Although A, dimin 
ished capacity, is also a mitigation de 
fense, because it is such an extreme mi 
nority position, C is a better choice. B
and D are incorrect because they are not
mitigating factors. Rather, they are
complete defenses, excuses.

36. B is the correct answer. Since Joe was
in a managerial position, he had "law 
ful possession" of the money - not mere
custody. Since the other elements of em 
bezzlement are present, that is the cor 
rect choice. A is incorrect for the same
reasons that B is correct, i.e., there was
no trespass in the taking. C is incorrect
because, when there is a lawful posses 
sion, there is no trespass - which is a
requirement of larceny by trick. Al 
though there was a "trick," there was
no trespass - and, thus, no larceny by
trick. D is incorrect because title did not
pass, and such is a necessary element
of false pretenses.

37. D is the best answer. Clearly Joe com 
mitted a theft (based on embezzlement)
of Walls' accounts. Grand versus petty
theft is determined by fair market value
of what is stolen. A typical cut-off fig 
ure is $400. Although the facts are un 
clear as to the amount stolen, a reason 
able inference is that it was an "enor 
mous sum." Thus, D is better than C. A
is incorrect because no facts indicate Joe
received stolen property. B is incorrect
because fraud is not a crime.

38. A is the correct answer. Misprision is
the knowing concealment of the felony
of another. Walls' cover-up appears to
be such. B is incorrect because corpo 
rations can be found guilty of crimes.
C is incorrect because Joe likely com 
mitted a grand theft. D is incorrect for
the same reasons that A is correct.

39. D is the correct answer. I is incorrect,
since Mean neither threatened nor at 
tempted a battery. II is incorrect, since
Mean applied force to no one. III and
IV are incorrect, since they are torts, not
crimes. Thus, A, Band C, which include
I, II, III or IV, are incorrect.

40. B is the best answer. Since Shark and
Kerr reached a criminal agreement,
there was a conspiracy. Although Shark
also solicited Kerr, such merges in the
conspiracy. Therefore, A is not the best
answer. Since, at the time of hiring, no
substantial step was taken, there is no
attempt. C is incorrect. Similarly, at the
time of the hiring, no killing had oc 
curred - so there is no murder. D is in 
correct.

41. A is the correct answer. Since Shark
hired Kerr to kill Mean, such evidences
the premeditation and deliberation nec 
essary for first degree murder. More 
over, since Shark and Kerr were in
criminal combination, there was a con 
spiracy. Since only choice A includes
both of these crimes, it is the correct
answer.

CRIMINAL LAW 1m

45. B is the best answer. Note: The call of
this question is phrased in the negative.
We are looking for the worst argument.
Since ownership is not a requirement
oflarceny, this choice is truly poor. Al 
though this is a difficult, hair-splitting
question, it is somewhat typical of mul 
tiple choice exams. A is incorrect be 
cause the fact that property is lost can
sometimes preclude a conviction oflar 
ceny (if the intent to steal forms after
the taking), but sometimes is irrelevant
(if the intent forms prior to or at the time
of the taking). Thus, A is a mediocre
argument. C is incorrect because some 
times abandonment is a defense to lar 
ceny. Similarly, choice D is incorrect
because consent by the lawful posses 
sion is a defense to larceny.

46. D is the correct answer. Lott's taking
of the ring, which was then in lawful
possession, would amount to a grand
theft modernly (not a larceny - the com 
mon law term). Thus, II is correct and I
is incorrect. III is correct because a dam 
age to another's property is often, mod 
ernly, called "vandalism." Choice IV is
correct because, modernly, burglary
only requires an entry into a structure
with felonious intent. Only choice D
offers II, III and IV.

42. C is the correct answer. Kerr and Shark
were in criminal combination, thus,
choice I is correct. When Kerr killed
Mean, there was a premeditated intent
to kill, thus, satisfying the mens rea el 
ement of murder in the first degree.
Thus, choice II is correct. Modem law
burglary does not require the breaking
of a dwelling. Kerr broke into Mean's
office. Only choice C offers choices I,
II and III.

43. D is the best answer. Since when Lott
picked up the ring initially his intent
was neither to steal (larceny) nor to de 
fraud (embezzlement), A and B are in 
correct. C is incorrect for two reasons:
first, trespass is not a crime; and sec 
ond, even if it were, there is no trespass
when finding lost property provided
one's intent is to tum it in.

44. C is the correct answer. Choice I is cor 
rect because all of the elements of lar 
ceny are present (Lott took ring with
intent to keep it). Although one might
argue the "of another" element was
lacking, it was present. This element
refers to whether the "victim" (here the
police) had, at the time of the taking, a
lawful possession. They did. One can
commit larceny on property owned by
oneself. Choice II is also correct, be 
cause there was damage to the property
of another (the window) and, thus, there
was a malicious mischief. Since the
breaking and entering was not of a
dwelling, choice III (burglary) is not
present. Only choice C offers I and II.

Elm CRIMINAL LAW

47. C is the best answer. Mayhem includes
not only disfigurement; but also any
permanent damage to the body interfer 
ing with self-defense abilities. Paraly 
sis qualifies as such. Since the most
serious crime is always to be chosen
(unless the call of the question directs
otherwise), although there was a bat 
tery, such is not the best answer. There 
fore, A is incorrect. Choices Band D
are incorrect because John gave a con 
ditional consent - only and such is lim 
ited to the condition allowed. John did
not consent to the sleeper hold - he con 
sented to faking the sleeper hold.

48. B is the correct answer. Although this
is a close one, the involuntary intoxica 
tion defense would alleviate Snake's
guilt -since it was stipulated the hor 
mones were doctor-prescribed and that
they created a mental disorder (aggres 
siveness). A is incorrect for the same
reasons that B is correct. Although it
can be argued that Snake committed a
manslaughter, since his response to the
fan was based on words alone, the
provocation was insufficient. C is there 
fore incorrect. D is incorrect because
in order to utilize self-defense, there
must be an imminent attack and only
reasonable force may be used. Neither
situation here existed.

49. D is the best answer, because A, Band
C are incorrect. A is incorrect because
the gun was not "the property of an 
other" - an element of malicious mis 
chief. B is incorrect because there was
no sexual activity. C is incorrect be 
cause no aid was given to the enemies
of the state.

50. C is the correct answer. Panther fulfilled
all the elements of burglary. Moreover,
since Panther obtained control of at least
a cross-bow there was a larceny, as welL
Only choice C offers both burglary and
larceny.

51. B is the best answer. Otto used exces 
sive force per the statute. Thus, he is
responsible for Panther's injury. Al 
though the injury is likely more than a
battery, such is the best option listed. A
and C are incorrect for the same reason
that B is correct. D is incorrect because
Panther is still alive.

52. C is the correct answer. Either under the
misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, or
under the criminal negligence method,
Otto is responsible for the death of
Sylvester. Since the killing was unin 
tentional, all of the elements of invol 
untary manslaughter have been satis 
fied. There is no burglary at common
law, since there was no "breaking" and
no "intent to commit a felony." Thus,
A, Band D are incorrect. Additionally,
B is incorrect because there was no
malice, a requirement of murder.

CRIMINAL LAW Ell

53. A is the correct answer. Choice I is cor 
rect because there was a burning of
Otto's dwelling. Choice II is correct
because the torch not only broke the
window, but was also used to try to
complete the intended felony (murder).
Thus, legally there was an entry - even
though Mrs. Sylvester did not person 
ally enter Otto's home. Choice III is
correct because Mrs. Sylvester took a
substantial step toward completion of
murder with the intent to kill. Since Mr.
Sylvester was not then in danger, de 
fense of others is unavailable. Only A
offers I, II, and III.

54. D is the correct answer. This is a diffi 
cult question. More than one party can
be guilty of a single crime - even if they
were acting independently - provided
that both perpetrators were substantial
factors (causation), as here. Moreover,
if there is a legal duty to act and no act
is performed, the perpetrator is crimi 
nally liable under an omission theory.
Such was our situation. A is incorrect
because "willful delay" is not a crime.
B is incorrect because "culpable omis 
sion" is not a crime - it is merely a
method of proving causation. C is in 
correct because such is not a crime.

55. D is the correct answer. At the common
law, the inflicted wound must result in
death within "a year and a day." As
stipulated, the death here took two
years. Thus, all of the homicides: A, B
and C are incorrect. At worst, under
these facts, there would be a battery or
mayhem. These options were not of 
fered.

56. B is the correct answer. Choice I is in 
correct because the statute was highly
relevant, as shown by the following.
Choice II is correct because Otto did
willfully modify the gun. Choices III,
IV and V are correct because, by defi 
nition, use of such a weapon precludes
use of defenses which would otherwise
be available. Use of such a weapon is
a, per se, unreasonable use of force.
Only B includes choices II, III, IV and
V.

57. A is the correct answer. Since there was
a trespass in the taking of the car, and
the intent to permanently deprive
formed during the taking, there is a con 
tinuing trespass larceny. B is incorrect
since no facts indicate that Layla got
possession by trick. C is incorrect since
no facts indicate that Layla was en 
trusted (lawful possession of Eric's car).
D is incorrect because title to Eric's car
did not pass; thus, there can be no false
pretenses.

BiB CRIMINAL LAW

58. D is the correct answer. Since the mens
rea of burglary (intent to commit a
felony) must concur with the actus reus
(breaking and entering, etc.), and at the
time of the breaking there was no felo-
nious intent, there can be no burglary.
Thus, choice I is incorrect. Since Cindy
stole the food, there was a simple lar-
ceny; and choice II is correct. Since
Cindy was not entrusted in lawful pos-
session, of the food, there is no em-
bezzlement and, thus, choice III is in-
correct. Only D offers choice II alone.

59. D is the correct answer. For there to be
a burglary, there must be intent to com-
mit a felony in the dwelling. Mike did
not have the required intent. Thus, D is
correct. A is incorrect because it misses
this fundamental requirement. B is in-
correct because the issue is not whether
a felony was actually committed, but
rather was the intent felonious. C is in-
correct because entry by instrumental-
ity is valid if, as here, the instrumental-
ity is used to complete the felony. In
this case, the bullet was used to kill.

60. C is the correct answer. The killing was
a classic "depraved heart" killing. Mike
was aware of the substantial risk to hu-
man life, and ignored such. A and Bare
incorrect because they are modern
crimes. D is incorrect for the same rea-
son that C is correct.

61. D is the best answer. A correct answer
requires knowledge of a hairline distinc-
tion. Dogs were not personal property
at the common law, so technically this
was not a malicious mischief. Both B
and C were not common law crimes,
so D is the best answer.

62. C is the best answer. When the bullet
penetrated the roof, it probably dam-
aged something in Arnold's home -
thus, there was probably a malicious
mischief. Although this is not a "cor-
rect" answer, it is the "least worst" of
the alternatives. As such, this is a very
tricky question. Choices II, III and IV
are all incorrect because these crimes
required three perpetrator participants.

63. C is the correct answer. The killing was
a classic heat of passion killing. There
was provocation (the betrayal), passion
(Charles' anger), and insufficient time
to cool. Thus, II is correct and I is in-
correct. When Charles threatened and
chased Denise there was an assault; but,
since there was no application of force,
there was not a battery. Thus, III is cor-
rect and IV is incorrect. Only Coffers
the above.

64. D is the best answer. Since an acciden-
tal spilling of beer on a person evi-
dences no mens rea whatsoever,
Choices A, Band C are incorrect; and
D is the best answer.

CRIMINAL LAW E!S

65. A is the correct answer. This is a clas 
sic involuntary manslaughter, based on
the misdemeanor (unlawful act) theory,
Arnold committed a battery and Beth
died accidentally as a result of such.
Thus, choice I is correct and II is incor 
rect. Since Arnold was upset and sim 
ply "forgot" to pay for his food, there
was no specific intent to defraud or de 
prive; thus, choices III and IV are in 
correct. A, alone, includes only choice
I.

66. B is the correct answer. False Impris 
onment occurs when another is con 
fined without consent. Confinement
does not require there be a room. Thus,
in this fact pattern, Hannah's movement
was confined in the open fields - by
way of gun threat. A is incorrect because
Rape requires sexual penetration. C is
incorrect because Battery requires there
to be an application of force and none
was shown here. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that B is correct.

67. C is the correct answer. Battery is an
unlawful application of force to the per 
son of another. Gronch's touching of
Betty's hair was purposeful and cer 
tainly unapproved or "offensive." Betty,
in the facts, did say to stop. Of course,
had Betty consented, there would have
been no Battery. Therefore, although C
could have been more legally precise,
it is a correct answer - and, as it turns
out, the best of the group. A misreads
the facts - Betty told Gronch to stop  
therefore, it was offensive. B is legally
incorrect because a given act can be
both a tort and a crime. Such are en 
tirely separate issues. D is incorrect for
the same reason that C is correct.

68. D is the correct answer. Malicious mis 
chief is the malicious damaging of
another's property. Since Grunch
scratched (damaged) the car, since it
was Phil's and since he did it purposely
(thereby satisfying the malice element),
all the elements are met. A is incorrect
because nothing in the common law
crime of malicious mischief requires the
vandalism to be irreparable. B is incor 
rect because such is a tort, not a crime.
C is incorrect because there was no tak 
ing, carrying away... or for that matter
- there were few elements of theft
proven by the facts.

e CRIMINAL LAW

69. B is the correct answer. This is a very
difficult question. Choice I is incorrect
because forgery requires the making of
a false document. Although it is argu 
able the Grunch's token constituted a
document; it is quite clear, he did not
make it. Therefore, since one element
is missing, this crime is lacking. Choice
II, however, is probably correct. Utter 
ing only requires the using of a forged
instrument knowing it to be such. Al 
though a Chuck E. Cheese token, in the
context of going to Chuck E. Cheese,
is not false; using it as a token of value
somewhere else probably is. Moreover,
it was used to defraud the law school.
Thus, there probably was an uttering.
Choice III is incorrect, for two reasons.
First, false pretenses require the defen 
dant obtain title fraudulently. No facts
indicate Grunch to have obtained title
to the token, itself, fraudulently. Sec 
ondly, and more to the point, Grunch
received no title to anything of the vic 
tim law school. He simply borrowed a
parking space without paying. If the
intent to steal (defraud) forms prior to
obtaining possession, then the posses 
sion is not lawful and there can be no
embezzlement. In that instance, the
crime is larceny. Although the facts are
not perfectly clear, it appears that since
Grunch had the false token, he prob 
ably intended to use it prior to entering
the lot - so his possession of the park 
ing space was not in good faith. There 
fore, the crime is Larceny (choice IV),
not embezzlement (choice V). Since
only B includes just II and IV, it is the
correct answer.

70. B is the correct answer. Conversion with
fraudulent intent, by one with lawful
possession, constitutes the crime of
embezzlement. Since Grunch acciden 
tally took the tokens outside the restau 
rant, and since they were presumably
lent to him by the restaurant, he had the
requisite lawful possession. A is incor 
rect because for there to be a larceny
there must be an initial "trespass"  
here, there was none. C is incorrect be 
cause false pretenses requires there be
a passing of title; and there was none
here. D is incorrect for the same rea 
sons that B is correct.

71. C is the best answer. Note: the call
asked, which was the worst legal argu 
ment. Since no one has to be home, pro 
vided the house is a dwelling and the
perpetrator has felonious intent, choice
C is factually irrelevant. Choices A and
B, however, are actually good argu 
ments. Under the common law, aban 
doned houses are not considered to be
dwellings. So, there can be no common
law burglary of this stipulated-to-be
abandoned house. D is incorrect, for the
same reason that C is correct.

CRIMINAL LAW •

72. D is the correct answer. Forcible entry
entails the willful trespass onto the land
of another by force. The force required
is not necessarily destructive force.
Thus, Jennifer's picking of the lock sat 
isfies this element. Moreover, she was
clearly trespassing onto land - so all of
the elements are met. A is incorrect be 
cause an abandoned dwelling is not a
"dwelling" for common law burglary
purposes. B is incorrect for the same
reasons that D is correct. C, though a
correct statement, is not as precise a
definition of the common law crime
here committed.

73. C is the correct answer. When title is
obtained fraudulently, the crime is false
pretenses. Here, the lie was in the act
of changing price-tags and title passed
with the passing of the receipt. A and B
are incorrect because there was no tres 
pass in the taking. D is incorrect because
Jennifer was in bad faith, not "lawful
possession" of the Scotch - and such is
a requirement of embezzlement.

74. D is the correct answer. Jennifer com 
mitted the crime of false pretenses, be 
cause she obtained title fraudulently.
The fact that the clerk was an accom 
plice, does not alleviate Jennifer's guilt.
Of course, the answer would differ had
the owner known and consented to
Jennifer's actions. A is incorrect be 
cause the consent needed was of the
store owner - and no facts indicate such.
B is incorrect because condonation is
not a defense to a crime, once it is com 
pleted. Although C is a correct state 
ment of law, it is irrelevant because tres 
pass is not an element of false pretenses.

75. A is the correct answer. There is an
embezzlement when a trusted em 
ployee, in lawful possession of a chat 
tel, fraudulently converts it. That was
the situation here. B is incorrect because
there was no trespass by the clerk; and
this is an element of larceny. C is in 
correct because conversion is not a
crime. It is a tort, only. D is incorrect
because the clerk's actions satisfied all
of the elements of embezzlement. It is
irrelevant whether it was good business.

•

CRIMINAL LAW

76. C is the correct answer. Involuntary
manslaughter is essentially a criminally
negligent, accidental killing. Jennifer's
driving under the influence was such a
deviation from the reasonable standard
of care owed. Choices A and Dare in-
correct because they were not crimes
at common law (which is the stipulated
jurisdiction). Choice B is incorrect be-
cause murder requires malice afore-
thought. This mens rea can be proven
by an intent to kill (not present here),
intent to cause serious bodily injury
(also not present here), reckless/de-
praved heart (not present here because
Jennifer was unaware of the risk to life),
or felony-murder (not present here, be-
cause she was not in perpetration of a
dangerous felony).

77. D is the correct answer. At the common
law, the inflicted wound must produce
death within 12 months. This specific
rule of causation was called the "year
and a day" rule. Here, the death oc-
curred 13 months later. Choice A is in-
correct for the very same reasons that
D is correct. Choice B, though correct
analysis at common law, is far less spe-
cific than choice D. Thus, D is the bet-
ter answer. C is incorrect for the same
reasons that D is correct.

78. D is the correct answer. This is the case,
because A, B, and C were not crimes at
common law.

79. A is the best answer. Vandalism entails
the damaging of another's property.
Since the lockpicking was likely not
consented to, damage to the door is a
reasonable possibility. Band Dare
clearly incorrect because they were
crimes only at common law - and the
call stipulated [only] modern law
crimes. C is clearly incorrect because
no felonious intent (as required by bur-
glary) is indicated by a reasonable in-
terpretation of the facts.

80. A is correct. Under both the modem and
common law, the consent to engage in
sex can be withdrawn at any time - even
after sexual intercourse has com-
menced. B is a correct statement of fact,
but is irrelevant. C is incorrect for the
same reasons that A is correct. D is in-
correct, legally, because sexual penetra-
tion is all that is required for carnal
knowledge.

81. B is the correct answer. Malicious mis-
chief is the malicious damaging of the
property of another. Stone demonstrated
the requisite intent, and the smashing
certainly appears to be damage. More-
over, it was Miranda's picture. A and C
are incorrect because they were not
crimes at the common law. D is incor-
rect because uttering entails offering a
forged instrument- facts totally irrel-
evant here.

CRIMINAL LAW BiD

82. B is the correct answer. A killing, fol 
lowing a sexual betrayal, is the classic
voluntary manslaughter scenario. With
such, there is actual provocation, anger
and an immediate killing. A is incorrect
because when the elements of volun 
tary manslaughter are present, as here,
it takes precedence over murder. C is
incorrect because this crime requires the
killing to be unintentional. D is incor 
rect both legally and ethically.

83. D is the correct answer. A is incorrect
because there was no touching. B is in 
correct because there was neither a sub 
stantial step toward battery (there was
only "preparation"), nor was there an
intent to scare anyone. C is incorrect
because it requires reading in an essen 
tial fact not even hinted at, i.e., that it
was not his gun.

84. A is the correct answer. At common law,
malicious mischief included the dam 
aging of another's horse. Band C are
incorrect because they were not com 
mon law crimes. D is incorrect because
treason requires giving aid to the en 
emies of the state, and no facts suggest
this.

85. D is the best answer. There is a larceny,
provided the defendant intends to aban 
don the property in such a way that the
owner is unlikely to recover it. Although
these facts are amorphous on this point,
it is the best of the choices given. A is
an incorrect answer-many crimes in 
volve emotional outbursts - and such
is not a defense. B is incorrect because,
under the facts given, there was cer 
tainly a malicious mischief (vandalism)
and quite possibly a larceny. C is incor 
rect because Cereal was the "taker," not
the "receiver" of stolen property.

86. B is the correct answer. Cereal demon 
strated malice aforethought - by his in 
tent to either kill or seriously injure
Jane. Therefore, there was a second-de 
gree murder. A is incorrect because
there was no premeditation and delib 
eration regarding the killing of Jane  
and these are required elements of
first-degree murder. The anger Cereal
felt for Melody cannot be transferred
to reduce his crime on Jane. Thus, C,
voluntary manslaughter, is incorrect. D
is incorrect because the most reason 
able interpretation of the facts is that
Cereal either intended to kill or hurt
Jane seriously - thus, the more serious
crime of second-degree murder is
present. (The most serious homicide
committed will be the correct answer.)

•

CRIMINAL LAW

87. A is the correct answer. At the time of
the killing, Cereal was likely mentally
deranged and may not have known right
from wrong. B is incorrect for two rea 
sons: Killing an uninvolved third party
is not legally adequate provocation; and
this Rule is not a complete defense. C
is incorrect because it misreads the facts
- Cereal admitted he had not mistaken
Jane for Melody. D is incorrect because
this was not a common law defense, and
also because it is only a partial defense.

88. D is the best answer. Cereal's mental
faculties were diminished because of
the earlier betrayal. Although dimin 
ished capacity is a minority position, it
is the best of the choices given. A is
incorrect because killing an innocent
third party who simply has a resem 
blance to your ex-lover, is not legally
(objectively) valid provocation. B is
incorrect because Insanity is not a par 
tial defense. C is incorrect, because
Cereal did not have the belief that he
was in imminent physical danger.

89. D is the correct answer. The criminal
law does not require good behavior. It
simply prohibits bad conduct. Mason's
leaving alone the old man was unethi 
cal, but not illegal in any way. Thus,
the crimes offered in choices A, Band
C are incorrect answers.

90. D is the correct answer. When Mason
paid up, he received title to the food,
fraudulently. There was false pretenses.
A is incorrect because larceny requires
a trespass in the taking- and Mason re 
ceived the food consensually. B is in 
correct because larceny by trick requires
tricking the victim into giving the chat 
tel- since Mason did not trick the waiter
into producing the food, this crime was
not present. C is a more difficult analy 
sis. For there to be an embezzlement,
the perpetrator must be in lawful pos 
session prior to his misappropriation.
Therefore, D is the better answer. Ma 
son probably did not have "lawful pos 
session," as required for there to be an
embezzlement.

91. B is the correct answer. Petty theft is
the fraudulent misappropriation of
property worth, as a general rule, un 
der $400. The food fell within this fair
market value, and Mason had the req 
uisite intent to underpay. A is correct,
but less specific than B, and, therefore,
B is the better answer. C is incorrect
because grand theft entails misappro 
priation of property over $400 - cer 
tainly not the case here. D is incorrect
for the same reasons that B is correct.

CRIMINALLAW lim

94. D is the correct answer. There is no
theory in which Mason could be held
criminally responsible for the death of
the pedestrian. A is incorrect because
he was not a substantial factor. B is in 
correct because it is a tort doctrine; and
irrelevant in any case. C is incorrect
because it goes to the mental state of
taking a reckless risk to human life.
Mason did not possess such.

95. C is the correct answer. Wharton's Rule
indicates that if a crime requires a set
and necessary number of perpetrators,
if only that minimum number is in 
volved, then the perpetrators cannot be
convicted of both the conspiracy and
the target crime. The definition which
was given for Breach of the Peace re 
quires four individuals. That was the
number involved - so there cannot be
conviction for both the Breach and the
conspiracy. A is a possibly correct an 
swer - but it requires reading in facts  
so C is better. Like A, B requires read 
ing in unlikely facts; so choice C is a
better answer. D is a misinterpretation
of obvious social mores, and is there 
fore incorrect.

92. A is the correct answer. Grand theft is
the fraudulent misappropriation of
property valued at, as a general rule,
over $400. Mason's car certainly ex 
ceeded that amount and Teena's con 
duct gives rise to the inference that not
only did she misappropriate the car  
but also that she intended to defraud. B
is incorrect because petty theft covers
stealing property of value under $400  
and the car here was worth much more
than that. C is incorrect because no facts
indicate damage to the car (and such is
required for there to be a vandalism).
D misreads the facts: Neither actual nor
constructive consent was given.

93. A is the correct answer. Involuntary
manslaughter can be proven by show 
ing that the defendant's killing occurred
while perpetrating a "malum in se" (bad
in itself) crime. Here, Teena was in per 
petration of a larceny (car theft) and this
will allow use of the so-called
"misdemeanor-manslaughter" rule. B is
incorrect because no facts indicate
Teena's driving to be a gross deviation
from the reasonable standard of care
owed. C is incorrect because sufficiency
of the evidence is an appellate or
post-trial procedural defense. The call
of the question asked for prosecution
arguments. D is incorrect because "de 
praved heart" is a method of proving
malice aforethought. It is not an element
of involuntary manslaughter, and, thus,
is irrelevant to this question.

BID CRIMINALLAW

96. C offers the best choice in a series of
poor answers. Although it does appear
Finn was in possession of the mari 
juana, perhaps it can be argued that
Nasty simply left it at Finn's home, and
Finn had not exerted dominion and con 
trol over it. A is incorrect because Finn
clearly knew the substance to be mari 
juana. B is legally incorrect because the
inducement to commit a crime must be
from a government agent - not a pri 
vate party, as here. D is also legally in 
correct because evil motives are not a
requirement for conviction of crimes.

97. A is the correct answer. Necessity, or
"choice of evils," is a defense when a
criminal act is performed, so as to avoid
a greater harm to the perpetrator. Al 
though, here, there may not have been
a legitimate necessity, of the given
choices, it is the best. B is incorrect
because Duress is only relevant when
one performs a crime at the imminent
threat of another. Both choices C and
D are incorrect because neither are de 
fenses at Criminal law.

98. C is the correct answer. Forcible Entry
requires there be force used in the tres 
pass. No force was evident here. A is
incorrect for the same reason that C is
correct. B is incorrect because the guilt
of the victim is not a criminal law de 
fense. D is legally incorrect - this was
a crime at common law.

99. A is the correct answer. On the facts
given, it appeared that in no way was
Dick attempting a burglary, arson or a
crime against Marcia's person. Thus,
Marcia utilized deadly force just to pro 
tect her property. The criminal law does
not allow this. [Note: The mere threat
of physical force is, however, allowed.]
B is a correct statement, but choice A is
a better answer, because it is more spe 
cific - it gives the legal reason. C is in 
correct for the same reasons that A is
correct - Marcia was not defending her
habitation. D is incorrect because the
guilt of the victim does not allow an
excessive use of force against that vic 
tim.

CRIMINAL LAW III

END OF ANSWERS

100. B is the best answer. The question did
not ask for reasons; instead it asked for
"affirmative defenses." Of the choices
given, only B is a true affirmative de 
fense. Moreover, B is a fairly good
choice, because one is permitted to do
an otherwise criminal act to avoid a
greater harm. Here, Marcia's deadly
assault was averted by Dick. Although
Dick ordinarily would have had no
right to take her gun, under these cir 
cumstances, it was acceptable. The
weakness with Dick's position is that
he was trespassing - and Necessity re 
quires substantial "innocence" on the
part of the defendant. It should also be
noted that Necessity requires ceasing
the necessary criminal ("evil") act, as
soon as the necessity ceases. In throw 
ing the gun in Marcia's garbage pail
and fleeing, Dick met most, if not all,
of the requirements of Necessity. A
offers an element of Self-Defense- but
it does not state that such is the rel 
evant defense. Therefore, B is a better
answer. Moreover, Self-Defense may
not be available - since Dick's pres 
ence was illegal (i.e., he was not "in 
nocent" as required by Self-Defense).
C is a correct statement, which dis 
proves the last element of robbery.
However, it has nothing to say about
the battery - and most importantly, it
is not an "affirmative defense" - as the
call of the question demands. D is in 
correct because, not only is Diminished
Capacity not a true affirmative defense;
it is also incorrect because no facts
whatsoever indicate that Dick's men 
tal clarity was significantly impaired.

the property. Stan complains that the gas
released by the refinery sometimes makes
him nauseous.

1. If Stan sues oil company over the gas,
his best theory of recovery will be for:

B. Dismiss the action, because a
private citizen never has stand-
ing to sue over a public nuisance.

C. Allow the action, because Stan

is a resident of the area. 

D. Allow the action, because Stan

is lessee of the land.

3. Oil Company's best defense to a suit
by Stan to enjoin the refinery's opera-
tion is:

A. Stan moved to the nuisance and,

thus, cannot complain.

B. The refinery is a social necessity,
which is operated in a proper
place and in a proper manner.

C. No one else has ever complained

A. Strict liability for abnormally

B. Private nuisance.

C. Public nuisance.

D. Negligence.

2. If Stan sues Oil Company and Oil Com-
pany challenges Stan's standing to sue,

Questions 4 - 5 are based on the
following facts:

Stockbroker was responsible for the portfo 
lio of Aaron, a personal friend. Stockbroker
believed that shares in Micra Company
would be a good investment for Aaron. In
his enthusiasm to convince Aaron to pur 
chase Micra Company shares, Stockbroker
told Aaron that the stock was a good buy
because Micra had received an unannounced
major government contract. Stockbroker
knew this statement was untrue when he
made it. Aaron purchased 100 shares of stock

Micra Company is now insolvent.

4.

IfAaron sues Stockbroker for common
law deceit:

Stockbroker's best defense to a suit by
Aaron for common law deceit based on
Stockbroker's statement would be:

A. That Stockbroker acted in good
faith when he made the state 
ment.

B. That Aaron was going to pur

D. That the insolvency of Micra
Company was not reasonably
foreseeable when he made the
statement.

A. Aaron will recover, even though
Stockbroker had his best inter 
est in mind when he made the
statement about Micra Company.

B. Aaron will recover, because
Stockbroker's negligence caused
Aaron's actual injury.

C. Aaron will not recover, because
the malicious intent element re 
quired for common law deceit is
absent.

D. Aaron will not recover, because

Questions 6 — 7 are based on the
following facts: 

In the course of conducting an audit for
Brown Company, Accountant carelessly
computed asset totals. As a result, the audit
report stated that Brown Company was sub-

A. Federal Bank will not recover
because Accountant did not owe
a duty of care to Federal Bank.

B. Federal Bank will not recover,

A. Rhonda will have no cause of
action for common law deceit,
since the element of a false state 
ment of fact has not been met.

B. Rhonda will have no cause of

could have discovered the defect.

C. Rhonda will have a cause of ac 
tion, since active concealment
constitutes common law deceit.

D. Rhonda will not have a cause of
action for deceit because of the
"as is" clause.

Questions 8 - 9 are based on the
following facts:

Rhonda went to Clay's Cars to purchase a
used car. Clay's salesman, Harry, showed
Rhonda a 1985 Crevet. Harry stated that the
Crevet was "a honey of a car, a one of a kind
steal for the money." Rhonda relied on
Harry's statements and purchased the vehicle
from Clay's Cars "as is." The Crevet's en 
gine failed soon after Rhonda purchased it.

8.

If Rhonda sues Clay's Cars for common
law deceit, the result will be:

A. Rhonda will recover because

without permission to shoot geese. In an ef-
fort to discourage hunters, she posted large
"no trespassing" signs in conspicuous places
along the property's boundary. She also dug
a number of deep holes, which she covered
with brush to catch any intruders.  

Calvin, a local land surveyor, was retained
to survey the parcel of land adjoining
Eunice's. While conducting the survey,
Calvin inadvertently walked onto Eunice's
property. He fell into one of the holes and
was seriously injured.

ing cause of Alfred's injuries.

C. The acts of an intentional tort 
feasor always break the chain of
causation.

D. Sherry's liability insurance
policy does not cover injuries
committed by a negligent car
thief.

injuries were suffered while Pe 
ter was stealing the car.

B. Peter will be liable, if he failed
to exercise the care expected of
a reasonable, prudent twelve 
year-old when he drove the car.

C. Peter will be liable, if he failed
to exercise the care expected of
a reasonable, prudent person
when he drove the car.

D. Peter will not be liable because
a twelve-year-old does not have
the capacity to be negligent.

Questions 21 - 23 are based on the
following facts:

The State of Columbia has a statute that
makes it a misdemeanor to leave the key in
the ignition of an unattended motor vehicle.
Sherry needed to pick up a dress at the dry
cleaners and left her unattended car idling
while she ran into the store. Peter, a
twelve-year-old boy, jumped into the car, put
it in gear, and drove away. Within a mile of
the dry cleaners, Peter lost control of the
vehicle. The car jumped the curb and struck
Alfred, a pedestrian. Alfred suffered exten 
sive injuries.

21.

In a negligence suit against Sherry, if

curve. In a special verdict, the jury
found John to be 75% responsible for
Glenda's injuries and State Highway
Department 25% responsible. State
Highway Department is not immune
from a damages judgment.

In a state that follows cornmon law prin 
ciples, if John is insolvent:

A. Dieter will recover because he
was within the zone of danger.

B. Dieter will not recover because
he did not sustain a physical im 
pact.

c. Dieter will not recover because
he is not closely related to Sue.

D. Dieter will not recover because
his injuries were not reasonably

following facts:

Miller recently purchased a lOG-acre farm
in the State of Columbia. Power Company
has an easement across Miller's property,
which includes the authority to trim trees that
might interfere with Power Company's elec 
trical lines. Denton, an employee of Power
Company, entered Miller's property to check
the electrical lines. Denton fell into an aban 
doned well and suffered numerous injuries.
The well had been over grown with brush,

Questions 28 - 29 are based on the
following facts:

Arlen was driving his van on Route 12 when
he noticed he was running out of gas. He
stopped and parked the van on the shoulder
of the highway. The van's rear bumper ex 
tended one-half foot into the highway. Betty,
who was driving an automobile in the same
direction on Route 12, approached Arlen's
van from the rear. Betty was traveling at an
excessive rate of speed and was not paying
attention to her driving. Betty's vehicle
struck the rear of Arlen's van and he was
severely injured.

Arlen sued Betty for negligence. The jury
returned a special verdict, wherein it found
that Betty was 95% responsible for the acci 
dent, while Arlen was 5% at fault in failing
to park his van entirely off the highway. The
jury also found that Arlen's total damages
were $100,000.

28.

In a jurisdiction that has not adopted
comparative fault and still follows com 
mon law principles, Arlen will:

A. Recover $100,000 from Betty.

B. Recover $95,000 from Betty.

C. Not recover anything from Betty
because Arlen was contributorily
negligent.

D. Not recover anything from Betty
because Arlen assumed the risk.

29.

In a jurisdiction that has not adopted
comparative fault and still follows com 
mon law principles, if Arlen can show
that Betty had the "last clear chance"
to avoid the accident, the result will be:

A. Arlen will recover $100,000

from Betty.

B. Arlen will recover $95,000 from

Betty.

C. Arlen will recover nothing from

Betty.

D. None of the above.

shall be diminished in proportion to the
amount of negligence attributable to the
injured party." Tom and Wanda were
involved in an automobile accident, in
which Wanda sustained personal injury
damages totaling $100,000. The jury
returned a special verdict wherein it

Marvin was dissatisfied with his facial fea 
tures, especially the large "bags" under his
eyes. He finally decided to consider elec 
tive plastic surgery. Marvin visited the of 
fice of Doctor, a certified licensed plastic
surgeon. Doctor advised Marvin that if he
surgically removed the bags, Marvin would
"look years younger." Marvin agreed to un 
dergo the surgery, at Doctor's office as an
out-patient.

Doctor administered a general anesthetic and
performed the surgery around Marvin's eyes.
While Marvin was still unconscious, Doc 
tor decided to remove a mole on Marvin's
chin that Doctor thought was unsightly.
When Marvin awoke, he found that he had
no sensation on the left side of his face. He
was also upset to learn that Doctor had re 
moved the mole.

51.

If Marvin sues Doctor for removing the
mole:

A. Marvin will not recover, so long
as Doctor performed the surgery
as would a reasonable, prudent
plastic surgeon.

B. Marvin will not recover because
he impliedly consented to
Doctor's removal of the mole.

C. Marvin will recover because
Doctor has committed the tort of
battery.

D. Marvin will recover because

Doctor was negligent.

52. If Marvin contends that Doctor was re 
sponsible for Marvin's loss of sensation
in his face, the likely outcome will be:

A. Marvin will recover, if he can
show that Doctor had exclusive
control of his person during the
surgery and that the injury suf 
fered usually would not occur in
the absence of negligence.

B. Marvin will recover because a
surgeon is always responsible for
a patient's injuries during sur 
gery.

C. Marvin will not recover, unless
a percipient witness testifies that
Doctor's negligence was the
cause in fact of the injury.

D. None of the above.

53. The standard of care that the court
should apply in Marvin's negligence
action against Doctor is that of:

A. The reasonable, prudent physi 

cian.

B. The reasonable, prudent plastic
surgeon in Doctor's locality.

C. The reasonable, prudent plastic
surgeon as determined by na 
tional standards.

D. The reasonable, prudent plastic
surgeon with education and ex 
perience similar to Doctor's.

54. Assume, for purposes of this question
only, that Marvin's loss of sensation in
his face resulted from the operation
around his eyes, but that Doctor was not
negligent in performing the surgery. In
a suit by Marvin against Doctor:

A. Marvin will recover because a
surgeon is responsible for all in 
juries a patient sustains during an
operation.

B. Marvin will recover under a neg 
ligence theory, if Doctor failed
to inform him that loss of facial
sensation is a common side ef

Questions 55 - 57 are based on the
following facts:

Nancy owns a collection agency. She prides
herself on collecting debts where other col 
lection agencies have failed. Nancy at 
tempted to collect a debt that Darren owed
one of her clients. She made numerous tele 
phone calls to Darren's home between the
hours of 11:00 P.M. and 6:00 AM., to in 
duce him to pay the debt. She continued this
practice for over two months. Finally, Nancy
visited Darren's home and told him in the
presence of his wife, Anne, that Darren
would suffer "serious consequences to his
health" if he did not pay the debt within 24
hours. Darren paid the debt later that day.

Darren and Anne claim that Nancy's collec 
tion tactics caused them serious emotional
disturbance. Both are being treated by psy 
chologists and wish to recover from Nancy
for their mental distress and doctor bills.

55. Darren is most likely to recover from
Nancy for his injuries under which of
the following theories:

A Intentional infliction of emo 

A Anne will not recover because
Nancy had no intent to cause her
emotional distress.

B. Anne will recover because the
doctrine of transferred intent ap 
plies.

c. Anne will not recover because
she has not suffered pecuniary
loss.

D. Anne will recover, if she can
show that Nancy should have
reasonably foreseen that Anne
would suffer emotional distress.

57. To recover for intentional infliction of
emotional distress, most jurisdictions
require a plaintiff to prove, in addition
to an intentional and outrageous act, that
the act has caused:

A Plaintiff a physical impact that
caused the emotional distress.

B. Plaintiff physical consequences
from the emotional distress.

Questions 58 - 60 are based on the
following facts:

D. Sets the duty of care under the
theory of res ipsa loquitur.

Nellie operates a restaurant in a part of the
city that is notorious as a high-crime area.
The restaurant opens every day at 11 :00
AM. and closes at midnight. Customers park
their automobiles in a lot, which Nellie owns,
that is adjacent to the restaurant. A city ordi 
nance requires that each restaurant owner
maintain a parking facility that "is continu 
ously lighted for the hours beginning with
dusk and ending one hour after said restau 
rant has closed for business."

One evening, Nellie's parking lot lighting
system malfunctioned and failed to operate.
Otis, a customer, was beaten and robbed in
the lot by an unknown assailant at 10:00 P.M.
This was the first time that anyone had been
the victim of a crime in the lot. The same
evening, Willard, an intoxicated customer,
fainted in the parking lot and struck his head
on a parking space divider that was not vis 
ible in the darkness.

58. If Otis and Willard sue Nellie for negli 
gence, the judge should instruct the jury
that the city ordinance:

A Establishes the duty of care.

B.

Is a factor that the jury can ac 
cept or reject when it determines
the duty of care.

C.

Is of no relevance in establish 
ing the duty of care.

59. Assume, for this question, that Nellie
breached her duty of care by failing to
keep the parking lot lighted. If Otis sues
Nellie in negligence for injuries caused
by the robber:

A Nellie should prevail because the
intentional act of a felon is al 
ways a superseding cause.

B . Nellie should prevail because no
one had ever been beaten or
robbed in her parking lot before.

C. Otis should prevail if, given the
fact that Nellie's establishment is
in a high-crime area, he can
prove that it was reasonably fore 
seeable that he might be robbed
in the unlighted parking lot.

D. Otis should prevail because the
owner of a restaurant owes a
higher duty of care to a patron
that results in strict liability.

60. Assume, for this question, that Nellie
breached her duty of care by failing to
keep the parking lot lighted. If Willard
sues Nellie for injuries he suffered in
his fall:

A Willard will prevail, because
Nellie was negligent per se.

lQiIS III

B. Willard will prevail because his
fall was a reasonably foreseeable
result of Nellie's negligence.

C. Nellie will prevail because her
breach of the duty of care was
not the cause in fact of Willard's
injury.

D. Nellie will prevail because
Willard had the last clear chance
of preventing the injury.

Questions 61 - 63 are based on the
following facts:

Irene was a passenger in Hank's automobile.
As Hank drove the car through the moun 
tains, a heavy snow storm suddenly came
up. Hank, who was driving too fast for the
conditions, failed to see a tractor trailer that
was blocking the road. Trucker, the owner
of the tractor trailer, had stopped his vehicle
to install snow chains, but had carelessly
failed to pull off the road. Hank was unable
to stop his car and it struck the tractor trailer.
Irene was injured in the accident.

61.

IfIrene sues Hank and Trucker in neg 
ligence to recover damages for her in 
juries:

A. Irene will recover only those
damages which she can prove
each defendant caused.

B. Hank and Trucker will each be
liable to Irene for the full amount
of her damages.

C. Hank and Trucker will each be
liable for fifty percent of Irene's
damages.

D. Irene will recover nothing be 
cause she assumed the risk.

62. Assume, for this question, that a jury
determined that Hank and Trucker were
both responsible for Irene's damages
and that Hank paid Irene the full
amount. Hank's best recourse against
Trucker would be under the theory of:

ElUilS

A. Satisfaction.

B.

Indemnification.

C. Release.

D. Contribution.

63. Assume, for this question, that Hank's
negligence was the sole cause of the
accident and that the jurisdiction has an
automobile guest statute. If Irene sues
Hank for damages:

A. Irene will recover because Hank

was negligent.

Questions 64 - 65 are based on the
following facts:

Paul was a member of a professional base 
ball team that was involved in a heated com 
petition for the league championship. His
team was playing its arch rival in an impor 
tant late-season game. With his team down
by one run with one out in the final inning,
Paul was on first base. When a ground ball
was hit to the second baseman, Paul decided
he would "break up" a potential double play
by making a hard, but legal, slide into Tom,
the shortstop. Paul prevented the double
play, but also broke Tom's ankle in the pro 
cess.

B.

C.

Irene will recover only if she can
show Hank's conduct amounted
to gross negligence.

64.

If Tom sues Paul for the injury to his
ankle, his most likely cause of action
will be for:

Irene will recover only if she can
show Hank's conduct amounted
to an intentional act.

A. Assault.

B. Battery.

D. Irene will recover nothing.

C.

Intentional infliction of emo 
tional distress.

D. Strict liability.

65. Paul's best defense to Tom's suit for

injury to his ankle would be:

A. Contributory negligence.

B. Justification.

C.

Implied consent.

D. Private necessity.

Questions 66 - 69 are based on the
following facts:

Scott owns a furniture store in the town of
Smallville. Scott advertises his location by
means of a large neon sign attached to the
building. The sign, which extends out over
a public sidewalk approximately 15 feet
from the ground, is anchored by two large
cables.

Scott had not checked the condition of the
cables in years, so he was unaware that they
were severely corroded. During an unusu 
ally violent windstorm, the cables broke and
the sign fell, striking Pam, a pedestrian. Pam,
who suffers from a rare bone disease, suf 
fered injuries much more severe than would
the average person when the sign struck her.

66. At common law, most courts would

classify Pam as:

A. A trespasser.

B. A licensee.

C. An invitee.

D. None of the above.

67. If Pam sues Scott in negligence for her
injuries, a court will likely find that
Scott:

A. Had a duty of care to keep the

cables in good repair.

B. Had a duty of care to warn Pam
only of known, latent defects.

C. Had a duty of care to warn Pam
only of dangerous active opera 
tions on his property.

D. Had no duty of care to Pam.

68. The effect of the unusually violent
windstorm on Pam's negligence suit
will likely be to:

A. Prevent Pam from recovering
from Scott, because the storm
was an intervening act of God.

B. Prevent Pam from recovering
from Scott, because a violent
storm is not a reasonably fore 
seeable event.

C. Not adversely affect Pam's suit,
as a defendant is liable for all
injuries directly caused by him.

D. Not adversely affect Pam's suit,
because the storm was a reason 
ably foreseeable intervening act
of God.

69. Assume, for this question, that Scott's
negligence caused the sign to strike
Pam. Pam will be able to recover:

A. Only those damages which Scott
could have reasonably foreseen
under the circumstances.

B. Only those damages which an
ordinary person would have suf-
fered, because Scott is not re-
sponsible for Pam's preexisting
condition.

C. All damages sustained in the ac-
cident, even though Pam has a
rare bone disease that makes her
more susceptible to injury.

D. None of the above.

Questions 70 — 74 are based on the
following facts:

Grover, a civilian employee of the United
States Army, was responsible for delivering
packages between military bases. He drove
a small government-owned van when mak-
ing his deliveries. One day, Grover was driv-
ing on a public highway and, because he was
careless, he lost control of the van. The ve-
hicle jumped the curb and struck Inge, a pe-
destrian.   

Inge was seriously injured in the accident.
She lingered in the hospital for almost two
months before she died of her injuries. Inge
is survived by her husband and two minor
children.

70. At common law, if Inge's estate sued
Grover to recover for medical expenses
incurred between the date of the acci-
dent and the date of her death, the re-
sult would be:

A. Inge's estate would recover
medical expenses in a wrongful
death action.

B. Inge's estate would recover
medical expenses in a survival
action.

C. Inge's estate would recover noth-
ing because her right of action
against Grover ended with her
death.

D. None of the above.

TaTTS 245

71.

In most states today, ifInge's husband
and minor children wish to recover for
lost financial support, services, and so 
ciety suffered as a result of her death,
their claim against Grover will be:

B. Grover's actions were a super 

seding cause.

C. Grover was engaged in a frolic

and detour.

A. A wrongful death action.

D. The Army's duty was non 

delegable.

B. A survival action.

C. A negligent infliction of emo 

tional distress action.

D. A simple negligence action.

74. Assume, for this question, that Grover
was negligent and that the Army was
vicariously liable. If the Army raises the
defense of sovereign immunity, the re 
sult will be:

A. The Army will be liable because
sovereign immunity violates the
Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.

B. The Army will be liable because
Congress waived sovereign im 
munity in negligence cases
through the Federal Tort Claims
Act.

C. The Army will be liable because
agencies of the United States
government have never enjoyed
sovereign immunity.

D. The Army will not be liable.

72. Assume, for this question, that Inge's
husband and children have a valid neg 
ligence claim against Grover. If they
wish to hold the Army responsible for
Grover's negligence, they should raise
the doctrine of:

A. Negligent hiring.

B. Respondeat superior.

C. Nondelegable duty.

D. Independent contractor.

73. Assume, for this question, that, at the
time of the accident, Grover was on a
personal errand totally unrelated to
Army business. If Inge's husband and
children sue the Army for Grover's neg 
ligence, the Army's best defense will
be:

A. Grover was acting within the

scope of his employment.

Questions 75 - 77 are based on the
following facts:

The Smalltown Sentinel is a local weekly
newspaper. Each issue includes a column
detailing births, deaths, marriages and other
events of interest in the community. In a re 
cent issue, the Sentinel ran an item stating:
"Local resident Sally Smith, age 21, gave
birth to twins last week." There is one
Smalltown resident named Sally Smith and
she is 21, but she is not married and has never
had a child. Smith suffered ridicule and
embarrassment because of the news item.
When informed of its mistake, the Sentinel
printed a retraction and apology.

75. At common law, if Sally Smith sued the
Sentinel for libel based on the news
item:

A. She would recover because the

statement is libel per se.

B. She would not recover because
there has been no publication.

A. Her suit would fail because libel
required malicious intent at com 
mon law.

B. Her suit would fail because libel
required at least reckless conduct
at common law.

C. Her suit would fail because libel
required at least negligence at
common law.

D. Her suit would succeed.

77. Assume, for this question, that Sally
Smith has proven a prima facie case for
libel. The effect of the Sentinel's retrac 
tion and apology would be:

A. To limit damages the Sentinel
must pay, because of the mitiga 
tion rule.

B. To limit damages the Sentinel
must pay, because of the collat 
eral source rule.

C. She would not recover because
she has not established the col 
loquium.

C. To limit damages the Sentinel
must pay, because of the offset 
ting benefit rule.

D. She would recover, so long as
she produced sufficient evidence
to show reasonable innuendo.

D. To prevent Sally Smith from re 
covering any damages from the
Sentinel.

76. If the Sentinel can prove that the item
was published as a result of an inno 
cent mistake, at common law the effect
on Sally Smith's libel suit would be:

Questions 78 - 81 are based on the
following facts:

79. If Linda brings a defamation action

against Cleo, the result will be:

Roman is the host of a nationally-syndicated
radio show. Roman is very controversial and
specializes in exposing unsavory details
about the lives of politicians and celebrities.
Roman decided to exploit his notoriety by
marketing a series of cassette tapes entitled,
"Lifestyles of the Sick and Sleazy." The in 
formation on the tapes had never been re 
vealed or published before. The tapes were
distributed to bookstores nationwide for sale.
Cleo, a bookseller, sold a number of the tapes
but never listened to them himself.

On one of the tapes, Roman alleged that
Linda, a United States Senator, had worked
as a dancer in a topless bar while in college.
Roman heard this "rumor" from an
ex-convict with a very poor reputation for
the truth, but he did no further investigation
before recording the story. In fact, the story
was a complete fabrication. Linda, a very
conservative individual, was distressed and
embarrassed when she learned of the story.

78. Modernly, if Linda sues Roman for
defamation, the most appropriate cause
of action would be:

A. Slander.

B. Libel.

C. Slander per se.

D. Libel per quod.

A. Cleo will be liable for republish-
ing the defamatory statement.

B. Cleo will be vicariously liable.

C. Cleo will not be liable because
he is a secondary publisher.

D. Cleo will be liable, but he may
have indemnification from Ro-
man.

80.

If Linda sues Roman for libel, the rul-
ings of the United States Supreme Court
require that she must prove:

A. "Actual malice," meaning that
Roman acted willfully and wan-
tonly in publishing the de-
famatory statement.

B. "Actual malice," meaning that
Roman acted with knowledge
that the defamatory statement
was false or with reckless disre-
gard for the truth.

C. Roman was at least negligent and
she suffered "actual injury."

D. Roman intended to make the

defamatory statement.

8!. Under rulings of the United States Su-
preme Court, Linda's burden of proof
in her libel action against Roman is:

A. Preponderance of the evidence.

B. Clear and convincing evidence.

C. Beyond a reasonable doubt.

D. None of the above.

Questions 82 — 85 are based on the
following facts:

Harriet and Jenny were once general part-
ners in the same law firm. Harriet and Jenny
had numerous disagreements which led them
to dissolve the firm. After the breakup,
Harriet learned that Jenny was telling other
lawyers that Harriet was facing disciplinary
action by the state bar for commingling cli-
ent trust fund monies with her personal as-
sets. This allegation was untrue in all re-
spects. She also learned that Jenny told other
acquaintances that Harriet "was a real clown,
who wouldn't recognize a lawbook if one
fell on her head."   

82. At common law, if Harriet sues Jenny
for defamation with respect to the state-
ments about commingling client trust
funds, the appropriate cause of action
would be:

A. Slander per se.

B. Slander per quod.

C. Simple slander.

D. Intentional interference with pro-
spective business advantage.

83. Modernly, if Harriet sues Jenny for
defamation with respect to the state-
ment about her being a clown, the likely
result would be:

TORTS 249

D. One is never liable for damages
for statements made on the wit

85. Assume, for this question, that Aaron,
a courtroom spectator, heard Jenny's
false statement on the witness stand.
When Aaron returned to his office, he
repeated Jenny's statements to Clyde,
a co-worker, but Clyde did not believe
the statement. If Harriet sues Aaron for
defamation, the result will be:

A. Aaron will prevail because he is
protected by the reporter's privi 
lege.

B. Harriet will prevail because
Aaron has republished the de 
famatory statement.

C. Harriet will prevail because
Aaron has exceeded the scope of
his conditional privilege.

D. Aaron will prevail because Clyde
did not believe the statement.

A. Harriet will not recover because
the statement is Jenny's opinion
and all opinions are constitution 
ally protected under the Gertz v.
Welch decision.

B. Harriet will not recover because
lawyers are always public figures
under New York Times v.
Sullivan.

C. Harriet will not recover because
Jenny's statement is an opinion
that does not appear to be
founded on underlying false
facts.

D. Harriet will recover.

84. Assume, for this question, that Harriet
sued Jenny for defamation and that dur 
ing the trial Jenny falsely stated on the
witness stand that Harriet had com 
mingled client funds with her personal
assets on other occasions. If Harriet sues
Jenny for defamation for the in-court
false statement, Jenny's best defense
will be:

A. Harriet assumed the risk of the
in-court statement when she filed
the first suit.

B. Jenny's statement is protected by

a conditional privilege.

C. Jenny's statement is protected by

an absolute privilege.

Questions 86 - 88 are based on the
following facts:

Snowco is a manufacturer of snowmobiles.
Ski-Fun, an independent retailer, sells a num 
ber of snowmobiles from Snowco's line.
Marlene purchased a Snowco snowmobile
from Ski-Fun. The very first time she oper 
ated the vehicle, the steering mechanism
malfunctioned, causing the snowmobile to
overturn. The snowmobile struck Harold, a
bystander. Marlene and Harold both suffered
serious injuries. Accident investigators de 
termined that a critical bolt in the steering
mechanism was missing and that the acci 
dent resulted from this defect.

86.

If Marlene sues Snowco for injuries
suffered in the accident, the likely re 
sult will be:

A. Marlene will not recover because
she is not in privity of contract
with Snowco.

B. Marlene will not recover, unless
she can prove Snowco was neg 
ligent.

C. Marlene will recover, under a
strict liability in tort theory, be 
cause Snowco is responsible for
the design defect.

D. Marlene will recover, under a
strict liability in tort theory, be 
cause Snowco is responsible for
the manufacturing defect.

87. Assume, for this question, that Ski-Fun
did not inspect the snowmobile's steer 
ing mechanism before it sold the vehicle
to Marlene. If Harold sues Ski-Fun for
his injuries under a strict liability in tort
theory, in most jurisdictions today:

A. Harold will not recover because
Ski-Fun did not cause the manu 
facturing defect.

B. Harold will recover, so long as
he was a reasonably foreseeable
bystander.

C. Harold will not recover because
in privity with

he was not
Ski-Fun or Snowco.

D. Harold will recover, but only if
he was related to Marlene.

88. Which of the following statements
would constitute Snowco's best defense
to a strict liability in tort action by
Marlene?

A. The evidence

shows

that
Marlene tampered with the steer 
ing mechanism before she drove
the snowmobile.

B. A snowmobile is an inherently
dangerous instrument, and
Marlene assumed the risk when
she operated it.

C. Marlene had never driven a
snowmobile before the accident.

D. In the snowmobile industry,
Snowco has the most elaborate
quality control checks during the
manufacturing process.

Questions 89 - 90 are based on the
following facts:

Moribundia is a rare tropical disease that
causes death to 98% of humans who con 
tract it. There has been no known cure for
the disease. Recently, Pharmco developed a
new drug to counteract Moribundia. Labo 
ratory tests revealed, however, that a side
effect of the drug is deafness in 1% of pa 
tients who were treated with the medication.
Despite diligent efforts, Pharmo's scientists
have been unable to eliminate the deafness
side effect associated with the drug. Elmer
contracted Moribundia and his physician
prescribed Pharmco's new drug. While the
drug saved Elmer's life, it also left him pro 
foundly deaf.

89. If Elmer sues Pharmco under a strict
liability in tort theory for his deafness,
the likely result will be:

A. Elmer will recover because
Pharmco is responsible for the
manufacturing defect.

B. Elmer will recover because
Pharmco is responsible for the
design defect.

C. Elmer will not recover because
the drug was unavoidably un 
safe.

D. Elmer will not recover because
drug manufacturers are exempt
from strict liability rules.

90. Assume,

for

this question,

that
Pharmco's new drug is available only
by prescription and that the package
contains a conspicuous warning of the
possible deafness side-effect. Assume,
also, that Elmer's doctor administered
the drug, but that he failed to tell Elmer
of the risk of deafness. If Elmer sues
Pharmco under a strict liability in tort
theory for his deafness, the result will
be:

A. Elmer will recover because
Pharmco failed to warn him of
the deafness side effect.

B. Elmer will recover because
Pharmco is responsible for all
personal injuries caused by its
drug.

C. Elmer will not recover because
Pharmco's warning to Elmer's
doctor constitutes a warning to
Elmer.

D. Elmer will not recover because
drug manufacturers are exempt
from strict liability rules.

Questions 91 - 92 are based on the
following facts:

Blaster Co. is a manufacturer of dynamite,
nitroglycerin and other volatile products.
The management at Blaster Co. takes pride
in its excellent safety record. It runs a state 
of-the-art training program for employees,
and constantly demands that employees act
with the utmost care. Careless employees are
summarily dismissed.

Rudy, a Blaster Co. employee, carelessly left
a container of liquid nitroglycerin in the aisle
of an unlighted section of Blaster Co. 's ware 
house. Susan, an inspector from the state
Department of Safety, tripped over the con 
tainer. Fortunately, it did not explode, but
Susan broke her arm when she fell.

91.

If Susan sues Blaster Co. for injuries
she suffered when she broke her arm:

A. Blaster Co. should be held
strictly liable because it is en 
gaged in abnormally dangerous
activity.

B. Blaster Co. should be held liable
because its employee was negli 
gent.

C. Blaster Co. should not be liable
because the injury was not rea 
sonably foreseeable.

D. Blaster Co. should not be liable
because Susan's injury is cov 
ered by worker's compensation.

TCJiIS EJ

92. Blaster Co. 's safety controls and its
policy of summarily dismissing care 
less employees will:

A. Prevent Susan from recovering
from Blaster Co., because Rudy
was engaged in a frolic and de

B. Prevent Susan from recovering
from Blaster Co., because Rudy
was acting beyond the scope of
his employment.

Questions 93 - 94 are based on the
following facts:

Arlene purchased a toaster which was manu 
factured by Crispco. The first time she used
the toaster, a wire shorted and caused a fire.
Arlene's kitchen was destroyed and she re 
ceived minor burns in attempting to extin 
guish the blaze. An investigation revealed
that the type of wire in question, which was
used in all Crispco toasters, was inadequate
to safely conduct normal household electri 
cal current.

C. Not prevent Susan from recov

ering from Rudy only.

IfArlene sues Crispco for injuries to her
kitchen and person, the most appropri 
ate cause of action would be:

D. Not prevent Susan from recov 
ering from both Rudy and
Blaster Co.

A. A suit for strict liability in tort,
because the toaster had a manu 
facturing defect.

B. A suit for strict liability in tort,
because the toaster had a design
defect.

C. A suit for strict liability in tort,
because Crispco failed to warn
of the danger.

D. A negligence action, provided
Arlene can show that Crispco
and she were in privity.

94. Assume, for this question, that the in 
adequate wire caused the toaster to be
destroyed, but that Arlene and her
kitchen were not harmed. IfArlene sues
Crispco in tort to recover the cost of a
replacement toaster, the result will be:

A. Arlene will recover because the
toaster had a manufacturing de-
fect.

B. Arlene will recover because the
toaster had a design defect.

C. Arlene will recover because
Crispco breached its implied
warranty of merchantability.

D. Arlene will not recover.

ballet so that she would not miss the first
act. Don died from loss of blood. He left a
wife and two minor children.   

95. If Don's wife and children sue Sandra

for wrongful death:

A. They will recover because a phy-

tan statute:

A. They will recover because
Sandra undertook a duty and per 
formed it negligently.

B. They will recover because Good

97. If Randolph sues Anna for damages, in
most jurisdictions, his cause of action
would be called a suit for:

A. Wrongful birth.

B. Wrongful life.

C. Wrongful death.

and Clara would have given birth
to Randolph anyway.

C. Anna could not have reasonably
foreseen the extent of Ran 
dolph's medical and educational
expenses.

D. Clara signed a form agreeing not
to sue Anna for negligence.

I and II only.

D. I, II and III.

100. Clancy retained Wanda, an attorney, to
write his will. They entered into a stan 
dard written attorney-client contract
and Clancy paid the fee Wanda
charged. Clancy instructed Wanda that
he wished to leave his real property to
Fred, his favorite nephew. Wanda pre 
pared the will, but carelessly over 
looked a relevant section of the Pro 
bate Act.

When Clancy died and the will was
offered for probate, Fred and the other
heirs learned of Wanda's error. As a
direct result of the error, the devise to
Fred was adeemed and Fred received
nothing from Clancy's estate.

If Fred sues Wanda for professional
negligence in the preparation of
Clancy's will, in most jurisdictions to 
day the likely outcome will be:

A. Fred will not recover because he
was not in privity of contract
with Wanda.

B. Fred will not recover because an
attorney does not owe a duty of
care to anyone but his client.

C. Fred will recover because he is a
third party beneficiary of the
contract between Wanda and
Clancy.

D. Fred will recover, but his dam 
ages will be limited to the fee
Clancy paid Wanda.

Questions 101 -104 are based on
the following facts:

Peter was driving his Tetra car down the
highway at the legal speed limit when traf 
fic suddenly stopped ahead of him. Because
he was driving cautiously, Peter was able to
come to a smooth stop about ten feet from
the car ahead of him. Denny was driving
behind Peter and had taken his eyes off of
the road for a second or two to adjust his
radio. During that short period of time that
Denny's attention was distracted, the traffic
stopped and Denny was unable to stop be 
fore hitting Peter's car in the rear. When
Denny hit Peter's car, it was pushed forward
quickly and the back of Peter's head hit the
head rest. The headrest was built of padding
around a central metal core. The metal core
was shaped like the cross section of an air 
plane wing, with a rounded point in front
and a sharper point to the rear, giving the
head rest an aerodynamic shape. As Peter's
head hit the rest, the padding compressed
and allowed the front portion of the metal
core to focus and concentrate the pressure
on the back of Peter's head to a small area,
causing a fracture to his skull and first ver 
tebra. Had the metal core been broader and
flat, it would have spread the pressure over
a wider area and caused no damage to Peter.
Peter is paralyzed from the neck down as a
result. Peter has sued the car maker, Tetra,
under Restatement Torts 2d 402A.

B. The product was defective.

C. That he has privity with the

Manufacturer.

D. He received the product as a re 

sult of a technical sale.

102. On the facts set forth above, the prod 

uct has the following defect:

A. A design defect, because it cre 

ates an avoidable hazard.

B. A manufacturing defect, because

it was made as intended.

C. A marketing defect, because it
was advertised as a safe car.

D. A fabrication defect, because the

core was too thin.

103. The best defense that Tetra could of 

fer is:

A. That this was the first time this

had happened and TetraDwas not
aware of the danger.

B. That the car was sold with a le 
gally effective disclaimer of li 
ability.

C. That Peter was contributorily

the burden of proving:

A. The manufacturer was unreason 

able.

D. That the car was designed to be
driven and wrecking it wasDa
form of misuse.

•

lUi IS

104. Tetra contends that it should only be
liable for the enhanced damages
caused by the defective head rest, and
that Danny should be liable for all
other damages. This argument is:

A. Incorrect because Tetra was a
substantial factor in causing
Peter's damages.

B. Correct because some damage to
Pete would have occurred even
if the head rest was properly de 
signed.

C. Correct, but Tetra has the burden
of apportioning the damages.

D. Correct, and Peter must prove
what portion of his damages
were caused by Tetra in order to
recover.

Questions 105 -109 are based on
the following facts:

Questa Corp manufactured carpets. One of
its carpets was a thick plush, advertised and
promoted mainly as a good carpet for hotels
and motels because of its long wearing quali 
ties. It's trade name was Royal Plush. Prince
Hotel purchased the Royal Plush carpet and
had it installed in the halls and lobby, hav 
ing to close the hotel down in order to rip up
the old carpet and install the new. This job
was accomplished just prior to the opening
of the summer season, a time during which
Prince Hotel could expect full occupancy
and make a good profit. Before reopening,
the hotel had to get a certificate from the
local fire inspector. The fire inspector tested
a sample of the carpet and found it was
highly flammable, so refused to certify the
hotel for occupancy.

Prince Hotel had to remain closed, rip up
the carpet and install new, fire retardant car 
pet, and lost all profits from the first month
of the summer season.

105. If Prince Hotel sues Questa Corp on a
theory of negligence and 402A, it will
probably:

A. Not recover for lost profit, be 

cause this is pure economicDloss.

B. Recover for expense of replac 

ing the carpets.

C. Recover for profits lost while the

hotel was closed.

1mIS Em

D. Both Band C.

106. On these facts the best theory of re 

covery for Prince Hotel is:

A. Negligence.

B. 402A.

C. Express warranty.

B. Prince Hotel was negligent in not
discovering the flammable qual 
ity of the carpet.

C. The arsonist was a superseding

cause of Patricia's injury.

D. Patricia is an unforeseeable
plaintiff and barred underDthe
rule enunciated by Justice
Cardozo in Palsgraff.

D. Implied warranty of merchant 

ability.

108. Patricia seeks to recover the follow 

ing damages:

107. In addition to the above facts, assume
that a fire retardant is available that
would make the Royal Plush carpet
safe at a reasonable cost, and that this
retardant is generally used in the car 
pet industry. Questa made a practice
of not using the fire retardant because
it enabled Questa to make an additional
1% profit on its carpet sales. After the
carpet is installed Prince Hotel opens
to the public and is fully occupied
when a disgruntled employee deliber 
ately starts a fire to express his anger
at the hotel. Patricia, a guest, is se 
verely burned over most of her body
in the fire because of the high flam 
mability of the carpet. She is perma 
nently scarred and disabled as a result.
On these facts, Questa's best defense
in a suit by Patricia would be:

I. Compensation for her

medical expenses.

II. Compensation for her
lost wages and earning
capacity.

III. Compensation for pain

and suffering.

IV. Punitive damages against

Questa.

She will probably recover the follow 
ing:

A. I and II only.

B.

I and III only.

A. Patricia lacks privity and cannot

C.

I, II and III, but not IV.

sue Questa.

D. All four.

1m TailS

109. If Patricia seeks recovery from the ho 
tel by joining it as a party defendant in
her lawsuit against the carpet maker,
her best theory for recovery is:

A. A suit under Rest. Torts 2d 402A.

B. A suit as a business invitee.

C. A suit under Rest. Torts 2d 402B.

D. A suit under some form of war 

ranty.

110. If Patricia obtains a substantial judg 
ment against both Questa and Prince
Hotel, and Prince Hotel satisfies the
judgment, it will be entitled to sue
Questa for:

A. Indemnity.

B. Contribution.

C. Equitable Apportionment.

D. None of the above.

Questions 111 -114 are based on
the following facts:

Ajax Corp made a drug called Alphacin used
to treat Multiple Sclerosis, a degenerative
and usually fatal disease. Alphacin was ef 
fective in treating MS and prevented further
degeneration as long as the drug was taken,
but contained a component part, a compound
called Chlorofin, which caused a deteriora 
tion ofthe optic nerve and consequent blind 
ness in a small percentage of patients who
used the drug over a long period of time.
Ajax marketed the drug from 1980 through
1985, at which time the side effect was dis 
covered. Ajax stopped marketing the drug
after discovering the side effect. Baxter Drug
Co also made a drug call Betacin, used for
the treatment of MS, which also contained
the ingredient Ch10rofin. Chlorofin is the
ingredient in the medication that causes it to
be effective in treating MS. Baxter Drug Co
continued to market Betacin through 1990
without a warning of the side effect, even
though Baxter knew or could have known
of the side effect as early as 1986. In 1991,
Baxter Drug Co began publishing a warn 
ing of the side effect in the Physician's Desk
Reference and also in package inserts.
Pauline had been taking Alphacin through a
prescription from her physician, Dr. Smith,
since 1980. When Alphacin was discontin 
ued in 1985, Dr. Smith began prescribing
Betacin and Pauline continued taking
Betacin until 1993 when she went blind. She
has sued Baxter Drug Co on a theory of strict
products liability under Rest. Torts 2d 402A.

~lsEl

111. On these facts, Pauline will probably
be able to prove that the drug Betacin
marketed by Baxter Drug Co is defec 
tive under a theory of:

A. Manufacturing defect.

B. Design Defect.

C. Warning Defect.

D. She can't prove defectiveness.

112. At trial of the case against Baxter Drug
Co., all the expert witnesses agree that
Pauline would probably have gone
blind from the effects of taking
Alphacin for five years, even if she had
never taken Betacin; they also agree
that Betacin would have caused the
blindness as a result of taking the drug
for more than five years. In attempt 
ing to prove that Baxter Drug Co. 's ac 
tions were the cause in fact of her in 
jury, Pauline must rely on:

A. Pauline had no choice but to take

the drug.

B. The degenerative effect of un 
treated MS was much more se 
vere than the side effect.

C. Pauline would have died from
the disease but for the drug.

D. Dr. Smith's continued prescrib 

ing of the drug shows theDlack of
warning was not the cause of her
injury.

114. If Pauline sues Dr. Smith for prescrib 
ing the drug without warning her, she
may prevail under the following
theory:

A. Negligent failure to obtain her

informed consent.

B. Strict liability of section 402A of

Rest. Torts 2d.

A. The Sine Qua Non test.

C. Breach of implied warranty of

B. The Substantial Factor test.

merchantability.

D. Negligent prescribing of a drug

C. Alternative Liability under Sum 

with side effects.

mers v. Tice.

D. Market Share Liability under the

Sindell case.

113. In order to rebut Pauline's evidence of
actual causation, Baxter Drug Co. may
successfully argue the following:

EB 1CJ'11S

Questions 115 -117 are based on
the following facts:

Pete worked for many years as an installer
of asbestos insulation. He became ill at age
55 and was diagnosed as suffering from As 
bestosis, a disease caused by exposure to
small asbestos spicules that lodge in the
lungs and, after a long incubation period of
10 to 20 years, result in asbestosis. Pete was
never warned of the danger of breathing as 
bestos dust, and had he been warned he could
have worn a simple protective mask to pre 
vent the asbestos spicules from entering his
lungs. Pete is barred from suing his employer
by the worker's compensation act of the
state. He wants to sue the manufacturer of
the asbestos insulation sold to his employer
and installed by the workers, including Pete.
Although the asbestos industry had been
aware of the hazards of asbestos dust and
particles to workers using insulation for
more than 50 years, no warnings had ever
been issued by the asbestos manufacturers.
Pete knows that his employer has purchased
asbestos insulation from Ajax Asbestos Co
during Pete's tenure, and knows also that his
employer has purchased insulation from at
least 10 other manufacturers while Pete
worked there. He is unable to discover the
identity of the other asbestos suppliers.

115. In order to get a complete recovery for
his damages in the case, Pete should
use:

B. The Substantial Factor test for

causation in fact.

C. Alternative liability under Sum 

mers v. Tice.

D. Market Share Liability under the

Sindell case.

116. Ajax Asbestos Co had only been in the
asbestos business for five years and
claims it did not have access to early
studies that showed the danger of as 
bestos to workers installing insulation.
These facts may provide an arguable
defense based on:

A. The State of the Art.

B. The claim that there is no design

defect.

C. Ajax was not the cause in fact of

Pete's injury.

D. All of the above.

117. If Pete sues Ajax for breach of implied
warranty, the best defense available on
these facts for Ajax is:

A. There is no warranty because no

representation concerningDthe
product were made by Ajax.

B. All warranties were disclaimed

A. The Sine qua non test for causa 

by Ajax.

tion in fact.

C. Pete lacks vertical privity.

D. Pete lacks horizontal privity.

lQ11S EI

B. Negligence.

C. Warranty.

D. All of the above.

119. If Patricia sues Jim's Off Road Shoppe
for breach of Express Warranty, Jim's
best defense would be:

A. Jim made no warranty.

B. Patricia lacks vertical privity.

C. Patricia lacks horizontal privity.

D. Patricia can't prove a defect.

120. If Patricia sues Wily Car Co for 402a
and Negligence, the best way she can
prove the vehicle was defective is by
use of:

A. Res Ipsa Loquitor.

B. Her expert's testimony that a
missing spring was the possible
cause of the transmission failure.

C. The fact that it was a new ve 

hicle, she had not damaged itDor
had it serviced improperly.

D. Circumstantial evidence.

Questions 118 -121 are based on
the following facts:

Patricia watched, with interest, a series of
television ads for a vehicle called "the Out 
law" produced by Wily Car Co. These ads
showed the four-wheel drive Outlaw going
up and down extremely steep hills, bounc 
ing over large rocks, and generally giving
the impression that it was a remarkably rug 
ged and powerful machine. Patricia went to
the local dealer for Wily Car Co, Jim's Off
Road Shoppe, and purchased an Outlaw. She
immediately took her new vehicle up into
the rugged mountains near her home and, as
she was driving up a steep dirt road, decided
to put the vehicle into four-wheel drive. The
Outlaw climbed the steep slope in the four
wheel drive, but when Patricia started down
the equally-steep reverse slope, the transmis 
sion did not slow the vehicle down, she lost
control and wrecked the vehicle on a large
boulder at the bottom of the hill. Patricia
miraculously escaped injury. She hired a
mechanical engineer to look at the vehicle,
to determine what happened. Because the
transmission and the linkage were destroyed
in the crash, he was unable to determine if
there was any kind of defect, but he said it
was possible that a spring was not fastened
that would have permitted the transmission
to slip out of gear and free wheel down the
slope, although it would have worked fine
when going up hill.

118. On these facts, Patricia's best chance
for a full recovery would be a suit
based on:

A. Rest. Torts 2d 402A.

121. Just before trial of her case against
Wily Car Co., Patricia discovers that
Wily Car Co. has discontinued using
cast aluminum gear boxes on the Out 
law transmission, and has instead sub 
stituted cast iron gear boxes; a much
stronger material. She wishes to intro 
duce evidence of this fact to the jury.
A motion in limine made by Wily Car
Co. to exclude this evidence will likely
be:

A. Denied, because fault is not at is 

sue.

B. Granted, because the evidence is

irrelevant.

C. Granted, because of the public
policy to encourage safety.

D. Denied, because it shows that
Wily Car Co. has a conscious 
ness of guilt.

TORTSANSWERS

1. B is the correct answer, since a private
nuisance action will protect Stan's right
to use and enjoy his property. A is in 
correct because the facts show that the
gas is harmless. C is incorrect, since the
facts do not state that other members of
the public are affected by the gas. D is
incorrect because there is no statement
that Oil Company was careless.

2. D is the correct answer, since a person
in lawful possession of land has stand 
ing to bring suit to abate a private nui 
sance. A is incorrect because one need
not be an owner to sue for private nui 
sance. B is incorrect, since a private citi 
zen can bring suit to abate a public nui 
sance when he has an injury different
in kind from the general public. C is
incorrect because mere residency in the
area does not confer standing.

3. B is the correct answer. Since an equity
court, when considering whether to
abate a nuisance, will balance the hard 
ships and find that the value of the re 
finery as operated outweighs Stan's
occasional inconvenience. Stan, of
course, can still recover damages. A is
incorrect because coming to the nui 
sance is not a complete defense, but
rather one factor the court will consider
on the abatement issue. C is incorrect
because it is not relevant to Stan's indi 
vidual claim for private nuisance. D is
an incorrect statement of law.

4. A is the correct answer because one who
intentionally deceives another, even for
a good motive, is liable for common law
deceit. B is incorrect, since Stock 
broker's act was intentional, not negli 
gent. C is incorrect because malice is
not an element for common law deceit.
D is incorrect because Aaron was justi 
fied in relying on the statement of a
trusted financial advisor.

5. B is the correct answer because Aaron
must show that he was induced by
Stockbroker's statement when he
bought the stock as an element of com 
mon law deceit. If he intended to pur 
chase the stock anyway, he has not met
this element. A is incorrect because
Stockbroker made a false statement of
fact, even if in good faith. C is incor 
rect because the facts show Aaron has
out-of-pocket damages. D is incorrect
because it is reasonably foreseeable to
a broker that a company might become
insolvent.

6. B is the correct answer, since Account 
ant's carelessness in preparing the au 
dit was a negligent misrepresentation
to one relying on it. A is incorrect be 
cause Accountant did not intend to de 
ceive anyone. C is incorrect becauseAc 
countant was negligent according to the
facts. D is incorrect because B is cor 
rect.

TCJiIS II

10. B is the correct answer, since when one
disparages the product of another
through false statements of fact, a cause
of action for trade libel arises. A is in 
correct, since the honesty and ethical
integrity of Stopco has not been chal 
lenged. C is incorrect, since this tort
does not exist. D is incorrect, as Stopco
has not been injured by relying on any
misrepresentation made to it.

11. C is the correct answer, since the com 
mon law required a trade libel plaintiff
to show special damages in the form of
particular lost customers or profits. A
is not correct because a general loss of
profits is not enough to meet the spe 
cial damages rule. B is incorrect, for
basically the same reason. D is a false
statement of law, as Brakeco's actions
exceed the bounds of legal business
competition.

12. B is the correct answer, since Clay has
misappropriated Grey's image for
Clay's commercial benefit. A is incor 
rect, since there has been no disclosure
of private facts about Grey. C is incor 
rect, since publication of the picture did
not invade on Grey's seclusion. D is
incorrect, since picturing Grey in a
reputable sporting goods ad did not
place him in a false light.

7. A is the correct answer. Under the ma 
jority rule of Ultramares v. Touche, one
making a negligent misrepresentation
is liable only to third parties in situa 
tions approaching privity of contract.
Since Accountant did not know of the
existence of Federal Bank or that it
would be making a loan, the privity-like
requirement is not met. B is incorrect
because Federal Bank did rely on the
audit report. C is incorrect because it
states the minority rule. D is incorrect
because it states a spurious legal prin 
ciple.

8. C is the correct answer because one
cannot justifiably rely on statements of
opinion of quality and value when en 
tering into a contract. A is incorrect,
since Harry did not commit fraud,
Clay's Cars cannot be vicariously liable.
B is an incorrect statement of law. D is
also a plainly incorrect statement oflaw,
as deceit is a tort action and is not based
on contract. Any contractual waiver of
fraud liability would violate public
policy.

9. C is the correct answer, since courts
have long recognized that active con 
cealment constitutes common law de 
ceit. A is incorrect because a false state 
ment is not necessary in concealment
cases. B is incorrect because the con 
cealment was designed to cover the
crack and to discourage Rhonda from
making further inspection. D is in 
correct because an "as is" clause does
not insulate one from liability for fraud.

E~IS

16. D is the correct answer because the
negative covenant is reasonable in geo 
graphical location (the city) and in time
(one year). A is incorrect because a
court will not order a person to perform
a personal services contract. B is in 
correct because an injunction based on
the negative covenant will issue. C is
incorrect because the covenant's terms
are not unreasonable.

17. B is the correct answer because Profes 
sor Smith committed an assault. An ac 
tor is liable for assault if he intends to
cause a harmful or offensive contact,
or creates a reasonable apprehension of
contact, and the victim believes that the
contact is imminent. A is incorrect be 
cause the facts do not show that Logan
and Adam suffered any emotional dis 
tress. C is incorrect because contact is
a requirement for battery, not assault.
D is incorrect because Professor Smith
should have known that his act was sub 
stantially certain to cause an apprehen 
sion of an imminent harmful or offen 
sive contact.

13. C is the correct answer, because Clem 
ent has used an appropriate civil pro 
cess for an unlawful purpose. He is not
merely collecting on a valid judgment,
but is attempting to punish Lake
through his excessive executions. A is
incorrect because Clement had probable
cause to bring the execution and is en 
titled to attach property valued at $100.
B is incorrect because this is not a crimi 
nal case. D is plainly incorrect, as there
has been no conversion.

14. A is the correct answer, since it is not a
prerequisite for an abuse of process ac 
tion that the proceeding be terminated
in plaintiff's favor. B is incorrect be 
cause Lake must show that Clement had
an ulterior motive for his actions. C is
not correct because a plaintiff must
show some damage, be it financial or
otherwise. D is not correct because
abuse of process is an intentional tort.

15. C is the correct answer because the tort
of intentional interference with contrac 
tual relations requires intentional, pur 
poseful conduct. A is incorrect because
it misstates contract law. B is incorrect,
since the suit is based on tort, not on
breach of any agreement between the
colleges. D is incorrect in that it indi 
cates a tort action would lie if the con 
duct was not intentional.

TCJiIS 1m

21. B is the correct answer because the neg 
ligence per se rule provides that a stat 
ute sets the duty of care when the plain 
tiff is within the protected class and the
statute was designed to prevent against
the type of injury which occurred. A is
incorrect because it states the res ipsa
loquitor rule. C is incorrect because a
statute, not the jury, determines the duty
of care in a negligence per se case. D is
incorrect because the negligence ofPe 
ter has no bearing on the application of
the negligence per se standard.

22. B is the best answer, since Sherry can
argue that it was not reasonably fore 
seeable that a person would steal her
car and drive it negligently. If the court
finds Peter's actions to be a supersed 
ing cause, Sherry will not be liable. A
is incorrect because the last clear chance
doctrine is a rule designed to save the
plaintiff's case when he is contributorily
negligent. The facts here do not show
any negligence on the part of Alfred. C
is incorrect because it overstates the
effect of an intentional tortfeasor in a
negligence case. Intentional acts are not
always unforeseeable. D is incorrect
because Sherry's insurance coverage is
irrelevant.

18. D is the correct answer, since, under the
doctrine of transferred intent, Professor
Smith is held to have intended to com 
mit the battery against Davey. A is not
correct because the transferred intent
rule is a legal fiction that does impute
intent. B is incorrect, since a defendant
is responsible for all personal injuries
resulting from a tort. C is an incorrect
statement of the transferred intent doc 
trine. If one intends to commit an as 
sault on one person and batters another,
transferred intent applies.

19. B is the correct answer, because dam 
ages are presumed in trespass cases.
Even if Eunice cannot show actual dam 
age, the law will allow nominal dam 
ages. A is incorrect because the facts
show Calvin was a trespasser, not a lic 
ensee. C is incorrect because the only
intent necessary for trespass is to walk
on the land, an intent that Calvin had.
D is incorrect for the same reason stated
in B.

20. D is the correct answer because Eunice
(as a land owner/occupier) owes a duty
to an undiscovered trespasser not to set
traps for him. A is incorrect for the rea 
son stated above. The fact that the land
was posted is irrelevant. B is incorrect
because Calvin is not a licensee. C is
incorrect because Eunice cannot protect
her property by use of a trap.

1m 1Q11S

23. C is the correct answer because a child
who engages in adult activity, such as
driving a car, is held to the adult stan 
dard of the reasonable prudent person.
A is incorrect, since Peter will not be
liable in the absence of fault. B is in 
correct because the subjective standard
for children does not apply when a mi 
nor is engaged in adult activity. D is
incorrect because a twelve-year-old can
be negligent.

24. A is the correct answer because most
jurisdictions follow the zone of danger
rule. Dieter was a reasonably foresee 
able plaintiff because Eddie was aware
of his presence and it is unlikely that
Dieter will be feigning his injuries. B
is incorrect, since most jurisdictions do
not require a physical impact. C is in 
correct, since the close relationship re 
quirement applies only when a witness
is outside the zone of danger. D is in 
correct for the reasons stated in A.

25. A is the correct answer because the
common law recognized joint and sev 
eral liability for joint tortfeasors. B is
incorrect because indemnification in 
volves a claim for payment that one
tortfeasor has against another. C is in 
correct because contribution involves a
claim by one tortfeasor against another
for a fair sharing of damage liability. D
is an incorrect statement of law.

26. D is the correct answer, as Denton has
lawfully come onto Miller's property
primarily for his own purposes as an
employee of Power Company. A is in 
correct because Denton's entry was
lawful in light of the easement. B is in 
correct, as Denton did not enter Miller's
land at the express or implied invita 
tion of Miller. C is incorrect, since the
facts do not show that Denton was
Miller's social guest.

27. B is the correct answer because the duty
of care owed by a landowner to a lic 
ensee is only to warn of dangers known
by the landowner. A is incorrect because
since Denton is not an undiscovered
trespasser, Miller does owe him a duty
of care. C is incorrect, since a land 
owner owes this more extensive duty
to an invitee. D is incorrect because the
common law recognized a more lim 
ited duty for landowners than the rea 
sonable prudent person test.

28. C is the correct answer because
plaintiff's contributory negligence,
even if slight, totally barred recovery
against a defendant at common law. A
is incorrect; even under comparative
fault principles, Arlen would not re 
cover the full $100,000. B is incorrect,
since this is the result under a compara 
tive negligence scheme. D is incorrect
because the facts do not show that Arlen
voluntarily assumed the risk of a known
danger.

nus fDI

29. A is the correct answer, since the last
clear chance rule "saves" the contribu 
torily negligent plaintiff's case and puts
the entire burden of loss on defendant.
B is incorrect, since the last clear chance
rule does not apportion damages ac 
cording to degree of fault. C is incor 
rect for the reason stated in A. D is in 
correct for the same reason that A is
correct.

30. D is the correct answer because under
Columbia's modified comparative neg 
ligence statute, Wanda will recover
nothing because her negligence was
greater than Tom's. A is incorrect be 
cause Wanda is given the full amount
of her damages without consideration
of her fault. B is incorrect because of
the statutory language; it would be an
incorrect calculation even under a pure
comparative negligence scheme. C is
incorrect because of the statutory lan 
guage. If Columbia had a pure compara 
tive fault system like California's, this
would be the correct answer.

31. C is the correct answer. The Restate 
ment Second of Torts establishes that
one who carries on an abnormally dan 
gerous activity is subject to liability for
harm to the person, land or chattels of
another resulting from the activity, al 
though he has exercised the utmost care
to prevent the harm. Here, in these facts
Gasco, through the escaping gas, causes
harm to repairman. Even though the
escaping gas was not caused by any
fault on Gasco's part, they will be sub 
ject to liability. A is incorrect as there
was no intentional touching (a require 
ment of battery). B is incorrect because
there was no invasion of the repairman's
use and enjoyment of his land. D is in 
correct because Gasco was not negli 
gent.

32. D is the correct answer. Where strict li 
ability is applied, evidence that Gasco
is without fault is of no consequence.
A and B are incorrect because the justi 
fication for strict liability is that, "use 
ful but dangerous activities must pay
their own way." The fact that extreme
care was used will not matter. C is in 
correct because the gas was not negli 
gently stored.

fiB lQilS

33. C is the correct answer. The general rule
is that contributory negligence is not a
defense to strict liability. The only ex 
ception is where the plaintiff knows of
the danger and his negligence is the
cause of the activity creating harm. A
is incorrect because the repairman did
not know of the risk much less assume
it. B is incorrect because the repairman
was not negligent. D, although a cor 
rect statement, is not the best answer
since it fails to spot the issue of the gen 
eral relevance of contributory negli 
gence to strict liability.

34. A is the best answer. Liability only ex 
tends to foreseeable hazards. Although
it is arguable whether this type of dam 
age was foreseeable, because the an 
swer choice indicates that the damages
claimed by the car lot were unforesee 
able, this is the best alternative. B is an
incorrect statement because the fair
market value is protected. C is arguably
factually correct, butAremains the bet 
ter answer because it is a correct state 
ment of the law. D is an incorrect state 
ment of law.

35. D is the correct answer. Where one is
responsible for putting another in peril
then a duty is owed to one who attempts
a rescue as long as the rescuer is acting
reasonably under the circumstances.
Here, neighbor was acting reasonably
in trying to assist repairman. The haste
in the rescue attempt is what caused
neighbor to trip in the gopher hole and
Gasco will be liable. A is incorrect as
neighbor did not assume the risk. B is
incorrect because neighbor's conduct
does not have to be foreseeable, just rea 
sonable under the circumstances. C is
not a complete statement as to why
Gasco would owe liability, and, there 
fore, D is the better answer.

36. B is the best answer. Shopper will ar 
gue that she was a potential customer
since she may come back later and
make a purchase. Courts have held that
one who enters a store open to the pub 
lic is a potential customer. Here, Shop 
per, a business invitee, is owed a duty
by Happytime to inspect and remedy
any defect on the premises. Res ipsa
loquitur is relevant when there is a rea 
sonable presumption that the defendant
is the negligent actor. A is incorrect
because the door could be defective
without negligence. C is not the best
theory because if Shopper was only a
licensee, Happytime would only owe a
duty to warn of known defects. The
facts do not indicate that Happytime
knew of the defective door. D is incor 
rect because B is a viable theory for
recovery.

TGIIS II

39. B is the best answer. The Doctrine of
Respondeat Superior would cause Otis
to be liable for the negligence of his
employee, which occurred during the
course and scope of employment. A is
not the best answer because Otis was not
negligent - his employee was. Martha
would have a better chance of recovery
against Otis (deep pocket theory) than
the employee. C is incorrect, as strict
liability is not applicable to this fact
pattern involving non-inherently-dan 
gerous-activity. D is incorrect because,
although Otis was not negligent, he can
still be held liable under Respondeat
Superior.

37. A is the best answer. Because there is
absence of evidence as to the breach
of duty owed by Kent, the best theory
is Res Ipsa Loquitur. Under the Re 
statement Second of Torts, it may be
inferred that harm suffered by the
plaintiff is caused by the negligence of
the defendant when: 1) The event is of
a kind which ordinarily does not occur
in the absence of negligence; 2) The
negligence must be within the scope of
a duty that the defendant owes plaintiff;
3) Plaintiff must not have contributed to
his own injury. Therefore, the elements
of Res Ipsa have been satisfied and
would be Pete's best theory of recovery.
Band C are not correct answers because
they would and could not establish fault
on Kent's part. Rather, they are causes
of action brought by the surviving
spouse or the estate. D is an incorrect
and irrelevant statement of law as ap 
plied to these facts. Causation is only
one element of the required proof of a
tort.

38. D is the correct answer. In most courts,
Res Ipsa warrants an inference that
the defendant is negligent. A is incor 
rect. The jury mayor may not agree
on the inference that the defendant is
negligent. B is an incorrect statement
as it would be up to the jury to decide
whether they find Kent negligent or not.
C is incorrect because even if Res Ipsa
is established the jury may find that the
defendant has sufficient evidence to
rebut the presumption. If this were the
case, Pete would not win.

fill TORTS

40. C is the best answer. Martha could es 
tablish the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine
since: 1) Martha is only 6 years of age,
and could not appreciate the dangerous
condition of the pile of rolled window
shades. 2) Since the pile of shades was
an artificial condition created by Otis'
employee, it could be said that the pile
would be attractive to children of
Martha's age. 3) The pile of shades
could have been made safe with little
effort on Otis or his employee's part.
4) It can also be said that the pile of
shades was the cause of Martha's tres 
pass. 5) Otis should have been aware
of the risk, as he should know of the
inquisitive nature of children and the
likelihood that children will go behind
counters. A is incorrect as it is not the
best theory of recovery. B is incorrect
because it is not a complete answer or
the best answer. D is incorrect because
it relies on negligence, which is not the
best theory of law for this case.

41. C is the correct answer. Otis would be
unsuccessful asserting the defense of
contributory negligence, since a find 
ing of Attractive Nuisance would ne 
gate such a possibility. Further, Martha,
being so young, is considered incapable
of contributory negligence. A is incor 
rect because, Martha being of such a
young age, is considered incapable of
assuming any risks. B is incorrect, as
the successful application of the Attrac 
tive Nuisance Doctrine would find Otis
responsible for her injuries. D is an in 
correct statement of law.

42. B is the correct answer. Each of the de 
fendants has the burden of proving that
it was not his gun which fired the dam 
aging pellet. Since this burden is equally
impossible for each defendant, the ef 
fect is to make them jointly and sever 
ally liable. A is incorrect because this
test is used where each of the defen 
dant's acts were a substantial factor in
causing the damage. Here, one of the
defendant's acts was not a substantial
factor. C is incorrect because not only
is the "but for" test not the preferable
test of causation; but also because C will
be unable to prove complete responsi 
bility of either A or B. D is incorrect
for the same reason that B is correct.

TCFCIS EiI

45. D is the correct answer. The security
guard had no reasonable grounds for
suspicion. Shopkeepers privilege would
not apply in this situation. A is incor 
rect, since the store had no privilege to
detain the girls. No reasonable suspi 
cion existed. B is incorrect because, un 
der the facts, the girls were not free to
leave. C is incorrect because the suspi 
cion need not be correct -it need only
be reasonable. Therefore, although C's
conclusion is correct, its reasoning is
incorrect.

46. A is the best answer. Restatement Sec 
ond of Torts. sec. 402A holds that one
who sells any product in a defective
condition unreasonably dangerous to
the user or consumer or to his property
is subject to liability for physical harm
thereby caused to the ultimate user or
consumer. Here, A is the best answer
because Hairco was engaged in the sell 
ing of the product and the product was
defective. Although B is a factually cor 
rect answer, it is not the best answer
because Hairco can be liable even if it
was unaware (and therefore could not
warn) of the product defect. A is a more
concise answer. C is incorrect as it is
legally irrelevant and possibly factually
incorrect. D is incorrect for the same
reasons that A is correct.

43. A is the correct answer. Battery is the
intentional harmful or offensive touch 
ing of another without consent or privi 
lege. Battery extends to any part of the
body or anything attached to it. Thus,
when Mary's body contacted the floor,
a "touching" occurred. This touching
was offensive to Mary, and Sue will be
liable to her for battery. B is incorrect,
as assault requires the intentional plac 
ing of another in reasonable apprehen 
sion of a harmful or offensive touching
without consent or privilege. The facts
indicate that Mary was surprised by Sue
pulling out the chair. Therefore, no ap 
prehension could have been created. C
is incorrect because assault does not
exist in this fact pattern, and Choice C
requires both battery and assault. D is
incorrect, as the facts do not imply that
Sue's conduct was extreme and outra 
geous and calculated to cause severe
emotional distress.

44. B is the best answer. Under Restatement
Second of Torts, "a bodily contact is
offensive if it offends a reasonable sense
of personal dignity." Here, Jogger's
conduct would be acceptable under the
circumstances. A is incorrect because
whether harm was caused to Brunette
or not is not at issue. C is incorrect be 
cause, under the circumstances, the
touching would not be considered
harmful, or offensive. D is incorrect
because the facts do not indicate that
Brunette felt any apprehension by
Jogger's conduct.

fml lQilS

47. A is the correct answer. Under the "thin
skull" plaintiff doctrine, which is rec 
ognized in all jurisdictions, a person
injured by the negligent conduct of de 
fendant may recover damages to the full
extent of his injuries where his injuries
are more severe (even if resulting in
death) because of a pre-existing condi 
tion such a hemophilia. Note that dam 
ages in a wrongful death case may be
reduced because of the decedent's low 
ered life expectancy due to the pre-ex 
isting condition. B, C and D are incor 
rect for the reasons supporting Choice
A.

48. A is the best answer because the bur 
den of proof is easier than the other two
choices. B is incorrect as the intentional
element is missing and would be needed
to establish battery. C is not the best
answer as the elements of negligence
would be harder to establish. D is not
the best answer as a warranty theory
would be harder to prove than strict li 
ability.

49. C is the correct answer. Although the
shaking of one's fist under the nose of
another person can constitute an assault,
where the fist shaking is accompanied
by a statement that reasonably would
remove the assaultive effect of the
physical act, there is no assault (as in
this fact situation). A is incorrect for the
reasons discussed above. B is incorrect
because the statement of George re 
moved the assaultive effect of the fist
shaking. D is incorrect because a small
person can certainly assault a big per 
son.

50. A is the best answer. Here, Bob can be
liable for trespass to chattel, even
though he did not intend to interfere
with neighbor's property. It is necessary
only that the defendant intended to deal
with the chattel in the manner in which
he did. B is incorrect because, for this
tort, a reasonable good faith mistake is
no defense. C is incorrect because you
cannot have a battery against an animal.
D is not the best answer. Although Bob
could be charged with cruelty to ani 
mals, his good faith mistake would
probably relieve him of liability.

51. C is the correct answer, since Doctor
committed an offensive, unconsented
touching of Marvin when he removed
the mole. Marvin's express consent to
eye surgery does not extend to the
non-emergency surgery on the mole. A
is incorrect because, while the surgery's
success might limit Marvin's damages,
it is not a defense to a battery action. B
is incorrect because the facts do not re 
veal any consent beyond the eye sur 
gery. D is incorrect because the facts
do not show that Doctor was negligent.

52. A is the correct answer because this is
a classic case of res ipsa loquitur. B is
incorrect because a surgeon is not re 
sponsible for an injury unless he is neg 
ligent. C is incorrect because the doc 
trine of res ipsa loquitur creates an in 
ference of negligence, even if there are
no percipient witnesses. D is incorrect
for the same reasons that A is correct.

53. C is the correct answer because, mod 
ernly, there is a national standard for
most medical specialties. A is incorrect
because it does not take into account
that Doctor is a plastic surgeon. B is
incorrect because the national standard
has replaced the local standard. D is in 
correct because it focuses on Doctor's
subjective qualifications rather than on
those expected of all practitioners of
plastic surgery.

1m lQ'IlS

54. B is the correct answer, because the in 
formed consent doctrine provides that
a physician may be liable for an injury,
even if not caused by negligence, if he
fails to inform a patient of material risks
associated with a medical procedure. A
is incorrect because it overstates the
extent of the surgeon's potentialliabil 
ity. C is incorrect because post hoc ergo
propter hoc (because an event hap 
pened, a preceding event must have
been the cause) is not a correct legal
maxim. D is incorrect for the reasons
that B is correct.

55. A is the correct answer because Darren
may have a cause of action for inten 
tional infliction of emotional distress.
Nancy's conduct appears to be inten 
tional, extreme and outrageous; and it
may have caused extreme emotional
distress. It is the best answer of the four.
B is incorrect because a threat of future
action is not an assault. C is incorrect
because Nancy's acts are intentional,
not negligent. D is incorrect because
Darren has not been placed in a false
light by Nancy.

56. D is the correct answer because the tort
of intentional infliction of emotional
distress encompasses reckless conduct,
which might cause emotional distress
to a reasonably foreseeable bystander.
A is incorrect because intent is not al 
ways required. B is incorrect because
transferred intent does not apply in in 
tentional infliction of emotional distress
cases. C is incorrect because it is in 
consistent with the facts.

57. C is the correct answer, because the
modem rule, as reflected in the Restate 
ment of Torts (Second), allows for re 
covery of severe emotional distress
without any physical injury. A is not
correct because a physical impact is not
required. B is incorrect because most
states do not require a showing of physi 
cal consequences as a prerequisite for
recovery. D is incorrect because a plain 
tiff need not show another underlying
intentional tort to recover for intentional
infliction of emotional distress.

58. A is the correct answer because the neg 
ligence per se rule provides that where
a law, ordinance, or administrative regu 
lation is intended to protect a class of
persons from a particular type of harm,
the legislative body has impliedly es 
tablished the duty of care. B is incor 
rect because the general rule is that the
jury cannot deviate from the negligence
per se standard. C is incorrect because
the ordinance obviously is relevant. D
is incorrect because negligence per se,
not res ipsa loquitur, is at issue.

59. C is the correct answer because Otis will
recover if he shows the beating and rob 
bery were reasonably foreseeable. This
is the best of the four answers. A is in 
correct because courts have found pro 
prietors liable where the intentional acts
of third parties are reasonably foresee 
able. B is incorrect because an act may
be reasonably foreseeable, even if it has
yet to occur. D is incorrect because strict
liability does not apply.

60. C is the correct answer because the facts
show that Nellie's negligence was not
the cause in fact of Willard' s injury.
Willard fainted and fell due to his in 
toxication, not because he could not see
where he was going. A is incorrect be 
cause negligence per se relates to the
duty and breach elements which are al 
ready conceded in the question. B is
incorrect because the element in con 
tention is causation in fact, not proxi 
mate cause. D is an incorrect statement
and application of the last clear chance
rule.

61. B is the correct answer because when
the concurrent negligence of two or
more tortfeasors results in an indivis 
ible injury, they are jointly and sever 
ally liable for plaintiff's entire loss. A
is incorrect because the law does not
require Irene to prove proportionate li 
ability under the circumstances. C is
incorrect because each defendant is li 
able for the entire amount. D is incorrect
because there is no evidence that Irene
voluntarily assumed any risk.

62. D is the correct answer because mod 
em law allows contribution among joint
tortfeasors. A is incorrect because the
satisfaction doctrine limits recovery by
a plaintiff who has already recovered
against another joint tortfeasor. B is in 
correct because Hank is not entitled to
indemnification, but only to having
Trucker share in paying the judgment.
C is incorrect because release is not an
issue raised by the facts.

TailS 1m

63. B is correct because automobile guest
statutes require a higher standard of
culpability on a defendant's part - such
as gross negligence or reckless conduct.
A is incorrect because ordinary negli-
gence is not actionable if there is a guest
statute. C is incorrect because the cul-
pable conduct need not be intentional.
D is incorrect because Irene can have a
recovery, as stated in B.

64. B is the correct answer because Paul's
intentional harmful contact with Tom
is a battery. A is incorrect because the
facts do not reveal that Tom was in ap-
prehension of the contact before it oc-
curred. C is incorrect because the facts
do not show that Paul intended to cause
emotional distress or that Tom suffered
any distress. D is incorrect because this
activity does not give rise to a strict li-
ability tort.

65. C is the correct answer because by play-
ing baseball, Tom impliedly consented
to possible harmful contact that is
within the rules of the game. A is in-
correct because contributory negligence
is not a defense to an intentional tort,
and also because there is no evidence
that Tom was negligent in any case. B
is incorrect because justification is not
a defense raised by the facts. D is in-
correct for the same reason.

1m mils

66. D is the correct answer, since Pam has
not entered Scott's property. A, Band
C are incorrect because they relate to
categories of persons who are on a
landowner's property for different rea-
sons.

67. A is the correct answer because a land-
owner owes a person off the premises a
duty of ordinary care with respect to
artificial conditions the landowner
maintains. B is incorrect because this
is the duty owed a licensee. C is in-
correct because this is the duty owed a
discovered trespasser. D is incorrect for
the same reasons that A is correct.

68. D is the correct answer because it was
reasonably foreseeable that an act of
God could cause the corroded cables to
give way. A is incorrect because an in-
tervening act of God does not automati-
cally relieve one of liability for negli-
gence. B, which is really a rephrasing
of A, is incorrect for the same reason.
C is incorrect because it overstates the
potential liability of a defendant by not
taking foreseeability into account at all.

69. C is the correct answer. In personal in-
jury cases, the adage "you take the
plaintiff as you find her" is still the
majority rule. A is incorrect because
personal injury damages are not limited
to what the defendant might reasonably
foresee. B is incorrect because this is
not a preexisting injury case. D is in-
correct for the same reasons that C is
correct.

70. C is the correct answer because at com 
mon law a cause of action personal to a
plaintiff terminated when the person
died. A is incorrect because wrongful
death actions were not recognized at
common law and, also, because, mod 
ernly, this is a survival claim. B is in 
correct because survival claims were
not recognized at common law. D is in 
correct for the same reasons that C is
correct.

71. A is the correct answer because lost fi 
nancial support, services and society are
available to designated beneficiaries
under a statutorily-created wrongful
death action. B is incorrect because sur 
vival statutes typically allow an estate
to recover for injuries sustained by the
decedent only until the time of death.
C is incorrect because the husband and
children do not qualify for a negligent
infliction of emotional distress claim
and could not recover the damages
mentioned in the question in this type
of action, in any case. D is incorrect
because, without the wrongful death
statute, Grover would not have negli 
gence liability to the husband and chil 
dren.

72. B is the correct answer because an em 
ployer is responsible for the negligence
of an employee, so long as the employee
was acting within the scope of his em 
ployment. Ais incorrect, as the facts do
not state the Army was negligent in hir 
ing Grover. C is incorrect because the
nondelegable duty rule applies to inde 
pendent contractor cases. D is incorrect
because the facts show Grover was not
an independent contractor and Inge's
family certainly would not argue that
he was.

73. C is the correct answer because the
Army will not be vicariously liable for
Grover's negligence if his activity,
when the accident occurred, was totally
unrelated to Army business. A is incor 
rect because the Army would be liable
if Grover were acting within the scope
of his employment. B is incorrect be 
cause superseding cause is not an issue.
D is incorrect because the nondelegable
duty rule applies in the independent
contractor setting.

74. B is the correct answer because Con 
gress waived sovereign immunity in
numerous cases, including negligence,
under the Federal Tort Claims Act of
1946. A is incorrect because sovereign
immunity has never been held to vio 
late the Equal Protection Clause. C is
incorrect because until 1946, United
States government agencies did enjoy
sovereign immunity. D is incorrect be 
cause Congress has waived the immu 
nity in negligence cases.

75. D is the correct answer. Since the state 
ment is not libelous on its face, Sally
Smith must show facts that make the
otherwise innocent statement action 
able. (This fact would be that she is
unmarried.) This is called a reasonable
innuendo. A is incorrect because the
statement is not libelous on its face. B
is incorrect because there has been pub 
lication to others who read the newspa 
per. C is incorrect because the statement
clearly related to the only person named
Sally Smith in the community.

76. D is the correct answer because libel
was a strict liability tort at common law.
Defendants were liable for unintended
and innocent defamation. A, Band C
are incorrect because they all state that
some degree of fault was required in a
common law libel action.

77. A is the correct answer because retrac 
tion and apology are steps a libel de 
fendant can take to limit the damages
caused by a libelous statement. B is in 
correct because the collateral source
rule relates to payments made to a plain 
tiff from a source independent of the
defendant. This doctrine is not raised
by the facts. C is incorrect because the
facts do not show Sally Smith received
any benefit from the libel. D is incorrect
because retraction and apology only
mitigate damages and do not com 
pletely relieve a defendant of liability.

BB TCJiIS

78. B is the correct answer because, al 
though the defamatory statement was
"spoken" on the tape, it has been re 
duced to permanent physical form
through the taping and, thus, would be
libel. A and C are incorrect because they
relate to spoken defamation that is tran 
sitory. D is incorrect because the state 
ment is libelous on its face, without
need to refer to extrinsic evidence.

79. C is the correct answer because a book 
seller who sells libelous matter with 
out knowledge is not liable under the
secondary publisher rule. A is incorrect
because it does not take into account
the exception stated in C. B is incorrect
because Cleo and Roman did not have
a relationship that would give rise to
vicarious liability. D is incorrect be 
cause, since Cleo is not liable, an in 
demnification issue would not arise.

80. B is the correct answer. When a public
official or figure sues for libel related
to a matter of public concern, "actual
malice" as defined in New York Times
v. Sullivan becomes part of the
plaintiff's prima facie case. A is in 
correct because this definition is typi 
cally used for punitive damages by state
courts. C is incorrect, since this is the
rule established in Gertz v. Robert
Welch Co. for private persons defamed
on matters of public concern. D is in 
correct because it embodies the com 
mon law rule, before the Supreme Court
decisions beginning with New York
Times.

81. B is the correct answer, as the Supreme
Court held, in New York Times, that the
burden of proof for "actual malice" is
clear and convincing evidence. There 
fore, A, C and D are incorrect.

82. A is the correct answer because Jenny
has defamed Harriet by accusing her of
unethical business practices and per 
haps, also, the commission of a crime.
Thus, the statement is slander per se for
two reasons. B is incorrect because
there is no slander per quod theory of
recovery. C is incorrect because the
statement goes beyond simple slander.
D is incorrect because this tort does not
protect a plaintiff's reputation interest.

83. C is correct, since Jenny's statement is
an opinion that does not appear to be
premised on false underlying facts. A
is incorrect because the Gertz holding,
regarding opinion, has subsequently
been interpreted in Malkoyich as not
protecting all opinions under a First
Amendment umbrella. B is incorrect
because it does not address the opinion
issue, and also because lawyers are not
always public figures. D is incorrect
because, modernly, an opinion not
based on underlying false facts is not
defamation.

84. C is the correct answer. A witness testi 
fying in a court proceeding has abso 
lute immunity from defamation liabil 
ity, provided the statements relate to
issues in the trial. A is incorrect because
assumption of risk does not apply in
defamation actions. B is incorrect be 
cause this is not a conditional privilege
case. D is incorrect because it overstates
the breadth of the absolute immunity.

85. B is the correct answer. Aaron is a
republisher. The fact that Clyde did not
believe the statement is not required. It
is sufficient that the person understand
the words as accusing plaintiff of some
disgrace. A is incorrect because Aaron
is not protected by the reporter's privi 
lege. C is incorrect because no condi 
tional privilege is raised by the facts. D
is incorrect for the same reason B is
correct.

86. D is the correct answer. Modernly, a
manufacturer is strictly liable for a
manufacturing defect. A is incorrect
because privity of contract between a
manufacturer and a purchaser is no
longer required. B is incorrect because
a purchaser need not prove negligence
to recover for a personal injury caused
by a dangerously defective product. C
is incorrect because a manufacturing
defect, not a design defect, caused the
injury.

TOOlS II

87. B is the correct answer. Most states to 
day allow bystanders to recover for per 
sonal injuries caused by dangerously
defective products, so long as they were
reasonably foreseeable bystanders. Ais
incorrect because every party in the
manufacturing/marketing chain is liable
for injuries caused by a dangerously
defective product. C is incorrect be 
cause privity is not required. D is in 
correct because a bystander need not be
a family member to recover for personal
injuries.

88. A is the best answer because a plaintiff
may not recover in strict liability in tort,
if the manufacturer can show that the
product has been altered after it leaves
the manufacturer's hands. B is incorrect
because snowmobiles are not inherently
dangerous products, and because
Marlene did not assume the risk that the
product would be defective. C is incor 
rect because the facts do not show that
Marlene's inexperience caused the ac 
cident. D is incorrect because a manu 
facturer is strictly liable, even though it
took all possible care to avoid manu 
facturing defects.

89. C is the correct answer. The Restate 
ment of Torts and the courts recognize
that, although some products pose a risk
of injury, where their utility outweighs
the risk, they are not unreasonably dan 
gerous. Many new drugs fall within this
category. A is incorrect because there
is no manufacturing defect. B is incor 
rect because the design defect is not
unreasonably dangerous. D is incorrect
because drug manufacturers do not have
a blanket exemption from strict liabil 
ity rules.

90. C is the correct answer. An adequate
warning to a "learned intermediary"
(here the doctor) is generally held to be
a warning to the patient. A is incorrect
because in the case of prescription
drugs, the warning need not be directly
to the consumer. B is incorrect because
it overstates the liability of a drug manu 
facturer. D is incorrect because drug
manufacturers do not have a blanket
exemption from strict liability rules.

91. B is the correct answer. The injury was
caused by the carelessness of Blaster
Co. 's employee. A is incorrect because
Susan was not injured as a result of ac 
tivity that was abnormally dangerous.
(Had the container exploded, the result
would be different.) C is incorrect be 
cause injuries caused when a person
falls over a container in a dark aisle are
reasonably foreseeable. D is incorrect
because the facts do not mention a
worker's compensation statute, and also
because these laws usually affect only
those in employer-employee relation 
ships.

92. D is the correct answer. Susan can re 
cover from Rudy because he was neg 
ligent and from Blaster Co. because it
is vicariously liable for the negligence
of its employee. A is incorrect because
Rudy was acting within the scope of his
employment when he was negligent. B
is incorrect for the same reason. C is
incorrect because it states Susan can
recover from Rudy only.

93. B is the correct answer. Since Crispco
used an inadequate wire in all its toast 
ers, this is a design defect that created
an unreasonable risk of danger. A is in 
correct because this is not a manufac 
turing defect. C is incorrect because
whether Crispco warned Arlene or not
is irrelevant. D is incorrect because neg 
ligence might be more difficult to prove,
and because the statement about privity
is incorrect.

94 D is the correct answer. A tort suit is
not an appropriate means of insuring the
quality of a product. A, Band C are all
incorrect because Arlene cannot recover
for loss of the product itself under a tort
theory. If Arlene wants to recover for
pure economic loss, including loss of
the product, she may recover under a
warranty theory, which may include a
suit for breach of implied or express
warranties.

95. D is the correct answer. Generally, a
person has no duty to come to the aid
of one in distress. A is incorrect because
the common law did not recognize a
duty to rescue. B is incorrect because
most states have not changed the com 
mon law rule. C is incorrect because
although the AMA rule is correctly
stated, it has not been applied in tort
cases.

96. C is the correct answer. In a jurisdic 
tion with a Good Samaritan statute, a
physician who administers aid in an
emergency is not liable for mere negli 
gence, but instead must have acted reck 
1essly or willfully and wantonly in caus 
ing an injury. A is incorrect because
Good Samaritan statutes insulate phy 
sicians from liability for negligence in
emergencies. B is incorrect because it
misstates the effect of Good Samaritan
statutes. D is incorrect because Sandra
will not be liable for negligence, as
stated above.

lQilS Em

99. B is the correct answer. Most jurisdic 
tions that recognize a wrongful life
claim limit, recovery to special dam 
ages. A is incorrect because general
damages are not usually allowed. (This
is because a jury cannot determine dam 
ages based on the difference between
non-life and life in an impaired state.)
C is incorrect because it includes gen 
eral damages. D is incorrect because it
includes general damages and punitive
damages, which are generally not avail 
able in negligence cases.

100. C is the correct answer. Although an
attorney usually does not owe a duty
of care to a non-client, an exception
has been recognized in cases where a
specific person is an intended benefi 
ciary of a will. A and B are incorrect
because privity is not universally re 
quired in attorney malpractice cases.
D is incorrect because Fred's recov 
ery will not be limited to the amount
of the fee. He may recover all proxi 
mately caused damages from Wanda
for her negligence.

101. B is the correct answer. A is incorrect,
since it states one of the elements of
negligence which is not necessary, in
strict liability, under 402A. C is incor 
rect because 402A expressly excludes
any requirement of privity. D is incor 
rect because 402A is equally appli 
cable to a lease transaction, although
warranty theories do require a techni 
cal sale.

97. B is the correct answer. When a child
sues a health care provider for damages
caused when the provider negligently
failed to discover a possible birth de 
fect in a fetus, the claim is called a
wrongful life claim. A is incorrect be 
cause wrongful birth is the term used
when a parent sues for damages in the
same circumstances. C is incorrect be 
cause this is plainly not a wrongful
death claim. D is incorrect for the same
reason that B is correct.

98. B is the correct answer. If Clara in 
tended to give birth to Randolph in any
case, Anna was not the cause in fact of
Randolph's birth. A is incorrect because
a health care provider does not cause
the injury in a wrongful life case, but
rather deprives the mother of an oppor 
tunity to end the pregnancy. C is in 
correct because most courts would find
these special damages reasonably fore 
seeable. D is incorrect because a waiver
ofliability in a medical malpractice case
would not be enforced - it violates
public policy.

Em lCJiIS

102. A is the correct answer. A design de 
fect is found when the product is made
avoidable hazard to the user. The es-
sence of design defect is the concept
of unreasonably dangerous, and an
avoidable danger is an unreasonable
danger. B is incorrect because it is a
nonsense statement. A manufacturing
defect is found when the product is not
made as intended. C is incorrect be 
cause a marketing defect is found when
the maker has failed to warn the user
of a danger known to the maker. D is
also a nonsense statement because fab 
rication means the same as manufac 
turing, and if the product was as in 
tended it is not a fabrication or manu 
facturing defect.

103. D is the correct answer. There is a line
of cases which would support the de 
will succeed. A is clearly irrelevant be-
cause knowledge of the hazard is im 
portant to negligence but not necessary
for liability under 402A. B is clearly
erroneous because it is not possible to
disclaim liability under 402A. C is
clearly wrong both factually and le 
gally because Peter was not unreason 
able in driving in traffic and contribu 
tory negligence is not a defense to strict
liability. The theory of D, that the pre 
cipitating cause of the injury was the
negligence of another driver and that
the maker has no duty to create a crash
proof car, has been rejected by a ma 
jority of the courts, but at one time was
a supportable and arguable defense, so
it is the best defense offered.

104. C is the correct answer. Concurrent
tortfeasors always bear the burden of
apportioning loss or they are jointly
and severally liable for the entire loss.
Tera can obviously apportion the prop 
erty damage, but will probably be
jointly and severally liable for all of
Peter's personal injury, at least the pa 
ralysis. A is incorrect because techni 
cally Tetra is liable only for the en 
hanced damages. The question is who
has the burden of apportionment. B is
incorrect because, under the facts, ap 
portionment will be virtually impos 
sible. D is incorrect because Peter does
not have the burden of apportioning
damages caused by joint and concur 
rent tortfeasors at modem law.

lCFCIS II

105. A is the correct answer. The courts
have consistently drawn a line at what
type of damages may be recovered
under negligence and 402A. Damage
caused to persons or property other
than the defective product itself may
be recovered, but any damages other
than that are deemed part of the loss
of the benefit of the bargain. Here, lost
profits clearly are a pure economic
loss, and the cost of replacing the car 
pet is probably also not recoverable
under either of these two theories. B
is wrong because it does not fit within
the concept of damages to persons or
property, other than the defective prod 
uct. C is incorrect because lost profits
from the defective product are clearly
a pure economic loss.

106. D is the correct answer. Since any war 
ranty would permit recovery based on
the "benefit of the bargain", lost prof 
its and expenses of replacing the de 
fective product fit within this concept.
A and B are incorrect for the reasons
expressed in the analysis of question
105. C would permit recovery if it
could be proven, but on these facts
there is no Express Warranty shown.

107. C is the correct answer because an in 
tentional or criminal intervening act is
normally unforeseeable as a matter of
law; however, the defense will fail in
this case, since the arsonist is within
the risk created by the sale of the de 
fective carpet. A is not an arguable
defense, since lack of privity is no
longer a defense in any of the theo 
ries, including horizontal privity, since
Patricia would be covered by all of the
alternatives set forth in the Uniform
Commercial Code. B is not even an
arguable defense, since Prince Hotel's
intervening passive negligence would
not protect Questa. D is not arguable,
since a guest at a hotel is clearly
foreseeably at risk from the defective
product.

108. D is the correct answer, even though
punitive damages are not normally
available in products cases, because
Questa exhibited a callous disregard
for the high probability of injury to
hotel guests and chose to expose them
to the risk to make a little extra profit.
This would be the equivalent of im 
plied Malice and subject Questa to pu 
nitive damages. All other answers are
incorrect because they do not include
punitive damages.

Em TCJ'IIS

109. B is the correct answer. The hotel
would owe Patricia a duty of inspec 
tion to discover defects in the premises.
A is not correct, since 402A is appli 
cable only to a commercial seller of
products. C is incorrect, since 402B
requires a representation and a sale of
a product, neither of which is present
here. D is also incorrect, since it re 
quires a technical sale of a product, al 
though some courts have constructed
a 'hybrid' form of warranty called
"warranty of habitability", which
could conceivably fit this situation, but
only a few courts have adopted it.

110. A is the correct answer. The parties are
not in pari delicto, Prince Hotel being,
at most, only passively negligent. Also,
Questa has breached its implied war 
ranty of merchantability to Prince Ho 
tel. B is not correct, since Prince would
be entitled to indemnity on these facts.
C is not correct, since the doctrine of
equitable apportionment is found in
only a few states.

111. C is the correct answer because Baxter
was aware of the side effect of the drug
in 1986 and marketed the drug with 
out a warning of the hazard after 1986.
A is not correct, since there is no indi 
cation of mismanufacturing. B is not
correct, since the drug clearly passes
the cost/benefit and risk/benefit analy 
ses and is unavoidably hazardous.

112. B is the correct answer. Since A, the
sine qua non test, will not find causa 
tion, according to the experts. She
probably would have gone blind, even
if she had not taken the Betacin. How 
ever, since long term use of the Betacin
would also have caused blindness,
most courts would hold that Betacin
was a substantial factor in causing her
injury and would hold Baxter liable.
Neither C nor D can be correct, since
Pauline does not find it impossible to
prove cause in fact. Both Alternative
liability and Market Share are substi 
tutes for causation when Pauline can 
not prove that the defendant's act
caused the injury, although it could
have.

113. D is the correct answer. Dr. Smith con 
tinued to prescribe the drug even after
the warning was given, and we can in 
fer that he would have done the same
thing had the warning been given ear 
lier. If a warning would not have
changed the plaintiff's actions, then the
warning cannot be the cause in fact.
The other options all contain good ar 
guments why Pauline should have
taken the drug, but in the final analy 
sis whether she exposes herself to the
hazard of the drug, rather than the haz 
ard of the disease, has to be her choice
and she is deprived of this choice by
not being given a warning.

100iS 1m

114. A is the correct answer because
Pauline has the right to decide for her 
self whether to accept the risk of medi 
cal treatment. Band e are clearly
wrong, since they both require sales
of products, which medical doctors do
not engage in. D is incorrect, since
balancing the risks against the benefits
will show that Dr. Smith was not un 
reasonable in subjecting her to the risk
of the drug to avoid the disease.

115. B is the correct answer. Exposure to
any asbestos provided by any of the
many suppliers over the years could
be sufficient to produce asbestosis.
Thus, A is incorrect because, if Ajax's
conduct is removed from the factual
equation, the damage will probably
still occur. e is incorrect, since Pete
can prove that Ajax's conduct was the
cause of his injury, and D is not cor 
rect, since he can identify at least one
of the suppliers. D is also incorrect,
since it would not give him a complete
recovery. Each maker would only have
to pay its percentage of the injury co 
incident with its market share. In the
many decades of exposure, many of
the suppliers will have gone out of
business and can't be held liable for
their percentage.

BllQilS

116. e is the correct answer. Since long
term exposure to asbestos is necessary
for the onset of asbestosis, the fact that
Ajax has only been in the business for
five years may be sufficient to con 
vince a jury that Ajax could not have
been even a substantial factor in Pete's
damage. A is incorrect, since it refers
to D's knowledge of the hazard as a
prerequisite to its duty to warn. A seller
of a product is held to be aware of all
knowledge available in the industry
and the facts indicate that the industry
has been aware of the hazard for sev 
eral decades. B is irrelevant. P is su 
ing for failure to warn, and D is incor 
rect because A and B are incorrect.

117. D is the correct answer. The uee has
provided three alternatives for states
to adopt to permit recovery for con 
sumers who are not in vertical privity
with the manufacturer. The first of
these alternatives would permit recov 
ery by natural persons for personal in 
jury who were members of the
purchaser's family or his guests. Un 
der this alternative, Pete would lack the
requisite horizontal privity for recov 
ery under breach of implied warranty.
A is not correct, since a representation
is not necessary to create an implied
warranty of merchantability. B is not
correct, since, although warranties are
still subject to disclaimer, a disclaimer
for personal injury to a consumer is
prima facie unconscionable. e is not
correct, since vertical privity is no
longer necessary since the decision in
Henningsen.

118. C is the correct answer because her
only damages are to the defective prod 
llrt it<:f"lf llnrl wnlllrl hI" rlf"f"mf"rl nllrf"
the bargain. A and B are not correct,
since both 402A and Negligence
would permit recover only for personal
injury and damage to property other
than the defective product.

119. A is the correct answer because, on
these facts, the only express warranty
was made by Wily Car Co in its tele 
vision ads, and there are no facts show 
ing that Jim adopted the express war 
ranty. Band C are incorrect, since
Patricia has both vertical and horizon 
tal privity with Jim's Offroad Shoppe.
D is incorrect, since Patricia can eas 
ily show a defect under a warranty
theory by showing that the product did
not perform as intended.

120. D is the correct answer. It can be in 
ferred that the transmission was defec-
tivf" hf"rllll<:f" it rlirl nnt nf"rfnrm ~<: it
ipsa is limited to proving breach of
duty in a negligence case and here she
is suing in 402A. B is not correct, since
her expert's opinion, that a missing
spring was "possibly" the cause, does
not meet the minimum standard for the
plaintiff's burden of proof by a pre 
ponderance of the evidence. The me 
chanical engineer would have to tes 
tify that the missing spring was "more
likely than not" the cause, or that it was
"probably" the cause. C comes close
to being correct, but it is merely a state 
ment of the various facts she would
adduce to bolster a circumstantial evi 
dence case by negating other possible
causes of the accident.

lQilS Ell

121. C is the correct answer. The Evidence
Code specifically excludes such evi 
dence for the reason stated, although a
few courts, including California, have
ruled otherwise with respect to Strict
Liability actions. A is incorrect, since
the facts indicate that Patricia is suing
for negligence in addition to 402A, so
fault is at issue. B is incorrect because
the fact that the evidence would tend
to show that Wily Car Co. felt that the
cast aluminum was not strong enough
for the rigors expected and this would
certainly be relevant to Patricia's claim
that her vehicle failed because of a de 
fective design. D is not correct, since
consciousness of guilt is not a part of
a civil case, and would be barred by
the public policy to encourage safety
measures in any event.

QUESTIONS

Questions I — 6 are based on the
following facts:

Art Kittect was a very successful designer
and builder of custom-made homes in South-
ern California. After lengthy discussions
with Bob and numerous revisions of the
plans, Art agreed to build a home for Bob.
Art and Bob signed a contract providing that
Bob's duty to pay would not arise unless the
home was constructed according to the con-
struction plans, except to the extent of con-
struction changes approved in writing.

1. Assume that Art began construction of
the home but determined that there was
a shortage of roofing tile because of
recent large-scale efforts to rebuild
many local homes destroyed in seasonal
fires. When contacted on the telephone,
Bob agreed with Art to the construction
of a "shake" roof because of the tile
shortage. After a week, Bob decided
that his "dream home" must be com-
pleted as he originally planned and told
Art he wanted the tile roof. Art refused
because he knew the tiles would be dif-
ficult to obtain, although he had not pur-
chased the shake roof materials. If Bob
brings an action against Art for breach
of contract, the court will most likely
find for:

A. Art, because Bob waived his
rights to have the tile roof in-
stalled.

B. Art, because Bob agreed to

modify the contract.   

C. Bob, because of Art's pre-exist-
ing duty to use the roofing tiles.

D. Bob, because the modification
must be expressly agreed upon.

2. Assume that while Art was construct-
ing Bob's home, the IRS notified Art
of its intent to audit him. When Bob, a
tax accountant, heard Art grumbling to
himself about the upcoming audit, Bob
volunteered to meet with the IRS to re-
solve Art's problem. Fearing the worse,
Art was ecstatic to learn that Bob was
able to reach a favorable resolution on
his behalf. Knowing that Bob had
wanted an automatic garage door
opener, but did not include one within
the plans because of financial reasons,
Art stated to Bob, "The Genie door
raiser we talked about is yours. I'll pull
one off another job and install it on
Monday." On Monday, Art's generos-
ity fizzles and he refuses to supply the
door opener. Bob sues. The court will
find for:

A. Art, since Bob's gratuitous ser-
vices were insufficient consider-
ation for Art's promise.

SIMULATED BAR 295

B. Art, since the parole evidence
rule bars oral testimony of Art's
promIse.

C. Bob, since Art's statement con 
stituted an enforceable moral
obligation.

D. Bob, since the doctrine of prom 
issory estoppel is a substitute for
Bob's otherwise gratuitous ser 
vices.

3. Assume that the contract provides for
the installation of an automatic garage
door opener, but does not mention the
type of door opener to be used. Art has
installed a 1/2 horsepower motor for the
door opener. Garage doors of similar
size and type to Bob's reasonably re 
quire a 1 horsepower motor. Bob has
noticed the 1/2 horsepower motor and
states, "You'll never get paid." If Art
files a lawsuit to obtain payment, Art
will recover:

D. Full price, but less any damages
for Art's breach of the implied
duty to install a motor with the
reasonably required amount of
power.

4. Assume for this question, that Art has
agreed to complete Bob's home by Au 
gust 1. On July 15, when construction
of Bob's home is about 80% complete,
the home is accidentally destroyed by
fire, without fault of either Art or Bob.
Art seeks to recover for the work pre 
viously performed. Will Art prevail?

A. Yes, for the reasonable value of
his services less cost of comple 
tion of the home.

B Yes, for 80% of the contract price

less Bob's damages.

C. No, because no benefit was con 
ferred upon Bob because of the
destruction of the home.

A. Full price, because he substan 
tially performed the contract.

D. No, if Art cannot complete the

home by August 1.

B. Full price, because neither the
contract nor plans specified the
type of motor to be used.

C. Nothing, because there was no
meeting of the minds due to the
failure ofArt and Bob to set forth
each material term in the written
contract.

5. Assume for this question, that the con 
tract between Art and Bob provided that
Bob would pay Art only upon receipt
of an "architect's certificate," which
certifies that the house was built in ac 
cordance with the Architect's Code of
Standards. Bob hired Conrad, a highly
reputable architect, to inspect the house
and to issue the certification. Conrad
inspected the home, but refuses to is 
sue the certification because the house
was not constructed in a workmanlike
manner pursuant to the Standards. Bob
refuses to pay the contract price. If Art
brings suit against Bob for the contract
price, the court will most likely find for:

A. Art, if Conrad has made a gross

mistake in his decision.

B. Art, unless Bob proves the home
was not constructed in a work 
manlike manner.

C. Bob, because both Art and Bob
agreed to the condition that per 
formance must be to the satisfac 
tion of a third person.

D. Bob, unless Art can prove an 
other architect would have issued
an architect's certificate.

6. Assume that Art assigned his rights
under the Art/Bob contract to Univer 
sity for the outstanding college tuition
bills of Art's daughter, Gloria. Univer 
sity notifies Bob of the assignment, but
Art only completes 50% of the home
before deciding to obtain a Bachelor's
Degree in Business Administration, at
College. College caters to older students
seeking to change careers. Art refuses
to complete the home. What result if
University files an action against Bob
to recover the contract price?

A. Bob will prevail, because the

contract is not assignable.

B. Bob will prevail, but only be 
cause Art did not complete the
job.

C. University will prevail, but will
only receive the reasonable value
of the services performed, less
damages caused by Art's failure
to complete the home.

D. University will prevail, but only
the contract price, less the cost
of completion of the contract.

C. No, because Florence did not
threaten or force Milton into con 
finement.

D. No, because Milton was unaware

of his confinement.

7. Milton was taking a weekend retreat to
his cabin in the local mountains during
the week before Christmas. He had ne 
glected to bring along snow chains,
even though there was the possibility
of snow and ice on the roadway. Al 
though Milton was driving slowly
through the icy areas, he lost control of
his car and crashed, making his car in 
operable. Milton fractured his arm in
the accident, but was able to walk back
to a small cabin IO miles from where
he had crashed.

Florence, a retired nurse, lived at the
cabin and was able to provide medical
treatment to mend Milton's arm. Flo 
rence was also starved for companion 
ship and decided to keep Milton from
leaving by locking the door to the room
where she had placed him. Exhausted
from his injuries and the lO-mile walk,
Milton had fallen fast asleep before Flo 
rence had locked him in the room. Af 
ter a night's sleep, Florence realized
what she was doing was wrong and
unlocked the door. When Milton later
awoke, he asked Florence to telephone
a relative for transportation home, and
Florence complied. Is Florence liable
to Milton for false imprisonment?

A. Yes, because Milton was actually
confined with no reasonable
means of escape.

B. Yes, because Florence intended
to confine Milton within the

Questions 8 - 9 are based on the
following facts:

Robin and Mark were married last week and
set off for a honeymoon in Florida. The state
of Florida has been having a serious prob 
lem with people being robbed in front of
automatic teller machines. Florida has just
imposed a statute to protect their citizens and
tourists. The statute makes it a law that ev 
ery facility where people may obtain money
from an automatic teller machine, must have
a security guard posted during the period the
machine is operative, or in the alternative a
4' x 4' sign must be posted at the facility
warning the consumer of the potential risk
of robbery.

Despite the new law, Bank de Monies
("Bank") did not provide a security guard,
nor did they post a sign at its automatic teller.
On her first evening in Florida, Robin wasn't
feeling very well and decided to stay in the
room to get some extra rest. Mark decided
to go to Disney World and play the arcade
games. Mark made a stop at Bank to with 
draw some money from the automatic teller.
Several hours later, Robin was awakened by
a police officer. She learned that her hus 
band, Mark, was robbed and killed at the
automatic teller machine at Bank. Robin
brings a wrongful death action against Bank.

8. Bank is most likely to prevail under
which of the following theories?

A. The failure to comply with the
statute was not the actual cause
of Mark's death.

B. None of Bank's customers had
ever been killed before at any of
its automatic teller machines.

C. Mark was negligent for using an
automatic teller in an unfamiliar
city.

D. The statute is an ex post facto

law.

9. Assume for this question, that Robin,
upon hearing of her husband's death,
goes into severe emotional distress, re 
quiring a two-week hospitalization be 
fore she recovered. If Robin brings an
action against Bank de Monies based
upon the theory of negligent infliction
of emotional distress, Robin will:

A. Prevail, because Bank de Mon 
ies violated the state statute.

B. Prevail, but only because she
suffered emotional distress.

C. Not prevail, because Robin was
not present at the scene when
Mark was killed.

D. Not prevail, because Robin was
not a foreseeable plaintiff.

Questions 10 -12 are based on the
following facts:

Siegfried "convinces" Max to rob Savings
R Us Bank by handcuffing a locked brief 
case to Max's wrist, telling him it is full of
plastic explosives that will be detonated by
a remote control unit in Siegfried's posses 
sion if Max fails to follow Siegfried's re 
quest. Unknown to Max, the briefcase is
actually full of Play Doh. Max obtains
$100,000.00. from Savings R Us after threat 
ening the bank teller with a loaded gun.
State's penal code makes it a crime to "ob 
tain bank funds by use of a weapon or threat
of injury." Max was arrested before he could
flee the bank.

10. State prosecutor Buck charges Max and
Siegfried with conspiracy to violate the
penal code section. Max and Siegfried
will most likely be found:

II. Max is charged with violating the pe-
nal code section. Is it likely he will be
convicted?

A. Yes, because there is no defense
of duress since there was only
Play Doh in the briefcase.

B. No, because he robbed the bank
under the duress of Siegfried's
threats.

C. Yes, because he threatened the
bank teller with injury if the
money was not given to him.

D. No, because he never intended to

keep the money.

12. Can Siegfried be convicted of the pe-
nal code section even though Max is
acquitted?

A. Guilty, because the general rule
is that withdrawal is not a de 
fense to the crime of conspiracy.

B. Guilty, because Max failed to

13. Gloria, the buyer for Lost Adolescence
("Lost"), a retailer of sophisticated adult
toys, faxes an order to CompuPlay, the
nation's leading manufacturer of video
games. Gloria requests prompt ship

popular game, "Res Gestae," which pits
an escaped convict (the player) against
a crack police force (the game), award 
ing points to the convict for each suc 
cessive crime committed while continu 
ing to elude capture by the police.

CompuPlay tenders the 5,000 games to
Lost one week later, payment in full due
in 30 days. Unknown to Lost, Compu 
Play's programmer had secretly repro 
grammed Res Gestae to be "politically
correct" by always having the convict
immediately captured at the beginning
of the game. This change was not ap 
parent without actually playing the
game. When Gloria tested one of the
games the day after delivery, the change
was discovered. She immediately con 
tacted CompuPlay to return the video
games, but CompuPlay refused. Who
will prevail if Lost sues CompuPlay for
breach of contract?

A. Lost, because CompuPlay ac 
cepted Gloria's offer to buy when
it shipped the non-conforming
games.

B. Lost, because it has the option of
either accepting or rejecting the
non-conforming goods.

C. CompuPlay, because it had the
option of shipping non-conform

line was defective.

C. Nuisance, because Phil's use and
enjoyment of his property was

Questions 19 - 23 are based on the
following facts:

Bugs, the owner of Roach Coach, a mobile
catering van, entered into a contract with
Bart, the owner of Fresh Foods. Bugs and
Bart signed a written contract on December
28. The contract provided that Roach Coach
would purchase all their sandwich require 
ments from Fresh Foods for the following
calendar year. The contract further provided
that no specific purchase quantity was re 
quired, but only the daily requirements
needed by Roach Coach at a fixed price of
$20.00 per dozen, cash on delivery. During
the first year, Fresh Foods had supplied
Roach Coach with approximately seven
dozen sandwiches per week.

19. On January 15 of the second year, Fresh
Foods was notified of a rise in cost in
production. Bart decided not to supply
Roach Coach with any more sand 
wiches. Roach Coach brings a breach
of contract action against Fresh Foods.
If Fresh Foods argues that the contract
is not binding because it lacks consid 
eration, the court will find for:

D. Roach Coach, because Roach
Coach's agreement to buy all the
sandwiches that they required,
and Fresh Foods' agreement to
supply the same quantity, is suf 
ficient consideration.

20. Assume for this question, that on Janu 
ary 30 of the second year, Bugs pur 
chased two new mobile catering vans.
This caused Roach Coach's sandwich
requirements to escalate to 20 dozen
sandwiches per week. Fresh has refused
to supply Roach Coach with any more
than seven dozen sandwiches per week.
Roach Coach brings a breach of con 
tract action against Fresh Foods. The
court will find for:

A. Fresh Foods, if the normal re 
quirements of the original con 
tract are seven dozen sandwiches
a week.

B. Fresh Foods, because Bug's in 
crease in his requirements was
not contemplated by the parties
at the time of contracting.

A. Fresh Foods, because all con 
tracts must be supported by con 
sideration

C. Roach Coach, because a valid
requirements contract was
formed.

D. Roach Coach, because the pur 
chase of the two mobile catering
vans is a normal expansion.

B. Fresh Foods, because the con

C. Roach Coach, because no con

21. Assume for this question, that in April,
upon doing his taxes, Bugs realized that
he was only netting $12,000.00 a year.
This was primarily because he was only
making a $.10 profit per sandwich.
Bugs decided that the contract price for
the sandwiches was too high and noti 
fied Bart, asking if Bart would lower
the price to $17.00 a dozen. Bart re 
fused. Bugs then decided to sell hot
food only and stop selling sandwiches
altogether. Fresh Foods brings a breach
of contract action against Roach Coach.
The court will find for:

A. Fresh Foods, because Bugs' ac 
tion of not selling sandwiches
was not in good faith.

B. Fresh Foods, because under the
contract an agreement of seven
dozen sandwiches a week was
formed.

C. Roach Coach, because Fresh
Foods refused to lower the price
to $17.00 a dozen when asked.

D. Roach Coach, because a buyer,
under a requirements contract,
can eliminate his requirements
for any reason.

22. Assume that Bugs sells his Roach
Coach business to Ken and, as part of
the sale, assigns all his rights and del 
egates his duties under the Roach
Coach/Fresh Foods agreement to Ken.
Fresh Foods is notified of the sale and
assignment. Fresh Foods refuses to sup

brings an action against Fresh Foods
seeking to be supplied with sandwiches,
what result?

A. Ken will be able to enforce the
Roach Coach/Fresh Food agree

B. Fresh Foods must supply Ken's
requirements in an amount not
unreasonably disproportionate to

Questions 24 - 27 are based on the
following facts:

While in vacation in Colorado, Donald
bought his daughter, Tiffany, a Slick Sled at
Schwartz' Supplies ("Schwartz"). The sled
was manufactured by Hemsley.

Tiffany and her friends took the sled to a
large hill next to Donald's vacation home,
where Tiffany and her friends rode the sled
down the hill many times. Christopher, the
older brother ofTiffany's friend, Suzy, asked
if he could ride the sled down the mountain
and show Tiffany how to maneuver between
the trees. Tiffany handed the sled to Chris 
topher who got onto the sled and started
down the mountain. As he was whipping in
and out between the trees, the metal runner
on the sled snapped, causing Christopher to
fall off the sled and strike his head on a rock.
Christopher suffered severe head injuries
from the accident. Tina, one of Tiffany's
friends, saw the whole incident and became
very ill and severely upset when she wit 
nessed what happened to Christopher.

It was determined that although most sled
manufacturers used steel runners, which is
a much stronger metal than that used by
Hemsley, the use of steel would increase the
manufacturing cost of each sled by about
$2.25.

24. If Christopher brings an action against
Hemsley based on the theory of strict
liability to recover for his injuries:

23. Assume the same facts in question 22,
except that when Bugs sold his Roach
Coach business, Bugs, Bart and Ken all
mutually agree to substitute Ken for
Bugs in the Roach Coach/Fresh Foods
agreement. Ken does not buy all the
sandwich requirements through Fresh
Foods, but rather buys half of his re 
quirements through another sandwich
maker. If Fresh Foods brings an action
against Bugs, the court will find for:

A. Fresh Foods, because it was a
third party beneficiary to the
Bugs/Ken sale agreement.

B. Fresh Foods, because Bugs, the
assignor, is still liable under the
original contract.

C. Bugs, because the sale of Roach
Coach terminated any further
obligations to purchase sand 
wiches from Fresh Foods.

written contract to buy Mr. Ellis' mansion
for $2.5 million. Mr. Trumpery requested to
delay the closing ofthe sale until March 15,
at which time payment was to be made in
exchange for the deed to the property.

47. Assume for this question, that Mr. Ellis
conveys the mansion to Mr. Mapple on
February 15. Mr. Trumpery now wants
to take advantage of Mr. Ellis' convey

out of his contract with Mr. Ellis so that
he may buy a much more modest home
and use the remainder of the money to
quietly retire in Florida. Is Mr. Trum 
pery still obligated to perform his con 
tract with Mr. Ellis?

A. Yes, because Mr. Ellis could still
purchase the property back from
Mr. Mapple and be able to pro 
vide the deed to Mr. Trumpery
on March 15.

B. Yes, because Mr. Ellis is not due
to perform until March 15, which
means there is no breach until
such date, and Mr. Trumpery
must remain ready to perform on
the contract until then.

C. No, if Mr. Ellis did not protect
Mr. Trumpery's rights as part of

Questions 56 - 58 are based on the
following facts:

Bill Brown and his wife, Alicia, had decided
to purchase a larger home because their fam

the ten years they have been married, and
because their income had steadily improved
during the same period of time. After decid 
ing on a spacious custom home in a new
development across town, they both signed
a written contract to buy the home for
$300,000.00 with Cathy, who was the de 
veloper. The contract stated that the Browns
would purchase the home "as long as they
sell their present home for $175,000.00 cash,
and obtain a new loan within the next 90
days."

56. Because the home the Browns intended
to purchase was a bargain price and
because Cathy decided against possi 
bly waiting for 90 days to receive the
sale proceeds, she told the Browns the
sale was off the following day - before
the Browns had even put their present
home up for sale. Mr. and Mrs. Brown
filed a lawsuit against Cathy for breach
of contract, but Cathy raised the defense
that there was no consideration for the
contract. Will she be successful with
this defense?

A. No, because Cathy's promise to
sell the new home was consider 
ation for the Browns' promise to
sell their present home.

B. No, because within the Browns'
promise to buy the home from
Cathy is a condition the Browns
make a good faith effort to find
a buyer for their present home.

C. Yes, because the Browns' prom 
ise to sell their home within 90
days was not within Cathy's nor
the Browns' control.

D. Yes, because the Browns had not
changed their position in reliance
on Cathy's promise to sell.

57. For this question, assume that the
Browns have not put their home on the
market and have refused to purchase the
new home from Cathy. Cathy files a
lawsuit and presents evidence that the
Browns could have found a buyer for
their home who would have paid
$175,000.00 at the close of escrow.
Who will prevail?

A. Cathy, because the condition of
the Browns' promise to sell their
present home at the stated terms
was excused by their refusal to
make it occur\

B. Cathy, because the terms of the
sale of the Browns' home was
not a condition but a promise.

When Cathy sues, the Browns defend
by asserting the parties had orally
agreed that the Browns' obligation to
buy the new home was conditioned
upon the Browns being able to purchase
a small strip of land adjacent to their
property so that there was enough space
to construct a two-car garage for the
home. The written contract was silent

land. The Browns were unsuccessful in
purchasing the adjacent property. When

following facts:

After failing to obtain a promotion to the
level of production manager for The Daily
Planner, the manufacturer of time manage 
ment materials, Jimmy decided to work even
harder in the hopes of earning a future pro 
motion. However, on the day that he learned
that he was not selected for promotion, he
watched as the new production manager,
Clark, left for a workout at the gym with the
plant foreman, Lois, which upset him very
much.

Following Clark and Lois from a distance
to avoid detection, Jimmy watched as Clark
and Lois entered the gym holding hands.
Infuriated, he wanted to scare Clark by driv 
ing his car at him at full speed, then tum
away suddenly once he was close to Clark.

73. When Jimmy drove his car at Clark,
Clark was able to jump out of the path
of the vehicle, except for Clark's gym
bag that was knocked out of his hand
when it was struck by the front fender
of Jimmy's car. Which crimes did
Jimmy commit?

A. Attempted murder, assault with
a deadly weapon, and battery.

74. If Clark was struck and killed by
Jimmy's car, what is the most serious
crime of which Jimmy will be con

A. Involuntary manslaughter.

B. Voluntary manslaughter.

C. Second degree murder.

D. First degree murder.

intentionally ran over Lois believing
that if he did not get the promotion,
neither should Lois. Unknown to him,
Lois was pregnant with Clark's baby.
Although Lois survived, the baby did
not. Will Jimmy be found guilty if
charged with homicide of the baby?

A. Yes, of first degree murder since

he intended to kill Lois.

B. Yes, of involuntary manslaugh

Questions 76 - 79 are based on the
following facts:

D. No, because she materially mis 
represented the car's condition.

As Ruth approached her eighteenth birthday,
she decided to sell the car she has owned
since her sixteenth birthday. Although
Sandra is 10 years older than Ruth, she is
buying her first car. Sandra takes Ruth's car
for a test drive. Sandra notices that the car
bounces and vibrates severely at freeway
speeds, but is told by Ruth that the vibration
merely means the tires need to be balanced.
What Ruth failed to tell Sandra (and which
was known to Ruth) is that the vibration was
from worn shocks and a bent frame, which
are costly to repair. Sandra agrees to buy the
car for $2,500, and signs an agreement that,
in part, states she will pay Ruth and pick up
the car the following Friday. Sandra contacts
a car repair shop to set an appointment for
tire balancing, only to learn the true nature
and cost of the problem.

76.

If Ruth sues Sandra for breach of con 
tract, because Sandra refuses to follow
through with the purchase, will Ruth
prevail?

A. Yes, because only Ruth can void
the contract based upon Ruth's
infancy.

B. Yes, because Sandra's reliance
on Ruth's representations were
unreasonable.

C. No, because the contract is void 
able due to Ruth's incapacity to
contract.

77. Assume for this question only, that
Sandra told Ruth that she knew the
shocks were worn and that visible body
damage indicated the frame was bent,
but she agreed to purchase the car any 
way. After agreeing to the sale, Ruth
decides to keep the car. Sandra sues
Ruth to enforce the terms of the con 
tract. Will Sandra prevail?

A. Yes, because any claim that Ruth
misrepresented the condition of
the car would be unreasonable.

B. Yes, because Sandra is estopped

to avoid the contract.

C. No, because Ruth may avoid the
contract because she is a minor.

D. No, because a contract based on
a material misrepresentation is

"Ruth II" was $2,500.

79. Assume the same facts as in the pre

knew of the transcription error by Ruth
at the time their agreement was reduced
to writing. Although Sandra requests
delivery of "Ruth II," Ruth refuses.
Sandra files a breach of contract action
against Ruth seeking to enforce the
agreement as written. Who will prevail?

A. Sandra, because the Parol Evi 
dence Rule bars evidence of the
misidentification of the car Ruth
had put up for sale.

B. Sandra, because the unilateral
mistake was not known to exist
by Ruth.

C. Ruth, because there was no
agreement to sell "Ruth II" to
Sandra.

D. Ruth, because there was a mu 

tual mistake.

78. Assume for this question that Ruth had
two cars, each with personalized license
plates. The car for sale had plates stat

"Ruth II". Assume the written agree 
ment between Ruth and Sandra purports
to identify the car by license number,
and Ruth enters "Ruth II" where the li 
cense number information is requested.
The error is not noticed until Sandra is
to take delivery of the car. Ruth deliv 
ers the "Ruth I" vehicle to Sandra, who
refuses to accept it. Because she only
needs one car, Ruth returns with "Ruth
II" and tenders it to Sandra, who refuses
to accept delivery of it as well. The
"Ruth II" vehicle is the same year,
make, and model of the "Ruth I" car,
but without the defects. If Ruth sues
Sandra for her refusal to accept "Ruth
II," who will prevail?

A. Sandra, because the Parol Evi 
dence Rule does not bar evidence
that Sandra never agreed to pur 
chase "Ruth II."

B. Sandra, because a written agree 
ment entered on the basis of
fraudulent representations fails
to satisfy the Statute of Frauds,
and is thereby voidable.

C. Ruth, because the Parol Evi

that "Ruth II" was not the actual

following facts:

A. No, because he did not intend

that Nat perform the act.

Sam is a private detective who often crosses
the line of the law when conducting investi-
gations for his clients, but he is well-paid
and frequently sought out for this reason.
Because Sam was going out of town on a
case, and a client needed quick results, Sam
attempted to contact Nick, another private
detective who was unafraid of performing
the same types of investigations as Sam, to
perform the necessary work.

Sam left a note intended for Nick, of Nick
and Nat Detective Agency, stating that he
would have to break and enter the local
prosecutor's office and recover a handgun
tying Sam's client to a string of murders, but
that care should be taken during the job to
avoid detection by, and injury to, anybody
who might discover the break-in activity.
Despite the brutality of the crimes and large
amount of press coverage, the prosecutor
kept the gun in a shoebox on a shelf in his
office. Instead of being found by Nick, the
note was found by Nat, who also knew Sam
and who thought the note was intended for
him. That evening, Nat broke into the
prosecutor's office to retrieve the gun. As
Nat was obtaining the handgun, he was dis-
covered by the janitor. Nat used a non-le-

93. Assume the same facts as Question 92,
except that Priscilla asserts the defense
that there was not adequate consider 
ation for her promise to pay $1,499.00.

further sale.

B. No, because Mitch's promise to
tender the couch upon receipt of
the $1,499.00 was sufficient con

Although Priscilla received the invoice,
she had changed her mind about the

ANSWERS

1. C is the correct answer. Art was under
a pre-existing duty to construct the
home as agreed. Although the tiles
would be difficult to obtain, Art's per 
formance will not be excused under the
doctrine of unanticipated circum 
stances. A, Band D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in answer C.

2. A is the correct answer. Though Bob's
act of meeting with the IRS and reach 
ing a favorable resolution for Art may
have resulted in Art's promise, the
promise was not supported by any con 
sideration. Thus, Bob's promise to in 
stall a Genie door raiser for Art is purely
gratuitous and is unenforceable. B is
incorrect because the parole evidence
rule only applies when a full, complete
integrated written contract is entered
into between the parties. C is incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer A. D is
incorrect because promissory estoppel
is triggered when a gratuitous promise
is likely to, and does, induce the prom 
isee to rely. Here, the facts state that
Art's promise followed Bob's act; there 
fore, Bob was not induced by the prom 
ise.

3. D is the correct answer. Where a con 
tract contains gaps in the terms to be
performed, the court will ordinarily fill
in such gaps by implication, e.g., requir 
ing a garage door opener of the power
rating that is reasonably required. Al 
though Art refused to install the more
powerful motor, he is entitled to pay 
ment of the contract price for his sub 
stantial performance, less Bob's dam 
ages for Art's failure to install the ap 
propriate motor.

4. C is the correct answer. When a par 
tially constructed home is destroyed
accidentally, through no fault of the
parties to the contract, the party con 
structing the home cannot recover for
the work, including material and labor
that was destroyed, because no benefit
has been conferred upon the owner.
Therefore, Art may not recover for pre 
viously completed work. A and Bare
incorrect for the reasons stated for an 
swer C. D is incorrect because the duty
of a contractor to perform on time may
be excused by destruction of the home.

5. A is the correct answer. An express con 
dition that performance must be to the
satisfaction of a third person requires
that the third person's decision be hon 
est and in good faith. However, where
the third person's dissatisfaction is a
gross mistake, the condition of personal
satisfaction will be excused. B, C and
D are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer A.

SIMULATED BAR Ell

6. C is the correct answer. Where a plain 
tiff in default (here, University is stand 
ing in Art's shoes as plaintiff) sues to
recover damages, the plaintiff's recov 
ery is measured by the amount of
defendant's enrichment, but not more
than the contract price. A, Band Dare

9. C is the correct answer. Plaintiff may
recover damages for severe emotional
distress caused by observing the negli 
gently inflicted injury of a third person
if, but only if, plaintiff is closely related
to the injured victim, present at the
scene of the injury-producing event at

plaintiff suffering serious emotional
distress. A and B are incorrect for the
reasons stated in answer C. D is incor 
rect because for negligent infliction,
foreseeability is not an element of the
tort.

10. C is the correct answer. A conspiracy is
an agreement between two or more per 
sons to do an unlawful act. Because
Max did not willingly agree to perform
the robbery, but was under the compul 
sion of duress, there was not an agree 
ment between Siegfried and Max such
that it amounted to a conspiracy. A, B,
and D are incorrect because C is cor 
rect.

7. D is the correct answer. False impris 
onment requires a showing of physical
or psychological confinement of an 
other who is conscious of or injured by
the confinement. Because Milton was
not aware of his confinement since he

11. B is the correct answer. The defense of
duress applies where the conduct of
another caused the defendant to reason 
ably believe that, unless he committed
the crime, he or a third person would

defense of duress applies here because
Siegfried threatened to blow up the
briefcase attached to Max's arm, which
if filled with explosives would most
likely result in his death. Max's reason

the contract does not lack mutuality

38. B is the correct answer. Under the
"mailbox rule," where the use of U.S.
mail, telegram, or overnight mail ser 
vices is a reasonable method of com 
municating an acceptance, such accep 
tance is generally effective upon dis 
patch and a revocation is generally ef 
fective upon receipt. Thus, even though
Jay received Conan's attempted revo 
cation before Conan received Jay's ac 
ceptance, a contract was formed. Note
that although an offer may invite accep 
tance by either a promise or an act, and
on its face Conan's offer arguably con 
tains language that invites acceptance
by performance, a reasonable interpre 
tation of Conan's offer was that he re 
quired to be contacted prior to Sunday
for acceptance. A is incorrect because
the method of revocation is generally
not limited to the same method as the
communication method of the offer. C
is incorrect because Jay's normal fee
can be objectively determined. D is in 
correct because a request using such
language as "I wish" or "I hope" is con 
sidered to be mere inquiry.

39. A is the correct answer. An offer is an
outward manifestation of present will 
ingness to enter into a bargain, made in
such a way that the person to whom it
is addressed reasonably believes that he
could accept the offer by assenting to

Although such ignorance/mistaken be

63. The best answer is C. Conversion is the
intentional exercise of dominion and
control over the chattel of another.
When a bailee receives possession of
the chattel of another and uses the chat 
tel in such a way as to materially breach
the scope of his authority over the chat 
teL a conversion has occurred. When
Columbo's coat when presented with
the ticket, a material breach of his au 
thority, and, therefore, a conversion, had
occurred. A is incorrect because waiver
does not apply as a defense under the
facts given. B is incorrect because
where the defendant intends to deal with
the chattel in the manner in which re 
sulted in the loss of the coat, even if he
did not consciously commit a wrong 
doing (permit theft or gave the chattel
to the wrong person), he is liable for
conversion. The Lieutenant is vicari 
ously liable for the coat clerk's conduct.
D is incorrect because it merely ad 
dresses the amount of recoverable dam 
ages.

64. B is the correct answer. An owner or
occupier of land has the duty to inspect
and discover any dangerous conditions
or activities on the land, and to correct
or warn of such conditions or activities.
However, the question asks about the
liability of David, who is not the land
owner or occupier. Since this answer is
the only one given that addresses a pos 
sible situation in which David could be
held liable, it is the only possible cor 
rect answer. A is incorrect because
Chaulky's mother does not have the
same duty as the owner or occupier of
land because of her status as parent of
a minor child. C and D are incorrect for
the reasons stated for answer B.

65. D is the correct answer. A manufacturer
of a product may be held liable for its
negligence which results in its product
being unreasonably dangerous. A manu 
facturer of a defective product is also
strictly liable to consumers and users
for injuries caused by the defect. How 
ever, a manufacturer is not liable under
a premises liability theory ("abnormally
dangerous condition") for defects in a
product. A, Band C are incorrect for
the reasons stated.

66. B is the correct answer. In cases involv 
ing a "thin skull" plaintiff, all courts will
hold defendant liable for the full extent
of plaintiff's damages, under the ratio 
nale that a defendant takes the plaintiff
as he finds him. Therefore, defendant(s)
will be liable for the actual amount of
lost income resulting from his inability
to complete the film. A is an incorrect
statement of the law. C is incorrect be 
cause the loss of earnings to Chaulky
has no relationship to a shortened
lifespan. D is an incorrect statement of
the law.

67. B is the correct answer. Generally, a
defendant who is only secondarily li 
able for plaintiff's damages is entitled
to indemnification, for the amount of
any judgment paid, against the party
primarily responsible for plaintiff's
damages. However, indemnity is also
available where defendants are directly
liable to plaintiff, but there is a great
degree of difference between the cul 
pability of the liable parties. Since this
answer attributes active negligence
against the premises owner, Late Night,
it is not entitled to recover any amount
of the judgment paid. A and C are in 
correct statements of the law, because
they do not permit the existence of any
exceptions to the purported rules given.
D is incorrect because it fails to recog 
nize the principles of contribution and
indemnity.

70. A is the best answer because there is an
agreement between Batman and Robin
to commit the unlawful act of robbery.
This is a question which does not offer
a correct answer. Conspiracy does not
require action on the part of all co-con 
spirators, nor does it require comple 
tion of the crime. Thus, we are left with
choices A and B. A is the better answer
because it is more relevant to this fact
pattern. Wharton's Rule only concerns
those crimes which, by definition, re 
quire multiple perpetrators. Robbery is
not such a crime. C and D are incorrect

68. C is the correct answer. An accessory
after the fact is a person who receives,
comforts, or assists another to avoid
arrest, prosecution, or conviction,
knowing that the other has committed
a felony. Since Ben knew of the theft
(and in fact was paid for his services
out of the spoils of the theft), and was
acting to avoid Bonnie and Clyde's ar 
rest, he is guilty of being an accessory
after the fact. A is incorrect because a
principal in the first degree is someone
who actually commits the crime by his
acts, or through the acts of an innocent
person or inanimate agent. B is incor 
rect because a principal in the second
degree is someone who incites or abets
the commission of the crime, and is
actually or constructively present at the
scene of the crime. D is incorrect be 
cause of the reasons stated for the cor 
rect answer.

69. C is the correct answer. Robbery is the
trespassory taking and carrying away
of the personal property of another,
from the person or their presence, by
force or threat of force, with the intent
to permanently deprive. All elements
must be present. Here, there was no tak 
ing (cont!:2.!2 of the property-so th;;re
was no robbery. A is mcorrect because
it addresses only one element of the
crime. B is an incorrect statement of
law-the threat can be to third parties. D
is not the best answer because it is bet 
ter to choose an answer which elimi 
nates an element of the actus reas than
an answer which raises a possible de 
fense of duress.

73. The correct answer is C. Generally, an
assault with a deadly weapon is inten-

covery for damages, the interference
must result in substantial and unreason 
able harm in the use and enjoyment of
realty, which is the rule set forth in the
correct answer. A is incorrect because a
violation of the ordinance does not nec 
essarily constitute a nuisance. C is in 
correct because Dan and Roseanne did
not come to the nuisance. The noise and
crowds did not occur until after they
moved in. D is an incorrect statement
of the law in that actual trespass is not
required for recovery under a private
nuisance theory.

through the use of an instrumentality
calculated to cause severe harm or
death. A battery is the intentional and
unlawful application of force to another
person. Since Jimmy intentionally
drove at Clark with his car (the deadly
weapon), only to have Clark jump out
of the way, Jimmy is guilty of the as 
sault with a deadly weapon. Although
Jimmy did not strike the actual person
of Clark, striking and knocking an ob 
ject out of Clark's hand is sufficient to
constitute a battery. Attempted murder
is the specific intent to kill coupled with
an act in perpetration to complete the
killing. The facts are absent any indi 
cation that Jimmy intended to kill Clark.
Based on the explanation, A, B, and D
are incorrect.

76 . D is the correct answer. Where one party
to a contract has made a material mis 
representation regarding the subject of
the contract, the contract is voidable by
the innocent party. Since Ruth's state 
ment regarding the defects in her car
were likely to induce Sandra (or a rea 
sonable person) to purchase the car, the
misrepresentation is material. A is in 
correct because it reaches the wrong
conclusion and the contract can be
avoided on grounds other than infancy.
B is incorrect because Sandra's reliance
was reasonable since no facts suggest
that Sandra should have known of the
misrepresentation, and because it was
to be her first car purchase - which in 
dicates lack of sophistication. C is in 
correct because minors may enter into
a contract. The contract is merely void 
able, but may be enforceable if the mi 
nor chooses not to avoid it.

77. C is the correct answer. A contract en 
tered into by a minor is voidable at the
minor's choice, even though the minor
may enforce the contract against an
adult. Since Ruth is a minor and has
stated that she wants to avoid the con 
tract, the contract is not enforceable in
favor of Sandra. A and B are incorrect
because these answers are couched in
language as if Sandra seeks to avoid the
contract, and because of the incorrect
conclusion of enforceability. D is incor 
rect because a contract based on mate 
rial fraudulent representations is merely
voidable.

74. C is the correct answer. D is incorrect
because first degree murder is the pre 
meditated intentional killing of a human
being, or via felony-murder. Here, since
Jimmy only intended to scare Clark,
there was no specific intent to kill with
premeditation or deliberation. Further,
felony-murder cannot be used when the
underlying felony involves an attack on
the person, such as the facts indicate
here. (This is called the merger rule).
~econd degree murder requires, essen 
tially, either an intent to kill, or a reck-
less kjlling- such as these facts indi-
cate. Voluntary manslaughter, choice B,
is a killing that would be murder ex 
cept for the fact it was committed with
adequate provocation thereby mitigat 
ing the defendant's culpability. There
was no reasonable provocation here.

75. D is the correct answer. For purposes
of criminal homicide, unless the victim
is a living human being, there can be
no homicide. However, most courts do
not recognize that a viable living fetus

killing of the fetus would be homicide.

78. A is the correct answer. Parol evidence
is admissible to show the existence a
mistake in the transcription of the terms
of an oral agreement that was subse 
quently reduced to writing, where the
terms of the agreement were not cor 
rectly transcribed to reflect the agree 
ment of the parties. Since Ruth and
Sandra agreed that Sandra would pur 
chase "Ruth I," parol evidence that
Sandra did not agree to purchase "Ruth
II" is admissible. B is incorrect because
the error in transcription was not be 
cause of any fraud and because it is any
incorrect rule of law. C is an incorrect
rule of law. D is incorrect because
Sandra is not required to purchase
"Ruth II" as set forth in the explanation
for answer A.

79. C is the correct answer. As stated in the
answer to question 78, parol evidence
is admissible under the circumstances
to prove that the parties oral agreement
was transcribed incorrectly when it was
reduced to a writing. A is incorrect be 
cause of the reason answer C is correct.
B is incorrect because where only one
party knows that a mistake has been
made, that party cannot snap up an of 
fer that was made in mistake. D is in 
correct because it misstates the facts;
there was no mutual mistake.

80. A is the correct answer. Since a party to
a contract is entitled to receive the ben 
efit of his bargain, where the other party
to the contract induces the injured party
to enter the contract by making fraudu 
lent representations, the injured party
is entitled to recover his damages to the
extent there is a difference between
what he was offered and what he re 
ceived. B is not held to a reasonable
discovery standard where his reliance
was obtained by fraud. C and D are in

84. A is the correct answer. Implied as 
sumption of risk will be a defense where
plaintiff was actually aware of the par 
ticular risk involved and voluntarily
encountered the known risk. Since Skip
must have had actual knowledge of the
particular risk, the defense will not ap 
ply because he had no such knowledge.
B is incorrect because a minor may as 
sume the risk where he fully appreci 
ates the risks involved. C is incorrect
because the test is not an objective, but
a subjective, standard. D is incorrect
because it addresses the reasonableness
of Skip's conduct, not whether he vol 
untarily encountered a known risk.

85. A is the correct answer. Where defen 
dant counsels, incites or induces another
to commit or join in the commission of
a crime, he is guilty of solicitation.
However, where the solicitation is di 
rected to a specific person, but defen 
dant did not intend to solicit the person
who actually received the communica 
tion, there is no crime of solicitation as
to the person (Nat) who received such
communication.

cerns whether Skip acted reasonably in
light of the presence of the ice. Choice
II concerns the swiftness with which
medical care is required and the reason 
ableness of acting hastily when sum 
moning such medical care. Choice III

tain the gun at Sam's request, a con 
spiracy was formed. A and C are incor 
rect because there was no intent to agree

D is the correct answer. A defendant will
be liable under the theory of vicarious
liability for the crimes committed by
another person when such is within the
scope of a solicitation or conspiracy. In
such instance, causation is established.
Although this is a close call, since it was
stipulated the spray was non-lethal and
since a different party carried out the
plan, D is, nevertheless, the best choice.
A and B are incorrect for the same rea 
sons that D is correct. C is incorrect

92. C is the correct answer. The Statute of
Frauds requires that a contract for the
sale of goods for $500.00 or more must
be in writing, signed by the party to be
charged, to be enforceable. One excep 
tion to this rule is when both parties are
merchants, and one party sends the
other party a written confirmation
which satisfies the Statute of Frauds as
to the sender, and the party receiving
the confirmation does not send a writ 
ten objection within 10 days (U.e.e. 2 
201). Since Priscilla is not a merchant,
and she did not sign any writing evi 
dencing the terms of the contract, the
contract is unenforceable. A and Bare
incorrect for the reasons C is correct. D

cable law.

93. B is the correct answer. Again, the court
ordinarily will not evaluate the ad 
equacy of consideration between par 
ties, as long as the contract is not un 
conscionable. Arguably, payment of
$1,499.00 for a couch valued at
$15,000.00 is not unconscionable such
that the contract is lacking sufficient
consideration. A is incorrect because
there are no facts evidencing detrimen 
tal reliance (such as the loss of a sale of
the subject couch) whereby promissory
estoppel would apply. C is incorrect for
the same reason that B is correct. D is
factually correct, but reaches the wrong
conclusion on the issue of adequacy of
consideration.

90. A is the correct answer. Defamation of
a public person is constitutionally privi 
leged, unless published with knowledge
of falsity or reckless disregard of the
truth. Since this answer presumes that
Tawnya used reasonable care in inves 
tigating Lee, her conduct is not such that
it violated the constitutional standard of
knowing falsity or reckless disregard for
the truth. B is incorrect because Tawnya
will be liable, despite her belief in the
truth, if she exhibited a reckless disre 
gard for the truth. C is incorrect because
the defamation has already occurred,
and a retraction is usually only effec 
tive in limiting general, but not special,
damages. D is incorrect because it sets
forth the incorrect standard for liabil 
ity.

91. B is the correct answer. The general rule
is that an advertisement is not an offer
because it is usually too indefinite and
is construed as an invitation to deal.
Since Mitch's ad did not specify which
couches were offered at the $299.00
price, the ad could not be construed to
invite acceptance to purchase the higher
quality couch at the sale price. A is in 
correct because consideration is not
normally reviewed by the courts for
adequacy as long as the contract is not
unconscionable. It is unlikely the court
would find it unconscionable to pay
$299.00 for a couch listed at $1,499.00,
particularly since no value ofthe higher
quality couch is given in the facts. C

94. D is the best answer. Where perfor 
mance of a contract becomes illegal as
a result of a supervening change in the

the promisor's performance is excused.

the couch and Priscilla is not obligated

ment is enforceable under contract law.
Therefore, Bob may bring an action to

Lawyer Breebar has just passed and been
admitted to the bar, after having failed it
three times prior. Breebar decides to set up
his own personal injury practice, even
though he has virtually no experience in this
area.

Breebar rents office space, hires a secretary
and places advertisements. Soon thereafter
Client Herb calls Breebar regarding an auto
accident case. The case seems relatively
straightforward, so Breebar accepts the rep 
resentation. However, the more Breebar
looks into the facts, the more confused he
becomes.

Months pass. Herb calls Breebar repeatedly,
but Breebar does not return his phone calls.
Instead Breebar consoles himself by hang

Lawyer Rob represents Client Loon. Loon
is charged with the statutory offense of
"Driving an Automobile while under the
Influence of Alcohol." Rob has performed
an excellent job. He has investigated the ar 
resting officer, has had an expert examine
the breathalyzer test utilized by the police,
and has assembled a host of witnesses indi 
cating that Loon is personally against the use
of all drugs, including alcohol. However,
there is one problem. Loon talks with a slight
lisp and tends to be snide when he is ques 
tioned. Rob, therefore, decides that Loon
must not take the stand in his own defense.
Loon insists that he be so allowed. The trial
ends with Loon fully acquitted - even though
he does not take the stand.

17. Should Rob have let Loon take the

stand?

A. Yes, because this is an area of

client decision.

B. Yes, because a client's funda

Q     

Questions 21 — 30 are based on the
following facts:   

Lawyer Linda is in practice in a large city.
She charges $10,000 to go to trial on a charge
of drunk driving. She requires this money
be paid up front. Linda has been in practice
for 15 years and enjoys a fine reputation in
the community. Fifty miles outside of the
city Lawyer Chip does the same work for
$2,000. Linda seals her client contracts with
a handshake, only. Chip always commits his
contracts to writing. 

On one occasion, Client Bingo sought the
services of Linda. Linda refused because
Bingo could not afford the $10,000. Bingo
then sought the services of Chip. Bingo told
Chip that he could not afford even $2,000.
Chip felt sorry for Bingo and agreed to de-
fend him against the charge of drunk driv-
ing "for $500 now and if you are acquitted
you can pay me $1500 when you are able."
Bingo is convicted and Chip does not bill
him for the $1500.

A short time later, Client Moxy seeks the
services of Linda. Linda decides to repre-
sent Moxy against a drunk driving charge
for only $1000. Linda does this because
Moxy is hard-pressed to find the money.

After the Bingo case, Client Rex comes in
to see Chip, with a similar problem. Because
Rex is wealthy and because Chip is having
a cash-flow problem, Chip decides to bill
Rex $5000 for the defense. This fee is not
unusual for Chip's community, but it is the
first time Chip has set his billing so high.

PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 377

Unfortunately, the Rex case turns out to be
highly complex. Chip calls Linda to see if
she is willing to help out. Linda agrees, as
does Rex. The fee is not raised and the cli 
ent agrees to this arrangement in writing.
Chip and Linda spend equal time on Rex's
case and split the fee equally.

jects her to possible discipline.

B.

C.

Is probably not excessive and
thus is proper.

D. I, II, III, IV and V.

23. Linda's method of sealing her contracts

with a handshake only is:

A. In violation of the rules.

B. Proper, but not preferred.

C. Proper, and preferred.

D. Improper.

24. Linda's refusal to represent Bingo:

A. Is proper because rarely are at-
torneys required to accept cli-
ents.

B.

Is in technical violation of the
rules.

C. Depends on whether this juris-

same amounts.

II. Subjects each of them to

performed.

C. Yes, because Rex did not consent

someone to kill Sprout."

Alfalfa tells Kibbles, "Do not do that. It will
only make your problems worse."

Kibbles responds, "Perhaps so, but I'm get

I mean it."

Alfalfa does nothing, and unfortunately
Sprout is murdered, apparently by Kibbles.

31. Which of the following is most correct?

A. Alfalfa is subject to discipline,

lIB PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTY

3. A is the correct answer. Judges must
refrain from criticisms of jurors and
must also refrain from ex parte confer 
ences absent exigencies (and there was
no exigency here). CJC 3B(7)(a);
3B(lO). Judges must maintain de 
meanor and professionalism. Criticism
of any party absent their misconduct
destroys that professionalism. Further,
under our adversary system, ex parte
conferences are believed to create not
only an appearance of impropriety but
actual impropriety in that the other ad 
vocate does not have a chance to de 
fend his or her position. B, C and Dare
incorrect for the same reasons that A is
correct.

4. C is the correct answer. A judge who
must seek reelection is permitted to
promise impartiality. He or she is not
permitted to promise a result in a spe 
cific case. CJC 5A(3)(d)(i). A and Dare
incorrect for the same reasons that C is
correct. B is incorrect because although
a judge is granted certain first amend 
ment freedom of speech protection, this
radical promise is beyond the first
amendment freedom allowed.

PROFESSIONAL
RESPONSIBILITY
ANSWERS

1. D is the correct answer. A judge, even
with another judge's approval, is not
permitted to be a character witness. See,
ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct
[CJC] 2B. As such, a judge has unnec 
essarily put him or herself in a position
of appearing biased or prejudiced and
has placed him or herself in a role more
of a lay citizen. A is incorrect under the
ABA Code because not all judicial rules
are discretionary. B is incorrect because
consent of a superior does not relieve a
lawyer or a judge from personal respon 
sibilities. C is incorrect because judges
certainly can be disciplined.

2. C is the correct answer. CJC 4C(2) in 
dicates that it is improper for a sitting
judge to serve on a government com 
mission. Although the prestige of the
judge's position will add weight to the
credibility of the commission, again this
is thought to be a compromise of judi 
cial impartiality. A, though arguably
giving a correct statement of interpre 
tation, is incorrect because the rules are
to the contrary. B is incorrect because
the mere fact that the judge is not paid
does not relieve the judge of his or her
ethical responsibility. D is incorrect
because serving on such a commission
is not, per se, undignified.

PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBIUTY II

5. D is the correct answer. Advertisements
must not be misleading. ABA Model
Rules of Professional Conduct Model
Rule [MR] 7.1; ABA Model Code of
Professional Responsibility, Disciplin 
ary Rule [DR] 2-101. Since a statement
that a lawyer has never lost a case, even
if true, is misleading - since it sets up
an unreasonable expectation regarding
cases which no lawyer could win;
Quinn's ad is in violation of the rules.
A and B are incorrect because lawyer
advertising is given limited First
Amendment protection. C is incorrect
because there is no requirement, as yet,
that lawyer ads appear in a dignified
forum. Such is, of course, preferable,
but it is not mandatory.

6. C is the correct answer. Lawyers must
not lie on their bar applications. Such
shows a lack of good character, which
subjects an attorney to discipline. MR
8.1; DR 1-101(A). Discipline is not for
the purpose of punishment. Rather, it is
to protect the public from dangerously
inept or corrupt attorneys. Moreover,
there are no statutes of limitations re 
garding disciplining attorneys. Thus, C
is correct and A and D are incorrect. B
is incorrect because it is permissible to
discipline an attorney for past acts un 
related to her present psychological
state.

7. C is the correct answer. A lawyer must
turn in his delinquent peers provided
what they know is unprivileged. MR
8.3(a); DR 1-103(A). Thus, C is cor 
rect and A and B are incorrect. D is in 
correct for two reasons: first Joe is not
in good faith and second, good faith is
not an excuse for this kind of violation.
(Note: California has no like require 
ment.)

8. D is the correct answer. A state can dis 
cipline a lawyer for actions performed
anywhere, if such actions involve moral
turpitude. Since manslaughter is mor 
ally wrong, discipline is acceptable. MR
8.4; MR 8.5; DR 1-102(A)(3). There 
fore, D is correct and A and B are in 
correct. C is incorrect because the ac 
tions of moral turpitude need not be di 
rectly related to the practice of law.

9. A is the correct answer. Judges should
not be character witnesses. Such ap 
pears improper. CJC 2B. Therefore A
is correct and D is incorrect. B is incor 
rect because judges may on occasion
be required to testify, e.g., if they are a
party to their own litigation. C is incor 
rect because Slip's good or bad charac 
ter is not the issue. The issue is whether
the judge is permitted to testify.

10. B is the correct answer. Ex parte com 
munications between a judge and juror
are not preferable. If such occur, all
parties to the litigation should be given
notice. CJC 3B. Thus, B is correct and
A, C and D are incorrect.

m:I PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTV

11. C is the correct answer because only
choice I is correct. Ajudge is permitted
to teach law and be paid. Thus, II and
III are incorrect and I is correct. How 
ever, judges should make a public re 
port of their extra judicial income. CJC
4B,H.

12. C is the correct answer. Judges are per 
mitted to manage and participate in a
business primarily engaged in invest 
ment of the judge's financial resources.
Thus, C is correct and A and B are in 
correct. D is incorrect because the busi 
ness can be related to law, e.g., law
teaching. CJC 4D.

13. C is the correct answer. Judges are per 
mitted to receive gifts related to ordi 
nary hospitality such as birthday pre 
sents. Only when the gift creates an
appearance of impropriety should it be
refused. CJC 4D. A, Band D are, there 
fore, incorrect and C is correct. (Note:
the call of this question is phrased in
the negative.)

14. A is the correct answer. Judges, when
campaigning for office, generally
should not make pledges regarding the
way they would sentence CJC SA.
However, the first amendment is appli 
cable to judges - so judges can take a
"law and order" stance. Thus, B is in 
correct. C is incorrect because ample
facts were given. D is incorrect because
the first amendment controls.

15. C is the correct answer. Passing the bar
exam, on its face, is proof of reason 
able competence. Perhaps where the
law is complex, a new lawyer could not
begin practice in that area. But in any
general area of law, new lawyers are
permitted to start right out. MR 1.1; DR
6-10 1. A is incorrect for the same rea 
son that C is correct. B is incorrect be 
cause no facts indicate that Breebar is
actually incompetent. D is incorrect
because no facts indicate that Breebar
is actually competent.

16. A is the correct answer. Lawyers must
neither neglect cases nor neglect their
clients. MR 1.3; DR 6-101(A)(3);
American Bar Association Model Code
of Professional Responsibility Ethical
Consideration [EC] 6-4. Not returning
client calls for months, as stipulated
here, is just cause for discipline. B is
obviously incorrect because lawyers are
free to discontinue their practice of law.
C is incorrect because the issue of in 
jury to the client is more an issue of tort
(malpractice) liability. There need be no
client prejudice for discipline to follow.
D is incorrect because, although it is
permissible for a lawyer to discontinue
the practice of law, he must take rea 
sonable steps to insure that his clients
are well taken care of. Breebar just
"goofed off."

PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY Em

17. A is the correct answer. As a general
rule, strategy is entirely within a
lawyer's discretion. There are, however,
certain fundamental choices which are
entirely to be made by the client.
Whether or not to take the stand is one
of those areas. MR 1.2(a); EC 7-7. Thus,
Rob should have let Loon testify. Here
the Model Rules require that the attor 
ney abide by the client's wishes regard 
ing whether or not to testify. (Under the
old Model Code, it is discretionary.) B
is incorrect because if a client disagrees
as to strategy, the lawyer may follow
his own decisions and desires. Coffers
a correct analysis of what the jury might
think regarding a defendant's silence.
But C is incorrect because the real is 
sue is not what the jury will think - it is
who gets to make the decision. D is in 
correct for the same reasons that A is
correct.

18. C is the correct answer. A lawyer must
not make use of perjured testimony. MR
3.3(a)(4); DR 7-102(A)(4.) Rob not
only makes use of the testimony - he
also aids in the fraud on the court. A
and D are incorrect for the same reason
that C is correct. B is incorrect because
a technical violation of the mandatory
rules subjects an attorney to discipline.
Of course, if it is merely a technical vio 
lation, the discipline will probably be
light, e.g., private reprimand only.

19. C is the correct answer. There is noth 
ing in the code which prohibits a law 
yer from charging low fees. To the con 
trary, lawyers are encouraged to com 
pete and to do work for free. MR 6.1;
EC 2-25. Thus, Epsilon's behavior is
within his own discretion and is, thus,
"proper." Choices A, Band D are in 
correct for the same reasons that C is
correct.

20. B is the correct answer, because choices
I and II are correct. Choice I is correct
because there is an exception to the rule
barring solicitation of clients when the
solicitation concerns a related matter to
which the lawyer had previously per 
formed work. MR 7.3; DR2-104(A)(1).
Choice II is correct because when a cli 
ent is to be prejudiced, the best course
of conduct is for the attorney to initiate
contact with that former client (on the
related matter). MR 1.3. Choice III is
incorrect because, although lawyers
"should" contact clients in like situa 
tions; such is within their discretion  
unless, of course, they tell the client that
they will periodically inspect the legal
document.

21. B is the correct answer. For the most
part, attorneys can set their own fees
which are permitted to be substantial,
within the broad parameters of reason 
ableness. MR 1.5; DR 2-106. A and D
are incorrect because although exces 
sive fees will subject an attorney to dis 
cipline, this fee was likely not exces 
sive. C is incorrect because attorney
fees must be reasonable.

Em PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTV

22. C is the correct answer, because choices
I, II, III and IV are correct. I is correct
because expertise is a factor in whether
the attorney fee is excessive v. reason 
able. II is correct because the attorney's
fame (reputation) is another legitimate
factor. III is obviously correct, because
the more difficult is the case, the higher
the fee can be. IV is correct because,
although not completely controlling, the
fees of similarly situated attorneys is
relevant in adjudging whether a particu 
lar attorney's fee is excessive. Choice
V is incorrect because Chip, a small
town attorney, is not similarly situated
to Linda. Thus, his fees are not relevant.
See generally MR 1.5; DR 2-106(A).

23. B is the correct answer. Although it is
preferable to reduce contracts with new
clients to writing, such is not manda 
tory. MR 1.5(b); EC 2-19. A, C and D
are incorrect for the same reasons that
B is correct. (Note: California law re 
quires fees of $1000 or over generally
be put in writing; the MPRE does not
test California law.)

24. A is the correct answer. Nothing in the
ABA code requires an attorney to ac 
cept all walk-in clients. Thus, Band C
are incorrect. D is incorrect because
nothing in the code requires an attor 
ney to bill all clients the same amount
for similar work. The fees need only be
reasonable - but not equal. MR 1.5; DR
2-106; EC 2-17. Such is obviously the
case because attorneys are encouraged
to perform some legal work for the poor
for no charge. MR 6.1; EC 2-25.

25. D is the correct answer. Allowing Bingo
to pay an additional $1500 only ifhe is
acquitted is essentially a contingency
fee contract. Contingency fee contracts
in criminal cases are per se prohibited.
MR 1.5(d)(2); DR 2-106(C). Chip's
good faith is no defense - thus, A and
B are incorrect. C is incorrect because
there is no Leon case relevant here.
(Note: California law does not, per se,
prohibit such an arrangement.)

26. A is the correct answer, because only
choice I is correct. Attorney fees need
only be reasonable, not equal - thus, I
is correct. MR 1.5; DR 2-106; EC 2-17.
II is incorrect for the same reason that I
is correct. III is incorrect because there
is no state action; thus, the Equal Pro 
tection Clause is not relevant.

27. D is the correct answer. Fee splits are
acceptable with attorneys outside the
firm if the client consents and the fee is
not raised. MR l.5(e); DR 2-107(A). A
is incorrect for the same reasons that D
is correct. B is incorrect because it mis 
reads the facts. This fee split was in pro 
portion to actual attorney work per 
formed. (Please note: the Model Code
requires an equal fee split; but the
Model Rules do not. Regardless of this
code difference, this answer is incorrect
because it misreads the facts.) C is in 
correct because Rex did consent.

PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY Em

28. A is the correct answer because only
choice I is correct. I is correct because
Chip really should have asked his cli 
ent prior to investigating the possibil 
ity of bringing another attorney aboard.
MR 1.5(e); DR 2-107(A). II is incor 
rect, because withdrawal is not neces 
sary. III is incorrect because the code
does not suggest that disproportionate
attorney fee splits are always preferable.

29. B is the correct answer. Although the
receipt of client chattels as fee is not
preferable, such is not prohibited. See
MR 1.5, Comment [2]. A, C and Dare
incorrect for the same reason that B is
correct.

30. D is the correct answer. When there is
a fee dispute between the lawyer and
client, the lawyer should recommend
arbitration. Such, however, is not re 
quired. See MR 1.5, Comment [5].
[Note: it would be a different fact-pat 
tern entirely, where the fee is in the trust
account of the attorney. Such is not the
case when the fee is paid up front, as
here.] A is incorrect for the same rea 
son that D is correct. B is incorrect be 
cause attorneys need not return fees
which they reasonably believe they
have earned. C is incorrect because at 
torneys must not threaten or harm cli 
ents so as to keep their fees which are
in dispute.

31. D is the correct answer. Somewhat sur 
prisingly, there is no requirement that
an attorney reveal an intended future
crime of her client. The option is given
if the crime involves physical danger
or corporate fraud under MR 1.6. There 
fore, D is correct. A is incorrect for the
same reason that D is correct. B is in 
correct because an attorney need only
withdraw when the crime (or fraud) is
on the court itself. C is incorrect because
it misreads the facts - the crime was
reasonably apparent.

32. B is the correct answer because only
choices I and IV are correct. I is correct
because an attorney is permitted to keep
to herself her client's spoken intent to
commit a future dangerous crime. MR
1.6(b)(l); DR 4-101(C)(3.) IV is cor 
rect because an attorney is permitted to
reveal a confidence if such is reason 
ably related to and reasonably neces 
sary to defense of herself. MR 1.6(b)(2);
DR 4-101(C)(4.) II is incorrect for the
same reasons that I and IV are correct.
III is incorrect because it gives the
wrong reason for the permission to re 
veal data necessary to defend oneself.
It does not matter whether the revela 
tion involves a confidence (testimonial 
type information received from the cli 
ent) or a secret (non-testimonial obser 
vations made by the attorney of the cli 
ent). In either case, the attorney may
reveal such to defend herself or protect
another party from violence. But, out 
side of these exceptions, neither confi 
dences nor secrets are permitted to be
revealed.

EmiJ PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTY

33. C is the correct answer. Although an
attorney is permitted to represent mul 
tiple clients in one cause of action, if a
conflict develops between any of the
clients, the attorney must withdraw
from all. MR 1.7(b); DR 5-105(C.) A,
Band D are incorrect for the same rea 
son that C is correct.

34. C is the correct answer. Since the par 
ties, the court, and the time-frame are
all different there is no real conflict of
interest in taking an opposite legal po 
sition some time in the future. See MR
1.7, Comment [9]. A and B are incor 
rect for the same reasons that C is cor 
rect. D is incorrect because it is irrel 
evant whether or not the case was
de-published. The issue is whether the
attorney misbehaved - not whether the
case has precedential weight.

35. D is correct because only choices II, III,
IV and V are correct. II is correct be 
cause business transactions between
lawyers and their clients are not pro 
hibited completely. MR 1.8(a); DR
5-104(A.) III is correct because, under
MR 1.8(a)(3) written client consent is
required, but there is no such require 
ment in the Model Code of Professional
Responsibility. Therefore, the correct
answer for the MPRE uses discretion 
ary language, such as the word
"should." IV is correct because telling
the client that he need not do business
with the lawyer insures that the client's
participation is voluntary and that there
is no attorney over-reaching. MR
1.8(a)(l); DR 5-104(A); EC 5-3. V is
correct for the same reasons that IV is
correct.

36. D is the correct answer. Under MR
1.8(h), a lawyer is permitted to prospec 
tively limit his malpractice liability only
if the client receives independent legal
advice recommending such. There was
none here. (Under DR 6-102(A), such
a waiver is, per se, banned.) Thus, D is
correct. A is incorrect because attorneys
are permitted to lower prices so as to
compete with their peers. Band C are
incorrect because no facts indicate that
Delta paid the magazine reporter to stir
up business for him.

PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBIUTY Em

40. A is the correct answer. A vicariously
disqualified attorney (here Smith) is no
longer disqualified if he discontinues
association with the actually disquali 
fied attorney. See generally MR 1.10;
DR 5-105(D). Band C are correct an 
swers, but they are less specific and,
thus, less preferable to choice A. D is
incorrect for the same reason that A is
correct.

41. B is the correct answer. Actual or im 
puted disqualification can be waived by
the opposing party. Thus, since such
occurred here, B is the correct answer.
MR 1.lO(d). A is incorrect because in
no way does it appear that Kingsley's
lawyers compromised his case - Gloria
had to be screened off the case. C is in 
correct because whether or not Smith
and Jones take the case, Gloria has per 
formed up to the standards by making
the conflict known and apparently tak 
ing no part in the case. D is incorrect
since no facts whatsoever suggest that
Gloria will compromise Kingsley's po 
sition.

37. D is the correct answer. An attorney is
not permitted to receive as his fee rights
to a book about the subject matter of
the litigation. MR 1.8(d); DR 5-104(B).
Thus, A, Band C are incorrect; and D
is the best answer. (Note: California law
may permit such an arrangement.)

38. A is the correct answer. When a lawyer
has learned something confidential and
relevant about a client, she is not per 
mitted to oppose that client in a later
case. MR 1.9(a); EC 4-6. B is incorrect
because it misreads the facts. The facts
indicate that the prior confidence is
"somewhat related," thus, the best an 
swer is that Gloria cannot take the case.
C is incorrect because screening Gloria
off the case is not an available option
under the facts. D is incorrect for the
same reason that A is correct.

39. C is correct because choices I, II and II
are correct. When a lawyer in a firm is
disqualified, generally all lawyers in the
firm are disqualified. MR 1.10; DR
5-105(D). Although terminating Gloria
is harsh and may open Smith and Jones
to civil liability for wrongful termina 
tion; the termination will remove the
conflict of interest. Screening Gloria off
the case is acceptable, provided there
is written consent.

B PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBlurY

45. C is the correct answer. Angel is in a
difficult position. Not only should he
counsel Jim and Rockford Corp., but
he also may have some duties to Dodd
- who apparently is seeking Angel's
legal advice. Since what Dodd says may
hurt Dodd if revealed - but may possi 
bly aid Rockford Corp., Angel should
as soon as possible tell Dodd that he
represents Rockford not Dodd. Other 
wise, there might arise an impermissible
conflict of interest between the duties
owed to Rockford and those owed to
Dodd. Without this kind of warning,
Dodd's interests might severely be com 
promised. See MR 1.13, Comment [8].
Although withdrawing would be per 
missible, Dodd's interests are more im 
minent and, thus, important, thus, C is
a better answer than A. Similarly, al 
though counseling against future fraud
is important, Dodd should be told by
Angel that Angel is not his attorney  
and, thus, their conversation is not privi 
leged. Therefore, again, C is a better
answer than B. For similar reasons of
imminence and the immediacy of
Dodd's problems, C is a better answer
than D.

42. C is the correct answer. MR 1.11(a)
permits the new firm not to be disquali 
fied if the former government attorney
is screened off the case and the oppos 
ing party is given notice. This rule al 
lows government attorneys mobility
and is probably a necessity due to the
large volume of cases that government
attorneys deal with. A and B are incor 
rect because they avoid discussing the
particulars of the rule which governs
this situation. D is an incorrect answer
because, although it correctly states the
policy behind the rule, it does not state
the rule itself. As always, a more spe 
cific answer is to be chosen over a cor 
rect but more general answer.

43. C is the correct answer. When a lawyer
works for a business entity and a direc 
tor of that entity indicates the desire to
perform an act involving fraud, the first
thing the attorney should do is ask this
individual to reconsider and seek a sec 
ond opinion from another attorney. See
MR 1.13(b); EC 5-18; EC 5-24; DR
5-107(B). Thus, C is correct. Since
withdrawal at this point is not required,
both A and B are incorrect. D is incor 
rect because a breach of the confidence
is not acceptable.

44. A is the correct answer. Going over the
head of the individual in the business
entity who intends to do the fraud is the
correct course of conduct. Thus, A is
correct. MR 1.13(b). B, C and D are in 
correct for the same reason that A is
correct.

PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBIUTY •

46. C is the correct answer. Although this
attorney is in good faith and has made
a legitimate economic decision; never 
theless the code is quite unforgiving. It
is required that the trust account be in
the state in which the attorney practices
law. MR 1.15; DR 9-102(A). A is in 
correct because the conduct is not
fraudulent. B is incorrect for the same
reason that C is correct. Although the
attorney's choice may be economically
intelligent, it is legally stupid to overtly
violate the code. [Please note: the stu 
dent may have noted an inordinate num 
ber of C choices as the correct answer.
This was purposeful, on the part of the
drafter. Students should not be attempt 
ing to "fudge" answers such that there
are 25 % of each choice.]

47. C is the correct answer. Although re 
ceiving property as advance payment
of fees from a client is not preferred, it
is acceptable if such is kept separate
from the property of the attorney. Put 
ting the property in a client-only safety
deposit box is the ideal method. See MR
1.15, Comment [1]; DR 9-102(B)(2). A
is incorrect for the same reason that C
is correct. B is incorrect because a prob 
lem will arise if less money is earned
than the value of the watch. D is cor 
rect, but C is a more specific, thus, bet 
ter answer.

48. B is the correct answer. The Model
Rules recommend the procedure of 
fered in choice B. See MR U5(c) and
Comment [3]. A is incorrect because it
entirely disregards the client's wishes
which may have a reasonable basis. B
is incorrect, since by paying the client,
the attorney may be furthering a fraud.
D is incorrect only because the attor 
ney has no claim to the funds and, thus,
is not a necessary party to the arbitra 
tion.

49. D is the correct answer. A is incorrect
because it is in dispute that $150,000 is
owed to client. Such must be paid. Only
$40,000 is in dispute. Band C are in 
correct because it is not a defense to
taking disputed funds out of the trust
account that the client is acting irratio 
nally.

50. A is the correct answer. That the client
is not injured is irrelevant to the rule
prohibiting commingling. Since taking
Client's funds was without consent, it
is commingling. B is incorrect because
lawyers are permitted to gamble with
their own money, outside of their prac 
tice of law. C and D are incorrect for
the same reasons that A is correct.

IDB PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBlurY

53. D is the correct answer. Attorneys must
not either harass an opposing party or
pursue a frivolous argument. MR 3.1;
DR 7-102(A)(l). Since it is stipulated
that Vardon merely desired to "wear
down" the opposing party, such action
is definitely prohibited, and, thus, only
D is the correct answer. A, Band Care
incorrect for the very same reason that
D is correct.

54. A is the correct answer. Prosecutors
have a higher duty of "justice" than
other attorneys - not only must they
obey the applicable code of legal eth 
ics and do a good job but they also must
personally and reasonably believe that
she who the prosecutor is prosecuting
is more likely than not guilty. Prosecu 
tors do not have the luxury of simply
trying "pretty good" cases. MR 3.1; See
generally 7-102. Thus, A is correct, and
B, C and D are incorrect.

51. B is the correct answer. There was cer 
tainly commingling and this is certainly
prohibited. Since harm to the client is
irrelevant when there is commingling,
A is a poor choice. C is incorrect be 
cause there is no good faith exception
to the rule prohibiting commingling.
However, in passing, it is noted that the
state disciplinary board may consider
the good faith when doling out the pun 
ishment. D is incorrect because illness
on the part of the attorney may be a
mitigating factor. See generally MR
1.15, DR 9-102. [Please note: the call
of this question was phrased in the nega 
tive.]

52. B is the correct answer. Because the
attorney-client relationship is fiduciary
in nature and because it is the client who
is in the position of trust, clients are
generally permitted to terminate the
services of their attorneys "at will" with
little or no penalty. MR 1.16(a)(3); DR
2-110(B)(4). Attorneys, when termi 
nated, as a general rule, must withdraw;
thus, B is the correct answer. A and C
are incorrect for the same reasons that
B is correct. D is incorrect because there
is no need for arbitration as to whether
the attorney must withdraw after being
fired by the client - the lawyer shall
withdraw.

PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBIUTY B

55. B is the correct answer because only
choices I and II are correct. I is correct
because attorneys are generally not dis 
ciplined for simply losing cases. There
must be another factor, such as neglect.
II is correct because attorneys need not
reveal cases on point which are outside
the jurisdiction. However, attorneys
must reveal cases within the jurisdic 
tion which are directly on point; thus,
III is incorrect. MR 3.3(a)(3); DR
7-106(B)(1). (Note: there is no such
requirement to reveal contra cases in
California.) IV is incorrect because at 
torneys must not purposely mislead the
jury in closing argument. MR 3.3(a)(1);
DR 7- 102(A)(5). (Note: the call of this
question is phrased in the negative.)

56. A is the correct answer. An attorney
must not help a client commit perjury.
MR 3.3(a)(4); DR 7-102(A)(4). Since
Shannon did this, she is subject to dis 
cipline. In order for an attorney to be
civilly liable for malpractice, there must
occur two elements: 1) an attorney er 
ror (usually shown by referring to the
state's code of ethics) and 2) harm/dam 
ages to the client. Since Winston was
acquitted, prong 2 is lacking and there
is no malpractice liability. Only choice
A includes the above two propositions
(discipline but no malpractice.) Thus,
B, C and D are incorrect.

57. D is the correct answer because only
choices III, IV and V are correct. An
attorney must counsel his client to fur 
nish to the opposing party all material
evidence. MR 3.4(a); DR 7-109(A.)
Since the document is certainly mate 
rial evidence, O'Mallory must advise
his client to make such available. I and
II are, thus, incorrect and III and IV are,
thus, correct. V is correct because in the
event that the client refuses to tum over
material evidence the attorney cannot
blow the whistle. Moreover, attorneys
are permitted to tell clients the
attorney's ethical duties.

58. A is the correct answer. Attorneys en 
joy a real degree of First Amendment
free speech protection; thus, they are
permitted to speak to the press pre-trial.
Attorneys can be disciplined only if
they intend or should have known that
their comments will prejudice the trial.
Since Flash's conduct fell short ofthat,
it was proper. B, C and D are incorrect
for the same reasons that A is correct.
See generally MR 3.6(a); DR 7-107.

59. A is the correct answer. A lawyer is per 
mitted to testify as to the value of her
legal services, thus, A is the correct an 
swer. MR 3.7(a)(2); DR 5-lOl(B)(3).
B, C and D are incorrect for the same
reason that A is correct.

mJ PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTY

60. D is the correct answer. A lawyer must
not communicate with a represented
party absent the opposing lawyer's con 
sent or judicial order. MR 4.2. There
was no order here. Thus A, Band Care
incorrect.

61. A is the correct answer. It is no defense
to a charge of discipline that the charged
lawyer was simply obeying the orders
of his superior. MR 5.2(a). It is a disci 
plinary violation to intentionally mis 
lead the opposing party. MR 4.1; DR
7-102. Thus, A is correct and B is in 
correct. C and D are incorrect because
more facts are needed as to whether
there is tort liability, e.g., were there
damages?

62. C is the correct answer because both
choices I and II are correct. A lawyer is
responsible when he directs another
lawyer to violate the rules of ethics.
Thus, I is correct. Similarly, a lawyer
must supervise underling employees.
Thus, II is correct. See generally MR
5.1.

63. A is the correct answer. Until a lawyer
has been sworn in, he is not licensed to
practice law. Since Bob was not sworn
in, did not receive a waiver from he
court, was not practicing with a licensed
attorney of record and was within no
other exception - he was practicing law
without a license. B is incorrect because
he did not have a law license - he was
waiting. C is incorrect because profit 
motive is not the test for the unautho 
rized practice of law. D is incorrect be 
cause a lawyer need not be in court to
be practicing without a license. MR 5.5;
DR 3-101(B).

64. D is the correct answer. A lawyer must
not restrict the rights of other lawyers
to practice law, when they are no longer
in the same firm. MR 5.6(a); DR 2-108.
A is incorrect because such arrange 
ments are per se unreasonable. B is in 
correct because the facts are explicit  
there was such a requirement. C is in 
correct because both codes are in com 
plete agreement.

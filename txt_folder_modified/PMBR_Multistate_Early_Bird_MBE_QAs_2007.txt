Question 1 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 2 is based on the following fact situation.

Peters was a sports enthusiast who enjoyed playing
rugby on the weekends with a group of friends
from college. The rugby matches were usually quite
competitive and invariably someone would experi-
ence a minor injury because of the large degree of
physical contact usually associated with the sport.
During one Saturday afternoon rugby match, Peters
was running to catch the ball when he was pushed
down from behind by Dooley. Peters suffered a bro-
ken arm and brought suit against Dooley seeking
damages.

2.	 Will Peters prevail?

(A) Yes, because Peters suffered a harmful

and offensive touching.

(B) Yes, if Dooley intended to push Peters.
(C) No, because Peters assumed the risk of

physical injury.

(D) No, unless Dooley intentionally pushed
Peters with a degree of force beyond the
scope of the rugby players' consent to
physical contact.

Keiki, a graduate of University of Hawaii Law
School, received notice that she had successfully
passed the Hawaii bar exam. To celebrate passing,
Keiki went out with a few friends to the Aloha Hut,
a popular campus bar. While sitting at the bar,
Malihini, Keiki's friend, ordered a round of "Hula
Girls" for everyone. A "Hula Girl" is an extremely
potent alcoholic drink consisting of 2 oz. of dry
gin, 1 oz. French vermouth with 1 tsp. grenadine.
After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass
with an inverted lemon peel which is cut at the ends
to represent a grass skirt.

Although Keiki had never heard of a "Hula Girl"
before, she was in a festive mood and drank it any-
way. A few minutes later, Keiki became very dizzy
and attempted to stand up from the bar stool. As
she tried to walk to the restroom, she got nauseous
and then vomited over Haole, a customer, sitting at
a nearby table. Haole was embarrassed and greatly
humiliated by the incident.

1.	

If Haole asserts a claim against Keiki, the
plaintiff will most likely

(A) prevail, because Keiki's conduct was

extreme and outrageous

(B) prevail, because an offensive touching

resulted

(C) not prevail, because Keiki's actions were

involuntary

(D) not prevail, because Haole was embar-
rassed and humiliated but suffered no
other injury

Question 3 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 4 is based on the following fact situation.

Bambi and her boyfriend, Barkley, were third-year
students at Cumberland Law School. Bambi and
Barkley lived together in an apartment at the
Clemson Towers in the Longwood section of
Birmingham. One evening Bambi and Barkley got
into a heated argument after Bambi confessed to
having an affair with Professor Toote, her
Admiralty instructor. After Barkley slapped Bambi,
she left the apartment vowing never to return. As
Bambi was hastily walking down the hallway
toward the front door, Barkley chased Bambi and
begged her to stay. When Bambi refused, Barkley
grabbed her arm and tried to apologize. Bambi then
told Barkley the relationship was over and to please
let go of her arm. As Barkley continued to try to
prevent Bambi from leaving, she kneed him in the
groin.

The noise from this struggle attracted the attention
of Mrs. Mertz, who lived in the Clemson Towers.
Mrs. Mertz opened her apartment door and stood in
the hallway watching Bambi and Barkley grappling
with one another. Mrs. Mertz then started shouting
encouragement to Bambi. As the struggle ensued,
Bambi swung her pocketbook at Barkley. When he
ducked to avoid being hit, Barkley fell backwards
into Mrs. Mertz and accidentally struck her chin
with his elbow. The force of the blow fractured
Mrs. Mertz's jaw.

3.	

If Mrs. Mertz asserts a tort action against
Barkley, she will most likely

(A) prevail, because an offensive touching

(B) prevail, if Barkley was negligent
(C) not prevail, because Barkley struck her

(D) not prevail, if Barkley acted in self-

Bates owned Winterthur, a 200 acre tract of
farmland, located in the northeast sector of New
Hampshire. There was a private roadway which
extended along a section of Winterthur and led
into a public highway. Frequently, motorists would
utilize this private roadway as a shortcut to gain
access to the highway. Although Bates posted
"No Trespassing" signs along his property, he was
unable to prevent motorists from traversing across
his farm.

During a winter snowstorm, sections of the public
highway were closed as snow removal units tried to
clear the road. As a result, many motorists used
Bates private roadway as an alternate access route.
As Bates himself was operating a tractor and
removing snow along his roadway, a car driven by
Asher approached from behind. Realizing that he
was unable to pass Bates, Asher honked his horn
and motioned for Bates to let him through.

Becoming agitated, Bates hollered at Asher and told
him to turn around and get off his property. When
Asher refused to turn around, Bates hopped off the
tractor and approached Asher's vehicle. Afraid that
Bates was about to attack him, Asher put his car in
reverse and attempted to drive off Bates then
picked up a rock and threw it at Asher. The rock
struck the windshield of the car. Frightened, Asher
momentarily lost control of the vehicle. He then
proceeded to drive off

4.	

If Asher asserts a claim against Bates, Asher
will most likely

(A)
recover for trespass to chattels
(B)
recover for assault and battery
(C) not recover, because Bates was privi-

leged to use reasonable force to prevent
Asher's entry onto the property
(D) not recover, unless Bates intended to
cause an offensive or harmful contact

Question 5 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 6 is based on the following fact situation.

Pauline is an 18-year-old high school student who
was experiencing emotional problems resulting
from her parents' recent divorce. Don, a teacher at
Pauline's school found out about Pauline's problems
at home and tried to get Pauline to discuss her feel-
ings. Don and Pauline would meet after school and
talk several times each week. After several months
of long conversations, Don and Pauline engaged in
a sexual relationship. After Pauline's mother discov-
ered the relationship and confronted her daughter,
Pauline needed to seek counseling from a psy-
chotherapist to deal with the emotional turmoil.
Pauline's mother brought suit against Don on
Pauline's behalf.

5.	

The most likely grounds for recovery is to
bring a suit on a theory of

(A) negligent infliction of emotional distress
(B)

intentional infliction of emotional dis-
tress
battery
invasion of privacy

(C)
(D)

The city of Metropolis has an ordinance that makes
it an offense, punishable by fine, for the owner of a
dog to permit the dog to run unleashed on a public
way.

Smythe, a police officer, observed a small dog
running loose in the street. As he picked the dog
up, Nelson, who was seated in her car lawfully
parked at the curb, called out, "Oh, thank you,
Officer, for returning Fido." Smythe asked Nelson
whether the dog was hers, and when she acknowl-
edged ownership, he asked her to see her driver's
license. Nelson gave her name and address, but she
refused to produce a driver's license. Smythe then
told her to produce her driver's license if she did
not want to go to jail. Nelson responded by saying,
"Isn't this ridiculous?" Smythe took her by the arm
and said, "Let's go. You are under arrest."

Nelson cried out that Smythe was hurting her but
he refused to release her arm, and she struck him
with her free hand. Smythe then dragged Nelson
from her car, forced her into his squad car, and
took her to the police station.

The incident took place on the street in front of
the apartment where Nelson and her aged father,
Joplin, lived. Smythe did not know that Joplin
had observed what took place from a window in
the apartment.

6.	

If Nelson's father, Joplin, asserts a claim
against Smythe for intentional infliction of
emotional distress, will Joplin prevail?

(A) Yes, if Smythe's acts caused Joplin

severe emotional distress.

(B) Yes, if it is found that Smythe's behavior
was extreme and outrageous with
respect to Nelson.

(C) No, because Smythe did not know that

Joplin was watching.

(D) No, because Joplin was not within the

zone of physical danger.

Question 8 is based on the following fact situation.

Priscilla Patterson went to Dr. Goodright for treat-
ment of a painful ear discomfort which had caused
her to experience loss of balance, dizziness and
nausea. While Dr. Goodright was examining her
inner ear, he noticed a lump of wax. As Dr.
Goodright was removing the lump with his hemo-
stat (elongated medical instrument), he also noticed
what appeared to be the rear legs of an insect. With
utmost care, Dr. Goodright extracted the foreign
object from Priscilla's ear.

Dr. Goodright then examined the substance, which
proved to be a German cockroach. As he held the
insect in front of Priscilla to see, she became hys-
terical, fainted, and fell to the floor breaking her
collarbone. The incident caused Priscilla to develop
a phobia and she became deathly afraid of insects.

Jensen lived along the coast in Gulf Shores,
Alabama. There was a national weather advisory
warning all residents that Hurricane Hazel was
approaching the Gulf Shore area. The national
weather bureau warned all Gulf Shore residents
to evacuate their homes and flee inland for
their safety.

Jensen, who heard the announcment, ignored the
warning and stayed at home. The hurricane caused
torrential flooding and destroyed Jensen's home.
To save his life, Jensen took his neighbor's boat
without permission and navigated it across the gulf.
The boat, which was owned by Baxter, was worth
$25,000. While Jensen was operating the boat,
the mast from the keel broke off, causing $8,000
in damages.

7.	

In a suit for damages against Dr. Goodright,
which of the following torts would provide
Priscilla with her best theory of recovery?

8.	

Baxter has asserted a tort action against
Jensen. The plaintiff should be entitled to
recover

(A) battery
(B) negligence
(C) negligent infliction of emotional distress
(D)

intentional infliction of emotional dis-
tress

(A) nothing, because Jensen took the boat in

an emergency situation

(B) nothing, unless Jensen was negligent in
causing the boat to be damaged

Question 10 is based on the following fact situation.

Vic Vicory was an attorney who had an office in
Greensboro. After winning a big antitrust case, Vic
and a few associates decided to celebrate and have
a few drinks at The Rainbow Room, a popular
downtown watering hole. After having two gimlets
(a cocktail containing vodka and Rose's lime juice),
Vic left his friends and drove home.

Vic, who was a bit tipsy, began driving in an erratic
and reckless manner. He was traveling at an exces-
sive speed along a residential section of town when
he approached a sharp curve in the roadway. Trying
to negotiate the turn, Vic lost control of his vehicle
and it veered off the road and landed on the front
lawn of Edna Edsell's property.

10. If Edna asserts a claim against Vic for enter-

ing her land, she will most likely

(A) prevail, because Vic was operating his

car recklessly

(B) prevail, because Vic entered onto her

property

(C) not prevail, unless Vic damaged her land
(D) not prevail, because he did not intention-

ally enter onto her property

One evening Feinstein was having dinner at
Madame Wu's Chinese Restaurant in Georgetown.
After finishing her meal, she went to the coatroom
to retrieve her overcoat. Inadvertently, Feinstein
took Haller's overcoat which was the same color
and design as her own coat. Honestly believing that
she had her coat, Feinstein left the restaurant with-
out noticing the difference.

When Feinstein arrived home about one hour later,
she discovered the mistake. Since it was nearly
midnight, Feinstein decided to wait and return the
coat the next day. The following morning, Feinstein
was driving back to Madame Wu's with the over-
coat when she was involved in a near fatal automo-
bile accident. A bus driver lost control of his
vehicle and crashed head-on into Feinstein's car.
Feinstein, who suffered multiple injuries, was
trapped in the mangled wreckage and had to be
pried from the car. The overcoat, which Feinstein
was returning, was ripped to shreds and destroyed.

9.	

If Haller asserts a claim against Feinstein to
recover the value of the coat, will Haller pre-
vail?

Yes, because Feinstein intended to take
the coat and it was destroyed while in
her possession.
Yes, because by not returning the coat
when she discovered the mistake, Fein-
stein committed a continuing trespass to
chattel property.
No, because since Feinstein honestly
believed the coat to be her own, she
lacked the requisite mens rea when she
took it.
No, because Feinstein tried to return the
coat within a reasonable time after dis-
covering her mistake.

Question 12 is based on the following fact situation.

One morning Drake Dobberman and his friend,
Fenwick Friehofer, were playing golf at the
Greenhill Country Club. Drake and Fenwick
were 16-year-old boys who attended Seton Hall
Preparatory School. They were members of the
golf team and were evenly matched players. After
completing the first nine holes, Drake was leading
Fenwick by three strokes, 40 to 43. The boys
approached the 10th hole which was a par four and
467 yards long. Drake shot first and hit a towering
tee shot down the left side of the fairway about 240
yards. Fenwick then hit his tee shot which traveled
down the middle of the fairway. The ball, however,
struck a tree limb that extended over the fairway
and deflected onto Virginia Slim's property which
was adjacent to the golf course. Virginia, who was
sitting outside on a lounge chair, was struck on the
head by Fenwick's golf ball. Virginia suffered a
bump on her head but was not otherwise seriously
injured.

Dwyer is a fifty-two-year-old woman who is a
diabetic. As part of her daily medical routine, she
drinks a pint of orange juice. Early one evening
Dwyer realized she had not had her dosage of
orange juice. She then went to Wawa Convenience
Store to buy a carton of orange juice. As she was
in line waiting to pay, Dwyer started to feel light-
headed. Since the line of customers was quite long,
she went to the checkout counter and put two
dollars down. The list price for the orange juice
was $1.79. She proceeded to leave the store.

Hardcastle, Wawa's security guard, saw Dwyer
walk out the store with the orange juice carton in
her hand. Believing that she had stolen the juice,
he followed her out the store. When he saw her
get into her car, Hardcastle immediately jumped
into the company van. He then drove the van
behind Dwyer's car preventing her from leaving.
Hardcastle then approached Dwyer's car intending
to question her regarding the suspected theft.
Unable to exit the store parking lot, Dwyer being

Lloyd and Benson were old friends who enjoyed
hunting together. One weekend Lloyd and Benson
went on a quail hunting expedition in a remote
wilderness area deep in the Wasatch Mountains of
northeastern Utah. They were hunting in a very des-
olate area surrounded by mountainous terrain which
was located at least fifty miles from any habitation.
With hunting rifles in hand, they were ambling
around but no game was visible. After a rather
uneventful morning with nothing to shoot at, Lloyd
suddenly spotted a Utah condor, a large nearly
extinct vulture. The condor was of an endangered
species and to shoot one in Utah was a criminal
offense.

Unable to resist the temptation, Lloyd took a shot at
the condor. The bullet missed the vulture but struck
Bush, a state forest ranger, who was hiding in a
secluded area, watching a trail frequented by drug
smugglers. The bullet hit Bush in the eye and per-
manently blinded him. Neither Lloyd nor Benson
were aware of Bush's presence.

13. If Bush asserts a claim against Lloyd to

recover damages for his injury, Bush will

(A) prevail, if Lloyd negligently shot the gun
(B) prevail, because Lloyd intended to shoot

the condor

(C) not prevail, because Lloyd had no reason
to anticipate the presence of another per-
son in such a remote area

Tim shot and seriously injured the proprietor,
Chase Carey.

15. Chase thereafter brings a civil action against
Shirley and Morningstar High School to

Boalt Hall in Berkeley, California. One weekend
Amy had made plans to drive to Los Angeles to

Los Angeles area, asked Amy if she could accom-

ing on the trip, Carl, Amy's neighbor, asked her if
she would deliver a small package to his brother in
Los Angeles. She assented and placed the package
in the glove compartment of the car. Unknown to
Amy, the package contained hyrozoic acid, a caustic
chemical, which Carl's brother was planning to use
in a chemistry experiment.

During their drive to Los Angeles, Beth reached
into the glove compartment to get a roadmap. As
she did so, Beth inadvertently grabbed Carl's pack-
age which had been leaking acid. The acid seriously
burned her hand.

16. If Beth asserts a claim against Amy, the prob-

able result is that Beth will

(A)

recover, because Amy will be strictly
liable
recover, because Amy was under a duty
to ascertain the contents of the package
(C) not recover, because Amy was unaware

(B)

Question 18 is based on the following fact situation.

McGuinn was a guest of the exclusive Nob Hill
Hotel in San Francisco where he was residing on a
long-term basis. The hotel's outer structure had
been built as a replica of the classic Roman style of
architecture with Ionic columns and marble fres-
coes draped over the entrance. The elaborate entry-
way led inside to a variety of shops and restaurants
which adjoined the hotel lobby.

The Nob Hill management knew that pigeons often
nested inside the overhead sculptures. This resulted
in pigeon droppings frequently falling outside the
main entryway. Consequently, the hotel manage-
ment instructed its employees to clean the area
around the front entrance on a daily basis.

One afternoon McGuinn's friend, Crosby, came by
the Nob Hill Hotel to pay a visit. As Crosby walked
under the columns to enter the hotel, he slipped on
some pigeon droppings which had not been wiped
up. On this particular day the hotel employees had
failed to clean the entrance area. Injuring his leg,
Crosby now brings suit against the Nob Hill.

Thad and Terri Tabor lived in a quiet residential
neighborhood located on the outskirts of San
Antonio. The Tabors built a tree house in the back
yard for their three adolescent children. During the
Labor Day weekend, the Tabor family drove on a
vacation trip to Galveston. While the family was
away, Buster, a 10-year-old youngster who lived in
the neighborhood, trespassed upon the property.
Buster was in the Tabor's backyard when he saw the
tree house which was situated in a tall oak tree.
Buster climbed up the ladder and began playing in
the tree house.

While inside, Buster peered out the window and
saw a large limb with avocados perched above the
tree house. Buster decided to collect a few avoca-
dos to bring home to his mother. When Buster was
unable to reach the avocados, he then climbed on
top of the roof of the tree house in an effort to get
closer to the avocado branch. As Buster was walk-
ing along the roof, he slipped and fell to the
ground. This fall caused Buster to severely fracture
his ankle and leg.

17. In his personal injury action, Crosby will

18. If Buster's parents assert a tort action against
the Tabors to recover for Buster's injuries, the
plaintiffs will likely

failed to remedy it in a timely manner
recover, because the hotel employees
had not cleaned the entryway
not recover, because Crosby was not a

Question 19 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 20 is based on the following fact situation.

A Pennsylvania state statute prohibits the sale of
liquor on Sundays before noontime. Harry Hillcrest
was employed as a clerk at Luciano's Liquor Store
in Center City Philadelphia. At 11:25am on Sunday
morning Harry sold a six pack of Rolling Rock
beer to Bobby Wine, a customer. Harry incorrectly
believed the time to be 12:25pm. In fact, the time
on the clock inside the store was 12:25pm. The pre-
vious night, however, daylight savings time ended
and the clock in the store had not been turned back
when Harry came to work.

Upon leaving the store, Bobby drank all six bottles
of beer and became very intoxicated. While driving
carelessly, Bobby drove through a red light and
struck Regina Regent, a pedestrian, as she was
crossing the street. Regina was seriously injured in
the accident.

19. If Regina asserts a tort action against

Luciano's Liquor Store to recover damages for
her injuries, she will

(A) prevail, because the clerk sold the beer

at 11:25am in violation of the statute

(B) prevail, because the store is vicariously
liable for the tortious conduct of its
employee

(C) not prevail, unless the clerk knew or had

reason to know that Wine would exces-
sively drink the beer and drive in an
intoxicated condition

(D) not prevail, if the store was non-negli-

gent in failing to change the time on the

Esteban parked his BMW convertible on a steep
hill on California Avenue in San Francisco. He then
walked a few blocks to the China Grill to meet a
few friends for lunch. While Esteban was at the
restaurant, his car rolled down the hill and struck
Tiffany as she was walking across the street.
Tiffany suffered a fractured leg in the accident.

Tiffany sued Esteban to recover damages for her
injury. At trial, Tiffany merely introduced evidence
that Esteban parked his car on California Avenue
and the vehicle rolled down the street striking her.
However, Tiffany did not present any evidence
showing negligence on the part of Esteban.

20. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's case-in-

chief, both parties move for a directed verdict.
The court should

grant plaintiff's motion, because it is
more probable than not that defendant
was negligent in allowing his car to roll
down the street
grant the defendant's motion, because
plaintiff did not present any evidence
showing negligence on the part of the
defendant
deny both motions, because under the
circumstances the jury may infer negli-
gence on the part of the defendant
deny the plaintiff's motion, but allow the
defendant to present rebuttal evidence
before ruling on the defendant's motion

Hieroglyphics, a popular paperback bookstore, had
just opened for business in a new and larger facility.
Simon Contracting Company had remodeled the
space to suit their specifications including replas-
tering the walls and ceiling.

One morning shortly after the grand opening,
Melba, the manager, noticed pieces of plaster on
the floor near some shelves where some best sellers
were "On Sale." Melba swept up the plaster on the
floor and called Simon Contracting, demanding that
they immediately make necessary repairs.

Two hours later, Sandy entered the bookstore look-
ing for a recently-released murder mystery. As he
approached the shelves containing the best sellers
on sale and reached for a book, a large piece of
plaster fell on Sandy's head. Sandy had to be hospi-
talized with a concussion.

21. If Sandy sues Hieroglyphics, he will

(A)

(B)

recover, only if Hieroglyphics acted
unreasonably in leaving popular sale
items in an area of danger
recover, because Sandy is a business

The taxi was being driven by Dawkins who was
the owner-operator of the vehicle. As Dawkins
approached the intersection, she failed to heed
a stop sign, and entered Spectrum Street in the
path of Cunningham's car. Dawkins was injured
in the accident.

While not conceding liability on Cunningham's
part, Cunningham's insurance company paid
Dawkin's medical and hospital bills in the amount
of $20,000. Thereafter, Dawkins brought an action
against Cunningham to recover damages for her
injuries sustained in the accident.

The jury returned a special verdict and held that (1)
Cunningham was guilty of 70 percent and Dawkins
was guilty of 30 percent of the total negligence in
the case; and (2) Dawkins suffered damages in the
amount of $100,000, taking no account of the pay-
ment made by Cunningham's insurance company.
After the verdict was rendered, the court was
advised of the $20,000 paid by Cunningham's
insurance company.

24. Based upon the given facts, the court should
now enter a judgment for Dawkins in the
amount of

(A) $40,000, the proportion of Dawkins'

(B)

damages caused by Cunningham's negli-
gence, less the proportion caused by
Dawkin's negligence
$50,000, the proportion of Dawkins'
damages caused by Cunningham's negli-
gence, less the medical and hospital pay-
ments made by Cunnningham's
insurance company

(C) $70,000, the proportion of Dawkins'

damages caused by Cunningham's negli-
gence, with the medical and hospital
payments being disregarded as coming
from a collateral source

(D) $100„000, because Cunningham's negli-
gence was greater than that of Dawkins

Question 23 is based on the following fact situation.

While on vacation in Hawaii, John and Andy went
scuba diving in the ocean off the island coast of
Maui. Each of them was equipped with a spear gun
which they planned to use to kill sharks. As they
were swimming, both men saw what appeared to
be a large fin entangled in a nearby coral reef.
Simultaneously, they shot their spear guns at the
projecting wing-like figure. Unknown to either
John or Andy, it was not a fish but another scuba
diver whom they shot at. The victim, Randy, was
struck and slightly wounded by one of the spears.

23. Randy asserts a claim for damages against

John and Andy. At trial, the judge should
instruct the jury to rule

(A)

(B)

in favor of both defendants if no evi-
dence is presented showing who actually
shot the spear that injured Randy
against both defendants jointly unless
one of them proves that he did not shoot
the spear that struck Randy
against each defendant for one-half of
the amount of damages because they
both acted independently and not jointly
against each defendant for one-half of
the amount of damages because they
both shot their spear guns simultane-

Question 24 is based on the following fact situation.

Cunningham was driving his car along Spectrum
Street in South Philadelphia at 40 mph (the speed
limit being 25 mph). As he approached an intersec-
tion with Palestra Place, a taxi entered from the
Palestra thoroughfare (which was to the right side
of Cunningham's vehicle). The two cars collided.

When Cunningham saw the taxi he was still far
enough from the intersection that, considering
speed and distance, he might have braked in time.
But he failed to brake promptly. Furthermore,
Cunningham's brakes were not operating properly.
Despite the fact that Cunningham was aware that
his brakes were malfunctioning, he failed to have
the brakes repaired.

Question 26 is based on the following fact situation.

Felix Feller was a Cleveland Indians baseball fan
who purchased two tickets for the Indians World
Series game against the Atlanta Braves. Felix con-
tacted his best friend, Wally Wertz, and invited him
to go to the game. Wally, who was a fanatic Indians
fan, eagerly agreed. Felix told Wally that the game
started at 7:00 p.m. and that he would pick him up
at about 5:00 p.m. so they could get there early to
watch batting practice.

They were driving to the game together when Felix
sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic
signal was changing from amber to red. As he
reached the intersection Felix was traveling at 50
mph although the posted speed limit was 25 mph.
Simultaneously, a car driven by Pat Pafko entered
the intersection on red and collided with Felix's
vehicle. Wally suffered a broken pelvis in the colli-
sion. This jurisdiction has adopted the following
"modified" comparative negligence statute:

"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recov-
ery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to
nor greater than that of the defendant, otherwise no
recovery is permitted."

25. Suppose Wertz brings suit against Pafko to
recover damages for his injury. A jury
returned a special verdict with the following
findings: (1) Felix was 55% negligent in
speeding; (2) Pafko was 45% negligent in
driving through the red light; and (3) Wertz
suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result,
the court should enter a judgment for Wertz
in the amount of

(A) $100,000
$55,000
(B)
(C)
$45,000
(D) Nothing, because Felix was more negli-

In the city of Tampa, Maple Street is a local public
thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for
northbound traffic. Spruce Street is a public thor-
oughfare, designated as a one-way street for east-
bound traffic. Maple and Spruce Streets intersect at
right angles. Visitor, on his first trip to Tampa, got
lost and was driving the wrong way on Maple
Street. Not realizing that Maple Street was a one-
way for northbound traffic, Visitor was traveling in
an southerly direction.

During the same time period, Resident, who was
late for a doctor's appointment, was driving his car
along Spruce Street at an excessive rate of speed.
She was traveling 50 mph which was 20 mph over
the posted speed limit. Both Resident and Visitor
entered the intersection at the same time and col-
lided. The impact caused Resident's car to carom
off the road and crash into a home owned by
Householder. The damage to Householder's home
totaled $25,000. Thereafter, Householder and
Resident reached an agreement whereby Resident
paid Householder $12,500 in damages. According
to their settlement, Householder gave up any claim
she had against Resident, but she could still sue
Visitor for his share of the damages.

26. If Householder now brings suit against Visitor

to recover damages to her home, what is the
maximum recovery, if any, allowable?

(B)

(A) $25,000, since each concurrent tortfea-
sor is jointly and severally liable for the
total amount of damages.
$25,000, since there is no right of con-
tribution among concurrent tortfeasors.
(C) $12,500, since Householder has previ-
ously satisfied part of her claim from
the other concurrent tortfeasor.

(D) Nothing, because Visitor's auto did not

damage Householder's home.

Candace Candy was a single parent who had a
young daughter named Chloe. Chloe, aged 11, took
ballet lessons at the Westside Ballet Academy. One
Saturday Chloe was trying out for a part in the
Nutcracker Christmas show that Westside annually
performed. Candace drove Chloe to the ballet stu-
dio and parked her car in the Safeway Supermarket
parking lot that adjoined the Westside facility.

Since Westside did not have its own parking lot,
parents often parked at Safeway and walked about
100 feet to the Westside dance studio. Safeway
allowed Westside parents access to the parking lot
with the expectation that they would shop at
supermarket.

When Candace and Chloe hopped out of their car
in the Safeway parking lot, they were immediately
accosted by a thief. He grabbed Candace's pocket-
book and then pushed her to the pavement.

27. If Candace asserts a tort action against

Safeway, she will most likely

(A) prevail, because Candace was an invitee
(B) prevail, if Safeway knew of the likeli-

hood of such danger

(C) not prevail, because Safeway is not

Farmer hired Butch, a high school boy, to help him
bale hay on his farm. Farmer owned 20 acres just
inside the city limits of Springfield. As they were
baling hay one day, Farmer was driving the tractor
while Butch stood behind in the hay cart and col-
lected the bales. Late in the afternoon the skies sud-
denly darkened as a storm approached. Because
lightning was common in the area, Farmer knew
that it was safer to be on lower ground during an
electrical storm.

As the storm drew closer, Farmer continued at a
quickened pace to finish his work. Once the rain
and lightning started to erupt, Farmer stopped his
tractor on the top of a hill. A short while later,
Butch, who was sitting behind the tractor in the hay
wagon, was struck and killed by a bolt of lightning.

28. If Butch's parents, on their son's behalf, assert

a wrongful death action against Farmer, the
defendant will most likely be found

(A)

(B)

liable, because Butch was under his
employ when the accident occurred
liable, because he had reason to know of
the danger involved in stopping the trac-

Cal Worthington was the owner of Worthington
Motors, a Honda dealership, located in Long
Beach. To celebrate the 10th Anniversary of his
business, Cal arranged to have a big party at the
dealership facility. He sent out hundreds of invita-
tions and advertised the event in all the local news-
papers. Prior to the party, Roman Candelaria, a
local Long Beach resident, contacted Cal and
offered to put on a free fireworks display at the
party at no cost to Cal. Roman, who had recently
started a new fireworks display business, believed
that the publicity would help promote his services.
Cal agreed to Roman's proposal because he knew
that fireworks were a popular attraction and might
allure more people to the gala.

The party, which was scheduled at 9:00 pm on
Friday night, went off without a hitch. The party
attracted over 200 guests who were entertained by a
roving mariachi band and served cocktails and hot
hors d'oeuvres. During the anniversary celebration,
Roman then set off the fireworks display. One of
the fireworks misfired and struck Griggs, a guest,
who suffered third-degree burns.

30. If Griggs asserts a claim against Cal to

recover damages for his injury, Griggs will
most likely

(A) prevail, because Roman was engaged in

an ultrahazardous activity
(B) prevail, if Roman was negligent

Sally Sales went to Fantasyland, an amusement
park, with her ten year-old son, Soupy. Sally took
Soupy on Montezuma's Revenge, a high speed ride
with a reputation of causing intestinal disorders and
uncontrollable bowel movements. When the ride
started, it began to malfunction due to inadequate
maintenance. As a result, a metal rod broke off and
struck Sally in the face.

As a result of the injury, Sally temporarily lost
vision in her right eye and was required to wear an
eyepatch for one month. Two weeks after the acci-
dent at Fantasyland, Sally was shopping at Home
Depot. She was walking in the lumber section of
the store where a store employee was operating a
forklift. He was driving the forklift negligently and
struck Sally with the machine. Sally did not see the
forklift because her peripheral vision was impaired
by the eyepatch. If Sally had not been wearing the
eyepatch, she would have easily seen the forklift
and avoided the accident. As a result of the forklift
accident, Sally suffered a broken arm.

29. If Sally asserts tort actions against Fantasy-

land and Home Depot to recover damages for
her injuries, she will most likely

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

recover against Fantasyland only for the
temporary loss of vision, and against

Question 32 is based on the following fact situation.

Pierre, an independent research chemist, was trans-
porting in his car a load of foam rubber from his
home to his laboratory. A freezing rain was falling
and a thin film of ice covered the roads. On his
way, Pierre stopped by the Dow Company to pick
up a quantity of highly flammable petroleum deriv-
atives that he also needed in his work. These were
sold in ordinary glass gallon jugs. Shortly after
putting several jugs in the trunk of his car, Pierre
swerved to avoid hitting a station wagon that was
crossing an intersection at a right angle to him.
The driver of the station wagon, Mrs. Hartman,
had applied the brakes in time to stop under ordi-
nary circumstances, but her wheels had struck an
icy patch and she had skidded into the intersection.
As a result of the swerve, Pierre's car rode up on
the sidewalk and overturned, pinning Andy, a
pedestrian, under the car and causing him multiple
injuries. The jugs in the trunk were broken by the
impact, and the chemicals spilled out and caught
fire. Both Pierre and Andy were severely burned.
Andy died a few hours after being taken to the
hospital.

31. In a claim for wrongful death by Andy's

administrator against Pierre, the most likely
result is that the plaintiff will

(A)

(B)

recover, because Pierre's negligence was
the legal cause of Andy's death
recover, because Pierre would be strictly
liable

(C) not recover, because Mrs. Hartman's

conduct constituted a supervening cause
(D) not recover, because there is no evidence
that Pierre failed to exercise due care

Davis Construction Company is a private corpora-
tion that has conducted large-scale blasting and
excavation projects in the northwestern region of
the United States for many years. Several months
ago, Cody Billings, Davis' chief financial officer,
entered into a contract with the Snake River Land
Management Council to clear 5,000 acres in a
rocky wilderness area called Antelope Flats, near
the base of the Grand Teton mountain range. The
area was to be used as a ski resort.

Davis began the project by moving in its heavy
equipment, cutting down a large section of lodge-
pole pine trees, and, where necessary, blasting the
mountainous terrain to create a level area for the
main ski lodge. Davis exercised reasonable care in
the detonation of all explosives used to conduct the
blasting operations. Since the rural area chosen for
the ski resort was sparsely populated, Davis had no
reason to anticipate any risks to persons outside the
5,000 acre tract.

Powell, a rancher, lived in the nearby town of Jenny
Lake and operated a mink farm that was situated on
the northwest boundary of the proposed ski resort.
The noise and vibrations from Davis' blasting
frightened Powell's mink. The fright, in turn, caused
the adult mink to eat their young. Powell has suf-
fered serious economic loss due to the fact that
one-third of his animals have been killed. He is
asserting a claim for damages against Davis
Construction Company.

32. Powell will

(A) prevail, because Davis is strictly liable
for the harm caused by the blasting

(B) prevail for trespass, because the fright

due to the vibrations caused the mink to
eat their young

(C) not prevail, because strict liability does
not pertain to purely economic loss
(D) not prevail, because the harm to the

mink was not a foreseeable result of the

switch on a motorized three wheel forklift, which
the company regularly used at its factory. The fork-
lift had been purchased by Warehouse from
Equipto, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of
heavy duty factory equipment, two years ago.

The ignition switch that Leff was working on was
located near the two rear wheels. After removing
the old defective switch, Leff than attempted to
insert the new ignition switch that he purchased
from Wigeto, Inc., a parts distributor. When the
new ignition switch "popped out" of the socket,
Leff tried to reinsert it. As he did so, the forklift
engine suddenly started and dragged Leff under-
neath the rear axle, injuring him. The new ignition
switch that Leff was installing had been manufac-
tured by Manufacto, Inc. and was specially
designed for Equipto forklift models.

34. If Leff brings a claim against Manufacto
alleging that the new ignition switch was
defective and unreasonably dangerous, Leff
will

recover, if such an accident was foresee-
able and Manufacto failed to warn pur-
chasers of the danger
recover, if Manufacto advertised the
ignition switch as "a safe and effective
starter switch" for such forklift models
not recover, if a reasonably prudent
mechanic would have stopped trying to
reinsert the ignition switch after it had
"popped out" of the socket

Al Key was a 1986 graduate of the Lake Tahoe
School of Law. For many years Al tried to pass the
Nevada bar exam but was never successful. In a
state of despair, Al turned to alcohol as a panacea
for his depression. For twenty years, Al was a

gin. It was not uncommon for Al to drink a pint of
Boodles on a daily basis.

In 2006 Al learned that he was dying from cirrhosis

Suzi Chaplips, on a winter vacation in Colorado,
visited a ski resort owned and operated by Aspen.
After paying $40 for her ski-lift ticket, Suzi entered
the resort and spent the day skiing along Aspen's
intermediate slopes. Suzi, who was an experienced
skier, was making her last downhill run of the after-
noon when it began to snow quite heavily. Noticing
that there were many skiers on the intermediate ski
path, Suzi decided to ski along the outer edge of the
ski trail which bordered along a heavily wooded
area. Hampered by the poor visibility, Suzi struck
an exposed tree root which was concealed by loose
snow and fell, breaking her ankle.

39. Aspen had erected the following sign which
was visible to all skiers entering the resort:
"Welcome to Aspen where we provide you
with the smoothest and safest ski slopes in
Colorado." Suzi, who had read the sign when
she entered the resort, asserts a claim for
damages against Aspen based on negligence.
Aspen contends that Suzi's cause of action is
barred by the defense of assumption of risk.

Grad recently graduated from State College with a
degree in accounting. He applied for a job in the
accounting department of Krandall's Department
Store. As part of the application process Grad was
required to list the names of character references.
Grad listed Prof, one of his college professors, as a
character reference.

Rose Evans, Krandall's employment director,
processed Grad's employment application. She con-
tacted Prof to ask her some questions about Grad's
character. In the course of their conversation, Rose
said to Prof, "If Grad gets the job he will be
responsible for taking the daily receipts, counting
them, entering the totals into the ledgers and then
depositing the receipts in the bank. He will be
working with large sums of money, so we need to
know if he is an honest individual." Prof responded
that she believed Grad to be a very honest person.
Rose then asked, "Has Grad ever been convicted of
any theft crime?" Even though Prof did not know
anything about Grad's background or life outside
the classroom, including whether Grad had ever
been convicted of a crime, she answered,
"Absolutely not. Grad is a very honest person." As
a result of Prof's recommendation, Krandall's hired
Grad to work in their accounting department.

Six months later, Krandall's discovered that Grad
had embezzled $50,000 over the course of his
employment. At Grad's trial for theft, evidence was
introduced that Grad had stolen money from the
campus bookstore while he was a student at State
College and had been convicted of larceny for that
offense. He had returned the money and received a
suspended sentence. Grad was subsequently found
guilty of theft from Krandall's and sentenced to 2
years imprisonment. Krandall's was unable to
recover the embezzled money.

40. If Krandall's asserts a claim against Prof for

deceit, Krandall's will

she said that Grad was an honest person

whether Grad had been convicted of a

41. Disease Care has filed a motion for summary
judgment asserting that the McMartin's law-
suit is groundless and not supported by any
factual evidence. The motion should be

granted, because the children's fears are
unreasonable and cannot be substanti-
ated by scientific data
granted, because Disease Care is making
reasonable use of its property and con-
struction of the clinic does not violate
existing zoning laws
denied, because even though the chil-
dren's belief is unreasonable, McMartin
has demonstrated that he will suffer
injury from the proposed construction
denied, if, and only if, in "balancing the
equities" the court determines that
McMartin's pre-school operation out-
weighs the utility of defendant's enter-
prise

Question 41 is based on the following fact situation.

McMartin owns and operates a pre-school facility
in the city of Baskerville. The children attending
the McMartin pre-school are all three, four and five
years of age. McMartin has been operating his pre-
school in Baskerville for twenty consecutive years.

Recently, McMartin has learned that Disease Care, a
company providing treatment to AIDS patients, pur-
chased the property next to her pre-school. Disease
Care has informed McMartin and other residents in
the community that it plans to construct a treatment
clinic for AIDS patients next to the pre-school.

When the children at McMartin's pre-school
learned that an AIDS clinic was about to be built
next-door, they became hysterical with fear. The
children believed that AIDS was contagious and
they would become infected by germs transmitted
from the clinic. As a result, the parents informed
McMartin that if the clinic was built, they would
have to remove their children from his pre-school.
Clearly, the children's belief was unreasonable and
not supported by relevant scientific data.
Nonetheless, the children could not be dissuaded in
their unfound fear of contracting AIDS.

McMartin realized that if Disease Care went ahead
and constructed the AIDS clinic, he would be
forced to close his pre-school and suffer severe eco-
nomic loss. Consequently, McMartin filed suit
against Disease Care seeking to enjoin construction
of the AIDS clinic. He claimed that the clinic
would constitute a nuisance and substantially inter-
fere with the operation of his pre-school. The con-
struction of the clinic does not violate zoning laws
currently in effect.

Question 42 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 43 is based on the following fact situation.

Peter Petsky is the owner of Pet Products Company
which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a
variety of pet supplies. Peter's company manufac-
tures such products as pet furniture, toys, beds, col-
lars, leashes, cages, vitamins, etc. These items are
distributed to pet stores throughout the United
States and Europe. Since 2000, Pet Products has
conducted its operations from a large factory
located in the town of Bismark. One of Peter's
biggest selling products is a specially manufac-
tured high frequency dog-calling whistles. These
whistles are sold to dog training schools and kennel
divisions of many police departments. Although
these whistles are not audible to people, they are
audible to dogs over considerable distances.

In 2007, Rula Lenska purchased an undeveloped lot
in Bismark. On her property Rula constructed a Pet
Hotel which was used as a boarding kennel for dogs
and cats. This boarding facility was situated about
100 yards from Peter's factory. Unknown to Rula,
high frequency sound waves often emitted from
Peter's factory when dog-calling whistles were
being tested. These sound waves caused Rula's dogs
to howl uncontrollably for many hours during the
day and seriously interfered with the operation of
her business.

42. Rula now brings an action against Peter and

the Pet Products Company to recover damages
for the interference with her business caused
by the high frequency sound that reaches her
kennel. The court should rule in favor of

Peter, because Rula came to the nui-
sance after his factory had already been
in operation for a number of years.
Peter, because Rula's business is abnor-
mally sensitive to harm caused by the
high frequency sound waves
Rula, because the high frequency sound
waves constitute a trespass to Rula's
premises.
Rula, because the high frequency sound
waves have seriously interfered with the
operation of her business.

Hank owned a secondhand goods store. He often
placed merchandise on the sidewalk, sometimes for
short intervals, sometimes from 7:00 a.m. until 6:00
p.m. Pedestrians from time to time stopped and
gathered to look at the merchandise. Fred had
moved into an apartment which was situated imme-
diately above Hank's store. A street-level stairway
entrance was located about twenty feet to the east.
On several occasions, Fred had complained to Hank
about the situation because not only were his view
and peace of mind affected, but his travel on the
sidewalk was made more difficult. Fred owned and
managed a restaurant two blocks to the west of his
apartment and made frequent trips back and forth.
There was a back entrance to his apartment through
a parking lot, but this entrance was about two hun-
dred feet farther in walking distance from his
restaurant. Once Fred complained to the police,
whereupon Hank was arrested under a local ordi-
nance which prohibited the placing of goods or
merchandise on public sidewalks and imposed, as
its sole sanction, a fine for its violation.

One day, the sidewalk in front of Hank's store was
unusally cluttered because he was cleaning and
mopping the floor of his shop. Fred and his fifteen-
year-old son, Steve, saw a bus they wished to take,
and they raced down the stairs and onto the clut-
tered sidewalk in front of Hank's store, Fred in the
lead. While dodging merchandise and people, Fred
fell. Steve tripped over him and suffered a broken
arm. Fred also suffered broken bones and was
unable to attend to his duties for six weeks.

43. If, prior to the day of his personal injuries,

Fred had asserted a claim based on public nui-
sance for injunctive relief against Hank for his
obstruction of the sidewalk in violation of the
ordinance, the defense on which Hank would
have most likely prevailed is that

(B)

(A) Fred consented to the obstruction by
continuing to rent his apartment
the violation of the ordinance was not
unreasonable
the remedy of abatement by self-help
was adequate
there was no claim for special damages

Rusty Rutledge had been a member of the police
force of the town of Calypso for eight years. One
day, while he was sitting at his desk at police head-
quarters preparing an accident investigation report,
police commissioner Jay Ellsworth approached
patrolman Rutledge and said, "Rusty, I'm very dis-
appointed in you. Read this letter I just received."

Rusty unfolded the paper he was handed and read:

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

"George, if I were you, I wouldn't let
Henry go out on a date with your daugh-
ter. He has been known to rape his girl-
friends."
"George, if I were you, I wouldn't let
Henry treat your nephew for stomach
pains. Henry is a quack and doesn't
know how to make a proper diagnosis."
"George, if I were you, I wouldn't let
Henry visit your mother. Henry would
have stabbed his own mother to death
last week, if she hadn't been suddenly
killed in an auto accident."
"George, if I were you, I wouldn't call
Henry for treatment in an emergency.
He's a drunkard, and once he wasn't able
to treat Jimmy because Henry was too
intoxicated."

"Dear Commissioner Ellsworth:

I am a concerned citizen of Calypso and
request that patrolman Rusty Rutledge be
restricted from carrying a weapon to his res-
idence at 1231 Marshall Lane. Mr. Rutledge
has tormented neighbors with foul language,
has displayed a violent temper, has threat-
ened little children and kicked pets. His
conduct is most disgraceful as a human
being and also as a public person.

Sincerely,
Roger Chase"

Rusty immediately jumped up from his chair,
banged on the desk and screamed, "I do NOT have
a violent temper!" He left the room, slamming the
door behind him.

45. In a defamation suit by Rusty against Roger,
Roger will likely point to the fact that:

There was no implied malice in the let-
ter, even though it might technically be
considered slander.
All public employees are public offi-
cials, and therefore Rusty may not
recover any damages.
Law enforcement is a uniquely govern-
mental affair, and police officers have a
substantial responsibility for the safety
and welfare of the citizens.
Since Rusty was not fired from the
police force as result of the letter, there
are no damages he may recover in a
defamation action.

Question 46 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 47 is based on the following fact situation.

Shannon Sharp and Elena Cantillo were members
of the freshman class at Vanderbilt University.
Shannon and Elena both went out for the cheerlead-
ing squad. After Shannon beat out Elena for the last
cheerleading position, Elena became very jealous
of Shannon. A short while later, Elena's boyfriend,
Miles Marlow, began dating Shannon. When Elena
learned about Shannon's relationship with Miles,
she boiled with anger.

She immediately telephoned Miles intending to
berate him on his reprehensible conduct. When no
one answered the phone, Elena decided to leave a
message on Miles' answering machine. Whenever
Elena got angry, she instinctively spoke in her
native tongue of Spanish. Elena thus left the follow-
ing message in Spanish on Miles' answering
machine, "Miles, you're a louse. I hope you trans-
mit the gonorrhea virus to Shannon that you gave
me." Although Elena knew that Miles had not
infected her with gonorrhea, nonetheless she
wanted him to worry that he had a venereal disease.

Later that same night, Miles and Shannon returned
to his apartment after going out to dinner. When
they arrived, Miles turned on his answering
machine and played Elena's message. Miles, who
spoke fluent Spanish, understood Elena's message.
Shannon heard the message but didn't understand it
because she didn't know Spanish. When Shannon
asked Miles what Elena had said, Miles lied and
told her that Elena had wished him a "Happy
Birthday".

46. If Miles asserts a defamation action against

Elena, he will most likely

(A) prevail, because he understood the true

meaning of her defamatory statement

(B) prevail, because the statement was over-

heard by Shannon

(C) not prevail, because the message was
communicated to Miles' personal
answering machine and not intended for
outside publication

(D) not prevail, because Shannon didn't

Klowner Inc., a company engaged in the business
of legal publications, has its principal corporate
headquarters in the city of Loyola. From 2003 to
2006, Josephina Michaelson was the president and
chief executive officer of Klowner. During
Michaelson's tenure, Klowner lost approximately
$11,000,000. Due to the company's sorrowful per-
formance, the Board of Directors terminated
Michaelson's employment contract in January, 2007
and discharged her.

Michaelson, who taught part-time as a law profes-
sor at Loyola Law School, was well known in the
community and active in civil affairs. Her dismissal
was a newsworthy event and received considerable
publicity on television and in the newpapers.
Following the announcement of Michaelson's termi-
nation, Barry Brothers, a spokesman for the
Klowner Board of Directors, held a news confer-
ence attended by various media reporters. During a
question and answer period, Brothers was asked
why Michaelson had been dismissed. In response to
the question, Brothers said, "That's simple. The
company lost a small fortune because she was a
poor administrator."

47. If Michaelson asserts a claim against Brothers
for damages for defamation, will Michaelson
prevail?

(A) No, because Klowner did, in fact, lose

$11,000,000 during Michaelson's tenure.

(B) No, based on a qualified privilege, if

Brothers' statement at the news confer-
ence was made in the public interest.

(C) Yes, because Brother's statement

reflected adversely on Michaelson's pro-
fessional competence.

(D) Yes, if Brothers acted with malice and

knew that Klowner's losses were not
Michaelson's fault.

Olivia Ortiz lived in Miami with her husband and
three children. Olivia was carrying on an illicit love
affair with Reese Reno, a boyfriend, who lived in
Ft. Lauderdale. While her husband and children
were away on a fishing trip, Olivia decided to
spend the weekend with Reese at the Bayshore
Resort and Spa. As Olivia and Reese were passion-
ately making love in their room, a fire broke out in
the main building of the hotel. When the fire
alarms sounded, all the guests hurriedly left their
rooms and converged outside.

The fire department arrived and fought to bring the
conflagration under control. Meanwhile, two
reporters and a photographer from the Miami
Herald newspaper were dispatched to the hotel to
report on the fire. While Olivia and Reese were
standing together in bathrobes outside watching the
fire, the newspaper photographer took their picture
without their knowledge. The next day Olivia and
Reese's picture appeared on the front page of the
Miami Herald.

As a result of her picture appearing in the newspa-
per, Olivia's life has become a living nightmare.
Her husband filed for divorce. Many old friends
have shunned her due to her amoral conduct. The

Question 50 is based on the following fact situation.

Howard Kosale published a book entitled Baseball's
Most Exciting Moments. The book contained a
chapter on Mickey Marvel, a Hall of Fame center-
fielder, who played his major league career with the
New York Yankees. In highlighting Marvel's
exploits, Kosale wrote about the famous 1957
World Series between the New York Yankees and
the Brooklyn Dodgers. In the book Kosale por-
trayed Marvel as having played a decisive role in
the Yankees' winning the 1957 World Series. Kosale
noted that Marvel hit a clutch home run and made a
key catch in the final game of the series. In fact,
Marvel did not even play in the final game of the
1957 World Series because he suffered from a
severe case of shingles.

Kosale knew that Marvel didn't play in the final
game of the series. Moreover, Kosale was aware
that Marvel didn't hit any home runs in the 1957
World Series. However, he included those passages
to enhance the sensationalism and promotion of the
book. After reading Kosale's book, Marvel was
embarrassed and highly offended by the deliber-
ately false story line.

50. If Marvel asserts a claim for damages against
Kosale based on defamation and invasion of
privacy, Marvel will

(A)

(B)

(C)

recover for invasion of privacy only,
because the book falsely portrayed
Marvel's baseball career
recover for defamation only, because
some of the representations of Marvel's
career were known by Kosale to be fic-
tional and were likely to be offensive to
Marvel
recover for both defamation and inva-
sion of privacy

(D) not recover for either defamation or

Anders conveyed her only parcel of land to Burton
by a duly executed and delivered warranty deed,
which provided:

"To have and to hold the described tract of land in
fee simple, subject to the understanding that within
one year from the date of the instrument said
grantee shall construct and thereafter maintain and
operate on said premises a public health center."

The grantee, Burton, constructed a public health
center on the tract within the time specified and
operated it for five years. At the end of this period,
Burton converted the structure into a senior citi-
zens' recreational facility. It is conceded by all par-
ties in interest that a senior citizens' recreational
facility is not a public health center.

In an appropriate action, Anders seeks a dec-
laration that the change in the use of the facil-
ity has caused the land and structure to revert
to her. In this action, Anders should

win, because the language of the deed
created a determinable fee, which leaves
a possibility of reverter in the grantor
win, because the language of the deed
created a fee subject to condition subse-
quent, which leaves a right of entry or
power of termination in the grantor

created only a contractual obligation and

Gilbert was the owner in fee simple of

Jagger or his successors shall use the property for
other than residential purposes during the next 30
years, then the grantor or his successors may re-
enter and resume the former estate." After Jagger
took possession of Meadowlands, he constructed a
single-family dwelling and resided on the property
with his family. In 2003, Jagger and his wife,
Jasper, died in an automobile accident, leaving a
son, Jared, as their sole heir. Jared, who was an
attorney, took sole possession of Meadowlands after
the death of his parents. He then built an addition
on the dwelling which he converted into a law
office. As the only lawyer in the surrounding area,
Jared developed a lucrative law practice out of his
house. One day, Gilbert, who was still alive, was
driving past Meadowlands and noticed that Jared
was operating a law office on the property.
Thereupon, Gilbert demanded that Jared surrender
possession because the nonresidential use meant
that he (Gilbert) once again owned Meadowlands in
fee simple. Jared refused.

If it is determined that Gilbert was wrong
concerning his statement that he is now the
fee simple owner of Meadowlands, it is
because

(A)

(B)

the limitation on Jagger's fee simple was
effective only during Jagger's lifetime

Able recorded the deed and immediately told Baker
that he, Able, was going to begin charging Baker
rent since, "I am now your landlord." There is no

Able and Baker did not reach agreement, and Able
served the appropriate notice to terminate whatever
tenancy Baker had. Able then sought, in an appro-

Kristofferson is the owner of Seaview, a 30-acre
tract, located in the Malibu hills and overlooking
the Pacific Ocean. Kristofferson, who was 70 years
of age, was divorced and had two children, Bobby
and McGee. Kristofferson, a devoted family man,
wanted to keep the property intact for future gener-
ations of Kristoffersons. As such, he conveyed
Seaview "to Bobby and McGee and their heirs as
joint tenants, not tenants in common." In the deed
of conveyance Kristofferson included a provision
whereby "Bobby and McGee and their heirs
covenant not to partition the property forever."

Thereafter Bobby and McGee took possession of
Seaview. Bobby then married Janis whom McGee
disliked intensely. This marriage caused a great deal
of friction between the brothers who began arguing
about management of the property. Bobby finally
decided to seek a partition of the property so that
he and Janis would not have any future dealings
with McGee. After Bobby brought suit to partition
Seaview, McGee moved for summary judgment
challenging the relief sought.

10. The equity court should rule in favor of

(A) Bobby, because the covenant not to par-

tition is void as violative of the Rule
Against Perpetuities

(B) Bobby, because private action cannot

override judicial authority

(C) McGee, because the covenant not to par-

tition is enforceable and runs with the
land

(D) McGee, because a joint tenancy is not

partitionable

The Miami Marlins is a professional baseball team
that plays its home games at the Fish Bowl. Ricardo
Renteria purchased season tickets to the Marlins
baseball games. Ricardo was an avid fan who
attended every home game. At the start of the sea-
son Hugh Zinger, the Marlins' owner, traded away
all the top players on the team. Consequently, the
Marlins performed pitifully and began losing prac-
tically every game.

Ricardo became disgusted with the Marlins and
blamed Zinger for the team's lousy performance. In
protest, Ricardo began wearing a placard at the Fish
Bowl which read, "BOYCOTT THE
MARLINS...ZING ZINGER." During the games
Ricardo would march around the stadium with his
placard and begin chanting: "Zinger sucks...Zinger
sucks."

As the season progressed, the fans became disgrun-
tled and joined Ricardo in his protests. Soon there-
after, Ricardo received a notice from the Marlins'
management revoking his season tickets. Ricardo
was informed that he would not be allowed to
attend any more Marlins games, but would receive
full reimbursement for all remaining games.

Question 13 is based on the following fact situation.

In 1970, Benji was the record owner in fee simple
absolute of Greenacre, a 30-acre parcel of land in
Suburb. Benji lived in a farmhouse on Greenacre
and used the tract to raise produce for local sale.
On a section of Greenacre was a sand pit containing
a large quantity of sand having commercial value.
In 1984, Benji in a written instrument granted
Chard "during his lifetime the right to come onto
Greenacre and take any or all sand which he can
find thereon." Chard was engaged in the business
of selling sand to contractors for road construction
projects.

For the next 20 years, Chard dug and used the sand
from Greenacre. In 2005, however, the state govern-
ment notified Benji that it had decided to take
Greenacre by eminent domain. As a consequence,
Chard will no longer be able to enter Greenacre to
remove sand.

13. Chard was correctly named as one of the par-
ties to the condemnation hearing that was
held. What condemnation award, if anything,
will Chard be entitled to recover?

(A) Nothing, because Chard had a mere

license.

(B) Nothing, because Chard had an equi-

table servitude.

(C) The current value of net income that he
would have received during Benji's life-
time.

(D) The current value of net income he

would have received had there not been
a condemnation.

Question 14 is based on the following fact situation.

Erickson owned Hillacre, a ten acre tract of land, in
fee simple. Hillacre was located in the township of
Deer Valley. In 1979, Erickson conveyed Hillacre to
The Downhill Development Association "on condi-
tion that a ski lodge and resort area be built thereon
and the land be used solely for skiing purposes and,
in the event that said property is not used as a ski
resort, the property shall revert to myself, the
grantor, my heirs or assigns." Subsequently, a ski
lodge was built and the land was continuously used
as a ski resort for over twenty years.

In 1984, Stein, owner of Grassacre, a property abut-
ting the northeast corner of Hillacre, began to use a
portion of Hillacre in order to gain access to
Grassacre for ingress and egress. He used this
access road openly, visibly and notoriously until
2005. The period of prescription in this particular
jurisdiction was 20 years. In March, 2005, he
decided to sell Grassacre to Grich for the purchase
price of $500,000. Thereupon, Stein and Grich
entered into a written real estate sales contract with
closing set for May 1, 2005.

On April 1, 2005, Downer, the president of The
Downhill Development Association, was
approached by Grich with the request that a written
easement be given over the access road and that an
appropriate instrument be delivered to Grich con-
currently with Grich's closing with Stein. Following
Downer's meeting with Grich, The Downhill
Development Association held a duly announced
meeting and voted unanimously to authorize its
trustees to grant such an easement.

On April 15, 2005, Erickson died. Erickson's sole
descendant and successor in interest was he wife,
Erika. Upon her husband's death, she immediately
notified The Downhill Development Association
that if it granted the easement to Grich, Hillacre
would revert to her. Grich then brought an appropri-
ate action, joining Stein, Erika and The Downhill
Development Association, seeking a declaratory
judgment that Stein has a perpetual easement
appurtenant to Hillacre.

14. In this action, judgment should be in favor of

which of the following parties?

Erika, because Grich could not obtain
rights against The Downhill
Development Association by
prescription.
Erika, because the easement would vio-
late the negative restriction that Erikson
originally sought to impose.
Grich, because Stein had already
obtained an easement by prescription.
Grich, because the language of the con-
veyance to The Downhill Development
Association was too vague to support
any claim by Erika.

Question 15 is based on the following fact situation.

Questions 16-17 are based on the following fact situation.

Fegen owned two adjacent ten story commercial
buildings in Beverly Hills. The buildings were
respectively known as Trump Towers and Galleria
Plaza. The first floors of both buildings were occu-
pied by various retail establishments. The building's
other floors were rented to tenants and used as
offices. There was an enclosed walkway which con-
nected the second floor of each building. Thus,
shoppers and office workers could walk across the
common walkway and gain access to each building.

While the buildings were being used in this manner,
Fegen sold Trump Towers to Toyota by warranty
deed, which made no mention of any rights con-
cerning the walkway. The walkway continued to be
used by the occupants of both buildings. Thereafter,
the walkway became unsafe as a consequence of
wear and tear.

As a result, Toyota hired a contractor to repair the
walkway. When Fegen saw the contractor removing
the carpeting along the walkway, he demanded that
Toyota discontinue the repair work. After Toyota
refused, Fegen brought an action to enjoin Toyota
from continuing the work.

15. The most likely result will be a decision for

(A) Fegen, because Toyota does not have

rights in the walkway

(B) Fegen, because Toyota's rights in Trump

Towers do not extend to the walkway
(C) Toyota, because Toyota has an easement
in the walkway, and an implied right to
keep the walkway in repair

(D) Toyota, because he has a right to take

whatever action is necessary to protect
himself from possible tort liability from
persons using the walkway

Blackacre and Whiteacre are adjoining tracts of
land located in Fillmore County. In 1993, Bix pur-
chased Blackacre, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple
absolute. Whiteacre, a 20-acre tract situated to the
north of Blackacre, was owned by Wing in fee sim-
ple absolute. Cobb, a remote predecessor of Bix,
had granted to Zorn, a way for egress and ingress
across Blackacre under such terms and circum-
stances that an easement appurtenant to Whiteacre
was created. This right-of-way was executed by
deed and properly recorded. Zorn, however, never
made any actual use of the right-of-way.

In 2006, Wing conveyed Whiteacre to Bix. The next
year, Bix conveyed Whiteacre by deed to Dowd for
a consideration of $250,000, receipt of which was
acknowledged. Neither the Wing-Bix deed nor the
Bix-Dowd deed contained any reference to the
easement for right-of-way. Dowd has now claimed
that she has a right-of-way across Blackacre. Bix,
on the other hand, has informed Dowd that no such
easement exists.

16. Assume for the purpose of this question only

that both Blackacre and Whiteacre abut a pub-
lic highway and that ingress and egress are
afforded Dowd by that highway. In an appro-
priate action by Dowd to determine her right
to use the right-of-way across Blackacre, she

Question 18 is based on the following fact situation.

Aboo is the owner of an abandoned ranch consist-
ing of 4000 acres. He intends to develop the entire
property as a recreational, commercial, and light
industrial area. A corporation will own and operate
the recreational facilities, consisting of an indoor
arena for basketball, ice hockey and related sport-
ing events, and an outdoor amusement park. Stock
in the corporation will be distributed to the owners
of lots in the commercial portions of the subdivi-
sion, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen
until all the commercial lots are sold.

Aboo realizes that he must create a scheme of
development that will offer prospective purchasers
a very high order of assurance that several aspects
will be clearly established:

1. There must be no use of land for heavy industrial
or any other purpose which would negatively
affect operation of the recreational facilities.

2. The owners of commercial lots in the subdivision
must have an unambiguous right to participate in
the profits generated by the recreational facili-
ties.

3. Each lot owner must have an unambiguous right
to transfer her lot to a purchaser with all original
benefits.

4. Each commercial lot owner must be obligated to
make annual payments of a pro rata share (based
on the number of lots) of the first five years' pro-
jected annual operating deficit of the recreational
facilities (whether or not such owner desires to
participate in the profits ultimately generated by
said facilities).

18. In the context of all aspects of the scheme,
which of the following will offer the best
chance of implementing the requirement that
each lot owner be obligated to make annual
payments of a pro rata share of the first five
years' projected annual operating deficit of
the recreational facilities?

(A) Covenant.
(B) Easement.
(C) Mortgage.
(D) Personal contractual obligation by each

Question 19 is based on the following fact situation.

19. One of the 100 lots owned by Redford was

sold to Wilson. Verde, who purchased a pas-
sive-solar home from Muir on a lot adjacent
to Wilson's, learned that Wilson intended to
heat his home with a coal-burning furnace,
which would spew coal dust into the sur-
rounding area. Verde brought an appropriate
action against Wilson to enjoin construction
of the home heated by the coal-burning fur-
nace. What will be the probable outcome of
this litigation?

Verde will prevail, because he can
enforce the implied reciprocal servitude
relating to passive-solar heating against
Wilson.
Verde will prevail, because Wilson's use
of a coal-burning furnace may depress
property values in the surrounding area.
Wilson will prevail, because the passive-
solar restriction was not mentioned in
the deed by which he took his property.
Wilson will prevail, because he was
never in privity with Muir.

Wishing to promote energy conservation and a
renewable resource lifestyle, Muir obtained the
appropriate governmental approval to subdivide her
200 acre parcel into 300 half-acre residential lots
surrounding a 50-acre wooded "greenbelt." Muir
recorded a subdivision plat for this project, which
Muir named Greenhome; the plat showed the 300
lots plus an area congruent with the 50-acre green-
belt, labelled on the plat as "City Park."

Muir built 200 passive-solar homes in Greenhome
and sold them to individual purchasers via warranty
deeds each of which referred to the recorded subdi-
vision plat and contained a restriction that "only
single family residences using passive-solar energy
systems as their primary source of heating may be
constructed hereon."

While there were still 100 unsold lots in
Greenhome, Muir sold these remaining properties
and the 50-acre greenbelt to Redford. The Muir-
Redford deed referred to the subdivision plat and
contained the restriction limiting construction to
passive-solar homes. Redford sold the 100 lots as
undeveloped properties to individual purchasers.
During the same period, Redford conveyed the 50-
acre greenbelt to Lukens, in exchange for cancella-
tion of a debt owed by Redford to Lukens. Redford
failed to include in the deeds executed by him any
mention of the subdivision plat or the restriction
limiting construction to passive-solar residences.

Each of the deeds involved in the sale of
Greenhome properties was promptly and properly

In 1980, Jack Sikma purchased Tall Pines, an
80-acre tract just outside Cedar Rapids in Forest
County. Tall Pines included the family home,
Montecello, an exquisite mansion built in 1929 by
a wealthy industrialist named Nelson Tweed. For
many years, Cedar Rapids had been in the grips of
economic decline. However, in 1988 and 1989
I.B.M., A.T.T. and other large corporations built
plant facilities in the local area.

By the early 2000s, prosperity burst upon Cedar
Rapids. To take advantage of the real estate boom,
Sikma divided Tall Pines into 160 lots. By 2006,
Sikma had sold 90 lots to various individual buyers.
Each deed contained the following provisions:

"It is an express covenant and condition that
the property hereby conveyed shall not be
used for other than single family residences."

In 2007, the Forest County Board of Supervisors
purchased 30 lots within Tall Pines from Sikma.
The Board, which had the power of eminent
domain, planned to construct a new County
Noxious Weed & Rodent Pest Control Office on
the property. The deed of conveyance from Sikma
to the Forest County Board of Supervisors made
no mention of the aforesaid restrictions contained
in the deeds to other Tall Pines' lot owners. The
Sikma-Forest County deed, however, did contain a
provision which stated:

"The grantee hereby covenants for itself, its
successors and assigns that this conveyance
is made in lieu of the exercise of the power of
eminent domain."

Thereafter, Forest County enacted a zoning ordi-
nance whereby the 30 lots were rezoned to permit
the construction of a Noxious Weed & Rodent Pest
Control Office building. When the county started

Pam and Dora own adjoining lots in the central por-

her lot and to erect a building of greater height.
Dora has received all governmental approvals
required to pursue her project.

There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other
than those dealing with various approvals for zon-
ing, building, etc.).

After Dora had torn down the existing building, she
proceeded to excavate deeper. Dora used shoring
that met all local, state, and federal safety regula-
tions, and the shoring was placed in accordance
with those standards.

Pam notified Dora that cracks were developing in
the building situated on Pam's lot. Dora took the
view that any subsidence suffered by Pam was due
to the weight of Pam's building, and correctly
asserted that none would have occurred had Pam's
soil been in its natural state. Dora continued to
excavate. The building on Pam's lot did suffer
extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of

concerning Pam's action to recover damages
from Dora?

(A) Dora is liable, because she removed nec-

essary support for Pam's lot.

(B) Dora cannot be held liable simply upon

proof that support was removed, but may
be held liable if negligence is proved.

(C) Once land is improved with a building,
the owner cannot invoke the common-
law right of lateral support.

(D) Dora's only obligation was to satisfy all

local, state, and federal safety regula-

Winston owned a 100-acre farm in Salem. For
many years, Winston grew tobacco on a 10-acre
strip located in the northeast section of the prop-
erty. In March, Winston planted his annual tobacco
crop which he usually harvested in early October.
In September, Winston sold his farm to Raleigh
for $100,000. At the time Winston conveyed the
property to Raleigh, the tobacco crop was well
developed and quite mature. When Winston and
Raleigh entered into their land sale agreement,
there was no mention of the status or ownership
of the tobacco crop.

In early October, after Raleigh took possession of
the property, Winston contacted him and requested
permission to harvest and remove the tobacco crop.
Raleigh refused to allow Winston to re-enter the
property.

29. Winston brings suit against Raleigh seeking to

re-enter the property and remove the tobacco
crop which he had planted. Which of the fol-
lowing is correct regarding the respective
rights of the parties?

Winston is entitled to remove the
tobacco crop, but he must pay Raleigh a
reasonable value to enter the property
thus gaining access to the crop.
Winston is entitled to remove the
tobacco crop, and is not required to pay
Raleigh for entering the property thus
gaining access to the crop.
Winston is not entitled to remove the
tobacco crop, and, thus is not entitled to
re-enter the property.
Winston and Raleigh each have a col-
orable title to the tobacco crop, and con-
sequently there should be an equitable
division of the proceeds from the sale of
the crop between both parties.

30. Inasmuch as Crystal Stream is still flowing at

a very low level and Carson is continuing to
take water for his personal needs, there is
insufficient water to irrigate Grasslands. As a
consequence, DuVall brings an appropriate
action to declare that his water rights to the
stream are superior to those of Carson. In
addition, DuVall moves to have the full flow
of Crystal Stream passed to him, notwith-
standing the effect it might have on Carson. If
this state follows the doctrine of prior appro-
priation, judgment for whom?

Carson, because as an upstream
landowner, he would have superior
rights to the water than a downstream
owner.
Carson, because domestic use is supe-
rior to and is protected against agricul-
tural use.
DuVall, because he has obtained an
easement by prescription to remove as
much water as he may need.
DuVall, because he has put the water to
a beneficial use prior to Carson's use
and has continuously used the water.

Question 30 is based on the following fact situation.

Carson is the owner of a parcel of land known as
Tall Acres which is situated upon the top of Candy
Rock Mountain. Located below Tall Acres is
Grasslands, a forty acre hillside estate which is
owned by DuVall. Crystal Stream is a non-naviga-
ble watercourse that originates at the top of Candy
Rock mountain and runs all the way down into the
San Vicente Valley. Both Tall Acres and Grasslands
are within the watershed of Crystal Stream.

When DuVall purchased Grasslands in 1976, he
started taking water from Crystal Stream and used
it to irrigate the southern half of his property which
he has used as a farm. Prior to 1976, the southern
half of Grasslands had been cleared and placed in
cultivation, while the northern half remained
wooded and unused except for an occasional hike
or gathering of timber for use as domestic fuel.
DuVall continued this established pattern of use.
Now (January 2007), he is still taking water from
Crystal Stream and using it to irrigate the southern
half of Grasslands.

In 2005, Carson built a home on Tall Acres and
started taking water from Crystal Stream for
domestic purposes. During that year there was
heavy rainfall, and this caused Crystal Stream to
run down the mountain to a high water level. The
next year, however, there was a drought. As a result,
Crystal Stream flowed at a very low level.
Consequently, there was only enough water to irri-
gate DuVall's farmland or, in the alternative, to sup-
ply all of Carson's domestic water needs and
one-quarter of DuVall's irrigation requirements.
Candy Rock Mountain is located in a jurisdiction
where the period of prescription is fifteen years.

Question 31 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 32 is based on the following fact situation.

Haddox and Virdon owned adjoining lots in the city
of Pottstown. Haddox constructed a house on his lot
and resided there with his wife and three children.
Virdon resided in Lancaster which was located 400
miles northwest of Pottstown. In 1986 Haddox built
a tennis court in the backyard of his lot. Unknown
to Haddox, the tennis court extended three feet onto
Virdon's lot. Virdon, who purchased her lot in
Pottstown in 1984 for investment purposes, had no
knowledge of the encroachment until 2007. In that
year, she returned to Pottstown for the first time
since 1984. When she inspected her lot, Virdon
ascertained that Haddox's tennis court extended
beyond the property line. The statutory period for
both adverse possession and prescriptive easements
is twenty years.

32. If Virdon brings an action against Haddox

alleging encroachment, the decision should be
for

(A) Virdon, since Haddox was unaware that

his possession was adverse

(B) Virdon, because Haddox has failed to

exercise any acts of dominion that would
exclude Virdon from the three-foot strip

(C) Haddox, because his possession was

hostile

(D) Haddox, because Virdon's conduct mani-
fests an intent to abandon any claim she
might have had to an exclusive right in

Younger is the fee simple owner of Hedgewood, a
20-acre tract of land, which is located in Oshkosh.
Younger inherited the property from his father but
didn't reside there. Younger lived in Key West,
Florida, where he owned a scuba diving business.

In 1995, Larson went into possession of
Hedgewood and lived there continuously for eight
years. During that period he held himself to be the
rightful owner of the property. His possession was
open, notorious, and exclusive. In 2003, Younger
visited Hedgewood and encountered Larson on the
property. Younger agreed to allow Larson to con-
tinue.114;LaCCPCCirin tinder a leasehold arrangement.
Younger proceeded to lease Hedgewood to Larson
for a two-year term at a rental fee of $2,000 per
month. The period of adverse possession in this
jurisdiction is 10 years.

Larson continued to reside on Hedgewood under
the terms of the lease agreement. When the two-
year lease expired in 2005, Larson claimed owner-
ship by adverse possession. He was in continuous
possession of Hedgewood for a period of ten years
with the prior eight years coupled with the two
years occupancy under the lease. Younger sought to
oust Larson from the property but Larson has
refused to vacate.

31. In an appropriate action to quiet title to

Hedgewood and resolve the conflicting own-
ership claims of Larson and Younger, the
court should rule in favor of

Larson, because he has been in continu-
ous possession of Hedgewood for the
statutory period
Larson, because his adverse possession
for the first eight years can be "tacked"
to the two years of the lease
Younger, because the lease agreement
presupposes that Larson's use was no
longer adverse

Question 34 is based on the following fact situation.

Mays owns Whiteacre, a 10-acre tract used for
agricultural purposes, in fee simple. On Whiteacre,
Mays maintains a dwelling house for himself and
his family. Mantle is the fee simple owner of
Blackacre, a 5-acre tract, which abuts Whiteacre.
In 1989 Mays began to erect a concrete wall along
the boundary line appurtenant to Blackacre. After
Mays started to build the wall, Mantle informed
him that he believed the wall was protruding onto
his property. Mays informed Mantle that he paid
$500 to have the boundary line surveyed. Mays
said that the surveyor indicated that the wall did
not encroach on Blackacre. Mantle accepted Mays'
assurances and in 2005 conveyed Blackacre to
Snider by warranty deed.

After Snider entered into possession of Blackacre,
he had the boundary line surveyed. The survey
conclusively showed that the concrete wall
extended two feet onto Blackacre. Although the
encroachment does not interfere with Snider's use
of Blackacre, he nevertheless demanded that Mays
remove the wall. Upon Mays' refusal, Snider
brought an appropriate action to have the wall
removed. The statutory period for adverse posses-
sion in the jurisdiction is 15 years.

34. The most likely result is that

(A) Mays must remove the wall at his own

expense

(B) Mays must remove the wall but at

Snider's expense

(C) Mays may leave the wall without being
liable to Snider for money damages
(D) Mays may leave the wall but he will be
liable to Snider for money damages

Arthur and Celia, brother and sister, both of legal
age, inherited Goodacre, their childhood home,
from their father. They thereby became tenants
in common.

Goodacre had never been used as anything except a
residence. Arthur had been residing on Goodacre
with his father at the time his father died. Celia had
been residing in a distant city. After their father's
funeral, Arthur continued to live on Goodacre, but
Celia returned to her own residence.

There was no discussion between Arthur and Celia
concerning their common ownership, nor had there
ever been any administration of their father's estate.
Arthur paid all taxes, insurance, and other carrying
charges on Goodacre. He paid no rent or other
compensation to Celia, nor did Celia request any
such payment.

Thirty years later, a series of disputes arose
between Arthur and Celia for the first time con-
cerning their respective rights to Goodacre. The
jurisdiction where the land is located recognizes the
usual common-law types of cotenancies, and there
is no applicable legislation on the subject.

33. If Arthur claims the entire title to Goodacre in

fee simple and brings an action against Celia
to quiet title in himself, and if the state where
the land is located has an ordinary 20-year
adverse possession statute, the decision
should be for

(A) Arthur, because during the past 30 years

Arthur has exercised the type of occu-
pancy ordinarily considered sufficient to
satisfy the adverse possession require-
ments

(B) Arthur, because the acts of the parties
indicate Celia acquiesced to Arthur's
right of ownership

(C) Celia, because there is no evidence that
Arthur has performed sufficient acts to
constitute her ouster

Question 35 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 36 is based on the following fact situation.

Taylor and Scott, an unmarried couple, purchased a
condominium as tenants in common and lived in
the condominium for three years. Subsequently,
they made a verbal agreement that, on the death of
either of them, the survivor would own the entire
condominium, and, as a result, they decided they
did not need wills.

Two years later, Taylor and Scott were involved in
the same automobile accident. Taylor was killed
immediately. Scott died one week later. Both died
intestate. Taylor's sole heir is her brother, Mark.
Scott's sole heir is his mother, Martha. Mark
claimed one-half of the condominium, and Martha
claimed all of it. The jurisdiction has no applicable
statute except for the Statute of Frauds, nor does it
recognize common-law marriages.

36. In an appropriate action by Martha claiming

the entire ownership of the condominium, the
court will find that

Martha owns the entire interest because
Taylor and Scott did not make wills in
reliance upon their oral agreement
Martha owns the entire interest because
she is entitled to reformation of the deed
to reflect the verbal agreement
Mark and Martha each own an undi-
vided one-half interest because Taylor
and Scott each died as the result of the
same accident
Mark and Martha each own an undi-
vided one-half interest because the
Statute of Frauds applies

Abdul owned Blackacre in fee simple. Blackacre
was a lot 100 feet wide and 375 feet long. The front
100 feet of Blackacre was subject to an easement
for street purposes and not usable by the owner as
long as Broad Street was used over such area.

Broad Street was 100 feet wide and the northeast
line of Blackacre formed the center line of Broad
Street for a distance of 100 feet. The long sides of
Blackacre extended southeast and northwest and
were perpendicular to Broad Street which extended
northeast and southwest.

Abdul executed a deed to Branca purporting to con-
vey a section of Blackacre. The deed contained the
following language:

"I, Abdul, hereby grant to Branca the follow-
ing described property to wit: Beginning at a
steel stake in the northeast side line of Broad
Street; thence north at a 90 degree angle west
200 feet; thence south at a 90 degree angle
west 50 feet; thence south at a 90 degree
angle east 200 feet; thence north at a 90
degree angle west 50 feet."

After receiving this instrument, Branca believed
that the deed failed to adequately describe the land
to be conveyed. He now seeks your advice as to
whether the deed instrument is sufficient to pass
title to Blackacre.

35. You should advise Branca as to the following:

The deed instrument does adequately
describe Blackacre and is sufficient to
pass title to the property.
The second course is in error, and if fol-
lowed as indicated there will be no land
enclosed and the deed will fail for indef-
initeness.
The third course is in error, and if fol-
lowed as indicated there will be no land
enclosed and the deed will fail for indef-
initeness.
The fourth course is in error, and if fol-
lowed as indicated there will be no land

Question 37 is based on the following fact situation.

In 1990, Rich Mann owned Towering Pines, a
forty acre tract fifteen-miles outside of Montpelier
in Vermont County. Towering Pines included the
Mann family home, called Casa Escobar, a decay-
ing 18th century mansion complete with swimming
pool and a second smaller house which was once
occupied by tenants who farmed Towering Pines.
The second house, however, had long been
vacant as the result of the economic decay of
Vermont County.

Prosperity burst upon Montpelier in 1991. Mann,
hoping to make some money, decided to break up
Towering Pines into one-acre lots and offer them
for sale. At first, demand was not strong, but Mann
managed to sell ten one-acre lots in 1991 and 1992
at an average price of $10,000 per acre.

By 1997, however, Mann had sold off thirty one-
acre lots, using an additional six acres for roads.
Mann retained only a four-acre tract which included
Casa Escobar and the former tenant's house. Early
in 1998, Mann received an irresistible offer from
Damon Dilworth for Casa Escobar. Dilworth, who
wanted to convert the aging mansion into a luxury
hotel, offered to pay $400,000 for Casa Escobar.
Although Casa Escobar had great sentimental value
to Mann, he reluctantly accepted Dilworth's offer.

In an ensuing oral agreement, Dilworth promised to
buy and Mann promised to sell Casa Escobar for
$400,000. Their agreement made no mention of a
specific closing date, financing, or deed descrip-
tion. Shortly thereafter, Dilworth sold his entire
stock portfolio for $450,000 and deposited the
proceeds in his money market account. He then
mailed Mann a certified check for $400,000 and
enclosed a letter stating that the check was to be
applied for the purchase price of Casa Escobar, as
per their oral agreement.

Daisy Dyson, a seventy-eight-year-old widow,
owned two properties in the state of New London.
She held record title to an exquisite three-story
Victorian home in the city of Portsmith and a ski
chalet in the mountain resort of Alta. Daisy exe-
cuted a warranty deed purporting to convey the
chalet to "my sister, Bessie, and my brother,
Sylvester, as joint tenants with right of survivor-
ship." The language in the deed instrument was suf-
ficient to create a joint tenancy, not a tenancy in
common, in this jurisdiction.

Before embarking on a vacation cruise to Europe,
Daisy mailed the deed to Bessie. Along with the
deed, Daisy attached the following note: "As you
know, I've always wanted you and Sylvester to have
my ski chalet. Enjoy yourselves while in Alta."
While the deed is in the mail, Bessie died intestate
after suffering a heart attack. She was survived by
her son, Blake, who was the sole heir. Thereafter,
Daisy left on her European cruise. While vacation-
ing in the Mediterranean, she had a stroke and died
intestate. Daisy's only surviving heir was her
daughter, Dottie. Unknown to Daisy, the envelope
containing the deed and note was returned to her
Portsmith home by the post office and stamped,
"Addressee Deceased."

Question 39 is based on the following fact situation.

Although Croesus, an attorney, had a lucrative
estate planning and probate practice, he was in
financial difficulties due to his compulsive gam-
bling. In order to pay off illegal gambling debts for
which default meant possible death, Croesus pre-
pared a deed so that it appeared that a client,
Osaka, was conveying Distantacre to Croesus.
Croesus then forged the signature of Osaka and the
acknowledgement of the notary, and caused the
deed to be recorded in the appropriate county

recorder's office in the State of Distant. Croesus
then offered Distantacre for sale to another client,
Midas, a young doctor who had come to Croesus
for investment advice. Midas, who knew nothing of
the forgery, agreed to purchase Distantacre for its
market value, but insisted that Croesus convey
insurable title. Midas obtained an abstract of title
and title insurance from Titleco, which had exam-
ined the relevant public records and did not detect
the forged nature of the Osaka-Croesus deed. Midas
obtained a warranty deed to Distantacre from
Croesus and promptly recorded it.

At the same time Croesus was forging his deed to
Distantacre, Osaka was trying to convince his
niece, Larsen, to remain in college rather than drop
out to pursue her singing career full-time. Osaka
executed a warranty deed conveying Distantacre to
Larsen. He showed her the deed and then placed it
in his office safe, telling Larsen, "When you gradu-
ate from college, Distantacre will be yours, to sell
to finance your singing career or for whatever other
purpose you wish."

Midas soon afterward visited the State of Distant to
attend a medical convention, and when he contacted
a local realtor to determine whether Distantacre had
appreciated in value, learned that Osaka's numerous
land holdings in the area were well known to the
business community, and that no information
regarding any sale of Distantacre had been
announced. Midas immediately brought an appro-
priate action to quiet title to Distantacre. The
recording act in the State of Distant provides that a
conveyance of real property is void as against any
subsequent purchaser in good faith and for value
whose conveyance is first recorded.

39. Assuming that all interested parties are joined

in the action, in whom should title to
Distantacre be certified?

Titleco, if it is forced to compensate
Midas by paying him an amount equal
to the purchase price of Distantacre.
Osaka, because the forged deed by
which Croesus purported to take
Distantacre is null and void.
Midas, because he is a subsequent pur-
chaser without notice who first
recorded.
Larsen, because she is a successor in
interest to Osaka.

was to close on December 20. The Riverside Resort
consisted of a six room hotel with a large patio area
facing the river. On December 1, after three weeks
of heavy rain, the river flooded, severely damaging
the resort. Selig had allowed his insurance to lapse
because of the pending sale, and Bracero had
undertaken no insurance as to the Resort. When
Bracero learned of the damage to the Resort, he
refused to proceed with the sale transaction. Selig
sought specific performance.

September 15 "or anytime before."

On August 1, the state government instituted a con-

September 1, the condemnation was finalized and
Vendor received $550,000 from the state govern-

Aparicio owned a 10-acre tract of undeveloped land
known as Okeefenokeeacre. The property was
located in southern Florida and consisted mostly of
swampland and marshes. In March, 2007, Aparicio
contracted to sell the property to Fox for the pur-
chase price of $25,000. Before the date set for clos-
ing of escrow, Fox had the property surveyed and
discovered that at least 60% of Okeefenokeeacre
was regulated by the Florida Wetlands Regulatory
Act.

According to relevant provisions of the Wetlands
statute, no structures of any kind could be con-
structed on the swampland portion of the property.
Moreover, the state regulatory act restricted devel-
opment on the adjoining non-swampland section by
prohibiting construction of any commercial struc-
tures. Before entering into the land sale contract,
Fox had orally made known to Aparicio that he
planned to construct a resort hotel on the property.
After being apprised of the situation, Fox refused to
purchase Okeefenokeeacre.

42. If Aparicio brings suit for specific perfor-

mance, judgment for whom?

(A) Fox, because there was a failure of

consideration.

(B) Fox, because Aparicio's silence consti-

tuted a constructive warranty.

Oatbran executed a written agreement with
Periodontal for the sale of Colonacre which was to
be transferred "free of all easements, covenants,
restrictions or other encumbrances." After the
signing of the contract, but before the time set for
closing, Oatbran discovered a tax lien on the
property in the amount of $15,000. Lacking the
cash to pay off the lien, Oatbran instructed the
escrow holder which the parties had selected to use
$15,000 of the purchase price to be deposited into
escrow by Periodontal to pay off the tax lien before
releasing any of the proceeds of the sale from
escrow. Oatbran also deposited into escrow a war-
ranty deed to Colonacre in favor of Periodontal.

When Periodontal learned of the existence of the
tax lien, and of Oatbran's instructions to the escrow
holder, he canceled the escrow and informed
Oatbran that he refused to proceed with the transac-
tion. Oatbran brought an immediate action for
specific performance to compel Periodontal to
deposit the $500,000 into escrow and to accept the
warranty deed.

43. Which of the following is the strongest

argument for granting specific performance
to Oatbran?

The tax lien follows the proceeds of sale
and is extinguished as to Colonacre at
the closing of escrow.
Title has already passed to Periodontal
under the doctrine of equitable conver-
sion, and the only issue is how the tax
lien is to be satisfied.
Oatbran has not violated any provision
of the contract.
In a land sale contract, the seller may
earmark a portion of the proceeds in
escrow to remove an encumbrance on
the property being conveyed.

46. Evans will most likely

(A) prevail, because Davis acquired title to

Greenacre by quitclaim deed

(B) prevail, because Evans was a third-party
beneficiary under the conveyance
between Clark and Davis

(C) not prevail, because the conveyance

between Clark and Davis did not effec-
tuate a delegation of duties

(D) not prevail, unless the land was subject

to the mortgage

47. Assume for the purposes of this question only
that Clark's quitclaim deed to Davis made no
reference to the mortgage. Clark then
defaulted on the mortgage and Evans brought
an in personam action against Davis to
recover the amount of the mortgage due. The
mortgagee will probably

(A)

(B)

succeed, because an implied delegation
of duties resulted from Clark's con-
veyance to Davis
succeed, because Evans was a third-
party beneficiary under the conveyance
between Clark and Davis

(C) not succeed, because Davis did not

promise to pay the mortgage debt
(D) not succeed, unless Davis had construc-
tive notice of the existence of the mort-
gage

Jim Ray Hart was a real estate investor in San
Jacinto. He typically purchased dilapidated buildings
in low income neighborhoods at discount prices.
After renovating these buildings, Jim Ray would sell
them at substantially higher rates and make signifi-
cant profits. In 2004, Jim Ray acquired Alcatraz
Towers, a ten-story office building located in the
Pacific Heights section of town. The building had
been seriously damaged in the 1989 earthquake and
been vacant for a number of years.

Jim Ray purchased the building from Felipe Alou for
$850,000. According to the real estate agreement,
Jim Ray paid Alou $500,000 in cash and assumed an
existing $350,000 mortgage which Magnin
Mortgage Company, the mortgagee, had recorded in
1986. To finance the purchase of Alcatraz Towers,
Jim Ray borrowed $500,000 from Nob Hill Bank. As
consideration for the loan, Jim Ray executed a pur-
chase money mortgage in favor of Nob Hill. This
mortgage was properly recorded in July, 2004.

Jim Ray proceeded to renovate the building and in
early 2005 started leasing office space in Alcatraz
Towers. Due to a real estate glut in the downtown
area, Jim Ray found it difficult to find tenants for
his building. With only a 20% occupancy rate, Jim
Ray was unable to make his mortgage payments
and in May, 2005 defaulted on both mortgages.
Nob Hill then initiated a foreclosure proceeding
against Jim Ray and Magnin Mortgage Company as
joint defendants. Magnin filed a cross-complaint
alleging that its mortgage was a first mortgage on
Alcatraz Towers and should be given priority over
Nob Hill's security interest.

This jurisdiction has the following recording statute
in effect: "An unrecorded conveyance or other
instrument is invalid as against a subsequent bona
fide purchaser (creditor or mortgagee) for value
and without notice who records first."

48. The court should enter a judgment that will

grant the relief sought by

(A) Magnin Mortgage Company, because its

mortgage was recorded earlier in time
(B) Magnin Mortgage Company, because

Jim Ray assumed the existing mortgage
at the time he purchased the property
from Alou

(C) Nob Hill Bank, unless it is charged with
record notice of Magnin's mortgage
(D) Nob Hill Bank, because a purchase

money mortgage takes priority over the
recording statute

Question 49 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 50 is based on the following fact situation.

Leonard Lemke owned River Oaks, a 40-acre tract
of farmland, located in Augusta County. During the
1990s when property values skyrocketed in
Augusta County, Lemke borrowed $50,000 from
Harlan Hargrove, an investment banker, and
secured the loan by a mortgage on River Oaks.
At the time this transaction took place in August,
1996, Lemke requested that Hargrove record the
mortgage. In July, 1999, Lemke conveyed River
Oaks to Bonnie Biddle who purchased the property
for $250,000. As part of the real estate transaction,
Biddle promised Lemke that she would be responsi-
ble for discharging the mortgage indebtedness to
Hargrove. This agreement of assumption was
contained in the deed instrument conveying title
to Biddle.

When Lemke sold the property to Biddle in 1999
Hargrove still had not recorded his mortgage on
River Oaks. In December, 2005, Biddle sold River
Oaks to Toby Tippen for $275,000. When Tippen
purchased the property, he had no notice of the
Hargrove mortgage.

49. In January, 2006, Hargrove demanded that

Lemke repay him the $50,000 mortgage debt.
When Lemke refused, Hargrove sued Lemke
to recover the outstanding indebtedness.
Judgment for whom?

Hargrove, because Lemke is primarily
liable for the mortgage debt.
Hargrove, because he has the election of
suing Lemke personally or foreclosing
on the property.
Lemke, because he is entitled to exoner-
ation and, thus, he may compel Hargrove
to enforce his claim against the property
first.
Lemke, because Hargrove did not record
the mortgage.

On March 1, 2004, Marcus purchased a large tract
of riverfront property (hereafter referred to as
Riverfront) in downtown Cincinnati for $750,000.
According to the terms of the real estate sales
agreement, Marcus was required to make a 20%
down payment of $150,000. To finance the balance
of the purchase price, Marcus borrowed $500,000
from Center City Bank with the loan being secured
by a first mortgage in Riverfront. In addition,
Marcus's father-in-law, Singer, loaned him
$100,000 which was secured by a second mortgage
on Riverfront. Both mortgages were properly exe-
cuted and duly recorded.

When Marcus purchased the property, he planned
to commercially develop Riverfront with upscale
shops and restaurants. By January, 2007, however,
his grandiose plans had gone bust and the so-called
Riverfront project turned into a financial disaster.
Marcus defaulted on both mortgages by failing to
make the required monthly payments. Center City
Bank elected to accelerate and brought an action to
foreclose, joining Marcus as defendant, but,
because of the negligence of the bank's attorney,
failed to join Singer. Thereupon, the court entered a
foreclosure judgment, ordering the sale of
Riverfront for satisfaction of the bank's claim
against Marcus. At the foreclosure sale, Center City
Bank purchased Riverfront for $427,000 which was
the amount unpaid on the first mortgage.

Thereinafter, Singer learned about the foreclosure
and the bank's purchase of Riverfront. He now
seeks legal advice from Covington, his attorney, as
to what recourse he has against Center City Bank in
order to protect his interest in Riverfront. Note:
there is no applicable statute significantly altering
the common-law right of redemption.

50. Attorney Covington should advise Singer that

he can protect his interest

(A) only by an action to redeem
(B) only by an action to foreclose
(C)

either by an action to redeem or by an
action to foreclose

(D) neither by an action to redeem nor by an

action to foreclose

1.

Billy Graham, the founder of the Fillmore West the-
atre in San Francisco, announced that he was orga-
nizing a special show commemorating the theatre's
25th anniversary. Among the rock bands hired to
perform were Jefferson Starship, Grateful Dead,
Quicksilver Messenger Service, Santana, Blodwyn
Pig, Spirit, Country Joe and the Fish and Love. The
show, which was scheduled for February 27, was
sold out many months in advance. On February 1,
Taylor, who had purchased two front row seats for
the concert, sent the following letter (which was
identical in all respects) to his three friends, James,
Kate and Livingston:

"Dear James, Kate and Livingston:

As you already know, I have two seats for the
special Fillmore West concert. Unfortunately,
I can't attend because my sister is getting
married that night. If any of you are inter-
ested in buying my tickets, I will let you have
them for a reasonable price. However, I must
have your reply by February 20.

s/Taylor"

The tickets, which cost Taylor $100, were now sell-
ing for between $500 and $700. On February 19,
Taylor received a letter from James which stated, "I
accept your offer and will pay you $500 for the two
tickets. Taylor did not immediately respond to
James' letter. On February 22, Taylor received the
following letter from Kate, "I am dying to go to the
concert...will pay $700 for your seats." The next
day, Taylor sent a telegram to Kate which read,
"The tickets are yours. You may take delivery upon
payment of the $700." Livingston did not respond
to Taylor's letter.

Suppose that James tenders $500 to Taylor
within a reasonable time but Taylor refuses to
tender the tickets to him. In an action by
James against Taylor for breach of contract,
judgment for whom?

Taylor, because his letter of February 1
and James' reply were too indefinite to
constitute an offer and acceptance.
Taylor, because Taylor's letter of
February 1 manifested on its face to the
three recipients that it was not intended
to be construed as an offer.
James, because his was the highest bid
submitted before the February 20 dead-
line.
James, because Taylor's attempt to sell
the tickets to Kate was a breach of an
implied promise to act in good faith.

2.

Suppose that Taylor tenders the tickets to Kate
within a reasonable time but Kate refuses to
pay the $700. In an action by Taylor against
Kate for breach of contract, judgment for
whom?

Taylor, because Kate's bid was higher
than James', therefore it constituted an
acceptance of Taylor's offer.
Taylor, because his telegram of February
23 operated as an acceptance of Kate's
offer.
Kate, because she did not accept Taylor's
offer within the specified time period.
Kate, because although Taylor's letter of
February 1 may have constituted an
offer, Kate never accepted by the act of
tendering the $700.

Question 4 is based on the following fact situation.

Higgins, a wealthy lawyer, lived in an exquisite
home located in the fashionable neighborhood of
Bel Air. Higgins had known Otto, a gardener, for
many years. One day, Otto was walking down the
street when he ran into Higgins. Otto said to
Higgins, "I will landscape your garden for $200."
Higgins replied, "That seems like a good deal."
Thereupon, Swenson, who was Higgins' brother-in-
law walked by. The three individuals then started
conversing about the fate of John Walker, the
American Taliban. Nothing further was said about
the landscaping of Higgins' garden.

The next day, Higgins telephoned Otto and said, "I
accept your offer." Otto replied, "I can't landscape
your garden because last night I contracted to land-
scape Darwin's property." Darwin and Higgins were
neighbors.

3.	

If Higgins sues Otto for breach of contract,
who will likely prevail?

Otto, because the offer lapsed at the end
of their conversation.
Otto, because his contract with Darwin
effectuated a revocation of his offer to
Higgins.
Higgins, because the acceptance was
communicated before the attempted
revocation.
Higgins, because the revocation was
ineffective.

On Monday, Chad, a widget wholesaler, faxed
Barney a letter promising to sell him 500 widgets
for $2,000. On Tuesday, Barney telephoned Chad
and said he was rejecting the offer because the
price was too high. During the telephone conversa-
tion, Chad responded, "Why don't you wait and
think it over until tomorrow?" The following day,
Barney learned that there was a nationwide widget
shortage. He immediately telephoned Chad and
said, "I changed my mind and will accept your
offer." Chad then told Barney, "Sorry, pal, you had
your chance and blew it."

4.	

After Chad refused to sell the widgets to him,
Barney sued for breach of contract. Is there an
enforceable contract between the parties?

(A) No, because Barney's telephone call on
Tuesday constituted a rejection.
(B) No, because there was no consideration
to keep the offer open until Wednesday.

(C) Yes, because Chad's statement "Why

don't you think it over until tomorrow"
revived the offer which Barney subse-
quently accepted in a timely fashion.
(D) Yes, if and only if Chad and Barney are

drinking fountains, mailed to Sparkletts, a drinking
fountain retailer, the following written offer, "Will
sell 100 water bubblers (drinking fountains) at our
list price of $50 each. Available for immediate
delivery. Please respond by return mail."

Unaware of Stolper's offer, Sparkletts on August 1
(the same day) mailed a written letter to Stolper
containing the identical same terms: "Will purchase
100 water bubblers (drinking fountains) at your list
price of $50 each." Both letters were mailed
through the U.S. postal system.

7.	

Before either party has received the other's
correspondence, which of the following accu-
rately states the legal relationship between
Stolper and Sparkletts?

Since there was obviously a "meeting of
the minds", a contract was formed when
Sparkletts mailed its letter.
A contract exists with U.C.C. gap filler
provisions controlling for delivery and
payment terms.
A contract was formed when Sparkletts
deposited its "acceptance" since the
cross communications contained identi-
cal terms.
No contract exists because the parties
lack mutuality of assent.

Tex was a well known rodeo performer who lived in
Ft. Worth. One day Barnum approached Tex and

8.	

If Tex thereafter goes ahead and rides the
bronco for one minute, will he recover the
$500?

(A) No, because Barnum's revocation was
effective since Tex had not completed
performance.

(B) Yes, because there was an offer for a

unilateral contract that became irrevoca-
ble prior to Barnum's attempted
revocation.

(C) Yes, under the doctrine of estoppel in

(D) Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-con-

Assume the following facts for this question
only. Tex mounted the bronco and was riding
it for thirty seconds when Barnum yelled,
"The deal's off...I hereby revoke my offer." At
this juncture, which of the following best
states the legal rights and duties of the respec-
tive parties?

,(-Al Tex can dismount the bronco immedi-
ately and still recover the $500.
(B) Tex can continue riding the bronco for

the full one minute and recover damages
for breach of contract.

(C) Regardless of what Tex does, Barnum is
liable to pay him only for the cost of the
saddle which Tex purchased in reliance
on Barnum's offer.

.(D)- Regardless of what Tex does, Barnum is

not liable to pay Tex anything because
the revocation effectively discharges

Donner, an avid stamp collector for over twenty
years, had amassed a large and valuable collection.
Many of his stamps were extremely rare and highly
coveted. On numerous occasions Donner had
rejected offers to sell his prized collection. Finally,
on May 1 Donner sent Martin, his cousin who was
also a fellow stamp collector, the following letter:

"I've decided to part with my stamp collec-
tion. Since I want to keep it in the family, I'll
sell you my entire collection for $75,000. You
have until May 15 to make up your mind."

Donner had dictated this letter to his secretary who
mistakenly typed $75,000 instead of $78,000 that
Donner had specified. After typing the letter, the
secretary gave it to Donner who hastily signed it
without noticing the mistaken price. Martin
received this letter on May 3. Without notifying
Martin, Donner went ahead and sold his stamp col-
lection to Bigalow for $80,000 on May 10. The next
day, Donner sent a letter to Martin regretfully
informing him that he had sold the collection. This
letter was received by Martin on May 13. However,
on May 12 Martin read a local newspaper article
concerning Donner's sale of his unique stamp col-
lection to Bigalow. After reading the article, Martin
immediately dispatched a telegram to Donner
accepting his offer to buy the stamp collection. This
telegram was received by Donner that same after-
noon (i.e., May 12).

10. In all likelihood was Martin's telegram to
Donner on May 12 effective as an accep-
tance?

Yes, because Donner's May 11 letter did
not effectuate a revocation since it was
not received by Martin until May 13.
Yes, because consideration is not neces-
sary under the Uniform Commercial
Code for the creation of a sale-of-goods
contract.
No, because Donner's sale of the stamp
collection to Bigalow on May 10 termi-
nated Martin's power of acceptance.
No, because Martin's reading the news-
paper article on May 12 terminated
Martin's power of acceptance.

LeRoy King, a high school senior at Seton Hall
Prep, had been accepted at Rutgers and Princeton.
The tuition at Rutgers was $5,000 per year. LeRoy
had planned on going to Rutgers until he discussed
his choice of colleges with his wealthy uncle,
Reggie Reed. Reggie, an alumnus of Princeton, had
fond memories of his Ivy League alma mater and
strongly encouraged LeRoy to attend Princeton.

Thereupon, Reggie promised LeRoy that he would
pay the $25,000 tuition at Princeton for the first
year if Reggie went there instead of Rutgers. LeRoy
accepted Reggie's offer and notified Princeton that
he would be attending college in the fall. LeRoy
also informed Rutgers that he would not be attend-

from Princeton informing him that the $25,000
tuition fee was presently due. LeRoy contacted the

Ohner owned a large three-story office building in
downtown Metropolis. She planned to renovate the
building and requested several contractors to submit
bids to perform the work. One of the contractors,
Builder, in turn sought bids from several subcon-

Electrician submitted a bid to Builder that he used
in computing the bid he sent to Ohner. Builder noti-
fied Electrician to the effect.

On November 1, Builder submitted his bid to Ohner
in which he offered to perform the renovation work
for $75,000. On November 4, Electrician notified
Builder that he was unable to perform the electrical
work on Ohner's project. On November 5, Ohner
sent Builder a signed confirmation letter wherein
she stated, "I hereby accept your offer to perform
the renovation work for the quoted cost of
$75,000." Thereafter, Builder hired another electri-
cian to complete the electrical work at a cost of
$5,000 above Electrician's bid. Builder explained
the situation to Ohner and informed her that the
overall cost of the job would have to be increased to
$80,000. Ohner responded that she would hold
Builder to his original bid of $75,000 and would
not be responsible for any additional costs. Builder
then performed the renovation work, but Ohner has
not yet paid him anything.

13. Which of the following best supports a claim
for $5,000 by Builder against Electrician?

Electrician made an offer that Builder
accepted by using Electrician's bid in
computing the bid he submitted to
Ohner.
Electrician's bid was a "firm offer" that
was not revocable since both Electrician
and Builder were merchants.
Builder made an offer to Electrician that
Electrician accepted when he submitted

Question 14 is based on the following fact situation.

Luther LeGrand owned Chateau Chautauqua (here-
after referred to as Chautauqua), a 150-acre tract of
farmland, located outside of Wichita Falls. On April
1, Luther signed a written instrument which con-
tained the following provision: "In consideration of
$50, receipt of which is acknowledged, LeGrand
hereby grants Corina Cox a twenty-day option to
purchase Chateau Chautauqua for $250,000." The
property had recently been appraised for $250,000.
The next day Cox secured bank financing to pur-
chase the property.

On April 7, Solomon Stone, a real estate investor,
approached LeGrand and offered to buy
Chautauqua for $295,000. As a result, LeGrand
sent Cox a letter revoking the option. The revoca-
tion letter was received and read by Cox on April 9.
The next day, Cox mailed LeGrand a letter stating:
"I hereby exercise my option to purchase
Chautauqua and am ready, willing and able to con-
summate the sale on whichever date you instruct."

When LeGrand received this letter on April 11, he
telephoned Cox and told her he had revoked the
option and decided not to sell her the property. Cox
has now filed suit against LeGrand seeking specific
performance of the option and sale of Chautauqua.
In defense, LeGrand has presented uncontroverted
evidence documenting that Cox never paid him any
part of the $50 consideration recited in the option
agreement executed on April 1st.

14. Assume for the purposes of this question that
Cox, in fact, did not pay the $50 consideration
to LeGrand. Which of the following is the
STRONGEST argument in support of Cox's
suit for specific performance?

eGrand has committed an uncured

material breach of an implied promise to
cooperate in refusing to honor the option
and subsequent sale of the property to
Cox.
Acknowledging receipt of nominal con-
sideration in a written instrument, even
if false, is sufficient to make the option
irrevocable for the stipulated period
where the transaction proposes a fair
exchange.
Under the doctrine of promissory estop-
pel, Cox has relied on the written agree-
ment in exercising her option and is
ready, willing and able to consummate
the land sale transaction.
Since the writing appears to be a com-
plete integration, evidence for the pur-
pose of showing a lack of consideration
is inadmissible under the parol evidence
rule.

Question 16 is based on the following fact situation.

Cleetco Corporation is the nation's leading cleetch
manufacturer. A cleetch is a custom designed trans-
mitter device that is used in wireless phones. Sprint
has entered into a written contract with Cleetco to
purchase 1,000 cleetches for the total contract price
of $100,000 (or $100 a piece).

After the 1,000 cleetches were manufactured,
Springer, Sprint's president, received a telephone
call from Clutz, Cleetco's CEO. During their con-
versation, Clutz told Springer that Cleetco would
not deliver the cleetches unless Sprint agreed to pay
an additional $5 per cleetch.

Reluctantly, Springer agreed to pay the additional
$5 per cleetch. Following their phone conversation,
Clutz authorized the delivery of the 1,000 cleetches
to Sprint. After the transmitter devices were
accepted by Sprint, Springer sent Cleetco a check
in the amount of $100,000. Clutz has made
repeated demands for the additional $5,000 which
Springer refuses to pay.

15. Cleetco filed suit against Sprint to recover the
additional $5,000. Which of the following
would provide Sprint with its best argument
why it is not obligated to pay the $5,000?

(A) There was no new consideration for

Springer's promise to pay the additional
$5,000.

(B) Clutz acted in bad faith in demanding

the additional $5,000.

(C) Springer's oral promise was unenforce-
able as violative of the statute of frauds.

(D) The price modification materially

altered the terms of the contract and,
thus, did not become part of the bargain.

Molar, a periodontist, owned a two-story office
building in a decaying section of downtown
Cleveland. She occupied the first floor which was

the terms of which Night Owl agreed to clean both
offices during a one-year period for a weekly fee of
$400. The contract also provided that Night Owl
would perform the cleaning on Wednesday night
each week after the offices had closed for business.

Night Owl performed its office cleaning services
on each Wednesday for the first two months of the
contract. Thereafter, on May 1, Molar telephoned
Night Owl and said, "We're having an office party
on Friday night. I'll pay you an additional $500 if
you can perform your cleaning service next week
on Sunday instead of the usual Wednesday." Night
Owl orally agreed.

16. Assume for the purposes of this question only
that Night Owl performed the office cleaning
as promised on Sunday instead of Wednesday.
Afterwards, Molar paid Night Owl $400 for its
weekly cleaning services and did not include
the extra $500. If Night Owl brings a breach of
contract action against Molar to recover the
additional fee of $500, judgment for whom?

(A) Night Owl will win if the court deter-

mines that both parties were merchants;
and therefore free under applicable law
to effectively modify their original con-
tract without any new consideration for
Molar's promise to pay the additional
$500.

(B) Night Owl will win because the parties'
telephone conversation on May 1,
regarding Night Owl's performing clean-
ing services on Sunday, was an effective
modification of the original contract.
(C) Molar will win because an oral agree-

ment for compensation of $500 or more
is unenforceable under the applicable
Statute of Frauds.

(D) Molar will win because Night Owl was
under a pre-existing duty to perform the
cleaning services on Wednesday of that
week; thus Molar's promise to pay extra
compensation was unenforceable for
lack of legal consideration.

Question 17 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 18 is based on the following fact situation.

Daisy DuPont was a descendant of Pierre DuPont,
the founder of the DuPont Chemical Company.
Daisy, who was very wealthy, owned an extensive
art collection which she displayed at Montepellier,
her country mansion. While Daisy was away on a
Mediterranean cruise, there was a burglary at
Montepellier and her favorite Picasso painting enti-
tled "Margaux" was stolen. Although the painting
was insured for $1,000,000 by Floyd's of Flounder
Insurance Company, it had a market value of over
$1,500,000.

When Daisy returned from her trip, she met with
Jayson Jewell, a detective employed by Floyd's of
Flounder, to investigate the theft. During their
meeting, Daisy told Jayson that she would pay him
an extra $50,000 if he recovered the painting. For
the next three weeks Jayson investigated the theft as
part of his job responsibilities with Floyd's. Within
the course of this investigation, Jayson learned who
was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence,
the culprit was apprehended and the Picasso paint-
ing was recovered and returned to Daisy.

17. Jayson then requested the $50,000 which

Daisy had promised to pay him. After Daisy
refused to make the payment, Jayson sued
Daisy for breach of contract. Judgment for

(A) Daisy, because her promise was gratu-

itous

(B) Daisy, because the insurance company

owed her a pre-existing duty to find the
painting

(C) Daisy, because as an intended third-

(D)

party beneficiary under Floyd's employ-
ment agreement with Jayson, she did not
incur any legal detriment
Jayson, because the market value of the
painting exceeded its insured value,
there was sufficient consideration to
support Daisy's promise

Player, an experienced antique collector, orally
agreed to pay Stringer $250,000 for a rare
Stradivarius violin. During their negotiations, both
parties referred to the violin as "an original
Stradivarius". Stringer, a reputable antique dealer,
made no positive representations to that effect,
however, and player relied on his own judgment in
the matter. Accordingly, Player paid Stringer
$250,000 and received the violin. At the time of the
purchase, Stringer also handed Player a "bill of
sale" disclaiming, under applicable provisions of
the Uniform Commercial Code, all express or
implied warranties. The "bill of sale" was signed by
Stringer but not by Player.

A short time later, Player discovered that the violin
that he purchased was not an original Stradivarius
but a masterful imitation. The violin was valued at
only $500.

18. Player nows brings an appropriate action

against Stringer to rescind the contract and
recover the $250,000. Which of the following
will the court probably decide?

(A) Stringer will win, because the sales con-

tract was valid and enforceable under
the doctrine of caveat emptor.

(B) Stringer will win, because the "bill of

sale" disclaimed any warranties as to the
genuineness of the violin.

(C) Player will win, because although the

sales contract was valid, it would be
unenforceable under the Statute of
Frauds since Player did not sign the "bill
of sale".

(D) Player will win, because although the

sales contract was valid, it would be
voidable by Player since the parties were
mutually mistaken about the genuine-
ness of the violin.

Question 19 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 20 is based on the following fact situation.

Symington Spendthrift, an immensely wealthy D.C.
attorney, gives an annual Christmas party to which
the most prominent persons in Washington society
are invited. Invitations are coveted, and the party is
a trademark of Spendthrift's social presence in the
nation's capitol. For this year's Christmas party,
Spendthrift has decided to engage Rudolph Ruski, a
world famous ballet performer, to entertain his
guests. Spendthrift and Ruski are old acquain-
tances. They have known each other since 1968
when Ruski, who was a famous dancer with the
Bolshoi ballet, left the troupe and received political
asylum in the United States. Subsequently, they
have met at various parties and other social gather-
ings in the Washington area. Last year Spendthrift
even provided legal representation for Ruski when
he applied for permanent United States citizenship
status.

Hoping that Ruski did not have any prior engage-
ments, Spendthrift approached Ruski and asked if
he would be willing to perform at his Christmas
party. After Rush agreed, the parties then entered
into the following written contract:

"In consideration of Spendthrift's prior legal ser-
vices in preparing Ruski's U.S. citizenship papers
last year, for which, in exchange, Rush agreed to
pay Spendthrift a 'standard retainer,' Ruski hereby
promises to give a ballet performance at
Spendthrift's Christmas party, and waive his usual
$10,000 entertainment charge. Spendthrift hereby
relinquishes his claim against Ruski for the unpaid
retainer fee."

Thereafter, Ruski informed Spendthrift that he had
changed his mind and decided to spend the
Christmas holiday visiting his motherland. As a
result, he couldn't perform at Spendthrift's party.
Spendthrift was highly embarrassed because he had
already told his friends about Ruski's appearance.
Spendthrift then hired Romanoff, another ballet
star, to perform at his Christmas party for a $7,500
fee.

Adam Payne & Sons, a painting company, was
established in 1956. The company was owned and
operated by Adam Payne, age 56, who inherited the
business from his father. Adam had three sons,
Aaron, Buster and Clem. All the brothers worked
under their father's employ in the family painting
business. In 1988, Aaron, Buster and Clem had a
bitter argument with their father and decided to
start their own painting company, which they
named Aaron Payne & Brothers.

Thereafter, Aaron Payne in his new firm name
entered into a contract with Benjamin Moore
Paints, a large wholesale paint dealer, to purchase
50 gallons of paint in assorted colors, at $12 per
gallon. According to contract terms, delivery was
set for March 1 with full payment ($600) due thirty
days later. Before shipment, Betty Morgan,
Benjamin Moore's sales representative who negoti-
ated the sale, suddenly realized that she had been
dealing with Aaron Payne & Brothers rather than
Adam Payne & Sons, a longtime customer. Betty
telephoned Aaron, explained the mistake, and indi-
cated that her company required C.O.D. payment
instead of thirty day billing since this was a new
account. Being short of cash, Aaron Payne covered
by buying 50 gallons of paint from another dealer
on credit at a higher price.

19. Aaron Payne & Brothers now sues Benjamin
Moore to recover damages for breach of con-
tract. Which of the following facts, if true,
would most strengthen Benjamin Moore's
defense that because of misunderstanding no
contract was formed?

During her negotiations to sell the paint
to Aaron Payne & Brothers, Betty
Morgan referred to "your long estab-
lished business".
Whether Aaron Payne & Brothers would
have performed or breached the contract
would make very little difference in
Benjamin Moore's overall business oper-
ations.
During his negotiations with Betty
Morgan, Aaron Payne believed that she
recognized that he was acting on behalf
of his new firm.
Aaron Payne & Brothers is on the verge
of insolvency.

Question 21 is based on the following fact situation.

In a written contract Singer agreed to deliver to
Byer 500 described chairs at $20 each F.O.B.
Singer's place of business. The contract provided
that "neither party will assign this contract without
the written consent of the other." Singer placed the
chairs on board a carrier on January 30. On
February 1 Singer said in a signed writing, "I
hereby assign to Wheeler all my rights under the
Singer-Byer contract." Singer did not request and
did not get Byer's consent to this transaction. On
February 2 the chairs while in transit were destroyed in a
derailment of the carrier's railroad car.

21. In an action by Wheeler against Byer,
Wheeler probably will recover

(A) $10,000, the contract price
(B)

the difference between the contract price
and the market value of the chairs
(C) nothing, because the chairs had not been

delivered

(D) nothing, because the Singer-Byer con-

tract forbade an assignment

20. Assume for the purposes of this question only

the following facts. Rather than suing Ruski,
Spendthrift approached Romanoff and said,
"As you already know I have a cause of action
against Ruski for nonperformance. I hereby
transfer and assign to you that claim, up to
$7,500, provided that you try to collect it
from him and agree to apply anything you do
collect, less expenses of collection, to your
fee for performing at my party." Romanoff
replied, "It's a deal." One week later,
Spendthrift sent Romanoff a letter revoking
this oral assignment. Which of the following
accurately states Romanoff's legal position
with regard to his rights under the assignment
from Spendthrift?

(A) Romanoff acquired no rights under the
assignment from Spendthrift because it
was not an unconditional transfer.
(B) Romanoff acquired no rights under the
assignment from Spendthrift because it
was oral and, therefore, unenforceable
under the Statute of Frauds.

(C) Romanoff acquired a right against Ruski

under the assignment from Spendthrift
but subsequently lost that right because
the assignment was gratuitous and,
therefore, revocable by Spendthrift.
(D) Romanoff acquired by irrevocable

assignment for value a right to enforce
against Ruski the contract rights, if any,
that Spendthrift had against Ruski, up to
$7,500, at the time of the assignment.

Question 22 is based on the following fact situation.

For many years, Insurance Business Machines (here-
after referred to as I.B.M.) was engaged in the man-
ufacture and sale of specialized office equipment to
insurance companies in the northeast sector of the
United States. On May 1st, under a signed and writ-
ten contract, I.B.M. sold a computer system to the
Prudential Insurance Company in Hartford,
Connecticut for $120,000. The contract, which was
silent as to possible assignment by either party,
obligated I.B.M. to install and program a computer
system designed to Prudential's own specifications.
Under the terms of the agreement, Prudential
promised to pay I.B.M. the purchase price in three
annual installments of $40,000, beginning on June
1st. The contract further stipulated that I.B.M. would
install a list processing software program immedi-
ately, and then install without additional cost, no
later than December 1st, a telecommunications sup-
port system compatible with Prudential's West Coast
offices. The contract recited that the telecommuni-
cations system would be an essential and indispens-
able part of I.B.M.'s total performance.

As contracted, I.B.M. installed the computer equip-
ment at Prudential's Hartford offices. In addition,
I.B.M. service technicians programmed the list pro-
cessing software system in accordance with
Prudential's own specifications.

On August 1st, however, I.B.M. sold its computer
hardware division to Klewel Corp., a multinational
publishing company based in Denmark. As part of
the I.B.M.-Klewel transaction, the parties included
the following written clause in their agreement:

"I.B.M. hereby assigns to Klewel the right to
receive the outstanding annual payments in
the amount of $80,000 which Prudential
owes I.B.M under the terms of the 1.B.M.-
Prudential contract entered into on May 1st
of this year."

On September 1st, I.B.M. sold all of its other busi-
ness assets to Telecomp for a gross sales price of
$1,000,000. Telecomp, a Palo Alto computer com-
pany operating in all fifty states, specialized in the
development and sale of data processing equip-
ment. Although Telecomp manufactured software
systems that were compatible with I.B.M.'s comput-
ers, Telecomp had no previous experience with
either I.B.M.'s list processing software or telecom-
munications system. As part of Telecomp's acquisi-
tion agreement with I.B.M., Telecomp promised, in
exchange for a discount of $20,000 from the

$1,000,000 gross sales price, to install and ser-
vice the telecommunications support system as
required by the I.B.M.-Prudential contract. The
I.B.M.-Telecomp agreement, however, stipulated
that I.B.M. had assigned all of its rights to pay-
ment from Prudential to Klewel.

22. Assume the following facts for this ques-

tion only. On October 1st, Prudential deliv-
ered the telecommunications support
system specifications to Telecomp. On
October 15th, Telecomp without legal
excuse notified Prudential that it would not
perform the programming or installation of
the telecommunications system. On
November 1st, Prudential informed I.B.M.
of Telecomp's refusal to perform and
requested that I.B.M. install the telecom-
munications system. I.B.M. indicated that
it was "winding up" business and also
refused to perform. On November 15th,
Prudential rescinded its contract with
I.B.M. and tendered back to Telecomp the
computer system it had received from
I.B.M. If Klewel subsequently brings suit
against I.B.M. to recover damages antici-
pated as a result of Telecomp's wrongful
refusal to install the telecommunications
system, which of the following correctly
states and justifies the probable outcome
of the case?
(A)

I.B.M. will win because it delegated
its duties to Telecomp, and thus
Telecomp was primarily responsible
for the installation of the telecommu-
nications system.
I.B.M. will win because, in assigning
its right to payments under the May
1st contract with Prudential, I.B.M.
made no reference in the written
assignment to its remaining duties, if
any, under that contract.

(B)

(C) Klewel will win because I.B.M., in

assigning its right to payments under
the May 1st contract with Prudential,
impliedly warranted as a surety the
collectibility by Klewel of the
amounts due under that contract.

(D) Klewel will win because I.B.M., in

assigning its right to payments under
the May 1st contract, impliedly war-
ranted to Klewel that Telecomp
would perform whatever acts were
required by the contract to preserve
the value of the rights assigned.

to pay Sidney $1,000 for ten lessons which were to
be held on Saturday mornings. from 10:00 am to
11:00 am. When Drake and Deke arrived for the
first lesson, they were accompanied by Drake's 6
year-old younger brother, Desmond. As Sidney
started his instructional lesson with Drake,
Desmond asked if he could participate. Sidney did
not object and allowed Desmond to receive instruc-
tions along with his brother.

As it turned out, Desmond accompanied Drake and
took all ten lessons with his older brother. Each
Saturday Deke was present and watched Sidney
give the same lessons to both boys. After Desmond
and Drake received their last lesson, Sidney
requested payment. When Deke presented a check
for $1,000, Sidney told Deke that he owed an addi-

received. After Deke refused to pay for Desmond's
lessons, Sidney brought a contract action against

Georgia and Dominic Ramsitovich were married on
June 1, 1980. Shortly thereafter, they each wrote
holographic wills which were deposited in a safe
deposit box. This jurisdiction recognizes such hand-
written wills as valid. On June 1, 1982, Georgia
and Dominic adopted Rosey, a two-year-old girl.
Since their holographic wills didn't make any pro-
vision for Rosey, Georgia and Dominic decided to
execute new wills. After destroying their holo-
graphic wills, they went to Brock, an attorney, who
duly executed new wills which were properly attes-
tated and subscribed.

The pertinent provisions of Dominic's will read as
follows: "I hereby leave my entire estate to my
beloved wife, Georgia, if she should survive me. In
the event that she does not survive me, then I leave
my entire estate to Rosey, our only child."
Dominic's will designated his brother, Carroll, as
the executor. Similarly, Georgia's will provided: "I
hereby leave my entire estate to my beloved hus-
band, Dominic, if he should survive me. In the
event that he does not survive me, then I leave my
entire estate to Rosey, our only child." At the time
their wills were executed, Georgia and Dominic
also signed a written agreement in which they each
promised not to make any testamentary changes
before or after the death of the other.

In 2000 when Rosey reached the age of twenty,
Georgia and Dominic told her about the provisions
contained in their wills. Expressing sincere grati-
tude, Rosey acknowledged her assent. On May 1,
2002, Dominic drowned while swimming off the
Florida coast. On May 20, 2002, Georgia executed
a new will leaving her estate to Barkowski, her new
boyfriend.

24. What remedial rights, if any, does Carroll, the
executor of Dominic's estate, have against
Georgia after learning of the provisions of her
new will?

(A) None.
(B) An action for nominal damages only.
(C) An action only for the value of the estate

Georgia left to Dominic.

(D) An action for specific performance of

the Georgia-Dominic contract.

Norma Nameth was an 80-year-old widow who
was confined to a wheelchair after undergoing a
hip replacement operation. Norma lived in West
Grove, a remote rural town ninety miles west of
Philadelphia. Since Norma was unable to walk,
her son, Nellie decided to hire a home health
care worker to cook and look after his mother.
Thereupon, Nellie entered into an oral agreement
with Goldie Goodfellow, a certified health care
worker, to serve as a live-in companion for his
ailing mother.

According to their agreement, Goldie would pro-
vide live-in care for Norma six days a week from
Monday through Saturday with Sunday designated
as her day off.

The parties further agreed that Nellie would pay
Goldie $600 per week and that Goldie would serve
as a health care worker for a ten month period.

Goldie started to care for Norma on February 1 and
worked continuously until July 1 when she gave
notice that she would be quitting. Thereafter, Nellie
learned that Goldie had been hired away by Inca
Inkster, Norma's invalid neighbor, who agreed to
pay Goldie $800 per week to care for her.

Nellie then attempted to hire another home health
care worker to care for Norma. He had trouble

Crooner was an opera singer who collected rare
recordings of opera stars from the 1920's. Collette
owned a collection of many old opera recordings
that she had inherited from her grandfather. Collette
learned of Crooner's interest in rare opera record-
ings and offered to sell Crooner an opera recording
from an obscure tenor, Ralphio, who died after only
one recorded performance. Crooner was anxious to
obtain the recording because there were no other
known copies of a Ralphio recorded performance
and it would make Crooner's collection complete.
Crooner offered Collette $10,000 for the Ralphio
recording, subject to certification by Prof. Erickson,
a recognized expert in the subject of 20th century
opera singers. Collette wrote to Crooner and
accepted the offer. Prior to submitting the recording
to Prof. Erickson for certification, Collette received
an offer of $20,000 from another collector for the
Ralphio recording. Collette told Prof. Erickson that
the Ralphio recording was a fake so she could take
advantage of the offer from the collector. Prof.
Erickson refused to issue the certificate and Crooner
rejected Collette's tender of the recording when she
presented it without the certificate.

26. If Crooner discovers the reason why Prof.

Erickson would not certify the recording and
brings suit against Collette, Crooner may

Questions 29-30 are based on the following fact situation.

Meredith Merryweather, a 16 year-old high school
junior, had just received her driver's permit. One
evening she was driving her mother's car in the
Orangewood National Forest when suddenly there
was a blizzard. The roadway became treacherous
and the car got stuck in an embankment.

Stranded in the forest, Meredith began walking in
the hope of being rescued by another motorist.
Miraculously, Meredith came upon a motel which
appeared to be open for business. She entered the
lobby and told Elroy Elwood, the owner, about her
predicament. Realizing that Meredith had no place
else to stay, Elwood told her that he had a vacancy
available and the room charge would be $100 per
night (despite the fact that the standard room
charge at the motel was $50 per night). Meredith
stayed two nights in the motel. The age of majority
in this jurisdiction is 18.

28. How much are Meredith's parents liable to
pay Elwood for their daughter's two night
stay?

(A) Nothing, because parents are not liable

for necessaries furnished to a minor.
(B) Nothing, because contracts of minors

are voidable.
$100, which is the reasonable rate of
furnishing necessaries to a minor.

Dee Sario had failed the California bar exam three
times. On her fourth try, she hired a tutor, Cheri
Carney, to help prepare her for the next exam. The

promised to pay Cheri $5,000 for her services. At
the time the women entered into their agreement,
Dee orally promised to pay Cheri an additional
$1,000 if she was successful on the bar exam.

Cheri performed her tutorial services and Dee suc-
cessfully passed the bar exam. When Cheri learned
that Dee had passed, she contacted her and asked
when she could expect payment (since Dee still had
not paid for the tutorial services). Dee refused to
make any payment to Cheri. Dee told Cheri that she
passed on her own merits and did not find Cheri's
instruction to be very helpful.

29. If Cheri initiates a breach of contract action

against Dee, the plaintiff should be entitled to
a judgment in the amount of

(A) $5,000, because the additional $1,000
constituted an unenforceable bonus
$5,000, because the agreement to pay
the additional $1,000 was unenforceable
under the statute of frauds

and Vault's loan officer agreed orally that Vault
would make the loan on the following terms:
(1) the loan would be repaid in full on or before
the following July 1 and would carry interest at an
annual rate of 15 percent (a lawful rate under the
applicable usury law); and (2) Gritz would person-
ally guarantee repayment. The loan was approved
and made on April 5. The only document evidenc-
ing the loan was a memorandum, written and sup-
plied by Vault and signed by Gritz for Kernel, that
read in its entirety:

"April 5

In consideration of a loan advanced on this
date, Kernel Corporation hereby promises to
pay Vault Finance, Inc., $100,000 on

Kernel Corporation did not repay the loan on or
before July 1, although it had sufficient funds to do
so. On July 10, Vault sued Kernel as principal
debtor and Gritz individually as guarantor for
$100,000, plus 15 percent interest from April 5.

31. At the trial, can Vault prove Kernel's oral

commitment to repay the loan on or before
July 1?

Yes, because the oral agreement was
supported by an independent considera-
tion.
Yes, because evidence of the parties'

Larry Lipshitz is the father of Leroy Lipshitz, presi-

Aeronautics, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Electro).
In January, 2007, the company decided to modern-
ize its manufacturing equipment and borrowed
$500,000 from the Bank of America (hereafter
referred to as BOA) for this purpose. The loan was

Electro was short of ready cash and BOA threat-
ened to foreclose. Larry Lipshitz, who owned 25%
of Electro's stock, then intervened on behalf of the
company and told BOA officials that if they would
refrain from any legal action against Electro for a
year, he would personally "stand as surety and
guarantee" the loan. The bank orally agreed to
Larry's surety arrangement.

The next day, however, Larry decided that due to
adverse conditions in the electronics industry,
Electro was, at best, a marginal credit risk.
Believing that his suretyship commitment had been
imprudent, Larry contacted BOA and repudiated
his agreement.

33. Thereafter, Electro became insolvent and

defaulted on the $500,000 loan and BOA sued
Larry Lipshitz as Electro's surety. Which of
the following will the court probably decide?

(A) Larry will win, provided that BOA's

security interest in the plant and build-
ing site is not impaired by Electro's
insolvency.

(B) Larry will win, because enforcement of
his oral promise to BOA is barred under
the suretyship clause of the Statute of
Frauds.

(C) BOA will win, if the court finds that

Larry's main purpose, actual or appar-
ent, in making his suretyship promise
was to further his own economic advan-
tage rather than to benefit Electro.
(D) BOA will win, because under the doc-

trine of promissory estoppel BOA relied
on Larry's suretyship promise.

Zelda Zellman went to Dr. Dreck, a dermatologist,
for treatment of an abnormal growth on the back of
her right shoulder. Under a written contract, Dr.
Dreck agreed to surgically remove the growth for
$750. As Zelda subsequently recalled, the parties
orally agreed that if any additional medical proce-
dures were required during surgery, they would be
included in the $750 fee. Dr. Dreck, however, has
no recollection of any such oral agreement.

As agreed, the surgery was performed on an out-
patient basis at Dr. Dreck's office. He applied a
localized anesthesia that enabled Zelda to remain
conscious during surgery. While the operation was
being performed, Dr. Dreck noticed a brown mole
on Zelda's back. As Dr. Dreck subsequently
recalled, he informed Zelda about the mole and
asked whether she wanted it removed as well.
According to Dr. Dreck's account, Zelda orally
agreed to have the mole removed for an additional
$150. Zelda has no recollection of any such oral
agreement.

Dr. Dreck performed both removal procedures sat-
isfactorily. Following the surgery, Zelda paid Dr.
Dreck $750 but refused to pay any additional
money for the mole removal. After unsuccessfully
attempting to collect the $150, Dr. Dreck brought
suit against Zelda to recover the additional fee. At
trial, Dr. Dreck objects to the introduction of testi-
mony regarding any oral agreement made before
the written contract was signed. By the same token,
Zelda objects to the introduction of testimony con-
cerning any oral agreement made during surgery.

34. Which of the following considerations is most
important to a judicial ruling on Zelda's
objection?

(A) Dr. Dreck's removal of the mole con-
ferred a clear benefit on Zelda.

(B) The proffered oral agreement regarding

payment of the additional $150 occurred
after the written agreement had been
signed.

(C) The written agreement was for services

rather than the sale of goods.

(D) The proffered oral agreement regarding
payment of the additional $150 con-
cerned a new medical procedure that
was unrelated to the subject matter of
the prior written contract.

CONTRACTS

Question 35 is based on the following fact situation.

Questions 36-37 are based on the following fact situation.

Toshi is the owner of Hama, a sushi restaurant in
Venice. Toshi contracted in writing with Fishco, a
fish distributor, to buy 50 pounds of touro (which is
a yellow fin tuna). At the time the contract was
signed, Toshi orally said to Fishco, "We do have an
understanding that Kifune, our chef, must approve
the quality of the fish before I will pay you".
Fishco acknowledged Toshi's request and
responded, "If you say so."

Thereafter, Fishco delivered the yellow fin tuna to
Toshi. After inspecting the fish, Kifune refused to
give his approval because the touro was spotted
instead of its customary shiny skin. As a result,
Toshi refused to accept and pay for the fish.

35. Fishco brought a breach of contract action
against Toshi because he refused to pay for
the fish delivery. How should the court rule
on Toshi's offer to prove, over Fishco's objec-
tion, that Kifune refused to approve the touro
that was delivered?

(A) The evidence is admissible to show frus-

tration of purpose.

(B) The evidence is admissible to show that
the written agreement was subject to an
oral condition precedent.

(C) The evidence is barred because the writ-
ten contract appears to be a complete
and total integration of the parties'
agreement.

(D) The evidence is barred because the oral

agreement is within the statute of frauds.

Purcher operated a hydraulic die casting plant in
Denver, Colorado. A die casting machine operates
under extremely high pressure and a hydraulic fluid
is used to transmit the pressure. Molten metal is
poured into the die casting machine and the
machine casts or stamps the metal into products.
To keep the metal molten, there must be a furnace
almost immediately adjacent to the die casting
machine.

Being dissatisfied with the hydraulic fluid he
was then using, Purcher wrote the following letter
to Celanese, a supplier of hydraulic fluid, on
March 15:

"If you will ship me 1,200 gallons of Lindol
HF-M hydraulic fluid on the first of each
month for the next twelve months, I will pay
you in cash on delivery $4.25 per gallon. In
acknowledging that this would be a full
year's commitment on your part, you may
consider this purchase order to be non-can-
cellable for thirty days.

s/Purcher"

This letter was received by Celanese on March 17.
On March 18, however, Purcher found a reliable
supplier from whom he could purchase Lindol
HF-M hydraulic fluid at a firm price of $4.00 per
gallon. As a consequence, Purcher promptly tele-
phoned Celanese and said, "I hereby withdraw my
purchase order. It was merely an acknowledgment
proposal which I now wish to cancel." Although
Celanese had not yet shipped the hydraulic fluid, he
objected vigorously and replied, "You're a little late,
Purcher. I've already decided to accept your offer."
Immediately after their telephone conversation,
Celanese telegraphed Purcher:

"I accept your offer for 1,200 gallons of
Lindol HF-M hydraulic fluid per month for
the next year at the quoted price of $4.25 per
gallon."

36. Assume for the purposes of this question that
Purcher is a merchant under the UCC by
virtue of his "knowledge" and "skill" in deal-
ing with goods of this kind. If Purcher persists
in his position that his order was effectively
withdrawn, can Celanese sue him successfully
for breach of contract?

(A) No, because Celanese could effectively
accept Purcher's offer only by the act of
shipping a month's installment of the
hydraulic fluid.

(B) No, because there was no consideration
to make Purcher's offer irrevocable.

(C) Yes, because Purcher's revocation was

ineffective since the purchase order
expressly stated that it was non-can-
cellable.

(D) Yes, because Purcher's order was an

irrevocable order that became a contract
when Celanese accepted it.

37. Assume for the purposes of this question only
that on March 20 a valid contract was entered
into between Purcher and Celanese. In accor-
dance with the terms of their agreement,
Celanese promised "to supply Purcher with
his requirements of Lindol HF-M hydraulic
fluid in monthly shipments for one year com-
mencing on April 1." Purcher in turn
promised to pay Celanese the stipulated price
of $4.25 per gallon. Celanese knew that
Purcher's average daily requirements were 40
gallons, but their contract contained no recital
or estimate thereof. In April, Celanese sup-
plied Purcher with 1,200 gallons of hydraulic
fluid for which Purcher paid $5,100. The next
month Celanese delivered 1,150 gallons
which Purcher paid for at the contract price.
In June, however, a new hydraulic die casting
plant started operating in the neighboring
town of Golden, and Purcher's business began
to decline at once. By August, Purcher's need
for hydraulic fluid had dropped to less than 10
gallons per day. At this time, which of the fol-
lowing best states the legal rights and duties
of the parties under the terms of their agree-
ment?

Regardless of what he decides to do,
Purcher is not liable to Celanese because
the wording of their agreement is too
indefinite to be enforced as a contract.
Due to the unexpected downturn in his
business operations, Purcher can avoid
any further contractual liability by
immediately closing down his hydraulic
die casting plant.
Purcher remains obligated to accept and
pay for his actual monthly requirements
of hydraulic fluid so long as they are not
unreasonably disproportionate to
Purcher's prior requirements.

(D) Purcher remains obligated to accept and

pay for an average of 1,200 gallons of
hydraulic fluid per month for the
remainder of the year because Celanese
promised to supply Purcher's require-
ments on that anticipated basis.

Questions 38-39 are based on the following fact situation.

On April 1, Nu Skin Inc., a wholesale skin care dis-
tributor, wrote the following letter to the La Costa
Spa and Beauty Center:

"Please be advised that we have been granted
an exclusive distributorship for Christiaan
Barnard's GLYCEL Cellular Facial Cleanser.
We hereby offer you at $250 per case (25 bot-
tles per case) for such quantities as you may
need during the balance of this calendar
year."

On April 15, La Costa replied by letter:

"We are thrilled to hear that you will be dis-
tributing Christiaan Barnard's GLYCEL
Facial Cleanser. Our guests and customers
request it more than any other product. We
certainly accept your offer, and expect to use
GLYCEL exclusively to meet all our facial
cleanser requirements the rest of this year."

Thereafter, La Costa ordered and used large quanti-
ties of GLYCEL at its Spa and Beauty Center facil-
ities. Many of its guests and customers even
purchased individual bottles of GLYCEL which La
Costa sold at a retail price of $25 per bottle.
However, on September 30, Nu Skin Inc. sent La
Costa the following letter:

"Sorry to inform you but there has been an
unexpected price increase in the GLYCEL
Cellular Facial Cleanser product. The manu-
facturer has just notified us that the cost of
producing byogenic cellulites, the main
ingredient of GLYCEL, has risen substan-
tially in the last few months necessitating a
price increase from $250 to $300 per case for
the remainder of the year."

After receiving this letter, La Costa concluded that
$300 per case was excessive and then began order-
ing Geraldine Ferraro's Nutra Skin Facial Cleanser
— a popular brand, but less favored and less con-
sumed by La Costa guests and customers from
another wholesaler at $250 per case. Immediately
thereafter, La Costa sued Nu Skin Inc. in a breach
of contract action for money damages.

38. Which of the following is the best legal argu-

ment in support of La Costa's suit?

(A) Nu Skin Inc.'s letter of April 1 was an

offer that became irrevocable because of
La Costa's bargained-for reliance
thereon in ordering and accepting Nu
Skin Inc.'s shipments of GLYCEL from
April through September.

(B) Nu Skin Inc.'s letter of April 1 was a
firm offer of an output contract from
one merchant to another that La Costa
accepted on April 15.

(C) The parties' April 1-15 correspondence

constituted a bilateral contract under
which Nu Skin Inc. agreed to sell and
La Costa agreed to purchase enough
GLYCEL at $250 per case to meet all of
La Costa's requirements for the rest of
the year.

(D) La Costa's first order of GLYCEL in
April was an acceptance of Nu Skin
Inc.'s offer of April 1 for a series of uni-
lateral contracts, and thereby terminated
Nu Skin Inc.'s power of revocation.

39. Assume for the purposes of this question

only that Nu Skin Inc.'s September 30 letter
of a price increase to $300 per case was a
repudiation and total breach of a require-
ments contract. To which of the following
would La Costa be entitled in its action
against Nu Skin Inc.?

I.

The net profits La Costa would have
made from the resale of GLYCEL to its
guests and customers at $25 per bottle
had it been able to purchase the facial
cleanser at $250 per case during the
remainder of the year, less the net prof-
its it made from sales of Geraldine
Ferraro's product during the same
period.

II. Nominal damages only.
III. $50 multiplied by the number of cases
of GLYCEL La Costa would have pur-
chased from September 30 through

Questions 40-41 are based on the following fact situation.

Calvin Cline was a wealthy industrialist who lived
in Nashville. Calvin was extremely proud of his
daughter, Patsy, who graduated from Vanderbilt
Law School and had just passed the Tennessee bar
examination. As a graduation gift, Calvin leased an
office suite for Patsy in The Opray Building, an old
prestigious edifice in downtown Nashville. Calvin
promised Patsy that he would pay the monthly rental
and also renovate and decorate the office for her.

Thereupon, Calvin went ahead and contracted in
writing with Ace Building Co. to renovate Patsy's
new law office according to plans and specifica-
tions prepared by Office Interiors, a famous
Nashville architectural firm. According to the con-
tract with Ace, Calvin agreed to pay Ace $15,000 to
perform the renovation work. The agreement recited
that Calvin was hiring Ace to remodel the office as
a graduation gift to Patsy. Relying on her father's
contract with Ace, Patsy, who had an option to
lease another office in a different building, allowed
the option to expire and so advised Calvin and Ace.

After beginning the renovation work, Ace discov-
ered there was asbestos insulation throughout the
walls and ceilings. As a result, Ace notified Calvin
that in order to renovate the office according to the
plans and specifications provided by Office
Interiors, the asbestos would have to be removed at
an additional cost of $25,000. Neither Calvin nor
Ace had reason to anticipate that the asbestos con-
dition would prevent Ace from performing the
remodeling work as per Office Interiors' specifica-
tions.

40. Assume for the purposes of this question only

that Calvin refuses to pay Ace the additional
$25,000 to remove the asbestos. Thereafter,
Ace notifies Calvin that it will not perform
the remodeling work according to the plans
and specifications as provided. As a result,
which of the following facts, if conceded or
provable, would be most persuasive in sup-
porting an action by Calvin against Ace for
breach of contract?

Prior to entering into the contract with
Ace, Calvin made no representations to
Ace concerning the asbestos insulation
in the office.
At the time Calvin and Ace entered into
their contract, neither party knew that
the office was insulated with asbestos.
Patsy had relied on Ace's promise to
remodel the office by canceling her
option to lease another office.
Ace had agreed to perform the remodel-
ing work as per the plans and specifica-
tions provided by Office Interiors, and it
was physically possible for them to ren-
ovate the office according to those plans
and specifications.

41. Assume for the purposes of this question only

that Ace would not have been excused from
performing the remodeling work according to
the original plans and specifications as pro-
vided by Office Interiors. Upon discovery of
the asbestos, however, Calvin and Ace agreed
to radically alter the renovation work so that
the asbestos did not have to be removed.
Thereafter, Patsy did not learn of the changes
until after Ace completed the remodeling. If
Patsy finds the changes to be unacceptable,
will she succeed in an action against Ace for
not renovating the office according to the
original plans and specifications?

No, because Patsy was only an inciden-
tal beneficiary under the terms of
Calvin's contract with Ace.
No, because Patsy's rights under
Calvin's contract with Ace were subject
to any defenses that Ace could have
raised against Calvin.
Yes, because Calvin and Ace's modifica-
tion of their original contract was invalid
since it was not supported by any new
consideration.
Yes, because Patsy had changed her
position in reliance on the original con-
tract that was entered into between
Calvin and Ace.

43. For this question only, assume the following

facts. Soon after making its contract with
Bouquet, Vintage, without Bouquet's knowl-
edge or assent, sold its vineyards but not its
winery to Agribiz, a large agricultural corpo-
ration. Under the terms of this sale, Agribiz
agreed to sell to Vintage all grapes grown on
the land for five years. Agribiz's employees
have no experience in wine-grape production,
and Agribiz has no reputation in the wine
industry as a grape producer or otherwise.
The Bouquet-Vintage contract was silent on
the matter of Vintage selling any or all of its
business assets.

If Bouquet seeks an appropriate judicial rem-
edy against Vintage for entering into the
Vintage-Agribiz transaction, is Bouquet likely
to prevail?

(A) Yes, because the Vintage-Agribiz trans-
action created a significant risk of
diminishing the profits in which
Bouquet would share under his contract
with Vintage.

(B) Yes, because the Bouquet-Vintage con-
tract did not contain a provision autho-
rizing a delegation of Vintage's duties.
(C) No, because Vintage remains in a posi-
tion to perform under the Bouquet-
Vintage contract.

(D) No, because Vintage, as a corporation,
must necessarily perform its contracts
by delegating duties to individuals.

Questions 42 -43 are based on the following fact situation.

A written contract was entered into between
Bouquet, a financier-investor, and Vintage
Corporation, a winery and grape-grower. The con-
tract provided that Bouquet would invest
$1,000,000 in Vintage for its capital expansion and,
in return, that Vintage, from grapes grown in its
famous vineyards, would produce and market at
least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five
years under the label "Premium Vintage-Bouquet."

The contract included provisions that the parties
would share equally the profits and losses from the
venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be dis-
tributed by Vintage only through Claret, a whole-
sale distributor of fine wines. Neither Bouquet nor
Vintage had previously dealt with Claret. Claret
learned of the contract two days later from reading
a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immedi-
ately hired an additional sales executive and con-
tracted for enlargement of his wine storage and
display facility.

42. If Vintage refuses to distribute the wine

through Claret and Claret then sues Vintage
for breach of contract, is it likely that Claret
will prevail?

(A)

(B)

Yes, because Vintage's performance was
to run to Claret rather than to Bouquet.
Yes, because Bouquet and Vintage could
reasonably foresee that Claret would
change his position in reliance on the
contract.
No, because Bouquet and Vintage did
not expressly agree that Claret would
have enforceable rights under their
contract.
No, because Bouquet and Vintage, hav-
ing no apparent motive to benefit Claret,
appeared in making the contract to have
been protecting or serving only their
own interests.

Questions 45-46 are based on the following fact situation.

After preliminary negotiations, Timberland Comp.,
a lumber manufacturer, and Redwood Fence Comp.
entered into the following written agreement on
May 1, 2006:

"Timberland promises to sell and Redwood
promises to buy 5,000 sections of redwood
stockade fence at $10 per section. Each sec-
tion is to be made of good quality split red-
wood poles and is to be 7 feet in length and 3
feet in height. Delivery to be made on June 1,
2006 with payment no later than thirty days
thereafter."

As per the terms of their contract, Timberland
delivered 5,000 sections of redwood to Redwood's
warehouse facility in Baltimore on June 1st. The
next day Redwood's president, John Woodstock,
inspected the shipment and discovered the pole
sections were all 5 feet long and 2 feet high.
Woodstock then told his warehouse manager that
the poles were non-conforming and to set them
aside until "the problem could be corrected."
Woodstock forgot about the matter until July 1st
when Timberland sent a letter to Redwood
demanding payment. Woodstock failed to respond
to Timberland's letter. There was no further commu-
nication between Timberland and Redwood until
August 1st when Timberland sent another letter to
Redwood demanding payment and threatening legal
action if necessary. Again, Woodstock did not
respond to Timberland's letter; and on September
1st Timberland brought suit against Redwood for
$50,000 or the contract price equivalent.

44. Which of the following correctly states

Redwood's legal rights or liabilities as of
September 1st?

(A) Redwood can return the fence sections
to Timberland and rescind the contract.
(B) Redwood must pay Timberland the rea-
sonable value of the fence sections.
(C) Redwood can require Timberland to

replace the non-conforming tender
with fence sections meeting contract
specifications.

(D) Redwood lost any remedy it may have

had because it failed to notify
Timberland within a reasonable time
that the delivery was non-conforming.

Sparticus, a dealer in antique Italian art, owned a

$10,000 each.

Sparticus then shipped the vases to Guggenheim.
During transit one of the vases broke. When
Guggenheim received the shipment, he opened the
package and saw the broken vase. As a result,
Guggenheim contacted Sparticus to inform him
that he would not perform the contract and would
not accept any of the vases.

48. If Zeller tenders 95 bushels of wheat to Baker

on August 1, and Baker refused to accept or
pay for any of the wheat, which of the follow-

Zeller and Baker?

Zeller has a cause of action against
Baker, because Zeller has substantially
performed his contract.
Zeller is excused from performing his
contract because of impossibility of
performance.
Baker has a cause of action against
Zeller for Zeller's failure to deliver 100
bushels of wheat.
Baker is obligated to give Zeller a rea-

On December 15, Harrison Freeman went to Circuit
City to purchase a television. While browsing
around the store, Harrison saw a 30-inch Zenith
console model #867 that he particularly liked. The
advertised list price for the television set was $500.
Sensing a potential sale, Midge Megdel, a store
clerk, approached Harrison and asked if she could
be of any assistance. Harrison indicated that he
wanted to buy the television but he wouldn't have
enough cash until the following Thursday when he
got paid. Midge advised Harrison to sign a standard
contract for the purchase of the Zenith television so
that he could buy it at the $500 list price since a
price increase would be taking effect after January
1st. Heeding Midge's advice, Harrison signed a
standard contract with Circuit City promising to
buy the television on or before December 30 for the
purchase price of $500.

Circuit City had purchased 10 Zenith model #867
television sets from its distributor at a cost of $300
per television. As such, Circuit City stood to make
a $200 profit on the sale of each Zenith model
#867 television set which it sold.

On December 20, Harrison saw the same television
set being sold by Radio Shack for $395. As a result,
Harrison breached his contract with Circuit City
and purchased the same Zenith television at Radio
Shack, saving himself $105. On December 21
Quincy Quillen entered the Circuit City store and
bought the same Zenith television that Harrison
had contracted to purchase from Midge for the
price of $500.

Despite the fact that Circuit City did not lose any
money as a result of Harrison's breach, nonetheless
they have decided to sue him. Circuit City can also
show that it is able to obtain as many television sets
as it can sell.

47. In an action for breach of contract against

Harrison, Circuit City will most likely recover
the following amount of damages:

$200

49. Which of the following best characterizes

Gelson was the owner of Gelson's Market, the
largest supermarket in the town of Suburb. On
September 10, Gelson sent the following telegram
to Concita, who was the owner of a banana planta-
tion in Panama:

"Subject to your prompt acceptance, ship at
once 200 bushels of your Conquita bananas
to our supermarket. Thereafter, deliver 100
bushels of bananas by the first day of each of
the following three months. Will pay current
market price for all shipments.

s/Galvin Gelson"

This purchase order was received by Concita on
September 11. The next day, he shipped 199
bushels of bananas to Gelson which were received
and accepted on September 19. At the time Gelson
accepted this shipment, he realized that it contained
199 bushels of bananas not the 200 as ordered.
Nonetheless, Gelson promptly paid for the first
shipment as billed. Concita's second shipment of
bananas was received by Gelson on September 30.
This shipment, which contained the full 100
bushels, was accepted and paid for by Gelson.
On October 10, however, Concita wired Gelson
notifying him that no further banana shipments
would be made.

Concita's shipment and Gelson's acceptance
of the first 199 bushels of bananas?

The shipment was an acceptance of
Gelson's offer, and, by accepting the
non-conforming tender, with or without
timely objection, Gelson waived what-
ever rights he may have had against
Concita.
The shipment was an acceptance of
Gelson's offer, and, notwithstanding
Gelson's acceptance of the bananas,
also a breach of an implied promise
by Concita to deliver according to
specifications.
The shipment was a counteroffer, and
Gelson accepted it by paying for the
bananas with knowledge of the shortage.
The shipment was made for purposes of
accommodation only, and, thus Concita
was entitled to cure the non-conforming
tender within a reasonable period of
time.

who was unemployed and needed the money,
agreed. Scott then explained to Pat that he would be
transporting a package to a person named Milo
Meeker. Scott placed the package in the glove com-
partment of the van. Pat never asked nor was told
what was contained in the package. The package
contained a kilo of cocaine.

During the 10 hour drive from Bisbee to
Albuquerque, Pat deliberately refrained from look-
ing into the glove compartment and inspecting the
package. When Pat arrived at Milo's residence in
Albuquerque, he was greeted by Milo who removed
the package from the glove compartment. Moments
later, police arrived at the scene and arrested both
Pat and Milo.

If Pat is charged with violating the aforemen-
tioned New Mexico criminal law statute, he
should be found

(A) guilty because he illegally transported

(B)

the narcotics
guilty, if he should have known that nar-
cotics were contained in the package

( ,) not guilty, unless he had actual knowl-
' edge that the package contained nar-

(D) not guilty, unless a reasonable person
should have inspected the package to
ascertain what it contained

The Anglo-American criminal law is founded upon
certain basic premises which have been more or
less strictly observed by courts and legislatures
when formulating the substantive law of crimes.
These basic premises concern the requirements of
(1) act, (2) mental state, (3) concurrence, (4) harm,
(5) causation, (6) punishment, and (7) legality. The
first of these basic premises concerns the require-
ment of an act. As a general rule, it is commonly
said that conduct, to be criminal, must consist of
something more than a mere "bad state of mind."

1.	 With regard to the requirement of an act, in

which of the following cases would the defen-
dant, if charged with criminal homicide, most
likely be acquitted because there was no act?

Aaron was a chronic sleepwalker. On
Monday, Aaron got into a violent argu-
ment with his next-door neighbor,
Sidney. The next night, while he was
asleep, Aaron left his home and walked
to Sidney's house. He entered the front
door which was unlocked and ascended
the stairs to Sidney's bedroom. While
still sleepwalking, Aaron went inside
and strangled Sidney to death.
(B) Bernie suffered from an incurable

malignant brain tumor. One night he
stabbed his roommate, Reggie, to death.
Bernie later stated that he could remem-
ber the occurrence clearly. A physician
testified that Bernie's brain tumor could
at times deprive him of his ability to
control his movements.

(C) Cassandra was an epileptic who had

experienced seizures in the past. As she
was driving to work one morning, she
had an epileptic seizure. As a result, she
lost control of her vehicle which went
through a red light and struck a group of
school children who were crossing the
street. Two young girls were killed in the
accident.

(D) Dozer, a drug addict, injected himself
with a speedball, containing a mixture
of heroin and cocaine. A few seconds
later, Dozer began to hallucinate.
Believing that he was a rabid dog, Dozer
attacked his girlfriend, Giselle, and bit
off her nose and ears. Giselle died from
her wounds.

Question 4 is based on the following fact situation.

Pickney was wearing a grey London Fog raincoat
when he entered Tony Roma's Restaurant for din-
ner. He placed his raincoat on a coat rack located in
the foyer of the restaurant. After his meal, Pickney
picked up a similar grey raincoat believing it to be
his own. The raincoat which he took, however,
belonged to Floyd, another patron. Pickney left the
restaurant and walked a short distance when he
realized that he had taken the wrong raincoat by
mistake. He then returned to Tony Roma's and
placed Floyd's raincoat back on the coat rack. He
found his raincoat which had been partially hidden
under a stack of other coats.

4.	

If Pickney were arrested and charged with lar-
ceny of Floyd's raincoat, he will most likely
be acquitted because

there was a mistake of fact

(A)
(B) he returned the raincoat after discover-

ing his mistake

(CD he lacked the requisite state of mind
(D) there was no fraudulent conversion

3.	

In which of the following situations could a
court applying the common law doctrine most
likely convict Defendant of the crime charged
despite the Defendant's mistake?

(A) Defendant was charged with assault with
intent to commit rape. He admittedly
ripped off Amelda's panties after mistak-
enly believing that she had consented to
engage in sexual intercourse with him.

(B) Defendant was charged with murder. He
shot and killed Boris after a barroom
argument. Defendant mistakenly thought
that Boris had raised his hand to shoot
him when, in fact, the victim was shak-
ing his fist at Defendant to frighten him.

(C) Defendant was charged with burglary.

She broke into her old boyfriend's home
and took a Gorman painting which she
erroneously believed he had given her
before their relationship ended.
cr2) Defendant was charged with bigamy.
She married Derek five years after her
husband, Domino, was reported missing
after a boating accident. Thereafter,
Domino, who had been rescued,
returned alive. A state statute provides
that a person is presumed dead after six
years of unexplained absence. Defendant
mistakenly believed that the statutory
period was four years.

Question 6 is based on the following fact situation.

Sammy Sapp was asleep in his second floor bed-
room when he heard noises downstairs in the living
room. Sammy took a loaded gun from the night
table and descended the stairs. He saw two burglars
running out the front door. Sammy ran outside try-
ing to catch them. Simultaneously, Vernon Vermeil,
an off-duty plainclothes police officer was driving
his car past Sapp's home when he saw two suspi-
cious men running down the street. Vernon stopped
his car in front of Sapp's house and pulled out his
gun. Vernon got out of the car and started walking
toward Sammy who was standing on the front lawn.
Sammy then saw Vernon with his gun drawn. Not
knowing that Vernon was an off-duty police officer,
Sammy shot him with his pistol. Vernon was
wounded but survived the shooting.

5.	

If Sammy is prosecuted for assault with a
deadly weapon, which of the following would
provide him with his best defense?

(A) He shot Vernon only after seeing him

with his gun drawn and walking toward
him.

(B) He reasonably believed that his life was
in danger when he shot Vernon.
Sammy reasonably believed that Vernon
was one of the participants who was
involved in the burglary.

Inca had been dating Eli for over a year. One day
Inca was walking in Golden Gate Park when she
noticed Eli sitting next to a woman on a park
bench. Inca observed Eli kissing the woman and
passionately embracing her. Despondent by her
boyfriend's public display of infidelity, Inca aim-
lessly began wandering around the vicinity of the
park. As she passed by the Blarney Stone Tavern,
Inca decided to go in and have a drink.

After guzzling down a couple of beers, she started
conversing with Raven, a customer seated next to
her. The two women began commiserating about
their relationships with unfaithful boyfriends. While
they talked, Inca and Raven continued to drink beer
with an occasional shot of Jose Cuervo tequila.
They soon became intoxicated. As they discussed
ways to get back at Eli, Raven suggested that they
set fire to his home. With Inca in agreement, the
two women staggered from the bar and went to Eli's
home.

Under the cover of night, Inca and Raven picked up
little twigs and tree branches and stacked them
along the outside of Eli's home. Inca then lit them
with her cigarette lighter. As the branches ignited in
flames, Inca and Raven hurriedly ran away. Seeing
smoke from his bedroom window, Eli ran outside
and immediately extinguished the fire with a gar-
den hose. The fire slightly charred a small section
of the exterior of Eli's home but did not cause any
significant damage.

6.	

If Inca is prosecuted for common law arson,
she should be found

(A) guilty, unless her intoxication negated

(B)

her criminal intent
guilty, because voluntary intoxication is
no defense since she knew she was set-
ting fire to the dwelling house of

Defendant is paranoid and thinks
Victim's shadow is following him every-

8. Which of the following statements regarding
the entrapment defense is LEAST accurate:

(A)

(B)

It is unconstitutional for the government
to "entrap" a defendant where the defen-
dant lacks a predisposition to commit an
offense.
In most states if the defendant asserts an
entrapment defense, the defendant can-
not at the same time deny the commis-
sion of the offense. However, in federal
prosecutions the entrapment defense is
available even though the defendant
denies one or more elements of the
crime charged.

(D)

(C) Entrapment by estoppel is a recognized
defense where a government official
falsely assures a defendant that his act is
lawful and the defendant reasonably
relies on that advice.
If an undercover federal agent supplies
contraband (e.g., cocaine) to a willing
buyer, the buyer has been entrapped as a
matter of law. Then the prosecution must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant-buyer had a predisposition to
commit the criminal act prior to first
being approached by a government
agent.

Not intending to kill, Defendant hits a
person over the head with a baseball bat.
As a result, the person dies from head
injuries.
Not intending to kill, Defendant throws
a baseball off the top of a four-story
apartment building onto a busy public

Beater was employed as a chemist for the DuPont
Corporation. After work each afternoon, Beater
would customarily have a couple of martinis at
Schooner's Tavern with his cronies before returning
home. When Beater got intoxicated, he often
became violent and physically abused his wife,
Beatee. One evening, Beater came home drunk and
asked Beatee, "What's for dinner?" Beatee replied,
"Your favorite, Dear, hot dogs and beans." Irritated,
Beater slapped Beatee several times across the face
and said, "I'm sick of hot dogs every night. Can't
you ever make anything else?" He then stormed out
of the apartment and told Beatee that he was going
to the bar to have some beef jerkies and beer for
dinner.

A couple hours later, Beatee was looking out the
apartment window when she saw Beater staggering
across the street. He was visibly intoxicated and
clearly had trouble keeping his balance. When
Beater reached the middle of the street, he col-
lapsed and fell face down on the pavement. Seeing
her husband lying in the street, Beatee's initial reac-
tion was to go outside and assist him. However, she
decided not to because she was still angry for the
beating she received earlier in the evening. Minutes
later, Spud was driving his car at an excessive rate
of speed and struck and killed Beater. Spud failed
to see Beater lying in the street because his car
lights were not functioning.

9.	

If Beatee is subsequently charged with
Beater's murder, she should be found

(A) guilty of murder, because she had a duty

to assist him

(B) guilty of murder, only if the jury finds

that she intended to cause her husband's
death

(C) not guilty of murder, but guilty of

manslaughter

(D) not guilty of either murder or

manslaughter, because her failure to
assist Beater was not the actual cause of
his death

Question 12 is based on the following fact situation.

Victim had a serious back condition that resulted
from his military duties while stationed in Iraq.
Following his return home, Physician warned him
that if he ever injured his back, even in a slight
accident or by lifting a heavy object, he could be
permanently paralyzed. Defendant was aware of
Victim's medical condition. One day, after learning
that Victim was dating Defendant's ex-wife,
Defendant became upset and decided to cut off the
legs of Victim's favorite chair, which he did. The
next day, when Victim sat down in his favorite
chair, the chair toppled over and Victim was thrown
to the floor. Victim was immediately taken to the
hospital, but died the next day because of his back's
weak condition. Defendant is charged with the
offense of murder.

Murder in this jurisdiction is defined as the "unlaw-
ful killing of another person with malice afore-
thought." First-degree murder is defined as "pre-
meditated and deliberate killing or any killing dur-
ing the commission of burglary, rape, robbery or
arson. Second-degree murder is all other killings at
common law. Manslaughter is defined as any
unlawful killing without malice when the defendant
acts in the "heat of the blood."

Defendant claims he is not guilty of murder
because he did not intend to kill Victim.

11. Defendant should most likely be found

(A) guilty of first-degree murder
(B) guilty of second-degree murder
(C) not guilty of murder if he was unaware
of Victim's pre-existing medical
condition

(D) not guilty of murder, but guilty of

manslaughter if Defendant was acting in
the "heat of passion" when he cut off the
legs to Victim's chair

Jimbo was a professional tennis player. During a
championship match against Bork, Jimbo dived for
a shot and injured his Achilles tendon. Unable to
continue the match, Jimbo was forced to forfeit the
game to his opponent. Afterwards, the doctor deter-
mined that Jimbo's tendon was severely torn and
placed his leg in a full length cast.

That night Jimbo was extremely depressed because
he knew his injury would cause him to miss the
upcoming U.S. Open Tennis Tournament. To try to
lift his spirits, Jimbo went out for a few drinks with
his friends. As he was sitting at the bar with his
injured leg extended onto the next stool, Bork came
by. Intending to needle Jimbo, Bork said, "Gee,
Jimbo, that was some dive you took. But you know
I would have beat you anyway." Bork then began to
tap his beer bottle against Jimbo's cast. Jimbo,
already sensitive to the fact that his career was in
jeopardy, became very upset and told Bork to "get
lost." When Bork continued to tap his cast, Jimbo
picked up a beer bottle and struck Bork over the
head with it. Bork fell backwards on the floor and
died from the blow. At the time he hit Bork, Jimbo
had been drinking heavily and was visibly
intoxicated.

12. Jimbo is charged with murder. He claims that
the murder should be reduced to manslaugh-
ter. In accordance with the Model Penal Code,
the appropriate standard the court should use
to determine Jimbo's defense is that of

(A)

Yancy and Yolanda Yeager threw a high school
graduation party for their eighteen-year-old son,
York. The party was held at the Yeager home in
Mission Viejo. During the party the Yeagers served
beer and wine to York and his classmates. One of
York's teenage friends, Trina Twilley, became
inebriated after drinking three beers at the party.

When the party ended, Trina decided to drive home
in her automobile despite being intoxicated. She
drove through a red light and crashed into a vehicle
driven by Marshall Macon. Marshall, who was
operating his car with due diligence, was killed in
the accident.

The minimum drinking age for alcoholic beverages
in this jurisdiction is twenty-one. Thereafter, Trina
was prosecuted for involuntary manslaughter. Yancy
and Yolanda were charged with the misdemeanor
offense of furnishing liquor to a minor.

13. Assume for the purposes of this question that

Trina was acquitted but Yancy and Yolanda
were convicted. Following Trina's acquittal,
the prosecuting attorney decided to prosecute
Yancy and Yolanda for involuntary
manslaughter. Which of the following would
provide the defendants with their best
defense?

(A) Double Jeopardy.
(B) Res Judicata.
(C) Collateral Estoppel.
(D) Their actions were not the proximate

cause of the victim's death.

Belle and Ramirez were unemployed basket
weavers who had recently been terminated from
their jobs. As they were commiserating their
misfortune, Belle thought of a great "get rich
quick" scheme to defraud his insurance company.
Belle told Ramirez that he was insured under a
State Farm policy covering personal injuries. He
suggested that Ramirez shoot him in the arm in a
fake robbery attempt so that he could file a phony
insurance claim to recover damages for his injury.
In this jurisdiction it is a felony to file a false
insurance claim.

As part of their scheme, Ramirez went to Belle's
home one evening with a loaded pistol. They were
standing together in the kitchen discussing how to
best implement their plan. Finally, Belle told
Ramirez to shoot him in the arm and then flee from
the residence. After being shot, Belle planned to
call 911 and have an ambulance transport him to
the hospital where he would be treated for his
wound. Following Belle's instruction, Ramirez pro-
ceeded to shoot Belle in the arm. Thereupon, Belle
telephoned 911 to report the shooting and requested
an ambulance immediately be sent to his home.

Believing that Belle only suffered a superficial arm
wound, Ramirez drove home after the shooting. The
bullet, however, severed an artery and Belle began
to bleed quite profusely. Before the ambulance
arrived, Belle lost consciousness from the loss of
blood and passed out on the kitchen floor. When
the paramedics arrived at Belle's home, they were
unable to revive him and he was pronounced dead
at the scene.

14. Which of the following is the most serious
crime for which Ramirez should be found
guilty?

(A) Felony-murder

convenience store. He planned to use a toy pistol
that resembled a real gun. At no time did Justin
intend to injure anybody.

The following day, Justin entered Campy's with the
toy pistol tucked under his shirt. As he approached
the counter, the gun slipped from his shirt and
rolled onto the floor. As Justin went to retrieve it,
Campy, the proprietor, saw what was taking place
and pulled out his own pistol. Believing that a
robbery was afoot, Campy fired his gun at Justin.
The bullet missed Justin but struck a customer,
killing her instantly. Justin then fled without taking
any money.

each pledge was required to perform an act to
demonstrate his courage and manhood.

Accompanied by a group of ZEM members, Skakel
went to the State Street overpass that extended
across Interstate Highway 95. The overpass was ele-
vated at an upper level approximately fifty feet
above the highway.

Skakel then pulled out a five pound bowling ball
that he had been carrying in a bag. He lobbed the
ball from the overpass onto the highway below.
Skakel had hoped that the ball would fall harm-
lessly to the pavement. However, the ball crashed
through the front windshield of a car driven by
Mahorn. The bowling ball struck Mahorn causing
him to lose control of his vehicle. The car swerved
across the highway and crashed into a telephone
pole. Mahorn was killed in the wreckage.

In this jurisdiction first degree murder is defined as
any willful killing of another human being commit-
ted with premeditation or deliberation. Second
degree murder covers all other unlawful killings
with express or implied malice aforethought.
Manslaughter is defined as any homicide commit-
ted as a result of adequate provocation or caused by
defendant's criminal negligent conduct.

top of the desk, picked it up and placed it inside her
pocketbook. She then walked across the hallway to
the bathroom and poured the medicine down the
toilet. Later that same afternoon, Professor Bork
had a violent asthma attack and went to his office
urgently in need of his medicine. Unable to find his
medicine, Professor Bork's breathing became seri-
ously impaired and he lost consciousness. A few
minutes later, Professor Bork was found dead lying
on his office floor. An autopsy report listed the
cause of death as an acute asthma attack and con-
cluded that he would have survived had he taken
his medicine.

21. If Vinnie is charged with conspiracy for

Question 21 is based on the following fact situation.

Margo Miranda and Tyler Tarlow were third-year
students at New York University Law School.
During their last semester Margo and Tyler were
enrolled in Professor Bork's Morality of the Law
class. Professor Bork, who had a reputation as
being NYU's most unpopular faculty member
because of his perennial low grades, failed Margo
and Tyler. On account of their failing "F" grades,
Margo and Tyler did not have enough credits to
graduate and were forced to attend summer school.

Shortly thereafter, Margo and Tyler were in the law
school lounge and discussing how much they hated
Professor Bork. Margo and Tyler both knew that
Professor Bork suffered from a serious asthma con-
dition which necessitated frequently taking medi-
cine to assist in his breathing. Margo, who was
aware that Professor Bork kept his medicine locked
in a desk drawer in his office, suggested that they
take his medicine and throw it away. Tyler agreed
that it was a great idea and said, "Well, he may have

then responded, "Yea. Let's hope he does and then
he won't be able to breathe." Unknown to either
Margo or Tyler, their conversation was overheard by
Vinnie Del Negro another student who Professor
Bork had flunked.

Vinnie who also hated Professor Bork, decided to
join Margo and Tyler and participate in their plan.
Although Vinnie didn't say anything to either
Margo or Tyler, he immediately went to Professor
Bork's office, broke into his locked desk with a
penknife and found the bottle of medicine. He then
left the bottle on top of the desk so it could easily
be found by Margo and Tyler. Vinnie then hurriedly
left the room. A few minutes later, Margo and Tyler
went to Professor Bork's office. As they were about
to enter, Tyler got "cold feet" and said, "I've
changed my mind...I don't want to go through with
this." As Tyler started to walk away, Margo said,
"You coward. I'll handle this slimeball by myself."

Question 23 is based on the following fact situation.

On Monday, Able, Baker and Charlie agreed to rob
the First National Bank on the following Friday
morning. The next day, Tuesday, Charlie, without
notifying Able or Baker, stole a car to be used as
the getaway vehicle in the robbery. The next day,
Wednesday, Charlie was arrested by the police for
parole violations and was placed in jail without
bail. Nevertheless, Able and Baker proceed with
their plan to rob the bank. Baker, however, is a
police informant who notifies the police of the
pending robbery. The police wait at the bank and
arrest Able as he enters the bank. Conspiracy in this
jurisdiction requires proof of an overt act in addi-
tion to an agreement.

23. Charlie may be convicted of?

(A) Theft of the car only
(B) Theft and either conspiracy to commit
robbery or attempted robbery, but not
both

(C) Theft and attempted robbery only
(D) Theft, conspiracy to commit robbery,

Divoc and Igor were short-order cooks who worked
at Zucky's Restaurant in Hampton Heights. Divoc
was extremely displeased with his job and con-
stantly complained about the low wages and long
hours. One day Divoc approached Igor and told him
about a foolproof scheme to rob a local bank. At
first Igor thought Divoc was kidding and shrugged
off the suggestion as though it were a joke. But
Divoc persisted and asked Igor to assist him in the
robbery by driving the getaway car. Igor then
changed his mind and agreed to participate in the
bank robbery.

On the day appointed for the commission of the
crime, Igor drove over to Divoc's house and picked
him up. Thereupon, Divoc instructed Igor to drive
to the Evergreen Bank where the holdup was to
take place. On the way to the bank, Igor explained
that he needed to stop and buy a pack of cigarettes.
Moments later, Igor saw a 7-11 Store, which was
located about three miles from the bank, and pulled
into the parking lot. While Divoc waited in the car,
Igor went inside the store and started having second
thoughts about his involvement in the robbery. He
then decided to withdraw from the crime and hur-
ried to a pay telephone at the back of the store.

He called the local 911 emergency number and told
the dispatcher that a robbery was about to take
place at the Evergreen Bank and please notify the
police immediately. The dispatcher, however,
thought that Igor was a crank caller and did not
take him seriously. After Igor realized that the dis-
patcher was not going to take any affirmative
action, he then reached into his pocket to get a
quarter to call the police. Unfortunately, Igor did
not have any more pocket change to make another
call. He then proceeded back to the parking lot and
noticed that his car was missing. Igor had left his
keys in the car and the engine running when he
went inside the store. When he didn't emerge right
away, Divoc got nervous and drove off by himself

While Igor pondered his next move, Divoc went to
the bank and carried out the robbery. After collect-
ing his booty, Divoc fled the crime scene in Igor's
car. With the police in hot pursuit, Divoc ran
through a red light and crashed into a truck driven
by Puhl. Divoc and Puhl were both killed in the
collision.

Question 25 is based on the following fact situation.

Jesse was the leader of the notorious "Hole In The
Wall Gang" which consisted of a group of thugs
who committed a string of robberies, burglaries and
thefts in the Sheepmeadow section of Brownsville.
After committing a number of smaller crimes
mostly in the residential section of town, Jesse
decided to go "big time" and rob the First National
Bank in the heart of downtown Brownsville.

As part of the plan, Jesse and James would enter
the bank while Raven, the only female member of
the gang, would drive the getaway car. As they were
driving to the bank on the morning of the robbery,
Jesse saw a hitchhiker thumbing a ride. He ordered
Raven to stop the car and pick up the hitchhiker.
When the hitchhiker named Mitch entered the car,
Jesse asked him where he was going. Mitch
responded that he was going to Baytown which was
located about 5 miles north of Brownsville.

A few minutes later, the car pulled up in front of
the bank and Jesse turned to Mitch and said,
"Listen, buddy, we're going inside and rob this
place. I want you to stay in the car with Raven and
help her keep a lookout for any cops." Startled by
the chain of events Mitch feigned agreement by
shaking his head.

Jesse and James then entered the bank and bran-
dishing their weapons ordered everyone on the
floor. They went to the nearest counter and com-
manded the teller to fill up a bag with all the cash
she had in the drawer. After they were handed the
loot, Jesse and James fled to the car and made a
hasty getaway. While the bank robbery was in
progress, Mitch remained in the car and sat silently
in fear.

The group then sped toward Baytown where their
hideout was located. Upon reaching Baytown, they
drove Mitch to his destination. As he was leaving
the vehicle, Jesse gave him a $100 bill and thanked
him for his help.

25. With respect to Mitch's criminal liability,
which of the following statements is most
accurate?

(A) Mitch is guilty of bank robbery as an

accomplice.

(B) Mitch is guilty of bank robbery as a co-

conspirator.

Harry Sapiens was a lawyer who worked in the law
firm of Scylla and Charybdis, located in
Amityville, Ames. Harry, who had a reputation of
being a prankster, decided to play a practical joke
on Seymour Scylla, the senior partner of the law
firm. Harry donned a cowboy mask and entered
Mr. Scylla's office. As Mr. Scylla was talking on
the phone with his back to the door, Harry pulled
out a toy cap gun and said, "This is a stickup...give
me your wallet or I shoot." When Mr. Scylla turned
around to face Harry, he pulled the trigger of the
gun. This caused the toy pistol to make a loud
noise, but Mr. Scylla was not struck by anything.

Although Mr. Scylla was not frightened, he fired
Harry because of the incident citing unprofessional
conduct. Harry was subsequently charged with
criminal assault under the above mentioned penal
code statute. At trial, Harry testified that he was

Marshall and Tucker were longtime friends who
had served in Vietnam together. Marshall was
despondent after experiencing a number of
personal tragedies. After getting laid off from his
job as a pizza deliveryman, Marshall's wife, Flo,
divorced him. Following the divorce, Marshall's
home was destroyed by a tornado and all his
personal belongings were destroyed. To make
matters even worse, Marshall lost his life savings
when he purchased stock in a west Texas oil
company that went bankrupt.

Knowing that Marshall was extremely disconsolate,
Tucker suggested that they get together and have a
few beers at a local watering hole. As they were
drinking, Marshall told Tucker that he was planning
to burglarize the home of his wealthy aunt, Juanita,
and steal her jewelry. Marshall asked Tucker if he
was interested in taking part in the burglary and
assisting him. When Tucker refused, Marshall said,
"O.K. chickenshit, I'm gonna commit the crime
myself, but I have a proposition for you. If you let
me stash the jewels at your house until the heat's
off, I'll give you her diamond necklace." Tucker
agreed.

Two nights later, while Juanita was away on vaca-
tion, Marshall broke into his aunt's home and stole
her jewelry which was worth over $100,000.
Afterwards, Marshall went to Tucker's house.
Tucker permitted him to come inside and told
Marshall he could leave the jewels in the attic. The
next day, Tucker had second thoughts about his
criminal involvement. He immediately called the
police who came to his home and recovered all of
the stolen jewels. Upon questioning, Tucker told the
police that Marshall committed the burglary. The
police subsequently arrested Marshall and Tucker.

would repay the loan and if he did, Defendant
would be able to handle him somehow, even by
paying him for the ring if necessary. Two days later,
Johnson came in with the money to reclaim his

person over the age of eighteen who knowingly
engages in sexual intercourse with a person under
the age of sixteen is guilty of statutory rape."
Doofus attended a convention for librarians in the
city of Lost Virtues in State Red. He and several
other librarians visited the Pussy Kat Club, which
featured "exotic dancers." After performing her act
on stage, exotic dancer Bunny sat down at Doofus'
table and asked him, "Will you buy me a drink,
honey?" Doofus bought Bunny several glasses of
champagne at $15 a glass, and arranged to meet her
at a nearby motel, The Love Nest, after closing
time. Bunny met Doofus at the motel and they
engaged in sexual intercourse. Following their love-
making, Bunny asked Doofus for $200, but Doofus
responded, "This was for love; I'm not going to
ruin this beautiful experience by involving money
in it." Bunny responded, "I think I'll call the police
because I'm only 15 years old." Although Bunny
was mature in appearance, she was one month shy
of her sixteenth birthday when she engaged in inter-
course with Doofus. The police arrested Doofus
and asked him whether he had asked Bunny how
old she was. Doofus replied, "Golly, no, officer.
She's a stripper!" Doofus was charged with statu-

At Doofus' trial, the judge gave the following jury
instruction, over objections by the defense: "If
you find that the defendant engaged in sexual
intercourse with the prosecutrix (Ms. Bunny), there
is a presumption that the defendant was aware of
her age."

38. Was the jury instruction proper?

(A) Yes, because statutory rape is a strict lia-

bility offense.

(B) Yes, because Doofus had a duty, under

these circumstances, to inquire as to
Bunny's age.

(C) No, because Doofus did not know that

she was underage.

Rowdy's possessions were taken from him and

Dumpor owned a forty acre tract of farmland
located in a rural section of northeastern Kansas.
He conducted a small farming operation on the
property and grew corn, broccoli, and other vegeta-
bles which he sold to local produce companies.
One day, the county police received an anonymous
tip that Dumpor was growing marijuana on his
farm. Acting on this information, the police flew
over his farm in a surveillance plane and took
pictures of the landscape using a special camera
with a telescopic lens.

After the pictures were developed, they revealed
what appeared to be marijuana plants growing
alongside a section of the corn crop. In an
unmarked vehicle, two undercover police officers
then drove to Dumpor's farm. They climbed over a
chain-linked fence and walked around the farm.
While surveying the terrain, they came upon a
small marijuana patch. The officers then noticed
fresh footprints that led from the marijuana patch to
a nearby cabin.

Believing that marijuana was being stored in the
cabin, the police officers decided to immediately
secure a search warrant. After obtaining the war-
rant, they returned to Dumpor's farm and entered
the cabin. Inside the cabin, the police found a large
cache of marijuana that had been recently har-
vested. Dumpor was then arrested and charged with
unlawful possession of marijuana.

43. Dumpor files a pretrial motion to suppress the

marijuana as evidence on grounds of an ille-
gal search and seizure. The motion should be

denied, because the officers secured a
warrant before entering the cabin,
despite the fact that their earlier actions
may have been unlawful
denied, because the warrant was validly
issued and based upon information law-
fully obtained
granted, because the marijuana was the
fruit of an illegal search and seizure
since the police did not have probable
cause to conduct overflight surveillance
granted, because the police were unlaw-
fully on Dumpor's property when the
marijuana patch was initially discovered

Question 45 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 46 is based on the following fact situation.

Marissa was driving home late at night after attend-
ing a party. O'Reilly, a patrol officer, witnessed her
driving five miles over the posted speed limit. After
making a traffic stop, O'Reilly proceeded to do a
computer check to determine if there were any
outstanding warrants for Marissa. The dispatcher at
the police station told O'Reilly that there were two
outstanding warrants for nonpayment of traffic
tickets. As a result, Marissa was placed under
arrest. She was then handcuffed and placed in the
back seat of the patrol car.

O'Reilly then walked back to her car and
proceeded to search the interior. The officer then
noticed a plastic bag containing marijuana lying
under the front seat of the vehicle. Thereafter,
Marissa was charged with illegal possession of a
controlled dangerous substance.

45. Prior to trial Marissa's attorney filed a motion
to suppress introduction of the marijuana into
evidence. The motion should be

(A) denied, because a law enforcement offi-

cer may lawfully search the passenger
compartment of a car incident to a valid
traffic stop

(B) denied, because the search was incident

(C)

to a lawful arrest
granted, because the police did not have
probable cause to search the car
(D) granted, because the search violated

Marissa's Fourth Amendment protection
against unreasonable search and seizure

At about 2:00 p.m. a reliable police informant tele-
phoned the police and reported seeing two men in
a red van selling narcotics outside a local high
school. The informant gave a detailed description of
the two men and the license number of the vehicle.
A patrol car was immediately dispatched to the
high school location. A few minutes later, the
police saw a van matching the description parked
about two blocks from the high school location.
When the police approached, they saw one man
fitting the description as provided and also saw a
woman in the back seat of the van. Then they saw
the woman leave the van and walk across the street
to a bus stop.

The police proceeded to the van and opened the
doors of the vehicle. The police then pried open a
locked toolcase that was situated in the rear of the
vehicle. Inside, the police found an envelope which
contained about one gram of cocaine. They then
placed the driver of the vehicle under arrest.
Immediately thereafter, the police opened the
glove compartment and found a small amount
of marijuana.

Thereupon, one of the officers walked across the
street to where the woman (who was seen leaving
the van) was standing. The officer went ahead and
took her purse and looked inside. There he found a
packet containing a gram of cocaine. The woman
was then placed under arrest and charged with pos-
session of a controlled dangerous substance.

46. The driver of the van was subsequently prose-
cuted and charged with two counts of posses-
sion of controlled dangerous substances. He
filed a motion to exclude the cocaine and
marijuana from evidence. His motion will
most likely be granted with respect to

Question 47 is based on the following fact situation.

Mike Maier was an unemployed father who had
three young children. His oldest son, Jeffrey,
wanted to play little league baseball but didn't own
a glove. Mike went to Tarasco's Sporting Goods
Store in Queens and stole a black outfielder's glove
for his son. As Mike was leaving the store, a clerk
saw the glove bulging under Maier's jacket. The
clerk ran outside and yelled to a nearby police offi-
cer, "Stop that man, he just stole a baseball glove."
The police officer proceeded to detain Maier. At the
time he was being detained, Maier did not respond
to the clerk's accusation. Thereafter Maier was
taken to the police station and charged with larceny.
At the stationhouse, he was given his Miranda
warnings for the first time.

At trial, Maier took the stand and testified on his
own behalf and denied committing the crime.
During final arguments, the prosecuting attorney
posed the question that if the defendant was inno-
cent, why did he remain silent and not deny culpa-
bility at the time of his detention. Defendant's
attorney objected to the prosecutor's comment.

47. The trial court judge will in all likelihood rule

that the prosecutor's comment was

(A)

(B)

improper, because it violates defendant's
Miranda protection
improper, because the defendant has the
right to remain silent

(C) proper, because no Miranda warnings

were given when Maier was detained by
the police

(D) proper, because the prosecuting attorney
did not misstate the evidence or express
his personal opinion as to the truth of
the evidence

Question 48 is based on the following fact situation.

48. Under which of the following fact situations
would Defendant's Miranda waiver most
likely be ineffective?

(A) Defendant recently graduated from

Georgetown Law Center. At her gradua-
tion party, Defendant became highly
intoxicated after drinking a pint
of whiskey. Following the party,

CRIMINAL LAW

Defendant attempted to drive home in
her automobile. She fell asleep at the
wheel and crashed into another vehicle,
injuring the driver. Shortly after the
accident, a police officer came on the
scene and arrested Defendant, charging
her with D.U.I. The Defendant was then
given her Miranda warnings and trans-
ported to the police station. Upon ques-
tioning, Defendant, who was still highly
intoxicated, waived her Miranda rights
and made an incriminating statement.

(B) Defendant stabbed victim after a violent
argument. Following the victim's death,
the police arrested Defendant and
charged him with murder. He was trans-
ported to the stationhouse where
Miranda warnings were given.
Afterwards the Defendant was interro-
gated and proceeded to waive his
Miranda rights. He then confessed to
committing the crime. At trial, a psychi-
atrist testified that Defendant was men-
tally ill and his confession was not the
result of a knowing and intelligent waiver.

(C) Defendant was a 15-year-old boy who
was a high school sophomore. He pos-
sessed normal intelligence and experi-
ence for a youth of his age. One night he
and two friends attended a concert in
Central Park. After the concert, Defendant
and his friends went on a "wilding"
spree assaulting and robbing a number
of victims in the park. The next day
Defendant was arrested and received
proper Miranda warnings. After being
subjected to persistent questioning for
two hours, Defendant waived his
Miranda rights and made a confession.
At trial, Defendant claims that he did not
make a knowing and intelligent waiver.

(D) Defendant was a 16-year-old juvenile

who was in police custody on suspicion
of murder. He was given his Miranda
warnings and then requested to have his
probation officer present. He had been
on probation for a series of juvenile
offenses. His request was denied. During
a brief interrogation, Defendant pro-
ceeded to waive his Miranda rights and
made incriminating statements that
linked him with the crime. At trial,
Defendant's lawyer claims that his
waiver was ineffective because his
request to see the probation officer was
the equivalent of asking for a lawyer.

Question 49 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 50 is based on the following fact situation.

Dave was arrested on a charge of receiving stolen
property. After being properly advised of his
Miranda rights, Dave invoked his right to remain
silent and requested to see his attorney. Several
days later, Dave was arraigned and placed in a cell
with Innis. Unknown to Dave, Innis was a police
informant who had been assigned to Dave's cell
with specific instructions to listen to Dave in order
to obtain information about Dave's crime. Innis
was expressly told not to ask any questions about
the crime, but to "act normal" and "be yourself."
While in the cell together, Innis boasted about the
number of crimes he had committed without being
caught. Not to be outdone, Dave responds with
several statements implicating himself in a large
stolen property enterprise. When Dave is brought
to trial, the prosecution seeks to put Innis on the
stand to testify regarding his jail cell conversations
with Dave.

49. The trial court should rule that this testimony

is

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

inadmissible, because it is violative of
Dave's rights against self-incrimination
inadmissible, because it is violative of
Dave's right to counsel
admissible, because Dave had been
given proper Miranda warnings
admissible, because there was no inter-
rogation

The state of Marlboro has recently enacted the fol-
lowing anti-smoking statute:

"It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to
smoke a cigarette, cigar or pipe in any restau-
rant, bar, cafe or other establishment within
the state that serves food, beer, wine or
liquor. Whoever violates this ordinance shall
be fined not more than five hundred dollars,
or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or
both."

Nick O'Teen was tried in state court for violating
the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evi-
dence consisted of the testimony of Philip Morris,
a patron of Chesterfield's Bar and Grill, who was
disturbed by O'Teen's cigar smoking at the restau-
rant. At the close of all the evidence, O'Teen's
lawyer moved for a dismissal of the charge on the
ground that applying the statute to smoking at a
public restaurant would violate the defendant's
equal protection rights. The trial judge agreed and
granted the motion.

The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a
statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such
circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the
prosecutor decided not to reprosecute O'Teen.
However, the city attorney in the city in which
Chesterfield's was located then sought to prosecute
O'Teen for the same incident under the city's anti-
smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state
statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only
witness Philip Morris, who testified at O'Teen's
first trial. O'Teen moved to dismiss on the ground
that the prosecution of the city charge would violate
his rights against double jeopardy.

50. The court should

(A) grant the motion, because jeopardy
attached in the first prosecution
(B) grant the motion, because the law and

the evidence will be identical at the sec-
ond trial

(C) deny the motion, because the city and
the state are separate sovereigns

(D) deny the motion, because the granting of
O'Teen's motion to dismiss was not a
judgment of acquittal since it did not
resolve any factual elements of the
statutory offense

Question 3 is based on the following fact situation.

Pudge sued Dickens for personal injuries arising
from an automobile accident. Pudge claimed that
Dickens drove through a stop sign at an intersection
without first coming to a complete stop. Dickens
denied driving through the stop sign and contended
that he came to a full stop before entering the inter-
section. At trial, Pudge called Wagner to testify that
he witnessed the accident and that Dickens did not
stop at the stop sign.

On cross-examination, Wagner admits that he was
standing 200 feet away from the intersection when
he witnessed the accident. Defense counsel thus
claims that Wagner was too far away to accurately
see whether Dickens failed to stop at the stop sign.

3.	

Dickens' attorney moves to have the judge
strike Wagner's testimony based upon the fact
that Wagner did not accurately observe the
facts to which he has testified. In responding
to defendant's objection, the judge should
admit the testimony if she finds that

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

it is supported by a preponderance of the
evidence
it is supported by clear and convincing
evidence
there is sufficient evidence for the jury
to conclude that the witness has first-
hand knowledge
it is relevant to prove a fact in issue

Dryden is tried on a charge of driving while
intoxicated. When Dryden was booked at the
police station, a videotape was made that
showed him unsteady, abusive, and speaking
in a slurred manner. If the prosecutor lays a
foundation properly identifying the tape,
should the court admit it in evidence and
permit it to be shown to the jury?

(A) Yes, because it is an admission.
(B) Yes, because its probative value is not

substantially outweighed by unfair prej-
udice.

(C) No, because the privilege against self-

incrimination is applicable.

(D) No, because specific instances of con-
duct cannot be proved by extrinsic evi-
dence.

Question 2 is based on the following fact situation.

Kaufman was arrested and charged with robbery.
Upon being taken into custody, he was given his
Miranda rights and then taken to the police station
for booking. While at the stationhouse, Kaufman
told the arresting officer, O'Toole, that he was
prepared to make a confession. O'Toole then
turned on a video recorder and videotaped
Kaufman's confession.

2.	

At trial, the prosecution called O'Toole to
testify to the incriminating statements that
Kaufman made in his confession. Upon
objection by Kaufman's attorney, O'Toole's
proposed testimony is

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

inadmissible, because the videotape is
the best evidence of Kaufman's
confession
inadmissible, because it is hearsay not
within any recognized exception

(D) Decker is being prosecuted for bigamy
resulting from a common law marriage
to Grace, followed by a ceremonial mar-
riage to Rebecca. Decker contends that
he was never married to Grace. At trial,
the prosecution calls Rebecca as a wit-
ness. She refuses to testify invoking a
statute that excuses a "spouse" from
being called in a criminal proceeding to
testify against a marital partner. Under
such a statute, Rebecca would not be
considered a spouse if Decker already
was married to Grace when he pur-
ported to marry Rebecca. In order to
determine whether Rebecca may invoke
such a statute, the issue which must ulti-

Poole. During the trial, Jasper proposes
to testify that moments before Poole
died, he came upon the victim, who had
been severely beaten and covered with
blood, and that Poole told him. "Weaver
stabbed me." Before admitting Jasper's
testimony, a question arises as to
whether Poole was under a sense of
impending death when he made his
statement. Who decides the factual ques-
tion?

(B) Blair was employed as a truck driver for
Shell Oil Company. On his way to make
a delivery, he drove through a red light
and crashed into Plank's car. Plank sued
Shell to recover damages for injuries
suffered in the collision. At trial, Plank
proposes to testify that immediately
after the accident, Blair said, "I was
lighting my cigarette and didn't see the
red light." Before admitting Plank's tes-
timony, a question arises as to whether
Blair was under the necessary state of
excitement in order for his statement to
qualify as an excited utterance. Who
decides this factual question?
(C) Palmer was injured when his car was

struck by a train at a railroad crossing.
Two days after the accident the engineer
was interviewed by a representative of
the state Public Utilities Commission.
Following the interview, the engineer
signed a statement concerning his ver-
sion of the accident. Thereafter, Palmer
brought suit against the railroad com-
pany to recover damages. The engineer
died before trial, and his statement is
now offered into evidence. Before
admitting the statement, a question
arises as to whether the railroad com-
pany obtained such statement in the reg-
ular course of business. Who decides

Minkoff for personal injuries, claiming that
Minkoff was negligent in his operation of the motor
vehicle. In his pleadings, Minkoff alleged that
Knepper was contributorily negligent by failing to

Jack Flash was a guitarist and lead singer for The
Stoners, a rock and roll band. While he was per-
forming a concert at the Altamont Convention
Center, an overhead strobe light fell on stage strik-

hospitalized for an extended period of time.
Moonglow Visuals Inc. was hired by Altamont to

many rides and amusements for the youngsters.
One of the highlights of the fair was a petting zoo
where children could feed baby goats, piglets and
little calves. The owner of the petting zoo was
Jethro Tull.

Children entering the petting zoo could purchase a
small package of carrots for $1 to feed the animals.
Both Sonja and Stu bought the carrots and were
walking around the zoo area feeding the animals.
Sonja approached a baby goat who began nibbling
on a carrot that she was holding. As the baby goat
was devouring the carrot, it suddenly bit Sonja's
hand causing a deep gash. Jethro, who witnessed
the incident, immediately ran to Sonja and said,
"I'm terribly sorry, I'll pay you $100."

Brando was on trial for murder. Following a recess,
Brando was in the hallway outside the courtroom
speaking with his attorney. During their conversa-

deal." Brando's statement was overheard by the
presiding judge as he was walking down the corri-
dor to the restroom. The judge then informed the
prosecuting attorney of Brando's comment. After
trial is reconvened, the prosecutor calls the judge as
a witness to testify to what he heard the defendant
tell his attorney.

9.	

Upon objection by defendant's attorney, may
the judge be called as a witness?

(A) No, because Brando's statement was a
confidential communication and pro-
tected under the attorney-client privi-
lege.

(B) No, because a judge may not testify in a
matter over which he or she is presiding.

(C) Yes, because a judge has a duty to dis-

permanent loss of eyesight in that eye. Hudson sued
Dr. Iris for malpractice on the theory that the physi-

had she been advised of such a risk, she would not
have consented to the operation. As a result,
Hudson contends that Dr. Iris lacked the "implied
consent" to perform such an operation.

On the other hand, Dr. Iris claims that she did in
fact warn Hudson that there was a risk of losing
eyesight from such an operation. At trial, Hudson
calls Peltz to testify that Dr. Iris performed a simi-
lar operation on him six months earlier. Peltz testi-
fies that although his operation was successful, Dr.
Iris did not warn him of any risk of losing eyesight.

Lavin was the varsity basketball coach of the boys
team at Westwood High School. After the second
game of the season, Lavin was suddenly dismissed
as the coach for undisclosed reasons. After the
dismissal was made public, the local newspaper
The Westwood Tribune ran an article discussing
Lavin's tenure as coach. The article, which was
written by the Tribune's sports editor, Bibby, stated
that "Lavin was a bad role model and morally unfit
for the coaching job."

13. Lavin brought suit against the newspaper for
defamation. At trial, Lavin called Wooden, a
player on the Westwood basketball team, to
testify that "Lavin was a good role model and
respected by the players." In presenting its

the following statements is correct?

(A) Defendant may introduce evidence to

show truthfulness.

(B) Defendant may introduce evidence to

Vegas is on trial for criminal fraud. The defense
calls Reno as a "character witness". He testifies
that he has known Vegas for 11 years and that he
has a good reputation for honesty. After testifying
on direct, the prosecution does not cross-examine
Reno and he is excused from the courtroom.

During the rebuttal stage of trial, the prosecution
seeks to admit into evidence an investigative report
by the F.B.I. which contains the following state-

laundering operations."

15. The defendant's attorney objects to the admis-

Hemlock, a resident of Minneapolis, went to Ixtapa,
a Mexican resort, for a two-week Christmas vaca-

artifacts and little trinkets which he took back on
the airplane. After arriving in Minneapolis, a cus-
toms officer at the airport discovered a small
amount of heroin in an Aztec sculpture that
Hemlock was bringing back from Mexico. He was
immediately arrested and prosecuted for illegal
possession and importation of a controlled danger-
ous substance. During his trial Hemlock testified
that he was unaware that the sculpture contained
any drugs. He further testified that he was not the
owner of the artifact but was merely delivering it as
a favor for an art dealer whose acquaintance he
made while in Ixtapa. The prosecuting attorney then
called Whelan to the stand. Whelan proposed to
testify that fourteen years earlier, Hemlock was
convicted of importing cocaine in a wood carving

Sadie Sadler was driving home after attending the
opening night performance of the musical Cats at the
Shubert Theatre. Sadie was turning her automobile
into her driveway at about 11:00 p.m. when she
stopped to light a cigarette. It was a dark and rainy
evening and Sadie didn't realize that the rear of her
car extended out into the south bound lane of
Palisades Road. As she was lighting her cigarette,
her car was struck by a vehicle driven by Morley
Morgan. The front bumper of Morley's car rammed
into the rear bumper of Sadie's car, causing it to
overturn. Sadie was seriously injured in the collision.

Sadie sued Morley to recover for the injuries she
suffered in the accident. At trial, Sadie called Nettie
Newman, a neighbor, to testify. Nettie testified that
she was outside walking her dog when the accident
occurred. She further testified that she saw
Morley's car "going at least seventy miles per hour"
when he crashed into Sadie. Nettie denied making
any contrary statements regarding the accident.

During Morley's case, Morley called Patrolman
Paye, the police officer who investigated the
accident, to testify. Paye testified that Nettie made
a statement to him that he (Paye) had passed on to
the other officer, who ultimately wrote up the
official police report. Thereupon, Paye identified
the police report, described how it was formulated
and kept, and said that he had signed the report

Blue, an independent taxi driver, took his car to
Aamco Transmissions to have the transmission
repaired. Owens, Aamco's employee, was working
on the transmission when the hydraulic lift broke.
This caused the car to plummet on top of Owens,
injuring him. Blue, who happened to be standing
nearby, saw the incident and rushed over to help
Owens. As Blue tried to free Owens from the metal
entanglement, the hydraulic pump (an apparatus
connected to the lift) suddenly burst, propelling a
sharp metallic fragment into Blue's stomach. Blue
received a deep laceration wound but was not other-

Highway intersect at right angles with the
intersection controlled by a traffic signal.

One afternoon Dawn Doucette, a motorist, was
driving her car along Morris Avenue when she
struck Pasqual Pignatano, a bicyclist, who entered
the intersection from Kings Highway. Pignatano

Gersten Geiss, a native of Norway, emigrated to the
United States in 1918. Gersten eventually settled in
Topeka, Kansas where he married and raised a fam-
ily. For fifty years, Gersten ran a poultry business
in town. In 1964 Gersten took out a life insurance
policy with Prudential Insurance Company. Under
the terms of the policy, Gersten's wife, Genevieve,
was named as beneficiary. Gersten died in 2004.
When Genevieve filed a claim to recover the life
insurance proceeds, Prudential refused to disburse
the money claiming that Gersten had falsified his
birthdate on the insurance application.

38. Genevieve sued Prudential to recover the life
insurance proceeds. At trial the issue before
the court is Gersten's correct date of birth.

Question 40 is based on the following fact situation.

Post sued Dean for personal injury alleged to have
been caused by Dean's negligence. A major issue
at trial was whether Post's disability was caused
solely by trauma or by a preexisting condition
of osteoarthritis.

Post called Dr. Cox, who testified that the disability
was caused by trauma. On cross-examination, Dr.
Cox testified that a medical textbook entitled
Diseases of the Joints was authoritative and that
she agreed with the substance of passages from the
textbook that she was directed to look at, but that
the passages were inapplicable to Post's condition
because they dealt with rheumatoid arthritis rather
than with the osteoarthritis that Post was alleged
to have.

Dean then called his expert, Dr. Freed, who testi-
fied that, with reference to the issue being litigated,
there is no difference between the two kinds of
arthritis. Dean's counsel then asks permission to
read to the jury the textbook passages earlier shown
to Dr. Cox.

Oliver Oilman was arrested and charged with
murdering his wife, Olivia. During Oliver's trial,
the prosecution called Dr. Dorchester, a forensic
scientist, to testify that Oliver's deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) was present at the crime scene and on
the murder weapon. Dr. Dorchester testified that
the statistical probability based on DNA and
linking Oliver to the crime scene was one out of
12,300,000,000 people. Dr. Dorchester concluded
that it was statistically improbable that another
individual would have the same genetic match as
Oliver's. Dr. Dorchester further stated that he has
based his research on infor-mation contained in the
treatise entitled, The Science of DNA, written by
Barrister Sheck.

Oliver's attorney seeks to cross-examine Dr.
Dorchester regarding his testimony related to DNA.
During cross-examination, Oliver's attorney shows
Dr. Dorchester a photocopy of page 232 from

Question 42 is based on the following fact situation.

On March 1, Reed and the Sanford School entered
into a written contract providing that Reed would
be employed for one year in various capacities (ath-
letic director, teacher, football coach) in return for
an annual salary of $37,750. Shortly thereafter and
prior to the July commencement date of employ-
ment, Sanford elected to terminate its varsity foot-
ball program. The school publicly attributed the
decision to economic factors. Upon hearing this
news Reed sought out Mr. Bentley, headmaster of
the school, to inquire as to the effect, if any, of this
decision on his salary and responsibilities.

In order to resolve the matter, Mr. Bentley arranged
a meeting among various school officials to discuss
Reed's situation. Afterwards, the school sent written
notice to Reed of its intent to terminate his employ-
ment contract. Reed then commenced suit to
recover the full balance of his salary calculated on
the basis of the March 1 contract. At trial, Mr.
Bentley was called to testify. On direct examination
he testified that six people (including himself)
attended the meeting where it was decided to termi-
nate Reed's employment contract. When asked to
identify the attendees, Mr. Bentley gave the names
of four but despite trying was unable to remember
the name of the fifth person.

was struck by a motorboat operated by Collins.
Taylor, who was seriously injured in the accident,

Taylor was windsurfing.

At trial, Taylor calls Smithfield, an orthopedic
surgeon, to testify. Smithfield, who is an amateur
boating enthusiast, testified that he was navigating
his sailboat into Catalina Bay when Collins'
motorboat hit Taylor. Furthermore, Smithfield
testified that in the cockpit of his boat he maintains
a sophisticated electronic weathering device that
measures wind speed, temperature and barometric

Lansky was arrested and charged with arson which
in this jurisdiction is defined as the "malicious or
intentional burning of any structure or dwelling."
When Lansky was arrested, he was inside a ware-
house that was engulfed in flames. At the time he
was apprehended, the police found in his possession
a book of matches with four matches missing.

At trial, the prosecution introduced the book of
matches into evidence. Following closing argu-
ments and before the jury retired for deliberations,
the judge gave instructions concerning the law of
the case. The judge instructed the jury that it could
infer defendant's intent to set the fire based on the
fact that four matches were missing from the
matchbook. This instruction was specifically
objected to by the defense counsel.

Austin was arrested and charged with robbery.
Austin denies committing the crime and claims he
is the victim of mistaken identity. At the time of
Austin's arrest, he was unmarried but living with
his girlfriend, Ashley. While Austin was awaiting
trial, he married Ashley. During the robbery trial,
the prosecution called Ashley to testify. She is
asked to describe the clothing that Austin was wear-

criminal rape trial. The trial ended with a "hung
jury" as the jurors were unable to reach a unani-

prosecution indicated that it would seek to retry
Polanski on the criminal charge. In preparation for
the new trial, Bugliosi hired Clark, a non-lawyer
jury consultant, to interview Polanski and prepare
him for a possible second trial. Clark spent two
hours interviewing Polanski.

One week later, the prosecution filed the proper
notice of intent to retry Polanski and requested a
court order allowing the prosecution to depose
Clark regarding the substance of her interview with
the defendant. Bugliosi claimed the interview was
protected by the attorney-client privilege and filed a
motion to deny issuance of the requested discovery.

retrial the prosecution is barred from
introducing new statements made by the

Congress held hearings for several months to
investigate reports that agents for the federal Drug
Enforcement Agency had planted drug evidence to
falsely accuse citizens of engaging in illegal drug
activity and staged armed nighttime raids of the
homes of other citizens without probable cause. At
the close of the hearings, Congress passed a new
federal statute aimed at limiting the investigation
powers of the Drug Enforcement Agency.
Concerned that the statute might be attacked as
making it appear that Congress was "soft on
crime," Congress added a non-severable provision
to the statute granting standing to "anyone who
wishes to challenge" the statute and providing that
the suits
would be heard in the federal district courts.
Wilson, a citizen who supports law enforcement,
brought suit in federal district court to challenge

erable provision, the Newcastle Boating Act also
prohibited any person from selling at retail any new
or used boat that has not been inspected and
approved for safety by a licensed boating inspection
station in Newcastle prior to the time the vendor
delivers possession to the purchaser. Despite

In recent years, the city of Santa Ana has been
plagued by teenage gang violence. There have been
numerous incidents of sporadic shootings and stab-
bings involving gang members. Unfortunately, even
innocent bystanders have fallen victim to this gang
warfare. In an effort to alleviate the problem, the
city has opened a teenage discotheque where local
youths can mingle and dance while under adult
supervision. Only teenage boys and girls between
the ages of 13 to 19 are permitted to enter the club.

When the discotheque first opened, an unexpected
problem presented itself. There were a lot more
male teenagers frequenting the club than females.
This resulted in much harassment and fights which
only contributed to the girls staying away. In order
to try to correct this situation, the Santa Ana City
Council passed an ordinance that provided that any
male teenager desiring to enter the discotheque
must be accompanied by a female.

After this ordinance went into affect, Cody Cleaver,
an 18-year-old youth, was denied admission to the
discotheque because he came alone. He then filed
suit in federal court challenging the constitutional-

operators who lack the financial resources to
answer suit in every state where an Internet user
might be located. After the hearings had ended, the

President Reagan released three fellow Algerians
who were being held in prison in California. The
Algerians who were in prison had been prosecuted
and convicted in a California state court for kidnap-
ping. President Reagan realized that if the volley-
ball team was murdered it would destroy any
chance the United States had of winning a gold
medal in that competition. Under intense pressure
from the U.S. Olympic Committee, President
Reagan decided to make an exception to his inflexi-
ble stand on international terrorism. He issued a

ordered Governor Dukemejian to release them.
However, the governor refused to honor the
Presidential order.

The President has the constitutional
power to grant pardons or reprieves only
for offenses against the United States.
Under intergovernmental immunity, the

President Clinton was a longtime admirer of
Crispus Attucks, one of the five men killed in the
Boston Massacre. As his last official act as presi-
dent, Clinton issued an executive order making
January 2nd, Crispus Attucks' birthday, as a paid
national holiday for federal executive employees.

Congressional legislation currently in effect desig-
nates ten paid national holidays for federal em-
ployees. The applicable federal law neither
authorizes nor prohibits the president's action.
Clinton's executive order extends only to members
of the executive branch of the federal government.

Faith Hall is a recent Harvard Law School graduate

Scalia as a law clerk. Faith is upset because she is
required to work on January 2nd and President
Clinton's order does not extend to federal judicial
employees. Faith brings suit in federal court chal-
lenging the validity of the executive order.

The President was concerned about a possible trade
embargo imposed on U.S. exports to the country of
Blekarne because U.S. manufacturers operating in
Blekarne were paying wages to Blekarne workers at
a rate substantially lower than those paid to U.S.
workers performing comparable work. In order to
avoid this problem, the President entered into an
executive agreement with the leader of Blekarne
requiring that any U.S. based company employing
workers in Blekarne must pay those workers no
less than 80 percent as much as any U.S. worker
employed by the company in the U.S. performing
a similar function. Several U.S. manufacturers
complained that this would place them at a gross
disadvantage compared to non-U.S. based compa-

The Florida legislature has passed a law banning
the sale of phen fen, a popular weight loss pill,
within the state due to widespread reports that
the drug caused users to suffer cardiac arrest. The
Florida statute prohibited the sale and distribution
of phen fen either by prescription or by over-the-
counter sales. Violation of the statute was pro-
scribed to be a misdemeanor punishable by a
$1,000 fine.

After the Florida law was enacted, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), a federal agency,
issued an administrative order allowing the sale of
phen fen by prescription only.

Eli Einhorn is a registered pharmacist who owns
and operates a pharmacy in Miami Beach. Sophie
Sadler, a Miami Beach resident, was given a
prescription for phen fen by her physician. She
presented the prescription to Eli who dispensed
phen fen to her. Thereafter, Eli was charged with
violating the Florida statute prohibiting the sale of
phen fen.

12. As Eli awaited trial, his attorney filed suit

challenging the constitutionality of the Florida
statute. The court will likely hold that the
statute is

(A) valid, because the state law was enacted

(C)

prior to the administrative order
(B) valid, because a state law takes prece-
dence over a conflicting administrative
order
invalid, because an administrative order
of a federal agency supersedes a con-
flicting state law
invalid, because the FDA has plenary
power to regulate the sale and distribu-
tion of drugs within the United States

The state of Oklahoma has passed a law requiring
all commercial restaurants to cook their beef and
hamburger meat at a minimum temperature of 165
degrees Fahrenheit. This law which became known
as the "E. Coli Prevention Act" went into effect
January 1, 2004. According to an inseverable provi-
sion of the law, Oklahoma health inspectors were
empowered to levy fines and/or revoke the business
permits of any restaurant failing to comply with the
health measure. The state legislature enacted this
law in order to ensure that beef was properly
cooked to kill the E. Coli bacteria. An E. Coli
bacteria epidemic has spread across Oklahoma
and various sections of the United States resulting
in many deaths to infant children. Health
authorities have attributed the E. Coli epidemic
to under-cooked beef mostly from fast food
restaurant chains.

In 2001, Congress passed a similar bill requiring all
commercial restaurants to cook their beef at a mini-
mum temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit. After
the Oklahoma law went into effect, a state health
inspector determined that Burp's Burger King
restaurant in Tulsa was cooking its beef at 155
degrees Fahrenheit. As a consequence, the
Oklahoma State Health Department moved to
revoke Burp's business license as per the provision
in the "E. Coli Prevention Act."

13. If Burp's Burger King brings suit to attack the
constitutionality of the Oklahoma "E. Coli
Prevention Act", the state law will likely be
held

(A) valid, as a reasonable exercise of the

Question 16 is based on the following fact situation.

The U.S. Department of the Interior granted Reeves
a food and drink concession in a federal park
located in the State of Cumberland. Reeves oper-
ated this concession for his own profit. The conces-
sion was operated in federally-owned facilities, for
which Reeves paid rent, and served visiting tourists
from all over the country.

The legislature of the State of Cumberland, in an
effort to equalize state tax burdens, passed a law
imposing a rental use tax on all persons occupying
real property in Cumberland for which no state real
property taxes are paid. Pursuant to the new law,
the Cumberland Department of Revenue attempted
to collect the state rental use tax from Reeves,
based on the estimated fair market rental value of
the federal facilities housing his operation. Reeves
sued in federal district court to invalidate the state
rental use tax as applied to him.

15. The District Court should hold that the state

rental use tax in this instance is

(A) valid, because federal property used for
proprietary purposes is not immune
from nondiscriminatory state taxation
(B) valid, provided the tax does not discrimi-

In order to resolve a longstanding territorial dispute
with the Poco Indians, Congress enacted a statute
conveying 1,000 acres of federal land in southeast
Idaho to the Indian tribe. The statute provided that
the land in question would be sold to the Poco tribe
for the price of $1.00. After enactment of this
statute was made public, many other Indian tribes
protested the government's action. In particular, the
Aloquonquin Indian tribe, who claimed title to a
large tract of federal land in northern Michigan,
was angered because no similar land conveyance
was made to them.

16. The Aloquonquin Indian tribe brought suit in
an appropriate federal district court challeng-
ing the constitutionality of this federal statute.
Assuming that the Aloquonquin tribe has ade-
quate standing, which of the following state-
ments concerning this suit is most accurate?

(A) The court should treat the action of

Congress as presumptively valid because
the Constitution expressly gives
Congress power to dispose of the terri-
tory or other property belonging to the
United States.

(B) The court should treat the action of

Congress as presumptively invalid
because $1.00 consideration is wholly
inadequate to compensate the govern-
ment for the conveyance of such a large
tract of land.

(C) The court should hold this statute to be

constitutional only if substantial evi-
dence demonstrates that the Poco Indian
tribe did, in fact, have a valid claim to
the land in question.

(D) The court should hold this statute to be
unconstitutional because it denies other
Indian tribes the equal protection of the

Question 18 is based on the following fact situation.

The state of Midwest recently enacted legislation
authorizing the state's tax collection agency to issue
refunds of state tax payments in the form of
"Midwest Bucks." Midwest Bucks are vouchers
good for the purchase of various consumer goods at
special state retail outlets. In practice, one Midwest
Buck is slightly greater in buying power than one
dollar, since the special state retail stores are
exempted from paying state retail sales tax. A sig-
nificant commerce in Midwest Bucks has sprung
up independent of the state retail stores, since many
people are willing to accept Midwest Bucks in
exchange for services or property knowing that they
can use them to purchase goods at the state stores.
The United States government has instituted an
action in federal court to declare the Midwest
Bucks legislation unconstitutional.

17. Which of the following is the strongest argu-

ment supporting a judicial declaration that the
challenged statute is unconstitutional?

(A) The statute unduly burdens commerce.
(B) The statute violates the Privileges and
Immunities Clause of Article IV.

(C) The statute is inconsistent with the

express power of the federal government
to coin money and regulate its value.

(D) The authority to tax, and the concomi-

tant authority to issue tax refunds in any
legitimate manner, is inherent in the
powers reserved to the states by the
Tenth Amendment.

A state university adopts a policy prohibiting the
admission of any student who is a citizen of a
country in which United States citizens have been
held as hostages in the last five years. Fouad is
denied admission to the university because he is a

are being held hostage.

18. Which of the following is the strongest argu-

of this policy?

The state university policy conflicts with
the negative implications flowing from
the federal government's authority over
foreign relations.
Denial of admission to these foreigners
for such past actions of their govern-
ments is an ex post facto law.
Admission to a university is so impor-
tant to a person's economic prospects
that it is considered a property interest
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Admission to a state university is a priv-

Question 19 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 20 is based on the following fact situation.

In September, Hurricane Helga struck the Florida
coast with devastating force. Helga was a grade 5
hurricane and caused over $100,000,000 in dam-
ages. Florida farmers were especially hit hard by
the hurricane which destroyed over 30% of the
state's citrus crops. As a consequence, Congress
passed an emergency farm aid bill providing
$50,000,000 in subsidies to Florida orange growers
to compensate them for their economic losses.

Clearly, Florida's economy is very much dependent
upon the orange industry, which is its largest staple
crop. The federal farm aid bill, however, did not
provide any compensation to Florida farmers grow-
ing crops other than oranges.

19. Pappas is a Florida papaya farmer who suf-

fered substantial economic loss when his
entire crop was destroyed by Hurricane Helga.
Pappas challenges the constitutionality of the
aforementioned federal law. Is this act of
Congress constitutional?

Yes, because Congress has exclusive
jurisdiction as to the propriety of dis-
persing federal funds which is not sub-
ject to judicial review.
Yes, because Congress has the power to
appropriate funds for the general welfare
even though disparate treatment is given
to different groups.
No, because the law violates the equal
protection rights of farmers of products
other than oranges who are not entitled
to governmental subsidies.
No, because the law denies farmers of
products other than oranges their funda-
mental rights without due process.

Congress was concerned about the privacy of
Internet communication and banking transactions
conducted at automated teller machines (ATMs). In
order to increase the protections afforded these
electronic transactions and communications,
Congress passed the Cyberspace Privacy Act
(CPA). Under the CPA, all encryption technology
(encryption is the process by which a computer pro-
gram changes readable text information into an
unreadable algorithm or mathematical equation)
used to secure Internet and ATM transactions was
subject to federal regulation. The CPA strictly regu-
lated the development, use and sale of all encryp-
tion software.

One provision of the CPA expressly empowered the
Office of Defense Trade Controls (ODTC), a fed-
eral agency, to regulate the import and export of all
encryption technology with foreign countries.
Accordingly, the ODTC was given authority to pro-
hibit the export of any encryption system of soft-
ware if, in the judgment of the ODTC, the export
would threaten national security or other foreign
policy interests.

Professor Gates, a recognized expert on
Management Information Systems (MIS), has
developed an encryption software program that he
was negotiating to sell to a company in France. The
ODTC has refused to issue an authorization approv-
ing the sale of Professor Gates' encryption software
to the French company.

20. Professor Gates filed suit in federal district
court challenging the constitutionality of the
Cyberspace Privacy Act. The legislation is

(A)

(B)

constitutional, under the Commerce
Clause
constitutional, because Congress has the
power to regulate for the general welfare

(C) unconstitutional, because it deprives

Professor Gates of a property right with-
out just compensation

(D) unconstitutional, because it usurps the

Question 21 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 22 is based on the following fact situation.

Congress was very concerned about the rise in gun-
related deaths and injuries that had been occurring
in the schools. To combat the problem, Congress
passed a statute which required the states to enact
legislation that made it a crime to sell, possess, or
transport any firearm within 100 yards of any
school if that firearm had been purchased or sold
through or using any instrumentality of interstate
commerce.

21. Is the statute constitutional?

(A) Yes, because the statute will permit a

case-by-case review of the adequacy of
an interstate commerce connection
between the permissible objectives of
the federal statute and any individual
criminal prosecution.

(B) Yes, because the statute is a proper

attempt to regulate interstate commerce
in its inseverable aggregates.

(C) No, under the separation of powers doc-
trine, Congress cannot commandeer the
states to enact and enforce legislation.
(D) No, the connection between interstate

commerce and the purpose of the regu-
lation is too remote to justify the exer-
cise of the Commerce Clause power.

The state of North Durango enacted a statute
prohibiting any motor vehicles traveling within the
state to have Windowtinting or glass coating of any
kind. The bill, known as the "Window Tint" Act,
passed the state legislature at the urging of state and
local law enforcement agencies who argued that
tinted windows prevented them from observing
interior car activity. Most citizens also supported
the "Window Tint" Act, especially after a North
Durango state trooper was gunned down and killed
by an occupant in a window tinted limousine. The
trooper was unable to see that his assailant was
armed and dangerous when he approached the
vehicle for a speeding infraction.

Luxury Limousine Company operates a limo
service in the neighboring state of South Durango.
Luxury has a fleet of 68 limos all of which have
tinted windows. Each year Luxury makes thousands
of trips into North Durango to transport passengers
to Durango International Airport (situated ten miles
from the South Durango border) and other destina-
tions. Since all its limos are manufactured with
tinted windows, Luxury will incur a great expense
to specially order limos without tinting.

22. Luxury brings suit to challenge the constitu-

tionality of the North Durango "Window Tint"
Act. Assuming that Luxury has proper stand-
ing to assert such an action, which of the
following is Luxury's strongest constitutional
argument to invalidate the aforesaid statute?

(A) Because window tinting is permitted on

vehicles in neighboring states, this law
denies Luxury the equal protection of
laws whenever its limos operate within
North Durango.

(B) Because this law burdens interstate com-

merce by prohibiting all vehicles with
window tinting from entering the state,
this law violates the Commerce Clause.
(C) Because window tinting on vehicles is

legal in South Durango but illegal in
North Durango, this law violates the
Contract Clause by preventing Luxury
from fulfilling its obligation to transport
passengers into North Durango.

(D) Because interstate travel is a fundamental

right that may not be burdened by state
law, it violates Luxury's substantive due
process rights by arbitrarily and unrea-
sonably regulating economic activity.

The state of Rutherford is known for its coal pro-
duction. The neighboring state of Chippewa also
contains large coal deposits. Chippewa's main coal
mining company, however, is in poor financial
shape, and there are rumors in the industry that it
may cease doing business and sell a large quantity
of coal at bargain prices.

Fearful of an impending glut on the market and the
consequent effect on the local coal industry, the
Rutherford state legislature enacts a law which pro-
hibits sales of coal within the Rutherford state
boundaries at less than $25/ton, which is the cur-
rent market price.

23. This law is most likely to be held constitu-
tional as applied to which of the following
coal vendors?

A Chippewa vendor offering coal for
sale to the general public in the state of
Rutherford at $20/ton.
A Rutherford vendor offering coal for
sale to the U.S. Veteran's Hospital in
Rutherford at $20/ton.
A Rutherford vendor offering coal for
sale to a manufacturing plant in
Rutherford at $20/ton.
A vendor located outside of the United
States offering coal for sale to the gen-
eral public in the state of Rutherford for

Tish, an avid sports fan, lived in Honolulu.
Recently, Select Television, a privately owned and
operated company, applied for a permit to provide
cable television service to residents of the city. By a
vote of 9 to 3, the Honolulu City Council approved
Select Television's application and granted a permit
for a city franchise. Thereafter, Tish subscribed
with Select which then installed cable service to
Tish's home. Tish subscribed with Select because it
offered a wide range of sports programs from all
across the country.

Select installed cable service at Tish's home in
February. For the next four months, Tish promptly
paid the $25 monthly charge for the cable service.
In July, however, Tish was fired from his job as a
sushi chef at Benihana Restaurant. Unable to find
any work and short of cash, Tish failed to pay
Select's bill for the months of July and August.

On August 31, Select removed its cable television
lines to Tish's home. At no time did Select notify
Tish that it would be disconnecting service.
However, unknown to Tish it was Select's policy to
terminate service to any customer who failed to pay
his or her bill for two consecutive months.

A short time later, Tish brought suit against Select
in federal court seeking an order restoring his cable
service. Tish's suit was based solely on the ground
that Select's failure to grant Tish a hearing before
disconnecting his cable service violated his due
process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.

24. Based on the given facts, the federal court

should rule in favor of

(B)

(A) Select, because the ownership of a city
franchise is not sufficient state action to
make the franchisee subject to the
Fourteenth Amendment
Select, because the ownership of a city
franchise allows the franchisee to assert
successfully the city's sovereign immu-
nity under the Eleventh Amendment
(C) Tish, because under the Fourteenth

Amendment a person may not be
deprived of a valuable property right
without notice or an opportunity for a
hearing

(D) Tish, because a business operating under
a city franchise is effectively within the
public interest, and therefore it is subject
to constitutional requirements of proce-

Paul recently left his job in Wildwood, a rural
community in the State of Calzona, and moved his
family to Industria in search of new career opportu-
nities there. Industria is located in an urbanized
metropolitan area of Calzona which has been expe-
riencing tremendous employment and residential
growth of late. When Paul informed his insurance
carrier, Good Neighbor Insurance Company, of the
change of residence, he was notified that his auto
and home insurance rates would increase by 300
percent due to the large number of traffic accidents
and theft claims occurring in Industria. The insur-
ance industry is highly regulated by Calzona law,
including the licensing and solvency of all insur-
ance companies operating within the state. There
are no state laws regulating the rates for insurance
practices of the companies.

25. If Paul brings suit in a Calzona state court

claiming the rate increase is discriminatory in

the court rules against him, the most likely
reason will be because

(A)

State of Watusi, concerned with increasing the
quality of care to its senior citizens, passes a bill
providing that on or after January 1, 2007, only

ing clinic, brings suit challenging the grandfa-
ther clause exemption in the new statute. The
exemption in the law for all currently regis-

found to be

constitutional, because the classification
between existing and new vendors has a
rational basis
constitutional, because those who law-
fully engage in an occupation have a
fundamental right to continue to do so

Victoria, Palumbo filed a building permit with the

The Commonwealth of Islandia has enacted an
abortion statute in an attempt to reconcile the
conflicting interests involved when a woman
chooses to terminate a pregnancy by abortion.
The Islandia statute provided that during the first
three months of pregnancy, a woman's right to
choose to terminate the pregnancy was paramount
and could not be restricted in any manner. After the
first three months, the right of a woman to obtain
an abortion was limited to cases where it was
demonstrated by a physician that an abortion was
necessary to protect the life or health of the woman
seeking the abortion.

30. In all likelihood this abortion statute is

statute strikes a proper balance between
the fundamental right of a woman to
choose to terminate a pregnancy by
abortion and the due process right to life
of the unborn child.

statute is substantially related to the
important state interest in protecting the

Milltown is a suburb of rapidly expanding Silicon
City. While Milltown used to be a sleepy little vil-
lage, it has doubled in size in the last decade. The
Milltown police force has noted a dramatic increase
in crime, and the public schools are having diffi-
culty keeping pace with increasing enrollments.

Last April, Milltown adopted a zoning ordinance by
referendum, providing that in order to prevent dan-
gerous overcrowding, the upscale westside neigh-
borhood known as "Snob Hill" will be limited to
single-family homes which may be occupied by
only one "family unit." A family unit is defined in
the ordinance as one or two parents plus their
unmarried children.

Elsa is a widow, and has lived in the Snob Hill
neighborhood for 52 years. Because her health is
deteriorating, she wrote to her nephew Richard and
invited him to come live with her. Elsa promised
Richard that if he would stay with and take care of
her, she would leave the house to him in her will. In
reliance on that promise, Richard left his residence
in Obregon, a neighboring state, and moved into
Elsa's house.

Elsa received a notice from the city that she was in
violation of the new zoning ordinance because she
and Richard do not constitute a "family unit" as
defined by the ordinance. Elsa filed suit in federal
court to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance
against her.

29. Based on U.S. Supreme Court decisions, the

strongest constitutional argument Elsa can
make against application of the ordinance to
her is that the ordinance

(A)

Impairs the obligation of Elsa's contract
with Richard.

(B) Denies her a privilege or immunity

protected by Article IV.

(C) Would unduly burden interstate

Medford's employees were not residents of the city
but instead commuted to work in Medford from
their homes in the suburbs. Concerned that these
suburban employees were not spending enough
money earned in Medford to support the local mer-
chants, a commuter employment tax was enacted by
the city council. The tax was set at a rate of 5 per-
cent of all income earned by persons who were
employed in Medford but were not also residents of
the city. Austin, a resident of nearby Deerfield who
worked in Medford, brought an action challenging
the constitutionality of the employment tax.

34. The court should rule that the tax is

Question 35 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 36 is based on the following fact situation.

Fishman entered into a franchise contract with
Samurai Sushi, Inc. to operate a Samurai Sushi
fast-food restaurant in Carson City, Nevada.
Samurai Sushi, Inc.'s national headquarters is
located in San Pedro, California. After the Fishman-
Samurai Sushi contract was executed, Fishman
leased a store in a shopping mall where he planned
to open his sushi restaurant. Carson City public
officials, however, refused to grant Fishman the
necessary food vendor's license despite the fact that
he can prove that his restaurant complies with all
provisions of the municipal licensing ordinance.
Section 1287 of the Carson City Food Vending
Ordinance provides, in part, that "a food vendor's
license shall be issued to any applicant who prop-
erly complies with all of the health requirements of
this ordinance." After Fishman's application for a
food vendor's license was rejected, he requested a
hearing to establish his qualifications. Carson City
officials refused this request and also declined to
give any reason for his license denial.

35. Which of the following is the strongest consti-
tutional argument that Fishman may use to
challenge the refusal of Carson City officials
to grant him a food vendor's license?

(A) The Carson City action denies him

procedural due process.

(B) The Carson City action denies him

substantive due process by arbitrarily
regulating economic activity.

(C) The Carson City action constitutes an

undue burden on the potential interstate
commerce between Fishman and his
out-of-state franchisor.

(D) The Carson City action impairs the

obligation of Fishman's contract with the
franchising company and his rental
agreement with the shopping mall.

In an effort to attract a major league baseball team
to the City of New Orleans, the City Council, with
the approval of the state legislature, passed the
Ballpark Financing and Revenue Act of 2006
("Ballpark Act") to authorize and require the Mayor
and the Sports Commission to acquire land at a
designated area and to develop and construct a ball-
park. The Ballpark Act incorporated an express
finding that the construction of a baseball park was
a municipal use for the citizens of the City of New
Orleans.

In 2007, a group of owners of property in the pri-
mary ballpark site filed suit in an appropriate state
court seeking to enjoin the City from proceeding
with plans to acquire land on that site, including the
use of eminent domain to acquire the said property.

The property owner's principal argument is that the
taking of their land would violate the Public Use
Clause of the Fifth Amendment, even if they are
paid a fair price for their loss.

36. Based on Supreme Court precedent, who has
the burden of persuasion and what is the
appropriate standard whether property taken
by the government satisfies the public use
requirement?

(A) The City must prove by compelling rea-
sons that the property taken is for a
legitimate public use because property
ownership is a fundamental constitu-
tional right.

(B) The City must prove the public use sat-

isfies an important governmental pur-
pose unrelated to the achievement of
other goals.

(C) The City must prove that its exercise of
eminent domain is rationally related to a
conceivable public purpose.

(D) The property owners must prove that

taking of their land is not necessary and
does not serve a legitimate governmental
interest.

The legislature of State Z is engaged in debates in
the question of regulating acupuncturists. Chester, a
well respected practitioner of this specialty, became
enraged during the heated debate and in a sponta-
neous outburst, shouted from the balcony that all
the legislators in favor of new extremely rigorous
licensing requirements for acupuncturists are "pen-
cil-necked, spineless jerks who could use a needle
up their buns." The legislators promptly acted in a
display of their power to adopt a rigorous licensing
law with a special provision revoking Chester's
license to practice as an acupuncturist.

37. When Chester challenges the revocation of his
license, what is the most likely result?

(A) This is an invalid action in violation of
his privileges and immunities under
Article IV, Section 2.

(B) This is invalid because it deprives him

of the right to engage in gainful employ-
ment.

(C) This is a bill of attainder and therefore

invalid.

(D) This is valid because a license is only a

privilege and thus there is no right to
procedural due process.

Capano was charged with robbery. The crime took
place on February 1. At the time the crime
occurred, this jurisdiction required a unanimous

The state of Kiwi enacted a statute requiring that
the state motto, "Live Free or Die" be prominently
displayed on all state license plates. Cherimoya, a
resident of Kiwi who considered the motto to be
personally offensive, covered the motto portion of
her license with a piece of tape. Although she left
the license plate in a condition that served its auto

The city of Gotham has an ordinance which allows
non-governmental organizations and businesses to

Question 42 is based on the following fact situation.

In Branzburg v. Hayes,  409 U.S. 665 (1972), the
United States Supreme Court by a 5 to 4 majority
rejected a reporter's claim that, as the flow of infor-
mation available to the press would be impeded if
newspersons were compelled to release the names
of confidential sources for use in a government
investigation, the First Amendment must be held to
embrace a privilege to constitutionally refuse to
divulge such information in order to protect the
reporter's channels to the community.

In the wake of Branzburg, however, several states
have enacted "state shield" laws which provide a
varying range of protection for newspersons. Now,
Congress—under intense lobbying pressure from
the press—proposes to enact legislation forbidding
any state from requiring journalists to reveal the
sources of their news articles in civil suits.

41. Which of the following is the strongest consti-

tutional argument in support of this proposed
law?

Congress has the authority under the
Commerce Clause to regulate the flow
of news.
Acts of Congress are the supreme law of
the land and take precedence over any
conflicting state laws.
Congress is essentially reaffirming the
free speech guarantees of the First and
Fourteenth Amendments.
Under Article 1, Section 8, Congress has
the authority to secure to authors and
inventors the exclusive right to their
respective writings and discoveries.

Notre Dame University is located in the city of
South Bend, Indiana. For many years, residents
have complained to local officials about the boister-
ous noise and senseless shouting among students
before and after Notre Dame football games. In
response to these complaints, the South Bend City
Council enacted an "anti-noise" ordinance prohibit-
ing the singing and chanting of songs from 1:00
p.m. to 1:00 a.m. by two or more persons, if such
noise is audible off the premises where the singing
takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted
from its purview the singing or chanting of reli-
gious songs.

After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect,
Notre Dame played an important football game
against University of Southern California for the
national championship. The game, which was played
in South Bend, was won by the Irish. Following the
game, a large group of Notre Dame students were
walking down Main Street on their way to a victory
celebration. They began loudly chanting, "We're
number 1...we're number 1." One of the residents
who lived on Main Street was greatly disturbed by
the noise. As a result, he reported the incident to
the police who were immediately summoned to the
scene. The students who engaged in the chanting
were arrested and charged with violating the South
Bend "anti-noise" ordinance.

42. The students who were prosecuted now bring

suit challenging the constitutionality of the
South Bend ordinance. Which of the follow-
ing would constitute their WEAKEST argu-
ment against enforcement of the "anti-noise"
statute?

The ordinance deprives persons of their
freedom of expression in violation of the
First and Fourteenth Amendments.
The ordinance deprives persons of their
liberty without due process of law
because the ordinance is not related to
any legitimate community interest.
The statutory language of the ordinance
is vague and overbroad since it attempts
to encompass all forms of singing.
The ordinance deprives the persons of
the equal protection of the laws by
impermissibly distinguishing between
religiously inspired singing and all other
forms of singing.

Question 44 is based on the following fact situation.

The Lucifers are a religious group which claims
that its principles are derived from those of the
ancient Druids. As a part of their annual Summer
Solstice ceremony, the Lucifers gather on the high-
est mountaintop in the vicinity for a day of prayer
and chanting. The ceremony culminates in an
evening bonfire in which the Lucifers believe the
sins of the world are expunged. The Lucifers
applied for a permit to hold their annual ceremony
on top of Mt. Snow, in a federal park. The Chief
Ranger denied the permit, citing the serious fire
risk posed by the bonfire. A federal regulation per-
mits the appropriate federal official to deny such
permits if the official has reason to believe that any
person or group could cause any environmental
harm to the federal park. However, the Chief
Ranger had been quoted in the local newspaper
making various derogatory remarks about cults, and
had denied day-use permits to other unorthodox
groups in the past.

The state of Althea passed the "Bare Bottoms"
statute prohibiting bottomless dancing in establish-
ments licensed to serve liquor. The legislature
found that the law was necessary to restrict "adult"
speech because licensed liquor establishments were
promoting lewd behavior between customers and
women entertainers. Moreover, the legislature cited
widespread reports that female dancers were
involved in prostitution in and around the licensed
premises and both rape and attempted rape took
place "on or immediately adjacent to such
premises."

Larry "Skin" Flint owned and operated the "Tuchas
Club" which was located in the state of Althea. The
club was licensed to sell liquor and featured bot-
tomless female entertainers. After the law went into
effect, the state attorney general notified Larry that
unless he banned bottomless dancing at his club,
the state would revoke his license to sell liquor.

43. What result is most likely, when the Lucifers
challenge the Chief Ranger's denial of a per-
mit?

44. Larry has filed suit in federal district court

challenging the constitutionality of the Althea
"Bare Bottoms" statute. The court should rule

Denial upheld; allowing the religious
ceremony on federal land would violate

Denial upheld; this is a valid time, place

Question 46 is based on the following fact situation.

State Red is concerned with the increase in teenage
use of cigarettes, chewing tobacco, cigars and other
tobacco products. In an effort to decrease exposure
to these items which pose harmful health risks, the
state legislature has enacted a statute to restrict var-
ious methods of advertising by tobacco manufactur-
ers. One of the provisions of the law states that
"advertising of tobacco prices is not permitted
except by placement of a sticker on the package or
box itself" Chesterfield Tobacco Company, a major
distributor of such products in State Red, claims the
advertising restriction violates its constitutional
rights protected by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments.

46. If Chesterfield Tobacco Company files suit

challenging the validity of the State Red
statute, the court should rule the statute

constitutional, because the state law is
rationally related to the health and safety
of Red citizens
constitutional, because the restriction on
commercial speech directly advances a
substantial government interest
unconstitutional, because the regulation
on commercial speech is not necessary
to further an important government
interest

Grass Valley is the capitol of the small, rural State
of Dichondra. Grass Valley was settled in the early
1800's by a religious sect seeking a quiet atmos-
phere in which to practice their beliefs and raise
their children. The population of Grass Valley
still consists largely of descendants of these early
settlers, and the social and political views of the
residents are generally quite conservative.

Last year, Travers opened an "adult theater" in
Grass Valley. The films shown in the theater contain
a great deal of explicit sexual material, and very
little plot. Travers was charged with violation of the
Dichondra obscenity law, which prohibits "material
whose dominant theme is appeal to prurient sexual
interests, is patently offensive and lacks serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific merit."

In his own defense, Travers claimed that he granted
admission to adults only, and that the films which
he showed had been found not to be obscene in
other states. At trial, however, Travers was con-
victed based on overwhelming evidence that the
material was considered obscene by the majority
of citizens in Grass Valley. On appeal, Travers
challenges the state obscenity law on the grounds
that it is unconstitutional.

45. Will the court agree that the statute is uncon-

stitutional as applied to Travers?

(A) Yes, because the First and Fourteenth
Amendments provide for the exercise
of individual free choice with respect
to films as well as other forms of
expression.

(B) Yes, because this statute violates the

fundamental right of consenting adults
to watch what they please in private.

(C) No, because states may use their police
powers to prohibit the showing of hard-
core pornography in a public theater.

(D) No, because states may use local

standards to determine whether a film
is patently offensive.

Question 48 is based on the following fact situation.

The Last Chance Church is organized as a religious
corporation. All of its property is owned by a group
of trustees who reside in the state of Utopia. As a
part of the practice of their religious beliefs, a cow
is required to be sacrificed. After the ceremonial
slaughter, the worshippers drink the cow's blood in
a symbolic ritual designed to cleanse their bodies of
sin. The trustees of the church have recently taken
action to have the cow slaughter ritual discontinued,
claiming that it was not a fundamental tenet of the
church's religion.

A group of church members, who also reside in
Utopia, subsequently brought suit in an appropriate
state court to oust the trustees of the church and
replace them with persons who will permit the
sacrificial ritual. Plaintiffs alleged that the cow
sacrifice is a fundamental tenet of the church's
religious rites.

47. As a matter of constitutional law, may the

state court properly adjudicate this suit on the
merits?

Yes, because there is clearly a case or
controversy between the plaintiffs and
trustees.
Yes, because the plaintiffs have standing
since they will suffer direct injury from
the trustees' proposed action.
No, because there is no diversity of citi-
zenship between the plaintiffs and the
trustees.
No, because a court decision on the
merits of the case would violate the free
exercise of religion.

Paul applied to the State Department of Motor
Vehicles (DMV) for a driver's license which was
denied by the Department because he refused to
include on the application his social security num-
ber as required by the Vehicle Code. Paul seeks an
exemption from the social security disclosure on
the ground that such regulation violates his free
exercise rights under the First Amendment.
Specifically, Paul claims that the use of such num-
bers for any other purpose than the administration
of social security would "endanger his chances of
being chosen for life after death." The primary
source of Paul's beliefs is predicated on The New
Testament, Book of Revelations, Chapter 13.

After being denied an exemption by the DMV, Paul
files a suit against the Administrator of the
Department of Motor Vehicles in an appropriate
state court alleging an infringement of his free exer-
cise rights. The state trial court conducted an exten-
sive hearing and concluded inter alia, that Paul's
beliefs were religious in nature, and sincerely held.
Nevertheless, the trial court denied Paul's petition.

48. On appeal, the state appellate court should,

applying the appropriate U.S. Supreme Court
precedent, rule that the DMV regulation is

(B)

it has a compelling reason for promoting

safety.
constitutional, because the DMV regula-
tion is a neutral law of general applica-
tion and is rationally related to
promoting a legitimate state interest.

(C) unconstitutional, if the appellate court
concludes that the sincere religious
beliefs of Paul clearly outweigh the
state's interest in promoting highway
safety.

Question 50 is based on the following fact situation.

Voters in New Orleans passed a referendum
legalizing gambling in the French Quarter section
of the city. The law established a Gambling
Commission (consisting of five individuals)
that was in charge of licensing and overseeing the
activities of the casinos. The members of the
Gambling Commission were to be appointed by
the Mayor. Pursuant to his statutory power, the
Mayor appointed four private citizens and a clergy
member to the commission.

50. There is a constitutional challenge to the

appointment of the clergy member as violat-
ing the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment. The Mayor's action is

unconstitutional, because the appoint-
ment of a clergy member to the commis-
sion fosters excessive governmental
entanglement with religion
unconstitutional on its face, if members
of the commission are vested with
enforcement powers

The Independence City School Board often permit-

at high school buildings after school hours. The
Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, a local religious group,
submitted a request to use an Independence public
high school building to conduct a meeting after reg-
ular school hours from 7:00pm to 9:00pm. The
school board denied the request claiming that
allowing the religious group to use the school prop-
erty would violate the Establishment Clause.

The Jimmy Swaggart Ministries filed suit in state
court asserting that the school board's action vio-
lated their organization's rights of equal protection
and freedom of speech. In addition, the religious
group argued that conducting a meeting in a school
building after regular school hours did not violate
the Establishment Clause inasmuch as other non-

(A) valid, because allowing equal access to

(C)	
A person is subject to liability for battery if he or she acts intending to cause  a harm-
ful or offensive contact with the person of the other and an offensive or harmful contact
directly or indirectly results. An act which is not done with such an intention does not make
the actor liable for mere offensive contact. Since Keiki vomited involuntarily, she would lack
the requisite intent to be liable for tortious battery.

(D)	
According to Restatement of Torts 2d,  Section 50, taking part in a game manifests a
willingness to submit to such bodily contacts that are permitted by its rules or usages.
Participating in such a game does not manifest consent to contacts which are prohibited by the
rules of the games. MBE Exam Tip: This is true even though the player knows that those with
or against whom he is playing are habitual violators of such rules. As such, choice (D) is cor-
rect.

(B)	
Note that choice (A) is wrong because in order to be liable for battery the defendant
must act intending  to cause a harmful or offensive contact. Here, Barkley did not act intend-
ing to strike Mrs. Mertz. Therefore, Barkley is not liable for tortious battery. With respect to
choice (C), this is a classic Multistate play on words. Students must be able to distinguish
between accidental and negligent conduct. In this regard, it is possible to act accidentally but
still be negligent or careless. Furthermore, choice (D) is wrong because self-defense is not a
defense for negligence. Thus, choice (B) is correct by process of elimination.

(B)	
A similar Torts issue was presented on last summer's MBE exam. Obviously, this
is an extremely difficult problem because choices (A), (B) and (C) are all arguably correct.
However, alternative (B) is the best answer because when Bates threw the rock and hit the
car, he committed a battery. Remember that protection against unpermitted contacts
extends to any part of the body, or to anything which is attached to it and practically
identified with it.  Thus, Prosser states that "contact with the plaintiff's clothing, or with a
cane, a paper, or any object held in his hand will be sufficient; and the same is true of the
chair in which he sits, the horse or the car which he is riding or driving,"  Law of Torts,
pg. 34. Note that choice (C) is incorrect because according to  Restatement of Torts, 2d,
Section 17, where A is trespassing on C's land and C throws a stone at A, C is subject to
liability when the stone strikes A. See Illustration 3, pg 29. Finally, Bates is also liable for
assault because the facts indicate that Asher was frightened and momentarily lost control
of the vehicle.

(B)	
This is a very "tricky" Multistate question that must be answered by process of elim-
ination. Choice (C) is wrong because Pauline apparently consented to the sexual encounter
with Don. Thus, consent would be a valid defense for the intentional tort of battery. Choice
(D) is incorrect because invasion of right to privacy covers (1) appropriation, (2) false light,
(3) public disclosure of private facts and (4) intrusions on one's seclusion or solitude. A con-
sensual sexual relationship would not result in an invasion of right to privacy. As between
choices (A) and (B), (B) is preferred because  the extreme and outrageous nature of conduct
may arise from the abuse by the defendant of a relation or position which gives the defen-
In particular police officers, school author-
dant actual or apparent authority over the victim. 
ities, landlords, and collecting creditors have been held liable for extreme abuse of their
position. Note that choice (A) is less preferred because in order to recover for negligent
infliction of emotional distress the plaintiff must suffer bodily harm or injury.  Here, the
facts state that Pauline suffered emotional distress but not bodily harm or injury.

One of the most popular Multistate testing areas deals with suits brought by third par-
(C)	
ties for intentional (or reckless) infliction of emotional distress. As a general rule, in order for
a third party to recover two requirements must be satisfied:  (1) the third party must be a close
family member of the person to whom the defendant is directing his (extreme and outra-
geous) conduct and (2) the defendant should be aware of the presence of the third person.
If the third person is not a close family member, then he/she must suffer bodily harm in order
to prevail. Here, many students will be "suckered" into choosing answer choice (D). Zone of
danger is a principle applicable to negligence actions (or even possibly negligent infliction of
emotional distress) and deals with duty of care to foreseeable plaintiffs. This is not a negli-
gence action, but a question that deals with intentional infliction of emotional distress. As
such, choice (C) is correct because it states one of the elements for recovery.

In order for Z (third person) to recover
against X, two requirements must be met:
Z must be a close family member of Y
and Z must be present and witness X's
extreme and outrageous conduct. If Z is a
non-family member, then she must suffer
bodily harm.

(C) By process of elimination, choice (C) would be correct. First, choice (A) is incorrect
because when Priscilla consulted Dr. Goodright she impliedly consented to his touching her
for the purposes of medical treatment. Alternative (D) is incorrect because Dr. Goodright did
not manifest any wrongful intent to inflict emotional distress. The tough choice is between (B)
and (C). Choice (B) is not the best answer because, to recover for emotional distress inflicted
through negligence, the emotional distress must follow some form of physical injury suffered
by the plaintiff. Here, the emotional distress occurred before  the plaintiff suffered physical
injury. Therefore, choice (C) is the preferred answer.

(C) This is a "tricky" Torts Multistate question dealing with private necessity. As a
general rule, private necessity will excuse tortious conduct aimed at property. However,
according to Restatement of Torts, 2d, Section 263, which specifically addresses the priv-
ilege of private necessity as applied to trespass to chattels or conversion, "Where the act is
for the benefit of the actor or a third person, he is subject to liability for any harm caused
by the exercise of the privilege." Therefore, Jensen would be liable for the damage caused
to Baxter's boat. Note that choice (D) is incorrect because Jensen is not liable for conver-
sion because he only destroyed the mast of the boat.

9. (A) Here's a very tricky Multistate example in which students are required to distinguish
between crimes and torts. Be advised that since Haller is asserting a claim against Feinstein
for damages, this is a civil action. As a result, the question really being asked is whether
Feinstein is liable for conversion? The answer is yes. According to  Restatement of Torts 2d,
Section 244, "An actor is not relieved of liability to another for conversion (or for trespass to
chattels) by his belief, because of a mistake of law or fact not induced by the other, that he has
possession of the chattel." In which case, Feinstein remains liable for conversion because the
overcoat was ruined while in her possession. There was thus a conversion even though the dis-
possession resulted from Feinstein's mistake of fact.

legally protected interest of the other, if he  intentionally  enters the land in possession of the

highway. In this regard, Vic may be liable for trespass because he was operating his car in a
reckless manner. However, where a person enters the land of another through negligence,
recklessness or as a result of an abnormally dangerous activity,  in order to be liable for tres-
pass he must cause damage to the land.  Therefore, choice (C) is a better answer than
(A) because even though Vic was reckless, he will not be liable unless he damaged Edna's
property. Note that choice (B) is not correct because Vic's entry was not intentional.

11. (D) Most general bar review outlines only review trespass in terms of intentional entries.
The Bar Examiners are "keenly" aware of this omission and thus frequently hone in on tres-
pass. According to Restatement of Torts 2d, Section 166, a person is not liable for trespass
for an "accidental" entry that is unintentional and non-negligent.  Here, for example, the
facts state that Drake hit a golf ball down the middle of the fairway. The ball struck a tree
limb and then ricocheted onto Virginia's property. Since this is an "accidental" entry, choice
(D) is correct. The Pavlov dog response is choice (B) because the general outlines advise stu-
dents that intent to trespass is not required, it is only the intent to do the act that is necessary.
MBE Exam Tip: This definition applies to intentional entries that involve mistake (meaning
that it is simply the intent to enter that is required). This particular question, however, does
not deal with an intentional entry, but an "accidental" entry that was unintentional.

(C) According to the "shopkeeper's privilege", a businessman who reasonably sus-
pects a customer of theft, or of failure to pay,  may detain the suspected individual for a
short time in order to investigate. The privilege is, however, a very restricted one, confined
to what is reasonably necessary for its limited purpose, of enabling the defendant to do
what is possible on the spot to discover the facts. There will be liability if the detention is
for a length of time beyond that which is reasonably necessary for such a short investiga-
tion. In the present case, Hardcastle was privileged to make a temporary detention since he
reasonably believed that a theft had occurred. As a result, choice (C) is correct. Note that
choice (D) is less preferred because Dwyer is asserting an action for false imprisonment.
Thus, it is irrelevant whether her seizure was foreseeable. The "key" issue here is whether
the storekeeper acted reasonably under the circumstances.

(C) A popular Multistate testing area deals with proximate or legal cause. In order to be
liable for negligence, defendant's conduct must constitute the legal or proximate cause of
plaintiff's harm or injury. According to the rule enunciated in the Palsgraf case, Judge
Cardozo stated that a defendant's duty of care is owed only to foreseeable plaintiffs (i.e. those
individuals who are within the risk of harm created by defendant's unreasonable conduct).
Choice (C) is the best answer because it addresses the fact that Bush was an unforeseeable
plaintiff to whom no duty of care was owed. Choice (B) is incorrect because transfered intent
does not apply chattel-to-person, only person-to-person.

(D) This question deals with the duty of care an owner or occupier of land owes to  per-
sons outside of the premises. The traditional rule adopted by both the English and American
courts is that a possessor of land is under no affirmative duty to remedy conditions of purely
natural origin upon his/her land. On the other hand, there is an exception in cases involving
dangerous trees. It is still the prevailing rule that the owner of rural land is not required to
inspect it to make sure that every tree is safe, and will not fall over onto a public highway. But
Prosser states that "when the tree is in an urban area, the landowner now has a duty of rea-
sonable care, including inspection to make sure that the tree is safe."  Law of Torts, pg. 390.
Moreover, recent decisions have extended the right to reasonable protection from travelers on
the street to adjoining landowners as well. Choice (D) thus correctly states the applicable rule
of law. Note that choice (A) is wrong because this question does not involve an intentional
trespass situation.

(D) There is no duty to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from caus-
ing physical harm to another unless a special relationship exists between the actor and the
third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person's conduct.
Prosser states that a special relationship exists between (a) a common carrier and its passen-
gers; (b) an innkeeper towards its guests; (c) landlords toward their tenants; (d) jailers toward
their prisoners; (e) hospitals toward their patients; and (f) schools toward their pupils. Here,
the teacher was under a duty to control the actions of the student. She breached her duty of
care by failing to act in attempting to disarm the student or to report the situation to law
enforcement authorities. However, choice (D) is preferred because it focuses on the interven-
ing force (i.e. proximate cause), rather than Shirley's initial breach of duty.

16. (C) According to Prosser, one of the most difficult questions in connection with negli-
gence is with regard "to what a person is required to know" in order to warn another of unrea-
sonable risks of harm. Obviously, an individual will not be responsible for risks that he or she
is unaware of. Therefore, since Amy did not know that the package was leaking, she did not
breach any duty of care to Beth. Choice (D) is wrong because in a joint venture the negligence
of one member is imputed to the others. Here, we are not imputing negligence. Rather, Amy
is not shown to be negligent under the given facts.  MBE Exam Tip: The duty of care that a
driver owes to a rider depends on whether the rider is viewed as a "guest" or a "passenger." If

the rider confers an economic benefit on the driver (e.g., pays for tolls or gas), then she is con-
sidered an invitee. On the other hand, a gratuitous rider is viewed as a licensee. Under the
given facts, Beth is a licensee to whom Amy's only duty was to warn of known dangerous
conditions. Since Amy was unaware of the contents of the package, she did not breach any
duty of care owed.

(B) People who enter public buildings (such as churches, airports, museums) are classi-
fied as invitees. A hotel would fall under the category of a building open to members of the
general public. Therefore, Crosby is viewed as an invitee. The duty owed to an invitee is
twofold: (1) duty to make reasonable inspections and (2) duty to make safe for the protec-
tion of invitees who enter.  Here, since the hotel breached its duty to inspect and make safe,
Crosby will be entitled to recover. Thus, choice (B) is correct.

(D) Here's an extremely "tricky" Multistate question dealing with the attractive nui-
sance or trespassing children's doctrine. Under the attractive nuisance doctrine a posses-
sor of land is subject to liability for physical harm to trespassing children where (a) an
artificial dangerous condition exists on the property; (b) the possessor knows or should
know that children are likely to trespass on the property; (c) the children because of
their youth, age or immaturity fail to appreciate the danger or realize the risks involved
in intermeddling with it; and (d) the utility of maintaining the dangerous condition is
slight compared to the risks involved.  It is important to note that the inability of a child to
appreciate the danger is a subjective test.  Therefore, choice (D) is preferred. According to
Prosser, "the child, because of his immaturity, either must not discover the condition or
must not in fact appreciate the danger involved." Torts, pg. 408. Exam Tip: Note that
choice (C) is wrong because it addresses the  objective standard of conduct to which a
child generally must conform to in order not to be held liable for negligence. In an attrac-
tive nuisance question we are not dealing with the issue as to whether a child is negligent
but rather whether the child subjectively appreciates the danger that exists.

(C) This is a very clever torts Multistate question dealing with negligence per se or
violation of statute. In order to recover for negligence per se, most courts require that (1)
the plaintiff be a member of the class of persons intended to be protected by the statute and
(2) the harm suffered must be of a type that the statute was designed to protect against. It
is important to point out that this type of statute is a "blue law" regulation, the purpose of
which is the observance of the Sabbath. Therefore, the liquor store is not automatically
liable for negligence per se merely for selling beer before noontime. Choice (C) is thus
correct because it will be necessary to show that the clerk was negligent in breaching his
duty of care owed.

(C) This is a "tricky" torts question dealing with res ipsa loquitur and directed verdicts.
A "ploy" that is frequently tested on the Multistate is to present a negligence question and
then indicate in the facts that the plaintiff has failed to present any evidence supporting the
cause of action. When a plaintiff fails to satisfy her burden of production (by presenting a
preponderance of evidence to prove the elements of her claim), the court may grant defen-
dant's motion to dismiss. However, in res ipsa loquitur situations there is an inference of
negligence on the part of the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has made a prima facie
case and no directed verdict may be given the defendant. Note the choice (A) is wrong
because res ipsa loquitur simply establishes an inference of negligence. Basically, it
allows the plaintiff to escape a nonsuit, or a dismissal of his action.  However, the infer-
ence of negligence to be drawn from the circumstances is left to the jury which may very
well find against him. Certainly, the defendant in rebuttal may present a preponderance of
evidence to avoid liability.

Hieroglyphics hired Simon Contracting Company, an independent contractor, to per-
form renovations to its building. In most jurisdictions, the owner of a commercial enterprise
open to business invitees cannot delegate responsibility for the maintenance of the public
premises to an independent contractor. If the contractor is negligent in work on the premises,
the business will also be liable. The need to protect the customer's safety is deemed more
important than the owner being held liable when he is not personally negligent because the
owner can obtain insurance or put an indemnity clause in his agreement with the contractor.
This is not strict liability as someone—the contractor— must be negligent. It is a form of
derivative or vicarious liability. Here, Simon Contracting Company was negligent in applying
the plaster. Sandy has come on the premises to buy a book; he is a business invitee. Both
Simon Contracting Company and Hieroglyphics will be liable for his injuries. Choice (A) is
not the best choice. Choice (A) states another factual argument for Hieroglyphics' liability but
not the only argument. Choice (C) is not correct. Simon Contracting Company's acts being
the cause of injury does not eliminate Hieroglyphics' liability on a vicarious liability theory.
Rather, it is a necessary element. Choice (D) is incorrect. This type of duty cannot be dele-
gated as discussed above.

(B)	
It is important to note that the MBE instructions for Torts state as follows, "Examinees
should assume that joint and several liability, with comparative negligence, is the relevant rule
unless otherwise indicated." Therefore, you must assume that pure comparative negligence
applies to this fact pattern because you are not told otherwise. As a general rule, comparative
negligence statutes have the effect of apportioning damages based on the parties' respective
degrees of fault. For example, if the defendant's fault is found to be twice as great as that of
the plaintiff, the latter will recover two-thirds of his damages, and himself bear the remainder
of his loss. In the present case, Driver was negligent in failing to keep proper lookout while
driving. By the same token, defendant was also at fault since he left an abandoned auto in the
middle of the highway. As a consequence, plaintiff's recovery will be diminished in propor-
tion to his negligence. Note that choice (C) is wrong because the "last clear chance" doctrine
is applied in contributory, not comparative, negligence jurisdictions.

any logical, reasonable, or practical division. Death may be such a result, and so may be a
broken leg or any single wound, the destruction of a house by fire, or the sinking of a barge.
Where two or more causes combine to produce such a single result, incapable of any logical
division, each may be a substantial factor in bringing about the loss, and if so,  each must be
charged with all of it.  In this situation, most courts place the burden of proof on the issue of

causation upon the two defendants. Unless the innocent defendant can prove that he or she is
not culpable, liability will be imposed. This is the rule enunciated in the case of Summers v.
Tice, 1999 P.2d 1 (1948). Choice (B) is therefore correct.

(B) Once again, you are instructed to assume pure comparative negligence unless told oth-
erwise. In a "pure" comparative negligence jurisdiction, a plaintiff's contributory negligence
does not operate to bar her recovery altogether, but does serve to reduce her damages in pro-
portion to her fault. Thus, a plaintiff can recover even if her fault is greater than 50%. In this
example, plaintiff Dawkins' damages award of $100,000 will be reduced by the percentage of
fault attributed to her, namely 30% or $30,000. The remaining amount, $70,000 will then be
reduced by an additional $20,000 representing the payment made by defendant Cunningham's
insurance company to plaintiff, since this amount comprises part of the $100,000 damage
award itself. Therefore, Dawkins will recover $50,000. Choice (B) is correct. Note that choice
(C) is incorrect because the "collateral sources" rule covers situations where the plaintiff has
recovered damages from his or her own insurance company. Such benefit will not reduce or
effect the amount of recovery from the tortfeasor. However, the "collateral sources" rule does
not apply here because the defendant's insurance company paid part of  plaintiff's damages.

(A) On all standardized examinations (whether it be the MBE, SAT, LSAT, GRE) the
Examiner's main goal is "to hide the correct answer".  The Examiners try to accomplish
this by employing "distractors", "red herrings" and "Pavlov dog" responses. Here, the
comparative negligence statute is the "distractor".  A comparative negligence statute only
applies when the two negligent parties (e.g., Feller-Pafko) are suing one another.  On the
contrary, Wertz was a passenger who was injured by the combined negligent acts of both
Feller and Pafko. Therefore, Feller and Pafko are joint tortfeasors who would be jointly
and severally liable for the full amount of (Wertz's) damages. Choice (A) is correct
because Wertz may recover full damages from Pafko who could then seek contribution
from Feller.

(C) Restatement of Torts 2d,  Section 885(1) provides: "A valid release by one tortfeasor
from liability for harm, given by the injured person, does not discharge others liable for the
same harm, unless it is agreed that it will discharge them." However, subsection (3) states, "A
payment by any person made in compensation of a claim for a harm for which others are liable
as tortfeasors diminishes the claim against the tortfeasors, at least to the extent of the payment
made, whether or not the person making the payment is liable to the injured person and
whether or not it is so agreed at the time of payment or the payment is made before or after
judgment." Based on this aforesaid section, choice (C) is correct because Householder's claim
against Visitor will be diminished by $12,500 (or the amount of his recovery from Resident).

(B) In order to answer this question, it is necessary to determine Candace's tort status.
Since the facts state that Safeway permitted Westside parents to park on the lot  with the
those entering the premises will be
expectation that they would shop in the supermarket, 
viewed as invitees (or "business" visitors). Prosser states that a person may be classified
as an invitee even though she does not actually confer an economic benefit to the posses-
sor. The important consideration is whether there is a  potential pecuniary profit  to be
gained. This same issue was tested on a recent MBE exam when a person entered a super-
market with no intention of buying anything but to change a $1 bill for the parking meter.
He nonetheless was an invitee. Although Candace is an invitee, choice (B) is a better
answer than (A). A shopkeeper generally is not liable for the intentional tortious acts of
third persons unless the defendant is aware of such a danger. See Prosser, pg. 202 where a
shopping mall owner was held liable for an assault in the parking lot since he had knowl-
edge of prior criminal attacks on shopping center patrons.

(B) Prosser states that "if the intervening cause is one which in ordinary human experi-
ence is reasonably to be anticipated, or one which the  defendant has reason to anticipate
under the particular circumstances,  he may be negligent, among other reasons, because he
has failed to guard against it; or he may be negligent only for that reason." Furthermore,
Prosser notes that "even though the intervening cause may be regarded as foreseeable, the
defendant is not liable unless his conduct has created or increased an unreasonable risk of
harm  through its intervention." Thus, "there may be an appreciable danger that the plaintiff
will be struck by lightning, or by an automobile in the street, or a mail sack thrown from a
train, or that a kerosene lamp will explode in his face, but there is  no liability unless what the
defendant has done has increased the risk."  Thus, since Farmer increased the risk of harm
by stopping his tractor on the top of the hill, choice  (B) is the best answer. See Prosser,  Law
of Torts, pp. 274-275.

(B) It is well established that a defendant is held liable for foreseeable intervening caus-
es. Examples of foreseeable intervening causes include: (1) subsequent medical malpractice;
(2) negligence of rescuers; (3) subsequent disease; and (4) subsequent accident. Where the
defendant suffers a subsequent injury following her original injury, and the original injury was
a substantial factor in causing the second accident, the original tortfeasor is usually held liable
for damages arising from the second accident. As a consequence, choice (B) is correct because
Sally's eye injury was a substantial factor in causing her injury at Home Depot due to her
vision impairment.

(B) On a recent Multistate Bar Examination a similar issue dealing with fireworks was
tested. The Examiners held that fireworks is  not a per se ultrahazardous activity. This appears
to be the emerging trend nationally which should now be followed on the bar exam. Today,
fireworks displays are rather commonplace in society and frequently occur at sporting events,
Fourth of July celebrations and concerts. As a result, when confronted with MBE questions
Therefore,
involving fireworks, students are instructed to apply a negligence standard. 
choice (B) is correct because if Roman was negligent, then Cal would be vicariously liable
under a joint venture theory.

(B) Transporting a large quantity of highly flammable chemicals in one's automobile
is an abnormally dangerous activity.  Consequently, Pierre is subject to strict liability
based upon Restatement §519 which states: "One who carries on an abnormally danger-
ous activity is subject to (strict) liability for harm to the person, land or chattels of anoth-
er resulting from the activity, although he has exercised the utmost care to prevent the
harm.

32. (D) Under Restatement of Torts, 2d §519, (1) "One who carries on an abnormally
dangerous activity is subject to (strict) liability for harm to the person, land or chattels of
another resulting from the activity, although he has exercised the utmost care to prevent the
harm. (2) This strict liability is limited to the kind of harm, the possibility of which makes
the activity abnormally dangerous." While it is true that blasting is an abnormally danger-
ous activity, the extent of protection under the rule only applies to  harm which is within
the scope of the abnormal risk that is the basis of the liability.  Thus, one who transports
explosives is not liable for every possible harm  that may result from carrying on that activ-
ity. The owner of a truck carrying dynamite would be strictly liable if an explosion occurs
during transport, but not strictly liable if the truck containing explosives simply runs over
a pedestrian. Likewise, if the blasting had caused the building that housed plaintiff's mink
to collapse, strict liability would apply. However, the fact that due to fright Powell's adult
mink ate their young is an example of harm which is outside the scope of the abnormal risk
created by Davis' blasting operations. Strict liability would not apply. The facts also indi-
cate Davis was not negligent, so Powell will not prevail for the loss of his mink. Choice
(D) is the correct answer. See Restatement of Torts, 2d §519, Illustration 1.

According to Restatement of Torts, 2d, Section 507, "A possessor of a wild animal
is subject to (strict) liability to another for harm done by the animal to the other, his person,
land or chattels, although the possessor has exercised the utmost care to confine the animal,
otherwise to prevent it from doing harm." This fact situation is analogous to  Restatement
Illustration 1, Sec. 507, pg. 13, in which a pet chimpanzee escaped from defendant's prop-
erty and approached a group of children. The mother of one of the children erroneously think-
ing the chimpanzee was about to attack her child, rushed to her child's assistance and in her
hurry and excitement, she stumbled and fell, breaking her leg. In accord with the position
taken by the Restatement, the owner of the monkey is subject to strict liability. Note that
choice (B) is wrong because despite the fact that the defendant(s) may have exercised utmost
care to prevent the animal's escape, they are nonetheless strictly liable. Choice (C) is incor-
rect because it is not necessary that the possessor should have reason to know that the partic-
ular animal possesses a dangerous propensity. Although he may reasonably believe that it has
been so tamed as to have lost all of these propensities, nonetheless he takes the risk that at any
moment the animal may revert to and exhibit them. Choice (D) is wrong because a wild ani-
mal not kept under effective control is dangerous to the personal security of others not only
because it is likely to attack them but also because the fear of an attack may cause injury to
result.

(A) Most importantly, students must recognize that this question involves strict products
liability. Leff is alleging that the ignition switch was "defective" and "unreasonably dan-
gerous" which are the required elements for strict products liability. As a general rule, the
only defense in strict liability is assumption of risk, not contributory negligence. Choice (C)
is wrong because it addresses contributory negligence. Always remember the main difference
between assumption of risk and contributory negligence is that  assumption of risk is a sub-
jective standard. The plaintiff must subjectively be aware of the danger and knowingly expose
himself or herself to the danger. On the other hand, contributory negligence is an objective
standard where the plaintiff's conduct falls below the applicable standard of care necessary
for his or her own protection. In this question, Leff was not aware of the danger of the fork-
lift restarting by trying to reinsert the ignition switch. In addition, choice (B) is incorrect
because this is not a breach of warranty action but rather a strict liability action. Likewise,
choice (D) is wrong because it addresses negligence, not strict liability. By process of elimi-
nation, choice (A) is the best answer.

35.

(B) Strict products liability is one of the most heavily tested areas on the bar exam
(both on the essays and the MBE)! According to  Restatement Section 402(A), one who
sells a product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer
is strictly liable for the harm or injury caused. In order to prevent a product from being
unreasonably dangerous, the seller may be required to give directions or warning on the
container, as to its use. If the product contains an ingredient to which a substantial num-

pstaboo

ber of the population are allergic, and the ingredient is one whose danger is not generally
known, or if known is one which the consumer would reasonably not expect to find in the
product, the seller is required to give warning against it. But Restatement subsection (j)
advises that a seller is not required to warn with respect to products which are only dan-
gerous, or potentially so, when consumed in excessive quantity, or over a long period of
time, when the danger, or potentiality of danger, is generally known and recognized.
Choice (B) is therefore correct.

(C) Under the consumer-contemplation test  as stated in Section 402A of the
Restatement of Torts 2d,  any "foreseeable user" or "ordinary user" of a defectively danger-
ous product may recover for strict liability. Prosser states that "the user may be a member of
the family of the final purchaser, or his employee, or a guest at his table, or a mere donee from
the purchaser." In this regard, a thief is not regarded as a reasonably foreseeable user contem-
plated by the drafters of the Restatement. Note that (D) is wrong because Tomlin loses due to
his status as an unforeseeable user not because of his misuse of the vehicle.

(B) As noted earlier, practically every Multistate question will test a fineline distinction
or nuance. In the area of Torts it is imperative to distinguish between strict liability and neg-
ligence actions. Here, Driver is suing for strict liability. As such statement I is inapplicable
because it addresses the breach of duty requirement for negligence. By the same token, state-
ment III is a non-factor because contributory negligence is not a defense in strict liability
actions. As such, choice (B) is correct because it is necessary that ACC be engaged in the busi-
ness of selling autos to be held strictly liable.

(C) A product may be unreasonably dangerous if there is an inadequate warning
regarding its use. The warning on the shampoo bottle was adequate. American manufac-
turers are not required to place warnings in different languages on products sold within the
United States. Choice (D) is wrong because assumption of risk applies when the plaintiff
subjectively is aware of the risk and consciously disregards it. In the present hypo, Nikita
was unaware of the risk because she didn't understand English.

(A) A popular Multistate testing area deals with negligent misrepresentation. Prosser
notes that "a representation made with an honest belief in its truth may still be negligent,
because of lack of reasonable care in ascertaining the facts, or in the manner of expression or
absence of the skill and competence required by a particular business or profession", Prosser,
pg. 704. In this regard, misrepresentation frequently occurs in ordinary negligence actions for
personal injuries or property damage, in the form of misleading words or acts, or non-disclo-
sure of known facts, and the courts have not found it necessary to distinguish it in any way
from any other negligence. Suzy read the sign which expressly stated Aspen's slopes were the
"smoothest and safest" in Colorado and she was skiing "along the outer edge of the ski trail"
at the time of her injury. Aspen will be liable based on a theory of negligent misrepresenta-
tion. Choice (A) is correct. Note that choice (B) is incorrect. Aspen's duty was to warn of
known dangerous natural and artificial conditions. The tree root that injured Suzy was con-
cealed by snow.

40. (B) There are five elements required to establish a claim for deceit: (1) there must be a
material misrepresentation, (2) the defendant must act with scienter, (3) the defendant must
intend to induce reliance, (4) the plaintiff must justifiably rely on the misrepresentation, and
(5) the plaintiff must suffer pecuniary damages. The key to this question is understanding the
element of scienter. This element is satisfied in two situations: (1) when the defendant lies, or
(2) when the defendant makes a statement of fact not knowing whether it is true or false. Here,
Prof stated that Grad had never been convicted of a theft crime even though she was aware

that she did not know the answer to this question. Therefore, Prof acted with scienter when
she stated that Grad had never been convicted of a theft crime. Choice (C) is not correct
because, while much of Prof's statement consists of opinion which would not be actionable,
Prof stated a fact when she asserted that Grad had never been convicted of a crime. Choice
(D) is incorrect because the requirement is that the defendant act with scienter, and intention-
ally lying is just one way of satisfying this element.

(C) First of all, choice (A) is incorrect, and Disease Care's motion will be denied.
According to Prosser, when defendant's conduct involves mere physical discomfort or mental
annoyance, there is somewhat more difficulty in deciding when the interference is substantial
and unreasonable. Probably a good working rule would be that the annoyance cannot be
unreasonable interference until it results in a depreciation in the market or rental value of the
land. Here, the facts state that McMartin will suffer severe economic loss if the AIDS clinic
is constructed. The Multistate "distractor" is the children's unfounded fear of contracting
AIDS. In this regard, Prosser states that 'fears and feelings common to members of the com-
munity are to be considered; and the dread of contagion from a pesthouse may make it a nui-
sance even though there is no foundation in scientific fact."  Law of Torts, 2d Edition, pg. 629.
Choice (D) is a very good private nuisance answer, but the language "if, and only if" make it
too narrow. Choice (C) is preferred because a motion for summary judgment will be granted
only where no material issue of fact exists. The statement McMartin realized he would "suf-
fer severe economic loss" presents a triable issue, thus making choice (C) a correct statement.

(B) The best methodology for answering multiple-choice questions is  by process of elim-
ination. This is a "tricky" Torts question because Rula is asserting an "action" which could be
either trespass or nuisance. Thus, it is necessary to carefully read each answer choice in
addressing both possible causes of action. Choice (A) is wrong because "coming to the nui-
sance" is never an absolute defense in a nuisance action but rather is merely one factor the
court will take into consideration. Choice (C) is incorrect because  trespass requires the entry
or invasion of a tangible thing or person.  Although invisible gases and microscopic particles
will suffice, Prosser states it is "not a trespass to project light, noise, or vibrations across or
onto the land of another." Law of Torts, pg. 71. Choice (D) is wrong because in nuisance
actions the disturbance must be annoying, offensive or inconvenient to a  "normal person in
the particular locality." In this regard, Prosser states that "the plaintiff cannot, by devoting his
own land to an unusually sensitive use," recover for nuisance. Law of Torts, pg. 628.
Therefore, choice (B) is the best answer because normal persons in the community are not
offended by the sound waves because they are not audible to people.

(D) A public nuisance is an act by the defendant that obstructs, inconveniences or damages
the enjoyment or use of common property. A private plaintiff may only maintain an action if he
suffers an injury peculiar to that suffered by the general public. For Fred to prevail in a public
nuisance action he must prove that he suffers a peculiar harm that differs from the harm suffered
by the general public. In which case, Fred must prove special damages to support his claim.

(C) Since choice (C) is not an example of slander per se, Henry would need to prove
special damages in order to recover against Ron in defamation. Choice (C) is not slander per
se, because Ron is not accusing Henry of committing a crime. Instead, Ron is making the
statement that Henry would have stabbed his mother if she had not been killed in an auto
accident. The other three answer choices provide students with examples of slander per se,
wherein the plaintiff can recover damages without proving that he has suffered any special
harm at all. The cause of action is complete when the plaintiff proves that such a type of
slander has been published about him and that he has suffered "actual injury" as a result of
the defamatory statement. It is important for students to note the 4 per se categories for either
slander or libel. Sections 571-574 of the  Restatement 2d, Torts provides that "an action for

postbzo

TORTS

slander will lie without proof of special harm only where: (1) The words impute a criminal
offense which, if committed in the place of publication, (a) would be punishable by death or
imprisonment or (b) regarded by public opinion as involving moral turpitude. (2) The words
impute to the plaintiff a presently existing venereal or other loathsome and communicable
disease. (3) The words impute to the plaintiff conduct, characteristics, or a condition
incompatible with the proper conduct of his lawful business, trade, profession or with his
public or private office, whether honorary or for profit. (4) The words impute to a woman
unchastity.

(C) The attached question is based on the facts of  Roche v. Egan, 433 A.2d 757 (Maine
Supreme Judicial Ct. Aug. 12, 1981). Roger will want to eliminate his liability for defamation
or at least want to point to facts that will subject him to a lower standard (i.e. the standard that
applies to defamation of a public official). Choice (A) is wrong. Even though there may be no
implied malice, there can still be defamation of a public official under New York Times v.
Sullivan for actual malice. In addition, (A) refers to slander, and the written communication
in this fact situation, if defamatory, is libel. Choice (B) is wrong on the principle of law stated.
As stated in Roche, the U.S. Supreme Court has stopped short of the conclusion that all pub-
lic employees are public officials. Even if such were the case, that would still not mean that
Rusty may not recover any damages. Choice (C) is the best answer. These are facts Roger
would want to point out to support his claim that a police patrolman is a public official to
whom the Times v. Sullivan  standard applies. Choice (D) is wrong. There can still be damages
to reputation, nominal damages, punitive damages, etc.

(D) This same defamation issue has been tested on the last two administrations of the
MBE. It is important to remember that the defamatory meaning of a statement must be
communicated. Thus, the utterance must be understood by the third person. Accordingly,
Prosser notes that "words spoken in a foreign tongue are not actionable unless they are
heard by one who understands the language."  Torts, pg. 798. Since Shannon didn't
understand the Spanish translation, choice (D) is the best answer.

(D) This is a very typical Multistate Torts example where most students will narrow the
correct answer down to choices (C) and (D). Choice (C) deals with  slander per se,  whereas
choice (D) relates to defamation of a public figure with malice. First, let's review the 4 types
of slander per se which are actionable without proof of special damages (since injury to rep-
utation is presumed):  (1) defamatory statement adversely reflecting on plaintiff's trade, busi-
ness or profession; (2) defamatory statement imputing loathsome disease; (3) defamatory
statement imputing unchastity to a woman; (4) defamatory statement charging the plaintiff is
guilty of a crime involving moral turpitude. Here, Brothers' statement charging Michaelson
with being a "poor administrator" may be actionable without proof of  damages.  However,
choice (D) is preferred because it addresses the required elements of both  fault and falsity  (i.e.
malice standard),  rather than the issue of damage only.

(C) Remember that invasion of right of privacy  is not a single tort but comprises the fol-
lowing four distinct causes of action: (1) appropriation, (2) false light,  (3) public disclosure
In order to recover for
of private facts, and (4) intrusions on one's seclusion and solitude. 
public disclosure, the facts disclosed must be private facts, and not public ones. In this hypo,
the picture was a matter of public concern because it showed Olivia and Reese, as hotel guests,
outside witnessing the fire. Prosser further states that a defense to this type of action is
whether there is a legitimate public interest in having the information made available. Clearly,
the newspaper's coverage of the hotel fire was a newsworthy event. Choice (C) is thus correct.

Multistate Torts Variation:

Willie "Say Hay" Maples was a famous all-star player for
the Boston Braves. In 1936 Willie set a professional baseball
record by hitting safely in 82 consecutive games. After Willie
retired in 1942, he was one of the original inductees in base-
ball's Hall of Fame. After his retirement, however, Willie
became a recluse and refused to be interviewed or have his
picture taken. Forty years later in 1982, Red Smyth, a sports
writer for "Sports Illustrated" magazine, decided to write a
story about Maples' illustrious career. Smyth contacted
Maples on numerous occasions, but the retired Hall of
Famer refused to be interviewed. One afternoon, Smyth
went to Maples' home and rang the doorbell. When Maples
opened the door, Smyth took his picture without permission.
The picture, though it was never published, depicted Maples
as a decrepit, enfebbled old man. If Maples brings suit
against Smyth and "Sports Illustrated" for invasion of right to
privacy, the plaintiff will most likely

(A) recover, since Smyth's actions intruded on Maples

privacy

(B) recover, since Maples did not consent to have his

picture taken

(C) not recover, because Maples had been a public

figure

(D) not recover, because the picture was not published

Answer: (A)

49.

50.

(A)	
Appropriation is defined as the unauthorized use by defendant of plaintiff's picture
or name for defendant's commercial advantage.  Clearly, Mogan is liable for invasion of right
to privacy by appropriating Jordan's picture in his commercial advertising. In all likelihood,
Mogan is not liable for negligent misrepresentation which requires a false statement inducing
reliance on the part of the plaintiff. Mogan did not engage in any false representation.
Similarly, statement II is inapplicable because negligent infliction of emotional distress
requires extreme and outrageous conduct resulting in physical harm or bodily injury. Mogan's
conduct was not necessarily extreme and outrageous. Furthermore, Jordan was embarrassed
but did not suffer physical harm or injury.

Here's an extremely difficult Multistate example which requires students to differen-
(A)	
tiate between defamation and invasion of privacy. Although Kosale falsely depicted Marvel's
accomplishments, he did not really defame him.  Defamatory material is that which tends to
lower the reputation of a person by impugning his (or her) honesty, integrity, or sanity, or by
diminishing the esteem, respect or confidence in which the person is held. By enhancing
Marvel's exploits, Kosale did not lower or diminish his reputation. On the other hand, Kosale
would be liable for invasion of right to privacy by casting Marvel in a "false light." In order
to establish a prima facie case for "false light," the following elements must be proven:
(1) publication of facts which place the plaintiff in a false light; (2) the false light is objec-
tionable to a reasonable person; and (3) malice on the part of defendant where the published
material is in the public interest.

DEFAMATION

DEFAMATORY STATEMENT — one which subjects P to hatred, contempt, or ridicule (1st Restatement) or which lowers the esteem in which P is held by third parties (2nd Restatement)

OF OR CONCERNING P — someone must
recognize that the statement is about this
particular P

P must be a living human being

Group defamation

Small group (less than 25) — all members may have action even if statement is not all-inclusive

Medium group (between 25 and 150) —  may give each member a cause of action if all-inclusive

Large group (over 150) — no member may sue even if statement is all-inclusive

PUBLICATION — at least one third party must hear the statement and understand its defamatory nature; D must be at least negligent with regard to the publication

Special Damages — pecuniary loss resulting from a third party's response to the defamatory statement

PROOF OF SPECIAL DAMAGES OR
EXCEPTION (a prima facie case
requirement, not a rule of damages)

Slander per se — oral statements relating to: (1) incompetence in trade or profession, (2) present loathsome disease, (3)
commission of serious crime, or (4) lack of chastity of a woman

Exceptions

Libel (written statements) —  in some
states all libel is actionable without proof
of special damages, but common law
required special damages unless libel is

Truth must go to defamatory sting

On its face — (no innuendo or external knowledge is required to
understand the statement's defamatory nature)  or

Forseeable Plaintiff

Andrews — if D has breached a duty to anyone, duty is owed to everyone

Rescuers are always forseeable Ps

Omission — as a general rule, there is not
duty to act or aid another. The exceptions
include:

Reasonable Person Standard — what would
a reasonable person have done in those
circumstances. Balance (1) likelihood of
harm and (2) gravity of potential injury
against (3) social utility of D's actual

Standards for Professionals (Malpractice) —
the minimum common skill of members in
good standing in the profession. Expert
testimony is required except when
negligence is obvious

Statutes — if statute establishes civil liability,
it conclusively establishes standard. If
criminal statute ask (1) is P in a class that the
statute was designed to protect (2) was he to
be protected from this type of harm; if
answer to both questions is "yes" then

Duty to alleviate consequences of his own act endangers others (perhaps even if D's act was not

even negligent)

contractual duty

Duty to control others (e.g., children)

innkeepers and guest

Special relationship between P and D
including:

common carriers and passengers

school and pupils

Undertaking to act — may not abandon an attempted rescue if D leaves P's in a worse condition

NOTE: Always consider cause-in-fact issue in all omission problems

Mental characteristics of adult defendant irrelevant

Physical characteristics of adult defendant may be considered

Children must act as would children of the same age, experience, and intelligence except that they
are measured by adult standards when they are engaged in adult activities

Emergency situation will lower D's standard if, but only if, D's own negligence did not cause

emergency

Community custom is relevant to establishing what is reasonable, but it is not determinative

Locality Rule — at common law, conduct of general practitioners was measured by what others in
the same or similar localities would do (today, locality rule is simply a factor in most states)

Specialists — held to national standard

Negligence Per Se (majority rule) —  D may not introduce evidence as to reasonableness,
although she may argue for an implied exception (i.e., because of the unique circumstances of this
case, what she did was inherently more reasonable than what the statute required)

Presumption of Negligence — D may argue that his conduct was nevertheless reasonable
despite the statute, but has the burden of proving this

Evidence of Negligence — violation merely helps P establish his prima facie case (Note: Most
jurisdictions follow this rule for violation of local ordinances.)

Caveat — under any of these views the issues of cause-in-fact, proximate cause, and compensible
damage issues are the same as in any other negligence action. Contributory negligence and
assumption of risk issues are also the same except when statute was designed to protect P from

his own folly

BREACH

Res Ipsa Loquitur — circumstantial evidence of negligence
arises when

Accident is one that normally does not occur in the absence of
negligence

Instrumentality causing injury is under D's exclusive control or D is
responsible for all others in control

P must introduce evidence removing any inference of his own fault

Concurrent Conduct — even conduct which is not negligent by itself will be actionable if it combines with similar conduct of others if the other's
conduct was foreseeable

"But for" Test — normally, ask if injury would have occurred but for that aspect of D's conduct which was negligent

CAUSE-IN-FACT
(Actual Cause)

Substantial Factor Test (or Superabundant Cause) — when two or more causes concur to cause an event but either alone would have been sufficient
to cause injury, each is a cause-in-fact if it is a substantial factor in causing the injury

When two or more Ds are negligent but P cannot prove whose negligence caused the injury, court may shift burden of disproving causation to Ds

PROXIMATE CAUSE
(Legal Cause)

Look for cause-in-fact issues in all omission problems.

Spotting the Issue — look for

Freakish results

Multiple persons or factors contributing to the injury

Minor negligence causing tremendous injury

Basic Rules

Direct Injury Cases (i.e., there are no inter-
vening causes between D's negligence and
P's injury)

Injury to Persons — all direct causes are proximate

Injury to Property	

Traditional View — all direct causes are proximate
Trend — was this injury a foreseeable result of D's
conduct?

Indirect Injury Cases — was this injury a foreseeable result of D's conduct (even if the exact way in which the injury
occurred was unforeseeable)?

Subsequent negligence, including medical malpractice, is always foreseeable

Subsequent criminal acts or intentional tortious conduct are not normally foreseeable, but may be foreseeable if that risk is
what made D's conduct negligent in the first place

Decided Cases

An attempted rescue is always foreseeable

Acts of nature are generally unforeseeable

Suicide is unforeseeable unless it was the result of an uncontrollable impulse caused by D's negligence

Only a few states (including Florida) still require
Emotional Injury — recoverable only if there is some accompanying physical injury 
impact

DAMAGES —	

Pure economic injury not protectible by negligence cause of action

Trend is to allow recovery even if emotional injury
was not caused by P's concern for her own safety

DEFENSES TO NEGLIGENCE

Normally, the issue of P's contributory negligence is controlled by the same rules as those governing D's negligence, except that the mental defects of an

adult P may be considered

Imputed Contributory Negligence — as a general rule, the negligence of a third party will be imputed to P only if P would have been vicariously liable for

the third party's negligence if P had been the defendant

CONTRIBUTORY
NEGLIGENCE

Traditional View — P's action 	
is totally barred except that

Effect of a finding of
contributory negligence

P's ordinary negligence will be ignored
if D's conduct was willful and wanton
or reckless

Last Clear Chance — P's negligence
may be irrelevant if D had the last clear
chance to avoid the danger created by
P's prior negligence (including the
actual ability to avoid the accident)

If D sees a helpless P, D had the last
clear chance

If D sees a negligently inattentive P and
should have known that P was unaware
of the danger, D has the last clear
chance

If D should have seen a helpless P, D
has the last clear chance under the
Restatement, but not in states following
the doctrine of discovered peril

If D should have seen a negligently inat-
tentive P but doesn't, D does not have
the last clear chance

Comparative Negligence — most states now
simply reduce P's recovery by the percentage
that his own negligence contributed to the
injury. Apply comparative negligence on the
MBE unless the facts state otherwise.

Traditional View — a complete defense

Pure (including Alaska, California, Florida, Michigan, and
New York) — P always collects something from a negligent D

Restricted (including Massachusetts, Minnesota, and
Pennsylvania) — P can collect only if D was at least as
negligent as P

"Willful and wanton" rule and Last Clear Chance doctrine (as dis-
cussed above) are inapplicable

ASSUMPTION OF RISK — when P actually understands
the risk to his safety and voluntarily subjects himself to it

Comparative Negligence Jurisdictions — assumption of risk is normally treated as an aspect of contributory negligence (and is
thus only a partial bar), but may still be a total bar when D's only duty was to warn (as in certain landowner and products liability

cases)

If D knows that trespassers are frequently on his land, he
must post warnings of known dangers

Licencees — those entering with permission,
but not for the purpose for which the
property is maintained (includes social
guests, firefighters, and police officers)

D must warn of known dangers (or fix if extremely
dangerous)

TRADITIONAL VIEW — look at status of P

Invitees — those entering with permission
and for the purpose for which the land is
maintained

Child Trespassers — D is liable if a child
is injured due to a dangerous condition of
D's land if:

D must make reasonable inspection for dangerous
conditions

Must warn of all dangers of which D knows or could have
discovered by a reasonable inspection (and must fix it if
very dangerous)

D knows or has reason to know that children are likely to
trespass

D knows or has reason to know that condition is
dangerous to children

Children are unable to appreciate dangerousness of
condition

The utility of the condition and burdens of protecting
children are slight in comparison to the danger

Note: Child need not have been attracted onto the land
by the dangerous condition

RECENT TREND — some states (including California and New York) have replaced the above rules with ordinary negligence principles (i.e., D must act as a reasonable person would

considering all of the circumstances). A few others (including Massachusetts and Minnesota) have done the same with regard to those lawfully on the land (i.e., licencees and invitees), but
still retain the traditional views as to trespassers.

(C)	
The language in the deed created a covenant between the grantor and the grantee.
Anders retained no property interest in the land. Burton fulfilled his obligation under the
contract by constructing a public health center within the prescribed period. Whether the
subsequent rededication of the properties' use is a breach of the covenant is a matter not
contemplated by the question. Because the language of the deed created only a contractual
obligation, answer (C) is correct.

(C)	
A fee simple subject to condition subsequent  is an estate in fee simple that may
be terminated by the conveyor, or those claiming under him, upon the happening of a
named event. However, an estate in fee simple subject to condition subsequent does not
end, ipso facto, upon the happening of the named event. The estate continues despite the
breach of the specified condition until it is divested by the grantor's power of termination
(or right of reentry). Smith and Boyer, Real Property, p. 9. The grantor's right to reenter
is optional. It may be accomplished by either making an entry on the land or bringing an
action to recover the estate. In this question Gilbert has merely demanded that Jared sur-
render possession but has neither made a reentry nor brought an ejectment action in court.
If Gilbert is wrong in stating that he once again owns Meadowlands it will be because he
has not yet taken steps to enforce his rights. Choice (C) is correct.

3. (D) First, it is necessary to determine what interest was conveyed to Abel. According
to the given facts, Owen conveyed Greenacre to "Abel upon condition precedent that he
earn a college degree by age 30." If this condition occurs, title to the property would pass
from Owen to Abel. As a result, Abel has a shifting executory interest which would "cut
short" the preceding fee estate owned by Owen. In distinguishing between a contingent
remainder and an executory interest, always remember that a contingent remainder must
follow the natural termination of the preceding estate while an executory interest termi-
nates the prior estate before its natural termination. Since an executory interest is contin-
gent, Abel does not have the power to evict Baker who is viewed as Owen's tenant. Once
Abel's interest "vests" upon his earning a college degree (before the age of 30), then he
would have the right to immediate possession of Greenacre and have the right to terminate
Baker's tenancy.

The facts clearly state that Hernandez conveyed a life estate to Gomez with a
(C)	
remainder in fee to Tampica. Since a life estate is alienable, Gomez did have the power to
convey his life interest to Tavarez. With respect to the question of the alienability of a life
estate, Boyer states that "a life tenant can convey his or her estate to a third person."
Introduction to Real Property,  pg. 59. As a consequence, the correct answer is (C). Note
that a life tenant cannot convey a greater estate than his own. As such, Tavarez's life estate
will extend not for his lifetime but for the lifetime of Gomez.

As life tenant, Young could only lease an interest in Farmacre equal to his own inter-
(D)	
est. Since Young's right to Farmacre terminated immediately upon his death, the lease to
Agronomist was of this same right; Agronomist was entitled to possession of Farmacre, at the
stated rent, for ten years or until Young's death, whichever came first. If Agronomist was
deceived as to the nature of the interest he was leasing, he must obtain satisfaction from
Young's estate. As a remainderman, Infant's right to possession of Farmacre matured at the
instant of Young's death, and he need not honor the lease nor compensate Agronomist in any
way for having rightfully dispossessed him. Choice (A) is inaccurate. As indicated above,
Agronomist's lease gave him no more right than Young to Farmacre. Upon Young's death, all
rights in Young or deriving from Young terminated. Infant takes Farmacre as remainderman
free of any encumbrances executed by Young. A different rule would permit a life tenant to
expand his interest at the expense of the remainderman by leasing or mortgaging the property.
Choice (B) is incorrect for the same reasons discussed above in connection with choice (A).
Choice (C) is not the best choice. Infant need not compensate Agronomist for the portion of
prepaid rent attributable to the remainder of the lease year. Agronomist's rights derive com-
pletely from Young and cannot exceed Young's rights, which terminated completely upon
Young's death. Young leased to Agronomist his (Young's) right to possession of Farmacre
during his life. When that life ended, so did all right to Farmacre.

A restraint against alienation of an inheritable future interest is void where the
(D)	
restraint may continue in effect after the future interest becomes possessory. This same issue
was tested on a recent MBE and it was held that a restraint against alienation applied to an
inheritable future interest is void to the same extent that the restraint would be void if the
future interest were presently possessory (i.e., if the future interest will result in a fee simple,
the restraint is void from its inception). In this question, if Ariel dies with a surviving child
under age 30, then the restraint on alienation will continue in effect after that child's remain-
der interest becomes possessory, and thus the restraint is void. The effect of voiding the
restraint is that the children take free of the restraint. The validity of the gifts to them there-
fore is not affected.

The Rule Against Perpetuities applies to the following six types of future interests: (1)
(B)	
options to purchase connected with a fee; (2) executory interests; (3) contingent remainders;
(4) powers of appointment; (5) class gifts and; (6) rights of first refusal. In order to be valid,
these interests must vest, if at all, within twenty-one years after some life in being. In this case,
since the option extends for twenty-five years, it is possible that no interest will vest in Garp
within the perpetuity period. As a result, choice (B) is the best answer.

(D) According to the common law rule, a mortgage results in a transfer of ownership to
the mortgagee (in a title theory jurisdiction). Applying this rule, a mortgage of joint tenancy
property, given by one of the joint tenants, results in a termination of the joint tenancy because
it terminates the unity of title as well as the unity of interest. See Burby,  Law of Property,
pg. 221. Furthermore, because a tenancy in common has no unity of interest, Gale's undivided
one-half interest in Roundacre was not encumbered by Elgin's mortgage. Gale will take free
of the mortgage, whereas Erickson will take subject to the mortgage. Choice (D) is correct.

(A) A highly tested Multistate Property area deals with partition proceedings. First, it is
important to point out that the filing of a complaint for partition does  not result in the sever-
ance of a joint tenancy. The rationale for this rule is that the complaint may be withdrawn at
any time before the equity court compels partition. Moreover, the right of survivorship will
attach if a joint tenant dies prior to that time. As a consequence, choice  (D) is wrong because
it provides an incorrect statement of law. By the same token, choice (C) is incorrect because
Gump's partition does not survive his death. In accordance with the right of survivorship,
Gump's joint tenancy interest was severed at the moment of his death. Furthermore, choices
(C) and (D) are wrong because (after Gump's death) Hernandez and Iba continue to hold title
to Blackacre as joint tenants. In this regard, students should be aware that whenever there are
three (or more) joint tenants and one dies, then the survivors still own title to the property as
joint tenants. On the other hand, in the event that two persons own title as joint tenants, and
one of them dies, then the joint tenancy is severed and the survivor owns an undivided
one-half interest in the property.

10. (B) This is an extremely "clever" Multistate question dealing with partition. It is
important to point out that partition proceedings are under the jurisdiction of a court of
equity. According to Burby, "reasonable restraints upon the rights of partition are valid."
Property, pg. 428. Whether or not such restraints are reasonable is determined by refer-
ence to the length of time involved and the purpose of the restraint. In this example, the
deed provided that the parties "and their heirs" covenanted not to partition the property
"forever". Obviously, this restraint against partition is for an unreasonably long period of
time and will not be enforceable. Note that choice  (B) is correct because the equity court
has judicial authority over partition proceedings. Thus, individual property owners cannot
override the jurisdiction of the equity court. Note that choice (A) is wrong because the
Rule Against Perpetuities does not apply to partition actions.

11.

(C) The doctrine of estoppel by deed (commonly referred to as the after-acquired prop-
erty doctrine) provides that when a person executes an instrument conveying a larger estate
than he has in land and subsequently acquires such larger estate, it inures by estoppel to the
benefit of the grantee. On the other hand, Smith and Boyer state that "if when a deed is made
it purports to convey only the interest which the grantor presently owns in the property, the
doctrine of estoppel by deed has no application and any after-aquired estate which comes to
the grantor may be kept by him free from the operation of the doctrine."  Real Property, pg.
322. Choice (C) is correct because Farnsworth transferred his entire 25% interest to Galloway
in 2006. As a result, the doctrine of estoppel by deed has no applicability to any after-aquired
property which comes to Farnsworth thereafter.

According to Smith and Boyer, ticket holders to baseball games, horse races, polo,

(C)	
hockey contests and other entertainment spectacles have only a mere license which is
always revocable.  A license simply permits one person to come onto land in the possession of
another without being a trespasser. Since a license is revocable, choice (C) is correct. There
is a minority view which holds that a ticket holder has a contract with the stadium owner. In
such situations, the contract right is specifically enforceable and the ticket holder has a right
to use self help in remaining on the land. However, this is the minority view and, thus, choice
(B) is not the best answer.

(D)	
A profit is the right of one person to go onto the land in possession of another and take
there from either some part of the land or some product of the land. It is necessary to know
that a profit is regarded as real property if (1) it is for an indefinite time like a fee simple
estate or (2) it is for the life of a human being. In these two situations, a holder of profit is
properly entitled to share in a condemnation award where his (or her) profit interest is extin-
guished by eminent domain. See Smith and Boyer, Real Property, pg. 383. Therefore, choice
(D) is correct. Note that answer (C) is wrong because the duration of the profit was for
Chard's lifetime, not Benji's.

14. (C)	

An easement by prescription  arises by adverse use of the servient tenement by the
dominant tenant for the period of the statute of limitations. To mature such an easement
against a landowner the use must be (a)  adverse  as distinct from permissive; in derogation of
right rather than in subordination to the rights of the landowner; and (b)  open and notorious,
and (c) continuous and without interruption, and (d)for the period of prescription.  See Smith
and Boyer, Law of Property, p. 387. Since Stein openly and notoriously used the northeast
portion of Hillacre to gain access to Grassacre for the 20-year period, as required by statute,
he obtained an easement by prescription. This easement passed on to Grich, who was in priv-
ity with Stein by means of the 2005 sales contract. Therefore, Grich's rights are enforceable
against the whole world and he will prevail against Erika. Choice (C) is the correct answer.

Types of Easements

a. Easements (or profits) may thus be created as follows:

(1)

(2)

(3)

by express provision in a deed or will;

by implication — which arises from the circumstances surrounding the dividing
by the owner of a piece of land into two pieces and conveying one of such pieces
to another. Easements by implication include: (A)  easements of necessity and (b)
easements created by conveyances in reference to a plat depicting streets, parks and
other places thereon;

by prescription — which arises by adverse use of the servient tenement by the
dominant tenant for the period of the statute of limitations. To mature such an ease-
ment, the use must be (as with adverse possession): (a) adverse as distinct from per-
missive, (b) open and notorious, (c) continuous and without interruption, and (d)
for the statutory period;

(4)

by estoppel;

(5) by eminent domain.

(C) An easement by implication arises from the circumstances surrounding the dividing
by the owner of a piece of land into two pieces and conveying one such piece to another. From
the surrounding circumstances an inference is drawn that the parties intend the creation of an
easement. Based upon this fact situation it may be assumed that Fegen intended to grant an
implied easement to Trump to allow the office workers and shoppers access to the walkway
connecting the two office buildings. As a consequence, the holder of an easement has the right
to do such affirmative acts on the servient tract as are necessary to the enjoyment thereof.
According to Smith and Boyer, Law of Property, pg. 396, "such right includes the right to
repair, maintain and improve the means by which the easement is made effective."

(A) Here is a Multistate example dealing with extinguishment of an easement by merger.
When an easement appurtenant exists and both the dominant and servient tenements come
under the ownership of the same person, the easement is terminated by operation of law. The
apparent rationale is that one cannot have an easement in his own property. Therefore, when
Bix (who was already the owner of Blackacre) acquired Whiteacre from Wing, the easement
in effect merged in his fee simple ownership of both properties.

(A) This is an example of an easement by implication. Students should note that an
implied easement is created and proved not by the words of the conveyance (it is  not express),
but by all the circumstances surrounding the execution of the conveyance. It is based upon the
intent of the parties. There are five prerequisites to the creation of an implied easement; (1)
there must be a quasi-easement; (2) there must be a conveyance of one part of the property
and a retention of another part of the property by the grantor; (3) the quasi-easement must be
apparent at the time of the easement; (4) the quasi-servient tenement must be permanently
adapted to serve the quasi-dominant tenement; and (5) the quasi-easement must be (a)  rea-
sonably necessary to the enjoyment of the quasi-dominant tenement if that tract is conveyed,
and (b) strictly necessary if the quasi-dominant tenement is retained by the grantor. Therefore,
since Dowd (the grantee) could reach the highway  either by crossing Blackacre or Greenacre,
she has satisfied the element of reasonable necessity.

(A) This same issue was tested two years ago on the MBE. A covenant is a contractual
obligation which is created in connection with the transfer of real property. As a general rule,
a covenant not only binds and benefits the original obligor and obligee, but will also "run
with the land" to be enforceable against successors in interest. Therefore, a covenant is the
best way to assure that each lot owner, even those who did not purchase from Aboo, will have
to make payments toward the projected operating deficit of the recreational facilities.

COVENANT RUNNING WITH
THE LAND

1. Is more than a mere personal contract but
is less than an easement because techni-
cally it is not an "interest in land."

2. Requirements: (a) there must be a
covenant, (b) an intention that the
covenant run with the land, (c) must
"touch and concern" the land and (d) priv-
ity of estate.

3. A covenant "touches and concerns" the
land if it makes the land in the hands of the
owner either more usable and more valu-
able or less usable and less valuable.

4. Legal effect: is to make an assignee of the
land either benefit by or be burdened by
the covenant without being party to the
making of the contract.

5. Remedies for breach: standard contract
remedies (i.e., money damages or specific
performance if appropriate).

EQUITABLE SERVITUDE

1. Is a restriction on the use of land enforce-

able in a court of equity.

2. Is more than a covenant running with the
land, because it is an interest in land.

3. Is broader than an equitable easement
because it applies not only to land but also
to chattel property such as a business.

4. Requirements: (a) may be created by a
writing complying with the Statute of
Frauds, (b) intention of the parties that
there be a restriction and (c) transferee
takes the land with either actual or con-
structive notice of the existence of the
servitude.

5. Privity of estate is not required.

6. Remedies: equitable remedies.

19.

20.

(A)	
Implied reciprocal servitudes were tested on the last three MBE exams. Here, Verde
can enforce the passive-solar house restriction as an implied reciprocal servitude which runs
with the last to bind Wilson. When a developer divides land into many different lots and sells
some of the lots via deeds that contain a restriction such as the passive-solar heat limitation,
then sells other lots not expressly subject to the restriction, the courts will enforce the restric-
tion on the subsequently sold lots on the theory that the developer impliedly intended for all
such lots to be subject to the restriction. The person seeking to enforce the implied reciprocal
servitude must show that there was a common plan or scheme.  In this case, evidence of the
common plan is shown by the recorded subdivision plan and by the fact that 200 of the 300
lots were sold with the restriction expressly contained in their deeds.

(C)	
Be aware that the Property questions on the MBE are the most onerous and diffi-
cult. During the last two years, the average mean score for Property on the MBE has been
only 17 correct (out of 33). One of the reasons the Property scores are so low is because
very obscure areas (such as percolating waters, fructus naturales crops, mortgages, riparian
water rights, etc.) are often tested. We strongly advise students to do all the PMBR
Multistate questions in the Workbook. From our experience, you can learn Property law
better by doing practice questions than by reading general outlines. With respect to this
particular question, it is necessary to proceed by process of elimination. Note that choices
(A) and (B) are clearly wrong because the question wants you to presume that the lot own-
ers will not prevail in their action to recover damages. In both eminent domain and inverse
condemnation proceedings,  just compensation must always be paid to the landowner.
Thus, if the lot owners fail in their suit to recover damages against the county, then obvi-

ously eminent domain and inverse condemnation are incorrect. Also, choice (D) is wrong
because an equitable servitude can be enforced against a buyer in a subdivision scheme
even though his deed does not necessarily contain the restriction. Whether or not a partic-
ular person can enforce an equitable servitude is determined by the intention of the parties.
Therefore, by process of elimination choice (C) must be correct.

(C)	
An assignee of a leasehold is in privity of estate with the landlord. Liability for rent
and for observing the other covenants that run with the leasehold can be based on privity
of estate as well as privity of contract. Smith and Boyer, Real Property, p. 149. Therefore,
a landlord can recover from the assignee rent obligations occurring while privity of estate
continues or until the assignee in turn assigns the leasehold. Dork, who has occupied the
premises for five months, will be liable for that rent accruing while he was Carr's
assignee-December, January, February, March and April—but not for any back rent during
Carr's tenancy. Choices (A) and  (B) are incorrect. In addition, the facts state that rent was
payable in advance on the first of each month. As a result, since Dork was in possession
on April 1, he will also be held liable for April's rental. Therefore, choice (C) is correct
because Dork will be liable for $5,000.

This is a rather straightforward Property question dealing with subleases. A sub-
(B)	
tenancy is where the tenant transfers his right of possession for a time shorter than the bal-
ance of the leasehold, so that he retains a reversion within the leasehold. Therefore, the
subtenant is neither in privity of estate nor privity of contract with the landlord. Lacking
privity, a subtenant is not liable to the landlord to pay rent. Choice  (B) is thus correct. Be
advised that choice (C) is incorrect because the fact that Tennace transferred "his entire
interest for two years" is a "red herring" intended to distract students into thinking that
Tennace made an assignment rather than a sublease. But a careful reading of the facts
would indicate that Tennace still had three years remaining in his leasehold. Thus, he
transferred a leasehold interest for a shorter term than what he still possessed.

(A)	
A very similar issue dealing with assigning and subleasing was recently tested on the
MBE. By definition an assignment occurs if the tenant transfers the entire estate, or the bal-
ance thereof, to the third party. If a lesser estate is conveyed so that the tenant retains an inter-
est in the leasehold, the transfer is properly classified a sublease. Since statement I covers a
sublease, it will be prohibited by the terms of the lease. Conversely, Hazelwood's friends had
a license (or mere permission) to use the lake for recreational purposes. Since a license is not
prohibited by the prohibitions in the lease, choice (A) is correct. Note that prohibitions against
assignment and sublease are strictly construed in real property law.

(A)	
At common law, since a tenant was deemed to receive an estate in land, his rights and
duties were treated as independent of the landlord's rights and duties. Thus, if the landlord
promised to keep the property in repair, a breach of this promise did not relieve the tenant
from the duty of paying rent. According to the common law rationale, the rent was owed as
payment for the estate and the promise to do repairs was merely a collateral promise which
could be enforced only by a separate contractual suit brought by the tenant. This doctrine is
generally referred to as the  independence of covenants.  As a result, choices (C) and (D) are
incorrect. Choice (B) is wrong because the reason the landlord will prevail is because the
premises were not uninhabitable (the basis for constructive eviction) rather than because the
tenant failed to perform the repainting himself. In other words, self-help is not an appropriate
remedy inasmuch as the tenant had no duty to make such repairs.

Here is another "trick" Multistate Property question dealing with termination of a
(D)	
periodic tenancy. In a month to month tenancy, a full month's notice must be given.  This
means that if Bobby wishes to terminate Lucia's tenancy in September, she may occupy the
apartment for one more full month  through the end of the month since she has paid
September rent. So, therefore, any notice of termination in September allows Lucia one more
full month of occupancy.

(C)	
A landlord impliedly warrants that the tenant will have a legal right to possession of
the premises at the beginning of the term. However, under the American view he does not have
an obligation to actually deliver possession to the tenant. On the other hand,  under English
law there is such an implied duty by the landlord to put the lessee in possession of the
premises.  Smith and Boyer, Survey of Property, 2d. Ed., p. 138-140. It is agreed that the
lease gives the tenant the legal right to possession, but the issue is whether the landlord
impliedly agrees to enforce such right against a trespasser or a holdover tenant. All the cases
agree that the tenant's exclusive remedy is against the wrongdoer and the tenant has no
remedy against the landlord. Applying the American rule, Farnsworth's only cause of action
would be the right to eject the tenant at sufferance, Sanchez. Choice (A) is incorrect, however,
because the question asks you to follow Anglo-Saxon case law.  Choice (C) is the best answer
since Hammer failed to deliver possession of the premises to Farnsworth.

Questions involving trade fixtures frequently appear on the bar exam.  Trade fixtures

(B)	
are chattels annexed to the land by a tenant for pecuniary gain during his tenancy. As a
general rule, trade fixtures are removable by the tenant unless accession occurs.  Regarding
the doctrine of accession, Smith and Boyer provide an example where a steel  "I" beam is built
into a structure. The beam thus becomes an accession to the property. As such, it loses its
identity as a trade fixture and is not removable.  Real Property, pg. 226. By analogy, the loft,
which is structurally attached to the main building, is viewed as an accession. Choice (B) is
therefore correct as all other chattels are trade fixtures and removable.

(B)	
The right of a landowner to have her land supported laterally by the neighboring land
is an absolute right inherent in the land itself. The right of lateral support means  the land in
its natural condition.  The right of lateral support does not include the right to have the addi-
tional weight of artificial structures supported. If there is damage to artificial structures, the
majority view is recovery is limited to damage to the land in its natural condition and  may not
include any damage to the artificial structures  on the land. This is called the American rule.
Note that if there is negligence on the part of the wrongdoer who removes lateral or subjacent
support, then the defendant is liable for all damages which proximately result, including dam-
ages to both the land and artificial structures. Choice (B) is thus correct.

(C)	
This question deals with the area of emblements, or fructus industriales.  Growing
crops are generally classified as personal property and will pass with a sale or mortgage of
the land. A purported sale of growing crops is considered to be a contract to sell the crops
when they come into existence. Maturity of the crop at the time of sale is not a controlling
factor. Burby, Real Property, pg. 16. Therefore, upon Winston's sale of his farm to
Raleigh, the growing tobacco crop will pass as personal property and Winston will not be
entitled to remove it. Choice (C) is correct.

30.

(D)	
Under riparian water rights  domestic use is superior to and is protected against com-
mercial or agricultural use. However, since this jurisdiction followed the  prior appropriation
doctrine,  choice (D) would be correct, based on the principle of "first in time, first in right."

Riparian Doctrine

Prior Appropriation Doctrine

1. THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THE
RIPARIAN DOCTRINE IS EQUALITY OF RIGHTS
AND REASONABLE USE—there is no priority of
rights, the reasonable use by each is limited by a like
reasonable use in every other riparian.

2. To be a riparian one needs only to be an owner of
riparian land. Riparian land is land which abuts or
touches the water of a lake or stream.

1. THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THE
PRIOR APPROPRIATION DOCTRINE IS FIRST IN
TIME IS FIRST IN RIGHT—there is no equality of
rights and no reasonable use limited by the rights of
others.

2. To be a prior appropriator one must do three things,
(a) have an intent to appropriate water, (b) divert the
water from the source of supply and (c) put such water
to a beneficial use.

3. Riparian lands are lands within the watershed. Under
the natural flow theory a riparian cannot use water on
non-riparian lands, that is, beyond the watershed from
which the water cannot return to the stream from
which it is taken. Under the reasonable use theory a
riparian may use water on non-riparian lands if such
use is reasonable.

4. Under the riparian doctrine the use of water for  nat-
ural purposes is paramount and takes precedence over
the use of water for artificial purposes. Natural uses
include domestic purposes for the household and
drink, stock watering and irrigating the garden.
Artificial purposes include use of irrigation, power,
mining, manufacturing and industry.

3.

4.

The prior appropriator may use the appropriated water
on riparian and on non-riparian lands alike. The char-
acter of the land is quite immaterial.

The prior appropriation doctrine makes no distinction
between uses of water for natural wants and for artifi-
cial and industrial purposes.

31.

32.

(C)	
In order to acquire title to property by adverse possession, the possession must be:  (1)
exclusive; (2) open and notorious (meaning not secret or clandestine); (3) continuous and
peaceable (meaning without interruption); and (4) hostile and adverse (meaning without
the dispossessed owner's permission).  The period of adverse possession of one possessor can
be "tacked" to the period of adverse possession of another possessor when there is privity
between the two. It is important to point out that this Multistate question does not involve
tacking. Rather, during the period of adverse possession, the adverse possessor entered into a
lease agreement with the owner. Note that the two year lease was with the owner's permis-
sion. So, therefore the possession during the leasehold was not adverse or hostile.
Consequently, choice (C) is correct.

(C)	
Choice (C) is correct because Haddox's possession was (1) actual and exclusive, (2)
open, visible and notorious (not secret or clandestine, but rather occupying as a true owner),
(3) continuous (without abandonment or a physical hiatus in occupancy), (4)  hostile and
adverse, and (5) for the statutory period. The key element in this question is  "hostile" and
"adverse." Under the majority view, it is generally stated that the adverse possesor must
intend to hold adversely against the whole world, including the rightful owner, but the really
significant fact is that he  hold against the rights of the legal owner  (i.e., in derogation of, not
in subordination to, the rights of the legal owner). Boyer,  Survey of The Law of Property,
3rd Edition, pg. 241. The motives of the adverse possessor are irrelevant. Whether he intends
a wrongful disseisin or whether he occupies what he believes to be his own, he aquires title,
since it is the visible and adverse possession with intent to possess that constitutes its adverse
character, not the remote views or mistaken belief of the possessor.  Schertz v. Rundles,  363
N.E. 2d 203 (1977). It is clear that Haddox intended to possess the tennis court believing that
it was his own property. Therefore, since Haddox's possession was both adverse and hostile,
Virdon will not prevail in an action for encroachment. Haddox has obtained title to the three-
foot strip by adverse possession. Choice (C) is correct.

(C)	
Under the unity of possession, each co-tenant is entitled to possess and enjoy the
whole of the property subject to the equal right of his (or her) co-tenant. If one tenant  wrong-
fully  excludes another co-tenant from possession of the whole or any part of the whole prop-
erty, such conduct amounts to an ouster. Here, choice (C) is correct because there is no
evidence that Arthur was wrongfully excluding Celia from Goodacre. Note that choice (D) is
wrong because Burby points out that "possession may become adverse if the co-tenants are
excluded from possession (i.e., ouster) or if the co-tenants are specifically notified of the
adverse claim or can be charged with notice because of the acts of the possessor."  Real
Property, pg. 232

(C)	
This is a classic Multistate Property example where a substantial number of students
will incorrectly choose choice (D). The test maker knows that many students will be led
astray by viewing this as a trespass-type question. In trespass, of course, the plaintiff is enti-
tled to relief if he (or she) shows an intentional unprivileged entry. If he (or she) does so, the
plaintiff is then entitled at least to nominal damages and possibly an injunction prohibiting
further trespass. This example, however, does not really deal with the issue of trespass.
Rather, what we have here is a  boundary line agreement between Mays and Mantle. As a gen-
eral rule, judicial recognition is extended to boundary line agreements even if not executed
with the formalities prescribed by the Statute of Frauds. Burby notes that application of the
doctrine usually requires proof that the parties were not informed as to the true boundary line,
that there was an express or implied agreement as to its location, and possession that con-
formed to the agreement. As such, Snider's (i.e., the grantee's) proper cause of action is not
against Mays for trespass, but rather it is against Mantle (the grantor) for breach of the pre-
sent covenant against encumbrances. Burby,  Real Property, pg. 310.

35. (D)	

This same Property area involving metes and bounds was tested two years ago on
the MBE. The reason why many students were confused was because the land could not
be identified in a square or rectangular configuration where the property lines run north,
east, south and west. Rather, the property lines extended southeast and northwest. As such,
the diagram below will identify the shape of the property being conveyed. The last call is
clearly incorrect. The 4th call should have said "thence north at a 90° angle  east 50 feet."
Since the deed fails to enclose a bounded area, it will fail for indefiniteness. Choice (D) is
the best answer.

(D) In a tenancy in common, the only unity is that of possession. Each tenant owns an
undivided fractional part of the property. Upon the death intestate of a tenant in common his
interest descends to his heirs. There is no right of survivorship. Although choices (C) and (D)
are technically both correct, the latter is preferred because it addresses the Statute of Frauds
issue that was raised in the fact situation. The facts state that Taylor and Scott made an oral
agreement regarding the transfer of their interest in the property upon death. According to the
Statute of Frauds, an oral agreement relating to the transfer of an interest in land must be in
writing in order to be enforceable. Thus, the verbal agreement is unenforceable.

(C) Always remember, a contract for the sale or transfer of an interest in land comes
within the Statute of Frauds and must be in writing to be enforceable. In determining the cor-
rect legal advice to give Mann, statements I and II express the opinion that the oral land con-
tract is specifically enforceable. Since specific performance will  not be decreed, choices (A),
(B) and (D) are incorrect. In the overwhelming majority of states, equity will decree specific
performance of an oral land contract, despite the Statute of Frauds, only where there has been
substantial part performance (i.e., taking possession of the property and paying part of the
purchase price). Moreover, the taking of possession together with other acts normally to be
performed by a buyer (e.g., payment of taxes or interest on the mortgage) have been held to
justify specific performance. However, it is well established that payment of the price
alone is not sufficient part performance,  unless possession has been delivered and taken
thereunder.

38. (B) Delivery of a deed to real property, being the state of mind of the grantor, means  the
intention of the grantor that the deed shall operate as a conveyance.  To effectuate such a
conveyance, title will pass to the grantee if there be a physical deed and the grantor intends it
to operate as a conveyance, even if the grantor retains possession of the physical paper on
which the deed is written. It is not material whether the physical deed is in the possession of
the grantee, the grantor, or a third person. Smith and Boyer,  Real Property, p. 280, 294. Daisy
clearly intended to make a present, inter vivos conveyance to Bessie and Sylvester with no
reservation of rights. Her  execution of the warranty deed plus her intent that it be operative
as a conveyance of the ski chalet (which is further emphasized by her attached note) consti-
tute an effective delivery. Title thereby passed to Bessie and Sylvester at the time of execu-
tion. Upon Bessie's death, Sylvester would then take her joint tenancy interest by right of
survivorship and hold title to the ski chalet in severalty. Choice  (B) is correct. Neither Bessie's
heir, Blake, nor Daisy's heir, Dottie, have any interest.

39. (B) A forged deed is a nullity and cannot be the foundation for a claim of title by any sub-
sequent purchaser who traces her chain of title to that deed. Thus, although Midas searched the
title records (through his agent, Titleco) and purchased the property in good faith, he will not
be protected under the recording act. Furthermore, the warranty deed from Osaka to Larsen
was "undelivered" because there was no present intent to pass title until the condition of grad-
uation from college was satisfied. Title remains in Osaka. Choice (B) is correct. MBE Exam
Tip: Remember the three ways conveyances are commonly invalidated on the bar exam are
by means of (1) unrecorded deeds; (2) forged deeds; and (3) non-delivery of deeds.

40. (B) The doctrine of equitable conversion acts as a risk allocator in land sale contract sit-
uations. In its original application, the doctrine treats the purchaser in a land sale contract as
the owner of the property from the moment the contract is signed, even if legal title will not
pass until closing. Thus, if the subject property is damaged while the escrow is pending, the
purchaser bears the loss. This application of the doctrine has been subject to much criticism,

pooh.*

MULTISTATE SPECIALIST

PROPERTY

and some jurisdictions have rejected it, placing the risk of loss during such a period on the
seller until either (1) the purchaser takes possession of the property (when she would pre-
sumably realize she needed to insure it) or (2) when legal title passes. This rule, known as the
Uniform Vendor and Purchaser's Risk Act,  best supports the trial court's decision in favor of
Bracero—that he was not in possession and thus did not bear the risk of loss. Choice (A) is
not the best choice. The presence of insurance covering a loss affecting property involved in
a land sale contract is not irrelevant; most courts will not permit a party to use the doctrine of
equitable conversion to reap a windfall if they do not bear the risk of loss yet receive insur-
ance proceeds as to the subject property. However, where there is no insurance, the courts do
not consider its absence in deciding whether to apply the doctrine of equitable conversion,
The party bearing the risk of loss suffers precisely because his lack of insurance is not taken
into account. This is one of the major criticisms of equitable conversion—it shifts the risk of
loss to the buyer, who is less likely to have insurance on property as to which he does not yet
consider himself the owner. Choice (C) is incorrect. As indicated above, if the doctrine of equi-
table conversion were given its normal application, the risk of flood loss would fall on Bracero,
and he would not be entitled to rescind the contract due to the damage which occurred to the
property before closing. Choice (D) is inaccurate. The trade fixtures doctrine, which pertains
to landlord-tenant situations where the tenant wishes to remove improvements the tenant made
which have been attached to the leasehold, has no application to this situation.

41.

42.

43.	

(A)	
Under equitable conversion the purchaser is regarded as the "equitable" owner of
the land although legal title remains with the seller. In the absence of a contract provision
to the contrary, the weight of authority applies the equitable conversion doctrine and
shifts the risk of loss to the vendee for casualty losses which occur during the existence
of the vendor-vendee relationship.  By the same token, the doctrine also "shifts the ben-
efits to the purchaser as well". Real Estate Transactions, Burke, pg. 45. With regard to
the shifting of benefits, Burke points out that if minerals are discovered on the property
during the executory period, the person bearing the risk of loss should in fairness also
receive the benefits of the appreciation in value. In like manner, since the property appre-
ciated in value during the executory period as a result of the condemnation, Vendee will
be entitled to the appreciation in value. Therefore, choice (A) is correct.

(C)	
The obligation of the seller is to provide "good" and "marketable" title to the buyer
at the time set for closing. Existing land use restrictions do not render title unmarketable (as
opposed to zoning restrictions enacted between the time of the sales contract and the time of
closing). Since the Aparicio-Fox contract was mutually enforceable and not conditioned on
Fox's intended use, there was no failure of consideration. Therefore, specific performance by
Aparicio, the seller, will be granted. Choice (D) is incorrect because Fox's defense is barred
by the parol evidence rule, not the Statute of Frauds. By process of elimination, choice (C) is
correct.

(D)	
In the area of conveyancing, questions dealing with marketable title frequently are
tested on the MBE. A similar issue was tested on both administrations of the MBE three years
ago! In a contract for the sale of land, where either an express or an implied contract provi-
sion calls for conveyance of marketable title, the time at which such  marketable title must be
conveyed is at the closing of escrow.  In this respect, the seller is entitled to rely upon the pro-
ceeds of sale to retire an outstanding encumbrance which could otherwise render title unmar-
ketable. Choice (D) is thus correct because Oatbran may apply the proceeds from the sale to
remove the tax lien in order to render title marketable.

(C)	
The "key" to this question is carefully interpreting the wording of the recording statute.
According to the statutory language, the Runnymede recording act protects subsequent bona
ride purchasers for value and without notice. As such, this is an example of a pure "notice" type
recording statute which generally provides, "an unrecorded conveyance or other instrument is
invalid as against a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value and without notice." Under this
type of recording statute, the subsequent bona fide purchaser prevails over the prior interest
whether the subsequent purchaser records or not. As a consequence, Fong will prevail over
Eto because Fong was a subsequent bona fide purchaser without notice of Eto's deed.

This is an extremely tricky Property Multistate question dealing with recording
(C)	
statutes. Firstly, choice (A) is wrong because the conveyance will take precedence over the
will provision. A deed effectively transfers title to property after there has been a valid
delivery. The facts indicate that a valid delivery occurred. Not only did Bergman intend for
the deed to be effective, but it was also duly recorded. Next, choice (B) is wrong because a
recital of consideration such as "for value received" is sufficient to support a valid con-
veyance. Even if a consideration is not recited in the deed, the conveyance will be sustained if
there is proof that a consideration was, in fact, paid. Be advised that courts generally do not
take into account the amount of consideration. Thus, a nominal consideration of $10 will be
deemed to be valid. Now it gets "tricky" choosing between (C) and (D). Note that (C) "trumps"
(D) because it is irrelevant whether Emerson recorded the deed because  only bona fide pur-
chasers are protected under recording acts. Donees, heirs and devisees are not protected
because they do not give value for their interests. Since Dixie is a devisee, she is not protected
under the recording statute. Emerson will prevail regardless of whether he recorded or not.

(B)	
A key  testing area on the Multistate deals with mortgages. Keep in mind that the
difference between a transfer of the mortgage property "subject to" and "assuming" the mort-
gage is the difference between personal liability and the lack thereof on behalf of the grantee.
In a conveyance of land "subject to" a mortgage, the grantee is not personally liable for the
debt which the mortgage secures. Conversely, in a sale of land in which the purchaser
"assumes the mortgage," the purchaser or grantee is personally liable for the mortgage debt.
Since Davis "assumed the mortgage," he is personally liable; therefore, choice (B) is correct.
See Figure 1.

47.

(C)	
As indicated above, in order for the grantee-Davis to be personally liable to the mort-
gagee, the former must "assume the mortgage." Thus, in this situation where the  deed instru-
ment makes no reference to the mortgage,  the grantee does not assume the mortgage and is
not liable to the mortgagee. See Figure 2.

A similar issue dealing with purchase money mortgages was tested on the MBE last
summer. In a majority of states  purchase money mortgages take priority over other mort-
gages which have been executed prior to or simultaneously with the purchase money mort-
gage. Since purchase money mortgages take priority over all previously recorded mortgage
instruments, choice (D) is correct because recording statutes are irrelevant. As a general rule,
recording statutes give priority to (prior) recorded instruments (such as deeds, mortgages and
assignments). But a purchase money mortgage "trumps" previous claims (whether recorded
or not recorded) on the property. Another variation frequently tested on the Multistate deals
with priority between a purchase money mortgage and an after-acquired property clause in a
previously executed mortgage. Osborne notes that purchase money mortgages generally take
priority over after-acquired property interests as well.  Mortgages, pg. 389.

Mortgage questions now constitute the "hottest" new area that is being tested on
(C)	
the MBE. The Examiners are keying into mortgages because this is one area of law that
the general bar review courses often cover inadequately during their substantive law lec-
tures. In this regard, students must be familiar with  exoneration. One who personally
stands as surety, or whose interest in mortgaged property occupies that position, is enti-
tled to exoneration against the person or property primarily bound to pay the debt.
Moreover, Osborne in his hornbook on Mortgages states that "such persons also, if it will
not prejudice the rights of the mortgage creditor or third parties, may compel the mortgage
creditor to enforce his claim against the person or property primarily liable." Choice (C)
is thus correct because once Lemke conveyed the property to Biddle (who "assumed the
mortgage" by promising to repay it), he became secondarily liable as surety. Therefore, the
mortgagee must first proceed against either the property or Biddle (who is primarily liable)
before asserting its rights against Lemke.

(C)	 With respect to the foreclosure issue, Smith and Burby state that "junior incum-
brancers must be made parties to a foreclosure action in order to have their claims elimi-
nated." Law of Property, pg. 346. Therefore, despite the fact that Center City Bank obtained
a foreclosure decree, Singer's rights as a junior incumbrancer would not be compromised
because he was not made a party to the action. Note that the facts clearly state that the bank
"failed to join Singer" in its foreclosure action. Secondly, the bank's foreclosure would  not
bar Singer's equity of redemption. In an overwhelming majority of states (those following
"lien theory") a foreclosure does not extinguish a mortgagor's redemption right. Therefore,
choice (C) most correctly states Singer's available remedies. Note that a minority of states
("title theory" states) follow strict foreclosure rules whereby a foreclosure action literally
forecloses or bars the equity of redemption.

Contracts. An agreement between two or m
which creates an obligation to do or not to do
thing. Its essentials are competent parties, subjc
legal consideration, mutuality of agreement, an
of obligation. Lamoureaux v. Burrillville Racii

Perhaps the most difficult Contracts questions deal with the area of contract formation
(B)	
(i.e., offer, acceptance, and consideration). Under  Restatement of Contracts 2d,  §24, "An
offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another
person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it." Upon
careful analysis of the facts, Taylor's letter to James, Kate, and Livingston does not qualify as
an offer. An offer must evidence a commitment by the offeror that he reasonably intends to
be bound upon acceptance by the offeree, rather than a mere statement of present intention
or preliminary negotiations. This determination is often difficult to make. Generally, such
equivocal language as "I am asking..." or "I quote you..." is construed as inviting an offer.
Taylor's letter stated "I will let you have [the tickets] for a reasonable price." This language
evidences an intention to invite a reasonable offer. Furthermore, at common law, material
terms such as subject matter, identity of the offeree, and  price had to be definite and certain
in order for an offer to be valid. Therefore, Taylor's letter is not an offer. On the other hand,
James' letter is an offer which Taylor chose not to accept. Kate's offer is also valid and, in this
case, Taylor accepted it upon dispatch of his telegram on February 24. Therefore, James will
not prevail against Taylor. Answer choice (B) is thus correct.

4. Supervening illegality

e. Inquiry (Note: A mere inquiry does

(B) In light of the previous discussion, Kate's letter to Taylor on February 22 constituted
a valid offer. Taylor accepted the offer by telegram the next day and has a valid cause of action
to recover the $700 contract price for the tickets.  Restatement of Contracts 2d,  §50, states
that (1) Acceptance of an offer is a manifestation of assent to the terms thereof made by the
offeree in a manner invited or required by the offer." Choice (B) is correct. Choice (A) is
wrong because it incorrectly labels Kate's bid as an acceptance of Taylor's offer.

(A) The duration of an offer which states no time limit for acceptance is a reasonable
time. The factors determining a reasonable time are:  (1) the subject matter of the offer;
(2) its rate of price fluctuation; (3) the period within which the offeror's known purpose
in inducing the contract can be effectuated; and, of lesser importance, (4) the mode of
communication of the offer. Undoubtedly, certain offers (such as those involving stock
purchases) have a short life expectancy due to ever changing market fluctuations. Thus, a

pstabse

bid on the floor of a stock exchange in an active market will create a power of acceptance
lasting only a few minutes. Similarly, under the "face-to-face" conversation rule, an offer
expires at the conclusion of a face-to-face conversation (unless there is an acceptance).

(C) There are no magic words required to extend an offer, but all offers contain three
elements: (1) an expression of intent to enter a present contract; (2) a sufficient articula-
tion of the essential terms of the proposed bargain; and (3) communication of that intent
and those terms to another person (the offeree) who has the capacity to form a contract by
a timely and conforming acceptance. This Contracts question deals with the revival of an
offer. If, in the wake of a rejection/counter-offer, the offeror remanifests an intention to
trade on the terms of the original offer, that offer is once again open to an acceptance by
the offeree. Choice (C) is correct because Chad's statement "Why don't you think it over
until tomorrow?" revived the original offer. It is also important to note that Barney's
acceptance by telephone would be effective even though the offer was by a different
medium. According to UCC 2-206, "an offer to make a contract shall be construed as
inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium that is reasonable under the
circumstances."

(D) According to Restatement Section 39, "A counter-offer is an offer relating to the
same matter as the original offer and proposing a substituted bargain differing from that pro-
posed by the original offer." Be advised that an  offeree's power of acceptance is terminated
by his making of a counter-offer. Since Plummer's reply letter of March 15th constituted a
counter-offer, his power of acceptance was terminated. Therefore, Plummer's March 20th
letter did not have any legal effect.

(A) This is an extremely "tricky" Contracts question dealing with contract formation relat-
ing to shipment of goods. An order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment
normally invites acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by prompt or current ship-
ment. According to UCC Section 2-206(1)(b), if non-conforming goods are shipped, the
shipment is an acceptance and at the same time a breach.  On the contrary, there is no accep-
tance if the offeror has reason to know that none is intended, as, for example, where the
offeree promptly notifies him that non-conforming goods are being shipped and are offered
only as an accommodation to him. Since Dell did not indicate that the shipment was being
offered for accommodation purposes, it will be regarded as an acceptance (and a simultane-
ous breach).

(D) Approximately 12 of the 34 Contracts questions will cover formation. This same issue
involving "cross offers" was tested last year. The first requisite of a contract is that the parties
manifest their mutual assent to the same bargain. Normally, this will take the form of an offer
and acceptance. Knowledge of the offer by the offeree is essential to acceptance. In cases
involving cross offers, neither offer accepts the other. Since there is no true acceptance,
mutuality of assent is lacking despite the fact that the cross offers contain identical terms. See
Restatement of Contracts  Section 23 for the same illustration on pg. 69.

8. (B) An offer which invites performance of an act as acceptance, rather than a return
promise, becomes irrevocable as soon as the offeree has started to perform the act.  This rule
is deemed essential to prevent hardship to the offeree where his part performance does not
benefit the offeror and so would give him no recovery in quasi-contract. Students should be
advised that although some of the older decisions have applied the logical view that a unilat-
eral offer may be revoked at any time prior to full completion of the act bargained for, by the
majority rule today such an offer becomes irrevocable as soon as the offeree has started to per-
form the act requested. It is important to note that part of the actual performance requested
must have been given in order to render the offer irrevocable. Mere preparation for perfor-
mance, no matter how detrimental to the offeree, will not affect the offeror's power and priv-
ilege to revoke a unilateral offer. In the present example, Tex went beyond mere preparation

inasmuch as he had already saddled Barnum's bronco and he was mounting the horse when
Barnum attempted to revoke. Note choice (A) is wrong because completion of performance is
no longer required to make a unilateral offer irrevocable. Choice (C) is incorrect because the
doctrine of promissory estoppel (or estoppel in pais) applies in situations where the promisee
detrimentally relies on a gratuitous promise made by the promisor. Here, Barnum, the
promisor, did not make a gratuitous promise; he proposed a unilateral contract. Lastly, choice
(D) is wrong because Tex's part performance did not benefit Barnum.

(B) As noted in the previous question, once Tex started to perform then Barnum's offer
became irrevocable. Here, by riding the horse for a full minute, Tex has performed the
requested act. Thus, a contract was formed prior to Barnum's attempted revocation.
Consequently, Barnum is liable for breach of contract if he fails to pay Tex $500 as agreed.

(D) This Multistate example deals with revocation of an offer. As a general rule, the
offeror may at any time before acceptance terminate her offer by revoking it. This is true even
though the offeror has promised not to revoke for a stated time, unless the promise is sup-
ported by consideration. Revocation takes effect only when communicated to the offeree.
This is true even when the offeree learns through a third party that the offeror is no longer
willing to enter into the proposed contract. By the same token,  Restatement of Contracts 2d,
Section 43, states that "an offeree's power of acceptance is terminated when the offeror takes
definite action inconsistent with an intention to enter into the proposed contract and the
offeree acquires reliable information to that effect." Choice (D) is therefore correct because
the revocation took effect when Martin learned of Donner's sale of the stamp collection in the
newspaper article. Note that choice (B) is incorrect because a stamp collector apparently is not
viewed as a merchant. Consequently, UCC Section 2-205 (the "firm offer" rule) is not
applicable.

(C) In bilateral contracts the acceptance consists of the offeree's manifesting his assent by
giving to the offeror the return promise he bargained for. Acceptance is not complete and the
offeror may revoke until the return promise is communicated by the means authorized.
Simpson, Contracts, 2d. Ed., pp. 51-52. In this question, Dealer's written offer expressly
stated, "If you accept, please notify me by Friday." The authorized means of acceptance was
Dealer's receiving notice by Friday. When Collector mailed his acceptance on Wednesday the
purported acceptance was ineffective because the offeror had bargained for a return promise
of notice to be communicated. Therefore, the "mailbox rule" rationale in Choice (A) is incor-
rect. Choice (D) is also incorrect because no assurances were given to trigger the "firm offer"
rule. Since the offer was not irrevocable, Dealer's revocation on Thursday was effective.
Choice (C) is the correct answer.

(B) In the area of contract formation, students are frequently tested on the distinction
between bargained-for consideration (choice A) and conditional gift promises made binding
by reliance (choice B). Promises are legally enforceable where the promisee has relied on the
promise to his injury, even though the reliance was not bargained for. In other words, sub-
stantial and detrimental action induced by a gratuitous promise affords a reason for enforce-
ment of the promise without a bargained-for consideration. In this regard, Simpson states that
"a promisor who invites his nephew to take a trip to Europe or to undertake a college educa-
tion by promising reimbursement for expenses incurred should not, after the action in reliance
is completed, be permitted to escape fulfillment of his promise on the ground that it was one
to made a gift." Contracts, pg. 113. Choice (B) is therefore correct because LeRoy attended
Princeton rather than Rutgers in reliance on Uncle Reggie's promise to pay his first year
tuition. Clearly, there is justification for enforcement of the promise without bargained-for consid-
eration due to the fact that LeRoy would be required to pay $20,000 more in tuition by attend-
ing Princeton instead of Rutgers the first year. Conversely, it is necessary to distinguish this
situation with the well-known case of an uncle  who promised to pay his nephew $5,000 if the

nephew refrained from "drinking, using tobacco," etc., until he was twenty-one. The nephew
fulfilled his uncle's requirements and the court held there was sufficient consideration to sup-
port a contract. Although no economic benefit had been received by the uncle, nonetheless
there was evidence that he was bargaining for his nephew to conduct himself in accordance
with his wishes. In conclusion, this is an important distinction that is frequently tested on the
Multistate and ultimately the question will depend on interpreting whether the promisor
intended to make a gift promise or enter into a bargained-for exchange with the promisee.

(D) When a general contractor, about to submit a bid on a construction project, secures a
bid from a subcontractor for a definite part of the proposed work, and uses the bid to deter-
mine that part of his cost, he often finds after the principal contract is let to him that the sub-
contractor refuses to go through with the job. He must then find another to do the job, usually
at a price much higher than the promised figure. Can he recoup his loss from the defaulting
subcontractor? Yes, the subcontractor is bound under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
Thus, a promisor who induces substantial change of position by the promisee in reliance on
the promise is estopped to deny its enforceability as lacking consideration. The reason for the
doctrine is to avoid an unjust result. Choice (D) is therefore correct because  Restatement of
Contracts, 2d, Section 87(2) provides: "An offer which the offeror should reasonably expect
to induce action or forbearance of a substantial character on the part of the offeree before
acceptance and which does induce such action or forbearance is  binding as an option con-
tract to the extent necessary to avoid injustice."

(C) Under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, Calamari states that  "a promise which the
promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and sub-
stantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or for-
bearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by the enforcement of the promise."
Contracts, pg. 249. Here, promissory estoppel would provide Cox with the strongest argu-
ment to specifically enforce the exercise of her option to purchase the property. Moreover,
specific performance is an appropriate remedy because the law views property as unique given
the fact that no two parcels of land are regarded as the same. Choice (A) is incorrect because
if Cox did not pay the consideration, then LeGrand wouldn't be in material breach for failing
to honor the option. Choice (B) is wrong because it is the payment, not acknowledgement, of
the consideration that renders the option irrevocable. Alternative (D) is wrong because parol
evidence is admissible to show lack or want of consideration.

(B) Modifications made under the UCC must meet the  test of good faith. If Clutz acted
in bad faith, then the modification would be ineffective and unenforceable. Choice (B) is
correct. Note that (A) is wrong because consideration is not required to support a modifi-
cation under the UCC. Choice (C) is not the best answer because a contract (or modifica-
tion) that does not satisfy the statute of frauds is enforceable with respect to goods that
have been received and accepted. Choice (D) is wrong because it addresses UCC 2-207
language that covers the issue of contract formation. This question centers on the enforce-
ability of a modification, not whether a contract had been formed.

(B) This Contracts fact pattern deals with a personal services contract providing for office
cleaning services for one year. Common law principles—not UCC rules—will therefore
apply. Except where there is an express provision against oral modification, or circumstances
where the Statute of Frauds applies, any contract can be modified or rescinded by the  oral
agreement of the parties, even if the original contract is in writing. See Simpson,  Contracts,
p. 187. However, "Modifying agreements being themselves contracts must be supported by
consideration. If they change the duties only on one side, leaving the duty on the other the
same as under the former contract, they are unenforceable."  Ibid., p. 188. However, a promise
for a new or different performance  (such as by altering the time, character, or nature of the
duties) will overcome the "preexisting duty" rule and serve as valid consideration.  Thus,

Night Owl's promise to perform the cleaning  on Sunday, rather than Wednesday, is suffi-
cient, bargained-for consideration for Molar's promise to pay an additional $500.

(B)	
This same issue dealing with the  pre-existing duty rule  was tested last winter.
According to Calamari, it does not constitute legal detriment when a party performs an act
which he or she is legally obligated to do. In this question, Jewell was hired by the insurance
company to investigate the theft. Since he had a pre-existing duty to perform this service, his
promise to Daisy was not supported by consideration and therefore unenforceable.

(D)	
It is generally accepted that mutual mistake as to the existence of the subject matter
is always ground for avoidance of a contract. The difficulty lies in determining what is the
subject matter. It may be an object, as where A finds a pretty stone and sells it to B for one
dollar, and unknown to both A and B it later turns out to an uncut diamond worth one thou-
sand dollars. A may not rescind and recover the stone. The only mistake was as to the value
of the object, not as to its existence. On the other hand, not the object, but its rare quality, may
be the subject matter, as where A sells to B a stone for two thousand dollars, both of them
thinking it to be a diamond, and it turns out to be a zircon, worth about five dollars. B may
rescind and recover the price paid, on the ground of mutual mistake as to the existence of the
violin as an "original Stradivarius." Therefore, the contract is voidable by Player.

ings to their manifestations and (a) neither party knows or has reason to know the meaning
attached by the other; or (b)  each party knows or each party has reason to know the
meaning attached by the other." Choice (A) is correct because if Benjamin Moore's rep-
resentative, Betty Morgan, referred to Aaron's "long established business" during the
course of their sales negotiations, then Aaron  had reason to know of Morgan's misunder-
standing. If this is true, there is no contract due to lack of mutual assent.

(D) This question deals with the validity of oral assignments. According to  Restatement
of Contracts, 2d, Section 324, "It is essential to an assignment of a right that the obligee
manifest an intention to transfer the right to another person without further action or mani-
festation of intention by the obligee. The manifestation may be made to the other or to a third
person on his behalf and...may be made either orally or by a writing." As a result,
Spendthrift's oral assignment is valid and thus irrevocable. On the other hand, it is important
to point out that oral gratuitous assignments may be revocable.

(A) As a general rule,  all contracts are assignable and delegable except personal service
contracts and long-term requirement contracts. Even though there may be an anti-
assignment provision in a contract, it does not prevent the assignor from assigning his rights.
When an assignor makes an assignment in violation of an anti-assignment clause, the assign-
ment is valid. However, the obligor does have a cause of action against the assignor for breach
of contract, but ordinarily damages will be nominal.

(D) This Multistate Contracts example deals with warranties of an assignor. According
to Restatement 2d, Section 333, "Unless a contrary intention is manifested, one who
assigns or purports to assign a right by assignment under seal or for value warrants to the
assignee (a) that he will do nothing to defeat or impair the value of the assignment, and
(b) that the right, as assigned, actually exists and is subject to no limitations or defenses
good against the assignor other than those stated or apparent at the time of the assign-
ment." In other words, in an assignment for value the assignor impliedly warrants to his
assignee that the claim is genuine and legally enforceable. Based on this rule,  I.B.M., the
assignor, impliedly warranted to Klewel, the assignee, that Telecomp would perform the
installation work. Otherwise, the claim (i.e., Klewel's right to payment of the $80,000
from Prudential) will not be collectible. Note that choice (C) is wrong because in an
assignment the assignor does not act as a surety in guaranteeing the amounts due under the
contract.

(C) True contracts are those in which the parties' obligation(s) arise from actual agree-
ment and intent. If the agreement or mutual assent is manifested in words (oral or written), the
contract is said to be "express." On the other hand, where the mutual undertaking of the par-
ties is inferred from their conduct alone, without spoken or written words, the contract is said
to be "implied in fact." In this hypo, Deke was present while Desmond received the golf
lessons from Snead. Even though the parties did not expressly enter into an agreement with
respect to Desmond, it is clear from their conduct that an "implied in fact" contract was
created. Note that choice (D) is wrong because it addresses quasi-contractual relief. In a
quasi-contract the parties do not have a contract and the court constructs one to avoid
unjust enrichment. Here, the parties have entered into a contract by their conduct.

(D) The traditional view is that equitable relief will be denied unless the matter is one in
which the plaintiff's remedy at law is inadequate. There is no general formula for determin-
ing when a legal remedy is inadequate. As a general rule, however, equitable relief will be
granted in the following situations: (1) when the plaintiff is deprived of something to which
she is entitled and cannot obtain it in the market; (2) the defendant acts in such a way that the
plaintiff may be required to bring more than one suit to effectuate her legal remedy; (3) the
plaintiff is entitled either to money or certain performance by the defendant but the defendant
is insolvent and it is not collectible; or (4) the plaintiff is entitled to damages at law but under
the facts damages are so speculative that any award is likely to be inadequate. Here, Dominic
and Georgia entered into reciprocal agreements promising to leave their entire estates to each
other with the residual to their daughter. Since the parties agreed not to make any testamen-
tary changes in their wills, Dominic's estate has the right to specifically enforce that provision.

(C) It is universally agreed that the employer may not force an employee to work by
means of specific performance. The rationale behind this rule is twofold: (I) money damages
are generally available and (2) it is impossible for courts to properly supervise employment
contracts. Once again remember that the "key" to success on the MBE is reading comprehen-
sion. Here, the question states that this is a suit for specific performance. Thus, choice (C) is
the best answer. Note that choice (B) is a good answer but (C) is preferred because it states
the proper remedy is at law for money damages.

26. (D) Choice (D) is correct because specific performance is available to enforce a contract
for the sale of a unique item of personal property. Here, the subject matter of the contract
(the Ralphio recording) was the only known recording of its kind. As such, Crooner would be
entitled to specific performance of the contract. The condition of certification by Prof.
Erickson was excused by Collette's conduct when she falsely told Prof. Erickson that the
recording was a fake and thus the failure of the condition to occur would not preclude enforce-
ment of the contract.

(C) Choice (C) is the best choice because Collette's best defense to a breach of contract
action asserted by Crooner would be to establish that  the condition precedent to her duty to
perform (certification by Prof. Erickson) had not been satisfied or excused.  If Prof. Erickson
was given the opportunity to inspect the recording and determined that it was not a genuine
Ralphio recording, then neither party would be obligated to perform under the contract.

(C) This is a really clever Multistate question dealing with liability of a minor for neces-
saries. It is well established that a minor is liable for necessaries furnished him, and it is
generally recognized that this liability is quasi-contractual rather than contractual. As a
consequence of the quasi-contractual nature of the action, the infant may disaffirm an
executory contract for necessaries. Moreover, the infant is not liable for the contract price, but
for the reasonable value of the necessaries furnished. Likewise, a parent is liable for the
reasonable value of necessaries furnished to his or her infant. Based on this rule, choice (C)
is the best answer.

(D) This same issue was tested on the Multistate exam last year. Choice (B) is wrong
because the Statute of Frauds applies to oral agreements for the sale of goods of $500 or
more. In this hypo, we are not dealing with a contract for the sale of goods. Rather the par-
ties are entering into a service type contract. Likewise choice (C) is incorrect because
Dee's promise to pay an additional $1,000 (if she is successful on the bar exam) does not
vary or contradict the terms of the original agreement. Remember the purpose of the parol
evidence rule is to carry out the presumed intention of the parties and to exclude fraudu-
lent and perjured claims. In the present case, the parties clearly intended to honor the
payment of the additional $1,000 upon the condition of Dee's passing the bar exam. Note
that choice (A) is wrong because there is no rule in contract law that invalidates payment
of a "bonus". Also, promises to pay for services are generally enforceable. If past services
are rendered at request and with expectation of compensation, such past consideration is
sufficient to render enforceable a subsequent promise to pay a stated sum. By process of
elimination, choice (D) is thus correct.

(C) Ordinarily the death of the offeror terminates the power of acceptance created by
a revocable offer. But the situation is different when the death occurs  after the formation
of the contract. Death does not necessarily discharge a contract. If a contract, however,
calls for personal performance by the promisor and person who is to render the perfor-
mance dies or becomes ill as to make performance impossible, the promisor's duty is
excused unless the risk was assumed. Conversely, we have a situation where the promisee
not the promisor has died. Calamari states that the  doctrine of frustration of purpose usu-
ally applies in these cases. Moreover, where a contract has been discharged for impossi-
bility or frustration, it is often necessary, in the interest of justice, to adjust the rights of
the parties. In this situation, Calamari notes that recovery for part performance should be
available. Contracts, pg. 534. As a result, choice (C) is correct and Cheri will be entitled
to recover the reasonable value of services rendered despite the fact that the contract was
discharged by frustration.

31. (D) The parol evidence rule, a rule of substantive contract law, states that "when the par-
ties to a contract have put in writing the full and final expression of their agreement, evidence
of any other prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements are inadmissible to vary or
contradict the terms of the writing." In this fact pattern Kernel's prior oral agreement to repay
the loan on or before July 1 contradicts the April 5 written memorandum  which was "writ-
ten and supplied" by the plaintiff, Vault. Had Vault objected to the written terms he should
have done so on April 5, since the memorandum on that date may properly be viewed as a
complete, or integrated, writing of the parties' final expression of their agreement. The issue
of integration is a question of fact  to be decided by the judge. To determine integration under
the prevailing Willison test, if reasonable parties would have included the extrinsic matter

pble

CONTRACTS

(i.e., the substance of the oral agreement) in the writing, and these parties did not, then evi-
dence of the extrinsic matter may not be admitted, unless used to explain an ambiguity. In this
instance, the extrinsic evidence contradicted, rather than explained, the integrated writing.
Choice (D) is therefore correct.

32.

(D)	
The Statute of Frauds requires that a promise to answer for the debt of another must
be in writing, 1) identifying the parties and the subject matter, 2) stating the terms, conditions,
and consideration, and 3) signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought, or his
agent. For such a promise to fall within the Statute for Frauds it must be a  collateral, rather
than a primary, promise. Since Gritz was promising to personally guarantee Kernel
Corporation's debt, rather than his own, the promise was collateral. Choice (D) is therefore
correct. Students should note, however, that where the main purpose of the promisor is to
serve his or her own financial interest, the surety contract is  not within the Statute of Frauds.
Don't be fooled by the fact that Gritz is Kernel's president: Vault sued Kernel as the principal
debtor and Gritz as an individual guarantor.

Examination Tip:

The types of contracts covered within the Statute of Frauds may be remembered by the mnemonic
MY LEGS:

Marriage (a contract in consideration of)
Year (a contract not to be performable within one year)

Land (a contract for the purchase or transfer of an interest in)
Executor (a contract by an executor or administrator)
Guaranty (a contract of guaranty or suretyship)
Sale of goods (a contract for the sale of goods of $500 or more)

33.

34.	

(C)	
The Statute of Frauds prohibits an oral promise to answer for the debt of another.  In
other words, "secondary," or collateral, promises are within the rule and are voidable unless
in writing. On the other hand, according to  Restatement of Contracts 2d, § 116,  "A contract
that all or part of a duty of a third person to the promisee shall be satisfied is not within the
Statute of Frauds as a promise to answer for the duty of another if the consideration for the
promise is in fact or apparently desired by the promisor mainly for his own economic advan-
tage, rather than in order to benefit the third person." Under this so-called "main-purpose"
rule, if Larry (i.e., promisor) sought to act as surety for Electro's primary loan for his
own economic advantage (as 25% shareholder), then his oral promise to guarantee the loan
is enforceable, and choice (C) is thus correct. Choice (B) is not as good an answer because it
is less specific by not considering whether Larry's promise was primary — oral promise
enforceable — or collateral.

(B)	
The parol evidence rule states that once the parties have reduced their agreement to a
writing, evidence of any prior oral or written, or contemporaneous oral 
agreements is inad-
missible to alter, vary, or contradict the terms of the writing. The parol evidence rule has never
prevented proof of an oral or written agreement which varies or contradicts the terms of a
prior written  contract. Simpson, Contracts, p. 196. Since the oral agreement, which Dr.
Dreck claims took place during  the operation, occurred at a point in time  after  the written
contract to perform the surgery had been signed, Dr. Dreck will contend that the parol evi-
dence rule is not applicable as applied to a  subsequent  oral agreement. Choice (B) correctly
states this consideration. Choice (A) is incorrect because the conferral of a clear benefit would
be relevant to recovery in quasi-contract for the value of services rendered; however, quasi-
contract recovery is unavailable where the parties already have a valid existing contract.
Choice (C) is incorrect because the statute of frauds is not a relevant consideration. Even
though the statute of frauds may not apply to personal service contracts, the parol evidence

rule must be considered whenever an existing written contract is affected by a prior or
contemporaneous oral agreement. Choice (D) is incorrect because it states an irrelevant
consideration. Regardless of the nature of the second procedure, the  payment for it will be
determined by the court's interpretation of the subject matter of the original written contract.

(B) This Multistate question presents an interesting interplay between Contracts and
Evidence. Frequently, parol evidence questions will involve the admissibility of an oral
condition. Where the parties agree that a condition precedent must occur before the con-
tract is effective, it is generally agreed that the failure of the condition to occur may be
shown despite what otherwise would be deemed a total integration.  Thus, even if there is
a merger clause, it may be shown that the instrument was handed over to another with an
oral condition attached to delivery. The theory is that the agreement is not to take effect
until the condition occurs and thus there is no contract to be added to or contradicted until
that time. In this Multistate hypo, Toshi will be permitted to introduce evidence of Kifune's
refusal to approve the fish since the agreement was subject to this condition precedent.

(D) It is important to note that an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current
shipment normally invites acceptance  either by a prompt promise to ship or by prompt or
current shipment. As a result, choice (A) is wrong because Celanese could accept Purcher's
order by promising to ship the goods. Choice  (B) is incorrect because in accordance with
UCC Section 2-205, the "firm offer" rule provides: "An offer by a merchant to buy or sell
goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not
revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a rea-
sonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months." So,
therefore, no consideration was necessary to make Purcher's offer irrevocable. As between
answer choices (C) and (D), this is really a close call. However, choice (D) is preferred for
two reasons. First, it states that "Purcher's order was  irrevocable." Thus, choice (D) specifi-
cally refers to the irrevocability aspect as stated in UCC 2-205. Secondly, and perhaps more
importantly, choice (D) indicates that a "contract" was in fact formed. Since this is a breach
of contract action, Celanese will prevail because there was an enforceable agreement in effect.
Choice (C) simply states that Purcher's revocation was ineffective, but does not reach the
obvious conclusion that a contract existed. Once again, students must be familiar with the
"fine line" distinctions tested on the MBE. The best way to sharpen your Multistate skills is
simply by practice. It is a well known fact that performance improves with experience!

(C) In most "requirements" contracts, quantity is measured by the buyer's needs.
Celanese and Purcher have entered into a "requirements contract" whereby Celanese has
promised to supply Purcher with hydraulic fluid in monthly installments for one year.
Although the quantity term has been left out, the contract is still valid under UCC 2-204(3).
Where a buyer's needs significantly decrease over a relatively short period of time, the court
will view the good faith of the buyer. Under UCC 2-306(1)  "good faith" reductions (and
even abandonment) are allowed, such as where the buyer's business needs have actually
fallen off, provided the reductions are not "unreasonably disproportionate to...any normal or
otherwise comparable prior...requirements." White and Summers,  Uniform Commercial
Code, p. 126-127. In light of this rule, answer choice (C) is correct in best stating the rights
and duties of the parties. Choice (A) is incorrect because the "requirements" contract, as dis-
cussed above, was not unenforceable for indefiniteness. Choice  (B) is incorrect because a
buyer must exercise "good faith," not merely close down operations and place a heavy burden
on the seller.

38.

(C) Here, we have a set of Contracts examples dealing with the enforceability of a
"requirements" contract. Such contracts are valid because the quantity to be delivered can be
objectively determined. So a contract by a buyer to buy all the goods of a stated kind required
by the buyer in his business for the period is held not invalid for uncertainty as to quantity. In
the leading case of Minnesota Lumber Co. v. Whitebreast Coal Co.,  43 N.E. 774 (1896), a

buyer's promise to buy all the coal needed to run his factory for the year would be valid and
enforceable; and failure of the contract to specify the quantity would still render the contract
sufficiently definite since the buyer's requirements could be reasonably ascertained. Note that
choice (D) is wrong because the parties entered into a single  bilateral contract in which
mutual promises are given as the agreed exchange.  Likewise, choice (B) is incorrect because
Nu Skin did not promise to keep the offer open for a stated period of time. Rather, Nu Skin
proposed an offer to supply La Costa's requirements for the facial cleanser during the balance
of the year.

(A) According to UCC Section 2-708 (2), "If the measure of damages provided in sub-
section (1) is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have
done then the measure of damages is the profit which the seller would have made from full
performance by the buyer." Under subsection (1) the measure of damages is the difference
between the market price and the contract price. In the present situation, La Costa would be
entitled to net profits because the facts indicate that Geraldine Ferraro's substituted brand is
"less favored and less consumed." As such, La Costa will suffer lost volume sales on account
of Nu Skin's breach. Statement II is incorrect because La Costa's recovery is not limited to
nominal damages. Furthermore, statement III is not accurate because it doesn't reflect the
market price-contract price differential. Note: even though UCC Section 2-708 is a seller's
remedy provision, nonetheless it would probably be applicable because La Costa will be
engaged in the sale of the product.

(D) "Impossibility of performance excuses the promisor's duty where that which was
promised has become objectively impossible of fulfillment without fault of the promisor
after the time of contracting, provided the promisor has not assumed the risk of its now-
happening." Simpson, Contracts, pg. 359. On the other hand, Simpson states that  "the mere
personal inability of a promisor to perform is no excuse.  It is only where because of the
supervening event the performance cannot be rendered by anyone that the duty is discharged."
Ibid., p. 360. Thus, if Ace could have physically performed the renovation work according to
the agreed specifications, his duty will not be discharged by subjective impossibility due to
the finding of asbestos insulation. Ace will be liable for non-performance to Calvin. Choice
(D) is therefore Calvin's most persuasive argument. Lack of representations concerning the
asbestos by Calvin to Ace would only show lack of fraud by the plaintiff, but would not in
itself provide recovery for breach of contract. Accordingly, choice (A) is incorrect. The effect
of a mutual mistake is that there is no contract since there is no "meeting of the minds."
Choice (B) would therefore be incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because third-party donee
beneficiary reliance does not provide the promisee (Calvin) with his strongest argument in a
breach of contract action against the promisor (Ace). In fact, in a donee beneficiary contract,
the only remedy of the promisee is an action for  specific performance ordering the promisor
to pay (or perform for) the beneficiary.

41. (D) This question deals with the vesting of a donee beneficiary's rights.  If the promisee
intends the promised performance as a gift to the third party, the latter is a donee beneficiary.
Such intention is clear where performance of the promise will result solely in benefit to the
third party and not to the promisee. Simpson,  Contracts, p. 241. Since Ace's performance of
Calvin's promise was intended as a gift to benefit Patsy alone, and not Calvin, a donee bene-
ficiary situation arises. Under the majority common law view, the rights of a donee benefi-
ciary, as well as those of a creditor beneficiary, vest  when the third party with knowledge
assents to the promise. Before the time such rights are vested, a beneficiary cannot prevent
modification or rescission of the contract by the promisee and the promisor. Patsy's rights had
vested, however, before Calvin and Ace agreed to alter the renovation work. By allowing the
lease option for another office to expire, Patsy changed her position in reliance on her father's
gift and her assent is therefore presumed. Choice  (D) is correct. Since Patsy was an intended
beneficiary choice (A) is incorrect. An incidental beneficiary acquires no rights to enforce a

CONTRACTS	

10

contract. Choice (B) is also incorrect. Even though the promisor can assert against the bene-
ficiary any defense he could assert against the promisee, Ace has no valid defenses against
Calvin to be used against Patsy, since the facts of the question contain the assumption that
Ace will not be excused from performance. Choice (C) is incorrect because even though
modification at common law requires consideration, a donee beneficiary can only acquire
rights to enforce an agreement against the promisor upon learning of or otherwise assenting
to performance.

(D) Most students incorrectly assume that since Claret is mentioned in the Bouquet-
Vintage contract, he is a third-party beneficiary and choice (A) is correct. Generally, for a ben-
eficiary to be "intended," the third party must 1) receive performance directly from the
promisor, 2) be expressly designated in the contract, 3) have decisional rights regarding the
performance (such as time and location of performance), or 4) stand in such a relationship
with the promisee that it can be inferred that the promisee wished to benefit the third party. In
this question, however, there is an overriding consideration which must be derived from the
facts, namely the intent of the parties. The contract was viewed by Bouquet and Vintage as a
"venture" in which the two parties would "share equally" the profits and losses. Bouquet's
interests would be served by having 500,000 bottles each year carry his name on the label.
Vintage's interests would be served by gaining the one million dollars of working capital.
Neither party had ever dealt with Claret, and Claret was to be used as the distributor only if
"feasible." Therefore, despite language which might at first glance appear to give Claret
enforceable rights as a third-party beneficiary, a deeper analysis of the contractual intent of
the parties shows no apparent motive to benefit Claret. Thus, choice  (D) is the best answer.

(A) Since the growing of grapes in a vineyard is the type of performance which can be
considered unique (such as the services of a doctor, lawyer, or other professional whose own
individual skill is bargained for), Bouquet can successfully argue that the sale of Vintage's
vineyard to Agribiz created a risk of diminished profits, especially since the facts state that
Agribiz had no reputation or experience in wine-grape production. Therefore, by delegating
performance to Agribiz, Vintage was attempting  to delegate a duty involving personal judg-
ment and skill.  Such duties are not properly delegable. Choice (A) is thus correct. Students
should be aware that unlike with assignments, contractual restrictions against delegation of
duties are viewed strictly by the courts.

(D)	 With respect to the manner and effect of rightful rejection, UCC Section 2-602 pro-
vides: "Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender. It
is ineffective unless the buyer seasonably notifies the seller." In the present case, Redwood
accepted delivery and kept the redwood poles at its warehouse for  three months. Since
Redwood failed to reject the goods within a reasonable time, choice (D) most accurately states
the correct answer.

First of all, divisible contract answer choices frequently appear as a "red herring"
(B)	
or "distractor" on the MBE. Here is no exception. Choice (C) is wrong because  a divisible
contract is one in which the parties have divided their respective performances into sep-
arate units. So that performance of a given installment on one side is a constructive con-
dition to the duty of performance on the other. This question does not deal with dividing
performance into separate units. Rather, Guggenheim has agreed to buy five antique vases
from Sparticus in one delivery. In addition, choice (D) is wrong because  the substantial
performance doctrine only applies to construction contracts.  Similarly, choice (A) is
incorrect because a provision F.O.B. at seller's place of business indicates that the seller
must place the goods in the possession of the carrier, and, thereafter, the risk of loss passes
to the buyer. By process of elimination, choice (B) is correct.

46. (A)	 Whenever the seller makes a non-conforming tender, the buyer has three options:
(I) he may accept the whole shipment; or (2) reject the whole shipment; or (3) accept
any commercial unit or units and reject the rest. When the buyer accepts a commercial
unit (as in this question), he is only liable for the unit(s) accepted. According to UCC
Section 2-607, the buyer must pay at the contract rate for the goods accepted.  Choice (A)
is thus correct.

(B)	
In the area of seller's remedies, the traditional measure of damages is the differ-
ence between the contact price and the market price at the time and place for tender, less
expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach. This measure of recovery, however,
does not consider the so-called "lost volume" seller. Lost volume occurs when the seller
resells to a buyer who would have bought from the seller even if there had been no
breach of the original contract. The result is the seller's total volume of sales by year's
end is reduced by one, and his damages are the profit the seller would have made on that
additional sale. Since Circuit City stood to lose a $200 profit from the original sale, the
correct answer is choice (B).

(C)	
In this example, apparently  "time was of the essence."  In which case, the seller would
not be able to "cure" the non-conforming tender because the contract date of performance had
expired. According to UCC Section 2-508, "Where any tender or delivery by the seller is
rejected because non-conforming  and the time for performance has not yet expired,  the seller
may seasonably notify the buyer of his intention to cure and may then within the contract time
make a conforming delivery." Here, since the contract time had expired, Baker may properly
reject Zeller's non-conforming tender.

(B)	
According to UCC Section 2-714, "Where the buyer has accepted goods and given
notification (of breach), he may recover as damages for any non-conformity of tender the loss
resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller's breach as determined in any man-
ner which is reasonable." Note that "non-conformity" referred to in this section includes not
only breaches of warranties but also any failure of the seller to perform according to his
obligations under the contract. In the present case, Concita breached his contractual obliga-
tion by delivering 199 bushels of bananas instead of 200 bushels. As a result, Gelson may
recover damages for the non-conforming tender even though he accepted Concita's shipment.

(A)	
This question deals with a non-conforming tender in an installment contract. UCC
Section 2-612(2) provides that "the buyer may reject any installment which is non-conforming
if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured."
However, an installment delivery must be accepted if the non-conformity is curable  and the
seller gives adequate assurance of cure. Choice (A) is therefore correct because Gelson would
not be entitled to reject the shipment if Concita gave adequate assurances of cure.

be presently bound (3) to a
definite commitment (4) upon
E's acceptance.

CONTRACTS OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE
MIG 5
Multistate Issue Graph

REASONABLE APPEARANCE — objective test, applies even to offers made in jest or anger

PRESENTLY BOUND

NOT EXPRESSION OF FUTURE INTENT OR INTEREST (e.g.,
request for quotation).

ADVERTISEMENTS — generally deemed to be "invitations to an
offer" unless quantity is specific and language of promise is present.

AMBIGUITIES — construed against O.

DEFINITENESS

Parties — only E can accept (rewards are
generally offers for unilateral Kt).
Subject Matter
Quantity
Price — if unstated, UCC implies reasonable
price at time of delivery, payment due at time
and place buyer receives goods.
Time for Performance — if unstated, UCC
implies reasonable time at seller's place.
OFFEREE'S ACCEPTANCE — formation of the Kt in the hands of E; no further act by 0 required.

ESSENTIAL TERMS

MEDIUM — unless 0 unambiguously indicates otherwise, offer may accepted by any medium.

PERFORMANCE	

MANNER OF
ACCEPTANCE

BILATERAL CONTRACT — where offer may be accepted by a promise, E may also
accept by performing, but must inform 0 that he is doing so.

UNILATERAL CONTRACT —  if offer specifically calls for performance (not a mere
promise), no notice to 0 required if E performs (modern view forms Kt upon commence-
ment, but some courts say 0 may revoke any time prior to completion.)

PROMISE TO PERFORM — an offer may be accepted by dispatch of a promise to perform unless offer specifically
calls for performance.

SILENCE — valid acceptance if: 	

E INTENDS TO ACCEPT BY SILENCE AND 0 PRESCRIBES
SILENCE, or
PREVIOUS DEALINGS IMPLY ACCEPTANCE, or
 TAKING BENEFIT OR EXERCISING CONTROL —  if E has opportunity
to reject offer but instead takes benefits or exercises dominion over
goods offered.

UNEQUIVOCAL ACCEPTANCE — unequivocal acceptance (even if "grumbling") forms Kt upon dispatch.
COMMON LAW — proposal of new terms (not mere inquiries
for a better offer) makes acceptance invalid and acts as
counteroffer (i.e., a rejection).

EQUIVOCAL ACCEPTANCE:
PROPOSING NEW TERMS

UCC — a "definite and seasonable" acceptance which proposes
new but not inconsistent terms forms a Kt on O's terms if E's
acceptance is in writing; 0 may accept or reject new terms.

UCC MERCHANT'S RULE —  between merchants, if E
proposes new but not inconsistent terms along with a "definite
and seasonable" acceptance, Kt includes new terms unless:
(1) 0 explicitly objects to new terms, or (2) new terms materially
alter original offer, or (3) offer expressly limited to O's terms

OFFEREE'S RESPONSE

REJECTION — terminates offer when received by O.
COUNTEROFFER — operates as a rejection when received by 0 and terminates original offer.
INDECISION — offer remains open until terminated by 0 or lapse of time.

TERMINATION OF OFFER

REVOCATION — offer terminates
when E receives notice of O's
revocation in spite of express
promise not to revoke unless:

Paid-for Option — promise to keep offer open supported
by consideration.

UCC Firm Offer — promise to keep offer open is
enforceable without consideration if:  (1) made by
merchant, (2) signed writing for the (3) sale of goods and
(4) E accepts within three months.

REJECTION — an express rejection or counteroffer terminates an offer  upon receipt.
INDIRECT REVOCATION —  unaccepted offer terminates when E  learns of acts by 0 inconsistent with
offer.
LAPSE OF TIME — unaccepted offer expires upon lapse of time stated in offer or by a "reasonable
time."
DEATH OR INSANITY — unaccepted offer terminates when E learns of O's death or insanity.
DESTRUCTION OF SUBJECT MATTER —  offer terminates when subject matter of offer is destroyed.

INTERVENING ILLEGALITY — offer legal when made terminates if made illegal before acceptance.

CONTRACT REMEDIES

Restitution — recovery of money already paid to breaching party (less possible  quantum meruit offset).
Reliance Costs — recovery of out-of-pocket expenses in preparing to perform.
Incidental Costs — recovery of costs necessitated by breach directly relating to the contract itself (e.g., shipping, storage, inspection,
reselling or repurchasing).

MONEY DAMAGES — normal remedy; should
place non-breaching party in position he would
have been in had the contract been performed.

Expected Bargained For Benefit  —
not including anticipated profits (see
consequential costs).

Consequential Costs and Losses —
money damages resulting from special
situation of non-breaching party  (not
including mental anguish or
inconvenience).

Liquidated Damages — contractual
provision setting the total amount of all
money damages in the event of breach
(does not bar non-monetary remedies);
if invalid, non-breacher may prove and
collect actual damages.

SALES CONTRACTS —
the contract price.

SERVICE CONTRACT

Employee — full contract price if she has performed
or stands ready to do so (less mitigation).
Employer — recovery limited to costs of replacement.

FORESEEABLE — Hadley v Baxendale — reasonably foreseeable costs and losses
contemplated by both parties at the time of the contract may be recovered.
MITIGATION — non-breacher's recovery must be reduced by amount yielded or yieldable
by reasonable efforts to reduce costs of breach.

REASONABLE AMOUNT — amount must be reasonable in light of parties'
contemplations at the time of contract.
NECESSARY — amount of actual damages must be difficult to ascertain.
TAILORED TO CONTRACT —  provision must be tailored to nature of contract (i.e., not
boilerplate).

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE — court may order
breaching party to perform the contract.  

RESCISSION — cancellation of the contract to
put parties as they were before the contract. 

Punitive Damages — only available in extreme cases of malicious or intentional breach (like a separate tort recovery).

Contract Must be Valid and Enforceable

Money Damages Must Be Inadequate

UNIQUE SUBJECT MATTER —  land, stock of close corporation, one-of-a-kind item.
AMOUNT NOT ASCERTAINABLE

No Special Problems of Enforcement —  (e.g., personal service contract may not be specifically enforced).
Subject to Equitable Defenses — look for (1) unclean hands, (2) laches, (3) estoppel.

Grounds 

MUTUAL MISTAKE IN FORMATION
FRAUD — knowing misrepresentation of material fact relied upon by non-breacher.
MAJOR BREACH CHANGING NATURE OF AGREEMENT

Requirements

NON-BREACHING PARTY MUST HAVE CLEAN HANDS
NOTIFICATION WITHIN REASONABLE TIME
RESTORATION OF BREACHER TO STATUS QUO — non-breacher must return all consideration unless
alteration or change made in good faith reliance that breacher would perform.

REFORMATION — court may reform contract to accurately describe the actual agreement if there was a mutual mistake.
QUASI-CONTRACT — if no formal contract and work has been partly or fully performed, plaintiff may collect reasonable value of services  from the actor's point of view; if an express contract was breached,
P may sue on the contract or, if there are grounds for rescission, rescind it and sue for the reasonable value of services performed or goods transferred using the quasi-contract theory. This is actually an
alternative theory for money damages based on equity rather than contract.

CRIMINAL
LAW

Criminal law. The substantive criminal law
which for the purpose of preventing harm to
declares what conduct is criminal, and (b)
punishment to be imposed for such conduct. It
definition of specific offenses and general p:
liability.	
Substantative criminal laws are
codified into criminal or penal codes; e.g. U.S
18, California Penal Code, Model Penal Code

1 (A) As already noted in this question, bad thoughts alone cannot constitute a crime; there
must be an act, or an omission to act where there is a legal duty to act. Thus, the common
law crimes are defined in terms of act or omission to act, and statutory crimes are unconsti-
tutional unless so defined. In the present example, choice (B) is wrong because the facts are
not clear whether Bernie acted voluntarily. Although a physician testified that Bernie's brain
tumor could at times deprive him of his ability to control his movements, there is no show-
ing that he acted involuntarily. Choice (C) is incorrect because one may be guilty of crimi-
nal homicide even though she is unconscious or asleep at the time of the fatal impact (as
where A, being subject to frequent fainting spells, has such a spell while driving her car).
Here, Cassandra's voluntary act consists of driving the car, and if the necessary mental state
can be established as of that time (e.g., finding recklessness on the basis of her knowledge
that she was an epileptic), it is enough to make her guilty of a manslaughter. By the same
token, choice (D) is not the best answer because voluntary intoxication (either by alcohol or
drugs) will never reduce a murder to a manslaughter. At most, intoxication (if it robs the
defendant of his ability to premeditate and deliberate) will reduce his crime from first degree
to second degree murder. However, it will never result in an acquittal, so therefore choice (D)
is wrong. Choice (A) is correct because according to LaFave "one is not guilty of murder if
he killed the victim while asleep or in the clouded state between sleeping and walking." Even
assuming that "the conduct of a sleepwalker may be purposive (though not recollected on
waking), and may be regarded as expressing unconscious desire," it is nonetheless undoubt-
edly sound not to impose liability for an unconscious desire which is manifested in this way.
See, Criminal Law, pg. 180.

2.

3.

(B) As noted previously, Criminal Law questions on the MBE are becoming increasingly
more "tricky." Here, for example, is a problem dealing with the  mens rea requirement of
knowledge.  The New Mexico statute provides that a person must "knowingly possess, sell or
transport narcotics." The facts further state that Pat did not actually know that the contents of
the package contained narcotics. Thus, many students will be "suckered" into choosing choice
(C). However, LaFave states that in cases of "wilful blindness" where the defendant is delib-
erately ignorant of certain facts, then he or she can be held criminally liable. Illustrative is  U.S.
v. Jewell, 532 F. 2d 697(1976), where the evidence was that the defendant was paid $100 to
drive a truck with a secret compartment into the United States from Mexico and that he delib-
erately refrained from looking into the compartment and ascertaining there were drugs inside.
The Supreme Court concluded that the defendant's "wilful blindness" was sufficiently culpa-
ble to "where it can almost be said that he actually knew" that drugs were present.

(D) By process of elimination, choice (D) is the correct answer. The crime of bigamy
is defined as marrying of another when one has a husband or wife living. It is a statutory
crime. Like statutory rape, bigamy is a strict liability crime, whereby culpability is
imposed merely for doing the act which is prohibited by statute. No mens rea is required.
Therefore, mistake is no defense. In the area of mistake, students should be aware that mis-
take of fact may be a defense where it negates the existence of a mental state required to
establish a material element of the crime. In general, mistake of fact may negate a  "gen-
eral intent" crime only where it is reasonable, or a "specific intent" crime, whether it is
reasonable or unreasonable. On the other hand,  mistake of law  (i.e., where the defendant
is unaware that his acts are criminally proscribed) is generally no defense. In choices (A)
and (C), defendant's mistake negates a material element of a "specific intent" crime and
is therefore a valid defense. In choice (B), defendant's mistake would probably be valid
grounds to mitigate the charge of murder to voluntary manslaughter.

Multistate Criminal Law Variations:

Barrow, Stern and Larkin were roommates at
Fremont College in Boston. During their Thanks-
giving vacation, Barrow and Stern drove to New York
City to visit relatives. While in New York, Stern was
injured in an automobile accident. As a consequence,
she couldn't return to Boston with Barrow. The day
that Barrow was to drive back to college Stern asked
her if she would deliver a package to Larkin. Barrow
agreed and Stern gave her a small package which
Barrow placed in her glove compartment.

While driving through Connecticut, Barrow was
stopped for speeding. When the state trooper asked
Barrow for her license and registration, she reached
into the glove compartment. As she did, the package
which Stern had given her fell onto the floor. When it
hit the floor, the box broke open and a plastic envelope
containing a white substance slid out. Seeing that the
substance appeared to be cocaine, the state trooper
arrested Barrow for possession of illegal narcotics
under a state statute making it a felony to "wilfully
possess" a controlled dangerous substance. The pack-
age did, in fact, contain cocaine.

1. If Barrow is later brought to trial for this charge,

her best defense is that
(A) Barrow didn't know what was in the package
(B) Stern didn't tell her she was carrying illegal

narcotics
the package didn't belong to her
the cocaine was illegally seized

(C)
(D)

Answer: (A)

Drip purchased a used 1978 Oldsmobile convertible
from Geek for $750. Their sales agreement provided
that Geek was selling the car in an "as is" condition.
Two days later Drip was cleaning the auto when he
noticed a sealed envelope in the glove compartment.
He opened the envelope and discovered it contained a
small amount of hashish, a narcotic that is smoked,
chewed or drunk for its intoxicating effect. Drip
immediately telephoned Geek and told her what he
had found. Geek indicated that the hash was in fact
hers and asked Drip if he would hold on to it for a cou-
ple of days until she could pick it up. Drip reluctantly
agreed. Drip then wrote Geek's name on the envelope
and placed it back in the glove compartment. The next
day Drip was driving the car when he was stopped by
the police for speeding. He was then asked to produce
the registration for the vehicle. As he opened the glove
compartment, the hashish fell out of the envelope. It
was seen by the officer who promptly arrested Drip
and charged him with violating a statute which pro-
hibited the "willful and unlawful possession of a con-
trolled dangerous substance."

2. At Drip's trial, Geek testified that the hashish was
really hers and not Drip's. She further noted that
she forgot to remove the hashish from the glove
compartment when she sold the car to Drip. If the
jury believes Geek, Drip should be found
(A) not guilty, because he did not willfully acquire
the hashish and hence committed no crime
(B) not guilty, because he was not the true owner

of the hashish

(C) guilty, because he knowingly possessed the

hashish

(D) guilty, because he acquired the hashish when
he intentionally purchased the car from Geek
in an "as is" condition

Larceny at common law may be defined as the (1) trespassory (2) taking and (3) car-
rying away of the (4) personal property (5) of another (6) with intent to steal it. Students must
be advised that the crime of larceny requires an intent to steal, that is, an intent to deprive the
owner of the possession of his (or her) property permanently or for an unreasonable length of
time. Here, Pickney did not possess an intent to steal (i.e., no  animus furandi). As a result,
answer choice (C) is correct.

(B) In picking the "best" answer on any given Multistate problem, always try to identify the
issue being tested. Here, for example, is a Criminal Law question dealing with self-defense. As a
general rule, one who is not the aggressor is justified in using a reasonable amount of force against
his adversary when he reasonably believes (a) that he is in immediate danger of unlawful bod-
ily harm from his adversary and (b) that the use of such force is necessary to avoid this danger.
Likewise, deadly force is justified when an individual is threatened with serious bodily injury or
death. Note that (A) is not the best answer because it does not specifically address Sammy's belief
that his life was in danger. Although Vernon had his gun drawn, that fact standing alone does not
necessarily put Sammy's life in danger. On the contrary, choice (B) is a better answer because it
does state that Sammy believed his life to be in danger, which is a necessary element of
self-defense.

(B) Arson is defined as the malicious burning of the dwelling house of another.  By def-
inition arson is a "general intent" crime because it does not require a specific mental state of
intent. As a general rule, voluntary intoxication is no defense for a "general intent" crime.
Therefore, choice (B) is correct.

(B) The traditional M'Naghten test  provides that a defendant is entitled to acquittal  "if
at the time of committing the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of
reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act that
he was doing, or if he did know it, he did not know what he was doing was wrong."  Note
that statement I will not provide a valid defense under M'Naghten. If the defendant suffers
from delusions (or false beliefs), it is necessary to determine whether (if the facts had been
as he believed them to be), his actions would have been criminal. Here, Defendant was not
legally justified to fire a gun at the "shadow". Since his actions were, in fact, criminal, he
cannot avail himself of the M'Naghten defense. Also, statement III will not provide a valid
defense because under the M'Naghten rule, it is irrelevant that the defendant is unable to
control his actions. Loss of control because of mental illness is no defense. On the con-
trary, statement II would provide a valid insanity defense because when a person is oper-
ating under an insane delusion, LaFave points out that "he must be considered in the same
situation as to responsibility as if the facts with respect to which the delusion exists were
real." Thus, for example, if under the influence of his delusion, the defendant believes that
another person is attempting to take away his life, and he kills that man supposedly in self-
defense, he would be exempt from punishment. Criminal Law, pg. 316.

(A) Choice (A) is not accurate and therefore the correct answer choice. The defense of
entrapment is not a constitutional defense, and states are at liability to limit its application.
United States v. Russell,  411 U.S. 423, 432 (1973) (referring to the "nonconstitutional
defense of entrapment"). Choice (B) is an accurate statement and therefore incorrect. In
Matthew v. United States,  485 U.S. 58 (1988), the Supreme Court ruled that, in federal
prosecutions, even if the defendant denies one or more elements of the crime, he is enti-
tled to an entrapment instruction whenever there is sufficient evidence a jury could find
entrapment. Choice (C) is also an accurate statement and therefore incorrect. Entrapment
by estoppel is a valid defense in most jurisdictions, even though it is a narrow exception
to the rule that ignorance of the law is no defense. The entrapment by estoppel defense
applies where a government official assures a defendant that certain conduct is legal, and
the defendant reasonably relies on that advice and engages in that conduct. To establish
this defense, a defendant must show (1) a government official told him the act was legal,
(2) defendant relied on this advice, (3) the reliance was reasonable and (4) that a prosecu-
tion would be unfair. See, 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law § 78 (Entrapment by Estoppel) (2007).
One of the leading cases is United States v. Batterie,  361 F. 3d 1210 (9th Cir. 2004), where
the court ruled that an alien, who truthfully disclosed all information on a form promul-
gated by the ATF, had been wrongfully advised by a federally licensed firearms dealer that
he could buy a gun based on his status as a non-immigrant alien and would not be prose-
cuted for illegal possession of a firearm, was entitled to an entrapment by estoppel defense.
Choice (D) is an accurate statement and therefore incorrect. In  United States v. Russell,
411 U.S. 423 (1973), the Supreme Court rejected an entrapment defense where the gov-
ernment supplied an essential chemical to be used in an illegal manufacturing enterprise.
Subsequently, the Supreme Court ruled that where the Government has induced a defen-
dant to break the law and the defense raises the issue of entrapment, the prosecution must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had a predisposition to commit the
offense prior to first being approached by a government agent.  Jacobson v. United States,
503 U.S. 540 (1991). Note that a slight majority of states requires the defendant to prove
entrapment by a preponderance of evidence. 52 A.L.R. 4th 775.

9. (A) LaFave points out that intentional death may be "effectively brought about by an
omission to act." One is not guilty of murder for intentionally killing by failure to act, how-
ever, unless the circumstances are such that there is a duty to act. A typical example of the
duty to act is the duty of a parent to rescue her imperiled infant, like one who is drowning
face-down in the bathtub, lacking the ability to extricate itself from its difficulty. Failure

to rescue would be murder if parent intends to kill the child, either by desiring the death
or, without wishing for death, knowing that death is substantially sure to result from fail-
ure to rescue. Criminal Law, pg. 539. Similarly, the common law imposes an affirmative
duty upon a husband to aid his wife (and vice versa). In the case of  Territory v. Manton,
19 P. 387 (1888), a husband who left his intoxicated wife out in the snow was found guilty
of murder for her death.

(D) Choice (A) is an example of intent-to-inflict serious bodily injury murder. Choice (B)
is an example of "depraved-heart" murder. Choice (C) is an example of felony murder.
Conversely, choice (D) is characteristic of involuntary manslaughter or misdemeanor-
manslaughter. Note that Defendant committed a battery (which at common law was a misde-
meanor) by pushing victim into the pool.

(B) Choice (B) is the correct answer. Malice aforethought does not require an intent to
kill. "Malice" at common law may consist of any of four states of mind: (1) felony-murder,
(2) intent to kill type malice, (3) extreme reckless conduct likely to cause death or serious
injury, or (4) intent to cause serious bodily injury which results in death. In this question,
Defendant intended to cause serious injury to Victim which resulted in his death. Defendant
may properly be convicted of second-degree murder (not first-degree). Choice (C) is wrong
even if Defendant was unaware of Victim's medical condition, because he intended to cause
serious injury. Choice (D) is wrong because in heat of passion killing, to qualify as
manslaughter, requires inter alia that the provocation be adequate, i.e., cause a reasonable per-
son to lose self-control under the circumstances. Defendant's loss of control here would not
seem to qualify as reasonable.

(C) This question presents the difficult concept of what standard the court should use for
a defendant in a criminal case to determine adequacy of provocation as a basis for mitigating
murder to manslaughter. Formerly, the fact that the defendant possessed some peculiar phys-
ical or mental characteristic was uniformly held not to be considered in determining provoca-
tion (i.e., head injury, sunstroke, sexual impotence). The test was how the victim's conduct
affected a reasonable man, not how it affected a man with the defendant's physical character-
istics. LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law, p. 578. Modernly, however, the strictly objective rea-
sonable man test for determining adequacy of provocation has been considerably broadened.
Under the Model Penal Code, at least some individual peculiarities should be taken into
account "because they bear upon the inference as to the actor's character that is fair to draw
upon as the basis of his act." Model Penal Code, Sec. 20.3 Comment. As a professional ten-
nis player, Jimbo's Achilles tendon injury was particularly significant, both emotionally and
financially, because it could threaten his entire career. Therefore, such a physical condition
should be considered by the court. Furthermore, the provocation required for voluntary
manslaughter must be that which will arouse a heat of passion in a reasonable  sober man. A
defendant's voluntary intoxication which unreasonably provokes him to lose his self-control
will not reduce homicide to manslaughter. LaFave and Scott,  Criminal Law, p. 347.
Therefore, Jimbo will be judged as a professional tennis player with an Achilles tendon injury
who is not intoxicated. Choice (C) is correct.

13.

(D) By process of elimination, choice (A) is wrong because double jeopardy bars re-
prosecution for the (same) offense after there has been a final judgment. Yancy and
Yolanda were originally prosecuted for the misdemeanor of furnishing liquor to a minor.
Subsequently, the defendants were charged with involuntary manslaughter. Since these two
offenses are not identical (inasmuch as each requires proof of an additional fact which the
other does not), double jeopardy will not apply. Choice (B) is wrong because  res judicata
relates to civil cases and bars re-litigation of a claim (e.g., negligence) after a final judg-
ment. Choice (C) is wrong because  collateral estoppel stands for "issue preclusion." Once

an issue (such as defendant's identity) has been litigated, the same issue cannot be litigat-
ed again by the same parties. Therefore, choice (D) is the best answer simply by process
of elimination.

(B) This is a truly "classic" Multistate question dealing with murder. There are four
types of murder: (1) intentional killing with premeditation or deliberation; (2) intent to
inflict serious bodily injury; (3) felony-murder; and (4) depraved-heart (or reckless killing)
murder. On the July, 2003 MBE a similar type of intent to inflict serious bodily injury
murder was tested. Note that Ramirez intended to inflict serious bodily injury when he
deliberately shot Belle in the arm. Choice (A) is wrong because in order to convict a per-
son of felony-murder, the underlying felony must be malum in se or an inherently dan-
gerous felony. Defrauding an insurance company is malum prohibitum and does not
involve a danger to life.

(C) Robbery is generally defined as the trespassory taking and carrying away of the per-
sonal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner, whereby (1) the
taking of the property is from the person of the victim or in his presence, and (2) the taking is
accomplished by means of violence or intimidation. La Fave,  Criminal Law, p. 692. If Justin
is prosecuted for felony-murder and acquitted, his acquittal will most likely be based on the
fact that no robbery occurred. Choice (C) is correct. Note that choice (C) is a better answer
than either (A) or (B) because if the underlying felony did not occur, then there is no crimi-
nal liability for felony-murder. Also, choice  (D) is not the best answer because robbery sim-
ply requires that the victim be placed in fear or intimidated. Even where the defendant uses
an unloaded gun or toy pistol, he may nevertheless be guilty of robbery if the victim was
placed in fear or apprehension. However, on a recent MBE, students were required to know
that aggravated robbery does require the robber to be armed with a "dangerous" or "deadly"
weapon.

(B) Here is another example of  depraved-heart murder, which is usually defined as
second degree murder. In accordance with the statutory definition, second degree murder
"covers all other unlawful killings with express or implied malice aforethought."  To be
sure, many students will be inclined to choose (C) under the wrongful assumption that
Skakel did not act with malice. Although he may not have acted with express malice, his
conduct involved implied malice. Originally, at early common law (around the year 1550)
murder was defined by statute as a premeditated intent to kill (which is the literal mean-
ing of "malice aforethought"). However, after 1550, new types of murder were classified
to include killings without premeditation, such as felony-murder and depraved-heart mur-
der. Today, modern courts and legislatures still frequently define murder in terms of  "mal-
ice aforethought, express or implied" which now cover all four types of murder: (1) intent
to kill murder; (2) felony-murder; (3) depraved-heart murder; and (4) intent-to-do-serious-
bodily-injury murder. LaFave, pg. 529. Choice (B) is correct because implied malice is
found in depraved-heart murder despite the fact that it is an unintentional killing.

(A) For the crime of solicitation to be completed, it is only necessary that the actor, with
intent that another person commit a crime, have enticed, advised, incited, ordered or otherwise
encouraged that person to commit a crime. The crime solicited need not be committed.
LaFave notes that it is not a defense to a solicitation charge that, unknown to the solicitor, the
person solicited could not commit the crime.  Criminal Law, pg. 422. Similarly, it is also no
defense that the person solicited is an undercover agent and under no circumstances would
have committed the crime solicited. See  State v. Davis, 319 Mo. 1222, 6 S.W. 2d 609 (1928).
It is important to point out that Wife is not guilty of conspiracy because an essential element
of the crime is an agreement (for an unlawful purpose) between two or more persons. For
example, assume that A wants to burglarize a store and thus approaches B to solicit his assis-

tance in the commission of the crime, that upon hearing A's plan B manifests his complete
concurrence in the scheme and expresses his willingness to participate, but that B secretly
intends not to go through with the plan and has merely feigned agreement because he wishes
to trap A. Under these circumstances there is no conspiracy because there is no agreement
since B obviously does not have the required intent-to-burglarize mental state. Although A has
the requisite mental state, he may not be convicted of conspiracy because there has been no
agreement and thus no criminal act. LaFave, pg. 459.

18. (C) Students should be aware that Speedster is charged with  attempted murder.  LaFave
and Scott in their Handbook on Criminal Law point out that the crime of attempt consists
of: (1) an intent to do an act or to bring about certain consequences which would in law
amount to a crime; and (2) an act in furtherance of that intent which, as it is most commonly
put, goes beyond mere preparation. As such, attempt is a specific intent crime. Since the
defendant in this example did not have the (specific) intent to kill Lisa, he would be found not
guilty of the inchoate crime of attempted  murder.

Multistate Variation:

Assume the Examiners change the facts in two subtle ways. First, Lisa is killed and Speedster
is charged with murder  rather than attempted murder. Under these circumstances, he could
be found guilty of "depraved-heart" murder because he was driving his auto at 100 miles per
hour in a residential area. Clearly, this would constitute extremely negligent conduct which
creates not only an unjustifiable but also a very high degree of risk of death.

(B) Criminal attempt requires two elements: (1) specific intent to commit the "target
offense" and (2) a substantial step" in the commission or attempted commission of the crime.
However, this question goes a step further by raising the possible defense of impossibility.
Legal impossibility is a defense to an attempt crime whereas factual impossibility is not.
Choices (C) and (D) are wrong because they are examples of factual impossibility. In each
situation, Defendant was unable to complete the target offense because of the particular facts
applicable to the situation. Legal impossibility is where the defendant intends to accomplish
an act which is not prescribed by law. Choice (B) is an example of legal impossibility. Even
if Wright had succeeded in burning down his own home, he would not be guilty of arson,
which requires the burning of the dwelling of another. Lastily, it should be noted that choice
(A) is incorrect because the defendant, even though he completed the target offense, can be
convicted of attempt so long as he is not charged with both attempt and the target crime at
the same time.

(D) The traditional definition of conspiracy requires the following two elements: (1) an
agreement between two or more persons (which constitutes the act) and (2) an intent to
achieve a criminal or unlawful objective. To constitute conspiracy at common law,  there
must be a combination of two or more guilty persons.  Based on these facts, the "plural-
ity" requirement is not satisfied because Kareem is an innocent party who believed that
he was the true owner of the John Coltrane album. In addition, Elgin never entered into
an agreement with Russell or Kareem but rather intended individually to commit a theft
inside Wilt's home.

(D) This is a tricky conspiracy question focusing on the necessity for an agreement.
There certainly was an agreement between Margo and Tyler. The question is whether
Vinnie was ever a party to that agreement. The comment to Model Penal Code section 5.03
states, "Guilt as a conspirator is measured by the situation as the actor views it; he must
have the purpose of promoting or facilitating a criminal offense, and with that purpose
must agree (or believe that he is agreeing) with another that they will engage in the crim-
inal offense or in solicitation to commit it." The comment goes on to say that one who aids
a conspiracy should be subjected to prosecution and punishment on some theory other than
he has become a member of the conspiracy. Therefore, since Vinnie aided and abetted but
never communicated his agreement to Margo and Tyler, he is not a member of the con-
spiracy. Choice (A) is wrong because the unilateral conspiracy theory followed by the
Model Penal Code applies where the defendant believes he has an agreement but does not.
That is not the situation here. Choice (B) is wrong because, since no conspiracy was ever
formed involving Vinnie, it does not matter whether Margo was acquitted. Choice (C) is
incorrect because there was an agreement between Margo and Tyler, however Vinnie
would not be considered a party to that agreement. Note: the unilateral approach applies
where a defendant believes he has entered into an agreement but actually has not, like in
the situation where a defendant agrees with a feigning accomplice.

22.

(C) This is an extremely difficult Criminal Law question dealing with the defense of with-
drawal. With regard to whether withdrawal is an affirmative defense to conspiracy, the
common law rule is strict and inflexible. Since the crime is complete with the agreement, no
subsequent action can exonerate the conspirator of that crime. Conversely, withdrawal may be
a defense to subsequent crimes committed by the other conspirators. However, in order for
withdrawal to be a defense for subsequent crimes,  notice must be given to all of the other
conspirators. Since Igor did not give notice to Divoc, his withdrawal was ineffective. As a
result, he will be guilty for conspiracy as well as robbery and (felony) murder. Therefore,
choice (C) is correct.

(D) Charlie is guilty of the theft of the car regardless of his participation in a conspiracy.
Charlie is also guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery even if Baker is a police informant who
lacks the mental state required for a conspiracy. The agreement between Able and Charlie is
sufficient for the unlawful agreement; and the theft of the car is a sufficient overt act in fur-
therance of the agreement. Able is guilty of attempted robbery as he took a substantial step
towards the commission of the robbery (by entering the bank). Therefore, Charlie is also
guilty of attempted robbery under the so-called  "Pinkerton Rule:" all co-conspirators are
liable for all crimes committed by any conspirator in furtherance of the original agreement
(majority view—except not followed in Arizona). See,  Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S.
640 (1946). Choice (B) is incorrect because the crime of conspiracy and the subsequent
crimes do not merge (unlike solicitation and attempt which  do merge).

(B) Common law conspiracy only requires proof of an unlawful agreement between two
or more persons—no overt act in furtherance of an agreement is required. Thus, Choice (D)
is incorrect. Under the Pinkerton Doctrine, all conspirators are liable for any crimes commit-
ted in furtherance of the original agreement. Nelson is guilty of attempted robbery, not rob-
bery. Because Jack did not receive possession of the money, only an attempted robbery
occurred here. Thus, Choice (C) is incorrect. Nelson may also be convicted of felony murder
under the Pinkerton Rule. The killing of an innocent person during an inherently dangerous
felony (robbery) is a foreseeable result, and all participants in the underlying felony may be
convicted of felony murder. Thus, choice (A) is incorrect, as Nelson may properly be con-
victed of felony murder.

(D) In order to be guilty as an accomplice, generally two requirements must be met: (1)
the individual must have the intent to promote or facilitate commission of the crime and
(2) he must "aid" and "abet" or give encouragement in the commission or attempted com-
mission of the crime. There is a split of authority as to whether some lesser mental state will
suffice for accomplice liability, such as mere knowledge that one is aiding a crime. The
majority view, however, is that an accomplice must intend that his acts have the effect of
assisting or encouraging another. Here, the facts state that Mitch "feigned agreement." If
Mitch only pretended to agree without actually intending to aid and abet the gang members,
then no accomplice liability will be imposed.

(C) The key words in this question are that Harry "was playing a practical joke on Mr.
Scylla and was trying to scare him." The mental state described by these words falls short of
that necessary under the given Ames Penal Code. The Ames statute requires for assault an
unlawful "attempt" – i.e., an intent plus an act to commit an unlawful application of force
(i.e., a battery). If Harry did not intend to commit any application of force on Mr. Scylla,
which is what the facts state, then, if the jury believes him, he will be not guilty due to lack
of intent to cause physical injury. Therefore, choice (C) is correct. Without a specific intent to
unlawfully apply force, Harry cannot be guilty, so choices (A) and (B) are incorrect. Choice
(D) is incorrect since fright is not required for criminal assault under the given statute.

27. (B) This is an extremely "tricky" Multistate question testing students on the distinction
between solicitation and conspiracy. For the crime of solicitation to be completed, it is only
necessary that the defendant (1) entice, advise, incite, order or otherwise encourage another
person to commit a crime (2) with the intent that the crime be committed. On the other hand,
conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more individuals to commit a criminal
offense. Here, it is important to point out that under the given facts no true agreement actual-
ly occurred. Rather Sissy solicited Lex to recklessly engage in conduct knowing that it would
create a high risk of causing injury to the patrons in the movie theatre. Thus, Sissy and Lex

would be guilty of battery, but not of conspiracy. Note, too, that choice (D) is wrong because
solicitation merges with the completed crime. Also, choice (A) is incorrect because arson at
common law requires the burning of the dwelling house of another, not a commercial struc-
ture. Furthermore, the fire must cause damage to the structure (e.g., charring) not just a mere
blackening.

(D) This fact pattern presents a very difficult Criminal Law question dealing with con-
spiracy. A conspiracy may be defined as "(1) an agreement between two or more persons,
which constitutes the act; and (2) an intent to thereby achieve a certain objective which under
the common law definition, is the doing of either an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful
means." LaFave, Criminal Law, p. 453. Regarding the limits of liability for conspiracy
LaFave states that, "Conspiracy is an offense which continues up to the point of abandonment
or success. Success is not limited to the accomplishment of the criminal objective but may
include subsequent concealment if part of the original agreement". Ibid., pp. 470-471. The
key to this question lies in a careful reading of the words Tucker agreed to: Tucker agreed to
stash the jewels at his house after the robbery  "until the heat's off" Tucker's agreement to
conceal the stolen property was part of the original criminal agreement (prior to Marshall's
commission of the burglary). Therefore, despite his earlier refusal to take part in the burglary,
Tucker is guilty as a conspirator (i.e., guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary and burglary)
as well as an accessory after the fact. Choice (B) is therefore incorrect. Choice (C) is incor-
rect since a conspirator will be liable for all crimes committed in  furtherance of the conspir-
acy, as well as the conspiracy itself. Choice (D) is therefore the correct answer.

(A) This is a very clever Multistate question dealing with the related crimes of larceny,
assault and robbery. Clearly, Gibby is guilty of larceny for the theft of Becky's pocketbook
and groceries. As noted previously, larceny at common law is defined as the (1) trespassory
(2) taking (3) carrying away (4) of the personal property (5) of another (6) with intent to steal.
It is important to note that Gibby is not guilty of assault, which is defined as an unlawful
attempt to commit a battery. Assault is a specific intent crime. The defendant must have the
intent to commit a battery. Did Gibby intend to commit a battery on Becky? The answer is no.
Therefore, choice (B) is wrong. Although Becky was "startled," the facts do not indicate that
Gibby possessed the requisite mens rea to be guilty of criminal assault. Note that choices (C)
and (D) are wrong because robbery requires that the taking be accomplished by means of
force, violence or intimidation. This was not a forceful or violent taking. Moreover, there was
no threat to do harm to the victim.

30. (B) Theft (larceny) consists of the physical movement (asportation) of the property of
another without consent (caption) with intent to steal (or permanently deprive). The crime
is complete once the defendant moves the property (any distance) with the intent to steal.
Change of heart or returning the property after the initial taking is no defense. Thus,
Customer is guilty of theft of the camera. However, Customer is not guilty of theft of the
suntan oil, as she lacked an intent to steal. She "inadvertantly" forgot to pay for the oil.
Her decision to return to the store and pay for the oil is further indication of her lack of
intent to steal. Thus, choices (A), (C) and (D) are incorrect for the reasons stated.

(B)	
When Johnson took the ring to Defendant's pawnshop and borrowed $20 on it upon
condition that Defendant could keep the ring absent repayment within 60 days, a  bailment sit-
uation was created. Defendant was given  lawful possession of the ring, not mere custody.
Defendant's subsequent sale of the ring amounted to a conversion—serious interference with
the owner's rights to his property—sufficient for  embezzlement.  Embezzlement is the fraudu-
lent conversion of the personal property of another by one already in lawful possession.
Choice (B) is therefore correct.

(C)	
Larceny is defined as the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal prop-
erty of another with the intent to steal it. When Rufus took the case of beer off the truck and
hid it underneath the loading dock, a "taking" and "carrying away" occurred. According to
LaFave, the caption  (taking) requires the securing of dominion over another's property, while
the distance required for the asportation  (carrying away) need not be substantial – a slight dis-
tance will do. LaFave, p. 715. Finally, there must be concurrence  between the defendant's
conduct (actus reus) and the intent to steal (mens rea). At the time Rufus hid the case of beer
he intended to take it home rather than return it to the stock room, Rufus went beyond a mere
attempt, he committed larceny. Choice (C) is correct. Choice (A) is incorrect because at the
time of taking,  Rufus did not intend to return the beer. Restoration in this situation, is no
defense.

(C)	
Choice (A) is wrong because at common law arson consisted of the (1) malicious (or
intentional) (2) burning (3) of a dwelling (4) of another. Here, Perry set fire to Williams' tele-
vision outside his home. Choice (B) is incorrect because Perry did not intend to commit a lar-
ceny or felony at the time he broke into Williams' home. According to the facts, Perry decid-
ed to burn the television (which, in essence, constituted a larceny) after entering Williams'
home. Therefore, choice (C) is the best answer because by burning the television, Perry has
destroyed it thereby permanently depriving Williams of its use.

(B)	
Obviously, Enzo is guilty of conspiracy to commit assault because he entered into an
agreement with Shiller to threaten Rose. Secondly, Enzo committed a larceny by stealing the
watch when he was leaving Rose's home. No burglary occurred because Enzo did not have
the intent to commit a larceny or felony  at the time of the breaking and entering.  His intent
was to commit an assault which at common law was a misdemeanor, not a felony. Likewise,
Enzo is not guilty of robbery because the taking of the watch was not accomplished by force
or violence but occurred as an afterthought to the assault.

(B)	
False pretenses occurs when D tells Victim a (1) lie of a (2) past or present  fact, (not
a future fact or broken promise) which is (3) relied on by the Victim and (4) title to property
passes to D and (5) D has intent to defraud the Victim. Choice (B) is the correct answer. Here
D lied about the friendship with the Victim's boss, his employment and the loss of his wallet.
Victim relied on D's lies and passed title to the property ($100). Choice (A) is larceny by trick.
If D receives only possession of property because of a lie, the crime is larceny by trick, not
false pretenses. Choice (C) is embezzlement. The elements of embezzlement are: (1) D has
lawful possession of the property of another, which (2) D fraudulently converts, (3) with intent
to defraud. In choice (C), D obtained lawful possession when he rented the motorcycle. Later,
he sold it to Stranger which is the conversion element. A lie by a Defendant after acquiring
possession or title to the property cannot be larceny by trick or false pretenses. Choice (D) is
larceny. Here D did not lie to acquire possession or title to the gasoline, and did not acquire
lawful possession before he stole it.

(C) For the crime of solicitation to be committed, it is only necessary that the defendant
(with the requisite intent) have enticed, advised, incited, ordered or otherwise encouraged
another person to commit a crime. LaFave points out that in situations such as these where the
soliciting party would not be held guilty of the completed crime (if it were committed as a
result of the solicitation), the act of soliciting is itself not criminal. Criminal Law, pg. 493.
Since Blake was not actually selling narcotics, he cannot be guilty of solicitation. Therefore,
choices (A) and (D) are wrong. Also, choice (B) is incorrect because in  United States v.
Oviedo, 525 F. 2d 881 (1976) the Court held that legal impossibility precluded a defendant
from being guilty of attempted sale of heroin which turned out to be a non-narcotic substance.
Therefore, choice (C) is the best answer if Blake intended to defraud Yosi by selling him
oregano instead of marijuana.

(A) Always remember the best way to answer Multistate questions is by process of
elimination, especially when the correct "pick" isn't obvious (which is usually the case).
Choice (B) is wrong because embezzlement covers the misappropriation of either per-
sonal or real property. Embezzlement is broader than larceny which at common law was
limited to the theft of personal property. Nonetheless, Millie is not guilty of embezzlement
because we are dealing with a child, not personal or real property. Likewise, choice (D) is
incorrect because the original English  false pretenses statute covered only "money, goods,
wares or merchandise," and thus was limited to tangible personal property and money. By
the same token, Millie is not guilty of kidnapping, which is the forcible abduction of a per-
son. Since we are not dealing with abduction by force, choice (C) is incorrect. Therefore,
by process of elimination (A) is the best choice.

(D) Any jury instruction that creates a presumption of an element of a crime is unconsti-
tutional, as a denial of due process, because it shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. The
prosecution must prove every element of a charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt, which
cannot be shifted to the defendant. See, e.g. Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979).
Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307 (1985). Choice (A) is incorrect because this statute is not a
strict liability crime, because the defendant must "know" the sexual partner is under age 16.
Choice (B) is incorrect. The statute does not require or impart any legal duty to ascertain a sex
partner's age. Choice (C) is not the best choice. Whether Doofus "knowingly" had intercourse
with an underage partner (Bunny) is ultimately a jury question. Thus, choice (D) is correct by
elimination.

(D) There is no constitutional right to a jury trial for petty offenses, but only for serious
offenses, e.g., felonies. For purposes of the right to a jury trial, an offense is serious if impris-
onment for more than six months is authorized. Since the maximum imprisonment was seven
months, Piggy would be entitled to a jury trial. By the same token, a defendant has a right to
counsel for misdemeanor offenses if there is the possibility of imprisonment. According to the
holding in Alabama v. Shelton,  122 S. Ct. 1784 (2002), a suspended sentence that may end up
in the actual deprivation of a person's liberty (i.e., imprisonment) may not be imposed under
the Sixth Amendment unless the indigent defendant was provided the assistance of counsel in
the prosecution of the crime charged. Choice (D) is the best answer because the judge's
instruction was incorrect with respect to both the right to a jury trial and the right to counsel.

(C) A commonly tested area on the Multistate Exam is that of  standing, both in
Constitutional Law, as well as in Criminal Procedure. In Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128 (1978)
a passenger who had no property interest in an automobile was held not to have standing to
challenge a search of the vehicle as to items seized from it. This decision is founded on the
principle of no reasonable expectation of privacy. To have Fourth Amendment standing, a per-
son must show that his own rights were violated. Standing is proper if a person  owns or has
a right to possession of the place or thing searched, or if the place searched is the person's
home. Since Morgan, not Defendant, owned the car, Defendant has no standing to object to
the search. Choice (C) is therefore correct. Students should note further that  Rakas held that
being "legitimately on the premises" is insufficient grounds to assert standing by itself, with-
out proof of some possessory interest. Also, note that testimony given by the defendant to
assert standing may not be admitted substantively against him at trial  [Simmons v. United
States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968)].

(C) This question presents a fine-line hornbook distinction in Criminal Procedure dealing
with inventory searches. When an arrested person has been detained at a police station he may
be subjected to a rather complete search of his person, either incident to lawful arrest or as an
inventory incident to his booking into jail. An inventory is considered a search for Fourth
Amendment purposes and is generally upheld since it protects the arrestee's property, and also
protects the police from claims of not properly safeguarding the arrestee's property.
Specifically, the issue presented is whether the arrestee's person and effects may be searched
during incarceration. An inventory of all the defendant's items done contemporaneously with
the booking is permissible. Rowdy was booked late at night, and while in custody at some
time before his arraignment the next morning, the police, acting on a tip, discovered the dia-
mond ring identified in the burglary. Such a search incident to an inventory was proper, so
Rowdy's motion to exclude will be denied. Choice (C) is correct. Choice (D) is incorrect
because it does not represent the majority view and applies only if the arrestee has no priva-
cy interest in the effects being held for him. Under the prevailing view of  United States v.
Edwards (1974), the police have "custody" of a prisoner's property during the incarceration
and they may reasonably do so during the entire incarceration period whatever "they were
entitled to do incident to the usual custodial arrest and incarceration." LaFave, p. 149.

42. (B) A search occurs whenever the government infringes on a person's reasonable
expectation of privacy; a privacy expectation that society is prepared to recognize as rea-
sonable. U.S. v Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984). In Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405
(2005), the Supreme Court ruled that a dog sniff of the exterior of a car during a lawful
traffic stop is not a "search" because of the limited intrusion by the dog. The result is that
neither consent by the owner of the vehicle nor reasonable suspicion of drugs is required
provided (1) the stop of the vehicle is lawful, and (2) the stop is not "prolonged beyond the
time reasonably required to complete the mission." In short, government "conduct that
does not compromise any legitimate interest in privacy is not a search subject to the Fourth
Amendment; any interest in possessing contraband cannot be deemed 'legitimate' ."
Caballes at 407. See also, U.S. v Place 462 U.S. 696 (1983), (sniff by well-trained nar-
cotics detection dog of luggage at airport held, no search). Thus, choices (A), (C), and (D)
are incorrect. Choice (B) is based on  Kyllo v. U.S.  523 U.S. 27 (2001), where the Supreme
Court ruled that the use of a thermal-imaging device to detect the growth of marijuana in
a home constituted an unlawful search. The distinguishing feature between  Kyllo  and
Caballes is that Kyllo  involved a search of a house, but  Caballes involved a search of a
vehicle lawfully stopped on a public street. In addition, see:  Smith v. Maryland,  442 U.S.
735 (1979), (police examination of defendant's telephone records to determine numbers
dialed, held not a search compromising a person's reasonable expectation of privacy); and
U.S. v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109 (1984) (subjecting suspected substance to a chemical field
test for the presence of contraband, held no search, if the substance has lawfully been
seized). Thus, only choice (B) is a "search" under the Fourth Amendment. (Kyllo).

(B) According to the "open fields" doctrine, any unoccupied or undeveloped area outside
of the curtilage (even if fenced or posted with no trespassing signs, such as wooded areas,
desert, vacant lots in urban areas, open beaches, reservoirs, and open waters) is  not afforded
Fourth Amendment protection. Specifically, it was held to be no search to engage in aerial
photography of the outdoor areas of a large fenced-in industrial complex. See Dow Chemical
Co. v. United States,  90 L.Ed. 2d 226 (1986). Furthermore, use of police aircraft flying over
defendant's home and observing marijuana plants growing within the fenced curtilage was
held to be no search since the plants were readily discernable to the naked eye within a pub-
lic navigable airspace [California v. Ciraolo, 90 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1986)]. Choice (A) is wrong
because based upon the Dow Chemical and Ciraolo decisions, the conduct of the police was
not unlawful. Choice (C) is likewise incorrect because the marijuana was not the "fruit" of an
illegal search and seizure. Choice (D) is wrong because the police could enter Dumpor's farm
without a warrant since it was an "open field." Although the "open fields" doctrine was reaf-
firmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Oliver v. United States,  104 S. Ct. 1735 (1984), the dis-
senting Justices stated that "private land marked in a fashion sufficient to render entry there-
on a criminal trespass under the law of the state in which the land lies, is protected by the
Fourth Amendment's proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures."

(D) The consent search exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement is being
tested here. Any person with an apparent equal right to use or occupy the property may
consent to a search and any evidence found may be used against the occupants. See
U.S. v. Matlock  415 U.S. 164 (1973). For third party consent, joint access and control of the
premises is required. In our problem first and foremost, did Avis have authority "in her own
right" to allow the police to search her mother's bedroom? The answer is no. Although the
child may have had the apparent authority to permit the police to search common areas of the
home (e.g. living room or kitchen), Avis clearly did not have authority to allow the police to
search her mother's bedroom. Moreover, since Agnes locked the bedroom door, she did  not
assume the risk that her daughter would gain entry.

(B) It is important to note that under the holding in New York v. Belton,  453 U.S. 454
(1981), the search of an automobile incident to an arrest is generally permissible. Note,
however, the police are not justified in searching an automobile when the driver merely
receives a citation at the scene. There is disagreement as to whether  Belton also means the
search must be made before the arrestee is taken from the scene, but clearly it is unneces-
sary that he have continuing access to the car. Thus, LaFave states  "a search of a vehicle
under Belton is permissible even after the defendant has been removed from the car,
handcuffed and placed in a squad car, and even if he is in the custody of several offi-
cers." Criminal Procedure, pg. 203. The term "passenger compartment" in  Belton has
been construed to mean all areas reachable without exiting the vehicle, without regard to
the likelihood that such reaching actually occurred in the particular case.

(D) In United States v. Chadwick,  97 S.Ct. 2476 (1977), three persons were arrested for
transportation of marijuana, following which the police seized and later searched without a
warrant a double-locked footlocker which had just been put into the trunk of a car belonging
to one of the defendants. The Court declined to uphold the search, reasoning that vehicles have
a "diminished expectation of privacy" but that the footlocker did not because it was not open
to public view and it was "intended as a repository of personal effects." However, in
California v. Acevedo,  500 U.S. 565 (1991), the Supreme Court limited the breadth of
Chadwick and held that police may search an automobile and the containers within where they
have probable cause to believe contraband or evidence is contained. Accordingly in United
States v. Ross,  102 S.Ct. 2157 (1982), the Court held that if "probable cause justifies the
search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its
contents that may conceal the object of the search." Based upon the given facts, since the
police had probable cause to search the entire vehicle for drugs, the police may lawfully
search both the toolcase and the glove compartment.

(C) Many students will be inclined to choose either (A) or (B) thinking that the prosecu-
tion cannot comment on defendant's silence in closing arguments. Though that is generally
true, there is one important exception. In  Fletcher v. Weir, 455 U.S. 231 (1980), the court held
that if a defendant had not been given Miranda warnings, then the prosecution for impeach-
ment may comment on defendant's pre-arrest silence. The Court explained that this was not
"a case where the government had induced silence by implicitly assuring the defendant that
his silence would not be used against him."

(C) The Miranda right to silence can be waived either expressly or impliedly.  Miranda
waiver is based on voluntariness as determined by the "totality of circumstances." To deter-
mine if a knowing and intelligent waiver has occurred, the Court views both the (1)  compe-
tence of the defendant, i.e., age, experience, intelligence, and ability to fully understand the
warnings, and (2) the conduct of the police, namely as to whether there has been overreach-
ing. In the present example, choice (A) is wrong because defendants have generally been
unsuccessful in claiming that their Miranda waivers should be held invalid because they were
either intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or medication at that time. Likewise, choice
(B) is wrong inasmuch as the "personal characteristics of the defendant existing at the time of
the purported waiver are relevant only as they relate to police overreaching." See  Colorado v.
Connelly, 107 S.Ct. 515 (1986), where the Court rejected a state court ruling that a defendant's
Miranda waiver was not voluntary because he suffered from a psychosis that interfered with
his ability to make free and rational choices. The Court concluded that  "Miranda protects
defendants against government coercion but goes no further than that." As a result, choice (C)
is the best answer because Defendant was subjected to persistent questioning for two hours
before waiving his Miranda rights. According to LaFave, courts have held waivers invalid
where the defendant had been held in custody an extended period of time before being given
the warnings, or where the defendant had first been subjected to persistent questioning. Lastly,
choice (D) is incorrect because in Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707 (1979), the Court held that
a juvenile's request to have his probation officer present was not a per se invocation of
Miranda rights.

49. (B) The Massiah rule prohibits the police from using deliberate efforts to acquire incrimi-
nating information from a suspect who has been formally charged, unless the suspect's attor-
ney is present or the right to counsel has been waived. Here, Dave had been formally charged
and the police placed an informant in Dave's call with specific instruction to acquire informa-
tion from Dave about the charged crime. The fact that Innis was told not to question Dave is
insufficient because he purposely engaged Dave in conversation and bragged about his own
crimes intending to induce Dave to make incriminating statements. Since Dave's attorney was
not present, his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated. Choice (A) is not the best
choice. The Massiah rule protects the right to counsel, not the right to avoid self-incrimination.
There are no facts to suggest coercion or that any custodial interrogation took place. Choice (C)
is not the best choice. The fact that Dave received Miranda warnings does not render his state-
ments admissible. Quite the contrary, Dave requested counsel. Thus, he is entitled to have
counsel present during all critical stages of the criminal process. This includes the right to have
counsel present during all attempts by the police to elicit incriminating information from him
after formal charges. Once Dave had been arraigned (a formal charge), he cannot be subjected
to deliberate attempts by police agents to acquire incriminating statements from him without
his counsel being present. Choice (D) is not the best choice. Actual interrogation is not neces-
sary in order for police activity to violate the Massiah rule. The Supreme Court has ruled that
statements acquired from criminal defendants awaiting trial (after formal charges—indictment,
arraignment, etc.), are inadmissible when the police place an informant in the cell who active-
ly induces incriminating responses from the defendant. Maine v. Moulton  (1985). There need
not be actual questioning, just some activity deliberately designed to elicit incriminating state-
ments (Compare Kuhlmann v. Wilson  (1986) [Cellmate informant's testimony admissible
because informant made only one remark and was merely a passive listener]).

50. (D) The Fifth Amendment right to be free from double jeopardy for the same offense
prohibits retrial after a determination on the merits. In United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82
(1978), the Court held that "the defendant, by deliberately choosing to seek termination of
the proceedings against him on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the
offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy
Clause if the Government is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial court in
favor of the defendant." LaFave and Israel, Criminal Procedure, p. 910. Thus, the gener-
al rule is that reprosecution following dismissal by the judge upon the defendant's motion
which does not constitute an acquittal on the merits is not prohibited by the Double
Jeopardy Clause. In these facts, O'Teen's motion for dismissal at the first trial was grant-
ed by the judge based on an equal protection violation, not on any factual element of the
statutory offense charged. Hence, no double jeopardy has attached to bar O'Teen's munic-
ipal prosecution. Choice (A) is incorrect Therefore, O'Teen's motion to dismiss at the sec-
ond trial will be denied. Choice (D) properly states the correct rationale. Choice (B) is
incorrect because collateral estoppel bars retrial of issues that have been actually litigated.
O'Teen's first trial ended in dismissal without litigating any factual issues now being
raised at the second trial. Choice (C) is incorrect because the separate sovereignties doc-
trine does not apply to trials by a state and by its municipalities.

Multistate "Double Jeopardy" Variations:

Elvis and his girlfriend Priscilla broke into Bobby's
house late at night with the intent to steal his stereo
system. Although they beleived that Bobby was away
on a business trip, actually he was asleep in an upstairs
bedroom. While they were inside the house, Priscilla
announced that she had changed her mind and urged
Elvis to leave.

Bobby who was awakened by the noise downstairs,
descended the staircase to investigate. Upon seeing
Bobby, Priscilla again urged Elvis to flee. Instead,
Elvis attacked Bobby and then tied him up with rope.
thereupon, Elvis and Priscilla departed with Bobby's
stereo equipment. After they left, Bobby choked to
death from the ropes while trying to free himself.

Priscilla and Elvis were charged with burglary but
were acquitted. Thereafter, Priscilla and Elvis were
apprehended and prosecuted for felony murder with
the underlying felony being burglary.

I. With respect to Priscilla and Elvis' criminal liabili-
ty for felony murder, which of the following is
most correct?
(A) The burglary acquittal precludes any subse-
quent prosecution under the doctrine of  res judi-
cata.

(B) The burglary acquittal precludes any subse-
quent prosecution under the doctrine of collater-
al estoppel.

(C) The burglary acquittal precludes any subse-
quent prosecution under the doctrine of double
jeopardy.

(D) The burglary acquittal does not preclude sub-

sequent prosecution for felony murder.

Answer: (C)

While married Bonnie and Bill Black had a son
whom they named Beau. When Beau was fourteen
years of age, Bonnie died in a fiery auto crash. Six
months after the accident, Bill met and married Jill
Hill. Thereafter, Jill moved into Bill's home which
was located in the city of Boulder. Jill became very
fond of Beau and actually developed a sexual attach-
ment. After his mother's death, Beau was extremely
despondant and eagerly sought Jill's love and affec-
tion. One day while Bill was away on a business trip,
Jill engaged in a sexual act with Beau in their home-
town of Boulder. The following day, Jill took Beau on
a ski trip to Vail and again molested the youngster.
When Bill returned home, Jill confessed to her mis-
deeds and sought Bill's forgiveness.

2. If Jill is prosecuted for molesting her sepson, she

should be found guilty of
(A) one count of child molestation because
Boulder and Vail are located within the same
state

(B) one count of child molestation because two
convictions for the same criminal offense vio-
late double jeopardy
two counts of child molestation because sep-
aratecriminal offenses occured

(C)

(D) two counts of child molestation because
Boulder and Vail are separate sovereigns

ELEMENTS OF CRIMES

VOLITIONAL ACT — normally D must cause a criminally proscribed result by some voluntary affirmative act;  look for indicia of lack of volition or control such as
(1) epilepsy, (2) automatism, or (3) hypnotism (duress is not a volitional act defense).

ACT (ACTUS REUS) —  law
does not punish for thought
alone; D must do some
criminally cognizable act.

OMISSION — if D has a legal duty, failure to
act is sufficient.

VICARIOUS LIABILITY — D may be responsibl
for act of another

STATUTE — duty explicitly imposed by a statute (e.g., file tax returns).
CONTRACT — duty imposed by agreement (e.g., lifeguard, nurse).
SPECIAL DEPENDENCY — strong moral duty plus knowledge that person is dependent and
relying on D (e.g., aged relative, young child, seamen–sea captain).
DETRIMENTAL UNDERTAKING — if D commences to aid and leaves victim in worse position
(some states make the mere undertaking a basis for duty even without detriment).
CAUSATION — if D causes victim's plight, even without fault, some states require D to aid.

RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR —  acts of employees in strict liability regulatory crimes.
UNRESPONSIBLE AGENT — acts of unresponsible agent (e.g., a child or insane person)
caused by D.
ACCOMPLICE CONDUCT — reasonably foreseeable acts of an accomplice.
CO-CONSPIRATOR CONDUCT —  acts of co-conspirators done to further the conspiratorial
goal.

INTENT (MENS REA) — criminal law focuses
on the culpability (e.g., blameworthiness) of D
by examining his state of mind with regard to
the criminal consequence  (see Mens Rea JIG).

PURPOSEFUL — if D does an act with the conscious object of causing the criminal result.

KNOWING — if D does an act consciously aware of the fact that a criminal result is practically certain.

RECKLESS — if D is consciously aware of the fact that his act creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a criminal result will occur.

NEGLIGENT — if D creates an unreasonable risk that a criminal result will occur.

VOLUNTARY — if D does a volitional act which causes a criminal result  (i.e., strict liability).

CAUSATION — D's act must cause
the particular result proscribed by
the definition of the crime.

PROXIMATE CAUSE — must be the
cause-in-fact with no unforeseeable
intervening causes.

APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLE

CAUSE-IN-FACT

"But For" — but for D's act the result would not have occurred when it
occurred.

Substantial Factor — even if not "but for," D's act was a substantial factor
or an independently sufficient cause of the result.

INTERVENING CAUSES — D normally acts on a "set stage" including unforeseeable abnormalities of vic-
tim, but if an unforeseeable independent act intervenes between D's act and the criminal result,  D is not
responsible.

HOMICIDE — D must cause the death of another human being within one year of act.
FALSE PRETENSES — D's misrepresentation must cause V to give up title to property (i.e., V must  rely
on misrepresentation).
ATTEMPT — D need not cause intended result, manifested culpability is sufficient.
SOLICITATION — D need not be successful in inducing another, act of encouraging is sufficient.
CONSPIRACY — formation of criminal combination is social harm, intended crime need  not be carried out.
BURGLARY — D must actually break and enter with the requisite criminal intent, intended crime need  not
be committed.
POSSESSION CRIMES —  D must knowingly possess illegal item (e.g., concealed weapon, drugs,
burglary tool) but he need not use them.

Intentional, Deliberate, Willful (Purposeful) —  words requiring an act with the  conscious object
to cause a particular result (regardless of the likelihood of achieving result).
Knowingly, With Knowledge — requiring conscious awareness that conduct is practically certain
to cause a particular result (regardless of D's desire to cause result).

SPECIFIC INTENT —  purpose

Recklessly, Maliciously —  requiring that D is consciously aware that his act creates a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that a particular result will be caused.
Criminal Negligence — more than "mere negligence," requiring that D's conduct manifest a
gross and culpable departure from standards of reasonableness  with regard to a particular result
(D need not be aware of risk). Normally, only used in homicide cases dealing with autos, guns,
drugs, or risk of fire.
Statutory Construction —  a statute proscribing conduct without specifying level of mens rea is
normally construed to require recklessness.

GENERAL INTENT — D must 	
be at least grossly and culpably

MENS REA DEFENSES — none, strict liability requires only a voluntary act.

DETERMINING
MENTAL STATE

PRESUMPTION — D is presumed to intend to cause the natural and probable consequences  of his conduct.
EVIDENCE OF INTENT —  look for direct statements by D or circumstantial evidence (such as motive) which tend to indicate D's state of mind with respect to the criminally
proscribed consequences.

INSANITY	

M'NAGHTEN TEST (majority rule) —  D not criminally responsible if (1)  at the time of the offense  D was (2) laboring under such a defect of reason
from a disease of the mind  as (3) not to know (a) the nature and quality of his act  or, if he did know it, (b)  he did not know that the act was wrong.
IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE (supplementary M'Naghten in many states) —  D not criminally responsible if (1)  at the time of the offense, D (2) was
unable to control his conduct (3) as a result of mental disease.
ALI/MPC TEST — D not criminally responsible if (1) at the time of the offense, (2) as a result of mental disease or defect, she (3) lacks substantial
capacity to either (a) appreciate the criminality of her conduct,  or (b) to conform her conduct to the requirements of the law.
PROOF — insanity is an affirmative defense, but once D introduces evidence of insanity, burden of proof shifts to prosecutor to show D is not
insane.
COMPETENCY — regardless of D's mental state at the time of the offense, an accused  cannot be tried for a crime if (1) at the time of trial, she is
(2) (a) incapable of understanding the nature of the proceedings, or (b) of assisting in her defense in a rational or reasonable manner.

MENS REA
DEFENSES

DIMINISHED	
RESPONSIBILITY	

MENTAL DEFICIENCY — about 12 states permit evidence of mental deficiency short of insanity to negate deliberation requirements of first degree
murder; California allows mental illness to negate malice aforethought and reduce an intentional murder to voluntary manslaughter.
INTOXICATION — involuntary intoxication  is a defense to any crime; it may negate a required mental state  if D is so intoxicated that he did not
understand the criminal nature of his conduct; voluntary intoxication  may (1) negate specific intent element of an offense  if (2) before he formulates
the criminal intent he (3) becomes so intoxicated that he lacked the capacity for culpability.

INFANCY — children under 7 cannot crimes; 7-14, child presumed incapable of crime, but prosecution can rebut with evidence that child actually understood his conduct
was wrong; over 14 children may be treated as adults (subject to state juvenile laws).

MISTAKE OF FACT

SPECIFIC INTENT CRIMES —  any material mistake of fact (whether reasonable or unreasonable) negates specific intent.
GENERAL INTENT CRIMES — a reasonable mistake of material fact negates recklessness or negligence required by general intent crime.

MISTAKE OF LAW — generally no defense, but MPC allows defense if (1) D  reasonably relied upon official interpretation of a law which was later declared invalid;
(2) without fault, D was not apprised of administrative rule; (3) if knowledge of legal status is an element of the offense;  or (4) where statute requires an affirmative act.

ATTEMPTS

D is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if: (1) with the specific intent to cause a criminal result,  he (2) does some legally sufficient act toward the
commission of the intended crime.

SPECIFIC INTENT — D must be either purposeful or knowing with regard to causing the result proscribed by the underlying crime; always look for specific intent defenses, especially
intoxication and exculpating mistake. Remember, specific intent is required for all attempts, even if substantive crime is strict liability (e.g., attempted bigamy).

SUFFICIENT ACT —
must be beyond mere
preparation; a ques-
tion of law for
the judge.

IMPOSSIBILITY

LAST ACT — the last act required of D is always sufficient, even if subsequent acts of another are necessary (e.g., P puts poison in V's pills on nightstand).

UNEQUIVOCAL ACT —  if D's act unequivocally manifests criminal intent it is sufficient (very often even the last act does not do this, however).

CORROBORATING ACT — best view focuses upon the significance of D's act in demonstrating that D had the firm and present intent to commit the crime
(under this view the act must corroborate the existence of firm intent).

FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY — if crime would have resulted had the facts been as D thought they were, impossibility is no defense: (1) inherently inadequate
instrumentality (D mistakes sugar for poison); (2)  error in time or place (D attempts to "pick" an empty pocket, or kill a person already dead). Factual impossibility
is based upon a mistake which does  not negate culpability (i.e., D is worse than he appears).

STATUS OF GOODS — some courts hold that D cannot be guilty of an attempt to possess stolen property if property
possessed is not in fact "stolen" (i.e., true owner consented to use of property to apprehend D). Under this view, a mistake
as to the legal status of a thing provides a valid defense. Most courts and MPC treat this as factual impossibility (rather
than legal impossibility) and deny the defense.

LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY

INTENDED RESULT IS NOT ILLEGAL — if D believes an act is illegal but it is not, he cannot be guilty of an attempt
simply by doing that act since the conduct actually intended is not regarded as socially harmful, thus, D must manifest a
willingness to do an act actually proscribed by law.

DEFINITION OF CRIME EXCLUDES D —  if, according to the definition of a crime, it is impossible for D to commit the
substantive offense, there can be no attempt by D.

ABANDONMENT — crime of attempt is complete once a legally sufficient act has been committed, but some courts and MPC allow a defense if D (1) voluntarily abandons the criminal act
(2) prior to completion of the substantive crime (3) under circumstances manifesting a complete renunciation of criminal intent.  Look for extrinsic causes of withdrawal which are  not defenses
(e.g., fear of apprehension, selection of a different victim, etc.)

have the specific intent with
regard to a criminal objective.

(1) Agreement between (2) two or more persons (3) who have the specific intent (4) to either (a) commit a crime or (b) to engage in dishonest, fraudulent or immoral
conduct injurious to public health or morals.

AGREEMENT SUFFICIENT — at common law, the agreement itself is the only act required to complete the crime; federal and about half of states now require some  additional
overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy (although the act need not be illegal in itself and only one conspirator need do an act).
PROOF — agreement may be inferred from concert of action (look for mutual adoption of a common purpose).
FALSE AGREEMENT — secret police agent or other "false agreement" situations are not conspiracies — there must be true actual intent to carry out unlawful objective by at
least two parties. (MPC is contra; party with true intent is still liable).
UNKNOWN CONSPIRATORS — D must agree with at least one other person but need not agree with (or even know identity of) all other members of the conspiracy.
SINGLE OR MULTIPLE CONSPIRACY —  the agreement is the essence of conspiracy; thus, there is only one conspiracy even if agreement encompasses separate diverse
criminal acts and even if agreement entails a continuous course of criminal conduct.

STATUS DEFENSE TO SUBSTANTIVE CRIME — if D conspires with B, it is no defense to either party that D may not be capable under the legal definition to commit underlying
crime himself (e.g., a man cannot rape his own wife).
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY — that one party is immune from prosecution is no defense to other party.
DIMINISHED CAPACITY DEFENSES —  if B, the only other conspirator, possesses a diminished capacity defense negating specific intent (e.g., intoxication, infancy, insanity), a
few courts preclude conviction of D as well as B; better view including MPC permits convictions of D regardless of B's  personal mens rea defenses.
ACQUITTAL ON MERITS — if B, the only other conspirator, is acquitted on the merits (i.e., not because of procedural or personal mens rea defenses), D may not be convicted.
HUSBAND-WIFE — today, D may conspire with a spouse (not so at old common law).

WHARTON'S RULE 	

Consent Crimes — if crime logically requires the voluntary participation of another (e.g., bribery, incest, adultery, gambling), there is no conspiracy
unless agreement involves  an additional person not logically essential.
 Plurality Required by Substantive Crime —  if substantive crime requires a number of participants (e.g., 5 or more conducting gambling operations),
there can be no separate charge of conspiracy  unless agreement involves persons who are not guilty of the substantive crime itself.
Model Penal Code — abandons Wharton's Rule.

MENS REA DEFENSES APPLY —  D may assert any mens rea defenses which negate specific intent.
PURPOSEFUL AGREEMENT — it is always sufficient that D enters the agreement with the conscious object of causing, promoting or facilitating a result which he knows to be
criminal.
CORRUPT MOTIVE DOCTRINE —  many states require that D actually had a  corrupt motive (that he knew that intended conduct was illegal) except where the act is inherently
wrong.

SUPPLIER CASES — D's "agreement"	
consists of providing goods or services 	
which he knows will be used to commit	
a crime.	

Mere Knowledge — normally not sufficient, but conviction is possible if: (1) goods supplied are  highly dangerous (e.g.,
explosives), or highly regulated (e.g., drugs); (2) the crime is very serious (e.g., homicide, kidnapping); (3) there is  continuous
involvement, or (4) if D affirmatively encouraged use more of his goods when he had reason to know that the use was illegal.
Knowledge Plus Stake — D may be convicted if he  knows that his goods or services are used for a criminal purpose and he
has a "stake" in the success of the criminal objective (e.g., D charges an inflated price).

CONSPIRATORIAL —
OBJECTIVE

CRIME — it is a conspiracy to agree to commit any crime, including a misdemeanor.
PUBLICLY INJURIOUS ACT — it is a conspiracy to agree with another to do any act (even if lawful) which is injurious to public health or morals and is accomplished by
dishonest, fraudulent, corrupt or immoral means (MPC and some states are  contra limiting conspiracies to "crimes").

DEFENSES	

ABANDONMENT — once a conspiracy has been formed, it is no defense that D subsequently withdrew, even if done prior to the completion of the underlying crime. (MPC and some states  contra,
but only if D: (1) completely renounces criminal purpose,  and (2) makes substantial efforts to prevent the commission of the underlying crime.)
IMPOSSIBILITY — factual impossibility is not a defense though D may prevail if the conspiratorial objective is simply not illegal, regardless of D's contrary belief.

SPECIAL CONSEQUENCES

SEPARATE OFFENSE — conspiracy is a separate offense, distinct from the underlying crime (i.e., there is no merger).
VENUE — a criminal charge may be brought in any county where some act in furtherance was committed by any party,  or where the agreement was made.
HEARSAY EVIDENCE — in a trial for conspiracy, otherwise inadmissable hearsay statements of co-conspirators are admissible against D if  made in furtherance of the conspiracy.

VICARIOUS LIABILITY	

General Rule — in addition to conspiracy and the substantive crime intended, D may be convicted of other crimes committed by members of
conspiracy in furtherance of conspiratorial goal (it is no defense that D did not intend nor know of the acts.)
Chain Conspiracy — if D is part of a "chain" of known illegal acts (e.g., smuggling–wholesaling–retailing of drugs), he is liable for all crimes
committed to further the conspiratorial goal (look for  "community of interest").
Wheel Conspiracy — if D conspires with B and B enters into similar separate and unrelated agreements for similar crimes with X and Y,
B is the "hub" of a "wheel conspiracy;" if there is a  community of interest  so that D,X, and Y are interested in the success of each other's
agreements with B, there is a "rim" connecting all the "spokes" in one conspiracy and all parties are liable for the criminal acts of the others. If
there is no community of interest, there are 3 separate conspiracies and only B is liable for the acts of all others (as well as for 3 conspiracies).

ATTEMPTED CONSPIRACY (SOLICITATION) —  one who attempts to induce, encourage or command another to commit a crime is guilty of solicitation; if the other person agrees there is conspiracy.

DURATION — vicarious liability lasts until the goal of the conspiracy is achieved (including  immediate escape) or D withdraws by informing all co-conspirators. (In many states, D must make some substantial effort to
prevent the crime.)

CRIMINAL HOMICIDE ISSUES

Issue Spotting Sequence: (1)  Is D responsible for an act causing the death? (2 )Was D's act the  cause of the death? (3) Was the act directed at  another person? (4) Was the person living at the time of the act?
(5) Did D possess a criminal intent with respect to the death? (6) Was there any legal justification?

Voluntary Affirmative Act —  act is sufficient even if it is itself lawful and/or inherently non dangerous. If immediate killing act was involuntary due to epileptic seizure or sudden unconsciousness,
look to see whether the last voluntary act done by D was done with awareness of possibility of loss of control.

ACT

Omission — death caused by D's failure to do an act he had a legal duty to do as the result of: (1) special statute, (2) contractual delegation, (3) special relationship of dependency, (4) voluntary
undertaking (if abandonment puts victim in worse position) or (5) D's innocent act imperils victim.

Vicarious Liability — D is responsible for homicidal acts of: (1) unresponsible agents put into motion by D, (2) accomplices—if act was reasonably foreseeable, and (3) co-conspirators—if act
was done in furtherance of the conspiratorial goal (whether it was foreseeable or not).

Cause-in-fact 	

But For — D's act was a necessary condition of result; "but for" the act, the victim would have lived longer.
 Independently Sufficient — even if not the "but for" cause, D's act was sufficient in itself to produce result.
Substantial Factor — even if not either the "but for" cause or an independently sufficient cause, D's act was at least a substantial factor in producing result.

CAUSE

Proximate Cause	

Outside Time Limit — at common law, the victim must die within a year and a day of the injury inflicted by D. Modern states extend time up to 3 years.
Pre-existing Conditions — D "takes his victim as he finds him" and acts on a "set stage," therefore, even unknown and unforeseeable pre-existing conditions which
contribute to V's death do  not intervene to break the chain of causations. Though D is criminally responsible for the direct results of his conduct from a causation stand
point, unusually unforeseeable conditions may create a mens rea defense.
Intervening Causes — a separate event or act which occurs between D's cause-in-fact conduct and the death will  supercede D's act and break the chain of causation if
the intervening act or event was: (1) Independently sufficient  to cause the death, (2) unforeseeable, and (3) an independent act of god or another person not directly and
logically flowing from D's act. (Some courts will also relieve D of responsibility if the intervening force was  dependent). Failure of intervening rescue does not break the
chain of causation.

DEATH OF ANOTHER — suicidal acts and attempts are not sufficient for homicide though many states separately punish attempted suicides especially if they endanger or injure innocent persons.

LIVING PERSON

Unborn Infants — a victim has to be "born alive" and separated from its mother before homicide responsibility can arise. Some courts hold that a "viable" unborn fetus is a person for homicide
purposes if it was sufficiently developed to be capable of living independently from its mother. State has right to declare a fetus "alive" after the first trimester of pregnancy.  Roe v Wade.
Comatose Victims — death occurs at the moment all bodily functions permanently cease, and not before. Because of live sustaining equipment that can support biological life and minimal body
functions long after irreparable deterioration of the brain, the notion of "brain death" is a possible alternative.

CRIMINAL INTENT —  homicide crimes are "graded" in
terms of the culpability of D with respect to the death
(See MIG 5A) but the following mental states are suffi-
cient for some form of criminal homicide.

Specific Intent to Kill — D has the specific intent to kill if he is either  knowing or purposeful with regard to the death. This includes willful, deliberate,
premeditated and deliberate killings. Unless justified, all intentional killings are either murder or voluntary manslaughter. Intent to kill is an express
form of malice aforethought.

Unintentional Killings — D can be guilty of criminal homicide even if there was no intent to kill at the time of the death-causing act. Unintentional
killings may either be murder or manslaughter but intent is criminal if D: (1) intends to cause great bodily harm, a forcible felony or resist a known
lawful arrest, (sufficient states for implied malice aforethought and, therefore, murder), (2) was  reckless with regard to the death (wanton reckless
disregard for human life is an extreme form sufficient for murder), (3) was  criminally negligent with regard to the death,  or (4) intends to commit a
malum in se unlawful act (or inherently dangerous crime) not amounting to a forcible felony.

LEGAL JUSTI-
FICATION (See
MIG 7)

Self Defense — at the time of the act D (1) reasonably believed (2) that the amount of force used was necessary to protect himself from (3)  imminent (4) great bodily harm or death.
D may not be aggressor and, in minority of states, he must retreat before using deadly force if he knows he can do so with complete safety (except in his own home).

Defense of Other — D's act was (1) done  in defense of another person  and (2) the person defended had a legal right to use the same amount of force used by D.  D "stands in the
shoes" of the person defended and his conduct is judged in terms of actual facts. MPC, N.Y., and modern view permit defense if D reasonably believed that person defended would
have been legally justified in using the force employed by D. Some states require person defended to be a close relative.

Prevention of Crime — D's act was intended to (1) prevent commission of a forcible felony (e.g., burglary, arson, robbery, rape, kidnapping, felonius assault) which (2) was  actually
being committed and (3) the force used was reasonably believed necessary.  MPC, N.Y., and modern view judge D in terms of his reasonable belief about the commission of the
felony, not the actual facts.

Apprehension of Dangerous Felon —  D's act was (1) done to effectuate an arrest or prevent escape of a person who had (2) actually (3) had committed a forcile felony,  (4) the
force used reasonably appeared to be necessary,  and (5) the act did not unreasonably endanger innocent bystanders.  If D is a peace officer his conduct will be judged in terms of
his reasonable belief as to the commission of the underlying felony, not by the actual facts.

Necessity — D's act was (1) done to prevent imminent loss of life (2) under circumstances where  according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality  (3) the harm sought to
be avoided outweighed the harm caused by the act.

Defenses not available — deadly force is not justified on a theory of duress, entrapment, defense of property (though if victim was committing a burglary or robbery prevention of a
forcible felony justifies a killing); or  consent ("mercy killing" or euthanasia is not a recognized defense but it can mitigate sentencing).

HOMICIDE CRIMES

Intent to Kill — Includes both purposeful (conscious object) and knowing (practically certain) killings. Specific intent defenses available to negate mens rea.  Under modern
statutes, if intent to kill is supplemented by  deliberation and premeditation (mental states revealing a relatively calm, "cold-blooded," reflective killing as opposed to a sudden,
impulsive or spontaneous killing). If victim does not die, D is guilty of attempted murder.

Unintentional Killing — Wanton Reckless Disregard for Life —  Unintended killing resulting from an act done with a conscious and knowing disregard of a plain and strong
likelihood that an unjustified death or serious injury will result.  Any facts which negate conscious awareness of the risk may prevent mens rea (but voluntary intoxication may
not negate recklessness). More than "mere recklessness;" act must reveal a wanton depraved indifference to human life. If victim does not die, no attempted murder since no
specific intent to kill.

Unintentional Killing — Intent to Cause Great Bodily harm (GBH) —  Unintended killing resulting from an act done with the purpose or knowledge that it cause  serious
protracted injury or create a substantial risk of death (very similar to recklessness). Includes any intentional wounding with a gun or knife, breaking of bones, clubbing, poisoning
or an act designed to produce unconsciousness by drugs or violence. Intent to do GBH may be negated by mistake, extreme intoxication, and in minority, by diminished mental
capacity. If victim does not die, no attempted murder. Under modern statutes unintended death resulting from  intentional use of poison or explosives, torture,  or ambush (lying in
wait) is first degree.

Unintentional Killing — Intent to Resist Known Lawful Arrest —  Unintended killing resulting from act done in resistance of a  known lawful arrest. D must actually know that
the arrest is under lawful authority and mens rea defenses may negate that knowledge. If victim does not die, no attempted murder.

Unintentional Killing — Intent to Commit a Felony —  Unintended killing proximately caused by and
during the commission of a felony or an attempted felony. Wide state variations as to the  nature of the
underlying felony (most limit to forcible felonies — burglary, arson, robbery, rape, kidnapping), the  degree
of offense (usually first degree), and special limitations (usually as to the status of the killer or victim).  No
attempted murder if victim does not die.

Special Limitations — modern view permits felony
murder (FM) only if D or a criminal accomplice directly
kills the victim and where victim is an innocent person
(not an accomplice)

Underlying Felony Must be Proved —  any defense
to the underlying felony (e.g., claim of right to a
burglary or robbery) absolves D of FM responsibility.

Perpetration — felony includes period from attempt
(i.e., act beyond preparation) through immediate flight
until final rest.

Intentional Killing — Provocation —  Intentional killing done in the  heat of passion caused by legally sufficient provocation  (actual or threatened battery or perceived infidelity —
not mere words). Provocation must be such that it might render a reasonable ordinary person to lose self control and act rashly. "Cooling off" period between provocation and
killing act destroys defense. Normal range of physical and temperamental defects are  not taken into account but extreme disabilities of a permanent nature  may be considered
by a liberal court. Modern trend is to liberalize types of legally sufficient provocation and focus on culpability; MPC allows any "extreme emotional disturbance" regardless of
cause. If victim does not die, some courts hold D for  attempted voluntary manslaughter; others only for felonious assault.

Intentional Killing — Mistaken Justification —  Intentional killing done with an  actual but unreasonable or erroneous belief that the act was legally justified. Includes use of
excessive force, unreasonable belief that harm was imminent, error as to the rights of a person being defended, etc. — called  imperfect defense. If victim does not die, some
convict of attempted voluntary manslaughter; others felonious assault.

Intentional Killing — Diminished Capacity —  While most states allow evidence of mental defect short of insanity and extreme intoxication to negate the "premeditation" aspect
(reducing a charge to second degree murder), a small minority go further and permit a showing of diminished mental capacity to  negate malice aforethought and reduce the
charge to voluntary manslaughter. Diminished capacity applies only to homicide charges.

Unintentional Killing — Ordinary Recklessness — Unintended killing resulting from an act done with a  conscious disregard for a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death or
serious injury but one that does not demonstrate a wanton depraved indifference to human life. The distinction between ordinary recklessness resulting in involuntary
manslaughter and depraved recklessness resulting in murder is merely a question of degree to be determined as an issue of fact.

Unintentional Killing — Gross and Culpable Negligence — Unintended killing resulting from a negligent act which reveals a wanton disregard of the risk of death or serious
injury. More than ordinary negligence, it must be gross and culpable but it is not required that the prosecutor prove that D was consciously aware of the risk (compare to
recklessness). Normally deals with mishandling of an  inherently dangerous instrumentality  (e.g., guns, explosives, automobiles),  product (e.g., food and drugs) or situation (e.g.,
risk of fire in a public place).

Unintentional Killing — Unlawful Act Rule — Unintended killing proximately caused by and during the commission or attempted commission of a malum in se (i.e., wrong in
itself) misdemeanor or felony (if jurisdiction limits FM rule to forcible felonies). Sometimes called the misdemeanor-manslaughter rule. Many states apply rule only to  inherently
dangerous crimes or non-dangerous crimes committed in an unusual and inherently dangerous manner. Look for this possibility whenever FM fails.

Unintentional Killing — Provocation and Mistaken Justification —  Unintended killing resulting from an act only intended to wound or frighten  done in the heat of passion
with legally sufficient provocation or in an honest but erroneous belief that the force used was legally justified,  (compare to voluntary manslaughter where the intent was to kill).

MURDER
Unlawful killing with malice
aforethought, no degrees
of murder at common law.

VOLUNTARY
MANSLAUGHTER
An intentional murder
"mitigated" by facts negating
malice aforethought.

INVOLUNTARY
MANSLAUGHTER

killing without malice
aforethought.

COMMON LAW BURGLARY

(1) Trespassory (2) breaking and (3) entering (4) a dwelling (5) in the nighttime
(6) with specific intent to: (a) commit a larceny or (b) any felony (7) therein.

TRESPASSORY — entry must be without consent, but entry gained by misrepresentation of identity or other trick is trespassory.

BREAKING — D must create or enlarge the opening for his entry; includes opening an unlocked door or raising a partially open window, but D need not actually "break." In many states,
unlawful "remaining" in a store after closing is a constructive breaking, though common law requires that the breaking must be done to gain entry, not to exit. Some states abandon the breaking
requirement entirely.

ENTERING — D must physically intrude victim's property.

D'S BODY — any portion of D's body is sufficient.

INSTRUMENT — any tool or hook invading the property is sufficient if it is used to achieve the criminal purpose
(as opposed to using it to merely gain entry).

INCLUDES CURTILAGE — structures immediately surrounding the dwelling (e.g., enclosed in the area of the
"yard") and physically connected buildings.

DWELLING — structure must be a place where one  normally
sleeps (though it need not be occupied at the time of entry).

INCLUDES BOATS AND TRAILERS WHERE PEOPLE SLEEP

MODERN STATUTES EXTEND TO ALL "ENCLOSED STRUCTURES" ABANDONING THE DWELLING
REQUIREMENT

NIGHTTIME — entry must occur 30 minutes before sunset or after sunrise. This requirement is  abandoned under modern "breaking and entering" statutes.

SPECIFIC INTENT

LARCENY

Intent to Commit Any Larceny is Sufficient (even if petty larceny)
Be Sure all Elements of Larceny are Specifically Intended: (1)  trespassory taking, (2) carrying away, (3) personal property,
(4) known to be owned by another, (5) intent to permanently deprive. The claim of right defense is particularly likely to arise, if it does,
there is no burglary.

THEREIN — D must intend to commit the crime  in the dwelling (or enclosed structure); it is not sufficient that D broke and entered only to get to another place.

ANY FELONY — intent to commit any felony is sufficient, but look for defenses to the underlying felony.

JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF
FORCE

SELF-DEFENSE — if D has a
(1) reasonable fear of (2) imminent
(3) bodily harm he may use (4) that
amount of force which is reasonably
necessary to prevent the harm
(5) unless D is an aggressor.

REASONABLE FEAR — D must actually and reasonably believe that D is threatening imminent bodily harm (belief need not be correct).
IMMINENT HARM — D must believe harm is imminent  although D may seize last reasonable opportunity to defend himself if V attempts to deprive him of
the capacity for self-defense (as where V attempts to tie D up and torture him later). Note: If threat of harm is past, D has no right of self-defense.
BODILY HARM — "self defense" is not available to prevent or respond to insults regardless of how offensive or vile,  use of force justified only to prevent a
reasonably anticipated battery.

NECESSARY FORCE —  short of deadly force, D may use
that amount of force that is reasonably necessary to
prevent the threatened harm;  if D uses excessive force, he
becomes an aggressor and loses the right of self-defense.

DEADLY FORCE — (1) force intended to cause death or (2) force creating a
substantial likelihood of causing great bodily harm  (including death).
RECIPROCITY — D may only use deadly force to respond to deadly force.

RETREAT RULE (minority)  —
D may not use deadly force if he
actually knew he could have
prevented the harm by retreating.

D must subjectively believe that he
could retreat in complete safety.

D need not retreat from his own
home (many states include any
place of nightly repose and some
include offices and automobile).

AGGRESSOR LIMITATION

AGGRESSOR — D is an aggressor if (1) he strikes the first blow or (2) commits a crime against V.

REGAINING RIGHTS OF SELF-DEFENSE — aggressor regains the right to use force in self-defense if (1)  he
abandons aggression completely and V actually perceives the abandonment,  or (2) V uses excessive force.

DEFENSE AGAINST UNLAWFUL ARREST —  D may use reasonable, non-deadly force to prevent an unlawful arrest or unlawful attachment of her property, but she acts at her own risk; the arrest or
attachment must, in fact, be unlawful or the defense is denied. (Modern view prevents all use of force to resist any arrest, even if unlawful.)

DEFENSE OF OTHERS — in defending another person (V) from imminent injury, D is justified in using only the amount of force which V could use in his own defense; D stands in the shoes of V and if V
was, in fact, the aggressor, the force used by D is not privileged. (MPC and modern trend allow D's conduct to be measured by the reasonable person standard — if D reasonably believed the force used
was justified, the defense is valid.)

DEFENSE OF PROPERTY — modern non-deadly force may be used to prevent theft, destruction or trespass of property. If deadly force was used, look to see whether it could be justified as self defense
(e.g., as where D shot an armed robber) or to prevent a dangerous forcible felony (e.g., as where D shot a burglar intruding into his home).

LAW ENFORCEMENT DEFENSES — police officers and private citizens may use forc
in preventing crimes and effectuating an arrest. Normally, courts are more liberal in
allowing force to prevent a crime (especially a felony) than in an after-the-crime arrest.

POLICE — may use amount of force, including deadly force, which reasonably appears
necessary as long as force is not disproportionate to the offense involved or the resistance
offered (Some states limit use of deadly force to prevent commission of a dangerous forcible
felony or apprehension of a dangerous fleeing felon.)

CITIZEN — may use the same amount of force as police officer except  D acts at his own
risk; defense is denied if D is mistaken about the commission of the crime. (MPC and
modern trend test D's conduct by reasonable person standard.)

NECESSITY — force, including deadly force, is justified to avoid an (1) imminent public or private injury, (2) resulting from natural physical forces, (3) which injury is about to occur through no fault of the
actor and which is (4) of such gravity that (5) according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality (6) the desirability of avoiding the injury clearly outweighs the state's interest in preventing the

proscribed conduct.

THEFT OFFENSES

ACQUISITION BY STEALTH, FORCE, OR THREAT

TRESPASSORY — taking by stealth or force.
TAKING OF POSSESSION (caption) — D must take possession and acquire dominion and control; there can be no larceny if D
already has lawful possession.
CARRYING AWAY (asportation) —  larceny complete when D carries the property away from the point of taking; slight movement
is sufficient.
PERSONAL PROPERTY — D must take tangible personal property at common law, but most states have special statutes for
theft of services and other intangibles.
OF ANOTHER — D must specifically know the property is owned by another; any bona fide claim of right is a complete defense.
Also look for mens rea defenses of mistake or intoxication.
INTENT TO PERMANENTLY DEPRIVE —  D must intend to permanently deprive the owner of the property at the time of the
taking; no larceny if D intends to restore the identical property taken but intent is sufficient if D: (1) intends to pay a cash equiva-
lent at a later time, (2) intends to return only if a reward is paid, or (3) recklessly exposes property to loss.

FROM A PERSON — taking from the "presence" of a person is sufficient if force or threat was needed to sever the property from
the person's control.
FORCE OR THREAT — must precede or accompany the taking. Armed robbery is an aggravated form where D uses a weapon or
an article designed to look like a weapon.

INJURY — includes threats to injure V or his family or to injure V's property.
ACCUSATION — includes threats to charge or prosecute V with a crime (whether or not V actually committed the crime) if used to
cause V to do an act or pay money; claim of right is no defense.
DISGRACE — includes threats to expose V to disgrace or extreme humiliation.
NEED NOT BE IMMEDIATE — unlike robbery, the threat need not relate to an immediate harm.

ACQUISITION BY FRAUD OR TRICK

TITLE — the owner must intend to convey permanent unfettered possession (i.e., title) to D in a sale or trade transaction.
REPRESENTATION — unlike larceny by trick, it is not sufficient that D makes a false promise; there must be misrepresentation of
a present or past fact or there is no crime.
SCIENTER — D must know of the falsity of the representation at the time of acquisition.
RELIANCE — owner must actually rely on D's misrepresentation.

POSSESSION — the owner must intend to convey only temporary possession to D in a rental, loan, or bailment transaction.
REPRESENTATION — includes misrepresentation of past or present facts  and a false promise to return the property.
SCIENTER — D must actually know the representation or promise was false at the time of the taking.
RELIANCE — owner must actually rely on D's misrepresentation or D is only liable for attempt.

LARCENY — (1) trespassory (2) taking and (3) carrying away
of (4) personal property (5) known to be another's with (6) the
intent to permanently deprive.

ROBBERY — (1) larceny (be sure all elements are present)
(2) from a person (3) accomplished by force or putting in fear
(i.e., threat). Includes threat to person, his family, or his
property.

EXTORTION — statutory extension of common law robbery
consisting of (1) the use of malicious threats with the (2)
specific intent to (3) compel a person to either (a) pay
money, or (b) do or refrain from doing any act against his will
(commonly referred to as "blackmail").

OBTAINING PROPERTY BY FALSE PRETENSES —
(1) acquisition of title (not mere possession) of (2) personal
property (3) by means of a representation of fact (not a
promise of future performance) (4) known by D to be false
(5) at the time of acquisition.

LARCENY BY TRICK — (1) taking of possession (not title)
of (2) personal property (3) known to be owned by another
(4) with the intent to permanently deprive (5) where such taking
is accomplished by means of a representation or promise
(6) known by D to be false (7) at the time of the taking.

LARCENY BY CONVERSION — same as larceny by trick except that there is no false representation; the intent to permanently convert the property for D's own exclusive use must be formed  after the
lawful acquisition of possession in a rental, loan, or bailment situation.

EMBEZZLEMENT — a variation of larceny by conversion
developed to deal with (1) the improper use (i.e., conversion)
of (2) property (3) entrusted to D's custody; there is no need
for the intent to permanently deprive and no need for a mis-
representation.

CONVERSION — D need only apply the property to a  personal use to be guilty, regardless of the intent to restore or even the
actual restoration of the property.
PROPERTY — by some statutes includes title to real property.
ENTRUSTMENT — D must have acquired custody of the property as a result of a special fiduciary relationship (e.g., trustee, agent,
employee).

(B) Under Federal Rules of Evidence (F.R.E.)  401, relevant evidence is that which tends
to make the existence of a fact of consequence more (or less) probable than it would other-
wise be. Relevant evidence is generally admissible (F.R.E. 402), but it is inadmissible where
its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues,
misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presenta-
tion of cumulative evidence (F.R.E. 403). The videotape of Dryden showing him unsteady,
abusive, and speaking in a slurred manner is relevant on a charge of driving while intoxicated
and should be admitted. It is not prejudicial nor unfair to Dryden. Answer choice (B) is
correct. Choice (A) is incorrect because the videotape is not a "statement" under  F.R.E.

evidence that is "testimonial" in nature. Choice (D) is a rule of character evidence which is
inapplicable to this question.

(C) The best evidence rule applies only when the proponent is attempting to prove the

event or condition such as a marriage (marriage certificate), payment of money (receipt), or
the utterance of certain words (transcript). Here, the proponent wishing to prove the underly-
ing event may offer testimony as an observer. This does not involve the best evidence rule
because the proponent is not attempting to prove the terms of a writing, but merely is pre-
In this hypo,
senting evidence of an event perceived by a witness with firsthand knowledge. 
O'Toole's testimony is not reliant on the writing or the videotape. He had firsthand knowledge
of Kaufman's confession because he was present and overheard it. By analogy, in  People v.
Swayze,  220 Cal. App. 2d 476, the best evidence rule did not preclude a police officer from
testifying to a statement made by the defendant that also happened to be recorded.  Evidence,
pg. 706.

MBE Exam Tip: This distinction between the best evidence rule and firsthand knowledge
is frequently tested on the MBE. Remember the best evidence rule only applies  when the
proponent is attempting to prove the contents or terms of a writing.

(C) This same issue was tested on a recent MBE. A general rule of evidence requires
that a witness have firsthand knowledge of the matter about which she testifies.  Quite
often it is apparent from the witness' testimony whether she has personal knowledge of the
facts she is recounting. Sometimes, however, an opponent will challenge (and object) to
the accuracy of a witness' firsthand account. In this situation, the role of the judge in
responding to this objection is to admit the testimony if he finds that there is sufficient
evidence for the jury to reasonably conclude that the witness has firsthand knowledge.

(D) Under F.R.E. 104(a), preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a per-
son to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be
determined by the court. Preliminary questions of fact governing the application of an
exclusionary rule normally are determined exclusively by the judge. The judge's decision
is final and is not subject to a contrary determination by the jury. Additionally, the judge
resolves factual questions that determine the applicability of any technical evidentiary
rules. He decides, for example, if a dying declarant had a sense of impending death; if an
entry was made in the regular course of business; or if there was a necessary state of

push.*

excitement to qualify a declaration as an excited utterance. Lilly,  Law of Evidence, p. 459.
Therefore, Choices (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because in each case, the preliminary
factual determination will be made by the judge, not the jury. As a result, by process of
elimination the correct answer is (D).

(A) According to Fed. Rule of Evidence 406, "Evidence of the habit of a person or of the
routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence
of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a
particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice."  Exam Tip: On the
MBE the "key" words denoting habit are "always," "invariably," "customarily" and "habitu-
ally." Conversely, if a person "generally" behaves or "often" acts in a particular situation is
not sufficient to constitute habit.

(C) One of the most important Evidence distinctions tested on the bar exam is statements
made in compromise or settlement discussions (F.R.E. 408) and admissions made in con-
nection with an offer to pay medical or hospital expenses  (F.R.E. 409). Statements made in
compromise negotiations are not admissible. On the other hand, under  F.R.E. 409 we sever
and admit the admission while the offer to pay medical expenses is not admissible. Based on
the given answer choices, it is necessary to assume that Jethro's statement was made in con-
nection with settlement negotiations. Since the facts state that Jack has filed a lawsuit against
Moonglow, there is an actual dispute between the parties. Under the circumstances, Moon-
glow's lawyer is attempting to engage in compromise negotiations.

Statements made during settlement or compromise
discussions are not admissible as against public
policy. Note there must be an actual dispute
before settlement negotiations may take place.

The admission is severed and admitted in evi-
dence. But the offer to pay medical or hospital
expenses is excluded.

7. (C) Of the six Multistate subject areas, the Evidence questions are the "trickiest." Here is
a very subtle distinction that was tested on the MBE last summer. Many students will be
"suckered" into choosing choice (D) thinking that this is a settlement or compromise offer. In
order to exclude statements made in compromise negotiations,  "there must be an actual
dispute or, at least, an apparent difference of view between the parties as to the validity or
amount of a claim." Evidence, pg. 811. In this particular question, the tentmaker is concluding
that no dispute existed at the moment Jethro offered to pay Sonja the $100. On the contrary,
Jethro is making a spontaneous statement immediately following the incident at the petting zoo.

Evidence F.R.E. 409 Variation:

Mario had just purchased a new 1981 Alpha Romeo
Spider convertible from Santa Monica Import Motors.
As Mario was carefully driving his Alpha home, within
the posted speed limit, Amy, aged 11, suddenly darted
into the street in front of his car. Although Mario imme-
diately applied his brakes and swerved to avoid Amy,
the car hit the youngster (fracturing her legs). As Amy
was laying in the street awaiting an ambulance, Mario
rushed over to her and said: "I'm terribly sorry. This is
the first time I ever drove this car. I don't know what
happened, but it must have been my fault. Send me all
your hospital bills. I'll pay for everything."

When Amy was later released from the hospital, her
parents contacted Mario who refused to pay anything.
Mario told Amy's mother... "Since your daughter ran
into the street, it was her fault. I have witnesses who saw
what she did. If I weren't such a nice guy, I'd sue you
for the damage to my Alpha."

1. If Amy's parents, on her behalf, sue Mario in tort,
which of the following is the most accurate state-
ment regarding Mario's post-accident statements?

(A) Mario's statement regarding his operation of
the Alpha as well as his statement concerning
payment of the hospital bills are both admis-
sible on the issue of negligence.

(B) Mario's statement regarding payment of the
hospital bills is admissible, but his statement
concerning his operation of the Alpha is not
admissible.

(C) Mario's statement regarding his operation
of the Alpha is admissible on the issue of
negligence, but his statement concerning
payment of the hospital bills is not admis-
sible in accordance with public policy
considerations.

(D) Neither Mario's statement regarding his oper-
ation of the Alpha nor his statement concern-
ing payment of the hospital bills is admissible
on the issue of negligence.

Answer: (C)

(C) F.R.E. 407 allows evidence of  subsequent remedial measures when offered to show
ownership or control. If the tree was on city property and thus the responsibility of the city, it
is unlikely that Dow would have it cut down. Such evidence is therefore admissible, under
answer choice (C), to show the tree was on his property.

(B) According to F.R.E. 605, a judge presiding at the trial may not testify in that trial
as a witness. No objection need be made in order to preserve the point. Note that choice
(A) is incorrect because Brando made the statement in a public hallway area. If another
individual (other than the judge) had overheard the statement, he or she would be permit-
ted to testify.

(B) With respect to rulings on evidence, F.R.E. 103 provides that a timely objection or
motion to strike should state the specific ground(s) for the objection. Usually, objections
will either go to the "manner and form" of a question or answer or to the "substance", such
as relevancy and hearsay. Here, Choice (B) is better than (A) because  Kennett's answer is
non-responsive in form to the question being asked of the witness. Wawa's attorney is ask-
ing Kennett the date the mushrooms were shipped and the witness is responding that
Chester "volunteered at a homeless shelter." On the other hand, answer (A) goes more to
a "substantive" objection.

(D) The question deals with character evidence in a criminal case. In accordance with
F.R.E. 404(a) (1), an accused may offer evidence of his good character by reputation and
opinion, but not specific acts, to prove his innocence, and the prosecution may rebut the same.
However, the defendant must first "open the door" by presenting such evidence of his good
character before the prosecution is entitled to rebut the good character of the accused. Choice

(D) is correct. Caveat: Students must carefully read the call of the question. In this case,
Loscutoff, the prosecution witness, is being called to testify before the facts tell you that
Wapner, the defendant, has presented any evidence. Therefore, the testimony of Loscutoff,
which might have been proper rebuttal testimony at some later point in the trial, will be
inadmissible at this point.

12. (D) According to F.R.E. 404(b), "Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admis-
sible to prove the character of a person to show that he acted in conformity therewith." In the
present example, Hudson is attempting to introduce evidence of Dr. Iris' prior conduct
(namely, her failure to warn Peltz) as circumstantial evidence to show how Dr. Iris acted on
another occasion. Under F.R.E. 404(b), this type of character evidence is inadmissible. There-
fore, choice (D) is the best answer. Choice (A) is wrong because  routine practice covers the
customary or regular practices of a business organization. A single incident of conduct does
not reflect customary behavior.

RULE 404 — CHARACTER EVIDENCE NOT ADMISSIBLE TO PROVE CONDUCT;
EXCEPTIONS:

(a) Character evidence generally. Evidence of a person's character or a trait of his character is not
admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity therewith on a particular occa-
sion, except:

(1) Character of accused. Evidence of a pertinent trait of his character offered by an accused,

or by the prosecution to rebut the same;

(2) Character of a victim. Evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the victim of the crime
offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, or evidence of a character
trait of peacefulness of the victim offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to rebut
evidence that the victim was the first aggressor;

(3) Character of witness.  Evidence of the character of a witness, as provided in rules 607, 608,

609.

13. (B) Choices (C) and (D) are wrong because  F.R.E. 405(b) provides that "in cases in
which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim
or defense, proof may be made by specific instances of that person's conduct." The "key"
question is whether Jabber's testimony is limited for impeachment or may be admitted sub-
stantively as proof of character. According to McCormick, a person's character may be a
material fact that under the substantive law determines rights and liabilities of the parties. For
example, in an action of defamation for a publication to the effect that plaintiff's character is
bad, the publisher may raise the defense that the statement is true.  Evidence, pg. 551.
Similarly, Lavin is suing the newspaper for defamation based upon an article describing
"Lavin as a bad role model." The testimony by Jabber should be admissible substantively
because it relates to the truth of the assertion, which, in turn, would provide the newspaper
with a valid defense. Choice (B) therefore "trumps" (A). Note, too, that (A) is wrong because
it states that Jabber's testimony is admissible only for purposes of impeachment.

14. (B) A trial for fraud is a criminally-related civil proceeding. As a general rule, character
evidence is not admissible in a civil case unless character is "in issue". According to  F.R.E.
405 character is "in issue" if it is an essential element of a charge, claim or defense. For the
exam purposes, remember that character is generally "in issue" and thus admissible in the
following civil actions: (1) defamation, (2) fraud or deceit, (3) negligent entrustment, and
(4) tortious assault and battery when the defendant claims he acted in self-defense.  In
regard to a fraud or deceit action, the defendant's character for honesty is "in issue".
Therefore, Milligan may introduce evidence to show his character trait for honesty. Choice
(B) is therefore correct. Note that (A) is wrong because in a fraud action, it is the defendant's
character trait for honesty, not truthfulness, that is "in issue".

F.R.E. 405
Methods of Proving Character When Character Is "In Issue"

RULE 405 — METHODS OF PROVING CHARACTER

(a) Reputation or opinion.  In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of a person is
admissible, proof may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an
opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into relevant specific instances of conduct.

(b)

Specific instances of conduct.  In cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is
an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, proof may also be made of specific instances
of his conduct.

15. (B) Impeachment and character evidence are probably the two most confusing and dif-
ficult areas in Evidence. Of the 33 Evidence questions on the MBE, approximately 6 or 7
will deal with impeachment and character evidence. In this regard, you must first deter-
mine if the question deals with the impeachment of a witness or whether a person's char-
acter is in issue. If it is an impeachment question, you must apply and be totally familiar
with Fed. Rules 608 and 609. Conversely, if you are confronted with a character evidence
question, you should apply Fed. Rules 404 and 405. Here, the prosecution is attempting
to impeach the credibility of witness-Reno by extrinsic evidence. According to F.R.E. 608,
"specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or support-
ing the witness' credibility, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence."  Therefore, choice
(B) is correct. Choice (A) is less preferred because even if Reno were questioned about the
matter on cross-examination, proof by extrinsic evidence would nonetheless still be
disallowed.

16. (B) This is an extremely "tricky" Multistate Evidence question dealing with impeach-
ment by bias. Many students will choose the "Pavlov dog" response answer (A) by erro-
neously thinking that the question relates to impeachment by specific instances of conduct
under Fed. Rule 608. When impeaching by evidence of specific instances of conduct (or
prior bad acts), extrinsic evidence is  not permitted. Fed. Rule 608 states that "specific
instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting his cred-
ibility, other than conviction of crime, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence." On the
other hand, extrinsic evidence is permitted to impeach a witness by showing bias.  Lilly
points out that "courts generally permit the impeaching party to prove bias either through
cross-questions or by adducing extrinsic evidence, either from witnesses or documents."
Evidence, pg. 358. Therefore, choice (B) is correct.

(A) Under F.R.E. 609 (a)(2), "For purposes of attacking the credibility of a witness,
evidence that he has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from him or
established by public record during cross-examination but only if the crime (2) involved
dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment." The only way a conviction of
a misdemeanor can be used to impeach a witness under this rule is  if the misdemeanor
involves dishonesty or false statement.  Since battery does not, the prosecution may not
question Wiggins regarding this prior conviction. Choice (A) is thus correct. Note that (B)
is wrong because the "balancing test" under  F.R.E. 609 only applies to convictions more
than 10 years old.

(B) According to F.R.E. 609(2), evidence of conviction of a crime shall not be admissi-
ble if a period of more than 10 years has elapsed except at the discretion of the court. Rather
than exclude all convictions over 10 years old, the court may admit such convictions upon a
determination that the probative value substantially outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice.
Note that choice (A) is wrong because a single conviction that occurred 14 years ago does  not
establish a common scheme or plan.

(A) Under F.R.E. 613 "extrinsic evidence of a prior or inconsistent statement by a witness
is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and
the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate him thereon, or the interests of jus-
tice otherwise require. This provision does not apply to admission of a party-opponent as
defined in Rule 801 (d)(2). Nettie's statement made to Patrolman Paye in the police report will
not be admissible substantively, so choices (B) and (C) are incorrect. As such, choice (A) is
the best answer because Nettie's statement is being admitted as a prior inconsistent statement
for impeachment purposes not as substantive evidence.

20.

(B) A vicarious admission is a statement by an employee or agent, made within the scope
of the employment relationship, that is being offered against the employer. The facts state that
Owens, Aamco's employee, made a statement to the chief inspector for OSHA. That statement
was contained within an OSHA accident report. Since the OSHA accident report was a public
record, the correct answer is (B).

21. (A) In some cases, an out-of-court statement which asks a question (e.g., "What time is
it?") is not hearsay because no assertion of a fact is intended by the declarant. However, if a
question also includes an assertion of a fact which is offered for its truth, then it presents a
hearsay issue. For example, suppose a defendant in custody says to the arresting officer, "Will
I get the death penalty for murdering my wife?" As long as the statement is voluntary and not
the product of custodial interrogation, Defendant's question would be admissible as an admis-
sion. By analogy, Natelson's question to his insurance agent does contain a statement of fact
regarding his driving recklessly. As a result, it qualifies as an admission. Therefore, choice (A)
is correct.

(A) Manley's statement on the morning of the accident would be admissible as an
admission. Admissions are the words or acts of a party-opponent (or his predecessor or
representative) which are offered against him. According to the familiar phrase, "anything
that you say may be used against you." Note that choice (A) is correct because an admis-
sion is not hearsay. Although choice (B) is also arguably correct,  an admission is a
stronger grounds for admissibility than a hearsay exception. On the essays, on the other
hand, you would discuss both the admission and the hearsay exception for the existing
state of mind issue.

(A) Federal Rule 803 (3) provides a hearsay exception, without regard to unavailabil-
ity of the declarant, for a "statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emo-
tion, sensation... (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling)..." Such statements
are admissible substantively to prove the declarant's state of mind when that state of mind
is at issue. Declarant Zooman's statement will be admissible to show his state of mind the
day before he was killed. Choice (A) is correct. Note however that Choice (D) presents the
difficult issue of whether state of mind can be linked with proof of subsequent conduct, i.e.
that Zooman planned to go to Chicago to pay Asher money he owed and that Asher had
threatened the victim's life. According to McCormick, admissibility of declarations of
state of mind to prove subsequent conduct in a homicide case present a more complex
problem. Although Rule 803 (3) provides no basis to restrict admission of threats by
others...and therefore the testimony will be admissible...typical cases hold that the decla-
rations themselves are insufficient to support the finding of subsequent conduct of another
unless admitted in corroboration of other evidence. The court can also restrict admissibil-
ity to the issue of victim's state of mind through the use of a limiting instruction.
McCormick on Evidence, 4th Ed. p. 484-5.

(A) The hearsay rule forbids evidence of out-of-court assertions to prove the truth of the
facts asserted in them. If the statement is not being offered for its truth, it is not hearsay.  A
few of the common types of nonhearsay utterances include: (a) verbal acts; (b) statements
offered to show effect on the hearer or listener; and (c) statements offered as circumstantial
evidence of declarant's state of mind. Here, we have an example of nonhearsay because the
statement ("Watch out buddy you're going to step on that piece of fish") is being offered to
show its effect on Yamato. Namely, he disregarded the warning which is relevant on the issue
of his contributory negligence.

(D) This difficult Evidence question deals with the evidentiary use of a statement
incorporated in an item seized during a warrantless search. Choice (A) is an incorrect rea-
son to admit the statement Nicolette made in her diary. Even though the diary was lawfully
seized under the "plain view" exception to the warrant requirement and would not be sub-
ject to the exclusionary rule, the diary, (i.e., the writing itself) is not what is being offered
into evidence. Rather, the prosecution is offering the testimony of Officer O'Brien  as to
what the declarant, Nicolette, stated in her diary. The decedent's statement is being offered
to prove that Carruth threatened to kill her, and therefore it is hearsay. Since no exceptions
apply, choice (D) is the correct answer. Note that choice (B) is incorrect because Officer
O'Brien did not have firsthand knowledge of the contents of the diary. Simply reading
what someone else wrote and remembering it well enough to testify does not constitute
firsthand knowledge.

Hearsay is defined under F.R.E. 801(c) as "a statement, other than one made by the
declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the
matter asserted." Templer's testimony as to declarant Pignatano's out-of-court reply to the
nurse's question is hearsay since it is being offered for its truth, namely to prove that defen-
dant Doucette's car ran a red light. By process of elimination, choice (D) is correct.
Pignatano's reply is inadmissible as hearsay, since no exceptions apply. First of all, choice (A)
is incorrect because under F.R.E. 803(4) a statement made for purposes of medical diagnosis
or treatment must describe "medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations,
or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reason-
ably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment." However, statements pointing to persons responsi-
ble for the condition are considered irrelevant to medical diagnosis or treatment and do not
fall within the exception. Federal Rules of Evidence Manual  p.830. Pignatano's statement
implicated Doucette and will therefore be inadmissible as a statement relating to the cause of
the accident. Choice (B) is incorrect because under  F.R.E. 803(1), a present sense impression
must describe or explain an event or condition  while the declarant was perceiving the event or
condition or immediately thereafter.  Here Pignatano's statement was made in the emergency
room following  the accident. Choice (C) is incorrect because the presence of a non-essential
third person such as Templer would destroy whatever confidentiality existed between
Pignatano and the nurse, and thus have the effect of making the statement admissible.

27. (D) In this case Doucette is the out-of-court declarant proposing to testify as to the truth
of the matter asserted that she (Doucette) drove through a green light. As in the previous
example, the statement itself is hearsay and will he inadmissible since no exceptions apply.
Choice (D) is therefore correct. Choice (A) is incorrect because Doucette is proposing to
testify in-court as to what she said at another prior time out-of-court. Doucette's prior state-
ment is therefore hearsay, despite the fact that she is both the witness as well as the out-of-
court declarant. By the same reasoning, choice  (B) is incorrect because Doucette is not
testifying as to firsthand knowledge but rather as to an out-of-court statement. Note that
Doucette's testimony is not a prior consistent statement because Pignatano's proposed reply
in the previous question will not be admissible since it is hearsay. Choice (C) is incorrect
because amnesia does not per se render Pignatano incompetent under the federal rules.
Furthermore, had Pignatano's testimony been admissible, Doucette could have contradicted
such testimony. Finally, learn to keep the parties straight no matter how much the examiners
try to trick you—note that it is Doucette attempting to contradict Pignatano, not vice versa as
answer choice (C) suggests.

(C)	
According to the best evidence principle, sometimes referred to as the "original
document" rule, in proving the terms of a writing, where the terms are material, the orig-
inal writing must be produced unless it is shown to be unavailable for some reason other
than the serious fault of the proponent. In the present example, the name on the license
is in issue. It is important to point out that Officer White is proposing to testify that the
name on the license was that of Bryon Dickerson. Here, the contents of the license (which
is the writing relied upon for purposes of the Best Evidence Rule) are in issue. As a result,
choice (C) is correct because the license itself must be produced into evidence as the "best
evidence" of the terms or contents contained therein. Note choice (B) is wrong because
Officer White is, in fact, testifying to the contents of the license. Therefore, the name on
the license is in issue to determine the identity of the driver of the vehicle.

(A)	
If a regularly-kept entry is admissible to show certain facts or events, the  absence of
an entry (that normally would be made if an event occurred) may have probative force to
show that the event did not occur. To illustrate, if the ABC company routinely records ship-
ments of goods that are prepaid, the absence of an entry pertaining to certain goods indicates
that there was no prepayment. Although choice (B) is a true statement, alternative (A) is better
because the "key" issue is whether North was a CIA agent. The fact that  his name does not
appear in the CIA employment record  is dispositive of that issue. On the other hand, choice
(B) simply addresses the fact that Casey reviewed the records. Choice (C) is incorrect because
absence of a record is a hearsay exception.

(B)	
F.R.E. 803(6), commonly known as the "business records exception," excludes from
the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available, the following: "A memorandum,
report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diag-
noses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowl-
edge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular
practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compila-
tion, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, unless the
source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trust-
worthiness. The term 'business' as used in this paragraph includes business, institution, asso-
ciation, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not conducted for
profit." For a business record to be admissible, a foundation must be laid to authenticate the
writing. However, note that the declarant of the entry need not testify. The business record
may be introduced either by the  custodian or a reliable qualified witness with personal
knowledge.  Thus, in United States v. Henneberry, 719 F.2d 711 (4th Cir. 1983), the Court held
the testimony of a warehouse manager sufficient to lay the foundation for the introduction of
bills of lading as business records. Since Madden received the invoice from the shipping clerk
as part of his regular business responsibilities, his authenticating testimony (despite the lack
of firsthand knowledge) is sufficient to allow receipt of the shipping invoice into evidence.
Choice (B) is thus correct.

31.

(B)	
In Dr. Dee's criminal prosecution for income tax evasion, the document offered by
the government will be admissible as an admission by a party-opponent. Choice (B) is cor-
rect because the document has been properly authenticated by other evidence establishing
that it was written in Dr. Dee's handwriting, and the ledger of cash receipts is highly
relevant to the cause of action of income tax evasion. Choice (C) is incorrect because
admissions are defined as nonhearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Choice (D) is
incorrect because the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination only applies to
evidence that is testimonial in nature (i.e. not a ledger). Choice (A) is very close, but not

the best answer. It has not been established in the facts that the document was prepared in
the ordinary course of business or that it was the regular practice of Dr. Dee to keep such
a separate ledger for unreported cash receipts. The government tried to lay the necessary
foundation for the business record by asking Dr. Dee to describe his system of book-
keeping, but he refused to testify. Nevertheless, the ledger will still be admissible as an
admission.

(D) It is imperative that students "focus" their attention on the interrogatory or "call of
the question." This question deals with the admissibility of "Simpson's testimony relating to
what she heard over the police-bank radio." Consequently, choice (A) is wrong because in
order to have firsthand knowledge, the witness must have actually observed the event which
she is testifying to. Simpson is not testifying to what she saw but rather what she heard.
Choice (B) is incorrect because a present sense impression is a statement which describes or
explains an event made while the declarant is observing the event or made immediately
thereafter. Again, Simpson is not testifying to what she observed but rather what she heard.
As a result, Simpson's testimony relating to the dispatcher's statement is inadmissible
hearsay because it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, namely that the
"red sports car was speeding."

(B) Under F.R.E. 104 (a), "Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a
person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall
be determined by the court..." The judge is not bound by the rules of evidence at this point,
except those with respect to privileges. To the extent that these inquiries are factual, the
judge acts as a trier of fact. The judge's decision is final and is not subject to a contrary
determination by the jury. On the other hand, the jury is to determine how much, if any,
probative value or "weight" to accord to the admitted evidence, as well as to decide issues
of credibility, (i.e. whether to believe, wholly or in part, the witness's testimony). The
judge not only decides factual issues, but also determines the applicability of any techni-
cal evidentiary rules. He decides, for example, if a dying declarant had a sense of impend-
ing death; if an entry was made promptly in the regular course of business; if there was the
necessary state of excitement to qualify a declaration as an excited utterance; if a witness
is unavailable; or if an original document is unavailable so as to justify the admission of a
copy under the best evidence rule. Lilly, Law of Evidence, 2d Ed., p. 459. Finally, stu-
dents must note that preliminary questions of fact are ordinarily resolved in both criminal
and civil trials by using a preponderance of the evidence standard. Quinella's testimony as
to Electra's statement will be admissible as a dying declaration if the judge by a prepon-
derance of the evidence determines Electra believed her death was imminent. Choice  (B)
is correct.

34. (A) An excited utterance, under F.R.E. 803(2), is defined as a statement relating to a
startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement
caused by the event or condition. Jay's testimony as to Zack's statement  moments after he
was stabbed will be admissible as an excited utterance. Choice (A) is correct. Choice (B)
is incorrect because a dying declaration under  F.R.E. 804(b), which applies to all civil
actions and criminal homicide proceedings, requires a statement of an  unavailable declar-
ant made while under a belief of impending death, concerning the cause or circumstances
of the impending death. Since Zack was present at trial, there is no unavailability.

35. (A) F.R.E. 803 (1) provides a hearsay exception for "A statement describing or explain-
ing an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition or
immediately thereafter". The central idea is that the statement follows the perception of the
event closely enough in time to render deliberate falsification and memory defects unlikely.
At the time when Heidi, an eyewitness, saw the car leave the scene of the accident she wrote
down the license plate number on a matchbook. This written assertion is an out-of-court state-
ment being offered to prove that the plate number of defendant's vehicle matched the number
written on the matchbook. The matchbook entry will be admissible as a present sense impres-
sion. Choice (A) is the correct answer. Note that one reason why Choice  (B) is incorrect is
because under the hearsay exception for past recollection recorded it is testimony that is being
admitted, not a writing as we have in this question.

(B) This same issue dealing with statements against interest was tested last year on the
MBE. Many students will be steered away from the correct answer because Huggins was
present at trial. With respect to hearsay exceptions under F.R.E. 804, unavailability is
required. In this regard, it is important to point out that  a witness is rendered unavailable
if he or she simply refuses  to testify despite all appropriate judicial pressure to do so. Note
that choice (A) is wrong because Huggins, the declarant, is not the defendant but a witness
in the criminal trial.

(A) Former testimony is defined under F.R.E. 804(b) as "Testimony given as a witness at
another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance
with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testi-
mony is now offered, or in civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an oppor-
tunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination"
...if the declarant is unavailable as a witness. Choice (A) is correct because defendant Stowe,
the party against whom the deposition is being offered, deposed the deceased (i.e., unavail-
able) declarant, Vail. At that time, Stowe had the opportunity to examine Vail, thereby satis-
fying the requirements for admissibility of former testimony. Choice (B) is incorrect because
the "residual" exception does apply. Choice (C) is incorrect because a defendant's right to
confrontation allows an accused in a criminal case the right to effectively confront and cross-
examine those who testify against him at trial.

(C) One of the oldest exceptions to the hearsay rule encompasses  statements concerning
family history,  such as the date and place of births and deaths of members of the family and
facts about marriage, descent, and relationship. Under  F.R.E. 803 (13) "statements of fact
concerning personal or family history contained in family Bibles, genealogies, charts, engrav-
ings on rings, inscriptions on family portraits, engravings on urns, crypts, or tombstones" are
admitted. Note that the photocopy of Gersten's birth certificate would be admissible under
F.R.E. 1003 since a duplicate is admissible to the same extent as the original. Choice  (D) is
incorrect because the affidavit from Geraldo is inadmissible hearsay since it is an out-of-court
statement that is being offered for its truth.

(C) Under the "learned treatise" exception to the hearsay rule, the Federal Rules allow
the use of learned materials in the cross-examination of an expert witness. The rule extends to
published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other
science or art. Note that choice (C) is correct because the exception for learned treatises is not
limited to the context of impeachment but is also admissible as substantive evidence.

(B) According to the "learned treatise" exception to the hearsay rule, virtually all
courts have permitted the use of learned materials in the cross-examination of an expert
witness. F.R.E. 803 (18) provides that "if admitted, the statements may be read into evi-
dence but may not be received as exhibits."  Consequently, choice (B) is correct.

(A) F.R.E. 612 clearly states that "Except as otherwise provided...if a witness uses a writ-
ing to refresh his memory for the purpose of testifying, either (1) while testifying, or (2)
before testifying, if the court in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interest of
justice, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it,

to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate
to the testimony of the witness." Refreshing may be accomplished by handing the writing to
the witness accompanied by a request to the witness to read the writing to himself. Thereupon
counsel retrieves the writing and repeats the question. At this point, the witness testifies from
his own jogged present recollection. In this question, Mr. Bentley's present recollection has
been exhausted since he is unable to remember the name of the fifth person who attended the
meeting to terminate Reed's employment contract. Use of the handwritten notes prepared by
examining counsel in her pretrial interview is a proper attempt to refresh Mr. Bentley's recol-
lection. Choice (A) is correct.

(D) In Taylor's personal injury action against Collins, her witness, Smithfield, is offering
into evidence a computer printout from his sophisticated electronic weathering device mea-
suring wind speed. Regarding this computer printout, students should begin by understanding
that under F.R.E. 1001(3), "If data are stored in a computer or similar device, any printout or
other output readable by sight, is an 'original' ." There is no "best evidence" problem as to the
admissibility of the computer printout. Next, a foundation for the authenticity of the scientific
wind device must be laid. Under the  Daubert v. Merrill Dow standard, scientific evidence is
admissible where the device or principle from which the deduction is made has gained a par-
ticular degree of acceptance in the relevant community. Choice (D) is correct.

(A) According to F.R.E. 902(7), "inscriptions, signs, tags, or labels purporting to
have been affixed in the course of business and indicating ownership, control or design"
are self-authenticating. In this regard, McCormick states that a manufacturer's certificate
affords prima facie authenticity to the contents of the product.  Evidence, pg. 700. Note
that (B) is wrong because the best evidence rule applies only when the proponent is
attempting to prove the contents or terms of a writing. Here, the plaintiff is not trying to
prove the contents of writing (such as the terms of a contract) but rather is introducing the
label as prima facie evidence that Fishbone produced the can of sardines.

(D) By process of elimination, choice (D) is the only possisble correct answer. Under
F.R.E. 901(b)(2), a person's handwriting may be authenticated by "nonexpert opinion as
to the genuineness of the handwriting based on familiarity not acquired for purposes of the
litigation". Choice (A) is therefore a correct statement. Similarly, choices (B) and (C) are
accurate statements under F.R.E. 901 since authentication may be made by "comparison
by the trier of fact or by expert witnesses with specimens which have been authenticated".
As a result, choice (D) is the best answer (and thus a false statement) since the arresting
officer's familiarity with Rosen's handwriting  was acquired for purposes of prosecution.

(B) Here is another example why the Evidence questions are among the "trickiest" on
the exam. By now, you can probably see that the Multistate exam  is not testing rote out-
line memorization,  but rather it "hones in" on very subtle nuances and fineline distinc-
tions. In this regard, students need  to differentiate between inferences and presumptions.
According to Lilly, "when a genuine presumption is accepted as true by the trier of fact, it
gives rise to a mandatory inference, which is properly called a presumed fact." Evidence,
pg. 56. Once the basic facts are believed, the resulting presumed fact must be accepted by
the trier unless it is rebutted by contravening evidence. Consequently,  in criminal cases
presumptions are disfavored and subject to close constitutional scrutiny because it tends
to shift the burden of producing evidence to the accused. On the other hand,  an inference
never has such a compulsory effect. The trier always is at liberty either to accept or
reject an inferred fact. In this regard, Lilly further states that "a presumption creates a
compulsory finding that remains obligatory until the presumed fact is rebutted." However,
this is not true of an inference, which results only in creating a jury question as to whether
the inferred fact exists. As a result, choice (B) "trumps" (A) because an inference is
favored over a presumption in criminal cases

(B) In answering this Evidence question, it is necessary to differentiate between the
marital privilege (which is the A choice) and the spousal privilege (which is the B answer).
The marital privilege protects confidential communications between the spouses made
during the marriage. The spousal privilege, on the other hand, prevents one spouse from
testifying against the other in a criminal case. The spousal privilege or incapacity blocks
adverse testimony based on knowledge gained in any way, at any time, as long as the
accused and the proposed witness are married at the time of trial. As such, the spousal priv-
ilege applies to "pre-marital" acts. Choice (B) is correct because the relevant issue regard-
ing Austin's clothing occurred before the marriage. Also, it is important to note that with
respect to the spousal privilege, it is the witness-spouse who is the holder of the privilege
not the accused.

(B) A client has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from
disclosing a confidential communication made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of
professional legal services to the client. The attorney-client privilege extends to confidential
communications made between the client and the client's lawyer or a "representative of the
lawyer." A "representative of the lawyer" is one employed by the lawyer to assist the lawyer
in the rendition of professional legal services. In this regard, confidential communications
between the defendant and a jury consultant hired by his lawyer would clearly be protected
under the attorney-client privilege.

(C) It is important to point out that the attorney-client privilege  "protects only
the narrow right of a client to communicate confidentially with his lawyer about a
legal problem." Lilly, pg. 395. As a general rule, billing records are not protected because
the privilege applies only to the client's (confidential) statements. Although many courts
will protect a lawyer's statements, they must be made and relate to the
rendition of legal advice. Since the billing information is not a confidential communica-
tion per se, choice (C) is correct.

(D) According to F.R.E. 704, "No expert witness testifying with respect to the mental
state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion or inference as to
whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an ele-
ment of the crime charged or a defense thereto." Such ultimate issues are matters for the
trier of fact alone. Therefore, Agent Boone  may not render an expert opinion as to the
defendant's intent to distribute narcotics.

50. (B) In accord with F.R.E. 701, if the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness'
testimony in the form of opinions or references is limited to those opinions or inferences
which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear under-
standing of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. In this regard, Lilly
points out that there are numerous decisions allowing  lay opinion(s) "concerning vehicle
speed" as well as a person's "intoxication." Lilly, pg. 107.

OVERVIEW: PROPHES

P — Probative Sufficiency R — Reliability 0 — Opinion P — Privilege H — Hearsay E — Examination S — Substitutes for Evidence

PROBATIVE SUFFICIENCY —	
must be sufficiently probative to 	
warrant admission.	

LOGICAL RELEVANCY — 
must have some tendency to	
prove or disprove a fact of	
consequence.	

LEGAL RELEVANCY — may	
not be substantially more	
prejudicial than probative.	

Similar Happenings and Transactions —  proponent must show a  substantial identity of material circumstances.
Absence of Similar Happenings (Negative Evidence) —  proponent must show (1) a substantial identity of material circumstances
and that (2) happening would have been known by witness if it occurred.
Foundation (Authentication and Identification) — proponent must offer sufficient evidence to sustain a finding that the evidence
(e.g., a writing, physical object, or voice) is  what its proponent purports it to be. FRE allows self-authentication in some cases.

Liability Insurance — inadmissible to prove negligence, but may prove disputed ownership or control and bias of witness or poten-
tial juror.
Settlements and Compromises (Including Offers) —  to encourage out-of-court settlements, inadmissible as an admission of fault
or to establish value of claim, but may explain delay or show bias.
Subsequent Remedial Measures — to encourage safety measures, inadmissible to prove negligence, but may prove disputed own-
ership or control and, under modern trend, that there was a defect for strict liability.
Character Evidence — reputation, specific instances of conduct, or personal opinion  bearing on character or propensity is inadmis-
sible to prove conduct consistent therewith except if  habit or, in criminal cases only, if mercy rule or prosecutor's rule applies. May
be used to prove (1) character, if an essential element of the case; (2) relevant knowledge of another's character, or (3) to impeach
a testifying witness (subject to limitations on extrinsic evidence).
Impeachment — witness may be asked questions which tend to discredit (intrinsic impeachment), but  extrinsic evidence of bad
character may be used to impeach only if in the form of conviction or it is relevant to a material matter beyond witness credibility.

RELIABILITY — must	
meet a minimal thresh-   BEST EVIDENCE RULE (ORIGINAL WRITING RULE) —  when the contents of a writing are in issue,  the original (includes reliable photocopy under FRE) must be  produced or
old of trustworthiness.

WITNESS COMPETENCY — FRE abandons mental and moral prerequisites, defects go to weight, common law disqualifies a witness if court finds witness cannot (1)  accurately
recount the facts and give meaningful testimony,  or (2) understand the significance of the obligation to tell the truth.
SCIENTIFIC DEVICES AND TESTS — proponent must establish that (1) device or theory is  recognized and accepted in the relevant scientific community;  (2) the device used was
in proper working order; and (3) device was operated and interpreted by a qualified person.

shown to be unavailable. Contents are in issue if (1) writing has independent legal significance, (2) proponent offers a writing, or (3) witness testimony is dependent on the contents
of writing.
DEADMAN'S ACT — abandoned under FRE and many states; where it applies, it prevents testimony as to a transaction with a now deceased or incompetent party unless the testi-
mony is corroborated by independent evidence.

OPINION	

PRIVILEGE	

LAY OPINION — non-experts may give sensory opinions within common experience so long as there is a sufficient opportunity to perceive; quasi-experts may give moderate expert-type
opinions if sufficient foundation is laid.
EXPERT OPINION — expert opinion may be given if (1) it assists the fact finder (many states require that the opinion be necessary, i.e., relate to matters beyond common understanding),
(2) the witness is qualified as an expert, and (3) the opinion is within the state of the art of the field of expertise. May be based on matters not in evidence and inadmissible matter if of the
type relied on by reasonable experts: expert may be cross-examined regarding contents of authoritative treatise (common law requires reliance).

RELATIONSHIP — communication must be made as part of a statutorily designated relationship, no requirement of fee or acceptance of case if communicator was seeking professional
advice or treatment. Minority view — reasonable belief that relationship exists is sufficient.
COMMUNICATION — except in special circumstances, only verbal communications are protected, not observations or impressions (but separate  spousal privilege prevents testimony as
to any matter, not just revelation of a confidential communication).
CONFIDENTIALITY —  presence of inessential person not otherwise privileged precludes privilege (persons who advance the purpose of the privilege such as doctors or investigators
employed to aid a lawyer are protected by privilege).
HOLDER — only holder may waive privilege, privilege may be asserted by another  on holder's behalf, but holder controls.
WAIVER — holder permanently loses privilege as to communications voluntarily revealed by him or by another if holder fails to object when he had an opportunity to do so.
EXCEPTIONS — privilege not available in suits between persons in the protected relationship; joint clients or where communication was made to advance a crime or fraud.

HEARSAY K	EXEMPTIONS — under the FRE, certain out-of-court statements are not hearsay even when used to prove their truth: (1) admissions, (2) prior I.D. of a testifying witness, (3) prior sworn

EXCLUSIONS — out-of-court assertion admissible for a relevant purpose not dependent on its truth:  (1) state of mind of the declarant or listener (2) prior statement to impeach, or (3)
rehabilitate verbal event.

statements inconsistent with courtroom testimony;  (4) prior consistent statements used to rebut inference of recent fabrication or undue influence.
EXCEPTIONS — Admissions, Declaration against interest, Dying declaration, Excited utterance, Mental state exception. Physical sensation. Business record, Official written statement,
Past recollection recorded, Prior recorded testimony. Sense impressions, Expert exception, Equivalency exception.

EXAMINATION C 

DIRECT EXAMINATION — look out for: (1) leading, (2) narrative, (3) assuming facts, (4) compound, and (5) argumentative.
CROSS-EXAMINATION — must generally be within scope of direct exam; leading questions proper.

SUBSTITUTES	
FOR EVIDENCE	

JUDICIAL NOTICE — no formal proof required for: (1) state and federal laws and regulations; (2) universally known facts, or (3) facts subject to undisputed verification.
PRESUMPTIONS — directs the jury's fact finding process by a special instruction;  FRE and majority — presumption only shifts burden of producing evidence to party opposing presumed
fact; in some states, certain presumptions based on a strong public policy shift burden of persuasion to opponent of presumed fact.

FRE 901(a).

VOICES

LOGICAL RELEVANCY

SIMILAR ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES — may prove dangerousness of a particular condition or knowledge of that condi-
tion by prior or subsequent similar happenings if  a substantial identity of all material circumstances  is shown — burden is
on proponent to lay foundation.
SIMILAR CONTRACTS OR TRANSACTIONS —  to prove or clarify the terms of a transaction or agreement, proponent
may offer evidence of similar but unrelated transactions with opposing party, but not with third parties (some cases have
allowed third party evidence as court has broad discretion).
NEGATIVE EVIDENCE — proponent may prove that other similar happenings did  not occur to prove safety of a particular
condition or no notice if proponent shows (1)  a substantial identity of material circumstances  with respect to evidence,
and (2) that happening would have been observed by witness if it had occurred.
OTHER INFERENCES MAY BE EQUALLY OR MORE PLAUSIBLE —  evidence need only have some tendency to prove
fact sought; close questions tend to be resolved in favor of admission.

Personal Knowledge — testimony from any witness with personal knowledge that the writing was prepared by the per-
son claimed. FRE 901(b)(1).
Identification of Handwriting — non-expert opinion as to genuineness based on familiarity not acquired for purposes of
litigation, FRE 901(b)(2), or comparison with an authenticated exemplar by a qualified expert or the trier of fact.
FRE 901(b)(3).
Circumstantial Evidence —  evidence indicating that information revealed or matters stated in the writing tend to identify
the source as a particular person or firm (sometimes called the "reply message" doctrine), based on notion that the
contents, other than direct statements of self-identification such as signatures or letterheads, if unique, can create a
sufficient inference as to who prepared the writing. Do not confuse with forms of self-authentication. FRE 901(b)(4).
Public Records or Reports — evidence that a purported public record was in the custody of the proper public office.
FRE 901 (b)(7). Includes electronic data.
Ancient Writing — evidence that a writing (1) is in such a condition as to create no suspicion regarding its authenticity,
(2)was in a place where, if authentic, it should likely be,  and (3) it is at least 20 years old. FRE 901(8). Common law
required 30 years. Note, there is also a hearsay exception for properly authenticated ancient writings. FRE 803(16).
Self-Authentication — extrinsic evidence of authenticity is not required with respect to a number of special writings
including (1) public documents if sealed or certified, (2) official publications purportedly issued by public authority,
(3)newspapers and periodicals  indicating publisher, (4) trade inscriptions such as tags, labels, or signs purporting to
indicate origin, ownership, or control, and which were affixed in the course of business, (5)  acknowledged documents,
(6) commercial paper, and (7) documents identified by statutory presumption. FRE 902.

Personal Knowledge — testimony from any witness who heard the statement, saw the speaker, and has personal
knowledge of the identify of the speaker. FRE 901(b)(1).
Identification of Voice — where speaker is unseen or unknown, an opinion identifying a voice based upon hearing the
voice under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker (whether heard first-hand, by recording, or telephone),
or by comparison by an expert or the trier of fact with an authenticated examplar of the voice. FRE 901(b)(3), (4).
Distinctive Characteristics — evidence of unique contents, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics (e.g.,
accent) taken in conjunction with the circumstances. FRE 901(b)(4).
Special Rule for Telephone Conversations —  in addition to the above methods, a person can be identified by evidence
that (1) a telephone call was made to a number assigned to that person by the telephone company, and (2) circum-
stances including self-identification, show the person answering to be the one called. FRE 901(b)(6)(A). In the case of a
business, (1) evidence that a call was made to a number assigned to the business by the telephone company,  and (2)
the conversation related to business reasonably transacted over the telephone.  FRE 901(b)(6)(B).

PHYSICAL OBJECTS — physical objects such as guns, heroin, etc., may be identified as above including: (1)  personal knowledge — testimony
recognizing the object to be what it purports to be; (2) distinctive characteristics or markings; and (3) chain of possession —  testimony accounting
for objects' whereabouts from point of incident at issue until trial (must also show no likelihood of tampering).

LEGAL RELEVANCY

Otherwise relevant evidence is inadmissible if, taken as a whole, its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of (1) unfair prejudice, (2) confu-
sion of the issues, (3) misleading the jury, or by (4) considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. FRE 403. 

DISCRETIONARY EXCLUSION

TYPICAL PROBLEMS – gruesome evidence (e.g., gory color photos, blood-stained objects),  statistical probabilities, prior bad acts used to impeach a criminal defendant-witness  (even if permitted under charac-
ter and impeachment rules).

FACTORS

LIMITING INSTRUCTION – is it likely that cautionary instruction will protect against improper inference?
ALTERNATIVES – are there less offensive ways of proving the same facts available to proponent?
MATERIALITY – is the evidence directed toward a critical central issue or merely toward background or corroborative facts? (The more important the evidence, the more likely it is to be
admitted since probative value is higher.)
NATURE OF RISK – will admission of the evidence create a risk of convicting an innocent person? (Exclusion is most likely upon objection of a criminal defendant.)

MANDATORY EXCLUSION
Special statutory or common law rules specifically prohibiting certain forms of evidence to be used to prove certain facts.

LIABILITY INSURANCE – evidence that a person was or was not insured for liability at the time of an injury is inadmissible for th epurpose of proving that such person acted negligently or wrongfully.  Admissible
to prove other relevant facts: (1)  agency, (2) ownership or control (if disputed), (3) bias or prejudice of a witness (e.g., witness employed by insurance company liable for judgment rendered). FRE 411.  Rationale:
evidence tempts fact finder to improperly consider ability-to-pay and possibly "deep pocket" of insurance company.

SUBSEQUENT REMEDIAL MEASURES – evidence of a remedial measure, taken or authorized by a civil defendant
after the occurrence of an injury, is inadmissible for the purpose of proving negligence or culpable conduct of the
defendant. Admissible to prove other relevant facts: (1) ownership or control (if disputed), (2) feasibility of precaution-
ary measures (if disputed), and (3) impeachment of defendant's testimony. FRE 407.  Rationale: to encourage persons
to make products and premises as safe as they can be made by removing chance that remedial act will be used as an
admission.

ACTUAL OR ATTEMPTED COMPROMISE – evidence respecting an actual settlement of a disputed claim or an
attempt to compromise such claim (including any statement made during compromise negotations) is inadmissible to
prove the validity or value of the claim. Admissible to prove other relevant facts: (1)  bias of a witness, (2) explain delay
(if undue delay is claimed), and (3)  obstruction of justice. FRE 408. Rationale: to encourage out-of-court settlement of
disputes.

REMEDIAL MEASURE – includes repairs, changes in procedure, termination or
additional training of employee, adoption of rule or other improvement tending to
make a product or condition safer.
PRODUCTS LIABILITY ACTION –  recent state cases hold that rule does not bar
use of evidence of subsequent design changes as evidence of "defect' in a prod-
ucts liability case since cause of action does not require showing of negligence or
culpable conduct.

FINAL SETTLEMENT – rule only excludes statements or acts directed at a final
resolution of a dispute; it does not exclude payments of or offers to pay for dam-
ages unless meant as a mutually binding settlement (see below re: medical
expenses).
EXCLUDES EXPLICIT ADMISSIONS – contra to common law, the FRE bars all
statements made during good faith compromise discussions.

PAYMENT OR OFFER TO PAY MEDICAL BILLS –  evidence of the payment or offer to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses resulting from an injury at issue is inadmissible to prove liability for the injury.
FRE 409. Common law has no analog. Note: specific admissions not necessary to the offer to pay  are admissible. Rationale: to encourage Good Samaritan payments.

PLEAS AND OFFERS TO PLEA — evidence of an offer to plead guilty, nob contendere or actual pleas later withdrawn (as well as any statements made in connection therewith) are inadmissible in any civil or
criminal case. Such evidence is admissible to impeach testimony or prove perjury, or if in the form of a  voluntary and reliable statement made on the record in court. FRE 410. Rationale: to advance the policies
of nolo contendere, plea bargaining, and to make meaningful the judicial decision to allow a plea to be withdrawn.

CHARACTER EVIDENCE (see MIG 4) –  evidence of a person's character is inadmissible to prove conduct on a particular occasion except when it is: (1) in the form of habit (invariable repeated behavior), (2)
used to impeach a witness (subject to limitations imposed by impeachment rules), or  (3) reputation or personal opinion offered by a criminal defendant to show innocence, or by the prosecutor to rebut such evi-
dence (i.e., the "Mercy Rule") and (4) specific implicating facts not derived from disposition alone  (e.g., motive, opportunity, intent, knowledge, identity, or plan). Admissible (subject to discretionary exclusion dis-
cussed above) for relevant purposes other than proving conduct: (1) character or reputation as a primary issue,  and (2) knowledge of character or disposition. FRE 404. Rationale: to prevent undue prejudice
caused by a focus on the character of a person rather than the particular facts of the litigation.

EXTRINSIC IMPEACHMENT: COLLATERAL MATTER RULE –  evidence not elicited on
cross-examination from a witness himself is inadmissible to impeach that witness unless the
impeachment goes to a material matter and, in certain cases, the witness has been, or will be
afforded, an opportunity to explain or deny the evidence.  Rationale: credibility with respect to
a nonmaterial fact is collateral; extrinsic evidence only tending discredit on a collateral matter
may confuse the issues, mislead the jury, and consume an undue amount of time.

MATERIALITY – evidence must either tend to discredit (1) the testimony as a whole by showing  bias,
defects in perception or memory, or untrustworthy character  (manifested by a conviction), or (2) testimony
about an outcome-affecting fact as by showing a material inconsistent statement.
CONFRONTATION – in order to make extrinsic impeachment a last resort, proponant normally required to
confront the witness with the evidence  prior to the offer, however, under FRE 613(b), it is sufficient to per-
mit confrontation after the evidence is admitted. No confrontation is required for the use of convictions.
CONTRADICTION – evidence admissible on a substantive issue (i.e., other than impeachment) may be
offered extrinsically regardless of its tendency to discredit a previous witness (this is so even at common
law where a party may not impeach his own witness).
MINORITY RULE – some states (e.g., California) reject Collateral Matter Rule and permit extrinsic evi-
dence on any substantive or credibility issue.

CHARACTER EVIDENCE

GENERAL RULE: Evidence of a Person's Character or Disposition is Inadmissible Proof of the Conduct
of that Person on a Particular Occasion Except as Otherwise Permitted by Law.

ISSUE SPOTTING SEQUENCE: (1) Is the evidence a form of character evidence? (2) Is the evidence admissible to prove factors other than conduct?

(3) If used to prove conduct, is the evidence admissible under a specific exception to the general rule?

(1) FORMS.

(2) NON-CONDUCT USES —  Character
evidence is not excluded by the general
rule if its relevancy is not dependent on
proving specific conduct of the person
characterized.

(3) EXCEPTIONS — In the following
specific situations character evidence
may be used to prove conduct
because of special considerations
which make the evidence more proba-
tive than prejudicial.

REPUTATION — Evidence purporting to state the community reputation of a person (P); witness need not actually know P.

PERSONAL OPINION — Evidence which includes a personal opinion (as opposed to community opinion) of P's character or disposition; witness must actually know P .
OTHER ACTS — Evidence of acts done by P either prior or subsequent to the conduct at issue in the case.

CHARACTER AS AN  ULTIMATE ISSUE —All appropriate forms admissible to prove P's character where it is an essential element of: (1) a  cause of action or claim
(e.g., character of parent in child custody action; mental condition of testator in probate dispute); (2) a  defense (e.g., truth in defamation action; insanity in criminal
case); or (3) the existence or amount of damages  (e.g., reputation before and after alleged injury). FRE 405.
KNOWLEDGE OF CHARACTER — If the use of character evidence is limited to proving that one person knew or should have known of the character of another (P),
e.g., negligent entrustment, self-defense), all appropriate forms are admissible. If used to test the knowledge and qualifications of a reputation witness regarding P,
questions may be asked of witness on cross-examination as to whether he "had heard" of specific acts of P which would bear on reputation — questions must be
asked in good faith; acts may not be too remote to affect P's present reputation; court may exclude if P is a party and the question is more prejudicial than probative.

CHARACTER OF ACCUSED (MERCY RULE) —  An accused may offer either good reputation or personal opinion (but  not specific acts) which tends to prove her
innocence in a criminal case. If accused does offer good character evidence, prosecutor may rebut by evidence of bad character (but only in the form of reputation or
opinion). FRE 404(a)(1). Common law only permits reputation.

VICTIM'S CHARACTER OFFERED BY ACCUSED —  Except in rape cases, an accused may offer evidence of the character of an alleged victim in a criminal case in
the form of reputation, opinion or by specific relevant instances of conduct elicited on cross-examination. If accused does offer, prosecutor may rebut. FRE 404(a)(2).
In rape cases, reputation or opinion evidence of the victim's past sexual behavior is  not admissible but evidence of past sexual behavior (i.e., specific acts) may be
offered if: (1) acts with person other than accused tend to prove that accused was not the source of semen or injury, or (2) past acts with accused tend to show con-
sent. In both cases, accused must make a written motion and offer of proof and court shall conduct an in-chambers hearing to decide whether and to what extent the
past sexual behavior will be admitted. FRE 412.

STRONG CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE: OTHER ACTS —  In a criminal or civil action, any party may prove that a person did a specific act of a particular occasion
by character evidence in the form of specific acts if such evidence establishes: (1)  motive, (2) opportunity, (3) knowledge or intent (including absence of mistake or
accident), (4) preparation or plan, or (5) identity (as with modus operandi). FRE 404(b). Evidence is not dependent on "mere disposition" as it closely and specifically
links the person to the act in question.

HABIT — Evidence of a person's habit (i.e., invariable automatic pattern of behavior) may be used to prove conduct in conformity to the habit. FRE 406. No need for
corroboration. Considered highly probative of conduct (also applies to routine practice of an organization). FIRE 406.

WITNESS' CHARACTER RE:
CREDIBILITY — Character
evidence may be used to
impeach or rehabilitate the
testimony of a witness.
Admissibility depends on form
and whether evidence con-
forms with impeachment rules
(e.g., collateral matter rule).

REPUTATION FOR TRUTH AND VERACITY — Proper to impeach or rehabilitate if witness qualified? no special foundation
required.

PERSONAL OPINION — Permitted if witness qualified; no special foundation. FRE 608(a). Common law does  not permit.

FELONY CONVICTIONS — Name and fact of conviction of any felony permitted even if underlying crime does  not
involve dishonesty or false statement. May be elicited on cross-exam or proved extrinsically, no special founda-
tion. FRE 609.

MISDEMEANOR CONVICTIONS — Name and fact of conviction permitted but only if underlying crime involves
dishonesty or false statement. May be elicited on cross-exam or proved extrinsically, no special foundation. FRE
609. Minority (e.g., California) do not permit at all.

OTHER
ACTS

UNCONVICTED CONDUCT —  Witness may be impeached by direct evidence of specific acts by the witness
(not arrests, indictments, etc.) which bear on truthfulness or honesty,  may be elicited on cross-exam asking if
the witness actually did the act, no extrinsic evidence permitted if witness denies act.  FRE 609. Minority (e.g.,
California) do not permit use of unconvicted conduct.

REVERSED AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONVICTIONS — May not be used but if appeal is still pending, use
permitted.

JUVENILE CONVICTIONS — May only be used to impeach a prosecution witness in a criminal case, not the
defendant or a defense witness.

DISCRETION — Court may always exclude impeaching evidence if it is deemed more prejudicial than probative.
If a party is the witness (especially a criminal accused), court will carefully examine the probative value of convic-
tions and other acts to determine relevancy (i.e., does act relate closely enough to truthfulness or honesty, is it too
remote?). Convictions over 10 years old must be specifically examined for probative value. FIRE 609(b).

MINIMAL RELIABILITY

TESTIMONIAL COMPETENCE 

OATH OF AFFIRMATION — Witness must declare that he will testify truthfully, by oath or affirmation administered in a form calculated to awaken his conscience and impress his mind with the obligation to do so. FRE 603.
At common law, witness must also demonstrate that he understands the obligation to tell the truth.

PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE — A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that he has personal knowledge of the matter. FRE 602.

MENTAL CAPACITY — FRE 601 abandons all common law requirements relating to capacity to perceive and tell the truth. Thus, no witness is incompetent to testify by virtue of age, mental illness (including illness directly
related to knowing and telling the truth), use of drugs or alcohol (even if shortly before testifying) or any other fact — all such facts may be used to impeach the witness and go to weight rather than admissibility. Common law is
contra requiring, on objection, a special judicial finding that the witness has the capacity to accurately observe, remember, and recount the facts.

FINANCIAL INTEREST IN OUTCOME: DEAD MAN'S RULE —  The FRE abandons the common law dead man's rule which disqualifies witnesses who have a financial interest in the outcome of a civil suit (applicable where the
opposing party is incapable of testifying because of death or mental incompetency). Many major states (e.g., New York, Florida) still retain such statutes, which differ substantially in specific provisions.

SPECIAL STATUS	

JUDGE AS A WITNESS — A judge may not testify in any trial in which he is presiding. FRE 605.
JUROR AS A WITNESS — A member of the jury may not testify as a witness in a case in which she is sitting as a juror. FRE 606(a). A juror is also incompetent to testify as to any matter or statement
occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations, nor may she testify as to any matter which influences her vote or any other juror's vote even upon an inquiry into the validity of an indictment or
verdict. Exception: May testify re: extraneous prejudicial information brought to jury's attention or whether there was an improper outside influence. FRE 606(b).
ATTORNEY AS A WITNESS — Although there are major ethical restrictions regarding the testimony of an attorney, her partner or associate in any case in which she is representing a client, an attorney
is not incompetent under the evidence rules.

BEST EVIDENCE RULE (BER): EXCLUSION OF SECONDARY EVIDENCE
In (1) proving the contents of a writing,  (2) the original writing itself (3) must be produced (4) or shown to be unavailable
(5) by the proponent of the secondary evidence (6) unless the writing refers to a collateral issue.

(1) PROVING CONTENTS OF WRITING —
BER only applies when the evidence offered is
intended to prove what the writing says; not
applicable if evidence merely seeks to estab-
lish there was a writing or if the actual precise
content of the writing is irrelevant to its eviden-
tiary value.

CONTENTS
IN ISSUE

Category 1: Writing Has Independent Legal Significance — Rights or obligations at issue arise from, and are directly affected by, the precise
content of the writing. Examples: Actions based on a will, written contract, lease; liability affected by specific written notice or disclaimer; defam-
atory writing, manuscripts and books in copyright actions; recordings of  defamatory statements or extortionate threats  where action is based on
precise words; photos or motion pictures in pornography action.
Category 2: Writing Offered as Evidence — Party puts contents of writing in issue by offering it in evidence even if writing is not of independent
legal significance. Examples: Receipt to prove payment; transcripts or mniutes to prove what was said at prior hearing or meeting; letters,
memos, notes to prove knowledge, intent, motive or attitude of author or recipient;  x-ray to prove injury. (Note: Writing must also be authenticated
and avoid hearsay rule).
Category 3: Testimony Reliant on Writing — Witness puts contents of writing in issue if his testimony is derived from what he saw in a writing,
rather than from personal knowledge of the facts evidenced by the writing (i.e., witness is merely a conduit for the writing itself).  Examples:
testimony based upon a letter, x-ray, tape recording, transcript, receipt, bank or business records.  (Note: Underlying writing is usually hearsay.)

WRITING DEFINED — Includes all forms of tangible writings, sound and electronic recordings of all forms, and photographs of all sorts including pictures, prints,
x-rays, video tapes, and motion pictures. FRE 1001(1)(2).

(2)ORIGINAL — Includes (1) the writing, recording, or photograph itself; (2) any "counterpart" of the original intended to have the same effect as the original (e.g., multiple copies of a contract); (3) any "duplicate original"
produced by the same impression as the original (e.g., carbon copies), or from the same plate or matrix (e.g., printed or mimeographed copies), or by photographic process (includes photocopies, enlargements and miniatures).
FRE 1001(3)(4). Duplicates are treated as original unless there is a  genuine question of authenticity,  or under the circumstances, the court believes it would be unfair not to require the original itself. FRE 1003. Common law
does not treat photocopies as originals unless they were made in the ordinary course of business as a business record.

(3)PRODUCED — Original need not be actually offered in evidence so long as it is produced for examination and inspection.  Example: memo qualifying for past recollection recorded may be read into evidence, but writing itself
cannot be introduced; same for portions of learned treatises used to cross-examine an expert.

(4) UNAVAILABILITY —  The BER is only a
rule of preference; if the original is not avail-
able, secondary evidence may be used.

LOST OR DESTROYED — Sufficient if all originals are lost or destroyed, so long as unavailability does not result from bad faith conduct of proponent. FRE (1004(1).
UNOBTAINABLE — Cannot be obtained by any available judicial process or procedure. FRE 1004(2).
POSSESSION OF OPPONENT —  Party now objecting was put on notice that the contents of a writing would be in issue at the time he had possession of the original
of the writing and said party does not produce the original. FRE 1004(3).
IMPRACTICALITY — If contents of voluminous writings cannot conveniently be examined in court, a chart, summary, or calculation may be presented so long as
originals were reasonably made available for inspection and copying. FRE 1006. Also, certified copies of  public records are admissible because original is
"unavailable." FRE 1005.

(5)BURDEN ON PROPONENT —  Foundational facts relating to admissibility of secondary evidence (e.g., unavailability) are to be decided by the judge. However, if there is a dispute as to (1) whether the asserted writing ever
existed at all; (2) which of several writings is in fact the original; or (3) whether the secondary evidence correctly reflects the contents of the original; the issue is for the jury to decide. FRE 1008. If original is unavailable, any
form of secondary evidence is admissible; there is no hierarchy of secondary evidence. Some states prefer written copies to oral testimony.

(6)COLLATERAL ISSUE EXCEPTION —  BER does not apply where the writing is not closely related to a controlling issue (i.e., de minimus exception). FRE 1004(4).

PERSONAL PERCEPTION — knowledge
required by opinion must be  rationally
derived from personal perception.

NON-EXPERT

SPECIAL NEED — opinion must be
necessary to effective communication of
the perception or specially helpful to a
clear understanding of the facts.

OPINIONS

Adequate Opportunity to Perceive — perception must be sufficient in time and scope to justify conclusion (look out for split sec-
ond judgments and perception — impeding facts).

Exceptions — personal knowledge not required for (1) opinions of sanity by a subscribing witness or (2) opinions about oneself
including property, condition mental state, etc. (see below).

Opinions About Oneself —  relating to one's own mental state (including intent, motive, emotion),  physical or mental condition
(including nature and cause of condition, disease or illness), personal history (including name, age, parentage),  property (includ-
ing ownership and value), and value of services.

Sensory Descriptions — odors and sounds and their sources, colors, temperature, taste.

Measurements — speed, weight, height, distances in general (e.g., "fast," "heavy," "tall," "far,") or specific terms (e.g., mph,
pounds, feet and inches).

Identifications — of property or persons including distinguishing characteristics such as voice, footsteps, age.

Physical Condition of Others —  general perceptions of injury, fatigue, intoxication.

Mental Condition of Others — rationality, normality, competency and sanity, but stronger foundation of knowledge is required and
opinion must avoid legal conclusion.

Meaning of Conduct — "nodding" affirmatively, "indicating" agreement, who "started" or "provoked" a fight. Broad discretion to
exclude opinions of this type.

EXPERT

RANGE OF COMMON EXPERIENCE —  opinion must be about a matter within common experience and within the  scope and range of common experience. Look out for conclusions
re: extreme or refined observations (e.g., 100 mph, 500 yards, 10 tons, explicit diagnoses). If opinion is beyond scope of common experience, must qualify as an expert opinion.

BEYOND COMMON EXPERIENCE — opinion must relate to matter that is sufficiently beyond common experience so that the opinion of an expert would  assist the trier of fact.  This is
especially important when the expert does not have personal knowledge.

QUALIFIED AS AN EXPERT — proponant of expert must persuade the judge that person has special knowledge, skill, experience, training,  or education to qualify him/her as an
expert on the subject to which the opinion relates. Court has broad discretion in this area and each opinion must be measured against the particular qualifications of the witness and
the state of the art of the field to which the opinion relates.

BASIS OF OPINION — expert opinion
may be based on any proper matter
including materials not in evidence,
and assumed facts.

CROSS EXAMINATION OF EXPERT —
expert may be examined as to (1) qualifi-
cations as an expert, (2) subject to which
opinion relates, (3) matter and reasons
upon which opinion is based, and (4)
compensation and any other facts bear-
ing on possible bias. Major prob

Proper Matter — may be based on matters which are not in evidence and which
are themselves inadmissible if of a type reasonably relied on by experts in the
field involved.

If Based on Statement of Another  —
declarant of statement or opinion pro-
viding basis of expert opinion may be
called by adverse party and examined
as if on cross-X.

If Based on Improper Matter —  court
must exclude opinion.

Assumed Facts — may be hypothetical in nature and based on explicitly designated "assumed facts" which have been or will be
supported by sufficient admissible evidence to sustain a finding of their existence.

Basis of Opinion — expert may but, unless otherwise required by the court, need not state the reasons for the opinion on direct
exam. Such reasons may be elicited on cross exam.

Federal Rule — FRE 803(18) provides that expert may be examined re: statements contained in  published treatises, periodicals,
or pamphlets if shown to be  reliable authority by admission of the witness, other expert testimony or judicial notice. Statements so
used are also admissible substantively as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Common Law Rule — expert may not be examined in regard to the content or tenor of a published work  unless (1) the witness
referred to, considered or relied upon such publication in arriving at or forming his opinion, (2) the witness wrote the publication,
or (3) the publication, has been separately admitted in evidence. If use of statements in a publication are permitted under (1),
such statements are not admissible as substantive evidence.

COMMUNICATION PRIVILEGES

ISSUE SPOTTING SEQUENCE: (1) Is there a protected relationship:?  (2) Was there a communication? (3) Was it confidential? (4) Has the holder asserted the privilege? (5) Was there a waiver? (6) Do any
exceptions apply?

INTENT OF COMMUNICATION – existence of
"relationship" determined by the subjective in-
tent of the communicator to derive benefits of
protected relationship.

ACTUAL STATUS OF CONFIDANT –  parties must
actually be capable of entering privileged relation-
ship; if there is a mistake as to the capacity of a
confidant, no privilege (modern view is contra if
belief was reasonable).

Client – must seek professional advice or consultation; no prior relation-
ship, actual or anticipated compensation, or actual acceptance of case
is required. Corporation is a client if communication is made by an offi-
cer or director (i.e., "control group"),  or by an employee at the direction
of a superior.
Patient – must seek diagnosis or treatment; no prior relationship, com-
pensation, or actual treatment required.
Penitent – one who communicates to a clergyperson in accordance
with the rules or practice of a religious denomination.

Attorney – must be licensed to practice law in any state or nation; not
disbarred lawyers and unlicensed law graduates.
Physician – must be licensed medical practitioner  (M.D. or equivalent)
in any state or nation.
Psychotherapist – if not an M.D. (psychiatrists are M.D.'s) must be
licensed under authority of state; some states include marriage coun-
selors, clinical social workers, and psychologists.
Spouse – must be legally married.
Clergy – person must be authorized under rules of the religion to hear
confessions.

<

BOTH WAYS – all confidential communications are protected regardless of which party makes them (e.g., attorney's to
client/client's to attorney).

 GENERATED DURING AND FOR THE RELATIONSHIP – statements, records, and other documents preexisting the relation-
ship as well as communications made incidental to the relationship are not protected even if later transmitted to privileged per-
son, though the "information" may not be elicited from the privileged professional.
MODERN TREND – observations made by a spouse (especially in context of the "marital home") and observations of a med-
ical doctor during physical examination may be protected  if the holder appeared to rely on the sanctity of relationship to permit
the observation.

INESSENTIAL THIRD PERSONS – person is "inessential" unless presence advances the purposes of the relationship (stenog-
raphers, researchers, investigators, interpreters, and experts needed by a lawyer are essential.)
NON-PRIVILEGED PERSON – disclosure in the presence of an inessential person does not defeat the privilege if that person
is separately privileged (e.g., a spouse).
PROTECTS COMMUNICATION, NOT INFORMATION –  even if holder has disclosed the same information in non-privileged
contexts, the specific "communication" of that information made in a privileged relationship  is protected (e.g., lawyer may not be
required to testify even if any other person could be).
EAVESDROPPERS – at common law, eavesdroppers may testify (modern view is contra) but the communication is still privi-
leged with respect to those in the protected relationship.

(1) RELATIONSHIP — privileges are designed to foster socially
important relationships which require mutual trust and confi-
dence; must normally be specified by statute, though FRE
applies "common law" to federal cases and state law where
state law controls controversy.

(2)COMMUNICATION – under common law, only verbal communications
may be privileged; observations and impressions resulting from confiden-
tial protected relationships are not protected.

(3)CONFIDENTIALITY – communication must be the unique product of
the confidential relationship made under circumstances safeguarding the
confidentiality; presence of an inessential or a non-privileged third person
prevents privilege. Confidentiality is presumed; proponent must show no
confidentiality.

(4) HOLDER – the "holder" controls the privilege; it must be asserted (or waived) by him or on his behalf.

ATTORNEY-CLIENT – client is holder; after death, passes to personal representative.
PHYSICIAN OR PSYCHOTHERAPIST-PATIENT –  patient is holder; after death, passes to per-
sonal representative.
HUSBAND-WIFE – both parties are holders (even after marriage is dissolved).
CLERGY-PENITENT –  usually both are holders.
JUDGE MAY ASSERT – in the absence of a holder or authorized representative, the court may,
on its own motion, assert privilege.

(5)WAIVER – privilege is waived if holder (1)  voluntarily reveals a significant part of the communication, or (2) fails to object to disclosure when he had an opportunity and right to do so.

(6)EXCEPTIONS – for public policy reasons, privileges may not be asserted in
certain situations, especially where the lawsuit is between the parties to the
privileged relationship or to joint holders of the same privilege.

ATTORNEY-CLIENT – privilege not applicable (1) in suit between attorney and client, (2) in suit between joint clients,
(3) where communication was designed to advance a crime or fraud, or (4) if the communication relates to the intent of a
now deceased client with respect to the disposition of property.
PHYSICIAN OR PSYCHOTHERAPIST-PATIENT –  privilege not applicable (1) in suit between doctor and patient, (2)
patient has put his mental or physical condition in issue, (3) doctor appointed by court, or (4) in criminal cases (minority
view – e.g., California).
HUSBAND-WIFE – not applicable (1) in suit between holders, or (2) in criminal case based on assault of spouse or child.
CLERGY-PENITENT –  no exceptions; applicable in all actions.

APPROACH TO HEARSAY

ISSUE SPOTTING SEQUENCE: (1) Is there an assertion? (2) Was it made out of court? (3) Who is the declarant? (4) What is asserted? (5) Is the assertion relevant for a non-hearsay use (i.e., a use not depen-
dent on the statement's truth)? (6) If used to prove its truth, is the assertion specifically exempted from the hearsay rule? (7) If neither an exclusion nor an exemption apply, does the assertion qualify for a
hearsay exception?

VERBAL COMMUNICATION —  includes all written and oral assertions, including tape recordings.

(1) ASSERTION

NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION

ASSERTIVE CONDUCT — gesture or act done with the primary intent to assert or communicate infor-
mation or opinion (e.g., lineup I.D., "o.k." sign); usually in response to a question.
NON-ASSERTIVE CONDUCT — under some theories of hearsay  (not the FRE), conduct is treated as
an assertion if the act is used as  circumstantial evidence of the belief of the actor  in order to prove the
truth of the belief — the conduct is used as an implied assertion of belief (e.g., the fact that a ship cap-
tain took his family aboard a ship used to prove the ship was seaworthy).

(2)OUT-OF-COURT — any assertion not made at the present hearing, including assertions made in other courts, assertions made under oath, and all writings.
(3)DECLARANT — person who made the out-of-court assertion; the source of the information (identification of the declarant is critical to analysis of the "assertion" and the sub-
stantive assertion contained therein).

(4)ASSERTION — isolate the statement made by the declarant (as opposed to the "testimony" of the witness reporting the statement) to determine precisely what is being
asserted. Note: If there are two or more out-of-court statements (e.g., a written report of an oral statement), analyze each assertion separately.

(5)RELEVANT NON-HEARSAY USE (HEARSAY EXCLUSIONS)  —
under the definition of hearsay, an out-of-court assertion is hearsay
only if it is offered to prove its truth. If the evidentiary value of a
statement is not dependent on the accuracy of the assertion con-
tained therein, the reliability of the declarant is not critical, and the
need for cross-examination is removed. Out-of-court assertions rel-
evant irrespective of their truth are non-hearsay (i.e., they are
excluded from the hearsay rule).

(6)STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS — FRE 801(d) specifically exempts
from the hearsay definition certain kinds of out-of-court statements
even though they are offered to prove their truth  and otherwise
meet the hearsay definition.

STATE OF MIND — fact that statement was made tends to prove a relevant state of mind of
the declarant or listener irrespective of the truth of the assertion (normally, used to prove
knowledge, intent, attitude, or belief of a party).
IMPEACHMENT OR REHABILITATION —  prior statement of a witness used to impeach or
rehabilitate (prior statement need not be true to show inconsistency nor to rebut charge of
recent fabrication). Note: FRE permits sworn statements made at a hearing or deposition to
be used as substantive evidence.
VERBAL EVENT — statement which has probative significance totally independent of any
communicative content: (1) transactional words (e.g., contract or a will, operative words of a
legal notice, demand, or donative intent, (2) tortious words of defamation, and (3) questions or
commands, etc.

ADMISSIONS (see Hearsay Exception MIG 10) —  though treated as non-hearsay under the
FRE, the nature and scope of "admissions" are analyzed in the more traditional context of
hearsay exceptions. FRE 801(d)(2).
PRIOR IDENTIFICATIONS — if declarant testifies in court with respect to identification of a
person, any prior statement identifying the person made after perceiving him is non-hearsay.
FRE 801(d)(1)(c).
PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS — if declarant testifies and has been impeached by a
claim of recent fabrication or undue influence,  any statement made prior to the alleged time of
fabrication or undue influence is non-hearsay. FRE 801(d)(1)(B).
PRIOR SWORN INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS —  if declarant testifies, any prior sworn state-
ment (subject to penalty of perjury) is non-hearsay if given at trial, hearing, or deposition. FRE
801(d)(1)(A).

(7)ADMISSIBLE HEARSAY (EXCEPTIONS) — if an out-of-court assertion is offered to prove its truth and it is not exempted by the FRE, it is hearsay. Much hearsay, however,
is admitted because of considerations of trustworthiness, necessity, and fairness. The scope and form of admissible hearsay is embodied in the 30 or so  hearsay exceptions
enumerated in FRE 803 and 804. The most important exceptions are analyzed in MIG 10.

THE BIG 10 EXCEPTIONS

A-Admission D-Declaration v. Interest D-Dying Declaration E-Excited Utterance M-Mental State P-Physical State B-Business Record 0-Official Records P-Past Recollection Recorded P-Prior Recorded Testimony

A- ADMISSION — Rationale: gamesmanship and fairness — a party should not be permitted to exclude his own statements because of inability to cross-examine. Treated as non-hearsay  exemption under FRE; a

hearsay exception under common law.

	STATEMENTS OF PARTY-OPPONENT — (1) statement made by a party to a lawsuit (2) offered against him by his opponent. Personal knowledge of declarant not required; need not be against interest

when made; includes pleas of guilty (unless withdrawn); but not convictions. FRE 801(d)(2)(A).

STATEMENT ADOPTED BY PARTY-OPPONENT (TACIT ADMISSION) —
(1) statement of another (2) made to or in the presence of a party  (3) who
by conduct or silence manifests an unequivocal adoption or belief in  the
truth of the statement, and (4)  offered against the party by his opponent.
FRE 801(d)(2)()B).

STATEMENT OF ANOTHER ATTRIBUTED TO PARTY-OPPONENT (VICARIOUS
ADMISSION) — (1) statement made by another (2) attributed to a party and
(3) offered against the party by his opponent.

Must Hear and Be Able To Deny —  party must have heard or read statement, and he must have been reasonably
capable of denying truth of assertion.
Reasonable To Expect Denial —  circumstances must have been such that a reasonable person would have denied
the assertion if it were not true; remember right to silence in custodial situations.

Authorized Statements — (1) a statement made by a person explicitly or implicitly authorized by a party
(2) to speak on the party's behalf (3) offered against the party  by his opponent. Authority to speak is not
necessarily co-extensive with authority to act. FRE 801(d)(2)(C).
Employee Statements — (1) a statement made by a party's employee or agent (2) concerning a matter
within the scope of his agency or employment  (3) made during the course of the relationship  (4) offered
against the party by his opponent. No authority to speak is required; common law has no similar provision.
FRE 801(d)(2)(D).
Statement of Co-Conspirator — (1)  a statement made by a party's co-conspirator  (2) during the conspiracy
and (3) in furtherance of the conspiratorial goal  (4) offered against the party by the prosecutor (5) if the
underlying conspiracy can be established by independent evidence sufficient to persuade the judge  (by pre-
ponderance) that conspiracy exists. FRE 801(d)(2)(E). Common law only requires prima facie case prior to
admission, not preponderance.
Statement of Predecessor in Interest — (1)  statement made by a previous owner of property  (2) during
ownership (3) offered against the owner-party  by his opponent. Common law, not FRE.
Statement of Decedent in a Wrongful Death Action — (1)  statements made by the decedent in a wrongful
death action (2) offered against the party who brings the action. Common law, not FRE.

D- DECLARATION AGAINST INTEREST — (1) statement by an unavailable declarant (2) so far against financial or penal interests (3) when made (4) that a reasonable person would not have made it unless he
believed it to be true. FRE 804(b)(3). Rationale: unavailability indicates necessity, against interest assures trustworthiness. If statement is against penal interest and is offered to exculpate D, "corroborating
circumstances must clearly indicate trustworthiness." Common law limits statements to those against financial interest; a small minority admit statements against social interest as well.

D- DYING DECLARATION — (1) statement by an unavailable declarant (2) made while
the declarant believed his death was imminent (3) concerning the cause or circum-
stances of what he believed to be his impending death which is (4) offered in a
homicide prosecution or any civil case. FRE 804 (b)(2). Rationale: declarant would
not want to die with a lie on his lips.

INADMISSIBLE IN CRIMINAL CASES OTHER THAN HOMICIDE — common law only admits in criminal
homicide cases; FRE extends to civil cases, but not other types of criminal cases.
DECLARANT NEED NOT BE DEAD — (common law is contra).
PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE — statement must relate personal observations not opinion or speculation.

E- EXCITED UTTERANCE — (1) statement relating to a (2) startling
event or condition (3) made while the declarant was under the
stress. FIRE 803(2). Rationale: excitement and stress preclude
fabrication.

M- MENTAL STATE — statements which purport to directly and
explicitly stale or describe declarant's mental or emotional con-
dition. FRE 803(3). Distinguish from statements which are
merely circumstantial evidence of the declarant's state of mind
(i.e., hearsay exclusions).

SPONTANEITY NOT REQUIRED — under strict common law rule, statement must be "spontaneous" (the intervention of a
question such as "What happened?" can defeat exception, and creates opportunity for fabrication), not so in FRE.
TIMING OF STATEMENT — under common law, statement must be made "during or immediately after the exciting event."
Under FRE, substantial time may pass so long as declarant is still under original stress of the event.
DECLARANT — need not be known or identified; availability is of no consequence.

PRESENT MENTAL STATE — statement purporting to reveal any presently held intent, belief, attitude, emotion, or feeling is admis-
sible to prove the true existence of that mental state.  Some states allow statement to prove conduct of person other than declarant,
but FRE comment urges contrary construction.  Rationale: no memory or perception problems.
FORMER MENTAL STATE — statement of memory or belief is not admissible to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it
relates to relevant facts concerning the declarant's will.  Rationale: expediency and necessity.

(MIG 10 con't)

P- PHYSICAL STATE — statements which purport to state
or describe declarant's physical sensations or condition.

B- BUSINESS RECORD — (1)  written statement (2) made in
the regular course of business  (3) at or near the time of
receipt of the information (4) by a person with knowledge
(5) unless the source of the information or circumstances
of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.  FIRE
803(6). Rationale: memory problems are avoided by
requirement of timely recording and trustworthiness is
assured by systematic checking, continuity and business
reliance on the statements.

PRESENT PHYSICAL STATE — statement purporting to describe any present physical sensation or condition is admissible to prove
the existence of that physical state.  Includes statements of present pain made to any person. FIRE 803(3).  Rationale: no memory or
perception problems: tends to be necessary.
FORMER PHYSICAL STATE —  (1) statement purporting to describe a medical history including  past pain, symptom or sensation, or
the inception or general character of the external source  of the physical condition is admissible if: (2)it was made for purposes of med-
ical diagnosis or treatment, and (3) it is reasonably pertinent to the diagnosis or treatment.  FIRE 803(4). Rationale: no perception prob-
lems, desire for effective diagnosis or treatment tends to guarantee sincerity and trustworthiness.

FOUNDATION — foundation may be established by the custodian of the record or any person who can identify the record and tes-
tify as to mode of preparation; the declarant need not testify.
DATA COMPILATION — business records may be in the form of electric data storage tapes and the like.
OPINIONS OR DIAGNOSIS —  statement may contain an  opinion or diagnosis. Common law is generally contra.
KNOWLEDGE — declarant must have personal knowledge or information recorded  or the record must be made from information
transmitted by one with knowledge.
BUSINESS — "business" includes any institution (including the government), association, profession or occupation.
REGULAR COURSE OF BUSINESS — many cases exclude records made for purposes of litigation (even if made by an investiga-
tor in the regular course of his duties); FIRE has no absolute rule, but authorizes the court to exclude records where there is a man-
ifest lack of trustworthiness.
ABSENCE OF ENTRY — (1) evidence that a matter is not included in a business record is (2)  admissible to prove the non-occur-
rence or non-existence of the matter if the matter was of a kind that was regularly reported unless the sources of information or
other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.  FIRE 803(7).
COMMERCIAL PUBLICATIONS —  (1) statement contained in market quotations, tabulations, lists, directories, or other published
compilations (2) generally used and relied upon (3) by the public or persons in particular occupations. FRE 803(17).

0- OFFICIAL WRITTEN STATEMENTS (Public Records) — Rationale: special trustworthiness is derived from fact that statement was made by or to a public employee with duty to accurately record and no

apparent motive to falsify: necessity results from likelihood that declarant will have no independent memory of contents. "Record" includes reports, statements, or data compilations (including electronic data)
in any form.

	RECORD OF PUBLIC ACTIVITY — (1) written statement (2) of a public employee or agency (3) concerning the activities of the public office or agency. FRE 803(8)(A).

	RECORD OF OBSERVATION —  (1) written statement (2) of a public employee or agency (3) concerning observations made (4) while carrying out a  duty imposed by law  (5) as to matters which there was

a duty to report (6) except that in criminal cases, records of observations made by law officers are not admissible. FIRE 803(8)(B).

	REPORT OF FINDINGS — (1) written statement (2) of a public officer or agency of factual findings or conclusions (3) resulting from an investigation or inquiry within the employee's or agency's legal duties

(4) unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate a  lack of trustworthiness  (5) except that such reports are not admissible against a criminal defendant. FIRE 803(8)(C).

	ABSENCE OF RECORD OR ENTRY — (1) evidence that a matter is not included in a public record is  (2) admissible to prove the non-occurrence or non-existence of a matter of which record is regularly

made and preserved (3) if a certification is offered, or if testimony is produced to show that a diligent search failed to disclose the record or entry.  FRE 803(10).

	RECORDS OF VITAL STATISTICS — (1) written statements (2) of births, fetal deaths, deaths or marriages  if (3) the report was made to a public official (4) pursuant to requirements of law.  FRE 803(9).

	CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE, BAPTISM AND SIMILAR — (1) written certificate (2) issued by a clergyman, public official or other person  (3) authorized by law or the practices of a religion to perform a

marriage or religious ceremony  (4) indicating that such ceremony was performed  (5) if the certificate was issued at the time of the act or within a reasonable time thereafter. FIRE 803(12).

	RECORDS OF DOCUMENTS AFFECTING PROPERTY —  (1) record of public office (2) relating to the existence, content, execution or delivery of a document  (3) which affects an interest in property (not

just land) if (4) such record is  kept pursuant to statutory authority.  FRE 803(14). May prove content of document as well as fact of execution or delivery.

P- PAST RECOLLECTION RECORDED — (1) statement contained in a memorandum or
record (2) made by one with  personal knowledge (3) recording facts perceived by him
while the matter was still fresh in the declarant's mind  provided that (4) the declarant has
first exhausted his present recollection, (5) testified that he knows the  statement truly
reflected his knowledge at the time and (6) the statement is read into evidence only. FRE
803(5). Rationale: memory problems avoided by requirement of timely record, necessity
results from exhausted memory and trustworthiness somewhat safeguarded by opportu-
nity to cross-examine declarant.

P- PRIOR TESTIMONY —  (1) statement made in the form of testimony (2) by an unavailable
person (3) given at another hearing or in a deposition  (4) if the party against whom the
testimony is now offered (or his predecessor in interest) (5) had an opportunity and
(6) similar motive to develop the testimony on direct or cross-examination. FRE
804(b)(1). Rationale: necessity is a result of unavailability and trustworthiness is sup-
ported by prior opportunity to develop and examine testimony.

DECLARANT MUST TESTIFY — person who wrote memo must testify as a witness to lay necessary
foundation re: exhausted present memory and accuracy of memo.
PRESENT MEMORY EXHAUSTED —  court must find that declarant-witness has insufficient recollection to
enable full and accurate testimony on the fact(s) recorded.
NOT ADMISSIBLE AS EXHIBIT — writing itself not admissible unless offered by the adverse party.
RELATED ISSUES — distinguish from (1) present memory refreshed where memo actually jogs recollec-
tion and is not used as substantive evidence; (2) business record where memo made in ordinary course
of business; (3) look out for multiple hearsay — look to reliability of the ultimate source of information.

TESTIMONY — must be under oath or affirmation, but need not be recorded in verbatim transcript (even if
it is, the transcript is not required).
UNAVAILABILITY — in criminal cases, prosecutor must show every reasonable and diligent effort to pro-
duce declarant.
SIMILAR ISSUES — issues need not be identical (common law was contra) and testimony may be given
in unrelated proceeding if the present opponent was involved in suit and had opportunity and incentive to
develop testimony.
SIMILAR PARTIES — parties need not be identical (common law contra); person offering testimony need
not have been involved in prior proceeding; in civil cases, party must accept testimony previously offered
by or against predecessor in interest.

EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES

OBJECTIONS TO
FORM

NARRATIVE — Question too broad and general; testimony will be less rapid, distinct or effective than is reasonably possible and tends to include irrelevant and
other inadmissible responses.

LEADING — Question on direct exam suggests the desired response by its form, substance or tone. Leading questions  are allowed: (1) on cross-exam; (2) as
to undisputed preliminary facts;  (3) in examining witnesses with  comprehensive problems;  (4) in examining hostile witnesses on direct; (5) in examining experts;
(6) when used to refresh recollection.

ARGUMENTATIVE — Question not asked for purpose of eliciting new information but for rhetorical or argumentative effect.

ASSUMING FACTS NOT IN EVIDENCE — Question contains an assumption of a fact that is not supported by any evidence in the record (e.g., "Are you still
beating your dog?").

COMPOUND — Question embodies at least two separate aspects which make the answer unclear or ambiguous. Look for questions containing "or" as well as
separate questions attached by "and" (e.g., "Did you see  or hear him come home?" "Did you see and hear come home?").

AMBIGUOUS OR UNINTELLIGIBLE — Question that is unclear as to meaning or that may not be easily understood by the witness or invites an answer that
may not be easily understood in light of the question.

SPECULATION — Question asks witness to speculate or conjecture (aspect of opinion testimony). Look out for "Is it possible" questions. Witness need not be
certain but must be able to answer with a reasonable degree of conviction.

ASKED AND ANSWERED — Question previously answered adequately resulting in unconstructive repetition and cumulative evidence — broad leeway allowed
on cross-exam.

MISSTATES EVIDENCE — Question contains preface which misstates, characterizes or misconstrues evidence or testimony.

OPPRESSIVE AND HARASSING —  Question or conduct which will cause witness undue embarrassment or emotional stress.

NON-RESPONSIVE — Answer is not responsive to Question; either party may have answer stricken. Court has discretion to not strike unresponsive answers
and volunteered testimony if it is otherwise relevant and admissible, and if elicited by a proper question.

(A)	
The doctrine of standing requires that a litigant have a concrete, personal stake in
the outcome. The generalized interest of a citizen in requiring his or her government act
constitutionally has never been deemed to be a sufficient basis for conferring standing.
Direct, individuated harm—different from the citizenry at large—is required. The case of
Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,  504 U.S. 555 (1992) held there was no standing because of
an inadequate showing of a sufficient liklihood that plaintiffs would be injured in the future
by destruction of endangered species abroad. The so-called "injury in fact" standard was
mandated by the case and controversy requirement of Article III. As a result, it is beyond
the power of Congress to confer standing by statute upon a particular class of persons who
would not otherwise satisfy the Article III requirement. Choice (A) is thus correct and the
suit should be dismissed. In brief, Congress does not have the authority to simply expand
federal court jurisdiction and grant standing to "anyone who wishes challenge" the drug
enforcement statute. As a private citizen, Wilson would be required to show a direct and
personal injury by application of the statute.

(C)	
Whether a party has "alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy
as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentations of the issues" is "the
gist of the question of federal standing."  Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962). Under the con-
stitutional standard imposed by the "case and controversy" requirement of Article  III, per-
sonal standing requires a minimum concrete "personal stake" in the outcome by a two-fold
showing of, first, "distinct and palpable injury" and, second, a "fairly traceable" causal con-
nection between the claimed injury and the challenged conduct. Nowak,  Constitutional
Law, p. 74. Choice (C) is correct because a boat manufacturer who is  currently selling to
Newcastle retailers most likely has standing to challenge the Newcastle Boating Act. Since
this manufacturer is presently selling to Newcastle retailers, the likelihood of his incurring
reimbursement costs for the boat inspections is more distinct and actual than that of any
plaintiff in the other given answer choices. Furthermore, an adjudication in favor of the boat
manufacturer will redress the claimed injury, i.e., establishing causal connection. The
interests represented by the Newcastle residents in choices (A) and (B) are  in futuro and
would fail for lack of ripeness. Choice (D) is incorrect because such a basis for a state tax-
payer challenge would fail to establish a direct and measurable economic injury.

(D)	
The United States, as a sovereign, is immune from being sued unless it has waived its
sovereign immunity by statute. United States v. Thompson,  98 U.S. 456, 489 (1878). Consent
to sue the federal government must be clearly given, expressly and implicitly. See, generally,
Jackson, V., Suing the Federal Government: Sovereignty, Immunity, and Judicial
Independence, 35 Geo. Wash. Intl L. Rev 521 (2003). Choice (A) is incorrect. Waiver by the
United States of its sovereign immunity is not a nonjusticiable issue and is a proper subject
for judicial review. Choice (B) is wrong. Congress, by statute, can authorize nonresident aliens
to sue in federal court. Choice (C) is incorrect. In a wrongful death action, relatives of the
deceased have sufficient standing (injury) to bring suit under Article III.

(A)	
Cody's suit challenging the constitutionality of the Santa Ana city ordinance prohibit-
ing male teenagers from entering the discotheque unless accompanied by a female raises an
issue of discrimination based on gender. Under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, the
"case or controversy" requirement establishes the concept that federal court jurisdiction will not
be exercised absent an actual and definite dispute between parties having adverse legal inter-
ests. Cody's suit will satisfy this requirement because the unequal treatment by which the ordi-
nance deals with teenage males versus females might adversely affect the legal interests of all
teenage males who wish to enter the discotheque, thereby constituting an actual and definite
dispute. Choice (A) is therefore correct since the federal court should hear the case. Choice  (B)
is incorrect because the case is not moot. A case is moot unless an actual controversy exists
at all stages of review. Since a denial of admission could similarly occur to other teenage males
trying to enter the discotheque without a female, Cody's lawsuit is not moot.

(B)	
Under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court is given appel-
late jurisdiction "both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such
Regulations as the Congress shall make." The case of Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. 506
(1868) upheld Congress' power to regulate broadly the scope of  appellate jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court, subject to certain theoretical limitations: Congress may not deny the
Supreme Court its essential constitutional role by taking from it all avenues of review,
although certain classes of cases may be restricted, so long as  some lower federal court
has jurisdiction and due process protection is afforded. Also under Article III, Congress
has plenary power to establish and terminate lower federal courts, and to confer and
remove their scope of jurisdiction. Choice (B) correctly states the applicable rule of law
by which Congress may establish Supreme Court appellate review of specified lower state
court decisions.

(C)	
Under Article III, Section 1, the judicial power of the United States is vested in one
Supreme Court and "in such inferior Courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and
establish." Congress has exclusive control over the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts
inasmuch as these courts do not exist until Congress creates them. Since Congress can confer
and remove jurisdiction, it may define what types of cases may be heard by the (federal) dis-
trict courts and the courts of appeal. Therefore, cases which fall within the general federal
judicial power (i.e., diversity of citizenship cases) may constitutionally be eliminated com-
pletely by Congress. Choice (C) is correct. The leading case by the Supreme Court on elimi-
nating diversity jurisdiction from federal district courts is Shelden v. Sill,  49 U.S. 441 (1850)
(upholding Judiciary Act of 1789 which prohibited diversity jurisdiction from being created
by the assignment of a debt). In short, because Congress has discretion to create lower (infe-
rior) federal courts, Congress also has the power to determine their jurisdiction.

(B)	
Students should be advised that the President can only grant pardons or reprieves for
federal offenses. The President is not empowered to grant pardons for state offenses. The
governor has pardoning power over persons convicted of state crimes. Since the Algerian pris-
oners were subject to a California state criminal prosecution (for kidnapping), choice (B) is
correct.

(D)	
Under the Appointment Clause of Article II, the President alone may nominate "offi-
cers of the United States" – called  "principal officers" by the Supreme Court, which includes
Heads of Departments i.e., members of President's cabinet (e.g., Attorney General),
Ambassadors, and Supreme Court Justices. Other federal officials subject to appointment are
called "inferior officers." which includes deputy cabinet members, members of a federal
agency, e.g. Food and Drug Administration, F.A.A., Federal Elections Committee, etc. Under
the Appointment Clause, Congress (not the President) decides who appoints  "inferior offi-
cers:" (1) The President, (2) Heads of Departments, (3) Courts of Law, or any combination
thereof. In this question, Congress created a new federal agency to enforce the "Clean Air and
Water Protection Act." The five members of the committee created by the Act are "inferior
officers" under the Appointment Clause. It is  Congress who decides who appoints these mem-
bers. Under the statute in our question, the President is authorized to appoint three of the five
members, and the "top official" in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—
the "Head of a Department" was authorized to appoint two members of the agency. This
scheme is constitutional under the Appointment Clause. Thus, Choice (D) is correct. See,
Buckley v. Vadeo,  424 U.S. 1 (1976) (federal law authorizing Speaker of the House and pres-
ident pro tempore of the Senate to appoint members of the Federal Election Commission, was
held to be a violation of the Appointment Clause).

(C) A treaty or act of Congress will supersede and take precedence over an inconsis-
tent executive agreement or order. This question is a bit "tricky" because the facts state that
the earlier act of Congress "neither authorizes nor prohibits the president's actions." As a
consequence, many students may be "tempted" to choose choice (A). However,
Restatement of Foreign Relations Law, 2d,  takes the position that an executive agree-
ment is effective and binding as long as it "does not supersede inconsistent provisions of
earlier acts of Congress."  Nowak, Constitutional Law,  pg. 227. Here, the federal law cur-
rently in effect designates ten national holidays. By increasing the number of national hol-
idays for executive employees, the president's action is clearly in contravention with the
earlier act of Congress. Choice (C) is correct because it provides the best rationale why the
executive order should be invalid.

(B) This Constitutional Law question involves a difficult interplay between justifiabil-
ity and executive agreements. As a general rule, matters involving foreign affairs are non-
justiciable and immune from judicial review. The decided cases relate to foreign policy or
international affairs (e.g., Cambodian bombing and legality of Vietnam War nonjusticia-
ble). However, executive agreements relating to economic matters are generally subject to
judicial review. For example, in United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc.,  a corporation had
standing to challenge an executive agreement between Canada and United States regulat-
ing potato exports by Canada. By the same token, private litigants were given standing to
challenge President Carter's executive order freezing Iranian assets. Therefore, choice (B)
"trumps" as being the best answer. Note that choice (C) is wrong because executive agree-
ments are generally valid and not subject to congressional approval. Choice (D) is wrong
because the Contract Clause restricts the power of state or local governments to modify the
obligations of parties to a private contract. However,  the federal government is not sub-
ject to the Contract Clause.  Nowak, Constitutional Law, pg. 416.

(A) The President has no independent power to establish the percentage of water con-
servation but Congress may delegate its power to do so to the President. First, the President
has no authority to set regulatory standards for water usage. This is a legislative action.
Congress has the power to legislate water usage under its power to regulate interstate com-
merce. Second, Congress may delegate certain of its enumerated powers to the President,
the courts, or other administrative agencies. When Congress attempts to delegate power,
two general requirements must be met: (1) the power must be  one which Congress may
delegate.  Certain powers are constitutionally stated such that a delegation would be invalid
(i.e., the power to declare war, to ratify treaties, to try cases of impeachment, etc.); and (2)
the delegation must contain at least some general guidelines  such that a court could deter-
mine whether the delegatee had exceeded the authority granted by Congress. Here,
Congress could most certainly delegate the power to set the percentage of energy con-
sumption. This would be a limited delegation of a small portion of Congress' power to reg-
ulate interstate commerce. Moreover, the President's determination of the proper
percentage was subject to "specific standards" and "detailed procedures" which would
ensure that a court could determine if the President overstepped the authority granted by
Congress.

12.

(C) Sometimes on the Multistate Exam students are tested on hornbook footnotes. On a
recent MBE, students were tested on whether the ruling of an administrative agency "pre-
empts" a conflicting state law.  This obscure rule of law is not covered by general bar review
outlines. Rather Nowak in his hornbook on Constitutional Law covers this area in the footnote
section dealing with federal preemption. As a general rule, the actions of federal agencies may
preempt state law. According to Nowak, "when Congress gives an administrative agency dis-
cretion to regulate a field of commercial activity, the agency's decision to preempt state reg-
ulations should be upheld."  Constitutional Law, footnote 5, pg. 322.

The Supremacy Clause provides that when Congress intends to occupy a given
field (preemption) or where an actual, direct conflict between a federal law and a state law
exists, the state law will generally be invalidated. However, if the subject matter has tradi-
tionally been left to the states, it is less likely to be found to be the subject of federal pre-
emption. This is especially true in cases  involving health and safety regulations.  In the
case of Hillsborough County, Florida v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,  471 U.S.
707 (1985) the FDA established standards for the collection of blood plasma. Hillsborough
enacted an ordinance imposing  additional regulations on blood plasma collection. The
U.S. Supreme Court held that there was no preemption because the regulation of health
and safety matters is primarily and historically a matter of local concern.

(D)	
The 1 1 th Amendment provides: "The judicial power of the United States shall not
be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one
of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign
state." Thus, the 1 1 th Amendment on its face bars a lawsuit in federal court brought by a
citizen of one state against another state. In addition, the Supreme Court has ruled that a
citizen of a state may not sue his own state in a federal court. Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S.
1 (1890). Choice (A) is wrong. Lawsuits filed in federal court against state officials are not
barred by the 11th Amendment, as long as the plaintiff is not seeking damages to be paid
by the state itself. See Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). Edleman v. Jordan, 415 U.S.
651 (1974) (11th Amendment prevents federal court from awarding retroactive relief—
damages to compensate past injuries—when those damages will be paid by the state trea-
sury, even if the state officer is named as the defendant, rather than the state itself). Choice
(B) is incorrect because the suit here is filed in a state court, not a federal court. Choice
(C) is incorrect, because suits filed in federal court against the political subdivision of a
state are not barred by the 11th Amendment (e.g. cities, counties, etc.). See  Mt. Healthy
City School District Board of Education v. Dole,  429 U.S. 274 (1977). Therefore, Choice
(D) is correct. The 1 1 th Amendment bars suit against states and arms of the state, includ-
ing state agencies. See Regents of University of California v Doe,  519 U.S. 425 (1997).

15. (A)	

This question deals with the area of intergovernmental immunity. While the
Supremacy Clause prohibits state or local governments from directly regulating or taxing
the federal government without its consent, the tax here is not upon the federal government
but upon a private concessionaire using federal property. Such "property interest taxes" tax
the user's right to the use and enjoyment of federal property, although the property itself
is exempt from the state taxation. So long as the property interest tax is nondiscriminatory,
it is not constitutionally prohibited. Note that if the State of Cumberland attempted to tax
the federal government directly (e.g., a state tax on rental receipts, including the federal
government's receipts from its concession lease to Reeves), (D) would be the best choice.

Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power
(A)	
to dispose of and make "all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other
Property of the United States...." Use of this broad federal property power is subject to con-
gressional discretion and not subject to state regulation. Regarding United States territories,
"Congress has the entire dominion and sovereignty, national and local, Federal and State, and
has full legislative power over all subjects upon which the legislature of the State might
legislate with the State, and may, at its discretion entrust that power to the legislative assem-
bly of a Territory." See Nowak, Constitutional Law, pg. 124. The federal property power is
plenary and has been applied to the following areas: the establishment of legislative courts
with powers not derived from Article III; and regulation of (1) wild animals on federal lands,
(2) federal buildings and enclaves, (3) military ships and airplanes and (4) Indian reservations.
In light of the federal property power, Congress may validly convey the 1,000 acres of federal
land to the Poco Indians. Choice (A) is correct.

Under Article I, §8 of the Constitution, Congress is granted the exclusive power to
(C)	
coin money. Any attempt by the state or local governments to create a substitute or competi-
tive currency will be struck down as violative of the exclusive federal power. Here, the
Midwest Bucks are being used as a substitute for U.S. currency in the state of Midwest. Thus,
the state is substituting its own currency for legal U.S. tender in violation of the exclusive fed-
eral power to coin money. (A)  is not the best choice. There is no apparent burden on interstate
commerce under these facts. In contrast, it appears that commerce has been facilitated by the
use of a secondary form of currency.

Any state or local law that either directly or indirectly conflicts with federal law will
(A)	
be struck down as violative of the Supremacy Clause of Article VI. Here, the federal govern-
ment has virtually unlimited power to regulate immigration policy and the conduct of U.S.
foreign affairs with other nations. A state government regulation seeking to retaliate for
hostage taking of Americans by penalizing the citizens of nations where hostages have been
held could seriously undermine the efforts of the federal government to negotiate with these
nations. Even when the federal government has not directly prohibited the states from acting
in a particular area of regulation, state laws which act as an "obstacle to the accomplishment
and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress," have been struck down.  Hines
v. Davidowitz  (1941). Choice (B) is not the best choice. The constitutional prohibition against
ex post facto laws only prohibits  criminal penalties that have been imposed retroactively.
Here, denial of admission to a state university would probably not be considered a criminal
penalty because no fine or incarceration is imposed. Choice (C) is not the best choice. The
right to attend a state university should not be considered a fundamental right worthy of sub-
stantive due process protection. The Supreme Court has held in an analogous situation that
public education is not a fundamental right  (San Antonio v Rodriguez  (1973)). In addition,
denial of admission to the state university would be unlikely to warrant procedural due
process protection either as there is nothing for a hearing to resolve. Choice  (D) is not the best
choice because (1) attending a state university is not a "privilege or immunity" of the
Fourteenth Amendment and (2) only U.S. citizens are protected under this clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Students should recognize that the Privileges and Immunities Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment is extremely limited. Only one Supreme Court decision has
ever struck down a law as violative of this clause and even that case was overruled five years
later.

Under Article I, Section 8, Congress has plenary power to tax and spend for the
general welfare. In United States v. Butler,  297 U.S. 1 (1936), the Court held that Congress
is not limited to spending only to achieve the specific powers granted in Article I of the
Constitution. Rather, Congress may spend in any way it believes would serve the general
welfare, so long as it does not violate another constitutional provision. The $50 million
farm aid bill to subsidize Florida citrus growers for economic loss is clearly constitutional
under Congress' spending power. Note that choice (B) is preferred over (A) because the
latter incorrectly states that Congress' spending power is not subject to judicial review.
Clearly, there have been many cases where Congress' spending power has been challenged
and subject to judicial review.

20.

(A)	
Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress plenary power to reg-
ulate interstate commerce and commerce with foreign nations. Since Congress does have
the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, the legislation is constitutional. As
such, the ODTC would have the authority to regulate the sale of Dr. Gates' encryption soft-
ware program to a foreign company.

Con Law "Commerce Clause" Variations:

Variation 1 is based on the following fact situation.

Variation 2 is based on the following fact situation.

Quicksilver Messenger Service conducts a courier
delivery service in the state of Lansing. Quicksilver
delivers documents and packages up to 150 lbs. to all
locations within the state. The company offers radio
dispatched messenger service and guarantees the deliv-
ery of all parcels within one hour after pick-up.
Quicksilver, whose service is limited to pick-ups and
deliveries within the state, does not make any deliver-
ies outside Lansing. A large percentage of Quicksilver's
business, however, consists of delivering packages to
local airlines for eventual shipment out-of-state.

The Lansing state legislature has just enacted a statute
imposing a $1 tax on each delivery transaction con-
ducted by private courier businesses operating within
the state. According to the new law, the tax is to be paid
by all companies engaged in the business of providing
courier service.

1. Can Lansing impose this tax on Quicksilver's

delivery operations within the state?

(A) Yes, because the transaction on which this tax
is imposed is severable from the interstate
delivery of such packages.

(B) Yes, because the commerce power of the fed-
eral government does not limit the taxing
authority of the states.

(C) No, because a large percentage of
Quicksilver's packages are shipped out-of-
state by the other carriers, the tax unduly bur-
dens interstate commerce.

(D) No, because the tax violates Quicksilver's

rights of equal protection.

Congress passes an act requiring that all owners of
bicycles in the United States to register them with a fed-
eral bicycle registry. The purpose of the law is to pro-
vide reliable evidence of ownership to reduce bicycle
theft. No fee is charged for the registration. Although
most stolen bicycles are kept or resold by the thieves in
the same cities in which the bicycles were stolen, an
increasing number of bicycles are being taken to cities
in other states for resale.

2.	

Is this act of Congress constitutional?

(A) Yes, because Congress has the power to regu-

late property for the general welfare.

(B) Yes, because Congress could determine that in
inseverable aggregates bicycle thefts affect
interstate commerce.

(C) No, because most stolen bicycles remain
within the state in which they were stolen.
(D) No, because the registration of vehicles is a
matter reserved to the states by the Tenth
Amendment.

(C)	
In U.S. v Lopez,  115 S.Ct 1624 (1995) the Supreme Court invalidated a federal
statute which imposed criminal penalties on persons who possess a firearm within 1,000
feet of a school building. The Court held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was
unconnected to interstate commerce and did not have a real effect on multistate commer-
cial concerns. As a result, the federal law could not be upheld under Congress' commerce
power. In this question, we have a subtle variation inasmuch as Congress is requiring the
states to enact legislation criminalizing firearm possession. In all likelihood, this would be
deemed unconstitutional because Congress cannot "commandeer the legislative processes
of the states by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory pro-
gram." See New York v. United States,  505 U.S. 144 (1992). In New York,  the Court held
that there are limits to Congress' right to interfere with the states' lawmaking processes,
and Congress will violate the Tenth Amendment if it exceeds those limits.

Multistate Variation:

The state of Marvista passes a law making it a crime to knowingly possess a firearm within
1,000 feet of a school building. The state passes the law in response to public concerns
about the safety of school children due to the increase in shootings and violent crime in
and around school buildings. Is the law constitutional? Answer: Yes, under the state's
police power. Pavlov Dog Answer: No, because it violates the Commerce Clause.

(B)	
Under Article I, Section 8, Congress shall have the power "To regulate Commerce
with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." This ple-
nary federal commerce power is held concurrently with the states, which may freely gov-
ern matters which do not require uniform national regulation. For a state regulation
affecting interstate commerce to pass judicial scrutiny, the statute must be found  reason-
able and nondiscriminatory  upon balancing the benefit to the state against the burden
imposed on interstate commerce such that  no less restrictive alternative means  of regula-
tion is available. Where a state statute may pose a discriminatory or undue burden on out-
of-state interests, the USSC applies a "balancing test," see  Pike v. Bruce Church, 397 U.S.
137 (1970). Luxury's strongest argument is that the North Durango "Window Tint" Act
effectively prevents Luxury Limousine Company from doing business in its state. Luxury's
strongest constitutional argument to invalidate the statute would be the Commerce Clause
challenge presented in answer Choice (B). Note, however, that the state's interest in safety
regulation, on balance, would likely outweigh the burden on interstate commerce claimed
by Luxury. Choice (A) is incorrect because all motor vehicles in North Durango are treated
equally under the law. Choice (D) is incorrect because strong support is given in the facts
to demonstrate that the purpose for enacting the "Window Tint" Act was neither arbitrary
nor unreasonable.

merce within their own borders. Such regulation will generally be upheld if it is purely
local (intrastate), and neither produces a lack of uniformity which is of federal concern nor
is already preempted by federal legislation in the area. Since (C) presents a case of purely
intrastate commerce, the regulation will likely be upheld. Choice (A) is not the best choice.
Although this is precisely the situation the legislation was probably intended to prohibit,
Rutherford's regulation of an out-of-state vendor with respect to in-state sales would
unduly burden interstate commerce. Choices (B) and (D) are not the best choices. Both sit-
uations involve state action in an area preempted by the federal government. In choice (B),
the state statute purports to regulate a sale to the United States government, an area of
intergovernmental immunity. In choice (D), the state statute purports to affect commerce
with foreign powers, an area reserved to the federal government.

This question is based on the decision in  Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co.,  419
(A)	
U.S. 345 (1974), in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the actions of a public utility did
not involve sufficient state action to subject it to constitutional restraint on the basis of its
monopoly and government regulation. In  Jackson, an electric company terminated service to
a customer without having a full hearing to determine the status of the account or the cus-
tomer's willingness to pay new charges. The Court did not decide whether the customer would
have been entitled to a hearing had the utility been a part of the governmental structure.
Instead, a majority of the Justices held that the termination of service by the utility would not
be subject to constitutional review as it did not constitute state action. By analogy, choice (A)
is the correct answer in this similar licensing question.

A claimant challenging under the Equal Protection Clause must demonstrate that
(C)	
state action exists. Here, the rate setting policies of the private insurance company do not
involve "state action." The Calzona laws only regulate the licensing and solvency of insur-
ance companies, not the premiums charged. State licensing of a private entity is not suffi-
cient to render the discriminatory practices of the private entity "state action" within the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment  (Moose Lodge v. Irvis (1972)). Choice (A) is not
the best choice. Congress has, by federal statute, authorized the states to regulate the poli-
cies and practices of insurance companies operating within the state boundaries. This has
been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the state to regulate in a discrimina-
tory manner which would, absent the authorization of Congress, violate the negative impli-
cations of the Commerce Clause. However, this conferral of discriminatory power does not
allow the states to discriminate in a manner which would be so arbitrary, capricious or irra-
tional as to violate the Equal Protection Clause  (Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Ward
(1985)). The power of the states to regulate the insurance companies is not plenary. Choice
(B) is not the best choice. There is no "state action" present requiring Good Neighbor to
justify its discriminatory premium. The Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause
only applies to actions by state and local governments, not to private companies even
where licensed by the state. Since Good Neighbor is only a private company which has not
engaged in "state action," it does not need a good reason to discriminate. Choice (D) is not
the best choice. Discrimination practiced by a purely private entity does not have to satisfy
the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. Thus, a court
would not even apply the Equal Protection Clause when Paul challenges the premium
increase instituted by a private insurance company.

26.	

Because the legislature's purpose in enacting the statute was to upgrade medical
(A)	
care for the elderly, there is a rational basis for excluding new, non-M.D. hearing aid ven-
dors. Choice (B) is not the best choice. There is no fundamental right to pursue a particu-
lar occupation without meeting training or education requirements. Choice (C) is not the
best choice. Patients purchasing hearing aids from non-physicians have the same legal
rights under the statute as those purchasing from physicians. Furthermore, the choice of

Classifications based on gender are subject to intermediate scrutiny whereby the
government bears the burden to show that the action being challenged is substantially
related to an important interest. In fact, based on the recent holding in  United States v.
Virginia, 116 S. Ct. 2264 (1996)—Virginia Military Institute's "men only" program held
invalid—gender discrimination cases now require the government to show an "exceedingly
persuasive justification," a more vigorous test that is closer to strict scrutiny than to "mere
rationality" review. This test applies where the statute is  intended  to classify on the basis
of sex. Such is not the case here. Before jumping to the conclusion that this question
involves gender discrimination just because Victoria was not hired due to her sex, students
must focus on the government conduct itself. First, the state law requiring one shower for
every ten employees was neutral on its face, not intended to discriminate based on gender.
Second, the permit rejection by the city of Hoboken was based on failure to conform to the
local building code, not based on intentional gender discrimination. It is important to
remember that in sex-discrimination cases, the plaintiff is required to show a  discrimina-
tory purpose,  not merely a discriminatory effect. Here, the city's action does not trigger
intermediate scrutiny because there was no gender-motivated purpose behind the permit
rejection. Therefore, Choice (A) is incorrect. Rational basis analysis applies instead, and
Victoria will have the burden of persuasion. Choice (C) is the correct answer.

(A)	
One of the most striking expansions of the substantive due process doctrine in recent
years has been in the area of family relations.  As a general rule, the Supreme Court has found
that a person's decision about how to  conduct his or her family relationships (e.g., marriage,
child birth, child rearing and cohabitation with one's relatives) often rises to the level of a
`fundamental right".  Consequently, the state may interfere with such a decision only when it
shows the regulation is necessary for the fulfillment of a compelling public interest. Here, we are
dealing with a state law regulating child birth which will be subject to a "strict scrutiny" standard
of review. Since the facts indicate that the regulation was enacted because of public health
concerns, it does further a compelling state interest. Choice (A) is the best answer.

(D)	
Under the Supreme Court decision in  Moore v. City of East Cleveland,  a city may not
define a "family" to include only certain categories of related individuals. In Moore, the Court
struck down an ordinance which would have precluded a grandmother and grandson from liv-
ing together, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause protects freedom of
choice in matters of marriage and family life. Note, however, that municipalities may  validly
prohibit unmarried, unrelated  individuals from sharing the same residence.  (Village of Belle
Terre v. Boraas 416 U.S. 1 (1974)).

(C)	
With respect to abortion, the trimester test of Roe has been partially overruled by
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). As a
result of Casey, the states may restrict abortion so long as they do not place any "undue
burden"  on the woman's right to choose. Here, the Islandia statute does place an "undue
burden" on the right to abortion because after the first three months a woman can only
have an abortion to protect her health and life.  Choice (A) is not the best answer because
it utilizes the "fundamental" right to privacy language articulated in Roe v. Wade  rather
than the current "undue burden"  test. Choice (B) is wrong because the Court does not
apply intermediate scrutiny in abortion cases.

(B)	
The right to be a candidate is related to the fundamental right to vote. In general the
state's interest in limiting ballot access is twofold: (1) to reduce voter confusion, and (2) to
maximize the probability that the winning candidate will have received a majority of the pop-
ular vote. In Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, (1974), a California provision which prohibited
independent candidates from running in the general election if the candidates either had voted
in the immediately preceding party primary or had registered their party affiliation with a
qualified party within one year of the primary was upheld. The Court determined that the "dis-
in the stability of the political sys-
affiliation" statute furthered the state's compelling interest 
tem, and its interest in having "intraparty feuds" resolved in primaries rather than in the
general election. Based on the Court's application of the  strict scrutiny standard of review,
choice (B) is the correct answer. The Court noted further in  Storer that the state must adopt
reasonable alternative means for independent candidates and minor political parties to get a
ballot position, and the alternative means must not place too heavy a burden on the right to
vote and the right to associate.

Since 1976, Mass. Board of Retirement v. Murgia,  427 U.S. 307, the Supreme Court
has consistently applied the rational basis test for government classifications based on age.
Under this "soft" test, the Supreme Court has never struck down an age classification as uncon-
stitutional. See, e.g., Vance v. Bradley,  440 U.S. 93 (1079) (federal law requiring retirement at
age 60 for employees in the Foreign Service Retirement System, held constitutional);  Gregory
v. Ashcroft,  501 U.S. 452 (1991) (Missouri mandatory retirement age of 70, for most state
judges, held constitutional). This question is very similar to the facts in  Breck v. Michigan,  203
F. 3d 392 (6th Cir. 2000), where the Court of Appeals upheld a Michigan statute which denied
judicial candidacy to any person who was at least 70 years of age on election day for that judi-
cial office, 530 U.S. 1244 (2000).

porting or opposing a ballot referendum was held unconstitutional. In Buckley v. Valeo,  424
U.S. 1 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that  spending limits imposed on candidates for pub-
lic office are unconstitutional as violative of political speech under the First Amendment,
because such restrictions on the amount of money a person or group can spend "reduces the
quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their explo-
ration, and the size of the audience reached."  Buckley  at 19. On the other hand, reasonable
limits on campaign contributions do not violate the First Amendment  because such contri-
butions to candidates create a greater "danger of corruption and the appearance of corruption"
than spending limitations. Contribution limits do not have to meet strict scrutiny and will be
upheld if the government demonstrates they are "closely drawn" to match a "sufficiently
important [government] interest," such as to prevent "corruption" and its "appearance." See,
Randall v. Sorrell, 126 S. Ct. 2479 (2006). A Vermont law placing contribution limits on can-
didates for statewide office, such as governor to $400, state senators $300 and state represen-
tatives $200, was held too low to withstand First Amendment scrutiny. Contribution limits that
are too low can harm the election process by preventing challengers from mounting effective
campaigns against incumbent officeholders. Compare as to what is reasonable:  Nixon v.
Shrink Missouri Government PAC,  528 U.S. 377 (2000), upholding limits on campaign con-
tributions ranging from $275 to $1,075 on candidates for state office.

The city is discriminating against non-residents with respect to one of the privileges
(C)	
and immunities of state citizenship protected by Article IV, Section 2—the right to pursue a
livelihood. This clause protects non-residents from being discriminated against by state or
local governments with respect to certain "basic rights" and "essential activities" of state cit-
izenship. Among these are the right to own property, equal access to medical care and the
courts, and the right to earn a living. Here, Medford's commuter tax discriminates against
non-resident workers. Where discrimination against the employment rights of non-residents is
found to exist, the law will be struck down unless the responsible state or local government
can show such discrimination is closely related to a substantial government interest. In cases
of discrimination against non-residents in employment contexts, the Supreme Court has
required the government to show that the non-residents are a "peculiar source of the evil the
law was designed to redress." Here, if Medford businesses are not making enough money, the
Court is not likely to allow the city to tax non-residents who (quite conveniently, are not able
to vote in Medford city elections) are not shown under to facts to be the sole cause of poor
business revenues of local merchants. See Austin v. New Hampshire (1975), in which the
Court struck down a similar income tax imposed upon non-residents as violative of Article IV,
Section 2, Privileges and Immunities Clause. Therefore, choice  (B) is incorrect since the law
will be held invalid. Choice (A) is also not the best choice. Government action within the
police power recognized by the 10th Amendment is not the sole inquiry in deciding whether
it is constitutional, it must also comply with all limitations of government power which the
Constitution contains. Here, the employment tax on non-residents is violative of the Article
IV, Section 2, Privileges and Immunities Clause because the discriminatory application of the
tax is not closely related to any substantial government interest. Thus, the police power alone
is not enough to justify this tax. Choice (D) is incorrect. The discrimination against non-resi-
dents imposed by the tax is not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. As a general rule,
an equal protection challenge will only be successful if the discriminatory government action
is such that strict scrutiny or heightened scrutiny will be applied by the court. These tests will
only be applied where intentional discrimination against a suspect class, fundamental interest,
gender or illegitimacy is found to exist. Here, the discrimination involves non-residents
(which is not a suspect class) and the right to work (which is not a fundamental right).
Consequently, this discrimination will only be judged under the  rational basis test. Under this
test, the claimant has the burden of proof to show that the government action is not rationally
related to any legitimate government interest. Courts almost never strike down laws under this
test, especially when the law relates to economics. Here, the Medford employment tax would
be presumed to be rationally related to a legitimate city interest in raising revenue.

Procedural due process guarantees a fair decision-making process before the gov-
ernment takes some action directly impairing an individual's life, liberty, or property interests
under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Where such a deprivation occurs which is seri-
ous in nature, the procedural safeguards of notice and opportunity to be heard (i.e., hearing)
are available. Substantive due process, on the other hand, is a very broad area which judges
the compatibility of the substance of government legislation  with the Constitution. Fishman
can prove that his restaurant complies with the municipal licensing ordinance, yet Carson City
officials have denied him a license. To guarantee a fair decision-making process, Fishman can
strongly argue that he should have been granted an opportunity to be heard and a statement of
the reasons for his license denial since the right to engage in gainful employment is a "liberty"
interest protected by the safeguards of procedural due process. Whenever the government
takes an action which is designed to deprive an individual, or limited group, of the freedom to
engage in some significant area of human activity, such as terminating the individual's ability
to engage in a profession, some procedure to determine the legality of such action is required
by the Due Process Clause. Nowak, Constitutional Law, p. 408. Choice (A) is therefore
correct.

(C) In Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff,  467 U.S. 229 (1984), the Supreme Court
held that the Government satisfies the Public Use Clause if it can demonstrate that the
"exercise of the eminent domain power is rationally related to a conceivable public pur-
pose." Midkiff  at 241. More recently in Kelo v. City of New London,  545 U.S. 469 (2005),
the Supreme Court reaffirmed that courts must give broad deference to a legislature's judg-
ment as to what constitutes a public use. In Kelo, a divided Supreme Court ruled that a
broad economic redevelopment plan by a city to eradicate economic blight and high unem-
ployment is a legitimate public use under the Fifth Amendment. Choices (A), (B), and (D)
are all incorrect because they misstate the appropriate burden and standard. Note: Choice
(A) is incorrect because the Supreme Court has never held that property ownership is a fun-
damental constitutional right. Choice (D) is tempting, however, the Supreme Court has clearly
held the burden is on the government to justify its reasons for taking private property.

(C) A law that applies to named individuals or an easily ascertainable group in a man-
ner that inflicts a punishment without a judicial trial is an unconstitutional  bill of attainder.
Here, the state legislature passed a licensing law which expressly revoked Chester's license
without the benefit of a trial. Since he was singled out by name in the law and punished with-
out a trial, the State Z law is an unconstitutional bill of attainder. Choice (A) is incorrect.
There is no discrimination against non-residents of State Z which would be required for an
effective Article IV, Section 2, privileges and immunity challenge. Choice (B) is not the best
choice. State licensing laws for doctors, lawyers and other professions are uniformly upheld
because they do not discriminate or impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. This leg-
islation would not be subject to challenge because it does not discriminate or burden interstate
commerce. The fact that one acupuncturist, Chester, was prohibited from practicing acupunc-
ture is not sufficient to show that interstate commerce has been burdened. Moreover, there is
no individual right to engage in interstate commerce.

(A) The Ex Post Facto Clause forbids both the states and the federal government
from enacting retroactive criminal laws. The most common sort of an ex post facto law
is one which creates a new crime and applies it retroactively to conduct not criminal at the
time committed. In addition, the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits the retroactive application
of an increase in the punishment for a crime which carried a lesser penalty when commit-
ted. Another aspect of the ex post facto prohibition is concerned with  retroactive changes
in evidence and procedure which operate to the disadvantage of the criminal defendant
by making conviction easier.  Thus, a statute which changes the burden of proof on the
prosecution from the usual rule of "beyond a reasonable doubt" to one of "preponderance
of the evidence" is ex post facto, if retroactive. By analogy, in this hypo we have a situa-
tion where the legislature changed the unanimity jury verdict requirement after the defen-
dant was arrested and charged with robbery. As such, choice (A) is correct.

(D) Laws that prohibit the posting of signs on public property are constitutional.
Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent,  466 U.S. 789 (1984).
However, once the government voluntarily decides to open public property to some forms
of speech, it creates a "limited or designated public forum" and any "restriction must not
discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint and must be reasonable in light of
the purpose served by the forum." In addition, any licensing or permit system that leaves
significant discretion to the licensing official or "unfettered discretion" to award or deny
permits is facially unconstitutional.  Forsyth County, Georgia v. Nationalist Movement,  505
U.S. 123 (1992)—an ordinance that required a permit for demonstrations and allowed the
permit official unlimited discretion to charge a fee up to $1,000, was held unconstitutional
because of a lack of articulated standards or objective factors.

(D)	
Based upon the decision in Wooley v. Maynard,  430 U.S. 705 (1977), Choice (D) is
correct. In Wooley,  the Supreme Court held that a motorist has a free speech right not to be
prosecuted for covering up the New Hampshire state motto, "Live Free or Die," on his license
plate. As long as the license plate was left in a condition that served "its auto identification
purpose," the state's interest in promoting pride and an appreciation of history and individu-
alism was insufficient to justify the restrictions on free speech. Accordingly, a state cannot
force an individual to be an instrument of an ideological point of view with which he (or she)
disagrees.

41.

Under the so-called "affectation doctrine," the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized

(A)	
that Congress has the power to regulate any activity, whether carried on in one state or
many, which has any appreciable effect—directly or indirectly—upon interstate commerce.

42. (B)	

The South Bend ordinance may be attacked as a violation of protected First Amend-
ment freedom of expression since it prohibits  all singing and chanting for twelve  hours every
day in areas which are traditionally viewed as  public forums.  Time, place, manner limitations
on speech-related conduct are permitted when achieved by  reasonable content-neutral  regu-
lations which further a significant governmental purpose. Such an ordinance must be narrowly
drawn so as not to establish a total ban on protected rights of free speech. Since the South
Bend ordinance does not appear to satisfy this standard, a First Amendment free speech attack
by the students will be a strong challenge. Therefore, choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (C) is
also incorrect because it presents a strong challenge in the form of the vagueness and over-
breadth doctrines. By proscribing protected as well as prohibited speech for half of each day
everywhere in the city the ordinance is clearly overbroad on its face. Similarly, due to the
uncertainty-producing effect as to what conduct is restricted by the words "singing and chant-
ing of songs" and "audible (to whom?) off the premises," a vagueness challenge should be
successful. Choice (D), another strong argument, is incorrect since non-religious songs—
which are certainly areas of protected speech—are being treated differently than religious
songs, thereby raising an equal protection challenge to be reviewed using the strict scrutiny
standard. By process of elimination, choice (B) is correct because the due process argument
it presents is the weakest basis to attack the ordinance.

MBE Exam Tip:  When a Multistate question is phrased in a  negative tense,  it may prove help-
ful to apply the following approach:

Step 1:  Eliminate all correct statements;
Step 2:  Look for false statement;
Step 3:  Choose wrong statement of law.

43. (B) Government owned property is a public forum that the government is constitutionally
required to make available for speech-related activities. Parks, sidewalks and city streets are
traditional classic public forums. The government may regulate speech thereon if certain stan-
dards are met: (1) the regulation must be content neutral (unless strict scrutiny is met), (2) the
regulation must be a reasonable time, place, manner restriction that serves a significant gov-
ernmental interest, that (3) leaves open adequate alternative places for speech, and (4) gives
clear guidelines to the licensing official that leaves no room for arbitrary discretion. See, e.g.,
City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co.,  486 U.S. 750 (1988).

(A)	
Related to the state's power to use zoning laws to restrict "adult" speech is the state's
power, under the Twenty-First Amendment, to regulate "adult" speech in establishments
licensed by the state to serve liquor. The Twenty-First Amendment has long been used to grant
the states extensive authority over liquor, and to some extent immunize state regulation from
Commerce Clause challenge as well. In New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca,  452 U.S.
714, the Supreme Court upheld New York's power to ban topless dancing in establishments
licensed to serve liquor.

Multistate Caveat: A state statute prohibiting nude entertainment in places that serve no
alcohol but only food or nonalcoholic beverages, may violate the First Amendment.  Nudity
alone is not per se obscene in the constitutional sense.

(D)	
The Dichondra statute contains the three elements of the  Roth-Miller definition of
obscenity: (1) the material must have as its dominant theme the appeal to prurient sexual inter-
ests; (2) it must be patently offensive to contemporary community standards; and (3) the mate-
rial must lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific merit  (Roth v. United States  354
U.S. 476 (1957); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973)). It is entirely proper under this def-
inition for the "patently offensive" prong of the test to be applied based on local community
standards. (Note, however, that local community standards may not be used to apply the "seri-
ous value" prong of the Roth-Miller test; that determination must be made using the "reason-
able person" standard.) Choices (A) and (B) are not the best choices. An individual's First and
Fourteenth Amendment rights are circumscribed by the right of the community to prohibit
pornographic exhibitions in public theaters.

(D)	
Quite often Multistate Constitutional Law questions are based upon case prece-
dent. This question, for example, is based upon ruling in  44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island,
517 U.S. 484 (1996) in which a Rhode Island statute prohibited all advertising of liquor
prices, except for price tags displayed with the merchandise. The Supreme Court invali-
dated the law because regulations of commercial speech must be "narrowly tailored" and
should be no more extensive than is necessary.  In both 44 Liquormart and in our ques-
tion, the state is attempting to regulate unprotected commercial speech (i.e. vice advertis-
ing). Choice (D) is correct because a state will not be permitted to  completely ban
commercial advertising but must use a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired
objective.

(D)	
The key issue in this question does not deal with either case or controversy, stand-
ing or diversity of citizenship. Therefore, choices (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect. Rather,
the issue is whether a court of law can adjudicate a suit between rival religious groups of
the same church in determining whether a sacrificial ritual is a proper church tenet. A sim-
ilar problem dealing with unusual religious beliefs and practices was presented in the case
of United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 (1944). In Ballard, defendant was prosecuted for
mail fraud where he solicited money on the representation that he was a divine messenger
and had the divine power to heal incurable diseases. The Court, adopting a strict neutral-
ity approach to the Free Exercise Clause, held that the First Amendment barred submitting
to the jury the question of whether his religious beliefs were true. Writing for the Court,
Justice Douglas stated: "The religious views espoused by respondents might seem incred-
ible, if not preposterous, to most people. But if those doctrines are subject to trial before a
jury charged with finding their truth or falsity, then the same can be done with the religious
beliefs of any sect. When the triers of fact undertake that task, they enter a forbidden
domain."

(B)	
Since 1990, the Supreme Court has used a rational basis test when a state law is chal-
lenged under the Free Exercise Clause, provided the state law is: (1) neutral, (2) of general
application, and (3) the law is not intended to burden religious freedom.  Employment
Division, Department of Human Resources v. Smith,  494 U.S. 872 (1990). In Smith,  the
Supreme Court abandoned strict scrutiny (compelling state interest test) in most cases under
the Free Exercise Clause except  (1) cases involving unemployment benefit. See, Sherbert v.
Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), and (2) compulsory school attendance laws where a religious
exemption is sought. See, Wisconsin v. Yoder,  406 U.S. 205 (1972) (Amish case). Free
Exercise challenges to laws requiring production of social security numbers are routinely
denied. See, 93 A.L.R. 5th 1 (2001). See also, Brunson v. Department of Motor Vehicles,  72
Cal. App. 4th 1251 (1999) (rejecting free exercise claim against providing social security
numbers for driver's license).

(C)	
This same freedom of religion issue was tested on a recent MBE. The facts derive
from a New York law which allowed local school boards to adopt regulations for the use of
school property, at times when schools were not in session. In Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School District, the Moriches Union School Board authorized the use
of (public) school property, when it was not otherwise being used for school purposes, for
social, civic or recreational uses and for uses by political organizations. However, the school
board denied a religious congregation the ability to use the school property at a time when
classes were not in session and the school was not being used for previously scheduled activ-
ities. In Lamb's Chapel, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the school board's regu-
lation violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment because it constituted
viewpoint discrimination.  Based on the holding in Lamb's Chapel, choice (C) is correct.

50. (C)	

Another issue commonly tested on the MBE deals with  whether religious mem-
In McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.S. 618
bers are precluded from holding government offices. 
(1978), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state law that prevented
"Minister(s) of the Gospel, or priest(s) of any denomination whatever from serving as del-
egates to the state constitutional convention." Interestingly enough, the disqualification of
clergy members from legislative office existed in England and was followed by seven of
the original states. The Supreme Court, however, found that this history was  not decisive
and invalidated the state law. The majority of Justices ruled that the free exercise of reli-
gion allowed members of the clergy to hold government office.  Based on the holding in
McDaniel, the appointment of a member of the clergy to a governmental agency or com-
mission would not per se be violative of the Establishment Clause.

ARTICLE III — vests the judicial power in the Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress may establish; jurisdiction limited to "cases and

controversies" — cases arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States, and cases in which the United States is a party.
Compare: Article I Courts (tax courts, courts in the District of Columbia) are vested with administrative, as well as judicial functions; no lifetime
tenure for Article I judges. Role of Congress: plenary power both to establish lower federal courts and to confer and remove jurisdiction over
Article III courts
Note that Article III courts may not give advisory opinions, although state courts may do so

POWER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW —  Marbury v Madison  — held the Supreme Court may determine the constitutionality of acts of other branches of government;

federal courts may also review state court decisions

JURISDICTION OF THE USCC — Original (trial level) — extends to "all cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a
State shall be a Party"; Congress may neither enlarge nor restrict, but may give concurrent jurisdiction to lower federal courts
(except in cases between 2 or more states where the USSC has exclusive jurisdiction)
Appellate — extends to all other Article III cases and controversies; Congress may broadly regulate, but may not preclude
review of an entire class of cases

TWO STATUTORY MEANS Provided by Congress to Invoke USSC Appellate Jurisdiction: 1. Appeal (mandatory review) — applies to decisions of 3-judge

federal district courts regarding injunctive relief
2. Certiorari (discretionary; 4 or more justices vote to hear a case) — applies to decisions of the highest state courts regarding the
constitutionality or violation of federal law, and decisions of US Courts of Appeal

STANDING — concrete personal stake in the outcome is required

Constitutional Standard (required by Article III) — Injury in Fact — specific, not theoretical, injury must arise from the government conduct being
complained of; usually economic injury, but need not be
Redressibility (Causation) — the relief sought must eliminate the harm alleged; plaintiff's injury must be within the "zone of interests" Congress
meant to protect
Prudential Limitations — self-imposed by the Court; no "citizen" standing for abstract, generalized grievances; a corporation has standing to
challenge a federal statute where the injury is to the organization itself.
No third party standing, unless plaintiff herself has suffered injury which adversely affects her relationship with third parties, who have difficulty
asserting their own rights
No taxpayer standing because the interest is too remote, except a federal taxpayer has standing to make an establishment clause challenge to
an expenditure which exceeds some specific limitation on the taxing and spending power  (Flast v Cohen)

MOOTNESS — a case brought too late; an actual controversy must exist at all stages of review, unless the issue is capable of repetition, yet evading review

(pregnancy, elections)

RIPENESS — a case brought too early; a genuine, immediate threat of harm must exist (no declaratory judgment allowed before a law is enforced)

POLITICAL QUESTIONS — nonjusticable issues committed to other branches of government (i.e. foreign affairs, Guaranty Clause issues; congressional mem-

bership requirements; but not apportionment of legislative districts)

11TH AMENDMENT — provides a state cannot be sued in federal court without consent; however, state officials may be sued for federal law violations; local
governments can be sued; the United States or another state may sue a state; Congress can remove a state's immunity (i.e. for civil
rights violations)

ABSTENTION — Pullman doctrine applies where a federal claim is based on an unsettled issue of state law; procedurally, the federal court retains jurisdiction

of the federal claim
Younger doctrine prohibits review/enjoining of pending state criminal proceedings, criminally related civil proceedings, and civil contempt
proceedings; procedurally the party is sent back to state court for all purposes

ADEQUATE AND INDEPENDENT STATE GROUNDS — The USSC will not review a final judgment from the highest state court that the case may reach where

the state decision was based on a clear, adequate, independent and fully dispositive nonfederal ground

protect any health, safety, welfare, morals, or aesthetics interest

NECESSARY AND PROPER CLAUSE — grants Congress the authority to carry into execution any enumerated power; not an independent source of power

COMMERCE POWER — plenary power which regulates both domestic and foreign commerce

Affectation Doctrine — regulates any activity which has a substantial economic effect on the stream of interstate commerce
Cumulative Impact Doctrine — even an entirely intrastate activity which has a cumulative impact on interstate commerce may be
regulated

TAXING AND SPENDING POWER —  plenary power to tax and spend for the general welfare; general welfare clause is not an independent source of power
Spending Power — Congress can attach strings to federal appropriations, thereby regulating indirectly where it cannot
legislate directly
Taxing Power — a federal tax is valid if the dominant intent is fiscal; direct taxes (income tax) must be apportioned; indirect
taxes (sales, use and excise taxes) must be geographically uniform

WAR POWER — to declare war, raise and support an army and navy, and make rules to regulate the armed forces; pervasive economic regulatory power during

war; regulation may continue even after cessation of hostilities

OTHER ENUMERATED POWERS — postal power; power over District of Columbia; power to coin money; to propose Constitutional amendments; immigration and

naturalization; copyright, patent, bankruptcy powers; impeachment power

IMPLIED POWERS — broad investigatory power enforceable by contempt sanction; plenary admiralty power

LEGISLATIVE VETO — Congress can delegate its legislative power to executive and administrative agencies, but cannot subsequently retract it — such a

"legislative veto" is unconstitutional  (INS v Chadha)

DOMESTIC POLICY — Power and obligation to faithfully execute the laws

Appointment Powers — President can appoint purely executive officers (Cabinet members), ambassadors, public ministers, consuls and
USSC judges "with the advice and consent of the Senate"; Congress may not appoint members of bodies having administrative or
enforcement powers, and may only appoint its legislative staff members; Congress can delegate appointment of "inferior officers" (special
prosecutor) to either the President or the judiciary; the President may dismiss an independent counsel for good cause
Removal Powers — the Constitution is silent; the President may remove purely executive officers (Cabinet members) without cause, but
good cause is required to remove federal judges and other fixed-term administrative officials; Congress has no power of summary removal
Veto Power — President has 10 days to exercise his veto, which may then be overridden by 2/3 vote of each house; President has no
legislative power nor any power to impound funds
Pardon Power — extends only to federal crimes, not state crimes
Executive Privilege — to refuse to disclose information (military and diplomatic secrets); privilege must yield to important government
interests
Absolute immunity in civil suits for damages based on actions taken while in office

FOREIGN POLICY — Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces — may establish military governments in occupied territories; broad emergency powers

Treaty Power — requires consent of 2/3 of the Senate; where conflict between 2 laws exists apply the following hierarchy:

1. Constitution
2. Treaty/Act of Congress — equal footing; last in time prevails
3. Executive Agreement
4. State Law

Executive agreement — informal means by which the President can conduct day-to-day economic and business transactions between foreign
countries without Senate consent
Foreign Affairs — President's power is not plenary, but is shared with Congress; sources of such power include: 1) Commander-in-chief;
2) Treaty Power; 3) Congressional Authorization (delegation by Congress of its commerce power to the President)

Article VI, §2

STATE REGULATION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT —  FG and its agencies are immune from state taxation and regulation; however, scriminatory

state taxes on federal contractors are valid; a state may not require a state coor's license
to build on federal property located within the state

FEDERAL PROPERTY POWER (Art. IV, §3) — Congress may dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territoryier property

of the United States; generally applies to wild animals, federal buildings and enclaves, militaos and
planes, Indian reservations

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE STATES — states are not immune under 10th or 11th amendments (FG may sue a statestate may

sue another state); FG may tax proprietary state businesses

10TH AMENDMENT — powers not delegated to the FG, nor constitutionally prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states; a weak limitati the federal

commerce power; FG may not compel states (rather than private entities) to enact a particular regulatory program [i.e.ate
radioactive waste or take title to it — NY v U.S.)]

NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS DOCTRINE —  where Congress has not otherwise regulated, the states are free to regulate interstate commercelation must
be 1) non-discriminatory — may not favor or protect local interests, and 2) not unduly burdensorrstate interest
is balanced against the burden on interstate commerce such that no less restrictive alternative mis available

EXCEPTION — Market Participant Doctrine — where the state uses its own taxpayer funds to create the market, it may favor its own residenh subsidies

and hiring preferences

COMPARE: Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause — prevents discrimination by one state against citizens of another state regarding bconomic

rights and liberties; N/A to corporations or aliens

REQUIREMENTS: state tax must be reasonable and nondiscriminatory to satisfy the Commerce Clause, and a substantial nexus (i.e. more minimum
contacts") must exist between the state interest and the activity being taxed to satisfy the Due Process Clause

GENERAL PRINCIPLES — goods or commodities "in the stream" of interstate commerce are exempt from state taxation, but may be taxed beginning

and end of transit, as well as if there is a break in transit
Instrumentalities (cars, planes, trains, etc.) may be taxed provided the tax is fairly apportioned to the extent of taxl use (taxable
situs requirement)

PREEMPTION — any state law in an area where Congress intends to occupy the field is unconstitutional (i.e., FAA, NLRB)

SUPERSESSION — any state law in actual conflict with a federal law will be unconstitutional. Note: where federal law only establishes minimandards,

states may afford greater protection by enacting stricter laws than required by federal standards (i.e. health and safety !lions)

PROTECTED LIBERTY INTERESTS — commitment to a mental institution; right to contract; right to engage in
gainful employment; right to refuse unwanted medical care; right of natural parents in the care and custody of their
children; not injury to reputation

PROPERTY INTERESTS (entitlements) —  right to public education; welfare benefits; liability benefits; continued
public employment where termination can only be "for cause"; revocation of a driver's license

a taking consists of either a confiscation (public easement granted across owner's beachfront property) or a physical occupation (cable TV wire installed in all the
hallways of city rental units) or a regulation which denies the owner all reasonable economically viable use (post-purchase zoning ordinance which prohibits the
owner from erecting any permanent structures on his land)

ECONOMIC REGULATION  —
regulation must meet rational
basis scrutiny

FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS  —
regulation must meet strict
scrutiny standard

RIGHT TO VOTE — other than for minimum age or residency requirements or payment of reasonable filing fees, regulation must meet the
strict scrutiny standard. Generally voting districts for federal, state, and local elections are required to adhere very closely to the one person-
one vote principle (Reynolds v. Sims); exception for special limited-purpose districts (water storage district). Apportionment and districting
schemes which distort voting districts for racial or political purposes is unconstitutional gerrymandering
RIGHT TO TRAVEL — durational residency requirements are invalid for receiving state medical care or welfare benefits, but valid for
reduced tuition at state universities, obtaining a divorce, or registering to vote in a state primary election; foreign travel is subject only to
rational basis scrutiny
RIGHT TO PRIVACY (mnemonic CAMPER) — Contraception — applies to the sale and use of contraceptives by both married and
unmarried persons
Abortion — states may not prohibit abortions, but may regulate as long as they create no "undue burden" on the right to obtain an abortion
(Planned Parenthood v. Casey);  there is no right to abortion funding, even for indigents; consent of one or both parents or a judge, may be
required for a minor to obtain an abortion
Marriage — any restriction on the right to marry (interracial marriage) is prohibited
Procreation — closely related to contraception
Education — right of parents to educate their children outside of public schools

enough to punish a religious belief); conduct in furtherance of those beliefs may be regulated; e.g. use of peyote during religious
ceremonies is conduct which may be prohibited despite the individual's religious beliefs which required this practice  (Oregon v
Smith); a Jewish soldier may be compelled by the Air Force not to wear his yarmulke as part of his military uniform  (Goldman v
Weinberger); to regulate conduct the Court balances the severity of the burden on the individual's free exercise of religion
against the government interest in regulation

ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE — Main Principle: the government may not aid or prefer one religion or sect over another, subject to strict scrutiny review;

— Test: to be constitutional, a sect-neutral government aid/program must satisfy 3 requirements under the Lemon test — the law
must 1) have a secular purpose; 2) have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and 3) not foster excessive
government entanglement with religion
— General Principles: government sponsored religious activities in public schools are unconstitutional (daily Bible readings; a
moment of silent, voluntary prayer; prohibition of the teaching of evolution); government aid to parochial schools may not be used
for religious purposes (use of textbooks, busing, health tests), but such aid is constitutional if made available to all students at
public and private schools
— Tax Deduction — reimbursing parents for tuition paid only to  religious schools is invalid; similarly, tax exemptions available only for
religious organizations (no sales tax for religious publications) is an invalid endorsement of religion, but property tax exemptions for
religious property have been upheld; religious displays (nativity scenes; menorahs) are permissible in public places provided no
one religion is being favored over another

Freedom of
Speech Approach

4 TYPES OF FACIAL ATTACKS — Overbreadth — statute punishes both protected as well as unprotected speech

Vagueness — statute is so unclearly defined that persons of ordinary intelligence must guess at its meaning
Prior Restraint — government action restricting free speech in advance of publication is generally invalid (licensing permits,
injunctions; 'gag' order barring the media from pretrial publicity); valid where national security interests are compelling, or the
regulation of obscene books and films where procedural safeguards are afforded
Unfettered Discretion — where a licensing official has unfettered discretion as to whether to confer or deny a permit

ESSAY APPROACH
Track One
Ask: Is the Speech the Statute is Regulating  Content Specific
(regulates the message) 

If content specific, then ask: Is the speech
being regulated Protected or Unprotected

Unprotected
includes clear and
present danger;
defamation;
obscenity; child
pornography; fight-
ing words; fraudulent
commercial speech

If "protected" then
apply strict scrutiny
i.e. — the statute
is unconstitutional
unless the govern-
ment can show the
law is necessary to a
compelling interest

unmentioned First Amendment
right encompassing activities
such as accepting government
benefits, public employment or
seeking membership in various
organizations

or 

Track Two
Content Neutral —Time, Place, Manner Regulation

(statute exists regardless of the message)  

If content neutral regulation of time, place, man-
ner, then apply a 3-part test: the regulation must
1)further a significant government interest

(noise, crowd, or litter control; traffic safety)
2) be narrowly tailored (no more restrictive than

necessary), and

3) leave open alternative channels of communi-
cation (commercial door-to-door solicitation
without invitation of the homeowner may be
restricted because other avenues of commu-
nication exist such as the mail, newspaper
advertisements, radio and television)

Freedom of the Press —  read together with the "free
speech" clause as a single
guarantee; generally the press
has no greater privilege than
the ordinary citizen

\

Public Employment and Bar Membership — may not be denied based upon an individual's group affiliation unless
the government can show the person 1) is a knowing (scienter) and active (dues-paying) member of a subversive
group and 2) has the specific intent to further the group's unlawful objectives  (Kevishian v Bd. of Rights)
Loyalty Oaths — generally invalid as a condition to public employment, however, an oath to support the Constitution
and oppose overthrow of the government has been upheld (Cole v Richardson)
Disclosure Requirements — to avoid a chilling effect on First Amendment activities disclosure is generally not
required, unless the government could make such membership illegal

Right of Access — both the public and the press have a right to attend a criminal trial, which may be outweighed by
an overriding government interest
Newsperson's Privilege — no privilege exists to refuse to disclose confidential sources to a grand jury  (Branzburg v
Hayes), but states may enact "shield" laws to afford such protection
Broadcasting — may be regulated more closely than the press due to the limited number of frequencies available —
"equal time" broadcasts may be required (Red Lion), yet on the other hand a newspaper need not provide equal space
for political rebuttal (Miami Herald)

FIRST AMENDMENT
GUARANTEES

Freedom of
Speech Content 

most forms of speech are
protected subject to the strict
scrutiny standard; 6 forms of
unprotected speech may be
regulated 

Time, Place, Manner
Restrictions

reasonable restriction of speech
 conduct is permitted by means 	
of content-neutral time, place,	
manner regulations

CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER  — speech 1) directed at producing imminent unlawful action and 2) likely to produce

such action (Brandenburg v Ohio)

DEFAMATION — public officials, public figures, and limited public figures (those who voluntarily inject themselves in

the limelight) must prove malice: knowing falsity or reckless disregard for the truth  (Times v Sullivan)

— private person plaintiffs — constitutional limitations apply only where the defamatory statement

involves a matter of public concern, in which case negligence must be proven (no liability without
fault); punitive damages are not awarded absent proof of malice  (Gertz v Welch)

OBSCENITY — to be obscene, the speech must 1) appeal to the prurient interest in sex applying contemporary

community standards, 2) depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and 3) lack serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value (Miller v California)

— merely offensive language is not obscene; however, profane language on the airways may be

restricted (Pacifica Foundation) private possession of obscene materials in one's home is protected
(except for child pornography), although viewing, sale and distribution of such obscene material may
be vigorously regulated (movie ratings, zoning ordinances)

CHILD PORNOGRAPHY — outside the protection of the First Amendment; visual depictions of sexual conduct

including children may be punished even if not "obscene" under  Miller (N.Y. v Ferber)

FIGHTING WORDS — restricted speech includes personally abrasive language likely to invite the average person to

commit acts of physical violence (Chaplinsky v N.H.); however, statutes designed to punish
only particular viewpoints are invalid — e.g. fighting words that provoke violence on the basis of
race, religion, or gender (R.A.V. v St. Paul)

FRAUDULENT COMMERCIAL SPEECH — generally commercial speech is protected but may be restricted as to
false or deceptive advertising or illegal products; a lawful, narrowly tai-
lored regulation will be valid if it directly advances a substantial govern-
ment interest and there is a reasonable "fit" between the means used and
the legislation's end (Central Hudson; SUNY v Fox); attorneys may adver-
tise, provided it is not misleading; in-person solicitation for profit is not
protected.

OTHER AREAS — symbolic speech (where the medium itself is the message) may be restricted where the regulation
furthers an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of speech and the incidental
burden on speech is no greater than necessary; e.g. unconstitutional to ban flag burning (U.S. v
Eichman)

— freedom not to speak — allows children not to be compelled to salute or pledge allegiance to the
American flag, and allows a motorist to cover the motto ("Live Free or Die") portion of her license
plate

PUBLIC FORUMS — (streets, parks, sidewalks) — regulations must satisfy 3-part test (See Track Two test)

NONPUBLIC FORUMS — (jails, military bases, mailboxes, billboards, public buses, government buildings, airport

terminals)

— to be valid the regulations must be 1) viewpoint neutral (i.e. content may be regulated, but
limiting the presentation to only one view is impermissible) and 2) reasonably related to a
legitimate government interest

Licensing Statutes

REQUIREMENTS — to be valid, a licensing scheme must relate to an important government objective, be clearly written, narrowly

drawn, and reasonably regulate time, place and manner of speech

IF STATUTE IS VALID ON ITS FACE  — the speaker may not ignore the statute and must seek a permit. If the request is denied, even

wrongfully, the speaker must nonetheless seek prompt judicial relief before speaking; otherwise
a subsequent claim of violation of 1st Amendment rights will fail

IF STATUTE IS VOID ON ITS FACE  — due to overbreadth, vagueness, prior restraint, or unfettered discretion) — the speaker may

ignore the statute and speak, as well as successfully defend against any subsequent prosecution
(Shuttlesworth v Birmingham)

IF AN INJUNCTION IS ISSUED — where the speaker is enjoined from speaking, she must obey the injunction (even if it is facially

invalid) or appeal from it. Invalidity of the injunction must be established on appeal and is no defense
to a subsequent charge of contempt  (Walker v Birmingham)

Question 4 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for breach of contract. The court admitted testimony by the plaintiff that the
defendant and his wife quarreled frequently, a fact of no consequence to the lawsuit. The defendant seeks to
testify in response that he and his wife never quarreled. The court 

A: must permit the defendant to answer if he had objected to the plaintiff's testimony.
B: may permit the defendant to answer, whether or not he had objected to the plaintiff's testimony.
C: may permit the defendant to answer only if he had objected to the plaintiff's testimony.
D: cannot permit the defendant to answer, whether or not he had objected to the plaintiff's testimony.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The defendant's testimony, while it would normally be considered irrelevant, is
admissible as curative evidence to respond to the previously admitted irrelevant evidence about his quarreling
with his wife. A court may, but does not have to, admit irrelevant evidence if the evidence is curative and
rebuts the previously admitted irrelevant evidence and the curative evidence is not prejudicial. 

Answer A and C are incorrect because the defendant is not required to object to the introduction of the initial
irrelevant evidence before he can ask for the admission of curative evidence. In addition, the court has
discretion in determining whether or not curative evidence must be admitted. For example, if an instruction to
the jury would suffice to counter the previous introduction of irrelevant evidence, the court does not have to
admit additional irrelevant evidence, even if it is curative. Answer D is incorrect because the court has
discretion to either admit, or refuse to admit, curative evidence.

Question 18 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A physician, who was called as a witness by a defendant, was asked to testify to statements made to the
physician by her patient for the purpose of obtaining treatment. Which of the following is the best basis for
excluding evidence of the patient's statements in a jurisdiction with a doctor-patient privilege? 

A: An objection by the physician asserting her privilege against disclosure of confidential communications
made by a patient.
B: An objection by the plaintiff's attorney on the grounds of the doctor-patient privilege.
C: A finding by the trial judge that the patient had left the office without actually receiving treatment.
D: The assertion of a privilege by the patient's attorney, present at the trial as a spectator at the patient's
request, and allowed by the trial judge to speak.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The doctor/patient privilege is held by the patient, not the physician. Only the patient,
or a lawyer acting on his behalf, has the right to invoke and waive the privilege. The patient's attorney, if he is
acting on the patient's behalf and is allowed to speak by the trial judge, may invoke the patient's privilege and
would be the best basis for excluding the evidence. 

Answer A is incorrect because the doctor/patient privilege resides with the patient, and the doctor does not
provide the best basis for objecting to the disclosure. Answer B is incorrect because the doctor/patient
privilege resides with the patient and cannot be asserted by an attorney who is not representing the patient.
Answer C is incorrect because the doctor/patient privilege extends to statements made while seeking
treatment and whether or not the patient actually received the treatment is irrelevant to the determination of the
admissibility of the evidence. Even if the judge determines that the patient had left the office without actually
receiving treatment, the evidence can still be excluded under the doctor/patient privilege if the patient, or his
attorney on his behalf, assert the privilege. An assertion of the doctor/patient privilege by the patient's attorney,
acting at his behest, is the best basis for excluding the evidence of that patient's statements to his doctor.

Question 19 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A leading question is LEAST likely to be permitted over objection when 

A: asked on cross-examination of an expert witness.
B: asked on direct examination of a young child.
C: asked on direct examination of a disinterested eyewitness.
D: related to preliminary matters such as the name or occupation of the witness.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Leading questions are generally not permitted if they are asked on direct examination
of a disinterested eye witness. Answer A is incorrect because leading questions are permitted on
cross-examination, regardless of whether the witness is an expert or not. Answer B is incorrect because
leading questions are much more likely to be permitted by the court if the witness is a child. Answer D is
incorrect because leading questions are permitted to be asked on preliminary matters that do not require
testimony about the facts at issue. Leading questions on direct examination of a disinterested witness are the
least likely of the examples to be permitted if there is an objection.

Question 52 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

The plaintiff sues a bar for injuries suffered in an automobile accident caused by a patron of the bar. The
plaintiff claims that the patron was permitted to drink too much liquor at the bar before the accident. 

A witness, who was present at the bar on the night of the incident, testified that on the night of the accident the
patron was drunk. The witness then proposed to testify about his remark to his companion on just how drunk
the patron appeared. The witness's remark to his companion is 

A: admissible as an excited utterance.
B: admissible as a prior consistent statement.
C: admissible as a statement by the witness regarding a condition he observed, made while he was observing
it.
D: inadmissible if there was no evidence that the witness had expertise in determining intoxication.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. A statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant
was perceiving the event or condition is admissible as a present sense impression; this is an exception to the
hearsay rule. The witness's descriptive statement was made as the witness was perceiving the patron's
condition, which is what makes it admissible here as a present sense impression. 

Answer A is incorrect because there is no evidence that the witness's statement was made under the stress of
an exciting event that would make it admissible as an excited utterance. The patron's intoxication is not
enough to constitute an exciting event for the purposes of this hearsay exception; nothing in the facts indicate
that the witness was surprised, startled, or otherwise emotionally affected by the patron's being drunk. Answer
B is incorrect because the witness's statement would be improperly bolstering his own testimony; prior
consistent statements are inadmissible before the witness's testimony has been attacked on
cross-examination. Answer D is incorrect because the witness's statement is admissible as a present sense
impression, and because a witness need not be an expert in order to testify to his or her own direct
observations. Lay witness testimony regarding a bar patron's intoxication is admissible.

Question 53 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

The plaintiff sues a bar for injuries suffered in an automobile accident caused by a patron of the bar. The
plaintiff claims that the patron was permitted to drink too much liquor at the bar before the accident. 

The bar called the patron to testify and expected him to say that he was sober when he left the bar; however,
on direct examination the patron testified that he may have had a little too much to drink at the bar. The bar
now seeks to confront the patron with his statement made on deposition that he was sober when he left the
bar. Which of the following is true concerning this statement? 

A: It may be used only to refresh the patron's recollection.
B: It is admissible for impeachment and as substantive evidence that the patron was sober.
C: It is inadmissible, because the bar cannot impeach its own witness.
D: It is inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Prior inconsistent statements, given by a witness who is subject to cross examination
on the stand, can be used both as an impeachment and as substantive evidence if they were given under oath
and under penalty of perjury. Because the patron's testimony at the trial is inconsistent with his sworn
testimony from the deposition, the statement from the deposition is admissible to impeach the patron's current
testimony. The statement is also admissible as substantive evidence as a prior inconsistent statement. 

Answer A is incorrect because prior sworn statements are not necessarily limited to refreshing recollection.
Additionally, nothing indicates that the patron was having any difficulty recollecting prior events; difficulty of
recollection is a necessary prerequisite for this exception. Answer C is incorrect because parties may impeach
any witness, even their own. Answer D is incorrect because prior inconsistent statements given under oath at
a deposition are not hearsay if the witness is testifying at trial and is subject to cross-examination; such prior
sworn statements may be admitted for their substantive as well as impeachment value.

Question 55 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

The plaintiff sues a bar for injuries suffered in an automobile accident caused by a patron of the bar. The
plaintiff claims that the patron was permitted to drink too much liquor at the bar before the accident. 

The plaintiff offers evidence that, after the accident, the owner of the bar visited him at the hospital and,
offering to pay all of the plaintiff's medical expenses, said, "That's the least I can do after letting the patron
leave the bar so drunk last night." The statement that the patron was drunk when he left the bar on the night of
the accident is 

A: admissible as an admission by the owner of the bar that the patron was drunk when he left the bar.
B: admissible as a factual admission made in connection with an offer of compromise.
C: inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
D: inadmissible as a statement made in connection with an offer to pay medical expenses.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The owner's statement that the patron was drunk when he left the bar is admissible
as an admission by a party opponent. Although the offer to pay medical expenses would be inadmissible, the
accompanying statement that the patron was drunk is an admissible admission by the owner. 

Answer B is incorrect because it misstates the rule regarding offers to compromise, if this truly was a factual
admission made in connection with an offer to compromise, then the statement would be inadmissible.
Furthermore, on these facts there is no offer to compromise, instead this is a naked offer to pay medical
expenses. Answer C is incorrect because an admission by a party opponent is specifically excluded from the
definition of hearsay. Answer D is incorrect because statements accompanying a naked offer to pay medical
expenses are not covered by the exclusionary rule, and are admissible.

Question 56 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

In a narcotics conspiracy prosecution against the defendant, the prosecutor offers in evidence a tape recording
of a telephone call allegedly made by the defendant. A lay witness is called to testify that the voice on the
recording is the defendant's. Her testimony to which of the following would be the LEAST sufficient basis for
admitting the recording? 

A: She had heard the same voice on a similar tape recording identified to her by the defendant's brother.
B: She had heard the defendant speak many times, but never over the telephone.
C: She had, specifically for the purpose of preparing to testify, talked with the defendant over the telephone at
a time after the recording was made.
D: She had been present with the defendant when he engaged in the conversation in question but had heard
only the defendant's side of the conversation.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The recording can be authenticated by the testimony of a lay witness who, through
first-hand knowledge, is familiar with the defendant's voice. However, the testimony of the witness in answer A
is the least likely to provide a sufficient basis for admitting the recording. The witness's knowledge of the
defendant's voice in answer A is based solely on the hearsay statement of the defendant's brother. The
witness in answer A has no first-hand knowledge of the defendant's voice. 

Answer B is incorrect because first-hand knowledge of a voice, even if not over the telephone, is sufficient to
authenticate an audiotape identification. Answer C is incorrect because the witness may become familiar with
the defendant's voice at any time. Answer D is incorrect because the witness was present during the recording
of the conversation and can reliably identify the defendant's voice on the tape.

Question 116 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant is tried for armed robbery of a bank. 

The prosecution, in its case in chief, offers evidence that when the defendant was arrested one day after the
crime, he had a quantity of heroin and a hypodermic needle in his possession. This evidence should be 

A: admitted to prove the defendant's motive to commit the crime.
B: admitted to prove the defendant's propensity to commit crimes.
C: excluded, because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
D: excluded, because such evidence may be offered only to rebut evidence of good character offered by the
defendant.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Because the defendant is on trial for armed robbery, evidence of his commission of
other crimes is inadmissible against him because it is much more prejudicial than probative. The fact that the
defendant had illegal substances on his person when he was arrested has very little probative value on the
issue of whether or not he committed the armed robbery, and it is highly prejudicial to the defendant. 

Answer A is incorrect because, although proof of other crimes may be used to show motive, the mere
possession of illegal substances the day after the crime has very little relevance to prove that motive. In
addition, the possession, even if it were relevant to prove motive, would still be more prejudicial than probative.
Answer B is incorrect because evidence of other crimes is not admissible to prove propensity to commit crimes
in general. Answer D is incorrect because the general character of the accused cannot be shown through
specific incidents of conduct. More importantly, the evidence should be excluded because it is simply more
prejudicial than probative.

Question 118 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant is tried for armed robbery of a bank. 

At the request of police, the teller who was robbed prepared a sketch bearing a strong likeness to the
defendant, but the teller died in an automobile accident before the defendant was arrested. At trial the
prosecution offers the sketch. The sketch is 

A: admissible as an identification of a person after perceiving him.
B: admissible as past recollection recorded.
C: inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
D: inadmissible as an opinion of the teller.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The sketch amounts to an out-of-court statement of an unavailable witness and is
inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. The sketch is a statement by the teller that the man depicted
committed the robbery, and, since the teller is unavailable to testify, the sketch should be found to be
inadmissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because the exception to the hearsay rule that allows the introduction of a statement of
identification after perceiving the person requires that the declarant be available at the trial and subject to
cross-examination. Since the teller is unavailable, the sketch would not meet the requirements of that
exception to the hearsay rule. Answer B is incorrect because the past recollection recorded exception to the
hearsay rule only applies if the witness is available on the stand to testify as to the sketch. If the witness is
unavailable, the prior statement, in this case in the form of a sketch, remains an out-of-court statement that is
being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and should be held inadmissible. Answer D is incorrect
because it ignores the fact that the statement is hearsay. The sketch is inadmissible hearsay and should not
be allowed into evidence.

Question 119 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant is tried for armed robbery of a bank. 

The defendant testified on direct examination that he had never been in the bank that had been robbed. His
counsel asks, "What, if anything, did you tell the police when you were arrested?" If his answer would be, "I
told them I had never been in the bank," this answer would be 

A: admissible to prove that the defendant had never been in the bank.
B: admissible as a prior consistent statement.
C: inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because it was a self-serving statement by a person with a substantial motive to fabricate.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The defendant's prior statement to the police that he had never been in the bank is an
out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that he had never been in the
bank. It should be found to be inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. 

Answer A is incorrect because, although the prior statement to the police is being offered to prove that the
defendant had never been in the bank, it is still hearsay without any exception, and is thus inadmissible.
Answer B is incorrect because prior consistent statements are only admissible to rebut an express or implied
charge against the declarant of recent fabrication, improper influence, or motive. Here, the defendant's counsel
asked the question on direct examination, before any of those charges were made on cross-examination, so
the defendant's prior statement to the police is inadmissible hearsay. Until there is a charge made on
cross-examination of recent fabrication, improper influence, or motive, the statement is inadmissible. Answer D
is incorrect because it misstates the relevant evidentiary requirements for the admission of out-of-court
statements. The fact that the statement is self-serving and made by a person with a motive to fabricate does
not make it inadmissible. The statement is inadmissible because it is hearsay not within any exception.

Question 120 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant is tried for armed robbery of a bank. 

On cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor asks him whether he was convicted of tax fraud the
previous year. The question is 

A: proper to show that the defendant is inclined to lie.
B: proper to show that the defendant is inclined to steal money.
C: improper, because the conviction has insufficient similarity to the crime charged.
D: improper, because the probative value of evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Evidence of prior crimes is admissible to impeach the testimony of a witness if the
crime is a felony or a crime of dishonesty. The defendant's prior conviction for tax fraud is admissible to attack
the credibility of his testimony, and a question regarding his prior conviction is proper. 

Answer B is incorrect because the prior conviction can only be used to impeach the defendant's testimony; it
cannot be used to prove conduct in conformity with it. If the defendant had not testified, the prior conviction
could not be used against him. Answer C is incorrect because it ignores the use of the prior conviction for
impeachment. The prosecution does not need to show that the crimes are similar in any way before the prior
conviction can be used to impeach the defendant's testimony. Answer D is incorrect because the prior
conviction is highly probative as to the defendant's credibility and is being used only as impeachment and not
to prove conduct in conformity with the prior conviction. Since the prior conviction is being used to impeach the
defendant's testimony, it is probative and the question is proper.

Question 130 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for a libelous letter received by an investigator. The authenticity and contents of
the letter are disputed. 

The plaintiff's attorney asks the investigator to testify that, a week before receiving the libelous letter, he had
written to the defendant inquiring about the plaintiff. The testimony is 

A: admissible because this inquiry was made in the regular course of the investigator's business.
B: admissible without production of the inquiry letter or the showing of its unavailability.
C: inadmissible because the plaintiff's attorney had not given the defendant notice of the investigator's
intended testimony.
D: inadmissible because the inquiry letter itself was not shown to be unavailable.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The investigator's testimony about his prior inquiry concerning the plaintiff is
admissible, without producing the inquiry letter or proving its unavailability, because the investigator's
testimony that the initial inquiry letter was sent authenticates the defendant's letter under the reply-letter
doctrine. Under that doctrine, while the contents of the original letter are irrelevant and do not have to be
proven, evidence that the inquiry letter was sent suffices to authenticate the reply letter. 

Answer A is incorrect because the inquiry letter does not have to arise from the regular course of business
before the investigator could testify to sending the letter. Answer C is incorrect because the plaintiff does not
have to inform the defendant about the investigator's plan to testify to sending the inquiry letter. Answer D is
incorrect because the investigator could testify that the inquiry letter was sent to the defendant without proving
unavailability of the inquiry letter.

Question 147 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant was tried for the July 21 murder of a victim. In his case in chief, the defendant called his first
witness to testify to the defendant's reputation in his community as a "peaceable man." The testimony is 

A: admissible as tending to prove the defendant is believable.
B: admissible as trying to prove the defendant is innocent.
C: inadmissible, because the defendant has not testified.
D: inadmissible, because reputation is not a proper way to prove character.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. A criminal defendant is permitted to introduce evidence of his good character, if
relevant to the charge, to attempt to prove he is innocent. The witness's testimony as to the defendant's
reputation as a "peaceable man" is admissible to prove he is not guilty of murder. 

Answer A is incorrect because the defendant's being a "peaceable man" is irrelevant to the determination as to
whether the defendant is believable or not. It is relevant, however, to his character for non-violence. Answer C
is incorrect because the defendant does not have to testify before evidence of his peaceable nature is
admissible to prove he did not commit the crime. Answer D is incorrect because reputation is a proper way to
prove character. The defendant is permitted to put in evidence of his peaceable character to attempt to prove
he did not commit the offense of murder.

Question 148 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant was tried for the July 21 murder of a victim. 

The defendant called a witness to testify that on July 20 the defendant said that he was about to leave that day
to visit relatives in a distant state. The testimony is 

A: admissible, because it is a declaration of present mental state.
B: admissible, because it is not hearsay.
C: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The defendant's statement to the witness describes the defendant's current mental
condition, that being his intention to visit relatives in a distant state. The statement should be admissible under
the 'then existing mental condition' exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer B is incorrect because the defendant's statement is an out-of-court statement offered into evidence for
the truth of the matter asserted, and is thus hearsay. However, the statement is being offered to try and prove
the defendant intended to leave the area where the murder occurred and is admissible under the 'then existing
mental condition' exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer C is incorrect because the evidence is clearly relevant to establish the defendant's state of mind
concerning a possible alibi defense to the murder, namely the defendant's intent to leave for a distant state. 

Answer D is incorrect because, although the statement is hearsay, it is admissible under the 'then existing
mental state' exception to the hearsay rule. Because the defendant's statement to the witness is being offered
to prove the defendant's intent to visit relatives in a distant state, it is hearsay; however, the statement is
admissible to show the defendant's mental condition at the time the statement was made.

Question 149 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant was tried for the July 21 murder of a victim. 

The defendant called a witness to testify to his alibi. On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecution
asked, "Isn't it a fact that you are the defendant's first cousin?" The question is 

A: proper, because it goes to bias.
B: proper, because a relative is not competent to give reputation testimony.
C: improper, because the question goes beyond the scope of direct examination.
D: improper, because the evidence being sought is irrelevant.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Questions regarding familial relations between a witness for the defense and the
defendant are proper to probe for the possible existence of bias or the witness's motive to lie. Answer B is
incorrect because the witness is being called to testify to an alibi, not to give reputation evidence. In addition,
answer B is incorrect because a relative of the defendant is not automatically incompetent to give evidence of
reputation. Answer C is incorrect because questions regarding a witness's prejudice, bias, or motive to lie can
be raised at any time and are proper regardless of whether those issues were raised on direct examination.
Answer D is incorrect because the existence of a familial relationship between a witness and a defendant is
probative of the issue of whether the witness has any bias or motive to lie, and is thus relevant.

Question 150 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant was tried for the July 21 murder of a victim. 

The defendant called a witness to testify to his alibi. On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecutor
asked, "Weren't you on the jury that acquitted the defendant of another criminal charge?" The best reason for
sustaining an objection to this question is that 

A: the question goes beyond the scope of direct examination.
B: the probative value of the answer would be outweighed by its tendency to mislead.
C: the question is leading.
D: prior jury service in a case involving a party renders the witness incompetent.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Because there is no implication of bias simply because a witness was on a jury that
previously acquitted the defendant, the question is improper. The witness's service on a jury at the defendant's
earlier trial, even if the jury acquitted the defendant, is at best minimally probative. In order to prevent the jury
from speculating about the other case, or drawing improper conclusions about the witness's prior jury service,
the question should not be allowed. 

Answer A is incorrect because matters affecting the credibility of a witness are allowed on cross-examination,
regardless of whether or not they were raised on direct examination. Answer C is incorrect because leading
questions are permitted during the cross examination of a witness. Answer D is incorrect because prior jury
service in a case involving a party does not render the witness incompetent. The limitations placed on a juror's
service only apply to the immediate case the juror is sitting on and inquiries into the validity of the verdict. It
does not foreclose the possibility of that juror ever testifying in another case involving the parties. The best
reason for sustaining an objection is that the question lacks probative value, and any probative value the
question does have is outweighed by the question's tendency to mislead the jurors.

Question 161 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A clerk was held up at gun point with an unusual revolver with a red painted barrel while she was working in a
neighborhood grocery store. A defendant is charged with armed robbery of the clerk. 

The prosecutor calls a witness to testify that, a week after the robbery of the clerk, he was robbed by the
defendant with a pistol that had red paint on the barrel. The witness' testimony is 

A: admissible to establish an identifying circumstance.
B: admissible to show that the defendant was willing to commit robbery.
C: inadmissible, because it is improper character evidence.
D: inadmissible, because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Evidence of other crimes, while generally not admissible, can be admitted to prove
things other than the defendant's criminal disposition. The acronym "MIMIC" identifies relevant purposes for
admitting such evidence: Motive, Intent, Mistake, Identity, or Common scheme or plan. In this question,
because the gun was very unusual, the testimony of the witness is admissible to establish the identity of the
robber by establishing that the identifying characteristic was present in the earlier crime. 

Answer B is incorrect because the evidence of the defendant robbing the witness is admissible only to prove
identity, not to prove the defendant's willingness or penchant for committing robberies. 

Answer C is incorrect because the evidence of the defendant's robbery is not being offered as character
evidence; instead, it is being offered to establish the identity of the person who robbed the clerk. While
evidence of other crimes is generally considered improper character evidence, there is an exception when the
evidence is being used for a MIMIC purpose. 

Answer D is incorrect because the probative value of the witness's testimony in identifying the robber
outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice.

Question 184 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A bus passenger sued the transit company for injuries to his back from an accident caused by the company's
negligence. The company denies that the passenger received any injury in accident. 

The passenger's counsel seeks to introduce an affidavit he obtained in preparation for trial from a physician,
who has since died. The affidavit avers that the physician examined the passenger two days after the
company's accident and found him suffering from a recently incurred back injury. The judge should rule the
affidavit 

A: admissible as a statement of present bodily condition made to a physician.
B: admissible as prior recorded testimony.
C: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The physician's affidavit is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth
of the matter asserted and should be inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.  

Answer A is incorrect because the affidavit concerns the physician's examination of the passenger, not just the
passenger's statements to the physician of present bodily condition. Although the statements the passenger
made to the physician for the purposes of medical treatment may be admissible, the affidavit regarding the
physician's evaluation of the passenger would be inadmissible hearsay. 

Answer B is incorrect because an affidavit is insufficient to be considered "former testimony" that would be an
exception to the hearsay rule. The affidavit was not subject to cross-examination by the party to the suit, which
may allow for the development of the testimony, and would not be admissible under the prior testimony
exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer C is incorrect because the physician's examination, done just two days after the accident, finding that
the passenger had suffered a recent back injury is clearly relevant to the issue of whether the passenger
suffered an injury in the accident. Although relevant, the physician's affidavit is still inadmissible hearsay. Since
the affidavit was not prior testimony and not subject to cross-examination, it is hearsay not within any
exception.

Question 185 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A bus passenger sued the transit company for injuries to his back from an accident caused by the company's
negligence. The company denies that the passenger received any injury in accident. 

The company calls an observer to testify that right after the accident, the passenger told him that he had
recently suffered a recurrence of an old back injury. The judge should rule the observer's testimony 

A: admissible as an admission of a party opponent.
B: admissible as a spontaneous declaration.
C: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The passenger's statement that he suffered from a recurrence of an old back injury is
a statement that is being offered against the passenger to show he was not injured in the accident. The
passenger's statement is an admission by a party opponent and is thus not hearsay.  

Answer B is incorrect because there is no evidence that the passenger was under the stress of the excitement
of a startling event when he made the statement. The passenger's statement would not be considered an
excited utterance or a spontaneous declaration. Answer C is incorrect because the statement indicates that
the passenger had suffered a back injury before the accident and had recently had a recurrence of the injury.
This evidence is clearly relevant to the issue of whether the passenger was actually injured in the accident and
whether the injury was caused by the accident. Answer D is incorrect because hearsay is specifically defined
to exclude admissions by a party opponent. The passenger's statement to the observer is an admission by a
party opponent and should be admissible.

Question 193 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

An automobile driver sues a company for injuries suffered when the automobile driver's car collided with one of
the company's trucks. The company's general manager prepared a report of the accident at the request of the
company's attorney in preparation for the trial and delivered the report to the attorney. The automobile driver
demands that the report be produced. Will production of the report be required? 

A: Yes, because business reports are not generally privileged.
B: No, because it is a privileged communication from client to the attorney.
C: No, because such reports contain hearsay.
D: No, because such reports are self-serving.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Confidential communications between an attorney and client made during legal
consultation are privileged, and the production of them will not be required. The report of the company's
general manager was made at the request of the company's attorney in preparation for trial and is a
confidential communication protected by the attorney-client privilege. 

Answer A is incorrect because the report was done at the behest of the attorney and in preparation for trial, so,
although it is a business record, it is also privileged and should not be required to be produced. Answer C is
incorrect because whether or not the report contains hearsay is irrelevant to the determination of whether the
report is a privileged communication. Answer D is incorrect because whether or not such reports are
self-serving is also irrelevant to the determination of whether the report is a privileged communication. Since
the report is covered by the attorney-client privilege, production of the report is not required.

Question 197 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for injuries received in an automobile accident, alleging
negligence in that the defendant was speeding and inattentive. The plaintiff calls a witness to testify that the
defendant had a reputation in the community for being a reckless driver and was known as a "dare-devil." The
witness' testimony is 

A: admissible as habit evidence.
B: admissible, because it tends to prove that the defendant was negligent at the time of this collision.
C: inadmissible, because the defendant has not offered testimony of his own good character.
D: inadmissible to show negligence.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. Evidence of a person's character is inadmissible to prove the individual acted in
conformity with such character on a particular occasion. The defendant's reputation in the community as a
"dare-devil" is inadmissible to prove he acted negligently on this occasion. 

Answer A is incorrect because the evidence sought to be admitted here is character evidence of the
defendant's reputation, not evidence of the defendant's habits. Habit evidence consists of a routine, specific
practice, not a general reputation, and is offered to show a pattern of habitual action. Answer B is incorrect
because the witness's testimony is offered only to show that, on the date in question, the defendant was acting
consistent with his reputation. This type of evidence is inadmissible in civil cases. Answer C is incorrect
because the witness's testimony is not being used to rebut any evidence of the defendant's good character. It
is being offered to show conduct consistent with a bad reputation. Given this fact situation, the witness's
testimony is an attempt to prove the defendant's negligence by showing a reputation for negligence and will be
found to be inadmissible.

Question 202 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

In a suit attacking the validity of a deed executed fifteen years ago, the plaintiff alleges mental incompetency of
the grantor, and offers into evidence a properly authenticated affidavit of the grantor's brother. The affidavit,
which was executed shortly after the deed, stated that the brother had observed the grantor closely over a
period of weeks, that the grantor had engaged in instances of unusual behavior (which were described), and
that the grantor's appearance had changed from one of neatness and alertness to one of disorder and
absentmindedness. The judge should rule the brother's affidavit 

A: inadmissible as opinion.
B: inadmissible as hearsay, not within any exception.
C: admissible as an official document.
D: admissible as an ancient document.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The brother's affidavit is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of
the matter asserted, namely that the grantor had begun displaying unusual behavior. Thus, the brother's
affidavit is hearsay and inadmissible because it is not within any exception. 

Answer A is incorrect because eyewitness opinion can be relevant and admissible; this affidavit is only
inadmissible because it is hearsay. Answer C is incorrect because there is no "official document" exception to
the hearsay rule that would allow for the admissibility of an affidavit. Answer D is incorrect because the ancient
document exception requires that the document be authenticated and be over twenty years old. The brother's
affidavit, only 15 years old and not self-authenticating, does not fit that exception. Therefore, the brother's
affidavit is inadmissible hearsay and should be found to be inadmissible.

Question 214 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

A defendant has denied his purported signature on a letter which has become critical in a breach of contract
suit between the defendant and the plaintiff. At trial, the plaintiff's counsel calls a teacher who testifies that she
taught the defendant mathematics in school ten years earlier, knows his signature, and proposes to testify that
the signature to the letter is that of the defendant. 

The defendant's counsel objects. The trial judge should 

A: sustain the objection on the ground that identification of handwriting requires expert testimony and the
teacher does not, per se, qualify as an expert.
B: sustain the objection on the ground that the best evidence of the defendant's handwriting would be
testimony by a person who had examined his writing more recently than ten years ago.
C: overrule the objection on the ground that a schoolteacher qualifies as an expert witness for the purpose of
identifying handwriting.
D: overrule the objection on the ground that a layman may identify handwriting if she has seen the person in
question write, and has an opinion concerning the writing in question.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. A non-expert who is familiar with the handwriting in question is permitted to give an
opinion as to the identity of the handwriting. Handwriting is one of the areas in which courts will accept
testimony regarding a lay person's opinion, if the opinion is based on the perception of the witness and the
opinion would be helpful to the trier of fact. 

Answer A is incorrect because identification of handwriting does not need to be given by expert testimony; any
person sufficiently familiar with another's handwriting is allowed to give his opinion. Answer B is incorrect
because the mere fact that there may be someone more familiar with the handwriting does not preclude the
teacher from testifying as to her opinion that the writing is the defendant's. The best evidence rule does not
apply in this case as the original writing is being used. The fact that the teacher has not seen the defendant's
signature in ten years only goes to the weight that the trier of fact should give the testimony. Answer C is
incorrect because the teacher does not need to be qualified as an expert before she is allowed to testify as to
her opinion regarding the defendant's handwriting.

Question 215 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued for injuries she sustained in a fall in a hotel hallway connecting the lobby of the hotel with a
restaurant located in the hotel building. The hallway floor was covered with vinyl tile. The defendants were the
owner of the hotel building and the lessee of the restaurant. The evidence showed that the hallway floor had
been waxed approximately an hour before the plaintiff slipped on it, and although the wax had dried, there
appeared to be excessive dried wax caked on several of the tiles. The hotel owner's defense was that the
hallway was a part of the premises leased to the lessee of the restaurant over which he retained no control.
The lessee denied negligence and alleged contributory negligence. 

The lessee offered to prove, through the restaurant manager, that in the week immediately preceding the
plaintiff's fall, at least 1,000 people had used the hallway in going to and from the restaurant, and the manager
had neither seen anyone fall nor received reports that anyone had fallen. The trial judge should rule this
evidence 

A: admissible, because it tends to prove that the plaintiff did not use the care exercised by reasonably prudent
people.
B: admissible, because it tends to prove that the lessee was generally careful in maintaining the floor.
C: inadmissible, because the manager's testimony is self-serving.
D: inadmissible, because it does not bear on the issue of the lessee's exercise of due care on this specific
occasion.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The absence of similar accidents is generally not admissible to show an absence of
negligence. The court will only have the discretion to admit such evidence if the structural condition involved is
unchanged. Here, the floor was waxed an hour before the plaintiff's fall. Therefore, the structural condition was
changed and the absence of similar accidents will not be relevant to the defendant's exercise of due care on
this particular occasion. 

Answers A and B are incorrect because due to the re-waxing of the floor, the testimony of the restaurant
manager about the previous week is not relevant. Answer C is incorrect because the fact that the testimony is
self-serving is not a proper reason to exclude the restaurant manager's testimony; bias can be raised on
cross-examination.

Question 216 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued for injuries she sustained in a fall in a hotel hallway connecting the lobby of the hotel with a
restaurant located in the hotel building. The hallway floor was covered with vinyl tile. The defendants were the
owner of the hotel building and the lessee of the restaurant. The evidence showed that the hallway floor had
been waxed approximately an hour before the plaintiff slipped on it, and although the wax had dried, there
appeared to be excessive dried wax caked on several of the tiles. The hotel owner's defense was that the
hallway was a part of the premises leased to the lessee of the restaurant over which he retained no control,
and the lessee denied negligence and alleged contributory negligence. 

If the plaintiff offered to prove that the day after she fell, the hotel owner had the vinyl tile taken up and
replaced with a new floor covering, the trial judge should rule the evidence 

A: admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of whether the hotel owner retained control of the hallway.
B: admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of awareness of the unsafe condition of the hallway at the
time of the plaintiff's fall.
C: inadmissible, because there was no showing that the new floor covering would be any safer than the old.
D: inadmissible, because to admit such would discourage a policy of making repairs to prevent further injury,
regardless of fault.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Subsequent remedial measures are inadmissible as evidence of negligence or defect.
However, such evidence is admissible as proof of ownership or control over the property. In this question, the
defense that the hotel owner raised was that he retained no control over the hallway, so evidence that the
hotel owner had the vinyl taken up and replaced is relevant to prove the hotel owner's ownership and control
over the property in question. 

Answer B is incorrect because subsequent remedial measures are not admissible as proof of awareness of an
unsafe condition which had occurred earlier. Answer C is incorrect because the success or failure of the new
flooring is irrelevant to the issues in the case. Answer D is incorrect because it fails to consider the exception
to the rule that subsequent remedial measures are admissible to prove control or ownership.

Question 244 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for $100,000 for injuries received in a traffic accident. The defendant charges the
plaintiff with contributory negligence and alleges that the plaintiff failed to have his lights on at a time when it
was dark enough to require them. 

The defendant calls a bystander to testify that the passenger, who was riding in the plaintiff's automobile and
who also was injured, confided to him at the scene of the accident that "we should have had our lights on." The
bystander's testimony is 

A: admissible as an admission of a party opponent.
B: admissible as a declaration against interest.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because it is opinion.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The passenger's statement that "we should have had our lights on" to the bystander
is an out-of-court statement being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. As such, it is hearsay, and does
not fall into any exception to the hearsay rule and it is thus inadmissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because the passenger is not a party to the suit, and his statement cannot be attributed
to the plaintiff to be considered an admission of a party opponent. The passenger was not the plaintiff's agent,
he was not the plaintiff's representative, he was not a co-conspirator, and the plaintiff did not adopt the
passenger's statement as his own, so the statement is not admissible as an admission by a party opponent.
Answer B is incorrect because there is no evidence that the passenger is unavailable to testify, which would be
necessary to allow the statement in under the statement against interest exception. In addition, the passenger
had no criminal or civil liability for the accident and his statement that the lights should have been on was not
against his own interest. Answer D is incorrect because opinion evidence is admissible. The passenger's
statement is inadmissible because it is hearsay, not because it is opinion.

Question 245 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for $100,000 for injuries received in a traffic accident. The defendant charges the
plaintiff with contributory negligence and alleges that the plaintiff failed to have his lights on at a time when it
was dark enough to require them. 

The defendant offers to have a bystander testify that he was talking to a witness when he heard the crash and
heard the witness, now deceased, exclaim, "That car doesn't have any lights on." The bystander's testimony
is 

A: admissible as a statement of present sense impression.
B: admissible, because the witness is not available to testify.
C: inadmissible as hearsay, not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The witness' statement that "that car doesn't have any lights on" was a statement
describing the condition of the vehicle and was made while the witness was perceiving that condition. Although
the statement was made out of court and is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, it fits the present
sense impression exception to the hearsay rule and is admissible. 

Answer B is incorrect because, for the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule, the availability
of the declarant is immaterial; the witness's unavailability does not render his statement admissible. Answer C
is incorrect because, although the statement is hearsay, it falls under the present sense impression exception
to the hearsay rule. Answer D is incorrect because the Dead Man's Statute is inapplicable to this question
because the bystander has no interest in the estate of the witness. The Dead Man's Statute is to prevent
witness testimony about conversations with a deceased party and is not relevant to this situation.

Question 246 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

An owner and his employee, a driver, consult an attorney about a motor vehicle collision resulting in a suit by
the litigant against the owner and the driver as joint defendants. The attorney calls his investigator into the
conference to make notes of what is said, and those present discuss the facts of the collision and owner's
insurance. The owner thereafter files a cross-claim against the driver for indemnity for any damages obtained
by the litigant. 

The litigant calls the driver to testify in litigant's case in chief to admissions made by the owner in the
conference. On objection by the owner, the court should rule that the driver's testimony is 

A: admissible, because of the presence of persons in the conference other than the attorney and the owner.
B: admissible, because the driver is an adverse party in the lawsuit.
C: inadmissible, because of the attorney-client privilege.
D: inadmissible, because the best evidence is the investigator's notes of the conference.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The attorney-client privilege covers confidential communications between an attorney
and client made during the legal consultation, and those communications are inadmissible in cases with third
party claimants. The litigant's attempt to introduce the owner's statements made during the legal conference
violates the attorney client privilege, and the driver's testimony as to statements made by the owner at the
conference is inadmissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because the mere presence of the investigator in the conference does not act as a
waiver of the attorney-client privilege. Since the investigator was at the conference to take notes that were
meant to be confidential at the request of the attorney, his presence as the agent of the attorney does not
waive the privilege. In addition, the driver's presence at the conference, who was also represented by the
attorney, does not waive the privilege as to litigant. Since everyone in the joint consultation conference was
there pursuant to the legal representation, the communications held in that room were confidential to anyone
outside the meeting. Thus, the attorney-client privilege would prevent the litigant from introducing evidence of
the owner's statements at the joint consultation. 

Answer B is incorrect because the driver and the owner were both clients of the attorney at the time of the
conference, so the communications are still subject to the attorney client privilege in regards to the litigant.
Because the driver was not originally an adverse party to the owner, the communications in the original
meeting were to be confidential to all outside sources, including the litigant. The attorney client privilege still
applies. 

Answer D is incorrect because the best evidence rule deals only with writings, recordings and photographs,
and is based on the idea that original writings are superior to a copies. It would not preclude the testimony of a
witness in this case.

Question 246 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

An owner and his employee, a driver, consult an attorney about a motor vehicle collision resulting in a suit by
the litigant against the owner and the driver as joint defendants. The attorney calls his investigator into the
conference to make notes of what is said, and those present discuss the facts of the collision and owner's
insurance. The owner thereafter files a cross-claim against the driver for indemnity for any damages obtained
by the litigant. 

The litigant calls the driver to testify in litigant's case in chief to admissions made by the owner in the
conference. On objection by the owner, the court should rule that the driver's testimony is 

A: admissible, because of the presence of persons in the conference other than the attorney and the owner.
B: admissible, because the driver is an adverse party in the lawsuit.
C: inadmissible, because of the attorney-client privilege.
D: inadmissible, because the best evidence is the investigator's notes of the conference.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The attorney-client privilege covers confidential communications between an attorney
and client made during the legal consultation, and those communications are inadmissible in cases with third
party claimants. The litigant's attempt to introduce the owner's statements made during the legal conference
violates the attorney client privilege, and the driver's testimony as to statements made by the owner at the
conference is inadmissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because the mere presence of the investigator in the conference does not act as a
waiver of the attorney-client privilege. Since the investigator was at the conference to take notes that were
meant to be confidential at the request of the attorney, his presence as the agent of the attorney does not
waive the privilege. In addition, the driver's presence at the conference, who was also represented by the

there pursuant to the legal representation, the communications held in that room were confidential to anyone
outside the meeting. Thus, the attorney-client privilege would prevent the litigant from introducing evidence of

conference, so the communications are still subject to the attorney client privilege in regards to the litigant.
Because the driver was not originally an adverse party to the owner, the communications in the original
meeting were to be confidential to all outside sources, including the litigant. The attorney client privilege still
applies. 

Answer D is incorrect because the best evidence rule deals only with writings, recordings and photographs,

Question 247 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

An owner and his employee, a driver, consult an attorney about a motor vehicle collision resulting in a suit by
the litigant against the owner and the driver as joint defendants. The attorney calls his investigator into the
conference to make notes of what is said, and those present discuss the facts of the collision and the owner's
insurance. The owner thereafter files a cross-claim against the driver for indemnity for any damages obtained
by the litigant. 

The driver calls the investigator in his defense against the cross-claim. He seeks to have the investigator
testify to an admission made by the owner in the conference. On objection by the owner, the court should rule
the investigator's testimony 

A: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege does not apply, in suits between those conferring with him,
to joint consultations with an attorney.
B: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege does not apply to testimony by one who does not stand in
a confidential relationship with the person against whom the evidence is offered.
C: admissible, because the conference was not intended to be confidential, since it concerned anticipated
testimony in open court.
D: inadmissible, because the owner has not waived the attorney-client privilege.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Although the owner's communications at the joint consultation conference were
confidential to outside parties, they were not confidential as to the driver. Since the driver and the owner are
now adverse parties, statements made by the owner at the joint consultation are not privileged in this case,
and the court should rule the investigator's testimony admissible. 

Answer B is incorrect because the investigator was acting as an agent of the attorney and was in a confidential
relationship with the owner and driver. Answer C is incorrect because the conference involved a discussion of
the facts of the collision and the owner's insurance, which was confidential information. The mere fact that it
may be discussed later at trial does not mean the communications were not confidential. Answer D is incorrect
because, with the driver in the room during the joint conference with their attorney, the owner had already
waived confidentiality as to the driver. Since the owner's admissions in the conference were made in the
presence of the driver, there was no attorney-client privilege as to the driver's introduction of those statements
into evidence.

Question 255 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

The driver of a car and three passengers were injured when their car was struck by a truck owned by
Mammoth Corporation and driven by a Mammoth employee. A second Mammoth employee was riding in the
truck. The issues in this case include the negligence of the Mammoth employee in driving too fast and failing to
wear glasses, and the negligence of the driver of the car in failing to yield the right of way. 

The car driver's counsel proffers evidence showing that shortly after the accident, Mammoth Corporation put a
speed governor in the truck involved in the accident. The judge should rule the proffered evidence 

A: admissible as an admission of a party.
B: admissible as res gestae.
C: inadmissible for public policy reasons.
D: inadmissible, because it would lead to the drawing of an inference on an inference.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Placing a speed governor in the truck is the taking of a subsequent remedial measure
to avoid future accidents. It is in favor of public policy to encourage the taking of remedial measures,
regardless of the actual fault involved in the initial accident. Evidence of taking such remedial measures, if
introduced to show negligence or culpable conduct, should be ruled inadmissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because placing a speed governor in the vehicle does not necessarily constitute an
admission of fault in this case, and because evidence of subsequent remedial measures is inadmissible
pursuant to public policy. Answer B is incorrect because a subsequent addition of the speed governor is not
res gestae of the accident. Answer D is incorrect because "drawing an inference from an inference" is not a
legal standard to determine the admissibility of evidence and because the evidence is inadmissible as a
subsequent remedial measure.

Question 256 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

The driver of a car and three passengers were injured when their car was struck by a truck owned by
Mammoth Corporation and driven by a Mammoth employee. A second Mammoth employee was riding as a
passenger in the truck. The issues in this case include the negligence of the Mammoth employee in driving too
fast and failing to wear glasses, and the negligence of the driver of the car in failing to yield the right of way. 

The car driver's counsel seeks to introduce the written statement from the Mammoth truck's passenger that the
Mammoth employee had left his glasses (required by his operator's license) at the truck stop when they had
left five minutes before the accident. The judge should rule the statement admissible only if 

A: The driver of the car first proves that the truck passenger is an agent of Mammoth and that the statement
concerned a matter within the scope of his agency.
B: The driver of the car produces independent evidence that the Mammoth employee who was driving was not
wearing corrective lenses at the time of the accident.
C: The truck passenger is shown to be beyond the process of the court and unavailable to testify.
D: the statement was under oath in affidavit form.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The passenger's written statement is an out-of-court statement that is being offered
for the truth of the matter asserted, and would typically be considered inadmissible as hearsay. However, if the
passenger's statement is an admission by a party opponent, it would be admissible as nonhearsay under the
federal rules. Here, the passenger's statement would be admissible as a vicarious admission by a party
opponent if the passenger is an agent of Mammoth and the statement concerned a matter within the scope of
the agency. 

Answer B is incorrect because, even if there was independent evidence that the Mammoth employee was not
wearing corrective lenses at the time of the accident, that fact would not change the determination that the
passenger's written statement is inadmissible hearsay. Hearsay, even if corroborated, is still hearsay. Answer
C is incorrect because the passenger's availability to testify is irrelevant to the determination of whether the
written statement is inadmissible hearsay. Even if the passenger is unavailable, the statement would still be
inadmissible. Answer D is incorrect because affidavits are insufficient to be considered admissible as prior
testimony. Unless the driver of the car can show that the passenger's written hearsay statement amounted to
an admission by a party opponent, the statement should be held inadmissible.

Question 257 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

The driver of a car and three passengers were injured when their car was struck by a truck owned by
Mammoth Corporation and driven by a Mammoth employee. A second Mammoth employee was riding in the
truck. The issues in this case include the negligence of the Mammoth employee in driving too fast and failing to
wear glasses, and the negligence of the driver of a car in failing to yield the right of way. Mammoth's counsel
seeks to have a sheriff testify that while he was investigating the accident he was told by the driver of a car,
"This was probably our fault." The judge should rule the proffered evidence 

A: admissible as an admission of a party.
B: admissible, because it is a statement made to a police officer in the course of an official investigation.
C: inadmissible, because it is a mixed conclusion of law and fact.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The driver of the car's statement admitting fault is being introduced against him and is
admissible as an admission by a party opponent. Admissions by a party opponent are specifically defined as
nonhearsay under the federal rules. 

Answer B is incorrect because there is no exception to the hearsay rule for statements made to police officers
in the course of an official investigation. The driver of the car's statement is admissible because it is an
admission by a party opponent, not because he made it to a police officer. Answer C is incorrect because it
misstates the standard for the admission of hearsay statements. In addition, a party can admit to a matter of
law, and there is no rule concerning mixed issues of law and fact as it applies to hearsay. Answer D is
incorrect because the admission is specifically excluded from the definition of hearsay.

Question 272 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

The defendant is charged with the murder of the deceased. The prosecutor introduced testimony of a police
officer that the deceased told a priest, administering the last rites, "I was stabbed by [the defendant]. Since I
am dying, tell him I forgive him." Thereafter, the defendant's attorney offers the testimony of a friend that the
day before, when the deceased believed he would live, he stated he had been stabbed by an old enemy, not
the defendant. The testimony of the friend is 

A: admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.
B: admissible to impeach the dead declarant.
C: inadmissible, because it goes to the ultimate issue in the case.
D: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to any substantive issue in this case.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Statements that may otherwise be inadmissible as hearsay can be used to impeach
testimony already given from the declarant. Although the deceased's statement that an old enemy had stabbed
him would normally be inadmissible hearsay, it can be used to impeach his later statement that the defendant
was the one who stabbed him. Although the declarant is deceased, his admissible statement that the
defendant was the killer can still be impeached by one of the declarant's prior inconsistent statements. 

Answer A is incorrect because the deceased's statement to his friend that an old enemy had stabbed him, if it
were admitted for the truth of the matter asserted (that the old enemy did stab the deceased), then it would be
hearsay without any exception. The statement that the old enemy stabbed him was not a dying declaration,
and since it was hearsay, it can be used only to impeach his later statement and not as substantive evidence. 

Answer C is incorrect because the deceased's statement is factual evidence and not opinion evidence.
Opinion evidence that goes to the ultimate issue in the case may be inadmissible, but factual evidence, such
as who stabbed the victim, is clearly admissible. 

Answer D is incorrect because who actually stabbed the deceased, whether it is the defendant or the old
enemy, is one of the most substantive issues in the case, and the deceased's statement that the old enemy
had stabbed him is clearly relevant to determine who killed the deceased.

Question 278 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

In a trial between a farmer and an equestrian, an issue arose about the equestrian's ownership of a horse,
which had caused damage to the farmer's crops. 

The farmer offered to testify that he looked up the equestrian's telephone number in the directory, called that
number, and that a voice answered "This is [the equestrian] speaking." At this the farmer asked, "Was that
your horse that tramped across my cornfield this afternoon?" The voice replied "Yes." The judge should rule
the testimony 

A: admissible, because the answering speaker's identification of himself, together with the usual accuracy of
the telephone directory and transmission system, furnishes sufficient authentication.
B: admissible, because judicial notice may be taken of the accuracy of telephone directories.
C: inadmissible because the farmer did not testify that he was familiar with the equestrian's voice and that it
was in fact the equestrian to whom he spoke.
D: inadmissible because the equestrian was not first asked whether or not the conversation took place and
has been given the opportunity to admit, deny, or explain.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The farmer's testimony regarding his use of the telephone directory for an outgoing
call, his use of the telephone system, and the speaker identifying himself as the equestrian, provides sufficient
authentication for the telephone call to allow its entry into evidence. 

Answer B is incorrect because judicial notice of the accuracy of telephone directories, by itself, would not
provide the proper authentication for the telephone call. Answer C is incorrect because identification of the
equestrian's voice is not the only way to authenticate the telephone call. Authentication can also be done in the
manner above; it is not necessary for the caller to be familiar with the voice of the speaker in all cases. Answer
D is incorrect because there is no requirement that the equestrian has to be questioned about the call before
testimony regarding it can be introduced. If the telephone conversation is properly authenticated, it can be
admitted into evidence, regardless of whether the equestrian is questioned about it or not.

Question 279 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

In a trial between a farmer and an equestrian, an issue arose about the equestrian's ownership of a horse,
which had caused damage to the farmer's crops. The farmer testified that the photograph was taken within a
week after the alleged occurrence, and fairly and accurately portrays the condition of the cornfield after the
damage was done.  

The farmer seeks to introduce in evidence a photograph of his cornfield in order to depict the nature and extent
of the damage done. The judge should rule the photograph 

A: admissible because the farmer testifies that it fairly and accurately portrays the condition of the cornfield
after the damage was done.
B: admissible because the farmer testifies that the photograph was taken within a week after the alleged
occurrence.
C: inadmissible because the farmer failed to call the photographer to testify concerning the circumstances
under which the photograph was taken.
D: inadmissible because it is possible to describe the damage to the cornfield through direct oral testimony.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. To authenticate a photograph in order to introduce it into evidence requires the
proponent to establish that the photograph fairly and accurately portrays the scene it represents. Because the
farmer testified that the photograph fairly and accurately portrays the condition of the cornfield after the
damage was done, it should be admitted into evidence. 

Answer B is incorrect because the proximity in time to the incident is not the determining factor in the
admissibility of a photograph. The determining factor is whether the photograph fairly and accurately depicts
the scene it represents. Answer C is incorrect because it is no longer necessary to show the circumstances
around the taking of the photograph before the photograph can be admitted into evidence. Answer D is
incorrect because testimony regarding what is in the photograph does not preclude the admission of the
photograph. If the photograph fairly and accurately depicts the nature and extent of damage done, the
photograph should be admitted into evidence.

Question 282 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sues a department store for personal injuries, alleging that while shopping she was knocked to the
floor by a merchandise cart being pushed by a stock clerk and her back was injured as a result. 

The stock clerk testified that the plaintiff fell near the cart but was not struck by it. Thirty minutes after the
plaintiff's fall, the stock clerk, in accordance with regular practice at the department store, had filled out a
printed form, "Employee's Report of Accident," in which he stated that the plaintiff had been leaning over to
spank her young child and in so doing had fallen near his cart. Counsel for the department store offers in
evidence the report, which had been given him by the stock clerk's supervisor. 

The judge should rule the report offered by the department store 

A: admissible as res gestae.
B: admissible as a business record.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because the stock clerk is available as a witness.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The stock clerk's written report is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for
the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff fell and was not hit by the cart. Thus, it is hearsay. The stock
clerk's written report does not fall within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule and is inadmissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because the report is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the plaintiff
fell on her own accord - and not to show any state of mind of the stock clerk. Answer B is incorrect because
the accident report is the type of business record that the department store keeps in the regular course of
business, but quotes the stock clerk's own statement about the accident. A business record that quotes parties
or witnesses is generally not within the exception because the person being quoted in the report is under no
duty to accurately convey information about the incident. Answer D is incorrect because the stock clerk's
availability as a witness is not the best choice for the rationale of the judge when ruling on the admissibility of
the report. Further, whether the stock clerk is available or not, the report is still hearsay and inadmissible.

Question 306 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant, who was charged with the crime of assaulting the plaintiff, admitted striking the plaintiff but
claimed to have acted in self-defense when he was attacked by the plaintiff, who was drunk and belligerent
after a football game. 

The defendant's friend was called to testify that the plaintiff had a reputation among the people with whom he
lived and worked for law-breaking and frequently engaging in brawls. The trial judge should rule the testimony 

A: admissible to support the defendant's theory of self-defense, touching on whether the defendant or the
plaintiff was the aggressor.
B: inadmissible because the friend did not testify as to specific acts of misconduct on the plaintiff's part of
which the friend has personal knowledge.
C: inadmissible on the question of the defendant's guilt because the defendant, not the plaintiff, is on trial.
D: inadmissible, because the friend failed to lay a proper foundation.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Evidence of a relevant, specific trait of character of the alleged victim can be offered
by the accused to attempt to show that the victim was the aggressor in this case. The defendant's friend's
testimony that the plaintiff had a reputation for a specific, relevant trait, in this case a reputation for
law-breaking and violence, is admissible to support the defendant's theory of self defense by showing that the
plaintiff was the aggressor. 

Answer B is incorrect because the defendant's friend does not need to testify to specific acts of misconduct by
the plaintiff, but rather can testify to the plaintiff's reputation in the community for violence. Answer C is
incorrect because the defendant has raised the issue of self-defense, and the defendant's friend's testimony is
allowed to help prove that defense through reputation evidence of the alleged victim. Answer D is incorrect
because the defendant's friend can testify as to things in his personal knowledge, including the plaintiff's
reputation.

Question 320 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

The driver of an automobile ran into and injured a pedestrian. With the driver in his car were his wife and
another passenger. A passerby saw the accident and called the police department, which sent a sheriff to
investigate. 

All of these people were available as potential witnesses in the case brought by the pedestrian against the
driver. The pedestrian alleges that the driver, while drunk, struck the pedestrian who was in a duly marked
crosswalk. 

The pedestrian's counsel wishes to prove that after the pedestrian filed suit, the driver went to the pedestrian's
residence and offered $1,000 to settle the pedestrian's claim. The trial judge should rule this evidence  

A: admissible as an admission of a party.
B: admissible as an admission to show the driver's liability, provided the court gives a cautionary instruction
that the statement should not be considered as bearing on the issue of damages.
C: inadmissible since it is not relevant either to the question of liability or the question of damages.
D: inadmissible, because even though relevant and an admission, the policy of the law is to encourage
settlement negotiations.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. For public policy reasons, settlement offers and the conduct or statements
accompanying such offers are not admissible. Normally, for the exclusion to apply there must be an implied or
express indication that a claim will be made, and the claim must be disputed as to liability or amount. If there is
not, then an admission of fact is usually not considered part of a settlement negotiation and will be admissible
as an admission. Here, a claim has clearly been made. The statement by the plaintiff is an offer to settle, and
at the time of the statement liability was still in dispute. Therefore, the defendant's offer to settle for $1,000
would be inadmissible.  

Answer A is incorrect because, although an offer to settle may include an admission, the offer is still not
admissible in court. Answer B is incorrect because it is a misstatement of the applicable law and ignores the
public policy and rule against admitting settlement offers into evidence. Answer C is incorrect because an offer
to settle could be relevant to the question of liability. The offer to settle is inadmissible, not because it is
irrelevant, but because public policy is to encourage the settlement of claims.

Question 321 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

The driver of an automobile ran into and injured a pedestrian. With the driver in his car were his wife and
another passenger. A passerby saw the accident and called the police department, which sent a sheriff to
investigate. 

All of these people were available as potential witnesses in the case brought by the pedestrian against the
driver. The pedestrian alleges that the driver, while drunk, struck the pedestrian who was in a duly marked
crosswalk. 

The pedestrian's counsel wants to have the sheriff testify to the following statement made to him by the
passenger, out of the presence of the driver: "We were returning from a party at which we had all been
drinking." The trial judge should rule this testimony 

A: admissible as an admission of a party.
B: admissible as a declaration against interest.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because it would lead the court into nonessential side issues.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The passenger's statement is an out of court declaration that is being offered for the
truth of the matter asserted - that the driver had been drinking. As such, it is hearsay and inadmissible
because it does not meet the criteria for any exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer A is incorrect because the passenger is not a party to the suit and his statement cannot be attributed
to the driver. He was not an agent or a co-conspirator, nor was his statement adopted by the driver, so it is not
an admission by a party opponent. Answer B is incorrect because the passenger's admission that he had been
drinking had no civil or criminal liability for him and was not so far contrary to his pecuniary or proprietary
interests that no reasonable person would have made the statement had it not been true. Answer D is
incorrect because the statement, although hearsay, is relevant to prove that the driver had been drinking when
the accident occurred. The statement is highly relevant and should not be suppressed solely because it would
lead to nonessential side issues. The statement, however, is inadmissible because it is hearsay, not within any
exception.

Question 346 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant was indicted for the murder of the victim by poison. At trial, the prosecutor calls the county
coroner, who is a board-certified pathologist, to testify that, in accord with good practice in her specialty, she
has studied microphotographic slides, made under her supervision by medical assistants, of tissue taken from
the victim's corpse and that it is the coroner's opinion, based on that study, that the victim died of poisoning.
The slides have not been offered in evidence. 

The coroner's opinion should be 

A: excluded, because the cause of death is a critical issue to be decided by the trier of fact.
B: excluded, because her opinion is based on facts not in evidence.
C: admitted, because the coroner followed accepted medical practice in arriving at her opinion.
D: admitted, because her opinion is based on matters observed pursuant to a duty imposed by law.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The coroner's testimony that, in her opinion, the victim died from poisoning, should be
admitted as expert testimony. Because the coroner has specialized knowledge that will assist the trier of fact,
and she is state-certified and qualified to render an opinion, her testimony should be admitted. The coroner's
testimony was the product of reliable principles and methods, and she followed the accepted medical practice
in arriving at her opinion. 

Answer A is incorrect because the cause of death, while a critical issue, is not the ultimate issue of fact that
would encroach on the province of the jury. The coroner would not testify that the defendant poisoned the
victim; her testimony would be that the victim died of poisoning, a perfectly proper issue to be handled by
expert testimony. Answer B is incorrect because an expert can rely on facts, or in this case, slides, that are not
introduced into evidence, in forming her opinion as to the cause of death. The slides do not need to be
introduced into evidence before the coroner would be allowed to testify as to her opinion. Answer D is incorrect
because it is the wrong standard for determining the issue of admissibility of expert testimony. The
admissibility of the coroner's testimony does not rest on whether the matters observed were pursuant to a duty
imposed by law.

Question 347 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

At the trial of a defendant for a murder that occurred in a city, the prosecution called a witness who testified
that she saw the defendant kill the victim. The defendant believed that the witness was 600 miles away in a
small town, engaged in the illegal sale of narcotics, on the day in question. On cross-examination by the
defendant, the witness was asked whether she had in fact sold narcotics in the small town on that date. The
witness refused to answer on the ground of self-incrimination. 

The judge, over the prosecutor's objection, ordered that if the witness did not testify, her direct testimony
should be stricken. The order to testify or have the testimony stricken can best be supported on the basis that 

A: The witness had not been charged with any crime and, thus, could claim no privilege against
self-incrimination.
B: The witness's proper invocation of the privilege prevented adequate cross-examination.
C: the public interest in allowing an accused to defend himself or herself outweighs the interest of a non-party
witness in the privilege.
D: the trial record, independent of testimony, does not establish that the witness' answer could incriminate her.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The witness, had she answered the cross-examination question, would have
incriminated herself in criminal wrongdoing and subjected herself to possible criminal sanctions. By refusing to
answer the question, the witness properly invoked her rights under the Fifth Amendment against
self-incrimination, and she cannot be forced to answer the question. Since her refusal to testify was proper, the
court can find that there was no meaningful cross-examination possible and could order that her testimony
from direct examination be stricken. 

Answer A is incorrect because the witness, by admitting to the sale of narcotics, could be charged with that
crime. The witness cannot be forced to incriminate herself. Answer C is incorrect because there is no
balancing test to determine the propriety of an invocation of the witness's Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination. The witness cannot be ordered to testify on the basis that her testimony is more important
than her privilege against self-incrimination. However, the court can order her to testify, but if she still refuses,
can order her prior testimony on direct stricken. Answer D is incorrect because the witness's answer could
clearly incriminate her. If she answers the question affirmatively, she has admitted to committing the crime of
the sale of narcotics. The risk of the witness incriminating herself is sufficient for her invocation of her privilege
against self-incrimination.

Question 353 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

Cars driven by the plaintiff and the defendant collided, and the defendant was charged with driving while
intoxicated in connection with the accident. She pleaded guilty and was merely fined, although under the
statute the court could have sentenced her to two years in prison. 

Thereafter, the plaintiff, alleging that the defendant's intoxication had caused the collision, sued the defendant
for damages. At trial, the plaintiff offers the properly authenticated record of the defendant's conviction. The
record should be 

A: admitted as proof of the defendant's character.
B: admitted as proof of the defendant's intoxication.
C: excluded, because the conviction was not the result of a trial.
D: excluded, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The defendant's plea of guilty to driving while intoxicated is an admission that she
was, in fact, intoxicated when the accident occurred. As an admission, the record of the defendant's conviction
can be admitted as proof of the defendant's intoxication. Answer A is incorrect because a prior conviction for
driving while intoxicated is inadmissible to prove character. Answer C is incorrect because the defendant did
not need to be tried for the charge before the conviction can be used as an admission. Her plea of guilty to the
charge is an admission against a party opponent and can be used against her in the civil case. Answer D is
incorrect because the plea of guilty is an admission by a party opponent, which is specifically defined as
non-hearsay.

Question 354 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for damages for injuries that the plaintiff incurred when a badly rotted limb fell from
a curbside tree in front of the defendant's home and hit the plaintiff. The defendant claimed that the tree was
on city property and thus was the responsibility of the city. At trial, the plaintiff offered testimony that a week
after the accident, the defendant had cut the tree down with a chainsaw. The offered evidence is 

A: inadmissible, because there is a policy to encourage safety precautions.
B: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the condition of the tree at the time of the accident.
C: admissible to show the tree was on the defendant's property.
D: admissible to show that tree was in a rotted condition.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Subsequent remedial measures, including the removal of a tree, are generally
inadmissible to show negligence. However, they can be introduced into evidence to prove ownership or control
over the property in question. The defendant's cutting down of the tree can be used at trial, not to prove
negligence, but to prove the defendant owned and had control over the tree. 

Answer A is incorrect because, even though subsequent remedial measures are generally inadmissible to
prove negligence, the defendant's cutting down of the tree is admissible to prove the tree was on the
defendant's property. Answer B is incorrect because the defendant's cutting down of the tree is relevant to the
main facts at issue - whose property the tree was on. Answer D is incorrect because the subsequent remedial
measure of chopping down the tree is admissible only to show ownership of the tree, not to show negligence
or that the tree was in a rotted condition.

Question 359 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

A building contractor sued a defendant for failure to pay on a small cost-plus construction contract. At trial, the
contractor, who personally supervised all of the work, seeks to testify to what he remembers about the amount
of pipe used, the number of workers used on the job, and the number of hours spent grading. 

The defendant objects on the ground that the contractor had routinely recorded these facts in notebooks which
are in the contractor's possession. 

The contractor's testimony is 

A: admissible as a report of regularly conducted business activity.
B: admissible as based on first-hand knowledge.
C: inadmissible, because it violates the best evidence rule.
D: inadmissible, because a summary of writings cannot be made unless the originals are available for
examination.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Witnesses are competent to testify as to items within their first-hand knowledge. The
contractor can testify to the amount of pipe, workers, and number of hours spent on the job because these
items are based on his first-hand knowledge. The fact that there may be other written evidence on this issue
does nothing to preclude the contractor from testifying to items within his first-hand knowledge. 

Answer A is incorrect because the contractor's testimony is not a report of regularly conducted business
activity; it is live testimony from a witness. Answer C is incorrect because the best evidence rule applies only to
writings, recordings, and photographs, and does not preclude the admission of testimony that is based on
first-hand knowledge. Answer D is incorrect because the contractor's testimony is not merely a summary of
writings. It is his own recollection of items within his first-hand knowledge, separate and apart from the
writings. The contractor's testimony is admissible.

Question 361 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A grand jury was investigating a bank robbery. The only information known to the prosecutor was a rumor that
the defendant might have been involved. The grand jury subpoenaed the defendant. He refused to answer
questions about the robbery and was granted use immunity. He then testified that he and his friend had robbed
the bank. The grand jury indicted both the defendant and his friend for the bank robbery. The prosecutor
permitted the friend to enter a plea to a lesser offense in exchange for the friend's agreement to testify against
the defendant. The prosecutor had no evidence as to the identity of the robbers except the testimony of the
friend and the defendant. 

At the defendant's trial, his objection to the friend's being permitted to testify should be 

A: sustained, because the prosecutor may not bargain away the rights of one codefendant in a deal with
another.
B: sustained, because the friend's testimony was acquired as a result of the defendant's grand jury testimony.
C: overruled, because the police suspected the defendant even before he testified in the grand jury hearing.
D: overruled, because a witness cannot be precluded from testifying if his testimony is given voluntarily.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Since the defendant's grand jury testimony was the only evidence garnered by the
police that led to the friend's testimony, having the friend testify at trial would violate the original grant of use
immunity to the defendant. The only evidence identifying the defendant as one of the bank robbers is the
testimony of the friend. The friend's testimony was only discovered as a result of the defendant's testimony at
the grand jury. Since the defendant had been granted immunity, any evidence that is found solely as a result of
the defendant's testimony is inadmissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because it misstates the standard to review the admissibility of the friend's testimony.
Answer C is incorrect because, although the police suspected the defendant, there was no evidence as to the
identity of the robbers until the defendant testified. The friend's testimony implicating the defendant was only
discovered as a direct result of the defendant's immunized grand jury testimony. Answer D is incorrect
because it is a misstatement of the law. A witness can be precluded from testifying if allowing the testimony
would violate one of the defendant's constitutional rights or a prior grant of immunity. The defendant's
testimony before the grand jury was obtained pursuant to a grant of use immunity, and the admission of any
evidence that is solely the result of that testimony is precluded. The defendant's objection to the friend's
testimony should be sustained.

Question 379 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

The defendant is tried on a charge of driving while intoxicated. When the defendant was booked at the police
station, a videotape was made that showed him unsteady, abusive, and speaking in a slurred manner. If the
prosecutor lays a foundation properly identifying the tape, should the court admit it in evidence and permit it to
be shown to the jury? 

A: Yes, because it is an admission.
B: Yes, because its value is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.
C: No, because the privilege against self-incrimination is applicable.
D: No, because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The videotape is relevant evidence on the issue of whether the defendant was
intoxicated, and it is more probative than prejudicial. If a proper foundation is laid, there is no reason to
exclude the videotape from evidence. 

Answer A is incorrect because the videotape is not hearsay. It is not an out-of-court statement being offered
for the truth of the matter asserted. In addition, a videotape is not an admission, it is evidence recounting the
events of the night in question. Answer C is incorrect because the privilege against self-incrimination does not
extend to physical reactions or statements made without a custodial interrogation. The defendant's unsteady
appearance, his abusive language, and his speaking in a slurred manner are not statements that would be
protected by his privilege against self-incrimination. Answer D is incorrect because it is inapplicable to the
issue in this question. Specific incidents of conduct regarding the underlying charge, in this case the
defendant's appearance and actions, can certainly be proven by the extrinsic evidence of the videotape. The
videotape, if a foundation is properly laid, is probative evidence that should be admitted into evidence and
shown to the jury.

Question 388 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

In a plaintiff's negligence action against a defendant arising out of a multiple-car collision, a witness testified for
the plaintiff that the defendant went through a red light. On cross-examination, the defendant seeks to question
the witness about her statement that the light was yellow, made in a deposition that the witness gave in a
separate action between a man and a woman. The transcript of the deposition is self-authenticating. 

On proper objection, the court should rule the inquiry 

A: admissible for impeachment only.
B: admissible as substantive evidence only.
C: admissible for impeachment and as substantive evidence.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Prior inconsistent statements given by a witness who is subject to cross examination
on the stand can be used both for impeachment and as substantive evidence if the prior statements were
given under oath and under penalty of perjury. Since the witness's testimony at the trial is inconsistent with her
sworn testimony at the deposition, the statement at the deposition is admissible to impeach the witness's
current testimony. The statement at the deposition is also admissible as substantive evidence to show the light
was yellow. 

Answer A is incorrect because the prior inconsistent statement can be used as substantive evidence, as well
as for impeachment. Answer B is incorrect because the prior inconsistent statement can be used as
impeachment of the witness's testimony at trial, in addition to being substantive evidence. Answer D is
incorrect because prior inconsistent statements, if they are given under oath and under penalty of perjury in a
deposition, are specifically excluded from the definition of hearsay.

Question 393 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for battery. At trial, the plaintiff's witness testified that the defendant had made an
unprovoked attack on the plaintiff. On cross-examination, the defendant asks the witness about a false claim
that the witness had once filed on an insurance policy. The question is 

A: proper, because the conduct involved untruthfulness.
B: improper because the conduct had not resulted in conviction of the witness.
C: improper, because the impeachment involved a specific instance of misconduct.
D: improper, because the claim form would be the best evidence.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, if probative of truthfulness or
untruthfulness, can be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness to show the witness's character trait of
untruthfulness. The witness's filing a false insurance claim involves untruthful conduct and, consequently, the
defendant should be allowed to ask the witness about it. 

Answer B is incorrect because there does not need to be a conviction for a crime before a witness can be
questioned about specific instances of untruthful conduct. Answer C is incorrect because specific instances of
conduct, if they are probative on the issue of the witness's truthfulness or untruthfulness, can be inquired into
on cross-examination. Answer D is incorrect because the best evidence rule applies only to writings,
recordings, and photographs and does not limit the use of testimony of a witness.

Question 412 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

In a plaintiff's personal injury action, a physician who had no previous knowledge of the matter sat in court and
heard all the evidence about the plaintiff's symptoms and conditions. 

The physician is called to give her opinion whether the plaintiff's injuries are permanent. May the physician so
testify? 

A: Yes, provided she first identifies the data on which her opinion is based.
B: Yes, because an expert may base her opinion on facts made known to her at the trial.
C: No, because she has no personal knowledge of the plaintiff's condition.
D: No, because permanence of injury is an issue to be decided by the jury.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. A witness, qualified to testify as an expert, is allowed to give an opinion based on the
facts or data in the particular case, and those facts or data can be made known to the expert at or before the
hearing or trial. There is no requirement that an expert hear the facts or evidence prior to the trial. The
physician should be allowed to testify. 

Answer A is incorrect because an expert is not required to fully identify all the data on which the opinion is
based before giving her opinion to the court. Answer C is incorrect because the physician does have personal
knowledge of the plaintiff's condition, albeit through the testimony and evidence presented in the courtroom.
The physician is not required to conduct a physical exam of the plaintiff before she will be allowed to testify as
to the extent of the plaintiff's injury. Answer D is incorrect because testimony in the form of an opinion,
otherwise admissible, is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of
fact.

Question 428 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

In a tort action, a witness testified against the defendant. The defendant then called a friend to the stand, who
testified that the witness had a bad reputation for veracity. The defendant then also called a second friend to
testify that the witness once perpetrated a hoax on the police. 

The second friend's testimony is 

A: admissible, because the hoax involves untruthfulness.
B: admissible, because the hoax resulted in conviction of the witness.
C: inadmissible, because it is merely cumulative impeachment.
D: inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a specific instance of misconduct.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. Specific instances of a witness's conduct may not be proven by extrinsic evidence
when they are being used to impeach the credibility of the witness. Offering testimony that the witness once
perpetrated a hoax on the police is attempting to prove specific incidents of misconduct with extrinsic
evidence, and is thus inadmissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because, even if the hoax involved untruthfulness, it cannot be proven with extrinsic
evidence in the absence of a conviction. It may be inquired into on cross-examination, but it cannot be
introduced into evidence by the testimony of another. Answer B is incorrect because even if the witness was
convicted for the hoax, there is no indication in the question that the conviction required proof of dishonesty or
a false statement. Answer C is incorrect because the testimony is not cumulative. The testimony is
inadmissible because it is an improper method of impeachment.

Question 439 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A defendant is being tried in federal court for criminal conspiracy with another man to violate a federal
narcotics law. At trial, the prosecutor calls the defendant's new wife and asks her to testify about a meeting
between the defendant and the other man that she observed before she married the defendant. 

Which of the following is the most accurate statement of the applicable rule concerning whether the
defendant's wife may testify? 

A: The choice belongs to the defendant's wife.
B: The choice is the defendant's.
C: The defendant's wife is permitted to testify only if both the wife and the defendant agree.
D: The defendant's wife is compelled to testify even if both the wife and the defendant object.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The proposed testimony of the defendant's wife would invoke the adverse spousal
privilege, a privilege that only exists in the wife's discretion. The witness spouse, in this case the defendant's
new wife, alone has a privilege to refuse to testify adversely against her husband, and she may be neither
compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying. The choice is hers. 

Answer B is incorrect because the adverse spousal privilege belongs to the defendant's wife, and the
determination of whether to testify or not is her decision to make. The defendant cannot prevent his wife from
testifying. Answer C is incorrect because, once again, the decision belongs to the defendant's wife and no one
else. The defendant does not need to agree before his wife, if she wishes, is allowed to testify. Answer D is
incorrect because the adverse spousal privilege still exists in federal court. If the defendant's wife wishes not to
testify against the defendant, she cannot be compelled to do so.

Question 444 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

In a civil suit by the plaintiff against the defendant, the defendant called a chemist as an expert witness and
asked him a number of questions about his education and experience in chemistry. Over the plaintiff's
objection that the witness was not shown to be qualified in chemistry, the trial court permitted the witness to
testify as to his opinion in response to a hypothetical question. 

On cross-examination, the plaintiff asked the witness if he had failed two chemistry courses while doing his
graduate work. The answer should be 

A: admitted, because it is relevant to the weight to be given to the witness' testimony.
B: admitted, because specific acts bearing on truthfulness may be inquired about on cross-examination.
C: excluded, because the court has determined that the witness is qualified to testify as an expert.
D: excluded, because the witness's character has not been put in issue.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Although the witness was permitted by the court to testify as to his opinion, the
plaintiff is permitted to challenge the witness's qualifications because the challenge is relevant to the weight
given to the witness's opinion. 

Answer B is incorrect because the witness's failure in chemistry class has absolutely no bearing on his
truthfulness or untruthfulness as a witness. Answer C is incorrect because, although the court has determined
that the witness is qualified to render an opinion, the plaintiff retains the right to question the witness regarding
his qualifications in an effort to question the weight the witness's testimony should be given by the fact-finder.
Answer D is incorrect because a failure in a chemistry class does not go to the witness's character trait for
truthfulness or untruthfulness. Since the question regarding the witness's failure in chemistry indicates the
weight his opinion should carry rather than his character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, the question is
proper, and the answer should be admitted.

Question 465 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

The defendant was prosecuted for bank robbery. At trial, the bank teller was unable to identify the defendant,
now bearded, as the bank robber. The prosecutor then showed the bank teller a group of photographs, and the
teller testified that she had previously told the prosecutor that the middle picture (concededly a picture of the
defendant before he grew a beard) was a picture of the bank robber. 

The bank teller's testimony is 

A: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.
B: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the defendant's right of confrontation.
C: admissible as prior identification by the witness.
D: admissible as past recollection recorded.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. A prior statement by a witness, if that witness is testifying and available for
cross-examination, is not hearsay and is admissible, if it is one of identification of a person made after
perceiving the person. The bank teller's prior identification of the defendant in a lineup is admissible as a prior
identification by the witness. 

Answer A is incorrect because a prior identification by a witness is specifically excluded from the definition of
hearsay. Answer B is incorrect because the witness has testified and will be available for cross-examination
about the prior identification and the lack of an in-court identification, so there is no violation of the defendant's
right to confrontation. Answer D is incorrect because a past recollection recorded would indicate the
introduction of a writing made at or near the time of the event. There is no mention of any writing in the fact
pattern, just the photographs.

Question 472 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with aggravated assault. At trial the defendant did not testify; however, he sought to
offer opinion evidence of his good character for truth and veracity. 

This testimony should be 

A: admitted, because a criminal defendant is entitled to offer evidence of his good character.
B: admitted, because a party's credibility is necessarily in issue.
C: excluded, because character is not admissible to prove conduct in conformity therewith.
D: excluded, because it is evidence of a trait not pertinent to the case.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. Evidence of a person's character or a trait of character is not admissible for the
purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except when the trait of character
offered by an accused is pertinent to the charge the accused is facing. The defendant's attempt to introduce
evidence of his good character for truth and veracity is inadmissible because truth and veracity is not a
pertinent trait in a aggravated assault case when the defendant is not testifying. 

Answer A is incorrect because a criminal defendant is entitled to offer evidence of his good character only if it
involves a pertinent trait to the underlying charge. Truthfulness has no relevance to a determination of whether
or not an aggravated assault occurred. Answer B is incorrect because the defendant's credibility, since he did
not testify, is not at issue. If the defendant had testified and been cross examined as to his reputation for
dishonesty, it may be admissible, but the defendant did not testify and his credibility is not at issue in the case.
Answer C is incorrect because it ignores the exception to the general rule that character evidence is not
admissible to prove conduct in conformity therewith. The exception is where a defendant is allowed to present
evidence as to pertinent traits of character in the case. Since the trait for honesty and veracity is irrelevant to
an aggravated assault charge, that evidence is inadmissible here.

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with aggravated assault. At trial the defendant did not testify; however, he sought to
offer opinion evidence of his good character for truth and veracity. 

This testimony should be 

A: admitted, because a criminal defendant is entitled to offer evidence of his good character.
B: admitted, because a party's credibility is necessarily in issue.
C: excluded, because character is not admissible to prove conduct in conformity therewith.
D: excluded, because it is evidence of a trait not pertinent to the case.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. Evidence of a person's character or a trait of character is not admissible for the
purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except when the trait of character
offered by an accused is pertinent to the charge the accused is facing. The defendant's attempt to introduce
evidence of his good character for truth and veracity is inadmissible because truth and veracity is not a
pertinent trait in a aggravated assault case when the defendant is not testifying. 

Answer A is incorrect because a criminal defendant is entitled to offer evidence of his good character only if it
involves a pertinent trait to the underlying charge. Truthfulness has no relevance to a determination of whether
or not an aggravated assault occurred. Answer B is incorrect because the defendant's credibility, since he did
not testify, is not at issue. If the defendant had testified and been cross examined as to his reputation for
dishonesty, it may be admissible, but the defendant did not testify and his credibility is not at issue in the case.
Answer C is incorrect because it ignores the exception to the general rule that character evidence is not
admissible to prove conduct in conformity therewith. The exception is where a defendant is allowed to present
evidence as to pertinent traits of character in the case. Since the trait for honesty and veracity is irrelevant to
an aggravated assault charge, that evidence is inadmissible here.

Question 485 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

An issue in a plaintiff's action against a defendant for causing the plaintiff's back injury was whether the
plaintiff's condition had resulted principally from a similar occurrence five years before, with which the
defendant had no connection. 

The plaintiff called his treating physician, who offered to testify that when she saw the plaintiff after the latest
occurrence, the plaintiff had told her that before the accident he had been working full time, without pain or
limitation of motion, in a job that involved lifting heavy boxes. 

The physician's testimony should be 

A: admitted, because it is a statement of the plaintiff's then existing physical condition.
B: admitted, because it is a statement made for purposes for medical diagnosis.
C: excluded, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.
D: excluded, because the plaintiff is available as a witness.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, and statements
describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general
character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment, are
an exception to the hearsay rule and are admissible. The plaintiff's statement to his treating physician,
although hearsay, described his medical history and the lack of any symptoms or pain, and would be
admissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because the plaintiff's statement regarding his lack of pain or limitation while working
was a statement of memory or belief. The plaintiff's statements were not describing his condition that day to
the physician but were rather a description of his physical condition in the past. Those statements are not
about his then existing physical condition and would not be admissible on that basis. Answer C is incorrect
because, although the statements are hearsay, they do fit the statement made for purposes of medical
diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule. Answer D is incorrect because the plaintiff's availability is immaterial
to the determination of whether these statements fit the medical diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule.

A plaintiff sued the defendant in an automobile collision case. At trial, the plaintiff wishes to show by extrinsic
evidence that the defendant's primary witness is also the defendant's partner in a gambling operation. 

This evidence is  

A: admissible as evidence of the witness's character.
B: admissible as evidence of the witness's possible bias in favor of the defendant.
C: inadmissible, because criminal conduct can be shown only by admission or record of conviction.
D: inadmissible, because bias must be shown on cross-examination and not by extrinsic evidence.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The evidence that the witness and the defendant are partners in a business operation
is relevant and admissible to show the witness's potential bias or motive to lie on the defendant's behalf.
Answer A is incorrect because the evidence is being presented to determine the witness's bias toward the
defendant, not to prove the witness has a bad character. In addition, specific instances of the conduct of a
witness, such as gambling operations, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' character for
truthfulness may not be proven by extrinsic evidence. Answer C is incorrect because criminal conduct does not
have to be shown only by admission or record of conviction, direct firsthand knowledge can also be used. In
addition, the evidence is admissible on the issue of the witness's potential bias and motive to lie for the
defendant. Answer D is incorrect because evidence of bias or motive to lie is not restricted to
cross-examination; extrinsic evidence of bias is admissible.

Question 513 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

An attorney sued a client for his fee, based on an agreed hourly rate. The client subpoenaed the attorney's
time records for the days on which he purported to have worked for the client, in order to show that the
attorney had billed an impossible number of hours to the client and others on those days. The client's
subpoena provided that any information concerning the matters handled for other clients be deleted or
masked. The attorney moved to quash the subpoena on the ground of attorney-client privilege. 

The subpoena should be 

A: upheld, because the information about hours billed is not within the privilege.
B: upheld, because an attorney has no right to invoke his clients' privilege without instruction from the clients.
C: quashed, because an attorney is entitled to a right of privacy for the work product in his files.
D: quashed, because no permission was obtained from the other clients to divulge information from their files.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The attorney-client privilege extends to confidential communications between an
attorney and client during a legal consultation. Information about hours billed, however, is not a confidential
communication and is not subject to the privilege. 

Answer B is incorrect because an attorney can invoke the right to the privilege without the knowledge of his
client, including cases where the client is deceased. Answer C is incorrect because the information being
sought, the number of hours billed, does not require the disclosure of any confidential or privileged information
and does not invade the work product of the attorney. Answer D is incorrect because, since there is no
attorney client privilege in billed hours information, there is no need to obtain permission from the other clients.

Question 518 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

In litigation over the estate of a decedent who died intestate, a woman, who is eighteen years old, claimed to
be the decedent's niece and entitled, therefore, to a share of his large estate. In support of her claim, the
woman offered in evidence a Bible, properly identified as having belonged to the decedent's family, in the front
of which was a list of family births, marriages, and deaths. The list recorded the woman's birth to the
decedent's oldest sister.  

To prove that the woman is the decedent's niece, the Bible listing is  

A: admissible as an ancient document.
B: admissible as a family record.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because there was no showing of firsthand knowledge by the one who wrote it.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Statements of fact concerning personal or family history contained in family Bibles,
genealogies, tombstones, etcetera, are admissible hearsay. The woman's Bible listing is a family history
contained in a family Bible and is thus admissible as a family record. 

Answer A is incorrect because there is no evidence that the statement in the Bible is over twenty years old, or
that the authenticity of the Bible and statement has been established. Answer C is incorrect because, although
it is hearsay, the Bible listing is admissible under the family record exception to the hearsay rule. Answer D is
incorrect because the family record exception does not require that the author have firsthand knowledge of the
birth.

Question 521 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

A businessowner used aluminum brackets in her business. On the telephone listed as hers in the telephone
book, the businessowner received a call in which the caller said, "This is [the defendant], the owner of a
hardware company. We have a special on aluminum brackets this week at 30 percent off." The businessowner
ordered brackets from the caller. When the brackets were never delivered, the businessowner sued the
defendant for breach of contract. 

At trial, the defendant, who denies having made the telephone call, objects to the businessowner's testimony
concerning it. When asked, the businessowner testifies that, aside from the telephone call, she had never
heard the defendant speak until she met him in the judge's chambers before the trial and that, in her opinion,
the voice on the telephone was the defendant's. 

The strongest argument for admission of the businessowner's testimony concerning the telephone call is that 

A: the call related to business reasonably transacted over the telephone.
B: the call was received at a number assigned to the businessowner by the telephone company.
C: after hearing the defendant speak in chambers, the businessowner recognized the defendant's voice as
that of the person on the telephone.
D: self-identification is sufficient authentication of a telephone call.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. An incoming telephone call can be authenticated by the identification of the voice,
whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording, or by opinion based
upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker. The best
argument the businessowner can make is that the telephone call is authenticated by her ability to testify that
she recognized the defendant's voice as that of the person on the telephone. 

Answer A is incorrect because it puts forth the standard for the authentication of outgoing telephone calls, not
incoming calls as is the call in this case. Outgoing telephone calls can be authenticated by evidence that a call
was made to the number assigned at the time by the telephone company to a particular person or business, if,
in the case of a business, the call was made to a place of business and the conversation related to business
reasonably transacted over the telephone. However, the call at issue in this case is an incoming call, which
requires opinion evidence as to the identification of the voice. Answer B is incorrect for the same reason, the
call was incoming and not outgoing. 

Answer D is incorrect because self-identification is only sufficient authentication for outgoing calls to a listed
number to a residential line. The businessowner's best argument for the admissibility of the call is her ability to
recognize the voice over the telephone as that of the defendant.

Question 528 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for slander, alleging that the defendant had publicly accused the plaintiff of being a
thief. In his answer, the defendant admitted making the accusation, but alleged that it was a true statement. 

At trial, the defendant offers evidence that the plaintiff stole a ring worth $10,000 from a jewelry store. 

Evidence concerning this theft should be 

A: admitted, because specific instances of conduct may be proved when character is directly in issue.
B: admitted, because the plaintiff's action constituted a felony.
C: excluded, because character must be shown by reputation or opinion.
D: excluded, because its relevance is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Because the defendant is asserting that his statement was true, it must be
determined whether or not the plaintiff is a thief. In cases in which character or a trait of character of a person
is an essential element, that element may be proven by specific instances of that person's conduct. Therefore,
evidence that the plaintiff stole a ring on a prior occasion should be admissible to prove the truth of the
defendant's statement. 

Answer B is incorrect because the fact that the crime is a felony is only important if it is used for impeachment.
In this case, the evidence that the plaintiff stole a ring is being used to prove the truth of an allegedly
slanderous statement and the plaintiff's character trait for thievery is an essential element of the defendant's
defense.  

Answer C is incorrect because, although character evidence is generally shown by reputation or opinion, in
cases where a character trait is essential to the defense of a claim, specific instances of conduct are
admissible. 

Answer D is incorrect because the issue of whether the plaintiff is a thief is an essential element of the defense
to a defamation charge. Therefore, the evidence that the plaintiff is a thief is highly probative and has very little
danger of unfair prejudice. Because the plaintiff's prior theft is an essential to the defense of the alleged
defamation, evidence of specific instances of conduct can be used to prove the existence of that character
trait.

Question 532 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for damages arising out of an automobile collision. At trial, the plaintiff called an
eyewitness to the collision. The plaintiff expected the eyewitness to testify that she had observed the
defendant's automobile for five seconds prior to the collision and estimated the defendant's speed at the time
of the collision to have been 50 miles per hour. Instead, the eyewitness testified that she estimated the
defendant's speed to have been 25 miles per hour. 

Without finally excusing the eyewitness as a witness, the plaintiff then called a police officer to testify that the
eyewitness had told him during his investigation at the accident scene that the defendant "was doing at least
50." 

The police officer's testimony is 

A: admissible as a present sense impression.
B: admissible to impeach the eye witness.
C: inadmissible, because the plaintiff may not impeach his own witness.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay, not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The police offcer's testimony is admissible only to impeach the testimony of the
eyewitness. Prior inconsistent statements, even if they are hearsay, can be used to impeach the testimony of a
witness. 

Answer A is incorrect because the eyewitness's statement to the police officer during the investigation was not
made at the same time, or immediately after, the eyewitness saw the accident. Her statement is not admissible
under the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule. Answer C is incorrect because a witness
can be impeached by any party, including the party that called the witness. Answer D is incorrect because, in
this case, the statement is being used to impeach the eyewitness's trial testimony that the defendant was
traveling at 25 miles per hour. The eyewitness's statement to the police officer cannot be used as substantive
evidence because it is hearsay not within any exception. However, it can be used to impeach eyewitness at
trial.

Question 540 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant is on trial for burglary. During cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor wants to inquire
about the defendant's earlier conviction for falsifying a credit application. 

Which of the following facts concerning the conviction would be the best reason for the trial court's refusing to
allow such examination?  

A: The defendant was released from prison 12 years ago.
B: The defendant was put on probation rather than imprisoned.
C: It was for a misdemeanor rather than a felony.
D: It is on appeal.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Evidence of a prior conviction may be used to impeach a witness if it is a crime of
dishonesty and less than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness
from the confinement imposed for that conviction. If the defendant was released from prison 12 years ago, the
conviction should not be used. Answer B is incorrect because the actual sentence imposed, whether probation
or prison, is irrelevant to determine the admissibility of the prior conviction. Answer C is incorrect because a
crime of dishonesty, as is the case with falsifying a credit application, can be used to impeach regardless of
whether it was a felony or a misdemeanor. Answer D is incorrect because a pending appeal does not render
evidence of a conviction inadmissible. The trial court's best reason for refusing to allow the prosecutor to
inquire about the prior conviction is that it is too remote to be admissible due to amount of time lapsed.

Question 547 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant was prosecuted for homicide. He testified that he shot in self-defense. In rebuttal, a police officer
testified that he came to the scene in response to a telephone call from the defendant. The police officer offers
to testify that he asked, "What is the problem here, sir?" and the defendant replied, "I was cleaning my gun and
it went off accidentally." 

The offered testimony is 

A: admissible as an excited utterance.
B: admissible to impeach the defendant and as evidence that he did not act in self-defense.
C: inadmissible, because of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.
D: inadmissible, because it tends to exculpate without corroboration.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The defendant's statement to police officer is admissible as impeachment to the
defendant's statement that he shot in self-defense. It is also admissible as substantive evidence that the
defendant did not act in self-defense under the admission by a party exception to the hearsay rule. A prior
inconsistent statement, in this case the original claim to the police officer that the shooting was an accident, is
admissible to impeach the defendant's trial testimony. In addition, his statement to the police officer is an
admission by a party opponent and thus specifically excluded from the definition of hearsay. 

Answer A is incorrect because there is no evidence that the defendant made the statement while under the
stress of excitement caused by a startling event or condition and because it ignores the fact that the statement
can be used for impeachment purposes. Answer C is incorrect because the defendant was not subject to
custodial interrogation when he volunteered his statement so the police officer was not required to give him
hisMiranda warnings. Preliminary investigative questions are permissible without having to Mirandize the
witness. Answer D is incorrect because the statement's tendency to exculpate without corroboration is not the
test to determine the admissibility of the statement.

Question 559 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued the defendant for personal injuries sustained when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff, a
pedestrian. Immediately after the accident, the defendant got out of his car, raced over to the plaintiff, and
said, "Don't worry, I'll pay your hospital bill." 

Assume that the defendant kept his promise to pay for the plaintiff's medical expenses. The plaintiff's
testimony concerning the defendant's statement is 

A: admissible, because it is an admission of liability by a party opponent.
B: admissible, because it is within the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.
C: inadmissible to prove liability, because it is an offer to pay medical expenses.
D: inadmissible, because the defendant kept his promise to pay the plaintiff's medical expenses.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. An offer to pay medical expenses is not admissible to prove liability for the injury due
to public policy concerns. Thus, the defendant's statement to the plaintiff that he would pay for the plaintiff's
hospital bill is inadmissible to prove liability. Answer A is incorrect because a naked offer to pay medical
expenses is not an admission. Furthermore, such an offer is specifically deemed inadmissible for public policy
purposes. Answer B is incorrect because even if the excited utterance exception applied, the statement would
still be inadmissible because it is an offer to pay medical expenses. Answer D is incorrect because whether or
not the defendant actually kept his promise to pay is irrelevant to the determination of whether the offer to pay
is admissible.

Question 565 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

In a civil action for personal injury, the plaintiff alleges that he was beaten up by the defendant during an
altercation in a crowded bar. The defendant's defense is that he was not the person who hit the plaintiff. To
corroborate his testimony about the cause of his injuries, the plaintiff seeks to introduce, through the hospital
records custodian, a notation in a regular medical record made by an emergency room doctor at the hospital
where the plaintiff was treated for his injuries. The notation is: "Patient says he was attacked by [the
defendant]." 

The notation is 

A: inadmissible, because the doctor who made the record is not available for cross-examination.
B: inadmissible as hearsay, not within any exception.
C: admissible as hearsay, within the exception for records of regularly conducted activity.
D: admissible as a statement made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The plaintiff's statement to the emergency room doctor that the defendant attacked
him is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted -- that the defendant
did attack the plaintiff. As such, it is hearsay and not admissible under any exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer A is incorrect because the doctor who made the notation does not need to be present at trial and
available for cross-examination before the report itself is admissible under the business record exception to the
hearsay rule. The custodian of the hospital records can properly authenticate the document and allow for its
admission. In addition, although the medical records may be admissible themselves, the plaintiff's statement to
the doctor constituted another level of hearsay, which would make the statement inadmissible. 

Answer C is incorrect because, although the notation from the doctor into the medical record meets the
exception for records of regularly conducted activities, the plaintiff's statement to the doctor about who the
attacker was is another level of hearsay that is inadmissible. 

Answer D is incorrect because the plaintiff's statement to the doctor identifying the defendant as the attacker
was not a statement made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. Not everything a patient states to
a doctor is admissible under this exception to the hearsay rule, and a statement identifying the assailant to the
doctor serves no reasonable purpose for diagnosis or treatment and is consequently inadmissible under that
exception.

Question 574 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

The defendant was tried for the homicide of a girl whose strangled body was found beside a remote logging
road with her hands taped together. After the defendant offered evidence of an alibi, the state calls a witness
to testify that the defendant had taped her hands and tried to strangle her in the same location two days before
the homicide but that she escaped. 

The evidence is 

A: admissible as tending to show that the defendant is the killer.
B: admissible as tending to show the defendant's violent nature.
C: inadmissible, because it is improper character evidence.
D: inadmissible, because it is unfairly prejudicial.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of
a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. However, evidence of other crimes can be admitted to
show opportunity, intent, preparation, or plan. The crime against the witness occurred at the same location,
involved the same method of restraint of the victim, used the same method to attempt to kill the victim, and
occurred only a few days earlier than the homicide. The witness's testimony would be admissible to prove the
defendant had the same opportunity, preparation, and plan in both cases, and could be used to prove that the
defendant is the killer. 

Answer B is incorrect because the witness's testimony cannot be used to show the defendant's violent nature,
or his acts in conformity therewith. The testimony can be used to show his plan, preparation, and opportunity
to commit the homicide, but cannot be used to show the defendant's bad character. Answer C is incorrect
because the witness's testimony is not being used to prove character, but is being used to prove the same
opportunity, preparation, and plan in both cases. Used for this purpose, the witness's testimony is admissible.
Answer D is incorrect because the witness's testimony is highly probative on the issue of the defendant's guilt,
and its probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect it may have.

Question 586 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

In a prosecution of the defendant for murder, the government seeks to introduce a properly authenticated note
written by the victim that reads: "[the defendant] did it." In laying the foundation for admitting the note as a
dying declaration, the prosecution offered an affidavit from the attending physician that the victim knew she
was about to die when she wrote the note. 

The admissibility of the note as a dying declaration is 

A: a preliminary fact question for the judge, and the judge must not consider the affidavit.
B: a preliminary fact question for the judge, and the judge may properly consider the affidavit.
C: a question of weight and credibility for the jury, and the jury must not consider the affidavit.
D: a question of weight and credibility for the jury, and the jury may properly consider the affidavit.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by
the court. In making its determination, the court is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect
to privileges. The admissibility of the note should be determined by the judge, and he is permitted to consider
the affidavit. Answer A is incorrect because the judge is permitted to consider the affidavit even if it were
considered hearsay. Answer C and D are incorrect because matters regarding the admissibility of evidence
are for the judge, and only the judge, to rule on.

Question 613 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

The plaintiff sued a police officer for false arrest. The police officer's defense was that, based on a description
he heard over the police radio, he reasonably believed the plaintiff was an armed robber. A police radio
dispatcher, reading from a note, had broadcast the description of an armed robber on which the police officer
claims to have relied. 

The defendant offers three item as evidence. First, the police officer's testimony relating the description he
heard. Second, the police dispatcher's testimony relating the description he read over the radio. Third, the note
containing the description the police dispatcher testifies he read over the radio. 

Which of the items are admissible on the issue of what description the police officer heard? 

A: Only the police officer's testimony relating the description he heard.
B: Only the police officer's testimony relating the description he heard and the note containing the description
the police dispatcher testifies he read over the radio.
C: Only the police dispatcher's testimony relating the description he read over the radio and the note
containing the description the police dispatcher testifies he read over the radio.
D: All three items offered by the defendant.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The main issue at trial is to make a determination of what the police officer heard
over the police radio. All three items of evidence the defendant is seeking to admit (the police officer's
testimony, the police dispatcher's testimony, and the note) are relevant and admissible to that issue. The
police officer can testify as to what he believed he heard. The police dispatcher can testify as to what he read
over the radio. The note the police dispatcher read from is admissible to show what the police officer heard.
They are all forms of relevant evidence to aid the fact finder in its determinations. None of these forms should
be considered hearsay, because they are not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted - what the armed
robber actually looked like - but rather to show their effect on the listener, the police officer. Additionally, the
police dispatcher's testimony, since it is not a document, is not subject to exclusion under the best evidence
rule. All three of these items of evidence are relevant, and there are no reasons for their exclusion from
evidence.

Question 637 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for copyright infringement for using in the defendant's book some slightly disguised
house plans on which the plaintiff held the copyright. The plaintiff is prepared to testify that he heard the
defendant's executive copyright assistant say that the defendant had obtained an advance copy of the plans
from the plaintiff's office manager. 

The plaintiff's testimony is 

A: admissible as reporting a statement of an employee of a party opponent.
B: admissible as a statement of a co-conspirator.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because there is no showing that the assistant was authorized to speak for the defendant.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. A statement made by a party's employee concerning a matter within the scope of the
employment, and made during the existence of the relationship, is excluded from the definition of hearsay as a
vicarious admission of a party opponent. Because the statement the plaintiff is seeking to testify about was
made by an executive assistant who was working on copyright matters, the statement is admissible. 

Answer B is incorrect because there is no evidence that the executive assistant was involved in any way in the
obtaining of the copy of the plans or in the alleged infringement, so the assistant should not be considered a
co-conspirator. In addition, the statement the assistant made was not made in furtherance of a conspiracy. The
statement is not admissible as a co-conspirator statement but rather as an admission by an employee of a
party opponent. Answer C is incorrect because admissions by a party opponent, or by a party opponent's
employee, are specifically excluded from the definition of hearsay. Answer D is incorrect because there is no
requirement that the employee whose statement is sought to be introduced must be authorized to speak for
the party. Because it was made by the defendant's employee and in the scope of employment, the statement
is not hearsay and is admissible against the defendant.

Question 643 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

The defendant, charged with armed robbery of a store, denied that he was the person who had robbed the
store. 

In presenting the state's case, the prosecutor seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had robbed two
other stores in the past year. 

This evidence is 

A: admissible, to prove a pertinent trait of the defendant's character and the defendant's action in conformity
therewith.
B: admissible, to prove the defendant's intent and identity.
C: inadmissible, because character must be proved by reputation or opinion and may not be proved by specific
acts.
D: inadmissible, because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of
an accused person in order to show action in conformity therewith. The prosecutor is seeking to introduce
evidence that the defendant robbed two other stores in order to prove that the defendant robbed this particular
store; this evidence is inadmissible. The probative value of the other robberies is substantially outweighed by
the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 

Answer A is incorrect because the other robberies do not prove any "pertinent trait" to an armed robbery
charge beyond being evidence that, since the defendant robbed two other stores, he must have robbed this
one. The rules of evidence specifically exclude the prior robberies from being used to show that the
defendant's present actions were in conformity with those prior robberies. 

Answer B is incorrect because, although evidence of other crimes may be admissible to show intent or identity,
these prior crimes are not being offered for those purposes. There are no facts to indicate that the prior
robberies are being used to prove anything other than that the defendant committed this particular robbery
because he committed two prior robberies; this is an impermissible use of evidence of other crimes. Unless
there are specific qualities present in the prior convictions that tie the prior crimes to the particular robbery that
the defendant is currently on trial for, the evidence of the prior crimes is inadmissible. 

Answer C is incorrect because specific acts, including prior crimes, can be used for some purposes; however,
they cannot be used to prove present action in conformity with the prior crimes.

Question 672 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

During litigation on a federal claim, a plaintiff had the burden of proving that a defendant received a notice. The
plaintiff relied on the presumption of receipt by offering evidence that the notice was addressed to the
defendant, properly stamped, and mailed. The defendant, on the other hand, testified that she never received
the notice. 

Which of the following is correct? 

A: The jury must find that the notice was received.
B: The jury may find that the notice was received.
C: The burden shifts to the defendant to persuade the jury of nonreceipt.
D: The jury must find that the notice was not received, because the presumption has been rebutted and there
is uncontradicted evidence of nonreceipt.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The jury may, but is not required to, find that the notice was received. The plaintiff's
presumption under the mail box rule, that a properly addressed, stamped and mailed notice reached its
destination, imposes on the party against whom it is directed (here, the defendant) the burden of presenting
evidence to rebut or meet the presumption. In response to the presumption under the mail box rule, the
defendant testified that she never received the notice. The jury is thus empowered to judge the credibility of
both sides and can, but is not required to, find that the notice was received. 

Answer A is incorrect because the plaintiff's presumption that notice was received was rebutted by the
defendant's testimony that she did not receive it. The jury is not required to find that the notice was received.
Answer C is incorrect because the burden of proof does not shift to the defendant; it remains throughout the
trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast (the plaintiff in this case). The defendant does not need to
persuade the jury of non-receipt. Answer D is incorrect because the rebuttal of a presumption does not require
a finding for the rebutting party. In addition, the evidence that the notice was not received was contradicted by
evidence of the properly mailed notice. The jury, as fact finder, may find the notice was received, but is not
required to.

Question 673 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

In a medical malpractice suit by a patient against his doctor, the patient seeks to introduce a properly
authenticated photocopy of the patient's hospital chart. The chart contained a notation made by a medical
resident that an aortic clamp had broken during the plaintiff's surgery. The resident made the notation in the
regular course of practice, but had no personal knowledge of the operation, and cannot remember which of the
operating physicians gave him the information. 

The document is 

A: admissible as a record of regularly conducted activity.
B: admissible as recorded recollection.
C: inadmissible as a violation of the best evidence rule.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay within hearsay.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The chart is admissible as a record of regularly conducted activity. The chart is a
record of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information
transmitted by, a person with knowledge, that was kept in the course of a regularly conducted business
activity. In addition, it was the regular practice of that business to making medical records in order to maintain
a memorandum, report, record or data compilation. Although the resident may not be able to recall which
physician gave him the information, the resident knew that the statement was made. Therefore, the document
is admissible. 

Answer B is incorrect because the medical record is not a recollection recorded, it is a record of regularly
conducted activity. See Rule 803(5). Additionally, the facts state that the patient wants to "introduce the
authenticated photocopy" into evidence. If the patient was using the copy to refresh the recollection of a
witness, it would be seen by the witness only, not by the jury, and would not need authentication or
introduction. 

Answer C is incorrect because, unless there is a genuine question as to the authenticity of the original, which
there is not in this case, a duplicate is acceptable as evidence. Answer D is incorrect because the records are
admissible under the regularly conducted business activity exception to the hearsay rule, which includes the
statements made within the document.

Question 679 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

At the defendant's trial for stealing an automobile, the defendant called a character witness who testified that
the defendant had an excellent reputation for honesty. In rebuttal, the prosecutor calls another witness to
testify that he recently saw the defendant cheat on a college examination. 

The prosecution witness's testimony should be 

A: admitted, because the defendant has "opened the door" to the prosecutor's proof of bad character
evidence.
B: admitted, because the cheating involves "dishonesty or false statement."
C: excluded, because it has no probative value on any issue in the case.
D: excluded, because the defendant's cheating can be inquired into only on cross-examination of the
defendant's witness.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is
admissible but not essential, such as in this case, proof of that trait of character may be made by testimony
regarding reputation or by testimony in the form of opinion. Specific instances of conduct can only be used on
cross-examination. Because the defendant's honesty is not an essential element of the charge, the prosecutor
cannot use specific incidents of conduct to show that the defendant is guilty. However, the prosecutor could
have inquired about relevant specific instances of misconduct on cross-examination of the defendant's
witness. Answer A is incorrect because, even though the "door" may have been opened regarding the
defendant's honesty, the prosecutor cannot use specific incidents of misconduct to rebut the character
evidence testimony given by the defendant's witness, except in cross-examination. 

Answer B is incorrect because cheating on a college exam is a specific instance of misconduct; it is not
reputation or character evidence. Although the cheating involved dishonesty or false statement, it was not a
prior conviction and cannot be used as evidence. Answer C is incorrect because, by calling the defendant's
witness to testify about the defendant's reputation for honesty, the defendant made his character relevant to
the case. Thus, a specific instance of dishonesty would certainly be probative on that issue. The evidence is
excluded however, not because it is irrelevant or non-probative, but because specific instances of dishonest
conduct cannot be used to show that the defendant is guilty.

Question 686 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for damages for back injuries received in a car wreck. The defendant disputed the
damages and sought to prove that the plaintiff's disability, if any, resulted from a childhood horseback riding
accident. The plaintiff admitted to the childhood accident but contended it had no lasting effect. 

The plaintiff calls an orthopedist who had never examined the plaintiff and poses to the physician a
hypothetical question as to the cause of the disability that omits any reference to the horseback riding
accident. The question was not provided to opposing counsel before trial. 

The best ground for objecting to this question would be that 

A: the physician lacked firsthand knowledge concerning the plaintiff's condition.
B: the hypothetical question omitted a clearly significant fact.
C: hypothetical questions are no longer permitted.
D: sufficient notice of the hypothetical question was not given to opposing counsel before trial.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Hypothetical questions that do not include all clearly significant facts at issue in a
case are irrelevant. Since the plaintiff omits any reference to the horseback riding accident, even though he
admitted it occurred, any response to the hypothetical by the physician will be irrelevant to the determination of
the cause of the injury. 

Answer A is incorrect because an expert is allowed to offer an opinion on a hypothetical question, even if the
expert had no firsthand knowledge of the plaintiff's condition. That hypothetical, however, must be relevant to
the issue in the case. Answer C is incorrect because hypothetical questions, as long as they are based on the
facts or data in the particular case, are still permitted. Answer D is incorrect because there is no notice
requirement that hypothetical questions must be provided to opposing counsel before trial. The best ground for
objecting to the plaintiff's hypothetical question is that it omitted a clearly significant fact in asking for the
opinion.

Question 687 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant was prosecuted for the murder of a victim, whose body was found one morning in the street near
the defendant's house. The state calls a witness, a neighbor, to testify that during the night before the body
was found he heard the defendant's wife scream, "You killed him! You killed him!" 

The witness' testimony is 

A: admissible as a report of a statement of belief.
B: admissible as a report of an excited utterance.
C: inadmissible, because it reports a privileged spousal communication.
D: inadmissible on spousal immunity grounds, but only if the wife objects.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The defendant's wife's statement is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for
the truth of the matter asserted - that the defendant killed the victim - so it is hearsay. However, the statement
related to a startling event or condition made while the wife was under the stress of excitement caused by the
event or condition, and is thus admissible as an excited utterance. Therefore, the witness's testimony is
admissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because there is no statement of belief exception to the hearsay rule that applies to the
wife's statement. In addition, the statement is clearly being offered for the truth of the matter asserted (that the
defendant did kill the victim) and is not merely being offered to show the wife's belief. Answer C is incorrect
because the wife's statement is not a privileged communication. It was not confidential and was said loudly
enough that the neighbor heard it. Non-confidential statements are not covered by any form of spousal
privilege. Answer D is incorrect because, although spousal immunity may allow a wife not to testify against her
husband, it does not extend to the witness's testimony regarding what he overheard the wife say. The witness
is the person testifying, not the defendant's wife, so even if the defendant's wife objects, the witness can still
testify about what he heard.

Question 693 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant was prosecuted for sexually abusing his 13-year-old stepdaughter. The stepdaughter testified to
the defendant's conduct. On cross-examination, defense counsel asks the stepdaughter, "Isn't it true that
shortly before you complained that your stepfather abused you, he punished you for maliciously ruining some
of his phonograph records?" 

The question is 

A: proper, because it relates to a possible motive for the stepdaughter to falsely accuse the defendant.
B: proper, because the stepdaughter's misconduct is relevant to her character for veracity.
C: improper, because the incident had nothing to do with the stepdaughter's truthfulness.
D: improper, because it falls outside the scope of direct examination.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. A witness may be properly questioned about any bias or motive to lie the witness may
have. The defendant's counsel is permitted to inquire into whether the stepdaughter may have a bias or motive
to lie about the abuse since the defendant had punished her shortly before the complaint of the abuse. 

Answer B is incorrect because the stepdaughter's misconduct is actually irrelevant to her character for
veracity. Ruining phonograph records has nothing to do with the stepdaughter's character for truthfulness or
her credibility. Answer C is incorrect because, although the incident had nothing to do with the stepdaughter's
character for truthfulness, the question is still proper to show that the stepdaughter may have a bias against
the defendant or a motive to lie. Answer D is incorrect because a witness's bias or motive to lie can be inquired
into upon during cross-examination, even if the direct examination did not deal with the incident.
Cross-examination into matters affecting the credibility of the witness is proper.

Question 743 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sues a defendant for breach of a promise made in a letter allegedly written by the defendant to the
plaintiff. The defendant denies writing the letter. 

Which of the following would NOT be a sufficient basis for admitting the letter into evidence? 

A: Testimony by the plaintiff that she is familiar with the defendant's signature and recognizes it on the letter.
B: Comparison by the trier of fact of the letter with an admitted signature of the defendant.
C: Opinion testimony of a nonexpert witness based upon a familiarity acquired in order to authenticate the
signature.
D: Evidence that the letter was written in response to one written by the plaintiff to the defendant.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Although a lay witness is allowed to offer an opinion to identify and authenticate
handwriting, to do so, the witness's familiarity with the handwriting must have not been acquired for purposes
of the litigation. A non-expert who familiarized himself with the defendant's writing for the purpose of
authenticating it at trial was acting in preparation for trial, and is not allowed, under the rules of evidence, to
authenticate the letter. 

Answer A is incorrect because a letter can be authenticated by testimony of a witness that is familiar with the
signature and can identify it on the letter. Answer B is incorrect because a writing can be authenticated by a
comparison by the trier of fact with specimens which have been authenticated. Answer D is incorrect because
a writing can be authenticated by evidence that the writing was done in response to another writing from the
same parties.

Question 752 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

In the prosecution of a defendant for murdering a victim, the defendant testified that the killing had occurred in
self-defense when the victim tried to shoot him. In rebuttal, the prosecution seeks to call a witness, the victim's
father, to testify that the day before the killing, the victim told her father that she loved the defendant so much
she could never hurt him. 

The witness's testimony is 

A: admissible within the hearsay exception for statements of the declarant's then existing state of mind.
B: admissible, because the victim is unavailable as a witness.
C: inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because the victim's character is not at issue.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The victim's statement to her father that she loved the defendant and could never hurt
him is admissible as a statement of a then-existing mental or emotional condition. The witness's testimony is
being introduced to show the victim's existing emotional and mental state when she made the statement, and
is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer B is incorrect because, for the purposes of the then-existing mental or emotional condition exception to
the hearsay rule, it is irrelevant whether the declarant is available or not. Answer C is incorrect because,
although the statement may be hearsay, it is admissible under the then-existing emotional state exception to
the hearsay rule. Answer D is incorrect because the victim's character, as far as the self-defense claim goes, is
at issue in the case. In addition, the statement itself goes to the victim's state of mind when the statement was
made and not to her general character for violence or non-violence.

Question 764 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant is on trial for arson. In its case in chief, the prosecution offers evidence that the defendant had
secretly obtained duplicate insurance from two companies on the property that burned and that the defendant
had threatened to kill his ex-wife if she testified for the prosecution. 

The court should admit evidence of 

A: The defendant's obtaining duplicate insurance only.
B: The defendant's threatening to kill his ex-wife only.
C: Both the defendant's obtaining duplicate insurance and threatening to kill his ex-wife.
D: Neither the defendant's obtaining duplicate insurance nor threatening to kill his ex-wife.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Evidence of other crimes or acts are not admissible to prove the character of a
person in order to show action in conformity therewith. Such evidence may, however, be admissible for other
purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of
mistake or accident. The fact that the defendant had obtained duplicate insurance of the burned property is
relevant because it shows the defendant's motive for committing the arson. Any minor prejudicial effect of the
evidence of duplicate insurance would be outweighed by the probative value of the evidence. The defendant's
threat to kill his ex-wife if she testifies is also relevant, admissible evidence. The threat to kill his wife is being
offered as proof of the defendant's plan and knowledge, and his consciousness of his guilt and his attempts to
stop the introduction of evidence against him. Both the defendant's obtaining duplicate insurance and
threatening to kill his ex-wife are admissible into evidence. Answers A, B, and D are incorrect because both
the duplicate insurance and the threat to kill his ex-wife are admissible.

Question 768 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

Roberta Monk, a famous author, had a life insurance policy with an insurance company. Her son was the
beneficiary. The author disappeared from her residence in the city of Metropolis two years ago and has not
been seen since. On the day that Roberta disappeared, Sky Airlines Flight 22 left Metropolis for Rio de Janeiro
and vanished; the plane's passenger list included a Roberta Rector. 

The son is now suing the insurance company for the proceeds of his mother's policy. At trial, the son offers to
testify that his mother told him that she planned to write her next novel under the pen name of Roberta Rector. 

The son's testimony is 

A: admissible as circumstantial evidence that Roberta Monk was on the plane.
B: admissible as a party admission, because Roberta Monk and her son are in privity with each other.
C: inadmissible, because Roberta Monk has not been missing more than seven years.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The son's testimony concerning his mother's statement that she planned to write her
next novel under the pen name of Roberta Rector is not hearsay and is admissible as circumstantial evidence
that Roberta Monk was on the plane. Although it is an out-of-court statement, Roberta's statement is not being
offered for the truth of the matter asserted -- that Ms. Monk planned to write her next novel using the pen name
Roberta Rector. Instead, the statement is being offered to show that the person on the plane named Roberta
Rector was, in fact, Roberta Monk. Since the statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted,
it is admissible as relevant evidence. Answer B is incorrect because the statement is not an admission, and it
is not from a party to the suit. 

Answer C is incorrect because the length of time Roberta has been missing has no relevance to the
determination of the admissibility of the statement. Answer D is incorrect because the statement is not being
offered to prove Roberta Monk's next book was going to have the pen name Roberta Rector, so it is not being
offered for the truth of the matter asserted. The statement is not hearsay.

Question 773 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

Which of the following items of evidence is LEAST likely to be admitted without a supporting witness? 

A: In a libel action, a copy of a newspaper purporting to be published by the defendant newspaper publishing
company.
B: In a case involving contaminated food, a can label purporting to identify the canner as the defendant
company.
C: In a defamation case, a document purporting to be a memorandum from the defendant company president
to "All Personnel," printed on the defendant's letterhead.
D: In a case involving injury to a pedestrian, a pamphlet on stopping distances issued by the State Highway
Department.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Before an item of evidence can be admitted into evidence, it must be authenticated.
There are certain documents and types of documents that are self-authenticating. These self-authenticating
documents do not need a supporting witness before they can be admitted. A document purporting to be a
memo from a company, even if on letterhead, is not a self-authenticating document, and is least likely of the
examples to be admitted without a supporting witness. 

Answer A is incorrect because printed materials purporting to be newspapers or periodicals are
self-authenticating. Answer B is incorrect because inscriptions, tags, or labels purporting to have been affixed
in the course of business and indicating ownership, control, or origin are self-authenticating. Answer D is
incorrect because books, pamphlets, or other publications purporting to be issued by public authority are
self-authenticating. Only answer C is not listed in F.R.E. 902, which lists self-authenticating documents, and it
is the least likely to be admitted without a supporting witness.

Question 778 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

Under the rule allowing exclusion of relevant evidence because its probative value is substantially outweighed
by other considerations, which of the following is NOT to be considered? 

A: The jury may be confused about the appropriate application of the evidence to the issues of the case.
B: The evidence is likely to arouse unfair prejudice on the part of the jury.
C: The opponent is surprised by the evidence and not fairly prepared to meet it.
D: The trial will be extended and made cumbersome by hearing evidence of relatively trivial consequence.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed
by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, or undue delay, waste of time,
or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Only answer C does not deal with any of those
considerations, and instead deals with the exclusion of evidence based on potential discovery violations.
Answer A is incorrect because juror confusion of the issues is a consideration in determining whether to
exclude relevant evidence. Answer B is incorrect because unfair prejudice on the part of the jury is also a
consideration in determining whether to exclude relevant evidence. Answer D is incorrect because waste of
time and needless presentation of trivial evidence is also a consideration in determining whether to exclude
relevant evidence.

Question 788 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

In contract litigation between the plaintiff and the defendant, a fact of consequence to the determination of the
action is whether the plaintiff provided the defendant with a required notice at the defendant's branch office "in
the state capital." The plaintiff introduced evidence that he gave notice at the defendant's office in the city of
Capitan. Although Capitan is the state's capital, the plaintiff failed to offer proof of that fact. 

Which of the following statements is most clearly correct with respect to possible judicial notice of the fact that
Capitan is the state's capital? 

A: The court may take judicial notice even though the plaintiff does not request it.
B: The court may take judicial notice only if the plaintiff provides the court with an authenticated copy of the
statute that designates Capitan as the capital.
C: If the court takes judicial notice, the burden of persuasion on the issue of whether Capitan is the capital
shifts to the defendant.
D: If the court takes judicial notice, it should instruct the jury that it may, but is not required to, accept as
conclusive the fact that Capitan is the capital.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. A court may take judicial notice of a relevant fact whether a party requests it or not.
Answer B is incorrect because a court can take judicial notice of a fact that is not subject to reasonable
dispute, and the plaintiff would not have to provide any information to the court before it can take judicial
notice. Answer C is incorrect because there is no burden shifting in cases involving judicial notice. Answer D is
incorrect because, in civil cases, the court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any fact judicially
noticed. The jury is required to accept a judicially noticed fact as conclusive on the issue. Because the identity
of the capital of a state is a fact not subject to reasonable dispute, the judge can take judicial notice of it, even
if neither party requests it.

defendant later called a witness, who testified that the bystander's reputation for truthfulness was bad. 

On cross-examination of the witness, the plaintiff's counsel asks, "Isn't it a fact that when you bought your new
car last year, you made a false affidavit to escape paying the sales tax?" 

This question is 

A: proper, because it will indicate the witness's standard of judgment as to reputation for truthfulness.
B: proper, because it bears on the witness's credibility.
C: improper, because character cannot be proved by specific instances of conduct.
D: improper, because one cannot impeach an impeaching witness.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Specific instances of a witness's misconduct, for the purpose of attacking or
supporting the witness's character for truthfulness, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may,
however, if probative of the witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on
cross-examination of the witness. The witness's creation of a false affidavit is probative of his character for
truthfulness and bears on his credibility. The plaintiff's counsel's questioning of the witness is proper. Answer A
is incorrect because the question is admissible as to the witness's credibility and not to his standard for
judgment of reputations. Answer C is incorrect because a witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness
cannot be proven by extrinsic evidence of specific instances. However the instances can be asked about in
cross-examination. Answer D is incorrect because it is a misstatement of law. Any witness may be impeached.

Question 796 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

In the prosecution of a defendant for forgery, the defense objects to the testimony of a government expert on
the ground of inadequate qualifications. The government seeks to introduce a letter from the expert's former
criminology professor, stating that the expert is generally acknowledged in his field as well qualified. 

On the issue of the expert's qualifications, the letter may be considered by 

A: the jury, without regard to the hearsay rule.
B: the judge, without regard to the hearsay rule.
C: neither the judge nor the jury, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: both the judge and the jury, because the letter is not offered for a hearsay purpose.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness shall be
determined by the court. In making its determination, the court is not bound by the rules of evidence except
those with respect to privileges. The letter, although hearsay, may be considered by the judge in determining
whether the witness is qualified as an expert. 

Answer A is incorrect because the judge, not the jury, determines the qualifications of a person to be a
witness. Answer C is incorrect because the rules of evidence, including the rule against hearsay, do not apply
to the judge's making the initial determination whether the witness is qualified to testify as an expert. Answer D
is incorrect because the determination is to be made by the judge only, and because the letter should be used
outside the presence of the jury.

Question 807 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

In a federal court diversity action by a plaintiff against a defendant on an insurance claim, a question arose
whether the court should apply a presumption that, where both husband and wife were killed in a common
accident, the husband died last. 

Whether this presumption should be applied is to be determined according to 

A: traditional common law.
B: federal statutory law.
C: the law of the state whose substantive law is applied.
D: the federal common law.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. In civil actions and proceedings, whether a presumption should be applied is
determined in accordance with the state law whose substantive law is applied to the case. Answer A is
incorrect because the state whose substantive law is being applied in the case determines whether the
presumption should be applied. Answers B and D are incorrect for the same reason.

Question 826 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for libel. After the plaintiff testified that the defendant wrote to the plaintiff's
employer that the plaintiff was a thief, the defendant offers evidence that the plaintiff once stole money from a
former employer. 

The evidence of the plaintiff's prior theft is 

A: admissible, as substantive evidence to prove that the plaintiff is a thief.
B: admissible, but only to impeach the plaintiff's credibility.
C: inadmissible, because character may not be shown by specific instances of conduct.
D: inadmissible, because such evidence is more unfairly prejudicial than probative.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Because one of the main issues in the case is whether or not the plaintiff is a thief
(and consequently whether the defendant's letter to the employer was true), the plaintiff's character trait for
thievery is essential. In cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element,
proof may be made by showing specific instances of that person's conduct. Evidence that the plaintiff stole
money from a former employer on a prior occasion is admissible to prove that the plaintiff is a thief. 

Answer B is incorrect because the evidence of the plaintiff's prior theft can be used to prove the truth of the
statement that the plaintiff is a thief, as well as for impeachment of the plaintiff's testimony. Answer C is
incorrect because the evidence of the plaintiff's prior theft is not being used to show character but rather is
being used to provide a defense to the claim for libel. In addition, the evidence that the plaintiff stole money
demonstrates his character trait for thievery, which would be an essential element of the defendant's defense.
Answer D is incorrect because whether the plaintiff is indeed a thief is an essential issue in the case, and
evidence that the plaintiff stole money from his former employer is highly probative and has little danger of
unfair prejudice.

Question 837 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with possession of cocaine. At the defendant's trial, the prosecution established that,
when approached by police on a suburban residential street corner, the defendant dropped a plastic bag and
ran, and that when the police returned to the corner a few minutes later after catching the defendant, they
found a plastic bag containing white powder. The defendant objects to introduction of this bag (the contents of
which would later be established to be cocaine), citing lack of adequate identification. 

The objection should be 

A: overruled, because there is sufficient evidence to find that the bag was the one the defendant dropped.
B: overruled, because the objection should have been made on the basis of incomplete chain of custody.
C: sustained, because the defendant did not have possession of the bag at the time he was arrested.
D: sustained, unless the judge makes a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the bag was the one
dropped by the defendant.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to
admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its
proponent claims. By establishing that the defendant dropped a plastic bag, and that, after only a few minutes,
the police officers returned to the same spot and found a plastic bag, the prosecution has introduced sufficient
evidence for a finding that the bag was the one the defendant dropped. The objection should be overruled. 

Answer B is incorrect because the bag is admissible, and an objection on the basis of incomplete chain of
custody would be overruled. Answer C is incorrect because, although the defendant did not have possession
of the bag at the time he was caught, the police identified him with the bag just prior to his fleeing. There is
sufficient evidence to link the bag to the defendant and to provide sufficient identification and authenticity.
Answer D is incorrect because the judge does not have to make a finding by a preponderance of the evidence
that the bag was the one dropped by the defendant; the judge need only find that there was sufficient evidence
to support a finding that the plastic bag in question was the one the defendant was holding.

Question 839 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

A threatening telephone call that purports to be from a defendant to a witness is most likely to be admitted
against the defendant if 

A: the caller identified himself as the defendant.
B: the witness had previously given damaging testimony against the defendant in another lawsuit.
C: the witness had given his unlisted number only to the defendant and a few other persons.
D: the witness believes that the defendant is capable of making such threats.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition to admissibility is
satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims. By
severely limiting the number of people who knowingly could call and threaten the witness, there is sufficient
evidence to support a finding that the telephone call is what the witness claims it to be. 

Answer A is incorrect because self-identification on an incoming telephone call is insufficient evidence to allow
for the admission of the telephone call against the defendant. Answer B is incorrect because testimony
providing motive to the defendant, without more, will be insufficient to allow for the admission of the telephone
call against the defendant. Answer D is incorrect because the witness's belief that the defendant is capable of
making such threats is virtually irrelevant to the identification of the caller and the admissibility of the telephone
call. Severely limiting the number of possible callers would be the best method to support the introduction of
the telephone call.

Question 859 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

In a suit by a plaintiff against a defendant, the plaintiff sought to subpoena an audiotape on which the
defendant had narrated his version of the dispute for his attorney. Counsel for the defendant moves to quash
the subpoena on the ground of privilege. 

The audiotape is most likely to be subject to subpoena if 

A: the defendant played the audiotape for his father to get his reactions.
B: the lawsuit involved alleged criminal behavior by the defendant.
C: the defendant has been deposed and there is good reason to believe that the audiotape may contain
inconsistent statements.
D: the defendant is deceased and thus unavailable to give testimony in person.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The attorney-client privilege is broken if the communications involved are not
intended to be or do not remain confidential. If the defendant played the audiotape for his father to get his
reaction, the communication is no longer confidential and the attorney-client privilege will not apply. Answer B
is incorrect because, even if the lawsuit alleged criminal behavior by the defendant, the privilege remains in
effect. Only if the communication contains ongoing criminal activity or a plan to commit a future crime or fraud
will the crime-fraud exception break the attorney-client privilege. Answer C is incorrect because whether or not
the audiotape contains inconsistent statements is irrelevant to determining whether those statements are
protected under the attorney-client privilege. Answer D is incorrect because the attorney-client privilege
extends beyond the death of the client.

Question 863 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for injuries received when she fell down a stairway in the defendant's apartment
building. The plaintiff, a guest in the building, alleged that she caught the heel of her shoe in a tear in the stair
carpet. The plaintiff calls a tenant to testify that another resident had said to the the tenant a week before the
plaintiff's fall: "When I paid my rent this morning, I told the manager he had better fix that torn carpet." 

The resident's statement, reported by the tenant, is 

A: admissible, to prove that the carpet was defective.
B: admissible, to prove that the defendant had notice of the defect.
C: admissible, to prove both that the carpet was defective and that the defendant had notice of the defect.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The resident's statement is hearsay within hearsay. Therefore, it must have an
exception to each level of hearsay. The first level of hearsay, the resident's statement about what he told the
landlord, would be admissible to show knowledge. However, the second level of hearsay, the tenant's
statement about what the resident told him, does not meet the requirements of any exception to the hearsay
rule and thus his statement is inadmissible. 

Answer B is incorrect because although the resident's statement would be admissible for its effect on the
listener, the tenant's reporting of that statement is hearsay not within any exception. Answers A and C are
incorrect because not only is the tenant's reporting of that statement hearsay not within any exception, but the
resident's statement to the tenant is also inadmissible hearsay if it is being used as proof that the carpet was
defective.

Question 866 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant was prosecuted for bankruptcy fraud. The defendant's wife, now deceased, had testified
adversely to the defendant during earlier bankruptcy proceedings that involved similar issues. Although the
wife had been cross examined, no serious effort was made to challenge her credibility despite the availability
of significant impeachment information. At the fraud trial, the prosecutor offers into evidence the testimony
given by the defendant's wife at the bankruptcy proceeding. 

This evidence should be 

A: admitted, under the hearsay exception for former testimony.
B: admitted, because it is a statement by a person identified with a party.
C: excluded, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: excluded, because the defendant has the right to prevent use of his spouse's testimony against him in a
criminal case.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The defendant's wife's testimony at the prior hearing, if relevant to the bankruptcy
fraud case, is admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. Testimony given as a
witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is
now offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect
examination, is admissible if the declarant is unavailable. In this case, the wife is now deceased and
unavailable to testify. Although the testimony was in a separate proceeding, the defendant had the opportunity
and motive to cross examine his wife about the testimony, and the mere fact that he didn't use all he could
have on cross examination does not make the testimony inadmissible. Therefore, it is admissible under the
former testimony exception. Answer B is incorrect because the standard for admission of hearsay is not that it
was a statement by a person identified with a party. There is no evidence that the former testimony would be
an admission or that the wife's testimony could be imputed to the husband. Answer C is incorrect because the
statements are admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. Answer D is incorrect
because the defendant does not have the right to prevent the use of his spouse's testimony against him, and
even if he did, the confidentiality of the statements had already been breached when the wife first testified.

Question 871 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He had been stopped while
driving a car and several pounds of cocaine were found in the trunk. In his opening statement, the defendant's
counsel asserted that his client had no key to the trunk and no knowledge of its contents. The prosecutor
offers the state motor vehicle registration, shown to have been found in the glove compartment of the car,
listing the defendant as the owner. 

The registration should be 

A: admitted, as a statement against interest.
B: admitted, as evidence of the defendant's close connection with the car and, therefore, knowledge of its
contents.
C: excluded, unless authenticated by testimony of or certification by a state official charged with custody of
vehicle registration records.
D: excluded, as hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The state issued motor vehicle registration is admissible to show the vehicle was the
defendant's and for the inference that he knew what was in the trunk. State issued motor vehicle registrations
are self-authenticating documents that are admissible under the public records and records of regularly
conducted business exceptions to the hearsay rule. Answer A is incorrect because the vehicle registration is
not a statement made by the defendant; it is made by the state. In addition, it is not a statement against
interest. Answer C is incorrect because the motor vehicle registration is self-authenticating. Answer D is
incorrect because the registration meets the requirements for the public records exception to the hearsay rule.

Question 886 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for dissolution of their year-long partnership. One issue concerned the amount of
money the plaintiff had received in cash. It was customary for the defendant to give the plaintiff money from
the cash register as the plaintiff needed it for personal expenses. The plaintiff testified that, as he received
money, he jotted down the amounts in the partnership ledger. Although the defendant had access to the
ledger, he made no changes in it. The defendant seeks to testify to his memory of much larger amounts he
had given the plaintiff. 

The defendant's testimony is 

A: admissible, because it is based on the defendant's firsthand knowledge.
B: admissible, because the ledger entries offered by a party opponent opened the door.
C: inadmissible, because the ledger is the best evidence of the amounts the plaintiff received.
D: inadmissible, because the defendant's failure to challenge the accuracy of the ledger constituted an
adoptive admission.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The defendant is seeking to testify that he had provided larger amounts to the plaintiff
than was indicated in the ledger. That testimony is based on the defendant's firsthand knowledge; he was the
one who handed the plaintiff the money. The defendant can testify as to how much money was there, and his
testimony is admissible. 

Answer B is incorrect because the testimony is admissible as relevant, firsthand knowledge evidence, not
because the "door had been opened." Answer C is incorrect because the best evidence rule does not apply to
testimonial evidence in this case. Answer D is incorrect because there are no facts that support the idea that
the defendant failed to challenge the accuracy of the ledger or that he adopted it as the truth. The defendant
can certainly offer testimony on matters within his firsthand knowledge, and the mere fact that there may be
contradictory evidence in the ledger does not foreclose his testimony.

Question 890 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant is on trial for killing the victim. The prosecutor calls a witness to testify that after being shot, the
victim said, "The defendant did it." Before the testimony is given, the defendant's lawyer asks for a hearing on
whether the victim believed his death was imminent when he made the statement. 

Before permitting evidence of the dying declaration, the judge should hear evidence on the issue from 

A: both sides, with the jury not present, and decide whether the witness may testify to the victim's statement.
B: both sides, with the jury present, and decide whether the witness may testify to the victim's statement.
C: both sides, with the jury present, and allow the jury to determine whether the witness may testify to the
victim's statements.
D: the prosecutor only, with the jury not present, and if the judge believes a jury could reasonably find that the
victim knew he was dying, permit the witness to testify to the statement, with the defendant allowed to offer
evidence on the issue as a part of the defendant's case.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by
the court. Both sides are permitted to present evidence and argument about the admissibility of the evidence,
and the hearing should be conducted outside of the presence of the jury. Answer B is incorrect because, in
jury cases, evidentiary hearings shall be conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible
evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or
asking questions in the hearing of the jury. The jury should not be present for the evidentiary hearing. Answer
C is incorrect because the jury should not be present and the determination is to be done by the judge. Answer
D is incorrect because both sides, not just the proponent of the evidence, must be permitted to present
evidence and arguments about the admissibility of evidence. In addition, the standard the judge should use in
ruling on the admissibility in Answer D is incorrect.

Question 894 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A driver sued a factory for injuries suffered in the crash of the driver's dune buggy, allegedly caused by a
defective auto part manufactured by the factory. The factory claims that the part was a fraudulent imitation, not
produced by the factory. 

Which of the following is NOT admissible on the issue of whether the part was manufactured by the factory? 

A: The fact that the defective part bears the factory's insignia or trademark.
B: Testimony that the part was purchased from a parts house to which the factory regularly sold parts.
C: The part itself and a concededly genuine part manufactured by the factory (for the jury's comparison).
D: A judgment for another plaintiff against the factory in another case involving substantially similar facts.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. Since the issue in the case is very specific to the facts of the case, a judgment for
another plaintiff against the factory, even if the facts are substantially similar, is inadmissible in this case. It is
completely irrelevant to the determination of whether the driver's auto part was manufactured by the factory
that some other plaintiff in some other case obtained a judgment against the factory. 

Answer A is incorrect because the insignia or trademark is relevant, non-hearsay evidence that is
self-authenticating as an inscription, sign, or label purporting to have been affixed in the course of business
and indicating ownership, control, or origin. Answer B is incorrect because the testimony that the part was
purchased from a parts house to which the factory regularly sold parts is relevant, admissible evidence. While
certainly not dispositive, where the part was purchased is certainly evidence having a tendency to make the
existence of a fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable
than it would be without the evidence. Answer C is incorrect because identification of the object can be shown
through comparison by the trier of fact with specimens which have been authenticated.

Question 900 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A defendant was prosecuted in federal court for making threats against the President of the United States. The
defendant was a voluntary patient in a private psychiatric hospital and told a nurse, shortly before the
President came to town, that the defendant planned to shoot the President. The nurse reported the threat to
FBI agents. 

The defendant's motion to prevent the nurse's testifying is likely to be 

A: successful, because the statement was made in a medical setting.
B: successful, because the nurse violated a confidence in reporting the statement.
C: unsuccessful, because the statement was not within any privilege.
D: unsuccessful, because the defendant had not been committed involuntarily by court order.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Although federal courts do recognize a psychiatrist-patient privilege, the defendant's
statement to the nurse that he planned to shoot the President was not confidential and was not made to obtain
treatment. Therefore, the statement is unprivileged and the nurse should be allowed to testify about the
statement. 

Answer A is incorrect because, although the statement was made in a medical setting, the privilege only
covers confidential communications between a licensed psychotherapist and her patients in the course of
diagnosis or treatment. Not every statement in a medical setting is privileged, and the defendant's statement to
the nurse was not a confidential communication made in the course of diagnosis or treatment. Answer B is
incorrect because whether or not the statement was made in confidence is not the legal standard to determine
its admissibility. The statement was not subject to the privilege. Answer D is incorrect because whether the
defendant was there voluntarily or committed involuntarily has no relevance to the determination of whether
the privilege applies.

Question 913 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with murder, and a witness testified for the prosecution. On cross-examination of the
witness, the defendant seeks to elicit an admission that the witness was also charged with the same murder
and that the prosecutor told her, "If you testify against the defendant, we will drop the charges against you after
the conclusion of the defendant's trial." 

The evidence about the prosecutor's promise is 

A: admissible, as proper impeachment of the witness.
B: admissible, as an admission by an agent of a party-opponent.
C: inadmissible, because the law encourages plea-bargaining.
D: inadmissible, because the evidence is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The prosecutor's statement to the witness is not being offered for the truth of the
matter asserted -- that the state will drop the charges against the witness. Rather, it is being offered to show
the witness's bias and interest in the outcome of the case. If the witness believes that the state will drop the
charges against him, he clearly has a motive to give testimony that would curry favor with the state. Therefore,
he can be properly impeached with the prosecutor's promise to him. 

Answer B is incorrect because the prosecutor is not an agent of a party-opponent and because a plea offer is
not an admission. Answer C is incorrect because, although plea agreements are encouraged, plea offers by
the prosecution can still be used against a witness when it provides a motive for the witness to lie. Prior plea
bargaining is only inadmissible against the same defendant who was the party to the bargaining. Answer D is
incorrect because the prosecutor's statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, so it is
not hearsay.

Question 917 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for fraud. After verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant talked with a juror about the
trial. 

The defendant's motion for a new trial would be most likely granted if the juror is willing to testify that he voted
for the plaintiff because he 

A: misunderstood the judge's instructions concerning the standard of proof in a fraud case.
B: was feeling ill and needed to get home quickly.
C: relied on testimony that the judge had stricken and ordered the jury to disregard.
D: learned from a court clerk that the defendant had been accused of fraud in several recent lawsuits.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. A juror may not testify about a verdict, deliberations, or mental process in reaching a
verdict. However, a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was
improperly brought to the jury's attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear
upon any juror. If the jury obtained inadmissible and prejudicial information from a clerk that the defendant had
been accused of fraud in several recent lawsuits, the defendant's motion for a new trial will most likely be
granted. 

Answer A is incorrect because a possible misunderstanding as to the standard of proof by one juror is
inadmissible evidence and may not lead to a new trial. Answer B is incorrect because the juror's mental
process, that he wished to get home quickly, is inadmissible evidence and may not lead to a new trial. Answer
C is incorrect because relying on testimony that should have been disregarded is inadmissible evidence and
may not lead to a new trial. Only in answer D is there extraneous, prejudicial evidence that was improperly
brought to the jury's attention that would be admissible and allow for a new trial.

Question 933 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with using a forged prescription from a doctor to obtain Percodan from a drugstore
on May 1. At trial, the drugstore owner identified the defendant as the customer, but the defendant testified
that he had not been in the store. 

In rebuttal, the prosecutor calls two additional drug store owners to testify that, on May 1, a man they identified
as the defendant had presented prescriptions for Percodan from a doctor at their drug stores. 

The additional drug store owners' testimony is 

A: admissible, to prove a pertinent trait of the defendant's character and the defendant's action in conformity
therewith.
B: admissible, to identify the man who presented the prescription at the original drugstore.
C: inadmissible, because it proves specific acts rather than reputation or opinion.
D: inadmissible, because other crimes may not be used to show propensity.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of
a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. However, other crimes evidence can be admitted to
show identity, intent, preparation, or plan. The evidence the prosecutor seeks to admit is that the exact same
man, the defendant, had presented a forged prescription from the exact same doctor, for the exact same drug,
on the exact same day. That evidence would be admissible to prove the identity, which the defendant called
into question by his testimony, of the person who obtained the Percodan at the drugstore. 

Answer A is incorrect because evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the
character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. Answer C is incorrect because the
additional drug store owners' testimony is not being used to prove character; it is being used to prove identity.
Used for this purpose, the testimony is admissible even though it covers specific acts. Answer D is incorrect
because, although evidence of other crimes is inadmissible to prove propensity, evidence of the other crimes
in this case is admissible to prove identity.

Question 948 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant is on trial for theft. At trial, the prosecutor called a husband and wife. They testified that, as they
looked out their apartment window, they saw thieves across the street break the window of a jewelry store,
take jewelry, and leave in a car. The wife telephoned the police and relayed to them the license number of the
thieves' car as her husband looked out the window with binoculars and read it to her. Neither of them has any
present memory of the number. The prosecutor offers as evidence a properly authenticated police tape
recording of the wife's telephone call with her voice giving the license number, which is independently shown
to belong to the defendant's car. 

The tape recording of the wife stating the license is 

A: admissible, under the hearsay exception for present sense impressions.
B: admissible, as nonhearsay circumstantial evidence.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because the wife never had firsthand knowledge of the license number.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The tape recording of the wife's reading of the license plate number is an out-of-court
statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. However, the tape recording is a statement
describing or explaining an event or condition made while the wife was perceiving the event or condition. She
was recounting what her husband was saying. The husband's statements to his wife were also statements
describing or explaining an event or condition made while the husband was perceiving the event or condition -
the reading of the license plate from the vehicle. The tape recording is admissible because both statements,
the husband's to his wife and the wife's into the recording, meet the criteria of the present sense impression
exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer B is incorrect because the statements are hearsay. Answer C is incorrect because, although hearsay,
the statements are admissible under the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule. Answer D is
incorrect because the wife did have first-hand knowledge as to what her statement describes: the license plate
numbers her husband was stating to her. The husband himself had first-hand knowledge as to the license
number.

Question 950 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

The plaintiff sued a church for damages he suffered when the plaintiff crashed his motorcycle in an attempt to
avoid a cow that had escaped from its corral. The cow and corral belonged to a farm that had recently been
left by will to the church. At trial, the plaintiff seeks to ask the defendant's witness whether she is a member of
that church. 

The question is 

A: improper, because evidence of a witness's religious beliefs is not admissible to impeach credibility.
B: improper, because it violates First Amendment and privacy rights.
C: proper, for the purpose of ascertaining partiality or bias.
D: proper, for the purpose of showing capacity to appreciate the nature and obligation of an oath.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The witness's membership in the church would be relevant and admissible to
ascertain whether she has any possible bias or motive to lie for the defendant church. 

Answer A is incorrect because, although evidence of the beliefs or opinions of a witness on matters of religion
is not admissible for the purpose of showing that by reason of their nature the witness's credibility is impaired
or enhanced, the witness's membership in the defendant church is not being used for that improper reason. It
is being used to ascertain any bias or motive to lie she may have. Answer B is incorrect because violations of
First Amendment and privacy rights do not lead to the exclusion of evidence in this case. Because the
question is relevant and admissible, the witness cannot claim that the answer will violate her rights. Answer D
is incorrect because the evidence is not being used to show the witness's capacity to understand the oath; it is
being used to determine her possible motive to lie and her possible bias.

Question 954 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with the sale of narcotics. The federal prosecutor arranged with the defendant's wife
for her to testify against her husband in exchange for leniency in her case. At trial, the prosecution calls the
wife, who had been granted immunity from prosecution, to testify, among other things, that she saw her
husband sell an ounce of heroin. 

Which of the following statements is most clearly correct in the federal courts? 

A: The defendant's wife cannot be called as a witness over her husband's objection.
B: The defendant's wife can be called as a witness but cannot testify, over the defendant's objection, that she
saw him sell heroin.
C: The defendant's wife can refuse to be a witness against her husband.
D: The defendant's wife can be required to be a witness and to testify that she saw her husband sell heroin.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The wife's proposed testimony could lead to her invoking the adverse spousal
privilege, a privilege against testifying against her husband. That privilege, however, only exists at the wife's
discretion. The witness spouse, in this case the defendant's wife, alone has a privilege to refuse to testify
adversely against her husband; she may be neither compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying. The
choice is hers. 

Answer A is incorrect because the adverse spousal privilege is the wife's, and the determination of whether to
testify or not is her decision to make. The defendant cannot object and force his wife not to testify. Answer B is
incorrect because the defendant's wife can testify, if she wishes, that she saw her husband sell heroin. Her
testimony about her firsthand knowledge of the sale does not require that the wife disclose any privileged
marital communication from her husband. She will testify as to what she saw. Answer D is incorrect because
the adverse spousal privilege still exists. If the wife wishes not to testify against her husband, she cannot be
compelled, in federal court, to do so.

Question 957 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant is on trial for evading $100,000 in taxes. The prosecution offers in evidence an anonymous letter
to the IRS, identified as being in the defendant's handwriting, saying, "I promised my mother on her deathbed I
would try to pay my back taxes. Here is $10,000. I'll make other payments if you promise not to prosecute.
Answer yes by personal ad saying, 'OK on tax deal.'" 

The letter is 

A: admissible, as a statement of present intention or plan.
B: admissible, as an admission of a party opponent.
C: inadmissible, because it is an effort to settle a claim.
D: inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The anonymous letter is being offered against the defendant and is an admission by
him that he knows he owes back taxes. The letter is admissible as an admission by a party opponent. 

Answer A is incorrect because the letter is not a statement of the defendant's then existing mental condition
that the defendant intended to pay. Instead, the letter is being offered to prove that the defendant owed back
taxes. It is admissible as an admission, not as a statement of the defendant's intent. Answer C is incorrect
because, to be an inadmissible offer to compromise, the letter must be an attempt to compromise a claim
which was disputed as to either validity or amount. The defendant's offer was not made to settle the claim that
was in dispute; the statement was made in an attempt to stop the I.R.S. from prosecuting him. The policy
considerations which underlie the rule do not come into play when the goal is to induce a creditor to settle an
admittedly due amount for a lesser amount. The letter does not meet the requirements to be considered a valid
offer to compromise and is admissible. Answer D is incorrect because the letter is highly probative and any
prejudice against the defendant is not unfair. The admission of the letter is, of course, detrimental to the
defendant's defense, but that is not due to any unfair prejudice.

Question 961 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant is charged with aggravated assault on a game warden. The defendant testified that, when he was
confronted by the warden, who was armed and out of uniform, the defendant believed the warden was a
robber and shot in self-defense. The state calls a witness to testify that a year earlier, he had seen the
defendant shoot a man without provocation and thereafter falsely claimed self-defense. 

The witness's testimony is 

A: admissible, as evidence of the defendant's untruthfulness.
B: admissible, as evidence that the defendant did not act in self-defense on this occasion.
C: inadmissible, because it is improper character evidence.
D: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the defense the defendant raised.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Evidence of a person's character or a trait of character is not admissible for the
purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion. The witness's testimony is being
offered as evidence of the defendant's bad character. There is an exception that allows the prosecution to use
character evidence, but only if the evidence is being used to rebut character evidence introduced by the
defendant. Because the defendant did not introduce any character evidence intended to prove that he is a
nonviolent, peaceful person, the prosecution is not permitted to introduce evidence intended to prove the
defendant's violent character. 

Answer A is incorrect because the evidence of the prior shooting is evidence of a violent character, not for an
untruthful character. In addition, specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or
supporting the witness's character for truthfulness may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. Answer B is
incorrect because the fact that the defendant raised a self-defense claim in a prior case, whether successfully
or not, is inadmissible to prove the defendant did not act in self-defense in this case. The evidence of the prior
shooting and his defense cannot be used to show absence of self-defense in this case. Answer D is incorrect
because the evidence may be relevant, but it is specifically excluded by the rules of evidence dealing with the
character of the accused. See FRE 404(b).

Question 964 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a driver for damages for the death of the plaintiff's husband, resulting from an automobile
collision. At trial, the driver calls the husband's doctor to testify that the day before his death, the husband, in
great pain, said, "It was my own fault; there's nobody to blame but me." The doctor's testimony should be
admitted as 

A: a statement against interest.
B: a dying declaration.
C: a statement of the husband's then existing state of mind.
D: an excited utterance.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The husband's statement taking fault for the accident, at the time it was made, tended
to subject the husband to civil liability, and would render invalid any claim he had against the driver. A
reasonable person in the husband's position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be
true. The statement is admissible under the statement against interest exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer B is incorrect because there is no evidence that the husband made the statement knowing his death
was imminent or that the statement concerned the cause or circumstances of his death. Although he was in
great pain, there is no indication that the husband knew he was going to die and was making the statement as
a dying declaration. 

Answer C is incorrect because the husband's statement is being offered to prove he was at fault for the
accident, not to prove what was in his mind when he died. In addition, the statement is a statement of memory
or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed - that he was at fault. As such, it is specifically excluded
from the definition of a statement of then existing mental state and is inadmissible. 

Answer D is incorrect because there is no evidence that the husband's statement related to a startling event
and was made while he was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. The husband
may have been in great pain, but his statement was not an excited utterance because of the accident. The
doctor's testimony should be admitted as a statement against interest.

Question 973 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for an assault that occurred March 5 in California. To support his defense that he
was in Utah on that date, the defendant identifies and seeks to introduce a letter he wrote to his sister a week
before the assault in which he stated that he would see her in Utah on March 5. 

The letter is 

A: admissible, within the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.
B: admissible, as a prior consistent statement to support the defendant's credibility as a witness.
C: inadmissible, because it lacks sufficient probative value.
D: inadmissible, because it is a statement of belief to prove the fact believed.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. The defendant's letter to his sister describes the defendant's current mental condition
- that when he wrote the letter, he intended to go to visit his sister on March 5. The statement should be
admissible under the then existing mental condition/state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer B is incorrect because prior consistent statements cannot be used to support the testimony of the
witness unless the witness testifies, and the prior consistent statement is offered to rebut an express or implied
charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive. No such charge has been
raised against the defendant, so the letter does not meet the requirements for the prior consistent statement
exception. 

Answer C is incorrect because the letter is clearly evidence that has the tendency to make the existence of the
defendant's intent to be in Utah on March 5th more probable or less probable than it would be without the
evidence. As such, it is relevant, admissible evidence and should not be excluded as lacking in probative
value. 

Answer D is incorrect because the letter is not a statement of belief, but rather a statement of the defendant's
intent, and it is not being offered to prove the defendant went to Utah, but rather is admissible to show that the
defendant intended to be in Utah on March 5.

Question 981 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

Plaza Hotel sued Plaza House Hotel for infringement of its trade name. To establish a likelihood of name
confusion, plaintiff Plaza Hotel offers a series of memoranda which it had asked its employees to prepare at
the end of each day listing instances during the day in which telephone callers, cab drivers, customers, and
others had confused the two names. 

The memoranda should be 

A: excluded, because they are more unfairly prejudicial and confusing than probative.
B: excluded, because they are hearsay not within any exception.
C: admitted, because they are records of regularly conducted business activity.
D: admitted, because they are past recollection recorded.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The memoranda prepared by the employees are out-of-court statements that are
being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that these instances of confusion occurred. As such, they
are hearsay, and they do not meet the requirements of any exception. The memoranda should be excluded
from evidence. 

Answer A is incorrect because the memoranda should be excluded under the hearsay rule, not because they
are more prejudicial and confusing than probative. The facts sought to be introduced by the memoranda - that
customers and potential customers are confused by the possible trade name infringement - are clearly
probative and not unfairly prejudicial. It is because these events are contained in the hearsay memoranda that
they are inadmissible. Answer C is incorrect because the memoranda are not records that are kept in the
course of the Plaza Hotel's regularly conducted business activity. The hotel is not in the business of creating
memoranda in regards to possible litigation, so the memoranda are not done in the hotel's regular course of
business and are inadmissible as hearsay. Answer D is incorrect because the memoranda are not being
offered through a witness who is unable to fully and accurately testify as to the events. The memoranda are
not prior recollection recorded in this case and are inadmissible as hearsay.

Question 987 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

In a federal investigation of a defendant for tax fraud, the grand jury seeks to obtain a letter written January 15
by the defendant to her attorney in which she stated: "Please prepare a deed giving my ranch to the university
but, in order to get around the tax law, I want it back-dated to December 15." The attorney refuses to produce
the letter on the ground of privilege. 

Production of the letter should be 

A: prohibited, because the statement is protected by the attorney-client privilege.
B: prohibited, because the statement is protected by the client's privilege against self-incrimination.
C: required, because the statement was in furtherance of crime or fraud.
D: required, because the attorney-client privilege belongs to the client and can be claimed only by her.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. The attorney-client privilege will cover confidential communications made during a
legal consultation between an attorney and client. However, if the services of the lawyer were sought or
obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan to commit a crime or a fraud, the privilege does not apply.
The defendant's letter explicitly states that the deed she is seeking should be back-dated to avoid the tax law.
Because the services sought by the defendant from her attorney were for the commission of tax fraud, the
communication will not be privileged and the production of the letter should be required. 

Answer A is incorrect because it ignores the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. Answer B is
incorrect because the letter, although certainly incriminating, was not made to law enforcement officers in a
custodial interrogation. Answer D is incorrect because the attorney can assert the privilege on behalf of the
client.

Question 994 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for breach of a commercial contract in which the defendant had agreed to sell the
plaintiff all of the plaintiff's requirements for widgets. The plaintiff called an expert witness to testify as to
damages. On cross-examination, the defendant seeks to elicit from the expert witness that he had provided
false testimony as a witness in his own divorce proceedings. 

This evidence should be 

A: admitted, because the evidence was elicited from the expert witness on cross-examination.
B: admitted, because the questioning can be substantiated by clear and convincing extrinsic evidence.
C: excluded, because it is impeachment on a collateral issue.
D: excluded, because it is improper character evidence.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Specific instances of misconduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or
supporting the witness's character for truthfulness, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may,
however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on
cross-examination of the witness. The expert witness's false testimony in his divorce proceeding is probative of
his character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and can be inquired into upon in cross-examination. 

Answer B is incorrect because extrinsic evidence of the prior false testimony is inadmissible and does not
need to be shown by clear and convincing evidence. Answer C is incorrect because the expert witness's
character for truthfulness or untruthfulness is not a collateral issue and may be inquired into during
cross-examination. Answer D is incorrect because character evidence is admissible against a witness if it goes
to the witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. The defendant is allowed to question an expert
witness regarding his prior false testimony.

Question 1005 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A corporation sued its former vice president for return of $230,000 that had been embezzled during the
previous two years. Called by the corporation as an adverse witness, the vice president testified that his
annual salary had been $75,000, and he denied the embezzlement. The corporation calls a banker to show
that, during the two-year period, the vice president had deposited $250,000 in his bank account. 

The banker's testimony is 

A: admissible as circumstantial evidence of the vice president's guilt.
B: admissible to impeach the vice president.
C: inadmissible, because its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value.
D: inadmissible, because the deposits could have come from legitimate sources.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Evidence that the vice president's bank deposits consisted of more money than he
legally earned has the tendency to make embezzlement more probable than it would be in the absence of that
evidence. The banker's testimony is relevant, circumstantial evidence to show the vice president's guilt, and is
admissible. 

Answer B is incorrect because the banker's testimony would not serve to impeach any testimony the vice
president previously gave. It would not necessarily have any bearing on the credibility of the vice president's
prior testimony, and thus there would be no grounds for impeachment. Answer C is incorrect because the
evidence is clearly probative, and, although damaging to the vice president's case, is not prejudicial. Answer D
is incorrect because the admissibility of evidence is determined by its relevance to the case, not its possible
explanations. Although the deposits could have come from legitimate sources, the evidence of the deposits is
still admissible to show that the vice president had more money than he legally earned.

Question 1007 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for illegal discrimination, claiming that the defendant fired him because of his race.
At trial, the plaintiff called a witness, expecting him to testify that the defendant had admitted the racial
motivation. Instead, the witness testified that the defendant said that he had fired the plaintiff because of his
frequent absenteeism. While the witness is still on the stand, the plaintiff offers a properly authenticated secret
tape recording he had made at a meeting with the witness in which the witness related the defendant's
admissions of racial motivation. 

The tape recording is 

A: admissible as evidence of the defendant's racial motivation and to impeach the witness's testimony.
B: admissible only to impeach the witness's testimony.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because a secret recording is an invasion of the witness's right of privacy under the U.S.
Constitution.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The tape recording is admissible to impeach the witness's testimony that the
defendant fired the plaintiff for frequent absenteeism. However, the tape recording contains out-of-court
statements that are being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the defendant fired the plaintiff
because of his race. As such, it is hearsay. Since it does not meet the requirements of any exception to the
hearsay rule, the tape is inadmissible as substantive evidence. 

Answer A is incorrect because prior inconsistent statements are inadmissible as substantive evidence unless
they were given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a
deposition. Answer C is incorrect because, although the statements on the tape recording are hearsay, they
can still be used to impeach the witness's testimony that the plaintiff was fired for absenteeism. Answer D is
incorrect because the statements on the tape were not privileged communications, and whatever invasion of
privacy that may have occurred would not affect the admissibility of the evidence because the taping was not
done by the state.

Question 1025 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff's estate sued a defendant, a store, claiming that one of the defendant's security guards wrongfully
shot and killed the plaintiff when the plaintiff fled after being accused of shoplifting. The guard was convicted of
manslaughter for killing the plaintiff. At his criminal trial the guard, who was no longer working for the
defendant, testified that the defendant's security director had instructed him to stop shoplifters "at all costs."
Because the guard's criminal conviction is on appeal, he refuses to testify at the civil trial. The plaintiff's estate
then offers an authenticated transcript of the guard's criminal trial testimony concerning the instructions of the
defendant's security director. 

This evidence is 

A: admissible as a statement of an agent of a party-opponent.
B: admissible, because the instruction from the security director is not hearsay.
C: admissible, although hearsay, as former testimony.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The defendant store was not a party to the prior criminal trial and its attorney was
never afforded the opportunity to develop the guard's testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination. The
defendant store, against whom the guard's testimony is sought to be admitted, was not a predecessor in
interest to the prosecutor, and the prosecutor did not have the motive to cross examine the guard's testimony
regarding the defendant store's involvement in the crime. For these reasons, the guard's testimony at his
criminal trial does not meet the requirements of the prior testimony exception to the hearsay rule and is
inadmissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because the guard, when he made the statements, was no longer employed by the
defendant store so his admissions were not made by an agent of a party opponent. Answer B is incorrect
because the hearsay sought to be admitted is the guard's testimony that the director told him to stop
shoplifters at any cost. The guard's testimony is hearsay not within any exception to the hearsay rule. Answer
C is incorrect because the defendant store was not able to develop the guard's prior testimony through cross
examination. The guard's testimony does not meet the requirements of the prior testimony exception to the
hearsay rule and is inadmissible.

Question 1026 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for shooting her husband from ambush. The plaintiff offers to testify that, the day
before her husband was killed, he described to her a chance meeting with the defendant on the street in which
the defendant said, "I'm going to blow your head off one of these days." 

The witness's testimony concerning her husband's statement is 

A: admissible, to show the defendant's state of mind.
B: admissible, because the defendant's statement is that of a party-opponent.
C: inadmissible, because it is improper evidence of a prior bad act.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The deceased's statement to his wife that the defendant told him that the defendant
was going to blow the deceased's head off one of these days is an out-of-court statement that is being offered
for the truth of the matter asserted - that the defendant threatened the deceased. This statement is thus
hearsay and is inadmissible because it does not meet the requirements for any exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer A is incorrect because the hearsay statement is the deceased's statement to his wife. The defendant's
statement to the deceased may be admissible to show the defendant's state of mind, but the deceased
relaying that statement to his wife is another level of hearsay that has no exception and is thus inadmissible.
Therefore answer B is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because the statement is inadmissible because it is
hearsay, not because it is improper evidence of a prior bad act. The prior bad act of threatening the deceased,
if not hearsay, would be admissible to show the defendant's motive. However, it is hearsay, and thus
inadmissible.

Question 1026 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for shooting her husband from ambush. The plaintiff offers to testify that, the day
before her husband was killed, he described to her a chance meeting with the defendant on the street in which
the defendant said, "I'm going to blow your head off one of these days." 

The witness's testimony concerning her husband's statement is 

A: admissible, to show the defendant's state of mind.
B: admissible, because the defendant's statement is that of a party-opponent.
C: inadmissible, because it is improper evidence of a prior bad act.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The deceased's statement to his wife that the defendant told him that the defendant
was going to blow the deceased's head off one of these days is an out-of-court statement that is being offered
for the truth of the matter asserted - that the defendant threatened the deceased. This statement is thus
hearsay and is inadmissible because it does not meet the requirements for any exception to the hearsay rule. 

Answer A is incorrect because the hearsay statement is the deceased's statement to his wife. The defendant's
statement to the deceased may be admissible to show the defendant's state of mind, but the deceased
relaying that statement to his wife is another level of hearsay that has no exception and is thus inadmissible.
Therefore answer B is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because the statement is inadmissible because it is
hearsay, not because it is improper evidence of a prior bad act. The prior bad act of threatening the deceased,
if not hearsay, would be admissible to show the defendant's motive. However, it is hearsay, and thus
inadmissible.

Question 1032 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A defendant is on trial for robbing a bank in State A. She testified that she was in State B at the time of the
robbery. The defendant calls her friend, a witness, to testify that two days before the robbery the defendant
told him that she was going to spend the next three days in State B. 

The witness's testimony is 

A: admissible, because the statement falls within the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule.
B: admissible, because a statement of plans falls within the hearsay exception for then-existing state of mind.
C: inadmissible, because it is offered to establish an alibi by the defendant's own statement.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The defendant's statement to the witness describes the defendant's current mental
condition, which was that she intended to go spend the next three days in State B. The statement is admissible
under the then-existing mental condition exception to the hearsay rule. Statement of future plans falls within
the hearsay exception for then-existing state of mind. 

Answer A is incorrect because the defendant's statement that she was going to State B for the next three days
is not a statement describing or explaining an event or condition, and it was not made while the defendant was
perceiving that event or condition. It is thus not a present sense impression, it is a statement of then-existing
state of mind. Answer C is incorrect because it misstates the standard for determining admissible hearsay
statements. Answer C is also incorrect because the statement is offered to show that the defendant had plans,
not to show that the defendant followed through with those plans. Answer D is incorrect because the
statement, although hearsay, falls under the then-existing state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.

Question 1038 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for breach of contract. The plaintiff's position was that the woman, whom he
understood to be the defendant's agent, said, "On behalf of [the defendant], I accept your offer." The defendant
asserted that the woman had no actual or apparent authority to accept the offer on the defendant's behalf. 

The plaintiff's testimony concerning the woman's statement is 

A: admissible, provided the court first finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the woman had actual or
apparent authority to act for the defendant.
B: admissible, upon or subject to introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding by the jury that the
woman had actual or apparent authority to act for the defendant.
C: inadmissible, if the woman does not testify and her absence is not excused.
D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The relevancy of the woman's statement to the plaintiff is conditioned on the showing
that the woman had actual or apparent authority to act for the defendant. If the woman did not have actual or
apparent authority to act for the defendant, the statement would be irrelevant to the plaintiff's case against the
defendant and it should not be admitted. However, the statement is admissible subject to the introduction of
evidence sufficient to support a finding that the woman had actual or apparent authority to act for the
defendant. 

Answer A is incorrect because it misstates the standard for determining the admissibility of evidence whose
relevance is conditioned on facts not yet shown. The court does not have to make a finding by a
preponderance of the evidence before it admits the statement, it may admit the statement subject to evidence
sufficient to support a finding that the woman had authority to act for the defendant. Answer C is incorrect
because the woman's availability to testify is irrelevant for the admission of her statement to the plaintiff.
Answer D is incorrect because, if the woman had apparent or actual authority to act for the defendant, the
statement would not be hearsay, it would be an admission by a party opponent. A statement can be admitted
into evidence conditional on a finding that the statement is relevant and non-hearsay. If the conditions are met,
the statement remains in evidence. If not, the statement is struck by the court.

Question 1045 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant is on trial for the murder of his father. The defendant's defense is that he shot his father
accidentally. The prosecutor calls a witness, a police officer, to testify that on two occasions in the year prior to
this incident, he had been called to the defendant's home because of complaints of loud arguments between
the defendant and his father, and had found it necessary to stop the defendant from beating his father. 

The evidence is 

A: inadmissible, because it is improper character evidence.
B: inadmissible, because the witness lacks first-hand knowledge of who started the quarrels.
C: admissible to show that the defendant killed his father intentionally.
D: admissible to show that the defendant is a violent person.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. Evidence of other acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to
show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes such as intent and
absence of mistake or accident. The defendant's prior arguments and near-beatings of his father are
admissible to prove that the killing of his father was not accidental, and was, in fact, intentional. 

Answer A is incorrect because this type of character evidence is not being offered to prove action in conformity
therewith, but rather intent and absence of mistake or accident. Thus it is proper and admissible. Answer B is
incorrect because the witness does not need to know who started the quarrels in order to make this evidence
relevant to the issue of whether the defendant shot his father intentionally or accidentally. Answer D is
incorrect because evidence of other acts is not admissible to show the defendant's violent character. It is
admissible, however, to show intent and lack of mistake or accident.

Question 1055 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued an auto manufacturing company for his wife's death, claiming that a defective steering
mechanism on the family car caused it to veer off the road and hit a tree when his wife was driving. The
defendant claims that the steering mechanism was damaged in the collision and offers testimony that the
deceased wife was intoxicated at the time of the accident. 

Testimony concerning the wife's intoxication is 

A: admissible to provide an alternate explanation of the accident's cause.
B: admissible as proper evidence of the wife's character.
C: inadmissible, because it is improper to prove character evidence by specific conduct.
D: inadmissible, because it is substantially more prejudicial than probative.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Evidence of the plaintiff's wife's intoxication while she was driving is relevant and
admissible to show the possible cause or causes of the accident. Answer B is incorrect because the plaintiff's
wife's intoxication at the time of the accident is not character evidence; it is evidence of her factual, bodily state
at the time of the accident. It is relevant because her intoxication may have caused the accident. Answer C is
incorrect because the evidence of the wife's intoxication at the time of the accident is not character evidence.
Answer D is incorrect because evidence of the wife's intoxication is probative on the issue of the cause of the
accident, and is not unfairly prejudicial.

Question 1058 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A construction company sued a development company for money owed on a cost-plus contract that required
notice of proposed expenditures beyond original estimates. The defendant asserted that it never received the
required notice. At trial the plaintiff calls a witness, its general manager, to testify that it is the plaintiff's routine
practice to send cost overrun notices as required by the contract. The witness also offers a photocopy of the
cost overrun notice letter to the defendant on which the plaintiff is relying, and which he has taken from the
plaintiff's regular business files. 

On the issue of giving notice, the letter copy is 

A: admissible, though hearsay, under the business record exception.
B: admissible, because of the routine practices of the company.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: inadmissible, because it is not the best evidence of the notice.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. On the issue of notice, the letter copy is not being offered for the truth of the matter
asserted – i.e. what the proposed expenditures beyond the original estimates were. The letter copy is being
offered to show that the plaintiff sent the letter, not the actual contents of the letter; therefore, it is not hearsay.
In addition, evidence of the routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of
the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the organization on a particular occasion
was in conformity with the routine practice. 

Answer A is incorrect because the letter copy, offered on the issue of notice, is not hearsay because it is not
being offered for the truth of the matter asserted in the letter. Answer C is incorrect because the letter copy,
offered on the issue of notice, is not hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted
in the letter. Answer D is incorrect because the duplicate letter is admissible to the same extent as an original.

Question 1062 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

In a jurisdiction without a Dead Man's Statute, a deceased man's estate sued the defendant claiming that the
defendant had borrowed $10,000 from the deceased man, which had not been repaid as of the man's death.
The man was run over by a truck. At the accident scene, while dying from massive injuries, the man told a
police offficer to "make sure my estate collects the $10,000 I loaned to the defendant." 

The police officer's testimony about the deceased man's statement is 

A: inadmissible, because it is more unfairly prejudicial than probative.
B: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
C: admissible as an excited utterance.
D: admissible as a statement under belief of impending death.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The deceased man's statement to the police officer is an out-of-court statement that
is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted - that the deceased man loaned the defendant $10,000. As
such, it is hearsay, and it is inadmissible because it does not meet the requirements for any exception to the
hearsay rule. 

Answer A is incorrect because the statement is inadmissible as hearsay, not because the statement is not
probative. Answer C is incorrect because the deceased man's statement was about the loan and not related to
a startling event or condition, so it is not an excited utterance. Answer D is incorrect because the deceased
man's statement was about the loan and not concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant
believed to be impending death. As such, it is not a dying declaration. Because the deceased man's statement
is hearsay, and it does not meet the requirements of any exception, it is inadmissible.

Question 1069 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant is charged with murder in connection with a carjacking incident during which the defendant
allegedly shot the victim while attempting to steal the victim's car. The prosecutor calls the victim's
four-year-old son, whose face was horribly disfigured by the same bullet, to testify that the defendant shot his
father and him. 

The prosecutor has presented evidence showing that the son has personal knowledge of the incident,
understands the oath to testify truthfully, and has the cognitive ability of a seven-year-old. The son's testimony
should be 

A: admitted, because the prosecutor has provided evidence that the son has the cognitive ability of a
seven-year-old.
B: admitted, because there is sufficient basis for believing that the son has personal knowledge and
understands his obligation to testify truthfully.
C: excluded, because it is insufficiently probative in view of the son's tender age.
D: excluded, because it is more unfairly prejudicial than probative.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Every person is competent to be a witness, as long as the person meets the
requirements of having personal knowledge and taking the oath to testify truthfully. A witness may not testify to
a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge
of the matter. In addition, before testifying, every witness shall be required to declare that the witness will
testify truthfully, by oath or affirmation administered in a form calculated to awaken the witness's conscience
and impress the witness's mind with the duty to do so. Because the prosecutor has admitted evidence
providing a sufficient basis for believing the son has personal knowledge and understands his obligation to
testify truthfully, the son's testimony should be admitted. 

Answer A is incorrect because it misstates the requirements of the fitness for a witness to testify. Likewise,
answer C is incorrect because the son's age is irrelevant to whether his testimony is probative, and because
the son's testimony that he saw the defendant shoot him and his father is clearly highly probative to the case.
Answer D is incorrect because the son's testimony is highly probative to the case and is not unfairly prejudicial.
The son's testimony is certainly detrimental to the defendant's case, but it is not unfairly prejudicial.

Question 1076 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

While on trial for murdering her husband, a defendant testified that she acted in self-defense. The defendant
calls an expert, a psychologist, to testify that under hypnosis the defendant had described the killing, and that
in the expert's opinion the defendant had been in fear for her life at the time of the killing. 

Is the expert's testimony admissible? 

A: Yes, because the expert was able to ascertain that the defendant was speaking truthfully.
B: Yes, because it reports a prior consistent statement by a witness (the defendant) subject to examination
concerning it.
C: No, because reliance on information tainted by hypnosis is unconstitutional.
D: No, because it expresses an opinion concerning the defendant's mental state at the time of the killing.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. No expert witness testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a
defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have
the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or of a defense thereto. Such
ultimate issues are matters for the trier of fact alone. The expert's testimony is inadmissible because, by
opining that the defendant had been in fear for her life at the time of the killing, it expresses an opinion
concerning the defendant's mental state. 

Answer A is incorrect because an expert witness cannot testify that another witness's statements are truthful,
and also because the expert gave an opinion as to the defendant's ultimate state of mind, which an issue for
the jury to decide. Answer B is incorrect because the prior consistent statements are not admissible, and again
because the expert gave an opinion as to the defendant's ultimate state of mind, which an issue for the jury to
decide. Answer C is incorrect because it is not unconstitutional to allow testimony obtained under hypnosis.

Question 1083 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for injuries suffered in a car accident allegedly caused by brakes that had been
negligently repaired by the defendant. At a settlement conference, the plaintiff exhibited the brake shoe that
caused the accident and pointed out the alleged defect to an expert, whom the defendant had brought to the
conference. No settlement was reached. At trial, the brake shoe having disappeared, the plaintiff seeks to
testify concerning the condition of the shoe. 

The plaintiff's testimony is 

A: admissible, because the defendant's expert had been able to examine the shoe carefully.
B: admissible, because the plaintiff had personal knowledge of the shoe's condition.
C: inadmissible, because the brake shoe was produced and examined as a part of settlement negotiations.
D: inadmissible, because the plaintiff did not establish that the disappearance was not his fault.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Because the plaintiff had personal knowledge of the brake shoe's condition, the
plaintiff can testify to the condition of the shoe. Answer A is incorrect because the defendant's expert need not
have examined the shoe before the plaintiff can testify about its condition. Answer C is incorrect because it is
irrelevant that the brake shoe was produced and examined as part of settlement negotiations. Answer D is
incorrect because the plaintiff does not need to establish that the disappearance was not his fault before the
plaintiff can testify about its condition. A witness may testify to matters within his personal knowledge, and,
because the item of evidence is not a writing, recording, or photograph, no other requirements are necessary.

Question 1086 - Evidence - Writings Recordings and Photographs

 The question was: 

A defendant is on trial for nighttime breaking and entering of a warehouse. The warehouse owner had set up a
camera to take infrared pictures of any intruders. After an expert establishes the reliability of infrared
photography, the prosecutor offers the authenticated infrared picture of the intruder to show the similarities to
the defendant. 

The photograph is 

A: admissible, because an expert witness can point out to the jury the similarities between the person in the
photograph and the defendant.
B: admissible, allowing the jury to compare the person in the photograph and the defendant.
C: inadmissible, because there was no eyewitness to the scene available to authenticate the photograph.
D: inadmissible, because infrared photography deprives a defendant of the right to confront witnesses.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. The infrared photograph, once authenticated, can be identified by comparison by the
trier of fact with the defendant. The photograph is admissible as substantive evidence and the jury should be
allowed to compare the person in the photograph and the defendant. 

Answer A is incorrect because the expert witness is not required to point out the similarities to the jury before
the photograph is identifiable and admissible. Answer C is incorrect because there does not need to be an
eyewitness to the scene available to authenticate the photograph if the photo is already authenticated by the
testimony of the expert witness. Answer D is incorrect because the photograph is not a witness that the
defendant has a right to "confront." Because the jury is able to make a comparison between the photograph
and the defendant, the photograph is admissible.

Question 1098 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for personal injuries suffered in a train-automobile collision. The plaintiff called an
eyewitness, who testified that the train was going 20 miles per hour. The defendant then offers the testimony
of an experienced police accident investigator that, based on his training and experience and on his
examination of the physical evidence, it is his opinion that the train was going between 5 and 10 miles per
hour. 

Testimony by the investigator is 

A: improper, because there cannot be both lay and expert opinion on the same issue.
B: improper, because the investigator is unable to establish the speed with a sufficient degree of scientific
certainty.
C: proper, because a police accident investigator has sufficient expertise to express an opinion on speed.
D: proper, because the plaintiff first introduced opinion evidence as to speed.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is C. If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to
understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill,
experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion. The police accident
investigator's opinion was based upon sufficient facts, was the product of reliable principles and methods, and
the investigator has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. The testimony of the
investigator, because he has sufficient expertise to express an opinion, is admissible. 

Answer A is incorrect because it is a misstatement of the law. There certainly can be both lay and expert
opinion on the same issue. Answer B is incorrect because the investigator relied on his training and
experience, as well as his examination of the physical evidence, to reach his opinion on the speed of the train,
which is the proper standard for the admissibility of his opinion. Answer D is incorrect because the ability of the
investigator to give an opinion on the speed of the train is not conditioned on the plaintiff's first introducing
opinion evidence on speed. Even if the plaintiff had not entered any opinion evidence on speed, the
investigator's testimony would still be admissible.

Question 1117 - Evidence - Privileges and Other Policy Exclusions

 The question was: 

A passenger is suing a defendant for injuries suffered in the crash of a small airplane, alleging that the
defendant had owned the plane and negligently failed to have it properly maintained. The defendant has
asserted in defense that he never owned the plane or had any responsibility to maintain it. At trial, the
passenger calls a witness to testify that the witness had sold to the defendant a liability insurance policy on the
plane. 

The testimony of the witness is 

A: inadmissible, because the policy itself is required under the original document rule.
B: inadmissible, because of the rule against proof of insurance where insurance is not itself at issue.
C: admissible to show that the defendant had little motivation to invest money in maintenance of the airplane.
D: admissible as some evidence of the defendant's ownership of or responsibility for the airplane.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. The witness's testimony that he had sold liability insurance on the plane to the
defendant is admissible evidence to show the defendant's ownership or responsibility for the plane. It is
relevant because the defendant has denied ownership. Answer A is incorrect because the witness is not
testifying to the content of the policy, only to its existence, and is not required to introduce the policy itself
before he can testify. Answer B is incorrect because it misstates the standard for determining whether the
witness's testimony is admissible. Answer C is incorrect because the existence of the policy is admissible and
relevant to show the defendant's ownership or responsibility for the airplane, not his motivation to invest money
in the airplane. It is the defendant's ownership of the plane that is at issue, and the witness's testimony is
admissible as proof on that issue.

Question 1128 - Evidence - Hearsay and Circumstances of Its Admissibility

 The question was: 

A pedestrian died from injuries caused when a driver's car struck him. The pedestrian's executor sued the
driver for wrongful death. At trial, the executor calls a nurse to testify that two days after the accident, the
pedestrian said to the nurse, "The car that hit me ran the red light." Fifteen minutes thereafter, the pedestrian
died. 

As a foundation for introducing evidence of the pedestrian's statement, the executor offers to the court the
doctor's affidavit that the doctor was the intern on duty the day of the pedestrian's death and that several times
that day the pedestrian had said that he knew he was about to die. 

Is the affidavit properly considered by the court in ruling on the admissibility of the pedestrian's statement? 

A: No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
B: No, because it is irrelevant since dying declarations can only be used in prosecutions for homicide.
C: Yes, because, though hearsay, it is a statement of then-existing mental condition.
D: Yes, because the judge may consider hearsay in ruling on preliminary questions.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. Preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by
the court. In making its determination, the court is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect
to privileges. The judge may consider the affidavit, even though it is hearsay, in making its determination of the
admissibility of the pedestrian's statements. 

Answer A is incorrect because, although the affidavit is hearsay, the judge can consider hearsay in preliminary
determinations of admissibility. Answer B is incorrect because dying declarations can be used in civil actions.
Answer C is incorrect because, although the affidavit is hearsay, the judge can consider hearsay in preliminary
determinations of admissibility. In addition, the affidavit itself is not a statement of then-existing mental
condition; it is a statement of what the pedestrian said and did.

Question 1134 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff sued a defendant for personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident. 

Which of the following would be an ERROR? 

A: The judge allows the defendant's attorney to ask the defendant questions on cross-examination that go well
beyond the scope of direct examination by the plaintiff, who has been called as an adverse witness.
B: The judge refuses to allow the defendant's attorney to cross-examine the defendant by leading questions.
C: The judge allows cross-examination about the credibility of a witness even though no question relating to
credibility has been asked on direct examination.
D: The judge, despite the defendant's request for exclusion of witnesses, allows the plaintiff's eyewitnesses to
remain in the courtroom after testifying, even though the eyewitness is expected to be recalled for further
cross-examination.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is D. At the request of a party, the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot
hear the testimony of other witnesses. Because the court in answer D did not exclude witnesses after the
defendant had requested it, the court acted in error. 

Answer A is incorrect because the judge may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry during
cross-examination into additional matters as if on direct examination. Because the court has the discretion to
allow the questioning in that manner, allowing the questioning is not error. Answer B is incorrect because,
although ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination, there is no requirement that
the judge must allow the defendant's attorney to use leading questions on cross-examination of the defendant.
Answer C is incorrect because matters affecting the credibility of the witness can be asked on
cross-examination, regardless of whether they had been asked on direct examination. Only in answer D is
there a requirement that the judge take an action, and to fail to do so would amount to error.

Question 1135 - Evidence - Presentation of Evidence

 The question was: 

A plaintiff is suing a defendant for injuries suffered in an automobile collision. At trial the plaintiff's first witness
testified that, although she did not see the accident, she heard her friend say just before the crash, "Look at
the crazy way old [defendant] is driving!" The defendant offers evidence to impeach the witness's friend by
asking the witness, "Isn't it true that [the friend] beat up [the defendant] just the day before the collision?" 

The question is 

A: proper, because it tends to show possible bias of the witness's friend against the defendant.
B: proper, because it tends to show the witness's friend's character.
C: improper, because the witness's friend has no opportunity to explain or deny it.
D: improper, because impeachment cannot properly be by specific instances.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. When a hearsay statement has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the
declarant may be attacked, and, if attacked, may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for
those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness. Because the witness's friend's statement has been
entered into evidence, the defendant is permitted to inquire into any possible bias or motive to lie that the
friend has for the making of that statement. The fact that the friend may have beaten up the defendant the day
before the accident is relevant to show that the friend has a dislike and bias against the defendant that may
lead to his making a false statement. 

Answer B is incorrect because, except for being relevant to the friend's motive to lie about the defendant, the
fact that the friend beat up the defendant has no relevance to the friend's character for truthfulness or
untruthfulness. The friend's character for beating people up would be inadmissible. 

Answer C is incorrect because the friend need not have an opportunity to explain or deny before the question
can properly be asked. Because the question is relevant to show why the friend may have made the
statement, it is proper for the defendant to ask it. 

Answer D is incorrect because the question is being asked to establish the friend's motive to lie about the
defendant in his statement, and is proper. Additionally, specific instances of conduct, if for the purpose of
attacking a witness's credibility, can be inquired into on cross-examination.

Question 1139 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

A defendant was charged with attempted murder of a victim in a sniping incident in which the defendant
allegedly shot at the victim from ambush as the victim drove his car along an expressway. The prosecutor
offers evidence that seven years earlier the defendant had fired a shotgun into a woman's house and that the
defendant had once pointed a handgun at another driver while driving on the street. 

This evidence should be 

A: excluded, because such evidence can be elicited only during cross-examination.
B: excluded, because it is improper character evidence.
C: admitted as evidence of the defendant's propensity toward violence.
D: admitted as relevant evidence of the defendant's identity, plan, or motive.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is B. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of
a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. The evidence the prosecution is seeking to admit is
being offered only to show the defendant's bad character and that he was acting in conformity therewith. The
evidence should be excluded. 

Answer A is incorrect because the defendant has not testified. In addition, even if the defendant takes the
stand, the evidence cannot be inquired into on cross examination because only specific incidents probative on
the issue of truthfulness or untruthfulness, which these prior bad acts are not, can be asked of the witness.
Answer C is incorrect because evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible character evidence
when it is used in order to show action in conformity with those wrongs. Answer D is incorrect because
although evidence may be admissible to prove identity, plan, or motive, none of the incidents the prosecution
is seeking to introduce is relevant on any of those issues. There are no common elements, outside of their
being instances of the defendant's bad character with a weapon, between the prior crimes and the current
crime that would be relevant on the issue of identity, plan, or motive. The other incidents are only sought to be
introduced to show the defendant's poor character, and the evidence of those incidents should be suppressed.

Question 1145 - Evidence - Relevancy and Excluding Relevant Evidence

 The question was: 

At a defendant's murder trial, the defendant calls his first witness to testify that the defendant has a reputation
in their community as a peaceable and truthful person. The prosecutor objects on the ground that the witness's
testimony would constitute improper character evidence. 

The court should 

A: admit the testimony as to peaceableness, but exclude the testimony as to truthfulness.
B: admit the testimony as to truthfulness, but exclude the testimony as to peaceableness.
C: admit the testimony as to both character traits.
D: exclude the testimony as to both character traits.

The explanation for the answer is:

The correct answer is A. Although evidence of a person's character or a trait of character is not admissible for
the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, there is an exception that allows
the accused to offer evidence of a trait of character that is pertinent to the trial. In a case where the charge is
murder, the accused's reputation in the community as being a peaceable person would be a pertinent trait and
should be admissible if proposed by the accused. However, the accused's reputation in the community as a
truthful person would not be pertinent to the murder charge, and should be inadmissible. Because the
defendant has not testified, his reputation in the community as a truthful person would be irrelevant and
inadmissible. 

Answer B is incorrect because the evidence for truthfulness should be excluded and the evidence of
peaceableness should be admitted. Answer C is incorrect because the evidence for truthfulness should be
excluded and the evidence of peaceableness should be admitted. Answer D is incorrect because the evidence
for truthfulness should be excluded and the evidence of peaceableness should be admitted.

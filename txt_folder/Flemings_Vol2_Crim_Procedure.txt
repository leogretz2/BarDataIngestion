41. Pawnshops, in the city of Tomato, are
closely regulated. The reason for the
regulations are that, such are often used
to "fence" stolen property, that illegal
guns are often sold through pawnshops
and that the city has received hundreds
of complaints regarding the shops.

quirement that, in order to do business,
the pawnshop must keep complete
records of all chattels received, from

tels sold, and to whom such were sold.
Moreover, in applying for a business
license, they also consent to inspection
of the above by the police.

shop, is inspected by Officer Lemon.
He finds several violations, including
a weapon violation that subjects the
owner of Dirtball to criminal liability.

exception to the warrant require-
ment.

B. No, because of the administrative

exception.

waives the warnings, then starts talking.
Ultimately, after 45 minutes, Joe makes
a highly incriminating statement. Is the
statement admissible, in a subsequent
criminal trial, for extortion?

C. Yes, because a warrant was re-

He opened the purse, found cigarettes
inside and accused Aire Head of lying.
While reaching into the purse, Locke
noticed a small glass vile, containing a
white powdery substance. Thinking it
was likely cocaine, he further searched
the purse and found three more vials
full of the same white substance, a glass
straw and a mirror. Aire Head admitted
to having a drug problem.

Locke notified Aire Head's mother and
turned the purse over to the police. The
white powdery substance proves to be
cocaine. Aire Head was prosecuted for
illegal possession of cocaine with the
intent to sell. Aire Head's attorney files
a motion to suppress the cocaine and
cocaine paraphernalia. This motion will
fail because:

52. Mr. Lifer, a prisoner in State Peniten-
tiary, was sound asleep in his prison
cell, dreaming of life on the outside,
before he killed his fiancé. His dream
was interrupted by Mr. Guard, a prison
guard at "State Penn." Guard snuck
into Lifer's prison cell and proceeded
to search through Lifer's belongings.
Guard woke Lifer up when he found
three small balloons of heroin stuck un-
derneath Lifer's bed. Lifer denied any
knowledge of the heroin. Guard notified
the prison's warden. Lifer was sent to
solitary confinement for three weeks. At
trial, Lifer, representing himself, files a
motion to suppress the heroin. Are the
balloons of heroin admissible against
Lifer?

A. No, because Guard had no war-
rant to conduct such a search.

B. No, because there was no exigent

B. Locke's search did not violate the

Fourth Amendment.	

C. Yes, if Guard was acting on a tip
from a reliable informant.

C. The search was conducted by a

school official.	

D. Yes, because Lifer is a prisoner

in the State Penitentiary.

D. Locke's search, resulting in the
discovery of the evidence of
cocaine, was "reasonable."

B. No, because the circumstances
did not dictate that the U.S.
Marshal needed to secure a war-

C. Yes, because the U.S. Marshal
acted without sanction of law.

D. Yes, because Mac made a sea-
sonal application for the return
of his property.

54. Assuming the same facts in question 53,
should the government be permitted to
use Mac's property at trial?

A. Yes, because the U.S. Marshal
was merely trying to bring fur-
ther proof to the aid of the gov-
ernment and was acting under
the color of his office.

B. Yes, because the circumstances
did not dictate that the U.S.
Marshal needed to secure a war-

Questions 53 — 54 are based on the
following facts:

Mac, a driver for Fed-Excess, was arrested,
without warrant, at his place of employment,
while waiting for his delivery truck to be
filled with packages. Other police officers
were simultaneously searching Mac's home,
having been let in by a neighbor who knew
where the key was kept. Inside, the officers
found and confiscated various incriminating
papers and articles, which they afterwards
turned over to the United States Marshal.

Later that evening, officers returned to
Mac's home with the Marshal, who thought
additional evidence could be seized. They
were let in by Mac's roommate, searched
the premises once more and carried away
incriminating letters and envelopes found in
a drawer. Mac was charged with use of the
mails for the purpose of transporting certain
coupons or tickets representing chances or
shares in a lottery or gift enterprise. Mac
urged the court for the return of his property
on the grounds that the papers had been
obtained without a search warrant and by
breaking into his home, in violation of the
Fourth and Fifth Amendments.

53. Should the court grant Mac's request

for the return of his property?

A. No, because the U.S. Marshal
was merely trying to bring fur-
ther proof to the aid of the Gov-
ernment and was acting under
the color of his office.

250 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

55. Ms. Riskay was disturbed from her
nightly TV watching by two Los An-
geles police officers who knocked on
her door and announced that they had
information "a large amount of child
pornography" was in Riskay's home.
The officers knocked on the front door
of the home and demanded entrance.
Riskay telephoned her attorney, was
advised not to let the officers inside
without a search warrant, and refused
to admit the officers.

Four hours later, five additional of-
ficers arrived on the scene, to join the
original officers who had subsequently
undertook a surveillance of Riskay's
house. The officers again sought en-
trance and, when Riskay did not come
immediately to the door, the door was
forcibly opened so the officers could
gain entrance.

Q

When the officers were inside, Riskay's
attorney arrived, but the officers did not
allow him to enter the house, nor speak
to Riskay. Riskay demanded to see a
search warrant, none was produced
and the officers continued to search
Riskay's residence. Irritated with Ris-
kay's repeated pleading to see a search
warrant, one of the officers forcibly
handcuffed Riskay. The officers ended
up searching Riskay's entire residence,
from bedrooms to bathrooms. Child
pornography was discovered during the
search. At trial, the prosecution did not
produce a search warrant, nor was their
failure to do so accounted for. Can the
child pornography found at Riskay's
residence be used at trial?

A. Yes, because in a prosecution in
a State court for a State crime the
Fourteenth Amendment does not
forbid the admission of evidence
obtained by an unreasonable
search and seizure.

B. Yes, because even if the officers'
search was unreasonable, they
were legitimately on the prem-
ises.

C. Yes, because child pornography

is inherently evil.

D. No, because the right to pri-
vacy is enforceable against the
States. 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 251

Q

57. Assume for the purpose of this question
only, that Dinah Gloss' breath was not
excessively minty, nor was she stopped
by officer Crumpky for speeding, but
was instead stopped because the rear
of her car was very low to the ground.
Suspecting that something illegal might
be in the trunk, Crumpky searched the
car and found 12 cases of cigarettes not
bearing California tax seals. The car and
cigarettes were seized and Gloss was
arrested and charged with violation of
California law. Crumpky had neither a
search nor an arrest warrant. Pursuant to
a California statute, a petition for forfei-
ture of the automobile was filed. Gloss,
by timely objection, seeks dismissal
of the forfeiture petition, claiming the
evidence was illegally obtained. Will
the forfeiture petition be dismissed?

A. Yes, because the seizure was
founded upon evidence illegally
obtained, since under the par-
ticular circumstances Crumpky
acted without probable cause.

B. No, because the inventory search
exception allows Crumpky to act
as he did.

C. No, because the exclusionary
rule does not apply to civil for-
feitures.

D. No, because contraband, once
seized, cannot be returned to its
owner.

Questions 56 — 57 are based upon
the following facts:

Dinah Gloss, a high-fashion model, late
for a photo session, was speeding, travel-
ing 50 mph, in a residential district. Officer
Crumpky, noticing the excessive speed,
pulled Gloss over. When Gloss rolled down
her window, Crumpky was overwhelmed
by the smell of breath mints. Gloss was
asked to step out of the car and perform a
field sobriety test. Gloss passed the test, but
Crumpky felt Gloss was probably an alco-
holic who was able to perform most daily
functions while intoxicated. In fact, he was
positive that's why the smell of breath mints
was so strong.

Believing there was probably a bottle of al-
cohol somewhere, Crumpky searched Gloss'
entire car. Under the driver's seat, he found
a baggy containing an 1/8 ounce of cocaine.
Gloss was arrested and taken immediately
to the station. Gloss' attorney files a motion
to suppress the evidence.

56. This motion will likely:

A. Fail, because the overwhelm-
ing smell of breath mints gave
Crumpky all the reason he need-
ed to search Gloss' car.

B. Fail, because cocaine was

found.

C. Fail, because of the inventory

exception.

D. Succeed.

Q

Questions 58 — 62 are based on the
following facts:

John Palmer, an off-duty police officer, was
playing golf one Sunday afternoon. His tee
shot on the fourth hole was a bad slice and
ended up out-of-bounds, in the backyard
of Mrs. Middo. Palmer climbed the hill to
Middo's backyard and began looking for
his golf ball, which was easy to do since
there was no fence to climb. While looking,
Palmer glanced into Middo's greenhouse
and saw several beautifully-manicured
marijuana plants inside. He also noticed, on
a workbench inside the greenhouse, three
ouzies. Suspicious, Palmer then proceeded
to go through two trash cans in the backyard.
In them, he found hundreds of baggies full
of marijuana. Based on what he found in the
backyard, Palmer ended his golf game early,
went to the nearby police station where he
worked and obtained a search warrant to
search Middo's greenhouse and home for
marijuana and drug-dealing paraphernalia.
The warrant Palmer procured lacked the
magistrate's signature because the magis-
trate inadvertently left his signature off the
form.

58. Was Palmer's discovery of the green-
house marijuana and the three ouzies
lawful?

A. No, because Palmer was off-duty

at the time.

B. No, because he had no probable
cause to enter Middo's back-
yard.

C. No, because he only had license
to look for his golfball and noth-
ing else.

D. Yes, because no significant pri-

vacy expectation was invaded.

59. The discovery of the hundreds of bag-
gies full of marijuana was unlawful
because:

A. No significant privacy expecta-

tion was invaded.

B. Palmer was presented with an

exigent circumstance.

C. Palmer acted in good faith.

D. None of the above.

60. Since the warrant had no signature, it

will be deemed:

A. Valid, because the magistrate
inadvertently left his signature
off.

B. Valid, even if the signature was
purposefully left off, as long as
the magistrate had all of the facts
before him when preparing the
warrant.

C. Valid.

D. Defective. 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 253

63. T.J. Booker ran a bookmaking operation
out of his print shop, located on the third
floor of an office building in downtown
Pennsylvania. An F.B.I. agent stood on
a tall ladder and used binoculars to see
inside the print shop's windows. From
this vantage point, the agent observed
gambling records. Did the F.B.I. agent
engage in a search by climbing on top
of a ladder and using binoculars?

A. Yes, because he had to climb a
ladder and use binoculars.

B. Yes, because the window wasn't

at street level.

C. No, because the third floor win-
dow to the print shop was open
to view.

D. Both A and B.

Q

61. If the warrant is deemed invalid after
Officer Palmer executes it, anything
found pursuant to that warrant will be:

A. Inadmissible, if Palmer acted on
the warrant with the knowledge
that it was invalid.

B. Inadmissible.

C. Admissible.

D. None of the above.

62. If Officer Palmer realizes the warrant
is defective because it lacks a signature
and executes it despite this knowledge,
anything found pursuant to the warrant
will be:

A. Admissible.

B. Admissible, only if the evidence
could have been found without
the issuance of a warrant.

C. Admissible, because Palmer's
findings while looking for his
golfball in Middo's backyard
were incriminating enough to
indicate that other contraband
would likely be discovered.

D. None of the above. 

254 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

64. Since he built the huge barn with four
30 foot walls, will the court find that
Johnny Potseed entertained a legitimate
expectation of privacy in the premises
or area searched?

A. Yes.

B. Yes, because an individual
doesn't have to contemplate the
possibility of an aircraft hovering
over their structure at an altitude
low enough to be able to see
inside the structure's rooftop.

C. Yes, because the construction
of the roof successfully denied
anyone adjacent to it, or paral-
lel to it, a view of the goings on
inside of it.

D. No, because the structure of the
roof made it like an open or un-
covered window.

Questions 64 — 66 are based on the
following facts:

Johnny Potseed built himself a huge barn
so he could grow pot without any of his
neighbors realizing what he was doing. The
barn had four walls, all of which were 30 feet
high. There were no windows in the walls
because Johnny didn't want anyone to be
able to see inside. Johnny didn't put a roof
on the barn so the sun could shine down on
his wonderful marijuana buds, making them
all the more potent.

Acting on a telephone tip from an anony-
mous pilot reporting the presence of mari-
juana growing within the four huge walls
of the barn, two police officers flew over
the premises in a state police helicopter. At
an altitude of approximately 500 feet above
the barn, the officers were unable to deci-
pher the exact kind of vegetation growing
in the barn. To get a better look, the officers
lowered their altitude to approximately 40
feet over the barn. From this distance, the
officers, trained and experienced in the aerial
detection of marijuana, were able to tell that
Johnny was growing marijuana. The officers
hovered over the barn for approximately 5
minutes before leaving the area.

On the basis of the officers' observations, a
search warrant was issued. With warrant in
hand, the police forcibly entered the barn
and observed close to 100 large marijuana
plants, 18-20 feet tall.  

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 255

66. Assume that Johnny Potseed had both
domestic and farm animals on his
property. When the police helicopters
hovered 40 feet above the property,
the loud noises and vibrations caused
by the helicopter's proximity, caused
Johnny's animals to go into a frenzy,
whereby they stampeded wildly around
the property. During this frenzy, half of
the animals died from shock. In fact, the
vibrations were so strong that a glass
cabinet full of china crashed to the floor
in the kitchen of Johnny's nearby home.
Johnny brings a cause of action against
the government for invasion of privacy.
Will he prevail?

A. Yes.

B. Yes, but only if the court decides
the conduct of the officers in fly-
ing at 40 feet above the barn was
hazardous to persons or property
on the surface.

C. No, because even though damage
to persons or property occurred,
the officers had a right to fly
above Johnny's property.

D. No, because Johnny's marijuana
crop was clear and visible.

65. Assume for the purpose of this ques-
tion only, that Johnny Potseed had a
roof on his huge barn, which he still
used for his marijuana growing. During
a rainstorm, the roof leaked. Johnny
contracted X-Cell Roofing to install
a new roof. X-Cell roofing acciden-
tally left a 20-square-foot portion of
the roof uncovered, though they told
Johnny, and believed so, that the roof
was completely installed. Believing the
roof was installed, Johnny left town
for a few days of rest and relaxation.
Upon arriving home, Johnny found his
marijuana crop being confiscated by
the police. Johnny was placed under
arrest and told that the marijuana had
been discovered in the same fashion it
had been discovered in question 64. At
trial, Johnny's lawyer made a motion to
suppress the marijuana on the grounds
that his client's privacy interests had
been violated. This motion will:

A. Succeed, because Johnny did not
deprive himself of his privacy.

B. Succeed, because Johnny con-
structed a roof on the barn so that
no one could see inside.

C. Fail, because the opening in the
roof negated any expectation
of privacy from the eyes of the
world or of the police.

D. None of the above. 

256 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Questions 67 — 68 are based on the
following facts:

Bob Dealin put his garbage at the curb in
front of his house on Sunday night because
the garbage men pick up the neighborhood's
garbage on Monday morning. Bob put his
trash in black trash bags and tied them se-
curely shut. He used black trash bags and
tied them securely shut because he didn't
want anybody to see what was inside the
bags nor be able to open them with ease. Bob
didn't want anybody messing with his trash
bags because Bob made his living dealing
hash to the neighboring colleges and much
of Bob's trash consisted of items indicative
of narcotic use and dealing.

One of Bob's neighbors notified the police
that she observed on many occasions several
vehicles make brief stops at the house during
the late-night and early-morning hours. The
police, based on the neighbor's information,
conducted a surveillance of Bob's home.
They, too, observed activity that indicated
potential drug dealing was taking place at
Bob's house.

One of the police officers asked the neigh-
borhood's regular trash collector to set aside
the bags from Bob's house without mixing
them with trash from any of the other resi-
dences. The trash collector did so and turned
the bags over to the officer, who promptly
looked through them. Items indicative of
narcotics use and drug dealing were found.
The officer was able to secure a search war-
rant to search Bob's home.

During the search of Bob's house, large
quantities of hash were discovered along
with drug-dealing paraphernalia. Bob was
arrested on felony narcotics charges. Bob's
attorney made a motion to suppress the evi-
dence, claiming the warrantless trash search
violated the Fourth Amendment.

67. The motion to suppress will:

A. Succeed, because the warrantless
search of Bob's trash violated the
Fourth Amendment.

B. Succeed, because Bob had placed
his trash in black trash bags,
which no one could see through,
and tied the bags securely shut,
indicating his expectation of
privacy.

C. Fail, because society would not
accept as reasonable Bob's claim
to an expectation of privacy.

D. Both A and B.

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

257

68. Assume for the purpose of this ques-
tion only, that Bob, because he was
getting ready to go out of town for a
couple days, had placed two opaque
trash bags, securely tied, just outside
his front door, containing two eight-
ounce bricks of hash and other legal
personal belongings. Bob was going
to take the bags with him on his trip.
A police officer, acting on a neighbor's
tip that drug dealing was likely tak-
ing place at Bob's house, walked up
to Bob's front porch and confiscated
the two black trash bags. Based on the
contents discovered therein, the officer
secured a search warrant for Bob's
home and found quantities of hash and
drug-dealing paraphernalia inside. Bob
files a motion to suppress the evidence
at trial. The motion would:

A. Succeed, because the warrant-
less search of Bob's black trash
bags violated the Fourth Amend-
ment.

B. Succeed, because the black trash
bags were being used to store or
transport personal possessions.

C. Fail.

D. Both A and B.

258 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

69. Sigmund Frodd, experiencing grave fi-
nancial difficulties, decided it was time
to cheat on his taxes. During 1994, he
did many fraudulent things in an effort
to get a refund from the government.
Frodd shredded all of the documents
he used to mastermind his fraudulent
activities because he didn't want any-
one to be able to figure out what he
had done. Frodd contemplated burning
the documents, but decided instead to
merely put the shreddings in the trash
because the documents had been virtu-
ally shredded beyond comprehension.

Frodd's tax return had been red-flagged
by the I.R.S. computer and two I.R.S.
agents had been sent to Frodd's house
to investigate. The agents searched
through garbage bags outside Frodd's
house and found them full of shredded
documents. The agents took the garbage
bags with them back to their headquar-
ters and proceeded to painstakingly
piece together the shredded documents.
Based upon the pieced-together docu-
ments, the I.R.S. was able to make a
case of tax fraud against Frodd. A mo-
tion to suppress the evidence would:

A. Succeed, because John shredded
the documents so no one could
read them.

B. Succeed, because the documents
in their shredded state were in no
way incriminating.

C. Fail. 

Q

D. Both A and B.

70. During their examination of a damaged
package, employees of Federal Excess
observed a white powdery substance,
originally concealed within eight lay-
ers of brown paper and tape. A federal
agent was summoned, who removed a
trace amount of the white substance,
subjected it to a test and determined that
it was cocaine. Did the federal agent's
field test constitute an unlawful search
or seizure within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment?

A. No.

B. Yes, because a protected posses-
sory interest was infringed.

C. Yes, because the field test like-
ly destroyed some of the evi-
dence.

D. Both B and C.

71. Ms. Prude mistakenly received a pack-
age containing apparently pornographic
videos. Since there were people en-
gaged in sexual acts on the video boxes,
Prude turned the videos over to F.B.I.
agents. The agents watched the videos
and were able to ascertain that they
were, in fact, pornographic. The agents
brought prosecution against the sender.
Did the F.B.I. agents need a warrant to
view the pornographic videos sent to
Prude by mistake?

A. No, because Prude, a private
party, opened the videos herself,
revealing the pornographic video
boxes.

B. No, because the video boxes
were obviously pornographic,
given the pictures of sexual acts
on the outside of them.

C. Yes, because the screening of
the films by the agents was a
governmental search.

D. Yes, because Prude did not watch

the videos. 

72. John Dough, a postal worker, opened
a suspicious-looking package with a
return address from Haight-Asbury
Street, in San Francisco. John was hop-
ing the package would contain some
black-tar hash, given the return address
and the fact it was to be delivered to a
nearby fraternity house. John took the
package home with him and discovered
12 grams of blonde hash instead of
black-tar. A little disappointed, John
smoked some to get in a better mood.
Unfortunately, John became extremely
paranoid, realized what he had done
was wrong and turned the hash over to
the F.B.I. the next morning. The agents
brought a prosecution action against
the sender. Are John Dough's actions
governed by the Fourth Amendment?

A. No, because John procured the

hash for his personal use.

74. Molly Made works for Weekend Inn, a
chain of motels, where she is a part of
the room-cleaning staff. While cleaning
room 237, Molly discovered a sizeable
amount of cocaine on the night stand.
Molly quickly walked to the motel's
donut shop where she told Officer
Winchell about the cocaine. Officer
Winchell followed Molly to room 237
and Molly let Winchell inside the room.
Winchell further searched the room and
found more cocaine and cocaine para-
phernalia. Winchell waited in the room
until the guest returned and arrested
him for possession of cocaine. Was the
consent to search given by Molly Made
valid?

A. Yes, if it was after check-out time

for room 237.

B. Yes, because a hotel clerk or
maid has apparent authority to
consent to the search of a guest's
room.

C. No, because a third party cannot

give consent.

D. None of the above. 

B. Yes, because John is a postal

worker.

C. Yes, because John discovered
the hash during the course and
scope of his government employ-
ment.

D. Yes, because John's search and
seizure was done to further a
governmental objective.

73. The police were looking for Tom Hoss,
a bookmaking kingpin. Two officers
drove to Tom's house, thinking he
might be home, to ask him some ques-
tions concerning the recent murder of a
jockey. They knocked on the door and
Tom's butler answered the door, obvi-
ously intoxicated, reeking of martinis.
"May we come in?" one of the officers
asked. "Yes, you may," the Butler said,
with obviously-slurred speech. Did the
officers obtain voluntary consent?

A. No, if the officers knew that the

butler was drunk.

B. No, if the officers did not know

the butler was drunk.

C. Yes.

D. Both A and B.

Q

75. Mary Jane was a college student who
dealt drugs to make ends meet. One
night, while weighing her latest ship-
ment, there was a knock on Mary
Jane's door. "Who is it?" she asked.
"The police! Open up!" Mary peered
through the peep-hole: it was the police.
"Sorry, but I can't let you in." "You'd
better! We have a search warrant!"
Flustered, Mary let the police inside.
Three of them bolted through the door
and thoroughly searched Mary's apart-
ment, finding two pounds of marijuana,
scales and other items indicating drug
use and drug dealing.

During the search, Mary asked, "May
I see the search warrant, please?" The
officers all started laughing. One of
them said, "We have no search war-
rant, you dumb broad!" Shocked, Mary
screamed, "But that's the only reason I
let you in!" "Oh well," one of the of-
ficers shrugged. Did the officers obtain
valid consent to enter and search Mary's
apartment?

A. Yes, because the search incrimi-

nated Mary.

B. Yes, because securing a search
warrant is a mere formality
when the officers have probable
cause.

C. Yes, if all three officers thought
one of the other officers had a
search warrant.

D. No.     

Questions 76 — 77 are based on the
following facts:

David Malcolm served a three-year sentence
for burglary and upon his release from an
Idaho prison was placed on a five-year
probation period. A condition of his proba-
tion was that he agree in advance to waive
certain Fourth Amendment rights. Malcolm
attached his signature to the following:

"That probationer does hereby agree and
consent to the search of his person, automo-
bile, real property, and any other property
at any time and at any place by any law
enforcement officer, peace officer, probation
officers, and does waive his constitutional
right to be free from such searches."

Later, when officers obtained information
that Malcolm was fencing stolen goods, they
went to his home and searched it without a
warrant while he was out of town, and found
large amounts of stolen goods.

76. The probation condition will be

found:

A. Invalid, because an individual
cannot sign away his constitu-
tional rights.

B. Invalid, because there is implied
coercion involved when making
a probationer consent in advance
to surrender his constitutional
rights.

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 261

C. Invalid, because such a broadly
worded probation condition
could lead to invasions of pri-
vacy of innocent third parties.

D. Valid.

77. Assume the same facts as question 76,
except the above clause is not a condi-
tion of Malcolm's probation. Will the
police officer's search of Malcolm's
home be upheld?

A. No, because the police en-
tered Malcolm's home without
a search warrant.

B. No, because Malcolm was out of
town and could not consent to the
search.

C. Yes, because, under the cir-
cumstances, it can be deemed a
"regulatory search."

D. Both A and B.

262 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Questions 78 — 81 are based on the
following facts:

Officer Bust posed as a drug purchaser and
gained entry into the home of Tommy Dealer,
who ran a crack house in south Central L.A.
When inside, Bust witnessed several drug
sales take place. Tommy was arrested and
charged with possession and sale of crack
cocaine. Tommy's lawyer made a motion
to suppress the evidence because Bust had
gained entry by tricking Tommy.

78. This motion will:

A. Succeed, because Bust misrep-

resented his identity.

B. Succeed, because Bust's entry
was not consensual, since he
tricked Tommy.

C. Fail, because Bust posed as a

drug purchaser.

D. Fail, because Tommy allowed

Bust to enter his home.

79. Assume for the purpose of this ques-
tion only, that Bust gained entry into
Tommy's home in the manner he did
in question 78. Rather than witness
drug transactions taking place, Bust
took the opportunity while Tommy
was in the bathroom to look into closed
drawers and envelopes, finding cocaine
and cocaine paraphernalia. Tommy's
lawyer made a motion to suppress this
evidence. The motion will: 

A. Fail, because Bust posed as a

drug purchaser.

B. Succeed, because Bust looked
into closed drawers and enve-
lopes while Tommy was in the
bathroom.

C. Succeed, because Bust concealed
his status as a law enforcement
officer.

D. Fail, because Tommy left the
room, thus giving Bust implied
consent to search the closed
drawers and envelopes.

80. Assume for the purpose of this question
only, that Officer Bust gained entry into
Tommy's home by pretending to be
a telephone technician. Once inside,
Bust witnessed drug transactions taking
place. Tommy's lawyer made a motion
to suppress the evidence. The motion
will:

A. Succeed, because Bust did not
represent himself as having an
illegal purpose.

B. Fail, because Bust posed as a

telephone technician.

C. Fail, because Bust did not make
any additional intrusions into the
premises of Tommy.

D. Fail.

Q

81. Assume for the purpose of this ques-
tion only, that Bust gained entry into
Tommy's home by telling Tommy he
was looking for an escaped convict,
who broke out of the nearby State peni-
tentiary. Actually, Bust was looking to
bust Tommy. Once inside, Bust saw a
sizeable lump of cocaine, on a mirror,
on Tommy's coffee table. Tommy's
lawyer made a motion to suppress the
evidence because Bust used deceptive
practices to gain entry into Tommy's
home. The motion will:

A. Succeed, because Bust misrep-

resented his purpose. 

B. Succeed, because Bust did not
represent himself as having an
illegal purpose.

C. Fail, because Tommy's consent

was voluntary.

D. Fail.

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 263

  
83. Officer Jones was driving his patrol car
down Sunset Blvd., looking for Tim
Johnson, a suspect wearing blue jeans
and a lime-green t-shirt, who just robbed
a coin store. Jones spotted a man wear-
ing blue jeans and a lime-green t-shirt,
walking briskly down the boulevard.
Jones sped up, got out of his patrol car
and accosted the man who he thought
was Johnson. With gun drawn, Jones
instructed the suspect to put his hands
over his head. "What's this all about?"
Johnson asked. "You know what it's
all about," Jones replied. "Don't tell
me you don't know anything about the
coin shop you just robbed, Mr. John-
son." "I'm not Johnson." "Yeah, right,"
replied Jones. Jones searched through
the pockets of the suspect and found a
vile of cocaine and a metal straw, but
didn't find any coins or any items sold
in a coin shop.

"Where'd you stash the coins, John-
son?" "I'm not Johnson. My name is
Howard Limbo. I'm on my way to catch
the bus." Jones allowed the suspect
to produce his driver's license. The
suspect was not lying, his name was
Howard Limbo. Nonetheless, Officer
Jones handcuffed Limbo and drove him
to the coin shop, hopefully to be identi-
fied by the coin shop's owner.

Q

82. Officers Starsky and Hooch had secured
a warrant to search the person of For-
rest Dump and his place of residence
known as "8709 Portapotty Place, fifth
floor apartment." Starsky and Hooch
reasonably believed that there was
only one fifth floor apartment at 8709
Portapotty Place. In fact, there were two
apartments located on the fifth floor, one
belonging to Dump and the other to a
man named Peter Walk. Before the of-
ficers realized there were two fifth floor
apartments, they had entered Walk's
apartment, thinking it was Dump's, and
found two kilos of hash on the dining
room table, next to a drug scale.

Walk was subsequently arrested for
possession of narcotics with intent to
sell. Walk's attorney filed a motion to
suppress the evidence because the of-
ficers had entered the premises without
a search warrant. The motion will:

A. Succeed, because the warrant

will be found defective.

B. Succeed, because the officers
searched the wrong residence.

C. Succeed, because the officers
should have investigated further
to determine if there was only
one fifth floor apartment.

D. Fail. 

264 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

"No, that's not the guy," says the owner
of the coin shop. "Wearing similar
clothes, but that's not him." Officer
Jones arrested Limbo for possession
of cocaine. Limbo's attorney made a
motion to suppress the evidence. The
motion will:

A. Fail.	

B. Succeed, because Officer Jones

detained the wrong man.

C. Succeed, because Officer Jones
had no reason to search the pock-
ets of Howard Limbo.

D. Succeed, because the owner of
the coin shop proved Howard
Limbo's innocence.

84. Officer Thomas and Officer Hill secured
a warrant on June 1,1994, to search the
premises of Robert Biden. Innundated
with paper work and other law enforce-
ment matters, Thomas and Hill were
unable to act on the warrant until July
7,1994. Once they did execute the war-
rant, however, they were able to seize
the anticipated cocaine from Biden's
apartment. Biden was arrested for pos-
session of cocaine. Biden's lawyer filed
a motion to suppress the evidence. The
motion will:

A. Succeed, because the officers
acted on the warrant on July 7,
1994.

Q

B. Fail, unless the warrant was ex-

ecuted in daytime hours.

C. Fail, because the facts do not
indicate the warrant lacked the
necessary judicial/magistrate
signature or seal. 

D. Succeed only if the warrant had

not expired.

Questions 85 — 88 are based upon
the following facts:

D. Fail, provided this was deemed

a legitimate exigency.

86. Assume for the purpose of this question
only, that Stonelli was home when the
officers arrived and they were able to
handcuff him without incident, in his
living room. Knowing that Stonelli was
"armed and dangerous," the officers
feared there could be armed and danger-
ous associates of Stonelli elsewhere in
the house. The officers looked through
large mahogany cabinets in the living
room as well as closets in an imme-
diately adjoining hallway, fearing at-
tackers could likely be present. During
their search, they found large amounts
of cocaine. Stonelli's lawyer makes a
motion to suppress the cocaine. The
motion will:

A. Succeed, because the officers did

not have probable cause.

B. Succeed, because the officers did
not have reasonable suspicion.

C. Both A and B.

D. Fail.

Officers Kent, Camel and Kool had a warrant
for the arrest of J.J. Stonelli, a Mafia hitman,
with a known propensity for extreme vio-
lence. It was known that Stonelli stockpiled
automatic weapons in his home, to protect
his large cache of heroin, cocaine and hash.
In fact, Stonelli was listed in police files as
"armed and dangerous."

Officers Kent, Camel and Kool quietly ap-
proached Stonelli's home and busted down
the front door, giving no notice or warning
to Stonelli or anyone else inside the house.
They bolted through the house, found large
amounts of drugs and illegal assault rifles,
while Stonelli was in the shower with his pet
poodle. Stonelli was arrested for possession
of narcotic and illegal assault rifles. At trial,
Stonelli's lawyer made a motion to suppress
the evidence.

85. The motion will:

A. Succeed, because the officers
did not give notice of their au-
thority and purpose for entering
Stonelli's home.

B. Succeed, because the police un-
necessarily broke down the front
door to gain entry.

C. Succeed, because the actions of
the officers could have lead to
unnecessary violence and en-
dangered the lives of innocent
people. 

266 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

	
	
87. Assume the same facts as question 86,
except the officers searched Stonelli's
entire home, looking under every bed
and opening all cabinets, cupboards and
closets. During their extensive search,
the officers found large amounts of
cocaine under the bed in the master
bedroom. Stonelli's lawyer makes a
motion to suppress the evidence. The
motion will:

A. Succeed, because the officers
did not have probable cause to
search the entire premises.

B. Succeed, because the officers did
not have reasonable suspicion to
search the entire premises.

C. Fail, if a reasonably prudent of-
ficer would believe that a danger-
ous individual was harbored in
the house.

D. Fail, because the actions of the
officers exceeded what was law-
ful.

88. Assume for the purpose of this question
only, that the officers applied for a war-
rant to search Stonelli's house for weap-
ons and stolen property, but the warrant
as signed by the magistrate authorized
only to search for stolen property. The
officers executing the warrant did not
find any stolen property but found the
weapons in plain view. Stonelli's lawyer
made a motion to suppress the weapons.
The motion will:

the fact they applied for a war-
rant indicating weapons.

C. Succeed, because the weapons
were not discovered "inadver-
tently" for the plain view doc-
trine to apply, given the fact the
officers applied for a warrant
indicating weapons.

D. Fail, because it was a valid

search.

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

III. Reasonable.

A. I and II only.

B. III only.

C. I, II, and III.

D. II and III only.

91. Assume for the purpose of this ques-
tion only, that the officers temporar-
ily detained the customers of the bar
while they conducted their search of
the premises. Such an action would be
deemed:

I. Coercive.

II. A violation of the Due

Process Clause.

III. Unconstitutional.

A. I only.

B. II and III only.

C. I, II and III.

D. None of the above.

Questions 89 — 91 are based on the
following facts: 

Three officers executed a valid warrant
to search for drugs in a neighborhood bar
known for drug use. Once lawfully inside the
bar, the officers began searching customers
of the bar for drugs. The officers searched
pockets, purses and wallets for any indicia
of drugs.

89. The search of the customers was:

A. Lawful, because people who
frequent a bar known for drug
use are likely to have drugs on
their person.

B. Lawful, because the officers
searched pockets, purses and
wallets.

C. Unlawful, because the officers
had no probable cause to arrest
the customers.

D. Unlawful because the search
warrant only allowed the officers
to search the bar, not the personal
effects of the customers.

90. Assume for the purpose of this ques-
tion only, that the officers frisked the
customers for weapons. Such an action
would be deemed:

I. A Fourth Amendment

right violation.

II. An invasion of privacy. 

268 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

    
Q

Questions 92 — 93 are based on the
following facts:

Police officers were sent to a downstairs
apartment where a man lay wounded from
a gunshot wound. The officers determined
that the bullet was shot from the upstairs
apartment as there was a hole in the ceiling
of the downstairs apartment consistent with
a bullet hole. The officers lawfully entered
the upstairs apartment to search for the
shooter, weapons and other victims. When
inside the apartment, the officers found a
rifle, a case of bullets as well as a discarded
shell. One of the officers also noticed an
expensive CD player which didn't fit in with
the ill-furnished apartment or the poverty-
stricken neighborhood. Thinking it might be
stolen, he moved it away from the wall so
he could read the serial number. He wrote
the serial numbers down and realized they
matched a CD player that had been stolen in
a recent armed robbery. The officer seized
the CD player and the apartment's owner
was charged with discharging a firearm in
city limits and possession of stolen goods.
In fact, discovery of the CD player led to
the apartment owner's arrest for the recent
armed robbery.

92. Was the officer's conduct concerning

the CD player lawful?

A. Yes, because the officers lawfully

entered the apartment.

B. Yes, because recording the se-
rial numbers did not constitute a
seizure.

C. Yes, because the presence of
an expensive CD player in an
ill-furnished apartment in a
poverty-stricken neighborhood
was a proper basis for reasonable
suspicion.

D. None of the above.

93. Assume for the purpose of this question
only, that one of the officers found and
seized a box of pen guns in plain view.
Later, at the station, it was determined
that these pen guns, which look exactly
like ballpoint pens to the naked eye,
were in fact contraband (weapons). Was
the seizure of the pen guns lawful?

I. Yes, because they were
discovered in plain
view.

II. Yes, because they were
later determined to be
contraband.

III. No, because they were
later determined to be
contraband.

A. I

B. I and II

C. III

D. None of the above.

Questions 94 — 98 are based upon
the following facts:

Assume the following facts for the purpose
of this question only: Johnny Boy ran a red
light late one night and was pulled over
by Officer 0' Hair. Johnny was asked to
step out of the car because his pupils were
dilated and he was talking extremely fast.
O'Hair suspected cocaine use. Johnny failed
a field sobriety test and was taken back to
the police station. There, Johnny agreed to
waive his Miranda rights and talk to Officer
O'Hair and another officer. Johnny, however,
insisted that nothing be put in writing and
requested that all tape recorders be turned
off. Johnny also indicated that he would not
make a written statement outside the pres-
ence of counsel. Johnny proceeded to make
incriminating statements.

94. Should Johnny's incriminating state-

ments be suppressed?

A. No, because the questioning was
consistent with the Fifth Amend-
ment.

B. Yes, because when Johnny
requested that none of his state-
ments be put in writing or tape-
recorded, the officers should
have realized that Johnny didn't
understand that his statements
could be used as evidence even if
not written down or recorded.

C. Yes, because Johnny's waiver
of his Miranda rights was con-
ditioned.

270 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

D. Yes, because Johnny indicated
he would not make a written
statement outside the presence
of counsel.

95. Assume for the purpose of this ques-
tion only, that nine police officers had
lawfully entered Johnny Boy's house
at 3:00 a.m. and questioned him in his
own bedroom, without reading him the
Miranda warnings. During this ques-
tioning session, Johnny made several
incriminating statements. Should the
officers have read Johnny Boy his Mi-
randa rights?

A. No, because he was not being
questioned at the police station.

B. No, because a suspect cannot be
in custody in his own home.

C. Yes, because there were nine
officers in Johnny Boy's bed-
room.

D. Yes, because a reasonable person
would have believed this was an
interrogation.

96. Assume for the purpose of this ques-
tion only, that Johnny Boy accepted an
invitation from a police officer to come
down to the police station for question-
ing, but was not under arrest. Would
Johnny be deemed to be in custody?

A. Yes, because the questioning
took place at the police station. 

B. Yes, because Johnny was invited

by a police officer.

C. No, unless the invitation ap-
peared to be a kind of offer
that could not be reasonably
refused.

D. No, because Johnny was not

under arrest.

97. Assume for the purpose of this ques-
tion only, that Johnny Boy was pulled
over by Officer 0' Hair under suspicion
of drunk driving. Officer O'Hair pro-
ceeded to ask Johnny Boy a series of
questions, trying to ascertain whether
he had been drinking, how much he had
been drinking and when he had his last
drink. Would Officer O'Hair's ques-
tioning of Johnny Boy be considered
custodial interrogation?

A. Yes, because Officer O'Hair is a

police officer.

B. Yes, because Officer O'Hair

detained Johnny Boy.

C. No, because Johnny Boy was not

arrested.

D. No, but only if O'Hair knew
Johnny had been drinking.

98. Bob Youbanks, on a hot night in the
summer of 1994, engaged by himself
in a series of armed robberies in the
state of Columbia. Youbanks, a home-
less entrepreneur, sold wedding dresses
at the local swap meet every weekend
and, low on inventory, he decided to rob
five bridal supply shops. The victims,
in each case, were the business owners
who were forced to hand over three
designer wedding gowns at gun point.
At two of the stores, Youbanks fired his
handgun, severely injuring four custom-
ers. In fact, one customer was purpose-
fully shot and killed by Youbanks.

Columbia state law provides that when
a defendant pleads guilty, "the court
must cause the punishment to be de-
termined by a jury" and may "cause
witnesses to be examined, to ascertain
the character of the offense."

Before the matter came to trial, the
court determined that Youbanks was
indigent. He was provided with a public
defender. A week later, at his arraign-
ment, Youbanks pleaded guilty to all six
offenses. Youbanks was found guilty of
all counts, based on credible eye-wit-
ness testimony, and sentenced to death
by electrocution.

On automatic appeal, it was discovered,
as indicated in the record, that the judge
did not ask Youbanks any questions
concerning his plea, and Youbanks did
not in any way address the court. Can
Youbank's conviction be reversed? 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 271

Later, at the plea hearing, Astro af-
firmed that he fully understood the
plea statement and the consequences
of signing his name on the document.
The judge accepted Astro 's guilty plea
and sentenced him according to the
state's recommendation: 20 years for
the murder and 5 years for the theft.
Astro was credited with the time he
had already served in prison. The judge
advised Astro that he would be required
to serve at least one-third of the murder
sentence before he would be eligible
for parole.

Almost three years later, Astro filed a
federal habeas corpus petition alleging
that his guilty plea was involuntary
because his court-appointed attorney
informed him, just as the judge did, that
he would be eligible for parole after
serving one-third of the murder sen-
tence. In fact, because Astro had been
convicted of a separate felony more
than five years ago, he was classified
as a "second offender," under Colum-
bia state law, he would be required to
serve one-half of the murder sentence
before being eligible for parole. Astro
has asked the Columbia Court of Ap-
peals to reduce his sentence to a term of
years that would result in his becoming
eligible for parole in conformance with
his original plea-bargain expectations.
Will Astro be granted relief? 

A. Yes, because he was denied due

process of law.

B. No, because he was found guilty
based on credible eye-witness
testimony.

C. No, because he pleaded guilty.

D. No, because there cannot be
reversible error when the defen-
dant admits guilt.

99. Billy Astro pleaded guilty to charges
of first-degree murder and theft of
property. Under Columbia state law,
the murder charge carried a potential
sentence of 15 to 50 years or life in
prison. Astro 's court-appointed attorney
successfully negotiated a plea bargain
with the state, where Astro would plead
guilty to both charges, if the State would
impose concurrent prison sentences of
20 years for the murder and 5 years for
the theft. Astro signed a plea agreement
indicating that he understood the charg-
es against him and the consequences of
pleading guilty, and that his pleas had
not been induced by "force, fear, threat,
promise or intimidation." He affixed
his signature below the last two lines
of the plea agreement, which read: "I
fully understand this document. I fully
understand what my rights are, and I
voluntarily plead guilty and realize the
consequences of so doing."

272 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

A. No, if Astro did not allege in his
habeas petition that he would
have pleaded not guilty and
insisted on going to trial, had he
been correctly informed about
his parole eligibility date.

B. Yes, because the court-appointed
attorney's constitutionally inef-
fective performance affected the
outcome of the plea bargaining
process.

C. Yes, because Astro's guilty plea
was not voluntary and intelli-
gent.

D. Yes, because Astro had a mis-
taken belief as to when he would
become eligible for parole.

Q

100. Robert Rotten was indicted on two
felony counts of bookmaking. After
negotiations, Rotten's attorney was
able to persuade the district attorney to
allow his client to plead to a lesser-in-
cluded offense, which carried a maxi-
mum sentence of one year in prison,
upon conviction. The district attorney
also agreed to make no recommenda-
tions as to length of sentence. Rotten
subsequently entered his plea of guilty
to the lesser offense. Rotten explained
to the sentencing judge that his plea
was voluntary and he understood
all implications of pleading guilty.
Rotten's plea was accepted and a date
for sentencing was set. Later, Rotten's
attorney had discovered that evidence
to be used against his client had been
illegally seized, and immediately
moved to withdraw the guilty plea.
The motion was denied.

The court then turned to consideration
of the sentence. At this proceeding,
a new and different prosecutor rec-
ommended that Rotten be given the
maximum one-year sentence. Rotten's
attorney immediately objected to this
because Rotten had been promised
that no sentencing recommendations
would be made. The sentencing judge
proceeded to impose the maximum
one-year sentence, claiming that the
prosecutor's recommendation had no
influence whatsoever on his decision.
Should Rotten be allowed to withdraw
his guilty plea? 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 273

Q    

A. Yes, because the earlier plea did
not irrevocably waive Rotten's
federal constitutional right to a
trial.

B. No, because the judge was not
influenced by the prosecutor's
recommendation.

C. No, because a plea cannot rest
on a promise or agreement of the
prosecutor.  

D. Both B and C.   

END OF QUESTIONS 

274 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
ANSWERS 

1. C is the correct answer. Choices I and II
are correct because Mick has no reason-
able expectation of privacy in the area
searched, here a public place, since he
abandoned the property. Had Mick been
seized, the answer would have been dif-
ferent. That is, his abandonment of the
marijuana was the "fruit" of the illegal
seizure. But, in California v. Hodari
D. (1991), it was held that there is no
seizure unless there is actual restraint
or a submission to police authority.
There was none here. Thus, C, which
includes choice I, II and III is the correct
answer.

2. A is the best answer. Note: The call of
this question is phrased in the negative.
A is clearly worse because the Bail
Clause was never made state-appli-
cable; thus, it is a very bad answer. B,
though amorphous, may be correct. Due
Process might offer Marie some protec-
tion. Since there was impermissible
delay in appearing before a judge after
the warrantless arrest (48 hours is the
maximum delay allowed — See  County
of Riverside v. McLaughlin (1991)), C
is a correct statement, which makes it
incorrect under this call. Since Marie
may have been entrapped, choice D is
not as bad as choice A (which is clearly
wrong).

A

3 . A is the correct answer. A civil suit
requires a violation of rights and bad
faith on the part of the officer. There
was a Fourth Amendment violation here
because Marie was held over 48 hours
before seeing a judge. See McLaughlin,
supra. However, since the officer may
have had nothing to do with the delay,
and since good faith is a defense, there
may not be damages. B, C and D are
incorrect for the same reasons that A is
correct.

4. D is the correct answer. An individual
need not be told of her right to refuse
a search, provided there was no police
coercion. The test for consent is simply
voluntariness under the totality of the
circumstances. A similar fact-pattern
occurred in Florida v. Bostick (1991),
and the consent theregiven was deemed
valid. A is incorrect because often war-
rants are not needed in order to search.
B is incorrect because exigency is not
the only exception to the warrant re-
quirement. C is incorrect because the
auto exception requires probable cause
of contraband in the auto, and there was
none here.

5. D is the best answer. It is lawful to stop a
car when the driver is speeding. Choice
A is correct because a traffic stop is a
detention — but D is more specific and
is, thus, a better answer. A traffic stop
is not considered to be an arrest, so B
is incorrect. See Berkemer v. McCarty 
(1980). C is incorrect for the same rea-
sons that D is correct. 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 275

8. C is the correct answer. Unlike the Fifth
Amendment Miranda prophylactic
right to counsel, the Sixth Amendment
counsel right (which attaches at formal
charging) is offense specific. McNeil v. 
Wisconsin (1991). Since the theft was
stipulated to be unrelated to the forg-
ery, the interrogation was permissible.
A and B are incorrect because the fact
that the interrogation was not in-person
and voluntary are not entirely relevant.
D is incorrect for the same reason that
C is correct.

9. A is the correct answer. When an at-
torney misses the filing deadline of an
appeal of right, ineffective counsel is
presumed. Lozada v. Deeds (1991).
Although Strickland ordinarily requires
prejudice to the verdict, such is not
necessary in this one instance. Thus,
B is incorrect. Since all attorneys are
state-licensed, it is irrelevant that Rex
was privately retained. Thus, C is incor-
rect. D is incorrect because collateral
appeal is allowed on this issue. See
Strickland v. Washington (1984).

10. D is the correct answer. The U.S. Su-
preme Court has ruled that "victim
impact" statements are permissible.
Payne v. Tennessee (1991). Thus, A,  B
and C are incorrect. 

6. B is the correct answer. Although it may
be argued that Acid's consent was not
voluntary since he was stopped, consent
has been broadly construed by the U.S.
Supreme Court. See United States v. 
Mendenhall (1984). Moreover, an argu-
ment that the consent was invalid was
not an option provided in the answers.
Thus, given that the consent was vol-
untary, the issue then becomes was the
officer permitted to search into a closed
container. Florida v. Jimeno (1991) is
directly on point and indicates such to
be permissible. A is incorrect for the
same reasons that B is correct. C is in-
correct because a traffic stop is not an
arrest. D is incorrect because, although
it may appear otherwise, there is no
drug exception to the warrant require-
ment.

7. A is the correct answer. Once there is
probable cause of contraband in a car,
the whole car can be searched — includ-
ing the search of closed containers. See
California v. Acevedo (1991). Here,
there was probable cause based on the
drugs in the passenger compartment.
B is incorrect because the search inci-
dent to arrest exception does not allow
search into the trunk of a car. See New
York v. Belton (1981). Since there was
no immediate danger or hot pursuit, C
is incorrect. D is incorrect because there
is no recognized drug exception to the
warrant requirement.

276 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

11. C is the correct answer because it
includes choices I, II and III, which
are all necessary to satisfy an Eighth
Amendment claim by a prisoner. See
Wilson v. Seiter (1991). Choices I and
II require the treatment of a prisoner to
be both cruel and unusual, following
the language of the Eighth Amend-
ment. (Thus, incidentally, mere over-
crowding, although cruel, may not be
unusual.) Choice III requires intent on
the part of the warden or the claim will
fail.

12. D is the best answer. Choice A, B and
C all describe aspects of the Fourth
Amendment. However, habeas claims
cannot include Fourth Amendment ar-
guments; so these choices are clearly
wrong. Stone v. Powell (1976). Al-
though the Eighth Amendment claim
will also be difficult, it has a chance of
success — so D is the best answer.

13. A is the correct answer. Prisoners enjoy
no Fourth Amendment rights, because
of the vastly reduced expectation of pri-
vacy in prison and the need for safety.
Bell v. Wolfish (1979). Although argu-
ments of Due Process (choice B), Equal
Protection (choice C), and Cruel and
Unusual Punishment (choice D) may
not succeed, they at least have such a
possibility.

A

14. B is the correct answer. Although il-
legally seized evidence cannot be used
in the case-in-chief, such can be used
to impeach. United States v. Havens,
(1980). Since the impeachment was
proper, it necessarily follows that an-
swers A, C and D are incorrect.

15. C is the correct answer. Provided that the
legislature so intended, a life-sentence
for a first-time drug offense does not
violate the Cruel and Unusual Punish-
ment Clause. See Harmelin v. Michigan
(1991). In this case, the Supreme Court
severely limited the traditional notion of
proportionality. Thus, choice A is incor-
rect. B is incorrect because lenity is a
term demanding ambiguous statutes to
be construed favorably to the defense.
Such is irrelevant to these facts. Choice
D is incorrect per the pronouncement of
Harmelin, above.

16. C is the best answer. On the facts given,
one might ask why was Wilbur allowed
to take the stand? Shouldn't he have
been told of the danger of impeach-
ment? Although the facts do not indi-
cate that he was not told, nevertheless
counsel's representation is suspect.
Since the standard of ineffectiveness
of counsel is not "farce and mockery,"
A is incorrect. See Strickland v. Wash-
ington (1984). Since no facts indicate
the judge to be biased, B is incorrect.
Since, as indicated in the previous an-
swer, sentences can be quite long and
constitutional, D is incorrect.         

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 277            

a.

17. B is the correct answer. This question
requires a fair reading of the facts.
Obviously Minko's threat of violence,
"find yourself bleeding," makes the
interrogation coercive. Thus, C and D
are incorrect. Since there was no public
safety then at issue, the exception of-
fered in choice A is irrelevant. Cf. New
York v. Quarles (1984).

18. A is the correct answer. Under Arizona
v. Fulminante (1991), the Supreme
Court has held that even confessions
that are coerced can be subject to harm-
less error analysis. B is incorrect for the
same reasons that A is correct. Since
Russ is not a member of a suspect class,
and no facts indicated any other Equal
Protection issue, C is clearly wrong. D
is incorrect because Russ' confession
has absolutely nothing to do with his
own rights of confrontation.

19. D is the best answer. In order for there
to be a violation of the right to effective
counsel, there must be attorney error
and prejudice. Strickland v. Washing-
ton, (1984). On these facts, there was
almost certainly attorney error (not
making an objection to the admission),
but no facts indicate prejudice. Thus, D
is phrased correctly, and A is incorrect.
Since no facts whatsoever indicate an
issue of suspect class, choices B and C
are incorrect.

278 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

20. C is the correct answer. If a contempora-
neous objection is not made (i.e., an ob-
jection contemporaneous to the alleged
error), a successful collateral petition
must show that there was good cause
for the failure (for example, conceal-
ment of evidence by the prosecution)
and prejudice to the verdict; and that
the defendant is, in fact, innocent of the
crime based on a Constitutional error.
Only choice C offers this alternative
phrasing.

21. D is the correct answer. There is no
Fourth Amendment protection if there
was no "search." Viewing a barn is not
a search, since no significant privacy
expectation was invaded. United States
v. Dunn (1987). Since there was no
emergency, A is incorrect. Since no
warrant was obtained initially, the good
faith exception (choice B) is incorrect.
Since J.G.'s "search" was not related to
public safety, choice C is incorrect.

22. D is the best answer. Although the facts
do not indicate whether the dumpster
was outside the home, a fair reading
of the facts so indicates. Thus, under
California v. Greenwood (1988), there
was no "search" for Fourth Amendment
purposes. Although this answer may not
necessarily be "correct," it is the best
answer because choices A, B and C
are clearly wrong. A is wrong because
there was no emergency. B is wrong
because the good faith exception is
not applicable to warrantless searches.
Choice C is wrong because this was not
a public safety search.  

23. A is the correct answer. Warrants require
judicial/magistrate approval and such is
either by signature or seal. B is incor-
rect because J.G's discoveries were not
protected by the Fourth Amendment,
since they were not "searches." C is
incorrect because warrants definitely
need judicial approval. D is incorrect
because, although the fruits of a search
performed in good faith reliance on a
warrant later deemed defective does not
require suppression of that evidence,
the warrant, itself, is nevertheless still
defective.

24. B is the correct answer. Good faith reli-
ance on a warrant later deemed defec-
tive does not mandate suppression of
the evidence obtained. Massachusetts 
v. Sheppard (1984). Although A is
legally correct, it misreads the facts.
This signatureless warrant was invalid.
Although C is legally correct, it is es-
sentially irrelevant since no statute was
stated in the facts. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that B is correct.

25. D is the correct answer. In order to
utilize the good faith exception to the
exclusionary rule, the officer must be
in objective good faith. Since both his
actual knowledge and his training in-
dicate "bad faith," this exception is not
available. Massachusetts v. Sheppard
(1984). Thus, A is incorrect. B is incor-
rect because no evidence whatsoever
indicates that the evidence would have
been discovered. C is incorrect because
there is no evidence whatsoever of any
independent source or sources.

A

26. A is the correct answer. Under the Wong
Sun rule, since the seizure of the car was
unlawful, the evidence so discovered is
to be suppressed. B is incorrect because
the exclusionary rule is applicable to
misdemeanors. C is incorrect because
the inventory exception requires lawful
police possession of the property. D is
incorrect because the good faith excep-
tion requires there to be a warrant.

27. B is correct. An officer can enter a
dwelling, if he has probable cause
that there is an emergency. A scream
furnishes such a reasonable belief. A
is incorrect because good faith alone,
without a warrant, is not a recognized
exception. C is incorrect because in no
way did Sarah or her guest consent. D
is incorrect for the same reason that B
is correct. Cf. Welsh v. Wisconsin

28. D is the best answer. Naked eye sur-
veillance, when the officer is lawfully
positioned is not a search for Fourth
Amendment purposes. Cf. California
v. Ciraolo (1986). A is incorrect be-
cause the observation was not related
to the apparent exigency. B is incorrect
because neither Sarah nor her guest
consented/assumed the risk. C is in-
correct because the brass case was not
"obviously incriminating." Cf. Arizona
v. Hicks (1987).

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 279

32. B is the correct answer. The Skinner
and Von Raab cases (1989) indicate be-
cause of the widespread drug problem
and public safety, testing of railroad
employees associated with an accident
and customs agents seeking promotion
to be lawful, under the administrative
exception. By logical analogy, police
officer testing is most probably accept-
able. A is incorrect because there is no
drug exception to the warrant require-
ment. C is incorrect because there was
no emergency. D is incorrect because
examination of bodily fluids is both a
search and a seizure. Skinner v. Railway 
Labor Executives Association (1989).

33. D is the correct answer. If any jail time is
to be served, counsel must be provided
to the indigent. Scott v. Illinois (1979).
Thus, A and B are legally incorrect. C
is incorrect because no facts indicated
Kim not to be indigent.

34. C is the correct answer. The jury trial
right attaches only when the sentence
is potentially over 6 months. Blanton v. 
North Las Vegas (1989). Thus, choices
A, B and C are incorrect.

29. B is the correct answer. Although Slo-
bog was lawfully positioned, there was
not probable cause that the brass case
contained cocaine. Thus, the plain view
exception is unavailable. Arizona v. 
Hicks (1987). The evidence was illegal-
ly discovered. A is incorrect because the
mere fact that this was Sarah's "castle"
does not invalidate the search and sei-
zure provided there was a recognized
exception. C is incorrect because there
is no general good faith exception if
there is no warrant obtained prior. D is
incorrect because no facts indicate the
evidence would have inevitably been
discovered.

30. C is the best answer. An invited over-
night guest has standing to object to the
search of his property in the premises.
Minnesota v. Olson (1990). This answer
would have been better had it men-
tioned the illegality of the search, but
it is nevertheless the best of the listed
alternatives. A is incorrect for the same
reason that C is correct. B is incorrect
because there is no general warrantless
good-faith exception. D is incorrect
because there is no LaFave doctrine.

31. C is the best answer. An overnight guest
has standing to object to search of the
premises. Minnesota v. Olson (1990).
Had the answer included that the search
was illegal, it would have been better,
but this is the best alternative offered. A
is incorrect for the same reasons that C
is correct. B and D are incorrect because
there are no such doctrines. 

280 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

35. D is the correct answer. Although coun-
sel need not be given to the indigent if
no jail is imposed, such a conviction can
be used to enhance a later conviction.
Nichols v. U.S. (1994). Since retrial for
the same crime is not at issue, double
jeopardy (choice A) is irrelevant. Since
prosecution and conviction for prosti-
tution has never been considered to be
cruel and unusual punishment, choice
B is obviously incorrect. Choice C is
incorrect for the same reason that choice
D is correct.

A

36. B is the correct answer. As a matter of
law, Conspiracy and its target offense
(on these facts, Robbery) are distinct of-
fenses, under Double Jeopardy analysis.
United States v. Felix (1992). A is ob-
viously incorrect because the multiple
crimes were not prosecuted in separate
jurisdictions. Thus, the separate sov-
ereign limitation on Double Jeopardy
protection is inapplicable. C is incor-
rect because Conspiracy requires proof
of the additional fact that there was an
agreement; and Robbery requires proof
of an additional fact that the crime was
completed (not just agreed to). Thus,
utilizing the traditional Blockburger
analysis, these are separate offenses.
However, there is more to Double
Jeopardy protection than just this test.
Answer D correctly sets out the addi-
tional legal principle regarding Double
Jeopardy protection. A "lesser included
offense" is an offense in which all of the
written elements of one crime appear in
the other. Thus, on these facts, Robbery
is a lesser included offense of Conspir-
acy to commit Robbery. (Conspiracy
is defined here as the meeting of the
minds of two or more people with the
intent to commit Robbery.) D correctly
states this general rule of law, that lesser
included and greater inclusive offenses
are the same offense, in Double Jeop-
ardy analysis. But, the exception to this
rule is regarding Conspiracy — which
is the fact-pattern of this case. D is
therefore incorrect because it ignores
the Felix exception, supra. 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 281

37. C is the correct answer, because only
Choices III and IV are correct. Tennes-
see v. Garner (1985) held that a police
officer can use deadly force on a fleeing
felon only when there is a present public
danger. If deadly force is used when
there is not such a danger, the Fourth
Amendment (as applicable to the states
by the Fourteenth Amendment Due
Process Clause) mandates exclusion
of all evidence discovered (absent an
exception to the Exclusionary Rule).
On the facts given, Wing posed no
public danger. No facts indicated him
to be armed or in any way dangerous
to Officer Breeze or the public. Thus,
there was a clear Fourth Amendment
violation, via this illegal seizure of
the person. Since Wing obviously has
standing (it was his own body which
was seized) and since, on these facts,
no exception to the Exclusionary Rule
(such as inevitable discovery) appears
relevant, all evidence derived from
the illegal seizure must be suppressed.
Choice III is therefore correct because
evidence of the Petty Theft was the
product of the illegal seizure. Choice IV
is correct because evidence of Resist-
ing a Police Officer is also the direct
product of the illegal seizure. Choices I
and II are incorrect for the same reasons
that Choices III and IV are correct.

38. D is the correct answer. The call of the
question queried as to what was the
prosecutor's best argument for allow-
ing in the evidence of Lou's marijuana
possession. Since it was stipulated
that another officer, Smart, was on the
verge of independently discovering the
marijuana, the best argument is "inevi-
table discovery". This exception to the
Exclusionary Rule allows introduction
of illegally seized evidence (here by
Knuckles' coercion), if the prosecution
shows, by a preponderance, that the
evidence would inevitably have been
discovered. Nix v. Whiteside (1984).
Although the facts do not utilize the
precise legal standard above, never-
theless, the stipulation indicates the
likely applicability of this exception.
A is incorrect because the good faith
exception to the Exclusionary Rule
requires there to be a warrant. No facts
indicated there to be a warrant in this
situation. B is incorrect because, in
fact, there was no independent source.
Officer Smart had not yet discovered
the drugs. There was only a hypotheti-
cal independent source. The name for
such is "inevitable discovery." Thus, B
is incorrect for the same reasons that
D is correct. C is obviously incorrect
because the Fourth Amendment and
its jurisprudence is fully applicable to
the states, by way of the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 

282 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

39. C is the correct answer. Although a
search warrant allows the detention of
the lawful possessor of the premises to
be searched, it does not allow the deten-
tion of those merely present at the situs
of the search. Ybarra v. Illinois (1979).
Therefore, the detention of Ebar's two
friends was in violation of the Fourth
Amendment, and evidence discovered
as a result, is to be suppressed. A is
incorrect because the lawful possessor
of premises to be searched can be de-
tained. Such is an inherent power of a
search warrant. Michigan v. Summers 
(1981). B is incorrect because, although
the detention of Ebar's friends was
unlawful, such does not aid Ebar in
any way. "Mere" police illegality, not
directly related to evidence discovered
against the defendant (here Ebar), in no
way mandates suppression of evidence
against the defendant. Fourth Amend-
ment rights are personal. D is incorrect
for the same reasons that C is correct.

40. C is the correct answer because only
choices I and III are correct. Choice I
is obviously correct because the lan-
guage of the Fourth Amendment, itself,
requires probable cause, in order that a
warrant be issued. Choice III is correct
because items observed in "plain view",
while lawfully executing a warrant, can
be seized. This is a traditional exception
to the warrant requirement, and the facts
meet the requirements of this excep-
tion (probable cause and object was
obviously incriminating). See generally
Horton v. California (1990). Choice II
is incorrect because the test for whether
there was probable cause, via a confi-
dential informant's tip, is no longer the
two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli  test, but
is rather, simply, whether the totality of
the circumstances indicate there to be
probable cause of crime, contraband
or evidence of crime. Illinois v. Gates 
(1983).

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 283

A

41. B is the correct answer. Administrative
searches are acceptable even without an
administrative ("area") warrant, when
such are based on a valid public policy,
there is a regulation allowing such and
the area to be searched is considered to
be a "closely regulated" business. The
facts of New York v. Burger (1987)
are directly analogous to the facts of
this case. In Burger, junkyards were
considered closely regulated, there was
a regulation allowing such, the search
was by a police officer and criminal
prosecution resulted. It was held to be
no Fourth Amendment violation. Such
was a valid administrative search. A is
incorrect because no warrant was is-
sued, under the given facts, and such
is a requirement in order to utilize the
good faith exception. Moreover, A is
also incorrect because the good-faith
exception is to the Exclusionary Rule,
it is not an exception to the warrant re-
quirement. C is incorrect for the same
reasons that B is correct. D is incorrect
for two reasons: First, no facts indicate
Lemon to have acted in bad faith. Sec-
ondly, the bad faith of the involved offi-
cer is not relevant to the acceptability of
an administrative search. The elements
required of a proper administrative
search were set out above... and do not
include good faith.

42. C is the correct answer. Although it was
stipulated in the facts that there was a
Miranda violation, the U.S. Supreme
Court has indicated that most trial
errors, provided that the prosecution
proves them to be harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt, will not require the
setting aside of the finding of guilt.
Chapman v. California (1967). A is
incorrect because it misreads the facts
an error was stipulated. Choices B and
D are incorrect because they use the
wrong evidentiary standard.

43. D is the correct answer because choices
A, B and C are all incorrect. If an
arrestee merely invokes his right to
silence, after being given the Miranda
warnings, then he can be reinterrogated.
[There is the contrary answer, when the
attorney right is invoked. Edwards v. 
Arizona  (1981)] Michigan v. Mosley
(1975). Answer A is obviously incorrect
because, although the U.S. Supreme
Court may appear to limit the protec-
tions in the Bill of Rights, particularly
in drug cases, this is certainly not the
stated law. B is incorrect for the same
reason that D is correct. C is incorrect
for two reasons: First, there is no law
indicating factually voluntary admis-
sions to be per se involuntary; secondly,
a suspect not being told of the crimes for
which he is being interrogated, is of no
legal significance. Colorado v. Spring
(1987). 

284 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

44. A is the correct answer. Only when a
suspect has been formally charged with
a crime (not just arrested), does the
Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel at-
tach. If such attaches, an attorney must
be present during the post-charging, live
identification procedure. If the attorney
has not been invited, the out-of-court
identification will be suppressed.
United States v. Wade (1967). Since
there was no formal charging here, the
identification is likely admissible. B is
incorrect, for the same reasons that A is
correct. Choices C and D are incorrect
because only extraordinarily unfair or
"suggestive" visual identification pro-
cedures violate Due Process. Although
a one-on-one identification (known as
a "showup") is somewhat suggestive,
it is the extraordinarily rare case where
such is deemed to be a constitutional
violation. On the facts of this case, the
proximity of the identification with the
alleged crime, and the sureness of the
alleged victim, undoubtedly indicate the
identification to be admissible. Neil v. 
Biggers (1972).

A

45. C is the correct answer. Once an in-
dividual is formally charged, here by
a grand jury, he possesses the Sixth
Amendment Right to Counsel. Not
only must he be so informed (Patterson
v. Illinois (1988)), but if he invokes
such, the police can neither directly
nor indirectly (via use of an infor-
mant) interrogate him on the charged
crime. Massiah v. United States (1964).
However, unlike the Fifth Amend-
ment Miranda protection, the Sixth
Amendment protection extends only to
interrogation regarding the indicted/ar-
raigned crime. It is "offense-specific".
McNeil v. Wisconsin (1991). Choice
C incorporates the above principles,
i.e., only the information, regarding
the unindicted crimes, is admissible.
A and B are partially incorrect in that
the information garnered regarding the
unindicted offenses is admissible. Hoffa
v. United States (1966). D is incorrect
for the same reasons that C is correct.

46. C is the correct answer. The Sixth
Amendment Right to Counsel attaches
to indigents only when actual jail time
is imposed, or if the prosecution is for
a felony. Gideon v. Wainwright (1963).
Thus, if, as here, no jail is imposed,
there has been no constitutional viola-
tion. A is incorrect in that it confuses
the Jury Trial right, with the Counsel
right [which does attach when the jail
potential is over 6 months]. B is an
incorrect statement of law. Nichols v. 
U.S. (1994). D is incorrect for the same
reason that C is correct.  

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 285

48. B is the correct answer. With few excep-
tions, the Sixth Amendment Confronta-
tion Clause, as applied to the states by
the Fourteenth Amendment Due Pro-
cess Clause, mandates that defendants
be allowed to confront (cross-examine)
adverse witnesses. Pointer v. Texas
(1965). Had Joyce not taken the stand,
on her own volition, the answer would
have been different. A defendant waives
her Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment
Self-Incrimination protection by vol-
untarily taking the stand at the trial.
She cannot take the stand, testify on her
own behalf and then refuse to answer
questions on cross-examination which
are reasonably related, as here, to her
testimony on direct. Brown v. United
States (1958). For these reasons and
case-holding, choice A is incorrect. C is
incorrect for similar reasons. Although
two constitutional rights do conflict here
(Confrontation and Self-Incrimination),
the Supreme Court has struck a reason-
able balance, via the above rulings. D
is incorrect for the same reasons that B
is correct. 

47. D is the correct answer. Pate v. Robin-
son (1966) indicated that trial judges,
on their own motion, must insure that
unless the defendant is mentally com-
petent, he cannot be criminally tried.
On the facts given, such an inquiry is
clearly warranted. Delusions indicate a
substantial possibility of incompetence,
i.e., the inability to aid in the defense,
and disorientation as to the facts of the
crime and reality (see Dusky v. United
States (1960)).

On the facts given, it was an unconsti-
tutional violation of Fourteenth Amend-
ment Due Process to not require psychi-
atric evaluation regarding competency
prior to the trial. A is incorrect for the
identical reasons that D is correct. B
is incorrect because the issue at hand
is not whether the defendant is Insane
[because of mental disease he did not
know the wrongfulness of his actions].
Insanity is an affirmative defense. It
has a different test than competency.
That is, a defendant may be sufficiently
oriented and possess sufficient ability
to aid in his own defense and still not
know what he was doing was wrong.
Furthermore, Insanity queries: what
was the defendant's state of mind at the
time of the crime, itself. Competency
queries: what was the defendant's state
of mind at the time of trial. C is factually
incorrect because there are sufficient
facts indicating extreme mental disor-
der, and, thus, a real possibility of in-
competence. The inquiry must be made,
via pre-trial psychiatric examination.

286 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

49. C is the correct answer because both
choices I and II are relevant inquiries.
The Eighth Amendment Cruel and
Unusual Punishment Clause, as applied
to the states by the Fourteenth Amend-
ment Due Process Clause, mandates
that methods of execution not be both
"cruel" and "unusual". See Robinson
v. California (1962) (which indicated
this aspect of the Eighth Amendment
to be state-applicable); and Weems v. 
United States (1910) (which indicated
that a violation of the Clause requires
that the punishment be both "cruel"
and "unusual"). Choice I is therefore
correct because it addresses the issue
of whether death by dismemberment is
an "unusual" practice. Choice  II is cor-
rect because it addresses the question
whether death by dismemberment is
unduly "cruel". A is not the best answer
because it only includes Choice  I. B is
not the best answer because it only in-
cludes Choice II. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that C is correct.

A

50. D is the correct answer. When a Habeas
Corpus petitioner does not object to the
admissibility of certain evidence at the
appropriate time (usually this is pre-tri-
al, but it could be at trial depending on
the state's rules), then she is deemed
to have "procedurally defaulted" (by
failing to contemporaneously object). In
such instance, in order for this defaulted
claim to be heard on Habeas (collateral
appeal), she must show good cause
why such was not brought up at the
appropriate time, and also must show
prejudice to her case. Wainwright v. 
Sykes (1977). Since Miranda is and has
been settled law, Karen will be unable
to show "cause" why she did not bring
up this claim at the appropriate time. A
is incorrect because, in not granting the
petition, the court is correctly following
the above law. Such is not error at all. B
is incorrect because, even though there
was a Miranda violation, such must be
claimed at the appropriate time or is
generally forfeited. C is a correct state-
ment of fact. Karen's counsel was likely
ineffective. However, ineffectiveness of
counsel is its own Habeas claim. In fact,
it is the better claim here. Nevertheless,
the facts stipulated that such was not
the argument of her Habeas petition.
Therefore, choice C is irrelevant to the
actual claim which Karen made. 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 287

53. C is the correct answer. Under the cir-
cumstances, the U.S. Marshal should
have secured a search warrant upon
sworn information, describing with
reasonable particularity the thing for
which the search was to be made. By
not doing so, the Marshal acted "with-
out sanction of law" in direct violation
of the constitutional prohibition action
of action. (See Weeks v. United States,
232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341 (1914)). As
such, B is clearly wrong. A is wrong
because law enforcement officials can-
not further the government's case in
direct violation of the constitution. D
is incorrect because a defendant is not
necessarily entitled to the return of his
property merely because his application
for its return was seasonal.

54. D is the best answer. A and B are wrong
for the reasons set forth in 53 above.
Though C could be correct, D is more
specific as to the reason why the gov-
ernment should not be permitted to use
Mac's property at trial.

55. D is the best answer. In Mapp v. Ohio,
367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684 (1961),
it was held that "the right to privacy
embodied in the Fourth Amendment
is enforceable against the States, and
that the right to be secure against rule
invasions of privacy by state officers
is, therefore, constitutional in origin."
A, B and C are wrong because they are
incorrect statements of law. 

51. D is the best answer. A is incorrect
because Aire Head, a student, has no
reasonable expectation of privacy, since
Mr. Locke, a school official, is merely
investigating whether a violation of a
school infraction has occurred. D is
correct because it is a better answer
than B and C, since it specifically deals
with the concept of "reasonableness."
In New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325,
105 S.Ct. 733 (1985), it was held that
a school official's intrusion into the
privacy of a student was "reasonable"
since it was necessary to achieve the
legitimate end of preserving order in
the schools. Here, since Mr. Locke was
merely investigating whether a school
rule had been violated, his searching
of the purse for cigarettes would be
deemed "reasonable."

52. D is correct because A, B and C are
irrelevant. In Hudson v. Palmer, 468
U.S. 517 (1984), the Supreme Court
concluded that the requirements of
prison security make it unreasonable
for prisoners to expect protection for
their privacy.

288 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

56. D is the correct answer. Absent other
facts, the mere smell of breath mints
does not mean the driver is intoxicated.
For that reason, A is incorrect. B is
incorrect because it is irrelevant what
was found in the face of an unlawful
search. C is incorrect because there are
no facts which give rise to this excep-
tion. Moreover, the inventory exception
requires lawful police possession of the
property.

57. A is the correct answer. Crumpky had
no probable cause to search Gloss' car.
The rear of the car could have been low
because she was transporting bags of
fertilizer home to do gardening work.
A low rear-end does not necessarily
speak of illegal activity. B is wrong for
the same reasons C in question 56 is
wrong. C is an incorrect statement of
law. (See One 1958 Plymouth Sedan
v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct 1246 (1965)).
D is irrelevant because the car is not
contraband.

58. D is the correct answer. Viewing a
greenhouse is likely not a search as con-
templated by the Fourth Amendment.
No privacy expectation was invaded.
(See United States v. Dunn (1987)). A is
incorrect; off-duty police officers may
engage in law enforcement activity if
the situation so warrants. B and C are
nonsense.

A

59. D is the best answer. A is incorrect
because the trash cans were not on the
curb, but on Middo's home property,
therefore he does have a privacy ex-
pectation. Cf. California v. Greenwood
(1988). B is wrong because the facts do
not indicate an emergency. C is wrong
because the good faith exception does
not apply to warrantless seearches (and
is also wrong because relying on a
clearly defective warrant is not reason-
able good faith). D is therefore the best
choice.

60. D is the correct answer because all
warrants require judicial/magistrate ap-
proval indicated by either signature or
seal. As such, A, B and C are wrong.

61. A is the best answer because a warrant
secured in bad faith which is subse-
quently deemed invalid will keep the
evidence found pursuant to the warrant
from coming in. (See Massachusetts v. 
Sheppard (1984)). B is also correct but
is not as fact specific as A. C and D are
wrong because A is correct.

62. D is the correct answer because A, B
and C are wrong. A is wrong because
the facts indicate that Palmer was act-
ing in bad faith. B is wrong because
there are no facts to indicate that other
evidence would have been discovered.
C is wrong because a warrant, under the
circumstances articulated in the answer,
is required despite the incriminating
nature of the evidence already discov-
ered. 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 289

63. C is the correct answer because "it [is]
incumbent on the suspect to preserve
his privacy from visual observation."
(See Commonwealth v. Hernley, 216
Pa.Superior Ct. 177, 263 A.2d 904
(1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 914
(1971)). As such, A, B and D are incor-
rect.

64. D is the correct answer because there
"can be no expectation of privacy when
one leaves his windows open or uncov-
ered so that any passerby might peer
into one's dwelling with impunity, and
the same result should apply regard-
less of where the window or opening
is placed in the dwelling." (See Com-
monwealth v. Pennsylvania, 525 Pa.
250, 579 A.2d 1288 (1990), where the
expectation of privacy did not attach
to a translucent rooftop). As such, A, B
and C are wrong.

65. C is the correct answer because failure
of a defendant, or those with him, or
those employed by him, to close his
premises to the world negates defen-
dant's argument that he was deprived
of his privacy. (See Commonwealth v. 
Johnson, 247 Pa.Superior Ct. 208, 372
A.2d 11 (1977)). As such, A, B and D
are wrong.

66. B is the correct answer and is a better
answer than A because it is more fact
specific than A. C is wrong because
helicopters are permitted to fly at any al-
titude only if the operation is conducted
without hazard to persons or property
on the surface. (See Commonwealth v. 
Johnson, supra). D is wrong because it
is irrelevant that the marijuana was clear
and visible when the search was unrea-
sonable and violative of constitutional
requirements prohibiting unreasonable
searches and seizures, since hazard to
persons or property on the surface oc-
curred.

67. C is the correct answer because Bob
exposed his garbage to the public suf-
ficiently to defeat his claim to Fourth
Amendment protection. (See California
v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35, 108 S.Ct.
1625 (1988)). A is wrong because the
Fourth Amendment does not prohibit
the warrantless search and seizure of
garbage left for collection outside the
curtilage of a home. B is wrong for the
same reason as A, even though Bob's
trash bags were opaque and securely
tied. D is wrong because A and B are
wrong.

290 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

68. D is the correct answer. As articulated
in California v. Greenwood, supra, the
(black) plastic bags involved here are
protected from warrantless searches
when used to store or transport personal
possessions. Since there are no facts
indicating that the officer had reason to
believe that the specific bags on Bob's
porch contained anything illegal inside
them, the officer, thus, had no right
to search through them. As such, this
warrantless search and seizure would
be prohibited by the Fourth Amend-
ment. For the foregoing reasons, C is
wrong.

69. C is the correct answer. Frodd "is in
no better position than the citizen who
merely tears up a document by hand and
discards the pieces on the sidewalk."
(See United States v. Scott, 975 F.2d
927 (1st Cir.1992)). Thus, A, B and D
are wrong because the Fourth Amend-
ment does not prohibit the warrantless
search and seizure of garbage left for
collection outside one's home.

A

70. A is the correct answer. "A chemical
test that merely discloses whether or
not a particular substance is cocaine
does not compromise any legitimate
interest in privacy." (See United States 
v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 104 S.Ct.
1652 (1984)). B is wrong because the
federal agent did not infringe any con-
stitutionally protected privacy interest
that had not already been frustrated as
the result of private conduct (Federal
Excess employees). C is wrong because
a field test can destroy some of the
evidence, not all of it, and still render
the search and seizure valid. The facts
do not indicate all of the evidence was
destroyed. As such, the seizure was not
unreasonable. D is wrong because both
B and C are wrong.

71. D is the best answer and is better than
C because it characterizes the actions of
the agents as having gone beyond the
scope of the private search, e.g., Ms.
Prude's mere opening of the package
versus the viewing of the videos inside
the package. (See Walter v. United
States, 447 U.S. 649 (1980)). As such,
A and B are wrong.

72. A is the correct answer. By procuring
the hash for his personal use, John was
not furthering a governmental objective
and, thus, his actions were not governed
by the Fourth Amendment. (See United
States v. Smith, 810 F.2d 996 (10th Cir.
1987)). As such, D is wrong and B and
C are irrelevant. 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 291

75. D is the correct answer. Mary only
gave consent to the officers because
she believed they had the authority
to enter her home. Moreover, even if
she hadn't given consent, she most
likely believed the officers would have
entered her home anyway under the
power of the warrant. (See Bumper v. 
North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543 (1968)).
As such, A, B and C are wrong. While
it might appear C could be correct under
the good- faith exception, that excep-
tion only applies when an officer(s) has
physical possession of a warrant later
deemed defective. There are no facts
here to indicate, either in the fact pat-
tern or answer choice C, that an actual
warrant existed.

76. D is the best answer as such probation
conditions are held to be valid in some
jurisdictions. (See State v. Gawron, 736
P.2d 1295 (Idaho 1987). C is a poten-
tially true statement; however, there
is no case law taking this view. A and
B are wrong because the fact pattern
involves a probationer.

77. C is the correct answer. Without invok-
ing any concept of consent, the search
of a probationer by an officer can be
upheld as a "regulatory search" justi-
fied by the special needs of effective
probation supervision. (See Griffin v. 
Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 107 S.Ct.
3164 (1987)). A and B are wrong be-
cause Malcolm is a probationer. D is
wrong because A and B are wrong.

73. Though inexplicit, C is the best answer.
The central queries with the Fourth
Amendment ... and its consent excep-
tion to the warrant requirement, is who
has standing to consent and whether
the police acted in an objectively rea-
sonable manner. Certainly a butler has
apparent authority to consent. Illiinois 
v. Rodriguez (1990). Thus choice B
is incorrect—the butler has apparent
authority to allow entry. Additionally,
the focus is on whether the police over-
reached, i.e., used intimidation. See
Florida v. Bostick (1991). Since the
facts indicate they did not, the consent
is voluntary and valid. Thus, although
arguable, choice A, which emphasizes
the subjective mental state of the butler,
is not supported by case law. D is incor-
rect for the same reasons that A and B
are incorrect.

74. A is the best answer. Hotel management
or staff is entitled to retake possession
of a room after check out time because,
at this time, the hotel guest no longer
has standing. (See Stoner v. California,
376 U.S. 483 (1964)). While B is a true
statement of law, A is the better answer
for the reasons discussed above. C is
not necessarily true because there are
times when a third party can give con-
sent. D is wrong because A is the better
answer.

292 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

A

730
OE

cy

mr— 

78. C is the correct answer. Many cases
have held that there is no illegal entry
when a police officer poses as a drug
purchaser to gain consensual entry to
the premises of a drug dealer. (See
Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206
(1966)). As such, answers A and B are
wrong. D is wrong because C is more
fact specific as to why Tommy allowed
Bust to enter his home.

79. B is the correct answer. Officer Bust's
additional intrusions into the drawers
and envelopes while Tommy was in
the bathroom could not be justified on
the basis of consent, since Tommy only
consented to let Officer Bust inside his
home, not his drawers and envelopes.
A is wrong because of the additional
intrusions made by Officer Bust. C is
wrong for the reasons articulated in
answer 78. D is nonsense.

80. A is the correct answer. Under Lewis
v. United States, supra, concealment
of one's status as a law enforcement
officer does not invalidate the consent,
at least in the case of a transaction oc-
curring between the "officer" and the
defendant that is understood by both
parties to be illegal. The result would
likely be different if, as here, the police
officer gained entry by pretending to
be a telephone technician or gas-meter
reader. In such a scenario, there is no
understanding that an illegal transac-
tion is about to take place since the
defendant believes the officer to be a
telephone technician and not a person
there to buy drugs. As such, B, C and
D are wrong.

81. C is the correct answer. The court in
Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S.
543 (1968), "upheld the voluntariness
of consent despite the deceptive prac-
tices by government agents." In short,
officers can disclose their identity but
misrepresent their purpose. (See also
State v. Johnson, 253 Kan. 356, 856
P.2d 134 (1993)). Here, because Bust's
behavior was not threatening or coer-
cive, and Tommy was willing to let Bust
enter, and Bust did not exceed the scope
of the consent, the evidence would be
admissible. As such, A and B are wrong.
D is a correct answer, but C is better
because it sets forth the reasons why
the motion will fail.

82. D is the correct answer. The warrant will
be found valid because it was based on
the reasonable belief that there was only
one apartment on the fifth floor, and
the search pursuant to that warrant was
lawful because the officers reasonably
believed they were searching Dump's
apartment when they discovered the
two kilos of hash and the drug scale.
(See Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S.
79 (1987)). As such, A, B and C are
wrong.

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 293

85. D is the correct answer. If an officer
knows that a suspect(s) is armed and
dangerous, the officer may enter with-
out giving advance notice of her author-
ity and purpose. Since Stonelli was a
known Mafia hitman listed as "armed
and dangerous," the actions of Kent,
Camel and Kool were proper. As such,
A, B and C are wrong.

86. D is the correct answer. Officers are
allowed to "look in closets and other
spaces immediately adjoining the place
of arrest from which an attack could im-
mediately be launched." (See Maryland
v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325 (1990)). Since
Stonelli was known to the officers
to be "armed and dangerous," it was
reasonable for the officers to believe
that one of Stonelli's associates could
indeed be armed and dangerous. As
such, the officer's search, limited to the
living room and an adjoining hallway,
was valid. A and B are wrong because,
under such circumstances, the arresting
officers need neither probable cause nor
reasonable suspicion. (See  Maryland v. 
Buie, supra). Thus, C is wrong. 

83. A is the correct answer. Hill v. Califor-
nia, 401 U.S. 797 (1971), upheld the
lawfulness of an arrest that turned out
to be a case of mistaken identity. Since
Officer Jones' had a reasonable belief
that Howard Limbo was the suspect
at the time the search was made,  his
actions will be deemed lawful, even
though his reasonable belief turned out
to be mistaken. As such, B is wrong.
C is wrong because Officer Jones had
sufficient reason to search the pockets
of Howard Limbo, since Limbo was
wearing almost exactly what the suspect
was wearing. D is wrong because it is
irrelevant.

84. D is the best answer. In some jurisdic-
tions, unreasonable delay in acting
upon a warrant may make the arrest
unlawful. Since approximately 5 weeks
had passed before Thomas and Hill ex-
ecuted the warrant, it could be possible
that the information the warrant was
based on had become stale. Typically,
warrants have to be acted upon within
10 days, thus A is incorrect. B is incor-
rect because we are not told if the facts
are taking place in a state that requires
that a search warrant be executed in
daytime hours. C is wrong because un-
der the explanation for answer choice
A, a warrant can still be deemed invalid,
even if technically sound.

294 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

87. C is the correct answer. A search
could occur if "a reasonably prudent
officer believe[d] that the area to be
swept harbors an individual posing a
danger to those on the arrest scene."
(See Maryland v. Buie, supra). Such a
search would be supported and found
reasonable because Stonelli is deemed
by police files to be "armed and danger-
ous." As such, A and B are wrong. D
is wrong because such a search, under
the circumstances, would be deemed
lawful.

88. D is the correct answer. The motion will
fail because the search would not be
invalidated merely because the officers
knew about the weapons and hoped to
find them during the search. (See Hor-
ton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990)).
As such, A and B are wrong. C is wrong
because evidence does not need to be
discovered "inadvertently" for the plain
view doctrine to apply. (See  Horton v. 
California, supra).

89. C is the correct answer. The facts do
not indicate the officers had probable
cause to arrest any of the customers.
(See Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85
(1979)). As such, A and B are wrong.
D is nonsense.

90. A is the correct answer. Such an action
would likely be deemed unreasonable
to protect the safety of the officers. (See
Ybarra v. Illinois, supra). The mere pro-
pinquity to crime does not allow search
of all of those near. As such, B, C and
D are wrong.

A

91. D is the correct answer. Such a deten-
tion would likely prevent flight in case
grounds for arrest are found in the
search, minimize the risk of harm to
the officers, and facilitate the orderly
completion of the search. (See Michi-
gan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692 (1981)).
A is wrong because there are no facts
indicating coercive behavior by the of-
ficers, especially since the detainment
was temporary. B and C are wrong
because D is correct.

92. D is the best answer. The officer likely
had a basis for reasonable suspicion
but not probable cause. In the absence
of probable cause, the officer was not
entitled to inspect the CD player. Rea-
sonable suspicion is not enough. (See
Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987)).
A is wrong because, even though the
officers lawfully entered the apartment,
they were not entitled to inspect the CD
player. B, though a true statement, is
not as good an answer as D because the
issue is whether an unlawful search of
the CD player occurred. C is wrong as
discussed in the explanation of answer
D.

93. C is the correct answer, under  United
States v. Beal, 810 F.2d 574 (6th Cir.
1987), which held that the seizure of
pen guns in plain view was unlawful be-
cause it was not immediately apparent
that these items were contraband. A is
wrong because it contradicts the correct
answer. B is wrong because answer B
is part of answer A. D is wrong because
C is correct. 

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 295

A

94. A is the correct answer. "The fact that
[the officers] took the opportunity pro-
vided by [Johnny Boy] to obtain an oral
confession is quite consistent with the
Fifth Amendment." See Connecticut v. 
Barrett, 479 U.S. 523 (1987)). As such,
B, C and D are wrong and only serve as
distracters.

95. C is the correct answer. Nine officers
in a suspect's bedroom would likely be
found to create a potential for compul-
sion equivalent to interrogation at the
police station. (See Orozco v. Texas,
394 U.S. 324 (1969)). A is wrong be-
cause individuals can be in custody
outside the police station. B is wrong
because a suspect can be in custody in
his own home. D is wrong because C
is more fact specific in that it explains
why a reasonable person would believe
this was an interrogation.

96. C is the correct answer. If the invitation
was the kind that could not be refused,
coercion would likely be found present.
If so, then a finding of custody is likely.
A is wrong because an individual isn't
necessarily in custody just because they
are at the police station. B is wrong
because it would depend on what kind
of invitation was extended to Johnny
Boy. D is wrong because an individual
doesn't have to be under arrest to be in
custody.

97. C is the correct answer. An officer can
investigate suspicious circumstances
without triggering the need to give
Miranda warnings. Such roadside ques-
tioning would likely be deemed a Terry
stop. (See Berkemer v. Mc Carty, 468
U.S. 420 (1984)). A is wrong because
questioning by a police officer is not
always custodial interrogation. B is
wrong because, as discussed in the ex-
planation for answer C, Johnny can be
detained for suspicion of drunk driving.
D is wrong because O'Hair only needs
a good-faith belief Johnny was drunk.

98. A is the correct answer. The record
indicates that Youbanks was not asked
any questions by the judge concerning
his guilty plea, nor did Youbanks ad-
dress the court. As such, "the record
does not disclose that the defendant
voluntarily and understandingly entered
his pleas of guilty." In other words, the
record indicates that the judge accepted
Youbanks' guilty plea without any af-
firmative showing that it was intelligent
and voluntary, since the judge did not
question Youbanks in regard to his plea.
Thus, his conviction can be reversed.
(See Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S.
238, 89 S.Ct. 1709 (1969)). B is wrong
because reversible error can occur even
if a defendant's conviction is based on
credible eye-witness testimony. C and
D are wrong for the reasons discussed
in the explanation of answer A. 

296 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

100. A is the correct answer because "when
a plea rests in any significant degree on
a promise or agreement of the prosecu-
tor, so that it can be said to be part of
the inducement or consideration, such
promise must be fulfilled." Thus, even
though a new and different prosecutor
broke the government's promise, the
prosecutor's office has the burden of
"letting the left hand know what the
right hand is doing." (See Santobello
v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct.
495 (1971)). As such, B, C and D are
wrong.
A

99. A is the correct answer. Astro, the
defendant, must demonstrate in his
habeas petition that there was a rea-
sonable probability that, but for the
court-appointed attorney's errors, he
would not have pleaded guilty and
would have insisted on going to trial.
Thus, if this was not alleged, no relief
will be granted. (See Hill v. Lockhart,
474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366 (1985)). B
is wrong for the reasons articulated in
the explanation of answer choice A.
C is wrong because the United States
Supreme Court has never held that the
United States Constitution requires the
State to furnish a defendant with infor-
mation about parole eligibility in order
for the defendant's plea of guilty to be
voluntary. (See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
11(c); Advisory Committee's Notes on
1974 Amendment to Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 11, 18 U.S.C.App., p. 22). D is
wrong because Astro's mistaken belief
will have no bearing on whether he is
granted relief absent a showing that he
would have acted otherwise had he had
the correct information at his disposal.
(See explanation to answer A).

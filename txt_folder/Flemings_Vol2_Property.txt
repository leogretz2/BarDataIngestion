PROPERTY QUESTIONS

1. Juan Antonio conveyed his house and
land to Carlos by a validly executed and
delivered warranty deed which stated:

"To have and to hold the above-

described tract of land in fee

simple absolute, subject to the

understanding that said grantee

shall construct and maintain a fa-

cility for the preservation of wild

horses on said property."

Carlos did, in fact, construct and main-
tain a facility for the preservation of
wild horses on the property which he
operated for ten years after the grant
from Juan Antonio. However, at the
end of ten years, Carlos converted the
property to a dude ranch. All parties
agree that a dude ranch is not a facility
for the preservation of wild horses.

Juan Antonio seeks a court declara-
tion that the change in the property's
use means that the land and house has
reverted to him. In this lawsuit, Juan
Antonio will:

A. Lose, because an equitable
charge is enforceable only in
equity.

B. Win, because the language of the
deed created a fee simple deter-
minable, which leaves a possibil-
ity of reverter in the grantor.     

C. Lose, because the language of the
deed created only a contractual
obligation and did not create
a reversionary interest in Juan
Antonio.

D. Win, because the language of the
deed created a fee simple subject
to condition subsequent, which
leaves a power of termination,
or right of entry, in the grantor.

2. Terry and Harry leased a house from
Larry, the landlord. The lease was in
proper form and contained the follow-
ing language:

"Any assignment, subletting or

transfer of any rights under this

lease without the express written

consent of Larry, the landlord,

shall be null and void and is pro-

hibited."

Despite this clause, after Terry and Har-
ry moved into the house, Harry verbally
invited Gary to share the house with
Terry and himself. Gary agreed to pay
his portion of the rent to Larry who did
not object to this arrangement. Terry,
however, objected to Gary's sharing
the dwelling, even if Gary paid a fair
share of the rent.

As soon as Gary moved into the house,
Terry sued Harry, Gary and Larry for a
declaratory judgment, that Harry was
without rights to assign to Gary. Harry
answered that he and Terry were tenants
in common for the estate of a term of
years, and that he, Harry, had the right
to assign a part interest in his undivided
one-half interest in the leasehold. The
court should award judgment in favor
of:

A. Terry, because a co-tenant has no
right to assign any part or all of
a leasehold without the consent
of all relevant parties.

B. Terry, because the lease contained
a "no assignment" clause.

C. Harry, because Terry is not the
beneficiary of the "no assign-
ment" clause in the lease.

D. Harry, because Terry's claim is
essentially a restraint on alien-
ation and is disfavored.

3. In 1970, Oscar executed his will in

which he left Ochreacre:

384 PROPERTY

"To my surviving widow for life,
and then to such of my children
who shall reach 30 years of age;
however, if any such child should
die under the age of 30 and such
child shall be survived by a child
or children, that child or children
shall step up and take his or her
parents' share being that share
which would have gone to that
parent had he or she attained the
age of 30 years."

In 1970, at the time of the will, Oscar
was married to Wendy and he and
Wendy had two children, Arnold and
Beulah. Beulah had one child, Carlotta.
In 1980, Wendy died and Oscar remar-
ried a woman named, Winfred. In 1981,
Winfred and Oscar had a son named,
Delbert. In 1985, Oscar died survived
by Winfred, Arnold, Beulah, Carlotta
and Delbert.

In a state which applies the common
law Rule Against Perpetuities unmodi-
fied by statute, the result of applying
the Rule to the interests under the will
is that:

A. The remainder to Oscar's chil-
dren and grandchildren is void
because Oscar could have mar-
ried a person not yet in being
at the time Oscar's will was
executed.

B. The remainder to the children is
valid and the substitute gift to the
grandchildren is also valid. 

C. The remainder to Arnold and
Beulah is valid, but the remain-
der to Carlotta is void as is any
gift to Carlotta's children.

D. The remainder to the children is
valid, but the substitute gift to
the grandchildren is void because
Oscar could have married a per-
son not yet in being at the time
Oscar's will was executed.

4. In 1990, Andrea was the owner of
Pinkacre. However, in 1990, Mary gave
a warranty deed to Pinkacre to Nancy.
Nancy promptly recorded that deed. In
1991, Andrea conveyed Pinkacre by
warranty deed to Mary who promptly
recorded her deed. In 1992, Mary gave
a warranty deed to Pinkacre to Orene
who promptly recorded her deed. Orene
paid fair market value for Pinkacre and
was unaware of any prior conveyances
of Pinkacre. Both Orene and Nancy
claim title to Pinkacre. The court should
award judgment to:

A. Nancy, because her deed is prior

in time to Orene's.

B. Orene, because she was a pur-
chaser for value without notice
of Nancy's claim.

C. Either Orene or Nancy, depend-
ing on whether Pinkacre is lo-
cated in a state which applies
estoppel by deed.

Q

D. Either Orene or Nancy, depend-
ing on whether Nancy's deed is
deemed to be recorded within
Orene's chain of title.

C. Xavier as first taker of the fod-

der.

D. The person who then held title
to Purpleacre in fee simple ab-
solute.

6. After Orville's 1993 conveyance to
Norris, title to Purpleacre was in:

A. Xavier.

B. Orville.

C. Yves.

D. Norris.

7. While her daughter, Darla, was away at
school, Marie executed and promptly
recorded a deed in the proper form to
Marie's property, Yellowacre, to Darla.
When Marie told Dada what she (Ma-
rie) had done, Darla said, "Mother, I
don't want Yellowacre. You take that
deed right back. It's yours." Before
any other relevant events, Darla died
leaving her entire estate to Butch.
Marie then sued Butch to quiet title in
Yellowacre. If Marie wins, it will be
because:

A. The presumption of delivery
arising from recordation is in-
valid unless the grantee has
knowledge of the deed at the
time of recording.

Questions 5 — 6 are based on the
following facts:

In 1970, Orville owned Purpleacre in fee
simple absolute. Unbeknownst to Orville, in
1971, Xavier entered Purpleacre under color
of title and began to use a square of land on
the eastern side of Purpleacre to cut fodder
for food for Xavier's sheep. After 14 years
of possession of Purpleacre, Xavier gave
possession of Purpleacre to Yves. Xavier
also sold Yves all his sheep and purported
to transfer to Yves, Xavier's interests in
the fodder and fodder area by means of a
document which was adequate to transfer
personal property (the sheep), but inadequate
to transfer real property.

In 1986, Xavier leased Purpleacre from
Orville for a term of five years. At the end
of the five year term, Xavier remained on
Purpleacre for two more years before he
quit Purpleacre. In 1993, Orville conveyed
Purpleacre by quitclaim deed to Norris.
Purpleacre is located in a state where the
statute of limitations for adverse possession
is ten years.

5. After Orville's 1993 conveyance to
Norris, title to the fodder area was in:

A. Yves, as the purchaser of the
fodder area under the 1985 docu-
ment selling Xavier's sheep to
Yves.

B. The person who owned fodder
rights as a necessary incident to
the fodder.

386 PROPERTY

	
	
Q

B. There was no effective ac-
ceptance of the delivery of the
deed.

C. Darla's renunciation of Yellow-
acre was a constructive convey-
ance to Marie.

D. The court will impose a construc-
tive trust to carry out Darla's
intent.

8. Abe conveyed Silveracres to "Ben and
his heirs, but if Ben dies survived by
children who attain the age of 30, then
to Carl and his heirs." Once Ben began
possessing Silveracres, he began to
cut the valuable timber on Silveracres
without giving Carl any notice of his
actions. Ben is married to Darlene but
has no children. If Carl sues for an ac-
counting for the value of the cut timber
and for an injunction to prevent future
logging, and the court gives judgment
against Carl and in favor of Ben, it will
be because:

A. Carl has no interest in Silver-

acres.

B. The right to log and remove tim-
ber is an incident to possession.

C. The right to log and remove tim-
ber is an incident to a fee.

D. There is no showing Ben acted

in bad faith.

9. John and Joan, an unmarried couple,
owned Goldacre as tenants in common.
After five years, they orally agreed that
there was no need for them to make
wills since the survivor of either of
them would own Goldacre solely and
outright per this agreement. Three years
later, John died intestate. One day later,
Joan died, also intestate. John's sole heir
is his father, Dave; Joan's sole heir is
her aunt, Sophie. Dave claims an inter-
est in Goldacre; Sophie claims all of
Goldacre. Goldacre is located in a state
with the Statute of Frauds, but no other
applicable statute. That state does not
recognize common law marriages.

In the Dave v. Sophie  litigation regard-
ing the ownership of Goldacre, the court
should find that:

A. Dave and Sophie each own an
undivided interest in Goldacre
because the deaths of John and
Joan were essentially simultane-
ous.

B. Dave and Sophie each own an
undivided interest in Goldacre
because the Statute of Frauds
applies.

C. Sophie owns Goldacres solely
because John and Joan did not
make wills in detrimental reli-
ance on the oral agreement. 

PROPERTY 387

D. Sophie owns Goldacre solely be-
cause she is entitled to equitable
reformation of the title to reflect
the oral agreement.

Questions 10 —11 are based on the
following facts:  

Orson is the owner of a 1,000 acre tract of
land called Greyacres. Orson wishes to de-
velop Greyacres into a planned residential
community surrounding a man-made lake
and marina. He needs to ensure that pro-
spective purchasers of lots in Greyacres are
guaranteed the following 3 things:

1) Apart from the lake and marina,
no non-residential use will be
made of Greyacres.

2) Residents of lots in Greyacres
will have clear access to and use
of the marina and lake which ac-
cess and use will be capable of
being transferred to subsequent
purchasers of those lots.

3) Residents of lots in Greyacres
must be obligated to pay a pro-
rated share for the maintenance
of the lake and marina regardless
of their actual use of the facili-
ties.

10. In the context of the entire scheme of de-
velopment, which of the following will
offer the best method of implementing
Orson's requirement that residents of
Greyacres pay money to maintain the
lake and marina?

A. An easement.

B. A covenant.

C. A mortgage. 

388 PROPERTY

    
D. A personal contractual obligation

by each purchaser.

11. Which of the following is the greatest
difficulty that Orson will face in estab-
lishing his scheme on Greyacres?

A. The scheme, if effective, renders

title unmarketable.

B. One or more of the essential re-
quirements for development of
Greyacres constitute a restraint
on alienation.

C. There is a judicial reluctance to
recognize an affirmative burden
to pay money over an indefinite
period as an obligation which
attaches to land and passes to
future purchasers of land.

D. Judicial enforcement of these
requirements constitutes state ac-
tion which would raise substan-
tial questions as to the constitu-
tionality of such requirements
under the 14th Amendment.

Q

12. Azureacre is owned by Amanda as a life
tenant and Bailey as remainderman in
fee simple. Amanda and Bailey were
conveyed Azureacre subject to a mort-
gage of $100,000, payable in $10,000
installments of the principal over ten
years at ten percent interest per year
payable with each installment of the
principal. Azureacre produces $50,000
in net income per year after paying all
expenses except the mortgage. Amanda
and Bailey each dispute who should pay
the mortgage principal. If Bailey seeks
legal advice as to his obligations for
the mortgage principal of Azureacre,
he should be told:

A. He could compel Amanda to pay
the mortgage principal because
the income from Azureacre is
more than adequate to meet this
obligation.

B. Amanda could compel Bailey
to pay his share of the principal
because the discharge of the
mortgage enhances his remain-
der.

C. He could not be held person-
ally liable for the mortgage, but
Bailey's remainder could be lost
if the mortgage is not paid.

D. Bailey's only protection lies in
instituting an action for partition
to compel the sale of Amanda's
life estate to obtain the value of
his remainder. 

PROPERTY 389

C. Beatrice, because Otto's permis-
sion to occupy pre-dated Otto's
conveyance.

D. Beatrice, because Otto is Bea-
trice's landlord, not Aaron.

14. In May, Tina moved into and began
paying a monthly rental of $200 for
an apartment in a ten-unit apartment
building owned by Lulu. The hallways
and stairwells of the building needed
repair. Lulu refused to undertake those
repairs, even after Tina requested she
do so. Therefore, in late August, Tina
met with the other tenants and discussed
with them the tenants' legal options
against Lulu for failure to make repairs.
When Tina paid September's rent, Lulu
notified Tina that beginning in October,
Tina's rent would be $400 per month.
When Tina protested that all of the other
tenants were paying $200 per month,
Lulu gave Tina the statutorily-required
30-day notice to vacate the apartment.
If Tina prevails in a lawsuit contesting
the termination of her tenancy, the most
likely reason for her victory is that:

A. Her payment of monthly rental
implies the existence of a peri-
odic tenancy.

B. The rent increase from $200
to $400 is unconscionable and
will shock the conscience of the
court.

13. Otto owned Violetacre, a house and lot.
Aaron and Beatrice occupied Violetacre
rent-free with Otto's oral permission.
Both Aaron and Beatrice were 21-year-
old actors looking for acting work in
show business. Otto conveyed, properly
executed and recorded a warranty deed
to Violetacre as follows:

"To Aaron and his heirs, upon

condition that he obtain an act-
ing role in a Hollywood movie

by the time he reaches the age
of 35. However, if he does not do

so, then Violetacre is to pass to

my daughter, Della, for life, and

then to Della's two children, Ed

and Fred."

At the time of the conveyance, neither
Aaron nor Beatrice had ever acted in a
Hollywood movie. One month after the
conveyance to Aaron, Aaron informed
Beatrice that he, Aaron, was now her
landlord and expected a fair rental
each month, payable to him. Beatrice
refused. Violetacre is located in a ju-
risdiction with no statute applicable to
this situation. In a properly filed action
for ejectment of Beatrice by Aaron, the
court should award judgment for:

A. Aaron, because Otto's convey-
ance created a fee simple sub-
ject to executory limitation in
Aaron.

B. Aaron, because Otto's convey-
ance terminated Beatrice's ten-
ancy.

C. The fact that Tina would have
to pay double the rental rate
charged to other tenants violates

als for similar apartments be

D. The doctrine of retaliatory evic-
tion is part of the law of this
jurisdiction.

16. 011ie owned Blackacre, a one-acre tract
of land, in fee simple absolute. How-
ever, Paul was in adverse possession
of Blackacre. During Paul's adverse
possession, 011ie gave Agnes oral per-
mission to use the south forty feet along
Blackacre as a road to reach Whiteacre,
a tract of Agnes' land. During all times
relevant to this question, Agnes regu-
larly used Blackacre as a road to reach
Whiteacre from the public highway.

15. Indiogoacres was conveyed to Adolph
and Bette by a deed which created a
co-tenancy with equal rights of pos-
session, equal shares in interest, and
a gift of survivorship. Adolph con-
veyed to Cal his "undivided one-half
interest in Indiogoacres" to Cal. After
Adolph's death, Bette sues Cal claim-
ing Indiogoacres is her sole property.
Cal claims he is owner of an undivided
one-half of Indiogoacres. The court
should award judgment for:

A. Cal, if Bette had actual or con-
structive knowledge of Adolph's
deed to Cal.

B. Cal, since he and Bette own
Indiogoacres as tenants in com-
mon.

C. Bette, because she is the sole

owner of Indiogoacres.

D. Bette, but only if the original ten-
ancy created in Adolph and Bette
was a tenancy by the entirety.

A few years later, Paul quit possession
of Blackacre without gaining title by
adverse possession. Agnes continued
to use the south forty feet along Black-
acre from the time of her original use
for a sufficiently long period of time to
gain an easement by prescription. All
of this use was accomplished without
further communication between Agnes
and 011ie. 011ie then blocked the road
on the south forty feet along Blackacre
and has refused to permit Agnes' further
use. Agnes then sued to determine her
continued use of the road. In that law-
suit, Agnes should:

A. Win, because her use was ad-
verse to Paul and once adversely
begun, it continued in that man-
ner until some affirmative show-
ing of a change.

B. Win, because Agnes made no
attempt to renew 011ie's permis-
sion after Paul quit possession of
Blackacre.

C. Lose, because her use was per-

missive.

Questions 17 —18 are based on the
following facts:

D. Lose, because there is no evi-
dence that she continued to
adversely use Blackacre for the
required period after Paul quit
Blackacre.

Two sisters, Alice and Betty, contributed
one-half of the purchase price of Yellow-
acres, a 50-acre tract of land. They held Yel-
lowacres together as joint tenants. Five years
after the original purchase, Alice proposed
that the two sisters develop Yellowacres
as a retail shopping center. Betty did not
want to do so. She orally agreed with Alice
that Alice could alone develop the western
one-half of Yellowacres as she wished and
that Betty would do whatever she wanted
with the eastern one-half of Yellowacres.
Alice developed her retail shopping center
on the western 25 acres and Betty gave oral
permission for the Sierra Club to use the
eastern one-half of Yellowacres as a wildlife
sanctuary. Alice died, leaving her entire es-
tate, by will, to her son, Sam. The will also
named Betty executrix of Alice's estate, but
she refused to serve. 

17. In an appropriate lawsuit to determine
Sam and Betty's respective interests in
Yellowacres, if Sam is adjudicated to
be the owner of the western 25 acres of
Yellowacres, the most likely reason for
the judgment will be that:

A. Betty's actions during Alice's life
has estopped her from asserting
title to the western one-half of
Yellowacres.

B. The joint tenancy was terminated
by the oral agreement of Alice
and Betty at the time it was
made. 

392 PROPERTY

C. Betty had a fiduciary obligation
to Sam by reason of her be-
ing named executrix of Alice's
will.

D. The close blood relationship be-
tween Alice and Betty removes
the necessity to comply with the
Statute of Frauds.

18. In an appropriate lawsuit to determine
Sam and Betty's respective interests in
Yellowacres, if Betty is adjudicated to
be the sole owner of Yellowacres, the
most likely reason for the judgment will
be that:

A. The record title of the joint ten-
ancy to Yellowacres can only
be changed by a duly recorded
instrument.

B. The Statute of Frauds prevents
the proof of Betty and Alice's
oral agreement.

C. Alice could not unilaterally sever

the joint tenancy.

D. Betty's nomination as executrix
of Alice's estate does not prevent
her from asserting her claim
against Sam.

19. Baker and Selwyn entered into a valid,
enforceable written contract in which
Baker agreed to buy and Selwyn agreed
to sell Orangeacre, Selwyn's residence.
The contract contained a provision al-
lowing Selwyn the right to remain in
residence of Orangeacre for 30 days
before relinquishing possession. The
closing took place as scheduled; title
passed to Baker and Selwyn remained
in possession. A week later, however,
the house Selwyn was scheduled to
move into was destroyed. At the end
of the 30-day period, Selwyn refused
to leave Orangeacre. Instead, Selwyn
tendered to Baker a monthly rental pay-
ment in excess of the fair rental value
of Orangeacre. Baker refused the rent
and sued to gain immediate possession
of Orangeacre. There is no law of this
jurisdiction dealing with this situation
and the contract is similarly silent. The
landlord-tenant law of this jurisdiction
requires a 30-day notice by the landlord
before he can evict a tenant. Baker did
not give the 30-day statutory notice.
Baker's best legal argument in support
of his action for immediate possession
is that Selwyn is a:

A. Licensee.

B. Tenant at sufferance.

C. Tenant from month to month.

D. Trespasser ab initio.

Q

Questions 20 — 21 are based on the
following facts:

Oliver Wendell, the owner of a 100-acre tract
of land, prepared and properly recorded a
subdivision plan called the Oliver Wendell
Homes. The plan contained 40 two-acre lots
and a 20-acre tract in the southeast corner.
Oliver Wendell sold 20 of the lots to indi-
vidual purchasers. Those deeds all referred
to the recorded plan and contained the
following clause, "No multi-family dwell-
ings shall be erected within Oliver Wendell
Homes."

Abby purchased one of these original lots
from Oliver Wendell. Eight years later, Oli-
ver Wendell sold the remaining land (20 lots
and 20 acre parcel) to Beth by a deed which
referred to the plan and contained the same
clause prohibiting multi-family dwellings.
Beth then resold the 20 lots to individual
purchasers and the 20 acre parcel to Carol.
None of Beth's deeds referred to the plan,
nor contained the multi-family dwelling
restriction.

20. Assume for this question only, that
Della, a purchaser from Beth, has begun
construction of a multi-family apart-
ment building on her lot and that Abby
sues to prevent Della's apartment build-
ing. Who will prevail in this lawsuit?

A. Abby, because the restrictive
covenant in the deed runs with
the land.

B. Abby, because the apartment
building will lower Abby's land
value. 

394 PROPERTY

C. Della, because she is a remote
grantee — not a direct grantee of
Oliver Wendell.

D. Della, because she did not re-
ceive a deed containing a restric-
tive covenant.

21. Assume for this question only, that
Carol has announced her intention to
build a multifamily condominium com-
plex on the 20-acre parcel and that Abby
has sued to prevent its construction. If
Carol wins, it will be because:

A. Carol's proposed use will allow
a sufficient diversity in economic
classes in the vicinity to satisfy
the requirements of the Equal
Protection clause of the Constitu-
tion.

B. Restriction in deeds are to be
construed in favor of free alien-
ation of land and against the
grantor.

C. There has been an insufficient
showing that the common de-
velopment scheme applied to the
entire subdivision.

D. Restrictive equitable servitudes
bind only those in privity with
the original covenanting par-
ties.

Q

22. In 1960 Juan, the owner of a fee simple
absolute in Greenacres, conveyed
Greenacres to the Oak Ridge School.
The operative words of conveyance
were "to the Oak Ridge School for the
life of my daughter, Juanita, and then at
that time to all of my grandchildren and
their heirs in equal shares; provided,
however, that the Oak Ridge School
shall use Greenacres for school purpos-
es only." After the conveyance, the Oak
Ridge School began holding classes on
Greenacres and has continued to do so
for all relevant times.

In 1980, Oak Ridge School granted
Shelly a right to mine and remove
minerals from the northwest portion
of Greenacres. Shelly began to remove
minerals under this grant.

All three of the present grandchildren
of Juan, as well as a guardian ad litem,
appointed to represent Juan's unborn
grandchildren, have sued the Oak Ridge
School and Shelly for damages and
injunction for the mining operations
on Greenacres. There is no applicable
statute. Which of the following best
describes the probable outcome of the
litigation?

A. Plaintiffs should prevail, since
the Oak Ridge School's interest
terminated the instant Shelly
began mining operations on
Greenacres.

B. The judge should grant the in-
junction, but not award damages
since Juan and Juanita are not
parties to the lawsuit.

C. The judge should award dam-
ages, but not the injunction.

D. The judge should grant the in-
junction and impound the dam-
ages to be awarded.

23. Maria owned three condos in Condo
Heaven, numbers 6, 7 and 21. The price
and fair market value of condos 6 and 7
was $50,000, and number 21, $75,000.
Nellie was interested in purchasing a
condo in Condo Heaven but couldn't
decide between #6 or #7. Therefore,
Nellie gave Maria $50,000 and Ma-
ria prepared and executed a deed to
Nellie for a condo in Condo Heaven,
complete in every way except that the
unit number was left blank. Maria told
Nellie to fill in unit #6 or #7 as she
wished and then Nellie should record
the deed. The next day, Nellie went to
Condo Heaven, filled in unit #21 in the
deed and recorded the deed. In an action
by Maria to rescind the transaction, if
Maria loses, the most likely reason for
that judgment is that:

A. The necessity for certainty in
land title records controls.

B. The agency implied to complete
the deed cannot be restricted by
the oral understanding.

In an action to determine the property
rights in Beigeacres, it was alleged that
the gifts to Harold's grandchildren were
void and that the interests in Beigeacres,
after Dolly's children's life estates
passed to Harold's children, passed
absolutely under the residuary clause of
the will. Assuming a properly instituted
action with all parties represented, the
judge should decide that:

A. The attempted gifts to the grand-
children are void as restraints on
alienation.

B. The attempted gifts to the grand-
children are void under the Rule
Against Perpetuities.

C. The attempted gifts to the grand-
children are valid except for the
provisions against sale, convey-
ance or mortgage.

D. The attempted gifts to the grand-
children are entirely valid and
will be enforced as written.

C. The recordation of the deed

24. In 1980, Harold willed Beigeacres as

follows:

"To my daughter, Dolly, and at

her death to those of Dolly's chil-

dren who survive her, provided,

however, that no such child of

Dolly shall have the power to con-

vey, sell or mortgage such child's

interest prior to attaining the age

of 30 years; and if any such child

of Dolly shall not comply with
this provision then that child's

interest shall determine and pass

to the remaining children of Dolly

alive at that time, share and share

alike."

Harold's 1980 will devised Whiteacres
to his son, Solomon, in an identical
manner. The residuary clause in the
1980 will gave the residual estate to
Harold's two children, Dolly and Solo-
mon, equally. In 1990, Harold died sur-
vived by Dolly and Solomon and their
two children each. Since 1990, Dolly
has had one additional child.

25. Thelma Jones and Louis Boggs lived
together for ten years. They never for-
mally married, although they always
referred to each other as husband and
wife, and Thelma always identified
herself as Thelma Boggs or Mrs. Louis
Boggs. During this time, they decided
to purchase a home. The deed was in
proper form and identified the grantees
as "Thelma and Louis Boggs, as hus-
band and wife, and their heirs forever,
as tenants by the entirety." Thelma
provided a down payment and she and
Louis gave a mortgage for the balance.
The mortgage was signed by both
Thelma and Louis, as husband and wife.
Thelma made payments on the loan for
one year, until she abandoned Louis and
the house and moved to another state.
Louis made one further mortgage pay-
ment after Thelma's departure and then
sued for partition. The suit for partition
should be:

A. Denied, since no single tenant by
the entirety has a right to sue for
partition.

B. Denied, since Thelma has sole

title to the property.

C. Granted, because the tenancy by
the entirety that was created by
the deed was destroyed when
Thelma abandoned Louis.

D. Granted, because the deed never
created a tenancy by the en-
tirety.

Cross."

In 1991, Fred was alive and had two
children, Barney and Betty. In an appro-
priate action to determine the interests
in Redacres, the gift to Fred's children
shall be held to be:

A. An executory interest.

B. A vested remainder subject to

complete divestment.

C. An indefeasible vested remain-

Carla dies before the real estate clos-
ing and her will gives her real property
to Ricky and her personal property to
Paula. Assume further, that the contract
is otherwise fully performed. Which
statement is most correct?

A. Ricky has the right to specifically

perform the contract.

B. Bernie has the right to can-
cel the contract and refuse the
$50,000.

C. Since the land sale contract
could have provided for the con-
tingency of death of one of the
parties but did not do so, death
terminates the contract.

D. The death of the buyer renders
title to Blueacres unmarketable.

Questions 27 — 28 are based on the
following facts:

Bernie is the owner of Blueacres, a tract of
land. In 1990, he contracted to sell Blueacres
to Carla. Bernie and Carla executed an agree-
ment for Carla to purchase Blueacres from
Bernie for $50,000 cash. Assume Blueacres
is located in a jurisdiction which recognizes
the principle of equitable estoppel, but has
no statute specifically dealing with these
problems.

27. Assume for this question only, that
Bernie dies before the real estate clos-
ing and his will leaves his real property
to Rhoda and his personal property to
Peter. Assume further that the contract
is otherwise fully performed. Which
statement is correct?

A. Rhoda is entitled to the $50,000
on closing since equitable con-
version is inapplicable here.

B. Peter is entitled to the $50,000 on
closing since equitable conver-
sion applies here.

C. Since the land sale contract
could have provided for the con-
tingency of death of one of the
parties but did not do so, death
terminates the contract.

Questions 29 — 30 are based on the
following facts:

In 1975, Wanda gave a deed to her boyfriend,
Bill, containing the covenant of general war-
ranty, quiet enjoyment and right to convey.
That deed contained legal descriptions of
land as follows:

C. Is enforceable, because no ambi-
guity appears on the face of the
deed.

D. Is sufficient, if Bill paid consid-

eration.

30. The legal description of 1313 Mocking-

bird Lane is:

(a)

"All of my land and house

known commonly as 1313 Mock-

ingbird Lane, Addamsville, United

States, the same comprising 3/4 of

an acre."

"All that part of my ranch, be-

(b)
ing a square with 600 foot sides,

the northeast corner of which is

the west line of my neighbor, Ru-

fus Choate."

On the date of the deed, Wanda handed the
document to Bill who immediately gave
it back to Wanda for safekeeping. Wanda
took the deed to her bank and put it in her
safe-deposit box. The deed was not re-
corded. As it turns out, the property at 1313
Mockingbird Lane was, in fact, only 5/8 of
an acre but contained a house, garage and
tool shed. Wanda owned no other land on
Mockingbird Lane.

29. The legal description of the portion of

Wanda's ranch given to Bill:

A. Is insufficient, because of vague-

ness.

B. Is enforceable, if the deed con-
tinued the covenant of seisin.

A. Insufficient, because it contains
no description by metes and
bounds.

B. Insufficient, because the acreage

given is inaccurate.

C. Insufficient, because a grantor
cannot convey more than she
owns.

D. Sufficient, because the discrep-

ancy in area is not fatal.

31. Ethel was the fee simple owner of Weed-
acres (a vacant tract of land). Weedacres
was located adjacent to Hedgeacres,
a tract of land with a house and barn
located on it and owned in fee simple
by Fred. In 1990, Ethel began digging a
foundation for a building on Weedacres
to be located near the property line with
Hedgeacres. Ethel's digging caused the
barn and land on Hedgeacres to collapse
due to earth movement. In a lawsuit by
Fred against Ethel for damages to his
barn and land, due to Ethel's excava-
tion, the prevailing party should be:

PROPERTY

399

A. Fred, because he has an absolute
right to lateral support of his
land.

B. Fred, unless the weight of the
barn contributed to the damage.

C. Ethel, but only if she was negli-

gent in her excavation.

D. Ethel, unless her excavation
would have caused the same
damage to unimproved land, or
she was negligent.

32. Francisco owned Farmacres (a tract of
land) in fee simple absolute. He con-
veyed it "to Gilbert for life, and then
to the children of Helen in fee simple."
At the time of the conveyance, both
Gilbert and Helen were alive; neither
had any children. What interest, if any,
was created in Helen's unborn children
at the time of the conveyance?

A. A vested remainder, subject to

partial divestment.

B. A contingent remainder.

C. An executory interest.

D. None.

Questions 33 — 34 are based on the
following facts:

Quintin was the owner of Sandacres (a large
tract of undeveloped land) in fee simple
absolute. In 1970, he subdivided Sandacres
into 3 parcels, #1-3. Quintin conveyed lot
#1 to Rhoda, lot #2 (the middle lot) to Susan
and lot #3, he retained as vacant land for
speculation. Rhoda and Susan built houses
and swimming pools on their lots. The land
around Sandacres was undeveloped, unim-
proved and unzoned. After their houses were
built, Rhoda and Susan agreed to build and
jointly construct a sewer line running from
the street in front of their houses along the
common property line to the rear of their
respective lots and connecting into each
house. The sewer line was so constructed
that one half of the line was located on each
lot. Rhoda and Susan exchanged sewer ease-
ment grants by which each of them granted
to the other, her heirs and assigns, the right
to use and maintain the common sewer line.
Both documents were properly recorded.

In 1990, the area surrounding Sandacres was
more developed and the city government
decided to install and maintain a new sewer
line running along the rear of the three lots.
That new line removed the need for the com-
mon line constructed by Rhoda and Susan.
Rhoda informed Susan that she considered
the new sewer line to be a replacement for
the old common line, that she intended to
discontinue use of the common line and that
she expected Susan to do the same. In 1990,
Quintin decided to develop lot #3 into a
high-rise condominium building, containing
20 stories and 200 units. If developed in that
way, Quintin's building would completely  

shade Susan's swimming pool, for all but
forty minutes a day. This change would
substantially affect the fair market value of
Susan's lot.

33. If Susan sues Rhoda to enjoin Rhoda
from interfering with Susan's contin-
ued use of the common sewer line, the
prevailing party will be:

A. Rhoda, because the termination
of the necessity for the sewer
easement terminated the ease-
ment.

B. Rhoda, because the continued use
of the common easement after a
material change in circumstances
would diminish the fair market
value of the lots, without a cor-
responding and commensurate
increase in value.

C. Susan, because an incorporeal
hereditament lies in grant and
cannot be terminated without a
writing.

D. Susan, because the termination
of the necessity for the ease-
ment which had been created by
express grant does not affect the
rights in the easement.

34. If Susan sues Quintin to enjoin him from
erecting the high-rise condominium in
such a way to shade Susan's swimming
pool, the prevailing party will be:

Q

A. Susan, if, and only if, she was
misled by Quintin's failure to
complain when she was building
her pool.

B. Susan, because Quintin's build-
ing would be an unreasonable
obstruction with her natural right
to an easement for light, air or
view.

C. Quintin, because Susan has no
natural right to an easement for
air, light or view. 

D. Quintin, if, and only if, he can
show that his intention to build
in this manner was known to
Susan before or at the time she
received her conveyance from
the common grantor, Quintin.

36. In a lawsuit by Victoria against Wilma
to establish that Victoria has title to
Plantacres, if Victoria loses, it will be
because:

A. Parol evidence is inadmissible to
prove an oral condition rebutting
valid delivery.

B. As between the parties to a trans-
action, recording is not required
to transfer title after a valid de-
livery.

C. Wilma has proven that Victoria
intended to part with Plantacres
irrevocably.

D. This is a donative escrow, which
creates consideration for the
transfer through the relationship
of blood or marriage.

Questions 35 — 36 are based on the
following facts:

Victoria was the fee simple owner of Planta-
cres (a vacant tract of land). On January 1,
1990, she went to the house of her 30-year-
old daughter, Wilma. In her daughter's
presence, Victoria executed a warranty deed
to Plantacres and said, "Here is a deed to
Plantacres which I am giving you as a gift."
Wilma thanked her mother, and Victoria
took the deed and subsequently placed it in
her (Victoria's) safe deposit box. In 1993,
Victoria received an offer from Xenaphon to
purchase Plantacres for several times the cur-
rent market value. The recording act in this
jurisdiction states that unless a conveyance
or other transfer of land is duly recorded,
every deed or other conveyance of an interest
in land is void as to a subsequent purchaser
for value in good faith who records.

35. In a lawsuit by Victoria against Wilma
to establish that Victoria has title to
Plantacres, if Wilma loses it will be
because:

A. The events of January 1, 1990
were a conditional delivery to a
grantee without an escrow.

B. Wilma is a donee and not a bona
fide purchaser under the record-
ing act.

C. The events of January 1, 1990
were insufficient to constitute a
valid delivery.

D. Wilma did not record her deed as
required by the recording act.

37. Ursula conveyed Vineacres (a house
and tract of land) "to Will for life, re-
mainder to Xerxes and his heirs, subject
to a first mortgage in favor of First Fed-
eralist Savings and Loan for $100,000."
The mortgage had an unpaid balance of
$100,000, payable in monthly install-
ments of $1,000 plus interest at 8%
on the balance. The next payment of
principal and interest is due May 1. The
reasonable rental value of the property
is greater than the sum necessary to
meet all current charges. Will is cur-
rently living on the property. Assume
that the common law rules governing
contributions between life tenants and
remaindermen apply in this state. How
should the burden for repayment of the
first mortgage to First Federalist Sav-
ings and Loan be allocated between
Will and Xerxes?

A. Will must pay both the principal

and interest.

B. Xerxes must pay both principal

and interest.

C. Will must pay the principal and
Xerxes must pay the interest.

D. Xerxes must pay the principal
and Will must pay the interest.

38. Yvette conveys Bambooacres (a tract
of land) to Zerlina by warranty deed as
a gift for Zerlina's birthday. One year
later, Yvette conveys the same property,
Bambooacres, to Abelia for $100,000.
Abelia is without constructive or actual
knowledge of the prior deed to Zerlina.
Abelia records her deed to Bamboo-
acres first. Abelia receives the property
pursuant to the recording act in this
jurisdiction. If Zerlina sues Yvette for
having lost the property to Abelia, the
outcome of Zerlina's lawsuit against
Yvette will depend on:

A. Whether Yvette's warranty deed
to Zerlina was invalid ab initio.

B. Whether deeds without cov-
enants are sufficient to transfer
title to real property.

C. Whether the jurisdiction views
title covenants as personal or
running with the land.

D. Whether Zerlina is a bona fide

purchaser.

39. Benjy owned Bushacres (a tract of land)
in fee simple absolute. He conveyed
Bushacres in 1954 "to Carla and Dan, as
wife and husband." In this jurisdiction,
Benjy's conveyance would be sufficient
to create a tenancy by the entirety.
Thereafter, Carla conveyed by a deed
in valid form and delivery "my undi-
vided one-half interest in Bushacres"
to Esther. Carla died one year later. If
Esther sues Dan to quiet title in himself
and herself as co-owners of Bushacres,
she will:

A. Not prevail, unless Carla and
Dan were not legally married
according to the laws in this
jurisdiction during the relevant
times in this problem.

B. Not prevail, because he is the

sole owner of Bushacres.

C. Prevail, if, and only if, Esther had
no actual or constructive notice
of the deed to Dan and Carla.

D. Prevail, since Esther and Dan
own Bushacres as tenants in

Questions 40 — 41 are based on the
following facts:

In 1978, Fiona owned Palmacres (a tract of
land) in fee simple absolute. In that year, she
executed and delivered to Gus a quitclaim
deed which purported to convey to Gus all
Fiona's interest and title in Palmacres. Gus
accepted the deed and placed it in his bank
safe deposit box. In satisfaction of a prior
debt she owed to Hal, Fiona executed and
delivered a warranty deed to Hal also pur-
porting to convey full fee title to Palmacres
in full release of her obligation to him. Hal
promptly recorded his deed. Two years
later, Gus recorded his deed. At no time has
there been evidence of any occupation of
Palmacres. Assume that provisions of the
recording statute in this jurisdiction require
that a junior claimant be in good faith and
have provided value in order to claim protec-
tion of the recording act.

40. The recording act in this jurisdiction

may be:

I. Race

II. Race-Notice

III. Notice

A. I or II.

B. II or III.

C. I or III.

D. None of the above. 

41. Which is the most accurate statement
regarding the conflicting claims to
Palmacres of Gus and Hal?

A. Gus cannot prevail, since he
received a quitclaim deed which
automatically puts him on notice
and, thus, not in good faith.

B. Gus' failure to record until after
Hal, equitably estops Gus from
asserting title against Hal (but
not against Fiona).

C. The outcome will turn on wheth-
er Hal paid value within the
meaning of the recording act.

D. None of the above.

42. Quincy was the owner of Shrubacres
(a tract of land) in fee simple absolute.
In 1950, he conveyed the property "to
Randy and her heirs as long as the prop-
erty is used for residential purposes, but
if it is ever used for non-residential pur-
poses prior to 1970, then to UNICEF, a
charity." In 1964, Quincy died leaving
a valid will which devised all Quincy's
real property to her niece, Selma. The
will had no residuary clause and Quincy
was survived by Selma and Quincy's
son Ted, her sole heir. Assume that the
common law Rule Against Perpetuities
applies and that all future interests are
alienable, devisable, and descendible
in the same manner as possessory in-
terests in land. In 1951, the interest in
Shrubacres held by UNICEF could have
best been described as a (an):

Questions 43 — 46 are based on the
following facts:

Lana owned Pineacres (a tract of vacant
land) in fee simple absolute. The recording
act for this jurisdiction states that unless a
conveyance or other transfer of land is duly
recorded, every deed or other conveyance of
an interest in land is void as to a subsequent
purchaser for value in good faith. In 1970,
Lana sold Pineacres in fee simple for fair
market value to Max by general warranty
deed. Max recorded his deed in 1985. In
1975, Lana signed a mortgage to Pineacres
in favor of Nancy in return for money lent
by Nancy to Lana. Nancy was without ac-
tual notice of the prior deed to Max. She
recorded her mortgage immediately. In 1980,
Lana gratuitously gave her then-boyfriend,
Oliver, a fee simple, general warranty deed
to Pineacres. Oliver promptly recorded
his deed. In 1990, Oliver conveyed a fee
simple to Pineacres at full fair market value
by general warranty deed to Pedro. Pedro
had no actual knowledge of any of the prior
transactions in Pineacres. Pedro promptly
recorded his deed.

43. Assume for this question only, that in
1995 Max sues Nancy claiming that
Max owns the property and that Nancy
does not. The prevailing party owning
Pineacres will be:

A. Max, because a mortgagee can-
not be a subsequent purchaser

ute.

B. Max, because a mortgagee can-
not be deemed to have paid
value within the meaning of the

C. Nancy, because she recorded

D. Nancy, because she lent money

in Pineacres.

44. Assume for this question only, that in
1995 Max sues Pedro claiming that
Max owns the property and that Pedro
does not. If Pedro prevails, it will be
because:

A. As between two warranty deeds,
the subsequent one controls.

B. Oliver, Pedro's grantor, had no
notice of Max's interest in Pine-
acres.

C. Max's prior recorded deed is
outside Pedro's chain of title.

D. Oliver, Pedro's grantor, recorded

before Max.

45. Assume for this question only, that in
1989 Max sued Oliver claiming that
Max owned Pineacres and that Oliver

Max; she gave it to him free of charge.
Assume also that Max did not receive
a general warranty deed, but received
a quitclaim. Assume further, that in
1989 Max sued Oliver claiming that
Max owned Pineacres and that Oliver
did not. The prevailing party owning
Pineacres should have been:

A. Oliver, because Oliver's deed

B. Oliver, because Max was not a

C. Oliver, because Max received
a quitclaim deed which should

47. Irene leased her house and surround-
ing yard to Juan for fifteen years. The
lease contained a clause prohibiting
Juan from assigning his interest in the
lease. Kris has approached Juan about
subletting the house and yard to him.
May Juan do so?

A. Yes, because restraints on alien-

ation are invalid.

B. Yes, because a lease term pro-
hibiting assignments is strictly
construed.

C. No, because the term "assign-
ment" includes "subleasing" and
vice versa.

D. No, because a tenant can never
assign or sublease without the
landlord's permission, since to
do so would be to impair the
landlord's security interest in the
property.

floor-to-ceiling oak bookcases, which he se-
curely bolted to the wall next to the fireplace.
He also replaced the old wooden steps lead-

privilege was exclusive against all
others except Yetta, who reserved the
right to use Wheatacres for any purpose
whatsoever, including harvesting all the

Adam is the fee simple owner of Oakacres
(a tract of land) located next to the Elmacres,
a tract of land which he also owned in fee

Boris in return for a promise in that same
document that Boris would not construct
anything other than a single-family dwelling
on Elmacres. In 1985, Adam sold Oakacres
to Carole. In 1990, Boris sold Elmacres to
Della. With the promise in force, Oakacres
is worth $100,000. If Elmacres is used for

$1,000. Assume further that in 1991,
Della built a multiple-family apartment
house on Elmacres. In a lawsuit for
$40,000 (damages to compensate Car-
ole for the fact that Della did not honor
the 1980 agreement), Carole should:

A. Win, because Della broke the

1980 promise.

59. Ginny is the fee simple owner of
Strawacres (a tract of land). In 1980,
Ginny built a house on Strawacres and
began occupying the property. In 1992,
because she had never had a place to
park her car before, Ginny built a garage
on Strawacres. In 1991, she conveyed
the mineral rights to the land beneath
Strawacres to Horace, who immediately
began mining the minerals. Horace
enlarged his mining operations under
Strawacres, in 1993, until his exca-
vation caused subsidence damage to
Ginny's house and garage. In a lawsuit
by Ginny against Horace for subsidence
damage to her house and garage on
Strawacres, if Ginny cannot prove that
Horace negligently excavated beneath
Strawacres, she will recover:

A. Nothing.

B. Damages for the house, but not

for the garage.

C. Damages for the garage, but not

for the house.

D. Damages for the house and ga-

rage.

60. Chad owned Treeacres (a tract of land)
in fee simple absolute. He conveyed it
"to Della, her heirs and assigns; pro-
vided that if my sister, Ellen, should
ever have a son, then to that son, his
heirs and assigns." The limitation to
Ellen's "son, his heirs and assigns" is:

plete divestment.

B. Valid, because the Rule Against
Perpetuities does not apply to
Ellen's son's interest

C. Valid, because Ellen's son's in-

63. Ellen was the owner of Whiteacre, a
tract of land which she owned in fee
simple absolute. In 1950, Ellen con-
veyed Whiteacre as follows: "to Fran-
cisco for life, and then to Francisco's
children for life, and then to Francisco's
grandchildren." In 1950, Francisco was
40-years-old and had two living chil-
dren, Guadalupe and Hortensia, but no
grandchildren. In 1952, another daugh-
ter of Francisco, Isabella was born, but
Isabella only lived until 1982. Which of
Francisco's grandchildren may receive
an interest under Ellen's 1950 convey-
ance?

A. The children, if any, of Guada-
lupe, Hortensia and Isabella,
since the "all or nothing" rule
applies.

B. The children, if any, of Guada-
lupe and Hortensia, but not Isa-
bella, since Isabella was born af-
ter the date of the conveyance. 

Questions 61— 62 are based on the
following facts:

In 1980, Albertine conveyed Blackacre,
which she owned in fee simple absolute,
"to Benny and Carl, jointly and forever."
In 1990, Benny died, willing Blackacre to
Della. Carl, believing himself to be the sole
owner of Blackacre, lived on Blackacre and
paid all property taxes.

61. In 1990, after Benny's death, the title

to the property is held:

A. By Carl only.

B. By Della only.

C. By Carl and Della as joint ten-

ants.

D. By Carl and Della as tenants in

common.

62. Assume for this question only, that
Carl and Della are tenants in common.
In 1993, if Della sues Carl for an ac-
counting as a result of that action, Della
will:

A. Owe 1/2 of the property taxes
paid by Carl, but receive an
offset for the fair market rental
value of Carl's use of the prop-
erty.

B. Owe 1/2 of the property taxes
paid by Carl, but not receive an
offset for the fair market rental
value of Carl's use of the prop-
erty.

C. The children, if any, of Isabella
only, since in a per stirpes dis-
tribution, each child will receive
his or her deceased parent's

D. None, since the "all or nothing"

rule applies.

64. In 1960, Joe was the owner of Blueacre,
a tract of land which he owned in fee
simple absolute. In that year he died,
willing Blueacre "to Kermit for life,
then to Kermit's children for life, and
then to Kermit's heirs." In 1960, Ker-
mit had one child. Kermit's interest in
Blueacre, after this devise, is a:

A. Life estate.

B. Fee simple absolute.

C. Life estate and a vested remain-

der.

65. Larry is the fee simple absolute owner
of Greenacre, a tract of land with a
house located in the state of Columbia.
In 1980, Larry was 18 and lived with
his parents in the state of Marbury,
100 miles away from Greenacre. In
1980, Maxella moved into the house
on Greenacre, planted a vegetable
garden, paid all taxes and assessments
on Greenacre, and received mail and
telephone service at that address. In
1982, Larry suffered a traumatic injury,
became insane and was committed to a
psychiatric hospital. The age of major-
ity in Columbia is 21. Assuming that
Columbia follows the common law of
real property, when, if ever, does Max-
ella gain title to Greenacre?

Questions 66 — 68 are based on the
following facts:

Laurette leased to Ted 400 square feet of of-
fice space and four parking spaces in a park-
ing garage to be constructed next door to the
leased office building. That lease contained
a covenant by Ted to pay Laurette $200 per
month for a term of three years, and another
covenant to paint and maintain the parking
spaces in conformance with city codes. The
lease also prohibited assignments and/or
subleases without the prior permission of
the landlord. Six months after Ted signed
the lease, the parking garage was completed
and Ted began the rental term and moved
into the office. One year into his lease, Ted
transferred his interest in the office and
parking spaces to Tina. Laurette wrote a
letter to Tina, stating that she (Laurette) ac-
cepted Tina as an assignee under the lease.
After nine months, however, Tina moved
out and transferred her interest in the office
and parking spaces to Tomasso, who moved
into the property.

66. Assume for this question only, that
Laurette refused to accept Tomasso as
a tenant and accepted no money from
him. If Tomasso sues Laurette to force
her to accept him as a tenant, Tomasso's
best argument would be that:

A. Lease covenants are strictly con-
strued against the landlord.

B. A covenant prohibiting assign-
ments does not prohibit sub-
leases, and vice versa. 

416 PROPERTY

C. The Rule in Dumpor's case re-
quires the landlord to accept this
assignment.

D. The Rule in Spencer's case re-
quires the landlord to accept this
assignment.

67. Assume for this question only, that To-
masso pays rent to Laurette who accepts
it, but that Tomasso refuses to maintain
the parking spaces according to the city
code. If Laurette sues Tomasso for dam-
ages under the lease provision regarding
the maintenance of the parking spaces
and Laurette loses, it will most likely
be because:

A. A covenant concerning a thing
not yet in existence must ex-
pressly mention assignees in
order to bind them.

B. There is no horizontal privity for

the covenant.

C. The benefit of the covenant does
not increase or enhance the value
of the land or the landlord's es-
tate therein.

D. The burden of the covenant does
not curtail the use of the land or
diminish the value of the tenant's
estate therein.

68. Assume for this question only, that
Laurette accepted Tomasso as an as-
signee, but that Tomasso never moved
in. Assume further, that neither Tina nor
Tomasso ever paid rent. At the end of
the lease term, Laurette may collect:

A. $3000 from Tomasso, under

privity of contract.

B. $3000 from Tomasso, under

privity of estate.

C. $4800 from Tina, under privity

of contract.

D. $1800 from Tina, under privity

of estate.

69. In 1990, Nevill is the fee simple ab-
solute owner of Yellowacre, a tract of
land with a house located in the state of
Franklin. In 1990, Olive moved into the
house on Yellowacre and lived in that
house intermittently for twenty years,
without Nevill's permission. Assuming
that Franklin follows the common law
of real property, after the twenty year
period, who holds title to Yellowacre?

A. Olive, because intermittent use
is consistent with the nature of
the property.

B. Olive, if intermittent use is
consistent with the nature of the

C. Nevill, because intermittent use

Questions 70 — 73 are based on the
following facts:

Owen was the fee simple absolute owner of
Redacres, a twenty acre tract of land. Owen
contracted to sell Redacres to Albert in fee
simple absolute, for $40,000, by warranty
deed. After the close of escrow and delivery
of the warranty deed to Albert in fee simple
absolute, Albert discovered that Owen was
not the sole owner of Redacre; he was a ten-
ant in common with Lee. The value of that
land as a sole interest was $40,000; the value
of that land as an undivided 1/2, as tenant in
common, was $15,000.

70. Assume for this question only, that
Albert sues Owen in a timely manner
for breach of the covenant of seisin. If
Albert prevails, his damages will be:

A. $20,000.

B. $25,000.

C. $40,000.

D. $50,000.

72. Assume for this question only, that
Albert remained unaware of Owen's
tenancy in common interest in Redacres
with Lee. Albert then sold Redacres by
warranty deed for $50,000 to Bea. After
Bea paid the money to Albert and ac-
cepted the deed, Lee sued Bea to quiet
title in himself as a tenant in common
in Redacres with Bea. If Bea then sues
Albert for breach of one of the cov-
enants for title in the Albert-Bea deed,
Bea will recover:

A. $15,000.

B. $20,000.

C. $25,000.

D. $40,000.

71. Assume for this question only, that Al-
bert purchased a title insurance policy
for $50,000 on the property, but that the
title insurance company did not disclose
to Albert the fact that Owen only owned
a tenancy in common interest in Red-
acres. That fact was discovered by the
title insurance company during its title
search. If Albert sues the title insurance
company and prevails, his damages will
be:

A. $20,000.

B. $25,000.

C. $40,000.

D. $50,000.

73. Assume the same facts as in question
72, except that the deed from Albert to
Bea was a quitclaim deed. If Bea sues
Owen for breach of one of the title
covenants, her damages will be:

A. $0, she received a quitclaim

deed.

74. In 1950, Paulette, the fee simple owner
of Purpleacres, conveyed Purpleacres, a
house and farm in the state of Madison,
"to Quintin for life, then to Rula in fee

Purpleacres. Instead, in 1951, Sara did
so and used the property as her own. In
1966, Quintin died. Rula never moved

In 1930, Lee, the fee simple absolute owner,
conveyed Violetacres "to Harry for life, then
to Lee's heirs." In 1940, Mark, the fee simple
absolute owner, conveyed Indigoacres "to
Harry as long as California requires attorneys
to pass the California Bar Examination." In
1950, Nell, the fee simple absolute owner,
conveyed Purpleacres "to Harry forever." In
1960, Harry married Wendy. In 1970, Harry
died; willing all his real property to Oscar.
Violetacres, Indigoacres and Purpleacres are
all located in the state of Adams, and Adams
retains the law pertaining to dower.

78. If Wendy sues to claim her dower
interest in Harry's property, in which

est?

I. Violetacres.

II. Indigoacres.

III. Purpleacres.

A. I, II and III.

B. I and II only.

C. II and III only.

D. Neither I, II nor III.

79. If Wendy sues to receive her dower

A. A fee simple absolute in all

seised lands.

B. A life estate in all seised lands.

C. A 1/2 interest in all seised

80. Bella orally agreed to purchase, and Sal-
ly agreed to sell Greyacre for $100,000.
The parties reduced the agreement to a
writing which contained all of the ele-
ments required by the statute of frauds,
except that there was no mention of the
$100,000 purchase price (upon which
Sally and Bella agreed.) Sally has re-
fused to consummate the transaction
and deliver a deed to Greyacre. In an
action for specific performance by Bella
against Sally, Sally has claimed the
statute of frauds as a aefense. If Bella
offers into evidence the above described
written agreement, and also credible
evidence that the parties discussed and
agreed upon the $100,000 purchase
price, Bella's lawsuit for specific per-
formance will:

A. Succeed, because the law will
imply that the reasonable market
value of Greyacre was discussed
and agreed upon by the contract-
ing parties — even if the fair mar-
ket value was not the purchase
price orally agreed upon.  

Q

0
m

B. Succeed, because if the price
agreed upon is a fair and equi-
table one, the seller is estopped
from pleading the statute of
frauds as a defense and that term
may be implied into the written
memorandum.

C. Fail, because Bella has not of-
fered evidence that $100,000
is the fair market value of Grey-
acre.

D. Fail, because price is an essential
element of a written memoran-
dum necessary to satisfy the
statute of frauds.

Questions 87 — 89 are based on the
following facts:

In 1960, Juan was the fee simple owner of
Taupeacres, a tract of land with a house on
it. In 1961, the telephone company requested
and received a written agreement from Juan
giving the company the right to install and
maintain telephone poles and wires across
Taupeacres. The telephone company did
in fact install poles and wires across Tau-
peacres.

87. If in 1972 Juan sues to remove the
telephone wires from Taupeacres and
he loses, it will probably be because:

A. The telephone company has a

license.

B. The telephone company has an

easement.

C. The telephone company has
gained title to Taupeacres by
prescription.

D. The telephone company has an
easement by necessity, since
phone service is necessary in
today's society.

88. Assume for this question only, that in
1975 the telephone company permitted
a cable television company to place
its cables on the telephone company's
poles which crossed Taupeacres. If Juan
sues to prevent the cable company's use
of his land, Juan's best argument will

1961 agreement between Juan and the
telephone company was oral instead of
written. If in 1972 Juan sues the tele-
phone company to force the company
to remove its poles and wires from
Taupeacres and Juan loses, it will most
likely be because:

A. The telephone company has a

424 PROPERTY

In 1960, Chad, the fee simple owner of
Magentaacres, a tract of land, conveyed that
property "to the school board to be used for
school purposes only." The school board
accepted the gift and constructed a school
on the property in 1961. The school board
continued to use the property as a school
until 1993, when due to a population shift
in the community, the school board decided
to level the school building and construct a
gas station/mini-market on Magentaacres.
All parties concede that the property has not
been used for school purposes since 1993.

90. In 1994, the school board seeks to quiet
title to Magentaacres in itself. A court
will most likely quiet title to the prop-
erty in:

A. The school board, in fee simple

absolute.

B. The school board, but only until
Chad retakes the property.

C. Chad, in fee simple absolute.

D. Chad, but only if it is not eco-
nomically efficient to continue to
use Magentaacres as a school.

91. For which interest in land should Chad's
lawyer argue, in order to retain for Chad
the greatest possible rights in Magenta-
acres, as a result of this conveyance?

A. A right of entry. 

B. A power of termination.

C. A possibility of reverter.

Questions 92 — 93 are based on the
following facts:   

Louisa leased an apartment to Tilly for
twenty-four months, beginning January 1,
1991. The lease was in writing and provided
for an annual rental of $4,800, payable in 12
monthly installments. On January 1, 1991,
Louisa handed the keys to the apartment to
Tilly. However, the previous tenant, Tom,
was still in possession of the apartment. 

92. The type of tenancy created in Tilly by

the lease agreement was a:

A. Periodic tenancy, whose term is
month-to-month because of the
monthly rental installments.

B. Periodic tenancy, whose term is
year-to-year because the lease
states an annual rental term of
$4,800.

C. Tenancy at will, which is turned
into a periodic tenancy by the
acceptance of rent.

D. Tenancy for years, because a
definite ending date is provided
in the lease.

93. If Tilly sues Louisa claiming a violation
of the landlord's duties towards a ten-
ant because of the continued presence
of Tom in the apartment, Tilly, under
modern law, should:

A. Win, because Tilly is entitled to
actual possession of the estate
promised by Louisa.

B. Win, because Louisa's lease
with Tilly is an election by the
landlord to treat Tom's tenancy
at sufferance as a trespass.

C. Lose, because Tilly, as the owner
of the non-freehold estate, is
entitled to possession of the
apartment and therefore is the
only one entitled to sue Tom in
ejectment.

D. Lose, because Louisa has fully
delivered the legal right to pos-
session to Tilly.

Questions 94 — 95 are based on the
following facts:

In 1960, Bo owned twenty acres with a house
on the south 1/2 of the property. Bo cleared
a dirt road from the house to the only public
road which ran along the north frontage of
the property. In 1970, Bo gave, by warranty
deed, the north 1/2 of the property to Celia
and kept for himself the south 1/2 with the
house. Bo continued to use the dirt road to
reach the public highway.

94. In 1989, if Bo is able to use the dirt
road access Celia's property over her
objections, it is because he has an:

I. Easement by Implica-

Minny and Nora are owners of adjoining
land. In 1970, Minny promises Nora that
Minny will maintain her land forever, as a
single-family residence, only. That promise
was made in writing and was recorded with
the county recorders office. In 1975, Nora
conveyed her property to Peter, who did not
have actual knowledge of the promise.  

96. Assume for this question only, that in
1980 Minny develops her land as a
multiple-family apartment complex.
If Peter sues Minny for damages for
breaching the 1970 Minny-Nora prom-
ise, Peter will:

A. Win, because the covenant runs

with the land.

B. Lose, because there is no vertical

privity.

C. Lose, because there is no hori-

a period of three years beginning
November 1, 1990. On November 5,
1993, Tilly was still in possession of
Brownacres without obtaining Larry's
prior consent to her continued presence
on the property. As of that date, she has
not paid Larry any money for her pos-
session of Brownacres after October
31, 1993. Before Larry decides what
legal action to take with respect to
Tilly's continued presence on Browna-

not.

102. Bernice agreed in writing to buy
Sarah's land. Since Bernice did not
have enough cash to pay the purchase
price immediately, they entered into
the following land security device
agreement. Their agreement stated that
Bernice would pay Sarah a monthly
percentage of the total purchase price
plus interest each month until the total
price and accrued interest was paid.
Bernice had the legal right to posses-
sion of the property and the obligation
to pay taxes, etc. on it. As security for
the money owed, Sarah would transfer
legal title to Bernice when the total
price was paid. If at any time Bernice
defaulted on her payments, Sarah
could cancel the agreement, retain all
moneys paid, and retake possession.
This land security device is most prop-
erly described as:

A. A deed of trust.

B. An installment land contract.

C. A mortgage.

D. A present transfer of a leasehold
coupled with a future interest
in fee simple absolute when
Bernice pays the full purchase
price.

who took a mortgage from him in
return for lending him the money for
the purchase price. Ellen transferred
her interest in the mortgage to Frank.
The Ellen-to-Frank agreement was
silent as to whether Frank assumed the
mortgage along with Ellen's interest in
it. After the Ellen-Frank transfer, the
mortgagee's rights and responsibilities
lie with:

A. Ellen. If a transfer is silent, it is
presumed to be taken "subject
to" the mortgage.

B. Frank. If a transfer is silent, the
transferee is presumed to be "as-

gave him a 30 year mortgage as se-
curity for the purchase price. Fifteen
years later, Lyle sold Goldacre to
Lilly, who assumed the mortgage. As
a result of the transfer, Jerrold agreed
to release Kyle from the debt since
the property was worth more than
the outstanding mortgage. However,
property values fell and the mortgage
exceeded the value of the land. Lilly
defaulted and Goldacre was sold at a

107. In 1960, Marcy and Bob owned Sil-
veracre, which they mortgaged to
Adam for 30 years in order to borrow
$150,000 from him. In 1970, Marcy
and Bob sold Silveracre to Della for
$200,000. Della did not agree to as-
sume the mortgage and she moved
onto the property. In 1980, Marcy and
Bob defaulted on the mortgage. Adam
now wishes to sell the property at a
judicial sale without Della's consent.
May he do so?

A. Yes. Della took the property sub-
ject to the mortgage and cannot
prevent the sale, even though she
is not liable on the debt.

B. No. Della took the property
subject to the mortgage and she
is not liable on the debt. The
property cannot be foreclosed
upon without her consent.

C. Yes. Marcy and Bob did not
pay Adam in 1970 when they
received $200,000 from Della.
Della should have insisted that
they do so and, therefore, is not
a BFP.

D. No. Della paid $200,000 to the
original mortgagor, more money
than the outstanding debt, there-
fore, she has been equitably
discharged from the mortgage.

109. In 1970, Rhetta mortgaged Redacre
to Tom for $100,000. In 1980, Rhetta
borrowed $45,000 from Sally and
gave another mortgage on Redacre.
Sally was aware of Tom's mortgage.
In 1985, Rhetta defaulted on Tom's
loan on which there was an outstand-

defaulted on her loan from Sally ow-
ing $40,000. After giving notice to all
relevant parties, Tom foreclosed and
had the property sold at a judicial sale
for $90,000 after court costs, etc. The
proper distribution of the foreclosure
proceeds is:

A. $60,000 to Tom (2/3 of $90,000),
$30,000 to Sally (1/3 of $90,000)
— since Tom is owed twice as
much as Sally by Rhetta.

B. $60,000 to Tom (75% of
$80,000), $30,000 to Sally (75%
of 40,000) — since $90,000
is 75% of $120,000 the total
amount owed.

C. $50,000 to Tom, $40,000 to Sally

acre. Wilma was aware of Vern's
mortgage. In 1990, Ursala defaulted on
her loan to Vern, owing him $80,000.
She did not default on her loan to

junior claimant and there is no
money left from the sale.

B. Are extinguished, but only if
the buyer at the foreclosure sale

to Maria for $250,000. That mortgage
was recorded. In 1975, Loni borrowed
$175,000 from Nash and gave Nash
a mortgage on Wheatacre. Nash re-
corded his mortgage. In 1980, Loni

to force a judicial foreclosure sale of
Wheatacre out from under Otto, he
will:

A. Prevail, but only if Otto had
actual knowledge of Nash's
mortgage.

B. Not prevail, once a senior interest
forecloses at a judicial sale, all
unpaid junior claims are extin-
guished.

C. Prevail, but only because she
was not given notice or joined
in Maria's foreclosure sale.

BFP who purchased at a judicial
sale without Nash present and
without notice of Nash's inter-
est.

END OF QUESTIONS

PROPERTY ANSWERS

1. C is the correct answer. The deed states
that it is "subject to the understanding
that...", which states a contractual obli-
gation and not a limitation on the estate
granted. Either a fee simple determin-
able, B, or by a fee subject to condition
subsequent, D, limits the estate. More-
over, A is incorrect because although
an equitable charge or servitude is
enforceable in equity, it too needs to be
created with words of limitation on the
use of the property.

2. C is the correct answer and is really
the only correct statement of law. A
is incorrect because a co-tenant may
assign his share of the leasehold bar-
ring other contractual provisions. B is
incorrect because a "no assignment"
clause grants rights to the landlord, but
not to the co-tenant as co-signatory. D
is incorrect because although restraints
on alienation are disfavored, they are
sometimes upheld when public policy
dictates, and "no assignment" clauses
are examples of this policy choice.

3. B is the correct answer. The Rule
Against Perpetuities is not violated.
Since this is a will, at Oscar's death
we will know who all of his surviving
children are regardless of age. Using
those children as measuring lives, we
must know, at each child's life, whether
or not that child attained age 30. Thus,
A, C and D are incorrect.

4. D is the correct answer. This problem
depends on whether the jurisdiction
requires that a title searcher look in
the entire grantor-grantee index for all
conveyances made by a grantor, even
those beyond the years the record shows
title in that person. If so, then the wild
deed from Mary to Nancy will be within
Orene's chain of title and she is bound
by constructive notice of it. Thus, es-
toppel by deed. C will not apply under
that type of recording scheme and C is
incorrect, as well as A and B.

5. D is the correct answer. The question
asks for legal title to the fodder area
(land). Therefore, since the document of
which A speaks is inadequate to transfer
title to land, A cannot be correct. B is
also wrong since title to the land is not
an incident to the easement or profit
to cut fodder which are rights to use
property. Similarly, C is also incorrect
for the same reason as B. Thus, D is the
only answer which correctly speaks of
title to land.

6. A is the correct answer. Xavier had been
in adverse possession of Purpleacres
under color of title for 14 years when
the statute of limitations is 10 years.
Title is in him from that point forward.
All subsequent events (i.e. the lease, the
transfer of rights to Yves, and the deed
to Norris are irrelevant to this problem.)
B, C and D are therefore incorrect. 

PROPERTY 441

10. B is the correct answer. A covenant runs
with the land to bind successive owners
of the property regardless of their use
of the facilities. An easement, A grants
the right to use someone's property,
and does not pertain to the payment
of money. Both a mortgage, C, and a
personal obligation, D, are personal to
the signatory of the promise and do not
automatically pass to successor own-
ers.

11. C is the correct answer. The courts
are reluctant to recognize affirmative
obligations to pay money indefinitely
per covenants. A and B are incorrect
statements of law. D, while potentially
correct as a matter of constitutional
law, does not necessarily mean that
the provisions would in fact violate
the Constitution; in fact, they probably
would not. 

7. B is the correct answer. Delivery of the
deed requires acceptance by the grantee.
Here, Darla was unaware of the deed
when made and when she became aware
of the deed's existence, she did not ac-
cept it. A is incorrect because even if a
grantee was unaware of the deed at the
time of recording, the grantee's subse-
quent actions at the time of learning of
the existence of the deed may constitute
valid delivery. C and D are incorrect
statements of law.

8. C is the correct answer. The right to
remove timber is incident to a fee and
Ben has a defeasible fee. Carl does have
a future interest in Silveracres, so A is
wrong. Bad faith is irrelevant to the
right to take timber — ownership, and
not possession, is the relevant factor;
thus, D and C are incorrect.

9. B is the correct answer. The Statute of
Frauds requires a writing to transfer
real property, so despite the fact that
John and Joan orally agreed to a right
of survivorship, Joan died as a tenant in
common with John. Thus, the property
goes to their heirs equally. A states a
correct result for the wrong reason. C
and D are wrong because the Statute of
Frauds controls the result.

442 PROPERTY

12. C is the correct answer. The life ten-
ant is responsible for payment of the
mortgage principal during that estate
in this instance. Although the general
rule is that the life tenant is responsible
for the interest and the remainderman
is responsible for the principal, in this
fact pattern the mortgage is for 10
years. Thus, the mortgage should be
completely satisfied within the life
tenant's estate and Amanda should be
responsible for the principal as well.
However, the remainderman is respon-
sible for any remaining portion and may
have his future interest affected if the
life tenant does not pay. A and B are
therefore incorrect. Bailey could try
to compel partition, D, but it is not his
only protection as the answer states;
therefore, it is wrong.

13. D is the correct answer. Otto entered
into a lease with Beatrice, even if it was
rent-free. The subsequent conveyance
to Aaron only gave Aaron rights in the
property if he obtained a role in a Hol-
lywood movie by age 35, something
he had not done. Thus, Otto is still
the landlord of Beatrice. A is incorrect
because the key to the question lies in
recognizing the fact that Aaron's inter-
est was a future interest. B is wrong as
a matter of law. C is the right result for
the wrong reason.

14. D is the correct answer since it is the
only answer that makes sense. Retalia-
tory eviction would prevent a landlord
from raising rent in response to the as-
sertion of a tenant's legal rights. C states
a rule of law which does not exist and
B may or may not be true depending on
what, if anything, this jurisdiction's law
on unconscionability states. Although
the payment of monthly rental may in
some circumstances imply a periodic
tenancy, that does not directly affect the
amount of rent due under that tenancy;
therefore A is incorrect.

15. D is the correct answer. The answer
depends on the type of tenancy created.
B and C state absolutely what the own-
ership of Indigoacres is; however, the
question does not make that clear. Thus,
there are situations in which B and C
might be wrong. D is the only answer
which states the conditions under which
it will be true, and those conditions
make the answer true under all readings
of the facts in the question. Therefore,
D is correct. A is wrong; constructive
knowledge is irrelevant.

16. C is the correct answer. Agnes began us-
ing the property with 011ie's permission
and, therefore, no easement by prescrip-
tion could be gained. Since Paul never
gained title to the property, his posses-
sion cannot affect Agnes since he was
never the owner of the property. Thus,
answers A, B and D, which all depend
on Paul's involvement in the problem
in some way, are incorrect. 

PROPERTY 443

20. A is the correct answer. The restrictive
covenant in the deed from Oliver Wen-
dell to Beth runs with the land to Della
even if the deed from Beth to Della did
not physically contain that covenant.
Thus, D and C are both incorrect.
Whether or not the apartment building
value is irrelevant ro me answer ro  11115
question. Therefore, B is incorrect.

21. C is the correct answer. D is an incorrect
statement of law: Equitable servitudes
do not require privity with the original
covenanting parties. A is a nonsense
answer. It may sound good, but means
nothing and is not even correct as a
statement of constitutional law. Al-
though B is true as an abstract statement
of principle, it has little to do with this
question which specifically depends on
whether Abby can say that it was origi-
nally contemplated that Oliver Wendell
intended to develop the 20-acre parcel
in the same manner as the 40 lots. Thus,
C is the best choice. 

17. A is the correct answer. B is not a cor-
rect statement of law. The joint tenancy
cannot be severed by an oral agree-
ment. Whatever fiduciary obligations,
if any, Betty had by being named as
executrix of Alice's estate cannot affect
title to land; C is incorrect. D is also
the Statute or Frauds tor ciose family
relationships. Thus, although A is not
obviously always correct, it is the only
likely possibility.

18. B is the correct answer. The Statute of
Frauds demands a writing not present
in this problem. Neither A nor C are
correct since a joint tenancy can be sev-
ered unilaterally by one tenant through
a valid conveyance which need not be
recorded. D, while true, does not have
much to do with whether Alice severed
the joint tenancy during her lifetime
— which is what the problem is about.

19. A is the correct answer. The question
asks for Baker's best argument for
immediate possession; therefore, C is
wrong since a month-to-month tenant
would need to give 30 days notice,
which Baker did not provide. Since
Selwyn was, in fact, once lawfully in
possession, he could not be a trespasser,
answer D. Only calling Selwyn a licens-
ee, A gives Baker the automatic right to
terminate Selwyn's use of the property
immediately and unequivocally. Calling
him a tenant at sufferance, B provides
Baker with the option of ejectment, but
still requires termination of the tenancy
by Baker.

444 PROPERTY

22. D is the correct answer. The question
asks for the probable outcome of the
litigation. The school has breached the
condition on the land and, thus, dam-
ages and an injunction are proper. B
and C are, therefore, incorrect. The real
choice is between A and D. The problem
with A is that it is not as specific as D
as to the outcome of the suit. D states
that damages need to be impounded,
presumably to await the determination
of who Juan's grandchildren will be at
the time of Juanita's death. This answer
is more accurate than A because it is
more complete.

23. B is the correct answer. C is not correct,
as a matter of law, because recording
cannot insulate an invalid deed. D calls
upon a general equitable principle that
the most innocent person not bear the
loss, but that principle cannot control
over a legal reason like agency. Simi-
larly, A states a general public policy
for certainty in land records, but that
policy also cannot control over a legal
reason like agency. Therefore, B is cor-
rect since, if true in this situation, Maria
will lose the suit.

24. C is the correct answer. The Rule
Against Perpetuities is not violated
and so B is wrong. Using Dolly as the
measuring life, we must know who her
surviving children are within 21 years
of her death. Only the restrictions on
mortgage or sale are invalid as restraints
on alienation. Thus, A and D are incor-
rect.

25. D is the correct answer. A tenancy by
the entirety absolutely requires a grant
to a validly married couple. The con-
veyance granted a tenancy which can
be partitioned by the petition of one of
the tenants. B and C are incorrect state-
ments of law. Although A is true in the
abstract, it is not true on these facts.

26. B is the correct answer. At the end of
Fred's life estate, the gift to his children
takes immediate effect. It is, therefore,
a remainder and not an executory inter-
est, answer A. It vests now, but will be
divested "provided that...."; thus, it is
vested subject to divestment, answer
B, and is not contingent, answer D, nor
indefeasibly vested, answer C.

27. B is the correct answer. At the time
the land sale contract was executed,
equitable conversion applies and the
purchase price is treated as the personal
property of the seller, and title to the
land is treated as real property of the
buyer. Therefore, when Bernie died, the
proceeds of the sale were his personal
property and pass to Peter. A is, thus,
incorrect because B is correct. C and
D are incorrect statements of law.

PROPERTY 445

31. D is the correct answer. A is incorrect
because a landowner has an absolute
right to lateral support for unimproved
land. B is incorrect because even if
the weight of the barn contributed to
the damage, he may still recover if he
can prove that Ethel was negligent in
her excavation. C is incorrect, for the
reasons given for A and B, even if she
is negligent, Fred has an absolute right
to lateral support for unimproved land.
Therefore, D correctly states the full
legal principle.

32. B is the correct answer. The interest in
Helen's children immediately follows
the preceding life estate; thus, it is a
remainder and C is incorrect. Moreover,
since there is no child of Helen alive
at the time of the conveyance, the re-
mainder is contingent and A is incorrect.
Since the Rule Against Perpetuities is
not violated (use Helen as the measur-
ing life), D is incorrect. 

28. A is the correct answer. At the time
the land sale contract was executed,
equitable conversion applies and the
purchase price is treated as personal
property of the seller and title to the
land is treated as the real property of the
buyer. Therefore, when Carla died, the
title to the land was in her and passes
to Ricky, her heir who can demand
specific performance of the contract. B
is incorrect because A is correct. C and
D are incorrect statements of law.

29. A is the correct answer. The legal
description of land in a deed must be
precise enough to determine which
property is being conveyed. This de-
scription is insufficient. The covenant of
seisin, answer B, consideration, answer
D, and lack of facial ambiguity, answer
C, are all irrelevant.

30. D is the correct answer. Although there
is a discrepancy in acreage B, the legal
description of land given by the address
is sufficient to adequately identify the
property, especially where, as here,
the discrepancy is minor. There is no
requirement that the deed contain a
metes and bounds description, answer
A. C is incorrect because, although a
grantor cannot convey more than she
owns, the problem here is with the land
description in the deed, not the amount
of the property conveyed.

446 PROPERTY

33. D is the correct answer. An easement
created by express grant is not de-
pendent on continued necessity for its
continuation. Thus, A is incorrect. B
is incorrect since a change in circum-
stances does not necessarily terminate
an easement, and, in any event, this is
an express easement which is imposed
and perpetuated despite any diminution
in market value. C is incorrect because
this is an easement and not an incorpo-
real hereditament (which is an interest
in land incapable of being possessed
and only consisting of a right to use
something). This sewer was not only
used but possessed by the parties.

34. C is the correct answer. There is no
natural right to an easement for light, air
or view. A states otherwise and is incor-
rect. B is incorrect because Quintin was
under no obligation to inform anyone
of his plans to lawfully develop his
property and, thus, under no obligation
to "preserve" that right by complain-
ing about Susan's pool. Similarly, D is
incorrect because his right to lawfully
develop his property is not dependent
on informing his neighbors.

35. C is the correct answer. The fact that
the grantor retains possession of the
deed creates a rebuttable presumption
of an invalid delivery and there is no
evidence which would rebut that pre-
sumption here. As between the parties
to a transaction, recording of the deed
is not necessary for a deed's validity.
Therefore, B and D are incorrect. A is
incorrect because there is no conditional
delivery on these facts.

36. C is the correct answer. If Wilma rebuts
the presumption of invalidity which
arises when the deed remains in the
grantor's possession by showing that
her mother intended to part with the
property irrevocably, Victoria would
lose. A is incorrect because there is no
oral condition on these facts which is
being used to rebut delivery. B and D
are incorrect because they state prin-
ciples of law which are irrelevant to this
problem.

37. D is the correct answer. Since repay-
ment of the principal goes to protect the
future value of the remainderman's fee,
Xerxes is responsible for that amount.
The interest represents the current use
of the money borrowed and is, there-
fore, payable by the current user of the
property, Will. A, B and C are incorrect
for the same reasons that D is correct. 

PROPERTY 447

38. A is the correct answer. Zerlina's status
as a bona fide purchaser is irrelevant as
between the covenanting parties, Zer-
lina and Yvette. Therefore, for this rea-
son, D is incorrect. Yvette gave Zerlina
a warranty deed, which by definition
contains all the title covenants. There-
fore, B is inapplicable here. Moreover,
the suit for breach of title covenants is
a suit for breach by the original cov-
enantee, Zerlina, and thus, answer C is
inapplicable here, too. The suit for title
covenant breaches is dependent on the
original Yvette-Zerlina deed's original
validity.

39. A is the correct answer. If Carla and
Dan were legally married at the time
of Benjy's conveyance and remained
so when Carla conveyed to Esther,
the title was held by Carla and Dan
as tenants by the entirety, and was
inalienable by either of them without
the other spouse's consent. B is incor-
rect because if Carla and Dan were not
married during the relevant period, the
tenancy might have been a joint ten-
ancy which was severable by Carla's
intervivos conveyance. Dan would not
be the sole owner. D is incorrect for the
same reason A is the correct answer, i.e.,
Carla and Dan's possible marriage. C is
incorrect because notice is irrelevant to
this problem.

448 PROPERTY

40. B is the correct answer. The question
states that a junior claimant must be
in good faith. Therefore, he must be
without notice and a Race statute is
inapplicable. The question does not tell
us that the claimant must record first (or
at all), and so the recording act could
be either Race-Notice or Notice. A, C
and D are, therefore, incorrect.

41. C is the correct answer. Since the re-
cording act must be a Race-Notice or a
Notice statute (see answer above), Hal
must prevail if he paid value. When
Hal received his deed, Gus' deed was
not recorded (Hal wins under a Notice
statute), and when Hal recorded first, he
wins under a Race-Notice statute. The
only scenario under which Hal does
not prevail is if he is not a purchaser
and therefore cannot claim protection
under the act. A and B are inaccurate
statements of law. D is incorrect for
the same reasons that C is the correct
answer.

42. C is the correct answer. The interest
in UNICEF followed a defeasible fee
in Randy. Therefore, it could not have
been a remainder of any sort. A and
B are incorrect. The interest does not
violate the Rule Against Perpetuities
because the residential-purposes condi-
tion only applies until 1970. Therefore,
using anyone alive in 1950 as the mea-
suring life, at their death plus 21 years,
we must know whether the property has
been used for residential purposes until
1970. D is, therefore, incorrect. 

43. D is the correct answer. This is a notice
statute, giving priority to purchasers for
value who take without notice. A and B
are incorrect because a mortgagee pays
consideration (the loan proceeds) for
the interest in land received (mortgage)
and would qualify under the statute as
an "interest in land." C is incorrect,
because under a notice statute, priority
in recording is not required to prevail.

44. C is the correct answer. Since Max
did not record his deed until 1985, his
deed is outside of Pedro's chain of title
because it cannot be found under the
traditional method of searching title.
Therefore, Pedro is without notice of
Max's interest in Pineacres and entitled
to prevail under a Notice statute. A is an
erroneous statement of law. B and D are
incorrect because Pedro's rights derive
from his being without notice and are
not dependent on the equities regarding
his grantor, Oliver (who may not be able
to prevail himself in an action against
Max — see below).

45. A is the correct answer. Oliver is a donee
and not a purchaser for value. Thus, the
recording act is inapplicable to him. The
property will be awarded by common
law "first in time, first in right," to Max.
B is incorrect because the reason Max
prevails is that he was the first convey-
ance from Lana. His knowledge and
purchase price are irrelevant. C and
D are incorrect since these statements
refer to priority under the recording act
which is inapplicable to Oliver.

46. D is the correct answer. Max prevails
because of the common law rule of
"first in time, first in right." His status
as purchaser, or taker under a quitclaim
are all irrelevant. B and C are, thus, in-
correct. A is incorrect since it refers to
priority under the recording act which
is irrelevant here.

47. B is the correct answer. Covenants in
a lease against assignment or sublet-
ting are strictly construed against the
landlord. C and D are incorrect since
they state erroneous conclusions of law.
Although they are disfavored, those
lease covenants are not always invalid.
A is therefore incorrect.

48. D is the correct answer. Kelly's interest
would have been an executory inter-
est since it follows a fee — had it not
violated the Rule Against Perpetuities.
It violates the Rule since there is no
life in being such that at that person's
death, we must know whether or not the
property will cease being used for ranch
purposes. Thus, A and B are wrong even
before the application of the Rule, and
C is incorrect after the application of
the Rule.  

PROPERTY 449

49. D is the correct answer. Since the book-
cases were permanently affixed to the
realty, they are treated as fixtures. Thus,
C is incorrect. Whether or not they are
considered trade fixtures and remov-
able at the end of the lease (answer A),
or non-trade fixtures and removable
per the modern trend (answer B), the
removing tenant must remove them
without doing damage to the realty — a
requirement contradicted by the facts
here. A and B are, therefore, incorrect.

50. D is the correct answer. If common law
ameliorative waste is still the law of
this jurisdiction, a tenant cannot make
alteration to the premises — even those
which improve the property. A and B
are incorrect because, although mod-
ernly a long-term or life tenant may
be permitted to set off the value of the
improvements against any money owed
the landlord, at common law he could
not. Neither A nor B make that distinc-
tion. C is incorrect because permissive
waste (failure to make repairs) does not
apply to this situation.

51. D is the correct answer. If common law
ameliorative waste is still the law of
this jurisdiction, a tenant cannot make
alterations to the premises — even those
which improve the property. The book-
cases are an alteration to the premises.
A and B are incorrect because, although
modernly a long-term or life tenant may
be permitted to set off the value of the
improvements against any money owed
the landlord, at common law he could
not. Neither A nor B make that distinc-
tion. C is incorrect because permissive
waste (failure to make repairs), does not
apply to this situation.

52. D is the correct answer. The interest
in UNICEF violates the Rule Against
Perpetuities since there is no life in be-
ing such that at that person's death, we
must know whether the property has
ceased being used for residential pur-
poses. Therefore, the executory interest
in UNICEF fails and is replaced by a
possibility of reverter in Laura, which
is willed to Nella in 1974. Therefore,
A, B and C are all incorrect.

53. D is the correct answer. The interest
in UNICEF followed a defeasible fee
in Marcy. Therefore, it could not have
been a remainder of any sort. A and B
are thus incorrect. The interest violates
the Rule Against Perpetuities (see an-
swer above), and, thus, C is incorrect. 

450 PROPERTY

54. A is the correct answer. Zedidiah has
a written document from the owner of
Wheatacres entitling him to enter the
property and remove wheat from it.
This describes a protectable property
interest under the due process clause
of the federal Constitution (called a
profit a prendre). B and D are incorrect
since this interest is not a license. C is
incorrect because a profit is an interest
in land, the taking of which requires
compensation by the state.

55. A is the correct answer. As between he
original parties to a covenant, there is
no requirement that the covenant (bur-
den or benefit) run with the land. The
arrangement need only be in writing, as
this one is. Therefore, B, C and D are
incorrect.

56. C is the correct answer. Since this cov-
enant is sought to be enforced by Car-
ole, the grantee of the covenantee, only
the benefit side of the promise must run
with the land. If it does so, Carole may
enforce this covenant against Boris, the
original covenantor. B and D are incor-
rect for the same reasons that C is the
correct answer. A is incorrect because
the requirements for the benefit of a
covenant to run are met on these facts.

57. A is the correct answer. As between
the original parties to a covenant, there
is no requirement that the covenant
(burden or benefit) run with the land.
The arrangement need only be in writ-
ing as this one is. Similarly, there is no
requirement of horizontal privity either;
it is irrelevant to this problem that Boris
and Adam do not have an interest in the
same land at the same time (horizontal
privity). C is therefore incorrect. D is in-
correct since the difference in remedies
is relevant to whether the agreement can
be enforced as a covenant (damages)
or servitude (injunction). This promise
could be enforced as either.

58. C is the correct answer. Carole, a
grantee from the original covenantee,
Adam is seeking to enforce the cov-
enant against Della, a grantee from the
original covenantor. The burden and
benefit of the covenant must touch and
concern land. However, there is also a
requirement that the original covenant-
ing parties be in horizontal privity with
each other. Therefore, A and B are
incorrect. D is incorrect because the
validity of a covenant is not affected
solely by economic efficiency or the
zoning of adjacent properties.

59. B is the correct answer. A landowner has
the absolute right to subjacent support
for land and all buildings existing on
the date of severance of the underlying
strata. In order to recover for damage
to subsequently erected buildings, a
landowner must prove negligence.
Therefore, A, C and D are incorrect. 

PROPERTY 451

60. C is the correct answer. Ellen's son's
interest is an executory interest. There-
fore, A is incorrect since it is not vested.
The Rule Against Perpetuities applies
to all executory interests, and, thus, B
is incorrect. However, the Rule is not
violated since using Ellen as the mea-
suring life, one must know at her death
plus 21 years whether or not she has a
son. D is, therefore, incorrect.

61. D is the correct answer. The 1980 con-
veyance did not expressly create a joint
tenancy and thus was a tenancy in com-
mon. Therefore, when Benny died, his
1/2 interest passed to Della, who shared
the property with Carl. Consequently,
A and B are incorrect since they state
sole interests. C is incorrect because the
interest shared by Carl and Della is not
a joint tenancy.

62. B is the correct answer. A co-tenant
owes a proportionate share of taxes
and other expenses of the property.
However, since each co-tenant has the
exclusive right to possess the entire
property, Carl does not owe the fair
market rental value of the property to
Della. Therefore, since B is the only
answer to contain the correct combina-
tion of those two principles, A, C and
D are incorrect.

452 PROPERTY

63. D is the correct answer. The class gift
to the grandchildren is void under the
Rule Against Perpetuities. Presently, no
person exists as a "measuring life" such
that, at that person(s)' death, plus 21
years, you will know who all the grand-
children are. Since it is possible for
Francisco to have children born after the
date of the instrument, the class of his
children cannot be used as measuring
lives. Therefore, by the "all or nothing"
rule, since it is possible for one member
of the class (grandchildren) to vest (be
born) after the perpetuities period, the
gift to the class must completely fail,
and the interest is void. Therefore, A
is incorrect. B is incorrect because the
date of Isabella's birth, per se, is not rel-
evant. C is incorrect, because although
in a per stirpes distribution the children
of a deceased parent do step up to take
their parent's share, that principle is
irrelevant to this problem.

64. C is the correct answer. The will
originally gave Kermit a life estate, his
children a vested remainder subject to
open (one child is alive in 1960), and a
contingent remainder in Kermit's heirs.
The Rule in Shelly's case changes the
remainder in Kermit's heirs to a vested
remainder in Kermit which cannot
merge with Kermit's life estate because
of the vested interest in Kermit's chil-
dren. Therefore, A is incorrect because
it ignores the Rule in Shelly's case. B is
incorrect because it improperly applies
merger. D is incorrect for the reasons
stated above.  

65. B is the correct answer. Maxilla has hos-
tilely, openly, actually and continuously
adversely possessed Greenacre for the
statutory period of 20 years. However,
the statute of limitations for adverse
possession begins in 1983 when Larry's
disability of infancy is terminated. A
is incorrect because it ignores the fact
that Larry is disabled by his age from
bringing an action in ejectment. C is
incorrect because there is no tacking
of disabilities. D is incorrect because
of the reasons stated above.

66. C is the correct answer. The Rule in
Dumpor's case states that once the
landlord gives consent to one assign-
ment, any covenant in a lease requiring
consent is terminated. Because Laurette
already consented to the assignment
to Tina, she did not need to give her
consent to any other assignment to To-
masso. A is incorrect because although
lease covenants may be construed
against the landlord, that principle is
merely a generalized policy statement
and would not necessarily determine the
outcome of a case, like answer C. B is
a correct statement of principle, but is
inapplicable to these facts. D refers to
the Rule in Spencer's case, which states
that a covenant relating to a thing not
yet in existence must expressly bind
successors. That rule is also inappli-
cable to the facts.

67. A is the correct answer. The parking
garage was not yet in existence when
a promise was made concerning the
maintenance of the spaces. That prom-
ise did not expressly mention assigns,
and therefore does not bind successors.
B is incorrect because there is hori-
zontal privity in that Laurette and Ted
were landlord and tenant respectively.
C and D are incorrect since the benefit
and burden do touch and concern land
in that the parking spaces would be
maintained, causing a benefit to the
landlord's reversion and a detriment
through the expenditure of time/labor/
money by the tenant.

68. D is the correct answer. Tina possessed
the office space for nine months; thus,
constituting an obligation of $200 per
month under privity of estate, for that
time. Since she never signed a lease
agreement with Laurette, she is not
bound by privity of contract for any
amount of money. Thus, C is incorrect.
Since Tomasso never signed a lease, nor
moved into the building, he is bound by
neither privity of contract nor privity of
estate, respectively. Therefore, A and B
are incorrect. 

PROPERTY 453

72. B is the correct answer. The measure
of damages for a breach of one of the
title covenants, regarding title defects,
is the purchase price received by the
person making the promise (plus inter-
est). Since Owen was only an owner
of 1/2 of the interest promised in the
deed, the damages here would be 1/2
the purchase price received by Albert
($50,000/2= $25,000). A, C and D are
all incorrect figures.

73. B is the correct answer. The measure of
damages for a breach of one of the title
covenants, regarding title defects, is the
purchase price received by the person
making the promise (plus interest).
Since Owen was only an owner of 1/2
of the interest promised in the deed, the
damages here would be 1/2 the purchase
price received by Owen ($40,000/2 =
$20,000). C and D are incorrect fig-
ures. A is incorrect because although
the Albert-Bea deed was a quitclaim,
Bea can sue under the future covenants
given in the Owen-Albert deed.

74. C is the correct answer. In adverse
possession, the possessor gains the es-
tate in existence at the date she began
possession. In 1951, when Sara began
possession of Purpleacres, the estate in
existence was a life estate in Quintin.
After his death in 1966, the remainder in
Rula went into effect and a new period
of adverse possession began. That pe-
riod would be complete in 1986. Thus,
A, B and D are incorrect. 

69. B is the correct answer. In adverse
possession, a possessor does not have
to constantly live on the land for the
statutory period, but need only make
such use of the property consistent with
its nature and character, e.g., using a ski
cabin during ski season. A is incorrect
because it assumes the essential issue
to be resolved, i.e., whether intermit-
tent use is consistent with the nature of
the property. C and D state conclusions
which contradict the legal principle in
this problem.

70. B is the correct answer. The measure of
damages for a breach of the covenant of
seisin is the purchase price (plus inter-
est). Since Owen was only an owner of
1/2 of the interest promised in the deed,
the damages here would be 1/2 the pur-
chase price ($40,000/2= $20,000). A, C
and D are all incorrect figures.

71. B is the correct answer. The measure of
damages for breach of a title insurance
contract is normally the diminution in
fair market value of the land caused by
the defect. Since the value of the land
as promised was $40,000 and the value
of the land as a tenancy in common is
$15,000, the damages equal $40,000
— $15,000, i.e., = $25,000. A, C and D
are all incorrect figures.

454 PROPERTY

75. A is the correct answer. In adverse
possession, the possessor gains the es-
tate in existence at the date she began
possession. In 1949, when Sara began
possession of Purpleacres, the estate in
existence was a fee simple in Paulette.
The subsequent conveyance and divi-
cinn of thr. ■ci-atir• wac irt-FdPArant tri t1ii
session. That period was completed in
1969. B, C and D are incorrect for the
same reasons that A is correct.

76. C is the correct answer. Since Wilbur's
land is not located adjacent or beneath
the Jefferson River, it is not riparian
land. Therefore, A and B, which are
riparian theories, only permit water to
be taken for use on riparian land and
are not available for Wilbur's use. Prior
appropriation gives rights in water to
the first taker, regardless of his or her
ownership or use on riparian land. It is
the only water rights theory available
to Wilbur. D is incorrect for the same
reason that C is correct.

77. C is the correct answer. The statute of
frauds requires that contracts for the
sale of land, and also agency contracts,
be in writing. Therefore, although the
land sales contract and the Sam-Theresa
contract are in writing, the Beth-Carlos
contract was not. Thus, A and B are
incorrect. D is incorrect since there
is no requirement that the parties to a
contract personally sign the agreement.
An agent's signature is binding on the
principal.

78. C is the correct answer. A wife received
a dower interest of 1/3 in all the land in
which her husband was seised at his
death. At Harry's death, his life estate
in Violetacres ended. Thus, answers A
and B, which state Wendy has an inter-
est in that property, are incorrect. The
riPfplacihlta fPPj n Indiana•rt.c and thg. fgla
(or his heirs) after his death, and Wendy
had dower in those lands. Therefore,
answer D is incorrect.

79. D is the correct answer. A wife received
a dower interest in 1/3 in all land in
which her husband was seized at his
death. A, B and C are, therefore, incor-
rect.

80. D is the correct answer. In order to
satisfy the statute of frauds, a written
memorandum must contain the price
term. A and B are incorrect, as an es-
sential term price may never be implied
by the court in a land sales contract. C
is incorrect. Whether or not Bella intro-
duced evidence of fair market value, the
written memorandum must contain the
actual price agreed upon.

81. C is the correct answer. The 1950 con-
veyance created a fee tail in Agnes,
and, therefore, left a reversion in Lee.
A, B and D are incorrect since they
state other interests in grantors — none
of which are present here. 

PROPERTY 455

82. A is the correct answer. Since Agnes
had a fee tail, after her death the land
must transfer to her lineal descendants
or, if none, it must revert to the grantor.
Therefore, Bruno's interest must end
at Agnes' death. Moreover, since she
gave him a life estate, it must also end
at his death. Consequently, C and D are
incorrect. B is incorrect since the death
of either Agnes or Bruno immediately
ends the estate. Thus, it is the first to die,
not the last, which terminates Bruno's
estate.

83. D is the correct answer. Agnes had a
fee tail which descends to her lineal
heirs, here Carlotta, the child of Agnes.
A, B and C are all estates which may
approximate a fee tail, but are not the
estate granted to Agnes and inherited
by Carlotta.

84. C is the correct answer. After Agnes
died, her fee tail passed to her daughter,
Carlotta. Lee still retains a reversion
which will go into possession, if ever,
after Agnes' lineal heirs all die. A, B and
D are incorrect since they all state in-
terests in the grantor not present here.

85. A is the correct answer. The natural-
flow riparian rights theory gives a
downstream owner the right not to have
the flow of water diminished in either
quality or quantity from its natural state.
This is true even if the downstream
owner had sufficient water for her
needs. The reasonable-use theory only
permits injunction if the downstream
owner has insufficient water for her
needs. Since answer A is the only option
which presents the natural-flow theory
alone, it is the only correct answer.

86. C is the correct answer. A cumulative
zoning ordinance is one in which higher,
but not lower, uses are permitted. Since
single-family residential is a higher use
than multi-family residential, both those
uses are permitted in a multi-family
zone. A, B and D are incorrect since
they do not state that combination.

87. B is the correct answer. The grant in
writing of the right to enter Juan's land
and install and maintain telephone
equipment is an easement. A is incorrect
since a license only grants permission to
enter the land of another. If a license had
been granted, Juan could have forced
the telephone company to remove its
equipment by withdrawing his permis-
sion. C incorrectly applies the law, and
D misstates the law. 

456 PROPERTY

88. A is the correct answer. Juan expressly
granted the telephone company the right
to enter the land; therefore, it could
not have been granted an easement by
prescription. D is incorrect. The type
of easement granted is an easement
in gross, since the telephone company
owns no land benefited by the ease-
ment. However, C is incorrect since the
fact that the easement is in gross is not
relevant to whether that easement can
be apportioned/transferred to the cable
television company. A non-exclusive
easement is one in which the owner
of the servient estate (Juan) retains
the right to make the same use of his
land that was granted by the easement.
Therefore, the owner of a non-exclusive
easement (but not the owner of an ex-
clusive one) cannot apportion/transfer
it to another, since to do so would be in
derogation of the rights of the owner of
the property to sell another easement
to the cable company. B is, therefore,
incorrect.

89. D is the correct answer. If the agree-
ment was not in writing, it could not be
an easement. Therefore, A is incorrect.
Moreover, since Juan gave his permis-
sion for the telephone company to
install and maintain its equipment, the
company could not gain a prescriptive
easement (which is adverse to the owner
of the servient estate). C is, thus, incor-
rect. If the license were revocable, then
Juan could force the telephone com-
pany to remove its equipment. Since
the question states that Juan loses, B
cannot be the correct answer. The oral
agreement must have been a license,
which was made irrevocable through
the expenditure of money and labor by
the telephone company in installing and
maintaining its equipment. Therefore, D
is correct. 

PROPERTY 457

91. C is the correct answer. A and B state the
same interest in land — the future inter-
est in the grantor after he or she conveys
an estate on condition subsequent. That
interest must be affirmatively exercised
by the grantor before it goes into effect.
Answer C correctly states the interest
in the grantor, which automatically fol-
lows the divesting event in a determin-
able estate. Thus, C is better than A or
B. D is not possible on this set of facts,
since a reversion cannot follow a fee
(the present interest here).

92. D is the correct answer. The lease states
that it is to run for 24 months. Therefore,
it has a definite ending date, December
31, 1993, and, consequently, must be a
tenancy for years. The provision of an-
nual rent or monthly rental installments
cannot contradict the fixed term in the
lease. Periodic tenancies continue for
period-to-period because they do not
have a definite ending point. A and B
are, thus, incorrect. D states a possible
scenario in a holdover tenant situation,
which is not present in the Louisa-Tilly
agreement.

93. A is the correct answer. Modernly, the
landlord has a duty to deliver actual
possession of the leasehold to the tenant
at the beginning of the lease. C and D
state the common law rule of delivery
of the legal right to possession only,
and are accordingly incorrect. B may
be correct as a factual statement, but it
does not answer the question posed.

90. A is the correct answer. Although the
conveyance is somewhat ambiguous, it
does not state the limitation for school
purposes in such a way as to cut down
the estate granted (the length of time
that the school board is given title to
the property). Therefore, given the
courts' policy preference for the estate
that will least result in forfeitures, the
most likely result of the conveyance is
that Chad granted the school board a fee
simple absolute with a covenant that the
property would be used for school pur-
poses. In that event, in 1993, the school
may be liable in damages for breach of
the covenant, but its estate continues.
B refers to the school board's having a
fee simple on condition subsequent, fol-
lowed by a right of entry in Chad. That
answer is not as good as A, but better
than C. C refers to the school board as
an owner of a fee simple determinable,
which contains an automatic possibility
of reverter in Chad. The language of the
grant did not so specify. D is simply
wrong — economic inefficiency cannot
change the estate granted.

458 PROPERTY

94. A is the correct answer. This scenario
meets the elements for both an ease-
ment by implication/quasi easement
(common owner, quasi-easement, ap-
parent, continuous and strict necessity)
and an easement by necessity (common
grantor, strict necessity). Since there
have only been 19 years of use by Bo
against the use by his grantee, Celia, an
easement by prescription is not possible
here (such requires 20 years). There-
fore, A is the only answer which states
the correct combination; B, C and D do
not.

95. B is the correct answer. As stated above,
in the answer to #94, an easement by
necessity and an easement by implica-
tion/quasi-easement are possible here.
However, if an easement by necessity
is chosen, the easement will terminate
whenever the necessity does. That limi-
tation does not apply to the easement by
implication/quasi-easement. Here, the
necessity ends when the county puts in
the new road in 1988. Therefore, C will
not give Bo what he wants. A is incor-
rect since there could not be an ease-
ment by prescription here. D is possible,
but a license is normally revocable by
the licensor. Thus, Bo's best argument
is B.

96. A is the correct answer. Since Peter is
suing the original promisor, Minny, only
the benefit side of this covenant needs
to run with the land. All those elements
are met: Intent, the parties intended the
promise to run "forever"; Notice, the
promise was recorded; Touch and Con-
cern, the promise will raise the value
of Peter's land by limiting the uses to
be made on Minny's land; and Vertical
Privity, Peter is Nora's grantee. Thus,
B and D are incorrect. Since only the
benefit needs to run, horizontal privity
(choice C), is not required.

97. C is the correct answer. Unlike #96,
when Peter sues Otto, both the benefit
and the burden of the covenant need to
run. As stated above, the benefit does
run with the land. However, the burden
cannot since Minny and Nora did not
have an interest in the same land at the
same time that the promise was made
(horizontal privity). A is incorrect since
the covenant does not run with the land.
C and D are incorrect since there is ver-
tical privity (choice C) and the covenant
does touch and concern the land (choice
D).

PROPERTY 459

100. C is the correct answer. A tenant who
wrongfully holds over on her lease is
a tenant at sufferance until such time
as the landlord chooses to treat her as
a trespasser and evict her, or as a ten-
ant for a new term. Since Tilly legally
entered possession of Brownacres
initially, she is not a trespasser; D
is incorrect. Until Tilly pays a new
month's rent and Larry accepts that
rent, she cannot be a periodic tenant;
A is incorrect. B is also incorrect since,
unless there is an express agreement
between the landlord and the tenant
to fix the ending date of the new term
of Tilly's holdover tenancy, she cannot
be a tenant for years.

101. D is the correct answer. On default of a
deed of trust the lender/beneficiary has
the right to sell the property at either
a judicial or private sale. A mortgage
permits only a judicial sale. Therefore,
D is correct, and A, B, and C are incor-
rect. 

98. D is the correct answer. This is a suit
for specific enforcement, in equity.
Therefore, the question is whether the
promise can be enforced as an equitable
servitude. This servitude will run be-
cause the elements of intent, notice and
touch and concern (see above) are all
met. Of all the answers, only D can be
correct. A is wrong because horizontal
privity is not required for the servitude
to run. B and C are wrong since those
elements are present here. D is correct
because should notice be insufficient,
the servitude cannot run.

99. B is the correct answer. An equitable
servitude needs neither horizontal priv-
ity (choice A), nor a writing (choice C),
to run with the land. Moreover, since
there was an actual promise made in
1970 binding Minny's property, there is
no need to imply one via a negative re-
ciprocal easement, and no need to have
a common plan or scheme for develop-
ment of all lots (choice D). Therefore,
A, C and D are all incorrect. However,
since there is no other possibility of
gaining notice of this restriction through
actual notice (personal knowledge) or
constructive notice (recording), only
if the character of the property is such
that Otto should have inquired as to the
single-family restriction on Minny's
former land, would there be sufficient
notice to make the servitude run with
the land. Therefore, B is an accurate
statement.

460 PROPERTY

102. B is the correct answer. In a mortgage,
the title to the property transfers im-
mediately to the mortgagor, thus C is
incorrect. In a deed of trust, the legal
title would be vested in a third party
(trustee) by the debtor (Bernice) for
the benefit of the lender (Sarah). No
such arrangement exists here, so A is
incorrect. D is also incorrect, since
neither a present transfer of leasehold
nor a future interest in a fee simple ap-
pears contemplated. Rather, the parties
entered into a contractual arrangement
leading to transfer of title. The agree-
ment states that payments will be
made in installments with title passing
to Bernice when the full price plus
interest is paid. That arrangement is
characteristic of an installment sale.

103. A is the correct answer. The general
rule is that when property burdened
with a mortgage is sold, the property
is transferred "subject to" the mort-
gage. Therefore, Aaron is still person-
ally liable to Barry for the debt as the
original mortgagor. The transfer does
not release him from liability. There-
fore, A is correct and D is not. Carla is
not personally liable on the mortgage
unless she "assumes" the mortgage, a
fact not present here. Thus, B and C
are incorrect.

104. D is the correct answer. Ellen is the
lender/mortgagee in this transaction.
When she transfers her interest in the
mortgage to Frank, he steps into her
shoes. The phrases "subject to" or "as-
suming" a mortgage have to do with
the debtor's/mortgagor's interest. A, B
and C are incorrect.

105. C is the correct answer. When a person
takes property and assumes a mort-
gage, he or she becomes personally
liable on the debt. The original debtor
is not released from personal liability
unless there has been a novation. Thus,
A, B and D are incorrect.

106. B is the correct answer. When a person
takes property and assumes a mort-
gage, he or she becomes personally li-
able on the debt. The original debtor is
released from personal liability when
there has been a novation (release from
liability). Thus, A, C and D are incor-
rect.

107. A is the correct answer. Even though
Della did not assume the mortgage
(and is therefore, not personally li-
able on the debt), she still took land
burdened with the mortgage. Con-
sequently, if the original mortgagors
default, the land can be sold out from
under Della. B is incorrect, Della's
consent is irrelevant. The fact that
Della paid more than the amount of
the outstanding debt to the original
mortgagors is similarly irrelevant to
this question. C and D are incorrect. 

PROPERTY 461

108. C is the correct answer. On sale, the
proceeds are distributed according to
the priority of the mortgages with se-
nior interests paid before junior ones.
Any excess is given to the mortgagor.
Thus, $80,000 to Orville, $35,000 to
Paula, and $5,000 to Nancy. A, B and
D are incorrect.

109. D is the correct answer. On sale, the
proceeds are distributed according
to the priority of the mortgages with
senior interests paid before junior
ones. If there is a shortfall, the senior
claims are paid in full before the junior
who may have a right to go against the
mortgagor personally. C is incorrect. A
and B divide the proceeds among the
various claimants proportionally. That
is not correct.

110. C is the correct answer. If a junior inter-
est is not given notice at a foreclosure
sale, that interest is not extinguished.
The property is taken by the buyer
subject to the mortgage. A and B are
incorrect. However, despite no notice,
on sale, the proceeds are distributed ac-
cording to the priority of the mortgages
with senior interests paid before junior
ones. If there is a shortfall, the senior
claims are paid in full before the junior
who may have a right to go against the
mortgagor personally. D is incorrect.

462 PROPERTY

111. A is the correct answer. After a fore-
closure sale by a senior interest, any
properly noticed junior interests are
extinguished. The property can be sold
free and clear. The junior mortgagee
has a personal right to recover against
the mortgagor. Thus, B, C and D are
incorrect.

112. B is the correct answer. A foreclosure
sale by a junior interest cannot affect
the rights of a senior interest. The
property can be sold, but it is taken by
the buyer subject to the senior interest.
Thus, A and D are incorrect. The buyer
is under no obligation to pay that debt
of the original mortgagor. Thus, C is
incorrect.

113. C is the correct answer. A foreclosure
sale by a junior interest cannot affect
the rights of a senior interest. The
property can be sold, but it is taken by
the buyer subject to the senior interest.
Therefore, the proceeds are paid to the
junior claimant who foreclosed, with
the balance given to the mortgagor.
The senior's interests are still secured
by the mortgage on the property and
the personal debt of the mortgagor.
Thus, A, B and D are incorrect.

114. A is the correct answer. If a mortgage is
a recordable interest in land and if it is
not duly recorded, it is void as against a
subsequent BFP. Answers, B, C and D
assume that Gus's mortgage survives
as against Howard. It does not. They
are incorrect. 

115. B is the correct answer. If a mortgage
is not a recordable interest in land then
priority cannot be determined by the
recording act, but by the common law
rule of first in time, first in right. Kurt
takes the land, subject to Mel's interest.
A is incorrect. C and D are incorrect
since the covenants of seisin or war-
ranty concern defects in title, and a
mortgage is an encumbrance/lien.

116. B is the correct answer. A mortgage is,
in most states, considered to be a lien,
not affecting title to property. Since
the covenant of quiet use and enjoy-
ment is a future covenant, it required
a dispossession before breach. That
has not occurred on these facts. A is
incorrect. C and D are incorrect since
the covenants of seisin or warranty
concern defects in title, and a mortgage
is an encumbrance/lien.

117. C is the correct answer. Recording,
or lack of it is only used to determine
priority among claimants to the same
property. As between the transacting
parties it is not relevant. A and D are
incorrect. Since Ruby assumed the
mortgage, she agreed to be personally
bound by the debt. Pete is not released
from liability by her assumption. Thus,
B is incorrect.

118. D is the correct answer. Umberto's
mortgage, although recorded, will not
be found by a proper search of the
records because the Samantha-Ted
mortgage was not recorded. Thus,
between Umberto and Velma, Velma
has priority. C is incorrect because he
needed to be within the chain of title to
claim recording act priority. A is incor-
rect, because, although he is the senior
interest, he lost his seniority because
of Ted's non-recordation. B is the right
conclusion, for the wrong reason.

119. B is the correct answer. This is an af-
ter-acquired title problem/estoppel by
deed issue. Since the Al-Betty deed is
wild, Chuck, as a BFP, should be the
person with first priority in Peachacre.
Therefore, title is in Betty, subject to
Chuck's mortgage. Therefore, B is cor-
rect and A is not. As between Al and
Betty, Betty should prevail, therefore,
title cannot go to Al. C and D are incor-
rect.

120. D is the correct answer. Although
Felicia is the junior mortgagee, she is
the only one to record. Recording then
determines priority, not the common
law first in time, first in right. Under a
race statute, she is the first to record.
Under a race-notice statute, she is the
first to record without notice. Under a
notice statute she is the last person to
take without notice. Therefore, A, B,
and C are incomplete/incorrect. 

PROPERTY 463

121. B is the correct answer. The majority
rule is that the grant of a mortgage
by one joint tenant does not sever the
joint tenancy, it merely places a lien
on it to the extent of the joint tenant's
share. Therefore, when Gwen died, her
undivided 1/2 passed to Hilda by right
of survivorship — subject to Jeremy's
mortgage. A is incorrect. Gwen's inter-
est could not pass to Kelly. C and D
are incorrect.

122. D is the correct answer. In a title theory
state, the conveyance of a mortgage af-
fects title and severs the joint tenancy.
Therefore, when Lance sells his share,
it is severed; when Mike mortgages
his share, it is severed; and when Nor-
ris dies, he has a tenancy in common
share, so it passes to Quigley. A, B and
C are incorrect.

123. A is the correct answer. The facts do
not state which concurrent estate Re-
nee and Sal have. The law modernly
presumes that a tenancy in common
was created. Therefore, Renee can
mortgage her interest and on her death
it goes to her heirs subject to the mort-
gage. B, C and D are incorrect.

124. A is the correct answer. If a junior inter-
est is not given notice at a foreclosure
sale, that interest is not extinguished.
The property is taken by the buyer
subject to the deed of trust. B and D are
incorrect. However, despite no notice,
on sale, the proceeds are distributed ac-
cording to the priority of the deeds of
trust with senior interests paid before
junior ones. If there is a shortfall, the
senior claims are paid in full before
the junior who may have a right to
go against the trustor personally. C is
incorrect.

125. C is the correct answer. If a junior inter-
est is not given notice at a foreclosure
sale, that interest is not extinguished.
The property is taken by the buyer
subject to the mortgage. B is incor-
rect. Although Otto may not have had
actual notice of Nash's mortgage, he
had constructive notice via the record-
ing act. A and D are incorrect.

QUESTIONS

Questions I â€” 6 are based on the
following facts:

Art Kittect was a very successful designer
and builder of custom-made homes in South-
ern California. After lengthy discussions
with Bob and numerous revisions of the
plans, Art agreed to build a home for Bob.
Art and Bob signed a contract providing that
Bob's duty to pay would not arise unless the
home was constructed according to the con-
struction plans, except to the extent of con-
struction changes approved in writing.

1. Assume that Art began construction of
the home but determined that there was
a shortage of roofing tile because of
recent large-scale efforts to rebuild
many local homes destroyed in seasonal
fires. When contacted on the telephone,
Bob agreed with Art to the construction
of a "shake" roof because of the tile
shortage. After a week, Bob decided
that his "dream home" must be com-
pleted as he originally planned and told
Art he wanted the tile roof. Art refused
because he knew the tiles would be dif-
ficult to obtain, although he had not pur-
chased the shake roof materials. If Bob
brings an action against Art for breach
of contract, the court will most likely
find for:

A. Art, because Bob waived his
rights to have the tile roof in-
stalled.

B. Art, because Bob agreed to

modify the contract.   

C. Bob, because of Art's pre-exist-
ing duty to use the roofing tiles.

D. Bob, because the modification
must be expressly agreed upon.

2. Assume that while Art was construct-
ing Bob's home, the IRS notified Art
of its intent to audit him. When Bob, a
tax accountant, heard Art grumbling to
himself about the upcoming audit, Bob
volunteered to meet with the IRS to re-
solve Art's problem. Fearing the worse,
Art was ecstatic to learn that Bob was
able to reach a favorable resolution on
his behalf. Knowing that Bob had
wanted an automatic garage door
opener, but did not include one within
the plans because of financial reasons,
Art stated to Bob, "The Genie door
raiser we talked about is yours. I'll pull
one off another job and install it on
Monday." On Monday, Art's generos-
ity fizzles and he refuses to supply the
door opener. Bob sues. The court will
find for:

A. Art, since Bob's gratuitous ser-
vices were insufficient consider-
ation for Art's promise.

B. Art, since the parole evidence
rule bars oral testimony of Art's
promIse.

C. Bob, since Art's statement con 
stituted an enforceable moral
obligation.

D. Bob, since the doctrine of prom 
issory estoppel is a substitute for
Bob's otherwise gratuitous ser 
vices.

3. Assume that the contract provides for
the installation of an automatic garage
door opener, but does not mention the
type of door opener to be used. Art has
installed a 1/2 horsepower motor for the
door opener. Garage doors of similar
size and type to Bob's reasonably re 
quire a 1 horsepower motor. Bob has
noticed the 1/2 horsepower motor and
states, "You'll never get paid." If Art
files a lawsuit to obtain payment, Art
will recover:

D. Full price, but less any damages
for Art's breach of the implied
duty to install a motor with the
reasonably required amount of
power.

4. Assume for this question, that Art has
agreed to complete Bob's home by Au 
gust 1. On July 15, when construction
of Bob's home is about 80% complete,
the home is accidentally destroyed by
fire, without fault of either Art or Bob.
Art seeks to recover for the work pre 
viously performed. Will Art prevail?

A. Yes, for the reasonable value of
his services less cost of comple 
tion of the home.

B Yes, for 80% of the contract price

less Bob's damages.

C. No, because no benefit was con 
ferred upon Bob because of the
destruction of the home.

A. Full price, because he substan 
tially performed the contract.

D. No, if Art cannot complete the

home by August 1.

B. Full price, because neither the
contract nor plans specified the
type of motor to be used.

C. Nothing, because there was no
meeting of the minds due to the
failure ofArt and Bob to set forth
each material term in the written
contract.

5. Assume for this question, that the con 
tract between Art and Bob provided that
Bob would pay Art only upon receipt
of an "architect's certificate," which
certifies that the house was built in ac 
cordance with the Architect's Code of
Standards. Bob hired Conrad, a highly
reputable architect, to inspect the house
and to issue the certification. Conrad
inspected the home, but refuses to is 
sue the certification because the house
was not constructed in a workmanlike
manner pursuant to the Standards. Bob
refuses to pay the contract price. If Art
brings suit against Bob for the contract
price, the court will most likely find for:

A. Art, if Conrad has made a gross

mistake in his decision.

B. Art, unless Bob proves the home
was not constructed in a work 
manlike manner.

C. Bob, because both Art and Bob
agreed to the condition that per 
formance must be to the satisfac 
tion of a third person.

D. Bob, unless Art can prove an 
other architect would have issued
an architect's certificate.

6. Assume that Art assigned his rights
under the Art/Bob contract to Univer 
sity for the outstanding college tuition
bills of Art's daughter, Gloria. Univer 
sity notifies Bob of the assignment, but
Art only completes 50% of the home
before deciding to obtain a Bachelor's
Degree in Business Administration, at
College. College caters to older students
seeking to change careers. Art refuses
to complete the home. What result if
University files an action against Bob
to recover the contract price?

A. Bob will prevail, because the

contract is not assignable.

B. Bob will prevail, but only be 
cause Art did not complete the
job.

C. University will prevail, but will
only receive the reasonable value
of the services performed, less
damages caused by Art's failure
to complete the home.

D. University will prevail, but only
the contract price, less the cost
of completion of the contract.

C. No, because Florence did not
threaten or force Milton into con 
finement.

D. No, because Milton was unaware

of his confinement.

7. Milton was taking a weekend retreat to
his cabin in the local mountains during
the week before Christmas. He had ne 
glected to bring along snow chains,
even though there was the possibility
of snow and ice on the roadway. Al 
though Milton was driving slowly
through the icy areas, he lost control of
his car and crashed, making his car in 
operable. Milton fractured his arm in
the accident, but was able to walk back
to a small cabin IO miles from where
he had crashed.

Florence, a retired nurse, lived at the
cabin and was able to provide medical
treatment to mend Milton's arm. Flo 
rence was also starved for companion 
ship and decided to keep Milton from
leaving by locking the door to the room
where she had placed him. Exhausted
from his injuries and the lO-mile walk,
Milton had fallen fast asleep before Flo 
rence had locked him in the room. Af 
ter a night's sleep, Florence realized
what she was doing was wrong and
unlocked the door. When Milton later
awoke, he asked Florence to telephone
a relative for transportation home, and
Florence complied. Is Florence liable
to Milton for false imprisonment?

A. Yes, because Milton was actually
confined with no reasonable
means of escape.

B. Yes, because Florence intended
to confine Milton within the
room.

Questions 8 - 9 are based on the
following facts:

Robin and Mark were married last week and
set off for a honeymoon in Florida. The state
of Florida has been having a serious prob 
lem with people being robbed in front of
automatic teller machines. Florida has just
imposed a statute to protect their citizens and
tourists. The statute makes it a law that ev 
ery facility where people may obtain money
from an automatic teller machine, must have
a security guard posted during the period the
machine is operative, or in the alternative a
4' x 4' sign must be posted at the facility
warning the consumer of the potential risk
of robbery.

Despite the new law, Bank de Monies
("Bank") did not provide a security guard,
nor did they post a sign at its automatic teller.
On her first evening in Florida, Robin wasn't
feeling very well and decided to stay in the
room to get some extra rest. Mark decided
to go to Disney World and play the arcade
games. Mark made a stop at Bank to with 
draw some money from the automatic teller.
Several hours later, Robin was awakened by
a police officer. She learned that her hus 
band, Mark, was robbed and killed at the
automatic teller machine at Bank. Robin
brings a wrongful death action against Bank.

8. Bank is most likely to prevail under
which of the following theories?

A. The failure to comply with the
statute was not the actual cause
of Mark's death.

B. None of Bank's customers had
ever been killed before at any of
its automatic teller machines.

C. Mark was negligent for using an
automatic teller in an unfamiliar
city.

D. The statute is an ex post facto

law.

9. Assume for this question, that Robin,
upon hearing of her husband's death,
goes into severe emotional distress, re 
quiring a two-week hospitalization be 
fore she recovered. If Robin brings an
action against Bank de Monies based
upon the theory of negligent infliction
of emotional distress, Robin will:

A. Prevail, because Bank de Mon 
ies violated the state statute.

B. Prevail, but only because she
suffered emotional distress.

C. Not prevail, because Robin was
not present at the scene when
Mark was killed.

D. Not prevail, because Robin was
not a foreseeable plaintiff.

Questions 10 -12 are based on the
following facts:

Siegfried "convinces" Max to rob Savings
R Us Bank by handcuffing a locked brief 
case to Max's wrist, telling him it is full of
plastic explosives that will be detonated by
a remote control unit in Siegfried's posses 
sion if Max fails to follow Siegfried's re 
quest. Unknown to Max, the briefcase is
actually full of Play Doh. Max obtains
$100,000.00. from Savings R Us after threat 
ening the bank teller with a loaded gun.
State's penal code makes it a crime to "ob 
tain bank funds by use of a weapon or threat
of injury." Max was arrested before he could
flee the bank.

10. State prosecutor Buck charges Max and
Siegfried with conspiracy to violate the
penal code section. Max and Siegfried
will most likely be found:

II. Max is charged with violating the pe-
nal code section. Is it likely he will be
convicted?

A. Yes, because there is no defense
of duress since there was only
Play Doh in the briefcase.

B. No, because he robbed the bank
under the duress of Siegfried's
threats.

C. Yes, because he threatened the
bank teller with injury if the
money was not given to him.

D. No, because he never intended to

keep the money.

12. Can Siegfried be convicted of the pe-
nal code section even though Max is
acquitted?

A. Guilty, because the general rule
is that withdrawal is not a de 
fense to the crime of conspiracy.

B. Guilty, because Max failed to
thwart the completion of the
cnme.

A. No, because only the party per-
forming the prohibited act may
be convicted under the penal
code section given.

B. No, because Max did not suc-
cessfully complete the crime.

C. Not guilty, because Max was an
unwilling participant to the
crime.

C. Yes, because all parties to a con-
spiracy will be found guilty of
the underlying crime.

D. Not guilty, because Siegfried
never agreed to the details of
Max's plan to carry out the
crime.

D. Yes, because Siegfried can com-

13. Gloria, the buyer for Lost Adolescence
("Lost"), a retailer of sophisticated adult
toys, faxes an order to CompuPlay, the
nation's leading manufacturer of video
games. Gloria requests prompt ship 
ment of 5,000 of CompuPlay's most
popular game, "Res Gestae," which pits
an escaped convict (the player) against
a crack police force (the game), award 
ing points to the convict for each suc 
cessive crime committed while continu 
ing to elude capture by the police.

CompuPlay tenders the 5,000 games to
Lost one week later, payment in full due
in 30 days. Unknown to Lost, Compu 
Play's programmer had secretly repro 
grammed Res Gestae to be "politically
correct" by always having the convict
immediately captured at the beginning
of the game. This change was not ap 
parent without actually playing the
game. When Gloria tested one of the
games the day after delivery, the change
was discovered. She immediately con 
tacted CompuPlay to return the video
games, but CompuPlay refused. Who
will prevail if Lost sues CompuPlay for
breach of contract?

A. Lost, because CompuPlay ac 
cepted Gloria's offer to buy when
it shipped the non-conforming
games.

B. Lost, because it has the option of
either accepting or rejecting the
non-conforming goods.

C. CompuPlay, because it had the
option of shipping non-conform 
ing goods as an accommodation
to Lost.

D. CompuPlay, because Lost failed
to inspect the goods at time of

14. Phil owned a home on 5 acres of land,
in an oil rich region of his home state.
Continental Petroleum ("Continental")
owned and operated a pipeline deliver

passed across Phil's property. Continen 
tal is the state's largest employer. After
two years of operation, the pipeline
cracked, with oil from the pipeline
flooding Phil's property with a black
gooey mess. This did not present any
danger to Phil, but caused substantial
damage to his property. If Phil brings
an action against Continental, under
what theory will he most likely prevail?

A. Strict liability, because the opera 
tion of a pipeline is an inherently
dangerous activity.

B. Strict liability in tort, if the pipe 

line was defective.

C. Nuisance, because Phil's use and
enjoyment of his property was
interfered with.

D. Negligence, if the pipeline was

amusement park's parking lot, which is
on the east side of his property. The
amusement park offers a tram service
to shuttle people to and from the park.
However, people still walk across
Buck's property, and to prevent the tres 
passing, Buck installs an electrical
fence around his ranch. When the fence
is touched, a mild shock is given. Billy,

tram. While the tram was traveling from
the parking lot to the amusement park
facility, Billy's hat blew off and landed
against Buck's fence. Billy hopped off
the tram to retrieve it. When Billy
reached for his hat, he received a shock.
Although the shock would not ordi

Questions 19 - 23 are based on the
following facts:

Bugs, the owner of Roach Coach, a mobile
catering van, entered into a contract with
Bart, the owner of Fresh Foods. Bugs and
Bart signed a written contract on December
28. The contract provided that Roach Coach
would purchase all their sandwich require 
ments from Fresh Foods for the following
calendar year. The contract further provided
that no specific purchase quantity was re 
quired, but only the daily requirements
needed by Roach Coach at a fixed price of
$20.00 per dozen, cash on delivery. During
the first year, Fresh Foods had supplied
Roach Coach with approximately seven
dozen sandwiches per week.

19. On January 15 of the second year, Fresh
Foods was notified of a rise in cost in
production. Bart decided not to supply
Roach Coach with any more sand 
wiches. Roach Coach brings a breach
of contract action against Fresh Foods.
If Fresh Foods argues that the contract
is not binding because it lacks consid 
eration, the court will find for:

D. Roach Coach, because Roach
Coach's agreement to buy all the
sandwiches that they required,
and Fresh Foods' agreement to
supply the same quantity, is suf 
ficient consideration.

20. Assume for this question, that on Janu 
ary 30 of the second year, Bugs pur 
chased two new mobile catering vans.
This caused Roach Coach's sandwich
requirements to escalate to 20 dozen
sandwiches per week. Fresh has refused
to supply Roach Coach with any more
than seven dozen sandwiches per week.
Roach Coach brings a breach of con 
tract action against Fresh Foods. The
court will find for:

A. Fresh Foods, if the normal re 
quirements of the original con 
tract are seven dozen sandwiches
a week.

B. Fresh Foods, because Bug's in 
crease in his requirements was
not contemplated by the parties
at the time of contracting.

A. Fresh Foods, because all con 
tracts must be supported by con 
sideration

C. Roach Coach, because a valid
requirements contract was
formed.

D. Roach Coach, because the pur 
chase of the two mobile catering
vans is a normal expansion.

B. Fresh Foods, because the con

21. Assume for this question, that in April,
upon doing his taxes, Bugs realized that
he was only netting $12,000.00 a year.
This was primarily because he was only
making a $.10 profit per sandwich.
Bugs decided that the contract price for
the sandwiches was too high and noti 
fied Bart, asking if Bart would lower
the price to $17.00 a dozen. Bart re 
fused. Bugs then decided to sell hot
food only and stop selling sandwiches
altogether. Fresh Foods brings a breach
of contract action against Roach Coach.
The court will find for:

A. Fresh Foods, because Bugs' ac 
tion of not selling sandwiches
was not in good faith.

B. Fresh Foods, because under the
contract an agreement of seven
dozen sandwiches a week was
formed.

C. Roach Coach, because Fresh
Foods refused to lower the price
to $17.00 a dozen when asked.

D. Roach Coach, because a buyer,
under a requirements contract,
can eliminate his requirements
for any reason.

22. Assume that Bugs sells his Roach
Coach business to Ken and, as part of
the sale, assigns all his rights and del 
egates his duties under the Roach
Coach/Fresh Foods agreement to Ken.
Fresh Foods is notified of the sale and
assignment. Fresh Foods refuses to sup 
ply Ken with any sandwiches. If Ken
brings an action against Fresh Foods
seeking to be supplied with sandwiches,
what result?

A. Ken will be able to enforce the
Roach Coach/Fresh Food agree 
ment.

B. Fresh Foods must supply Ken's
requirements in an amount not
unreasonably disproportionate to
Bugs' requirements prior to the
business sale.

C. Fresh Foods has no obligation to
supply Ken with sandwiches.

D. Ken is entitled to be supplied
with an increased number of
sandwiches he requires as a con

Questions 24 - 27 are based on the
following facts:

While in vacation in Colorado, Donald
bought his daughter, Tiffany, a Slick Sled at
Schwartz' Supplies ("Schwartz"). The sled
was manufactured by Hemsley.

Tiffany and her friends took the sled to a
large hill next to Donald's vacation home,
where Tiffany and her friends rode the sled
down the hill many times. Christopher, the
older brother ofTiffany's friend, Suzy, asked
if he could ride the sled down the mountain
and show Tiffany how to maneuver between
the trees. Tiffany handed the sled to Chris 
topher who got onto the sled and started
down the mountain. As he was whipping in
and out between the trees, the metal runner
on the sled snapped, causing Christopher to
fall off the sled and strike his head on a rock.
Christopher suffered severe head injuries
from the accident. Tina, one of Tiffany's
friends, saw the whole incident and became
very ill and severely upset when she wit 
nessed what happened to Christopher.

It was determined that although most sled
manufacturers used steel runners, which is
a much stronger metal than that used by
Hemsley, the use of steel would increase the
manufacturing cost of each sled by about
$2.25.

24. If Christopher brings an action against
Hemsley based on the theory of strict
liability to recover for his injuries:

23. Assume the same facts in question 22,
except that when Bugs sold his Roach
Coach business, Bugs, Bart and Ken all
mutually agree to substitute Ken for
Bugs in the Roach Coach/Fresh Foods
agreement. Ken does not buy all the
sandwich requirements through Fresh
Foods, but rather buys half of his re 
quirements through another sandwich
maker. If Fresh Foods brings an action
against Bugs, the court will find for:

A. Fresh Foods, because it was a
third party beneficiary to the
Bugs/Ken sale agreement.

B. Fresh Foods, because Bugs, the
assignor, is still liable under the
original contract.

C. Bugs, because the sale of Roach
Coach terminated any further
obligations to purchase sand 
wiches from Fresh Foods.

D. Bugs, because there was a nova

Dave called Conan and told Conan that his
memory had returned and would be perform 
ing his act as scheduled. Conan then tele 
phoned Jay and told him that Jay would not
have to fill in for Dave because Dave's
memory had returned.

38. Jay brings an action against Conan and
Conan raises the defense that there was
no valid acceptance of Conan's offer.
Will Jay prevail?

A. Yes, because Conan did not re 
voke his offer by the same
method he communicated the
offer.

B. Yes, because Jay sent a telegram
stating his acceptance prior to
Conan's attempt to revoke the
offer.

C. No, because there was uncer 

tainty in the salary term.

D. No, because Jay's request for a
limousine constituted a counter 
offer which Conan was free to
reject.

A. No, if Jay was unaware of
Conan's mailing of the letter to
Arsenio.

B. No, if Jay and Arsenio insist on
working for the Comedy Stop.

C. Yes, because Conan's intent was
to hire only one act to replace
Dave.

D. Yes, because Conan, as offeror,

is the master of his offer.

40. Assume that a valid contract was cre 
ated between Conan and Jay, but Conan
no longer wants Jay to perform at the
Comedy Stop because of Dave's recov 
ery, unless he accepts a much smaller
part warming up the audience with a
monologue before Dave's act begins.
Dave will be paid $25,000.00 per week
for his performance and Jay's normal
weekly fee is $15,000.00. Conan offers
to pay Jay $2,500.00 per week for the

lesser work and less than $15,000.00
as his fee, and is unable to obtain other
work during the five-week run of
Dave's act. How much may Jay recover
from Conan per week?

he may buy a much more modest home
and use the remainder of the money to
quietly retire in Florida. Is Mr. Trum

A. Yes, because Mr. Ellis could still
purchase the property back from
Mr. Mapple and be able to pro 
vide the deed to Mr. Trumpery
on March 15.

B. Yes, because Mr. Ellis is not due
to perform until March 15, which

because their income had steadily improved
during the same period of time. After decid

development across town, they both signed
a written contract to buy the home for
$300,000.00 with Cathy, who was the de 
veloper. The contract stated that the Browns
would purchase the home "as long as they
sell their present home for $175,000.00 cash,
and obtain a new loan within the next 90
days."

56. Because the home the Browns intended
to purchase was a bargain price and
because Cathy decided against possi

sale proceeds, she told the Browns the
sale was off the following day - before
the Browns had even put their present
home up for sale. Mr. and Mrs. Brown
filed a lawsuit against Cathy for breach
of contract, but Cathy raised the defense
that there was no consideration for the
contract. Will she be successful with
this defense?

A. No, because Cathy's promise to
sell the new home was consider 
ation for the Browns' promise to
sell their present home.

B. No, because within the Browns'
promise to buy the home from
Cathy is a condition the Browns
make a good faith effort to find
a buyer for their present home.

C. Yes, because the Browns' prom 
ise to sell their home within 90
days was not within Cathy's nor
the Browns' control.

D. Yes, because the Browns had not
changed their position in reliance

lawsuit and presents evidence that the
Browns could have found a buyer for
their home who would have paid

A. Cathy, because the condition of
the Browns' promise to sell their
present home at the stated terms
was excused by their refusal to
make it occur\

B. Cathy, because the terms of the

When Cathy sues, the Browns defend
by asserting the parties had orally
agreed that the Browns' obligation to
buy the new home was conditioned
upon the Browns being able to purchase
a small strip of land adjacent to their
property so that there was enough space
to construct a two-car garage for the
home. The written contract was silent
on the issue of purchasing the adjacent
land. The Browns were unsuccessful in
purchasing the adjacent property. When
the Browns offered evidence of the con

grounds that it violated the Parol Evi

D. Yes, because the violation of
Cal's due process rights, how

Questions 61 - 62 are based on the
following facts:

Sergeant Monday was a detective working
bunko division for a major metropolitan
police department. Jimmy the Rat, an infor 
mant, who has always provided reliable in 
formation to Monday, tells Monday that a
major crime ring is operating in the west side
of the city. The "M.O." of the ring, headed
by Cal Worthless, is to set up a valet park 
ing service at established businesses, oper 
ating legitimately for a short period of time.
Then, at an appropriate date, the car's own 
ers are all swindled out of their vehicles be 
cause they are unaware that they have "vol 
untarily" handed their cars over to the
"criminal element." Because of his success
in the past, Cal has become so brazen as to
take advance orders for vehicles.

Jimmy identifies Cal's current location for
Monday so that contact can be made. Mon 
day meets with Cal and "orders" a late model
black-and-white Ford sedan, with low mile 
age and a V-8 engine. One week later, Cal
contacts Monday, telling him he has obtained
the car. Cal is arrested when he hands the
keys over to Monday.

If Cal claims the defense of entrapment,
will he succeed?

A. No, because Cal's business was
an ongoing criminal enterprise.

opera early one winter evening when it
started to snow. Because the visibility
was reduced to an unsafe distance, he
decided to stop at The Lieutenant, a res 
taurant near the opera house, so that he
could get some dinner and wait out the
storm. At the door, he was requested to
check his coat by the maitre d', obtain

was read by Columbo, disclaimed li 
ability for any loss or damage to the
coat. By the time he had finished his
dinner, the storm had let up, and
Columbo decided to leave for home.
When Columbo presented the ticket and
requested his coat, the coat could not
be located by the coat clerk. If Columbo
brings a conversion action, who will
prevail?

A. The Lieutenant, because the ex

Questions 64 - 67 are based on the
following facts:

Chaulky Cullen, a 5-year-old child movie
star, was attending the taping of the David
Leatherman show as one of David's guests.
Chaulky was brought to David's studio by
his mother, Misty Cullen. Because David is
very good with children, he frequently has
children as guests on his show. Always try 
ing quirky (but usually funny) bits to keep
David's show interesting, his director has set
up an unusual method of entry for his guests.
The method consists of lowering a large cage
from the ceiling, out of which the guest steps
onto the set. The cage and its mechanism
was designed, built and maintained by SBC
Enterprises ("SBC"). The studio in which
the "cage" and the David Leatherman
Show's set is situated is owned by Late Night
Productions ("Late Night"). As Chaulky was
making his entrance,
the cage rapidly
dropped to the ground, injuring him. David
quickly removed Chaulky from the cage and
telephoned for emergency medical care.
Chaulky brings an action for personal injury,
through his guardian ad litem, against David
and SBC.

64. Will Chaulky prevail against David?

A. No, because the primary duty to
supervise Chaulky was by his
mother, Misty.

D. No, because she materially mis

As Ruth approached her eighteenth birthday,
she decided to sell the car she has owned
since her sixteenth birthday. Although
Sandra is 10 years older than Ruth, she is
buying her first car. Sandra takes Ruth's car
for a test drive. Sandra notices that the car
bounces and vibrates severely at freeway
speeds, but is told by Ruth that the vibration
merely means the tires need to be balanced.
What Ruth failed to tell Sandra (and which
was known to Ruth) is that the vibration was
from worn shocks and a bent frame, which
are costly to repair. Sandra agrees to buy the
car for $2,500, and signs an agreement that,
in part, states she will pay Ruth and pick up
the car the following Friday. Sandra contacts
a car repair shop to set an appointment for
tire balancing, only to learn the true nature
and cost of the problem.

76.

If Ruth sues Sandra for breach of con 
tract, because Sandra refuses to follow
through with the purchase, will Ruth
prevail?

A. Yes, because only Ruth can void
the contract based upon Ruth's
infancy.

B. Yes, because Sandra's reliance
on Ruth's representations were

A. Yes, because any claim that Ruth
misrepresented the condition of
the car would be unreasonable.

B. Yes, because Sandra is estopped

at the time their agreement was reduced
to writing. Although Sandra requests
delivery of "Ruth II," Ruth refuses.
Sandra files a breach of contract action
against Ruth seeking to enforce the
agreement as written. Who will prevail?

A. Sandra, because the Parol Evi 
dence Rule bars evidence of the
misidentification of the car Ruth
had put up for sale.

B. Sandra, because the unilateral
mistake was not known to exist
by Ruth.

C. Ruth, because there was no

and Ruth enters "Ruth II" where the li 
cense number information is requested.
The error is not noticed until Sandra is
to take delivery of the car. Ruth deliv 
ers the "Ruth I" vehicle to Sandra, who
refuses to accept it. Because she only
needs one car, Ruth returns with "Ruth
II" and tenders it to Sandra, who refuses
to accept delivery of it as well. The

A. Sandra, because the Parol Evi 
dence Rule does not bar evidence
that Sandra never agreed to pur 
chase "Ruth II."

B. Sandra, because a written agree 
ment entered on the basis of
fraudulent representations fails
to satisfy the Statute of Frauds,

higher quality couch for $1,499.00, pay 
ment within seven days. Priscilla is a
private investor in furniture, and rec 
ognizes the couch as one that formerly
graced the home of Elvis Presley and
was worth at least $15,000.00. The
original cost of the couch was only
$125.00. Mitch confirmed the terms of
sale by sending a remittance invoice to
Priscilla, which was signed and dated
the date Priscilla visited the store. He
also places a "sold" sign on the couch.
Although Priscilla received the invoice,
she had changed her mind about the
couch, and discarded the document.
Mitch sues Priscilla for breach of con 
tract, but she raises the Statute of Frauds
as a defense. Will she prevail?

A. No, because the remittance in 
voice signed by Mitch satisfies
the Statute of Frauds writing re 
quirement.

B. No, because she failed to object
to the terms of the sale as set
forth in the invoice.

94. Assume that a valid contract was cre 
ated between Mitch and Priscilla for the
sale of the couch, but before Priscilla
pays for it, the federal government de 
clares that all commercial sales and pri 
vate use of the former possessions of
Elvis Presley are illegal, and that such
former possessions are declared na 
tional treasures. What is the most cor 
rect statement regarding the rights of
Mitch and Priscilla?

A. Mitch is in breach for his inabil 
ity to tender the couch because
Priscilla's payment of cash is not
prohibited.

B. Priscilla will be entitled to the
benefit of the bargain damages
from Mitch in the amount of
$15,000.00.

C. Mitch is entitled to the purchase
price, but Priscilla is not entitled
to the couch because of the for

D. Mitch is excused from tendering
the couch, and Priscilla is not
obligated to pay the purchase
price.

Questions 95 - 99 are based on the
following facts:

Bob is a crane operator for his employer,
Skyhigh Commercial Construction
("Skyhigh"). Skyhigh has provided the crane
used by Bob, which was purchased from
Casey Equipment, a heavy equipment manu 
facturer owned by Casey. As Bob was oper 
ating the crane one day, the crane tipped over,
resulting in injuries to him. Bob does not
have any knowledge of his conduct imme 
diately before the accident, but a witness
steps forward who states that the crane sud 
denly fell over when Bob slowly extended
the boom of the crane without any load at 
tached. Bob sues Casey for $50,000, on the
basis of defective manufacture and design
of the crane. Another witness states that Bob
had ignored warnings that his load was too
heavy and he had released his load only af 
ter the crane started to severely tilt to one
side. After obtaining the witness statements,
but before trial, Casey offers to settle Bob's
claim for $20,000, which Bob accepts.

95. Assume that Casey refuses to pay the
$20,000 before any other action is taken
by Bob. If Bob sues Casey for $20,000,
what result?

A. Casey prevails, because Bob's
claim was based on evidence that
directly conflicts with the evi 
dence of Casey, and Bob has the
burden of proof on the issue of
liability.

97. Assume that after the settlement agree 
ment is entered into, the witness, who
is favorable to Bob, admits to Casey that
he made up his story, but that Bob did
not know he had done so. Bob has al 
ready dismissed his complaint. Casey
now refuses to pay Bob the settlement
amount. If Bob sues Casey for Casey's
refusal to pay the settlement amount,
what result?

A. Bob prevails, because the settle 
ment was an accord and satisfac 
tion.

B. Bob prevails, because he did not
have knowledge of his witness'
false statement when he entered
the settlement with Casey.

C. Casey prevails, because an ex 
ecutory contract is not enforce 
able as an accord and satisfac 
tion.

D. Casey prevails, because the re 
canted evidence of Bob's expert
indicates there is no longer con 
sideration for the settlement
agreement.

B. Casey prevails, because an ex 
ecutory contract is not enforce 
able as an accord and satisfac 
tion.

C. Bob prevails, because the settle 
ment agreement was enforceable
as a compromise of a disputed
claim.

D. Bob prevails, because tort liabil 
ity is enforceable without consid

96. Assume the same facts as above, ex 
cept that Bob sues Casey for the
$50,000 he initially demanded. Casey
defends on the grounds that his obliga 
tion to pay $20,000 in settlement re 
placed any liability that may be proven 
up at trial. Will Casey's defense suc 
ceed?

A. No, because Casey's promise to
pay $20,000 in settlement was
void ab initio.

B. No, because Bob has the option
of suing on the settlement agree 
ment or the tort theory alleged
in his complaint.

C. No, because its promise was

98. Assume that after Casey entered into the
settlement agreement with Bob, he be 
came unable to pay the $20,000. Bob
threatened to file another lawsuit
against Casey, since he had dismissed
his prior action. Frank hears of Casey's
predicament and tells Bob that he will
pay Bob the $20,000, if Bob agrees not
to file the new lawsuit. Frank is a con 
tractor that has been purchasing Casey's
equipment for years, and has agreed to
the payment out of loyalty to Casey.
Bob agrees, and refrains from filing the
new action. The following day, Frank
informs Bob that he has had a change
of heart and would not be paying the
money. If Bob sues Frank for $20,000,
who prevails?

A. Bob prevails, because his agree 
ment to forbear to sue Casey is
adequate consideration for his
promIse.

B. Bob prevails, because Frank's
loyalty to Casey is sufficient con 
sideration for Frank's promise.

C. Frank prevails, because his
promise is not supported by con 
sideration.

D. Frank prevails, because the rule
on contribution requires that Bob
must first sue Casey and receive
judgment before he can sue on
Frank's promise to pay.

99. Assume the same facts as in Question
98, but that Frank defends on the
grounds that the statute of frauds will
prevent enforcement of the Bob-Frank
agreement. Will Frank prevail on this
ground?

A. Yes, because a promise to forbear
to sue for an amount in excess
of $500 must be evidenced by a
writing.

B. Yes, because the promise to pay
the debt of another must be evi 
denced by a writing.

C. Both A and B are correct.

D. No, because Frank's promise
does not require a writing under

ANSWERS

1. C is the correct answer. Art was under
a pre-existing duty to construct the
home as agreed. Although the tiles
would be difficult to obtain, Art's per 
formance will not be excused under the
doctrine of unanticipated circum 
stances. A, Band D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in answer C.

2. A is the correct answer. Though Bob's
act of meeting with the IRS and reach 
ing a favorable resolution for Art may
have resulted in Art's promise, the
promise was not supported by any con 
sideration. Thus, Bob's promise to in 
stall a Genie door raiser for Art is purely
gratuitous and is unenforceable. B is
incorrect because the parole evidence
rule only applies when a full, complete
integrated written contract is entered
into between the parties. C is incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer A. D is
incorrect because promissory estoppel
is triggered when a gratuitous promise
is likely to, and does, induce the prom 
isee to rely. Here, the facts state that
Art's promise followed Bob's act; there 
fore, Bob was not induced by the prom 
ise.

3. D is the correct answer. Where a con 
tract contains gaps in the terms to be
performed, the court will ordinarily fill
in such gaps by implication, e.g., requir 
ing a garage door opener of the power
rating that is reasonably required. Al 
though Art refused to install the more
powerful motor, he is entitled to pay 
ment of the contract price for his sub 
stantial performance, less Bob's dam 
ages for Art's failure to install the ap 
propriate motor.

4. C is the correct answer. When a par 
tially constructed home is destroyed
accidentally, through no fault of the
parties to the contract, the party con 
structing the home cannot recover for
the work, including material and labor
that was destroyed, because no benefit
has been conferred upon the owner.
Therefore, Art may not recover for pre 
viously completed work. A and Bare
incorrect for the reasons stated for an 
swer C. D is incorrect because the duty
of a contractor to perform on time may
be excused by destruction of the home.

5. A is the correct answer. An express con 
dition that performance must be to the
satisfaction of a third person requires
that the third person's decision be hon 
est and in good faith. However, where
the third person's dissatisfaction is a
gross mistake, the condition of personal
satisfaction will be excused. B, C and
D are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer A.

6. C is the correct answer. Where a plain 
tiff in default (here, University is stand 
ing in Art's shoes as plaintiff) sues to
recover damages, the plaintiff's recov 
ery is measured by the amount of
defendant's enrichment, but not more
than the contract price. A, Band Dare

9. C is the correct answer. Plaintiff may
recover damages for severe emotional
distress caused by observing the negli 
gently inflicted injury of a third person
if, but only if, plaintiff is closely related
to the injured victim, present at the
scene of the injury-producing event at

plaintiff suffering serious emotional
distress. A and B are incorrect for the
reasons stated in answer C. D is incor 
rect because for negligent infliction,
foreseeability is not an element of the
tort.

10. C is the correct answer. A conspiracy is
an agreement between two or more per 
sons to do an unlawful act. Because
Max did not willingly agree to perform
the robbery, but was under the compul 
sion of duress, there was not an agree 
ment between Siegfried and Max such
that it amounted to a conspiracy. A, B,
and D are incorrect because C is cor 
rect.

7. D is the correct answer. False impris 
onment requires a showing of physical
or psychological confinement of an 
other who is conscious of or injured by
the confinement. Because Milton was
not aware of his confinement since he
was asleep, and there are no facts sug 
gesting injury due to the confinement,
Florence is not liable for false impris 
onment. A and B are incorrect for the
reasons stated in answer D. C is incor 
rect because Florence may be found li 
able absent force or threats by creating
a physical barrier of confinement, e.g.,
locking the door.

8. A is the correct answer. Robin must
show that Bank's failure to provide a
security guard or post a sign was the
actual and proximate cause of Mark's
death, in order to impose liability. B is
incorrect because a lack of prior occur 
rences is no defense. C is incorrect be 
cause comparative negligence does not
necessarily provide a complete defense.
D is incorrect because the law as de 
scribed did not violate the U.S. Consti 
tutional prohibition against ex post facto
laws.

11. B is the correct answer. The defense of
duress applies where the conduct of
another caused the defendant to reason 
ably believe that, unless he committed
the crime, he or a third person would
suffer death or serious bodily harm. The
defense of duress applies here because
Siegfried threatened to blow up the
briefcase attached to Max's arm, which
if filled with explosives would most
likely result in his death. Max's reason 
able belief that the briefcase contains
explosives means that the defense ap 
plies, even though the briefcase con 
tained a harmless material. A, C and D
are incorrect because B is correct.

12. D is the correct answer. A person can
commit a crime through an innocent
agent and be subject to conviction as
though he committed the crime himself.
A, Band C are incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in answer D.

13. A is the correct answer. Pursuant to
V.e.e. 2-206, an offer to buy goods
shall be construed as inviting accep 
tance either by a prompt promise to ship
or act of shipment. However, the act of
shipping non-conforming goods is not
only acceptance of the offer, but also a
breach of the accepted contract. B is
incorrect because upon accepting the
goods, a contract was formed and would
place CompuPlay in breach of contract.
C is incorrect because the seller must
seasonably notify the buyer that the
shipment is offered as an accommoda 
tion only. D is incorrect because a buyer
is entitled to a reasonable opportunity
to inspect goods.

14. D is the correct answer. Negligence is
defined as conduct which falls below a
standard of care established by law for
the protection of others from an unrea 
sonable risk of harm. Phil must show
that Continental failed to exercise due
care in maintaining the pipeline before
liability will be imposed. A is incorrect
because the facts state there was no dan 
ger to Phil presented by the leaking
pipeline. B is incorrect because Torts
Restatement 402(A) provides that li 
ability is limited to persons who sell,
produce, or distribute the product. Con 
tinental merely owned and operated the

"requirements" of the buyer. The party
who will determine the quantity amount
is required to exercise good faith and
the contract does not lack mutuality

imposed upon the party determining
quantity. A contract whereby the par

retailer, or supplier of a product who
places an unreasonably dangerous prod 
uct into the stream of commerce will

incorrect because liability for a defec 
tive product will not be imposed if the
product was not unreasonably danger

places an unreasonably dangerous (de 
fective) product into the stream of com 
merce will be strictly liable for injuries

38. B is the correct answer. Under the
"mailbox rule," where the use of U.S.
mail, telegram, or overnight mail ser 
vices is a reasonable method of com 
municating an acceptance, such accep 
tance is generally effective upon dis 
patch and a revocation is generally ef 
fective upon receipt. Thus, even though
Jay received Conan's attempted revo 
cation before Conan received Jay's ac 
ceptance, a contract was formed. Note
that although an offer may invite accep 
tance by either a promise or an act, and
on its face Conan's offer arguably con 
tains language that invites acceptance
by performance, a reasonable interpre 
tation of Conan's offer was that he re 
quired to be contacted prior to Sunday
for acceptance. A is incorrect because
the method of revocation is generally
not limited to the same method as the
communication method of the offer. C
is incorrect because Jay's normal fee
can be objectively determined. D is in 
correct because a request using such
language as "I wish" or "I hope" is con 
sidered to be mere inquiry.

39. A is the correct answer. An offer is an
outward manifestation of present will 
ingness to enter into a bargain, made in
such a way that the person to whom it
is addressed reasonably believes that he

47. C is the correct answer. Where a party
to a contract will be unable to perform
at the time set for his (Mr. Ellis ') per 
formance, i.e., there is a prospective
inability to perform, the other party (Mr.
Trumpery) is excused from holding
himself ready to perform, rendering per 
formance, or tendering performance, as
an implied condition to the duty of the
party who is unable to perform. A, B

48. A is the correct answer. Where a party
repudiates a contract in advance of the
date set for his performance, the inno 
cent party is excused from holding him 
self ready to perform, rendering perfor

a present material breach of the contract

44. D is the correct answer. Although
Charles was mistaken as to his owner

tender of such performance by each
party is an implied condition of the

the fraudulent conversion of rightfully
entrusted personal property. Because
Zeke intended to extinguish the joint
debt, and subsequently did so, with the
money collected from Boyd, an em 
bezzlement occurred. A is incorrect be 
cause of the explanation above. B is

ment. Since Zeke used the money to
extinguish the joint debt of Risk in his
capacity as corporate president, Risk is
liable for the crime. A is incorrect be

56. B is the best answer. A conditional
promise means that the promisor only
needs to perform if a specified condi 
tion occurs, and is recognized as suffi 
cient consideration for a contract where
not illusory. Further, every contract
imposes upon each party a duty of good
faith and fair dealing in its performance
and its enforcement. Thus, the Browns
must use good faith efforts to sell their

obligated to buy the home from Cathy
unless their present home is sold, their
promises are sufficient consideration to
form a contract.

54. D is the correct answer. Generally, ig 
norance or a mistaken belief as to the
law is no defense to criminal liability.
Although such ignorance/mistaken be 
lief is based on the good faith reliance
on an attorney's advice, or as in this case
of defendant's tax accountant, it is no
defense. However, where defendant's
good faith reliance is such that he did
not have the necessary mens rea to com

a defense. If Norm believed in good

the scope of his authority over the chat

However, the question asks about the
liability of David, who is not the land
owner or occupier. Since this answer is

sible situation in which David could be
held liable, it is the only possible cor

ever, a manufacturer is not liable under
a premises liability theory ("abnormally

66. B is the correct answer. In cases involv 
ing a "thin skull" plaintiff, all courts will
hold defendant liable for the full extent
of plaintiff's damages, under the ratio 
nale that a defendant takes the plaintiff

will be liable for the actual amount of

any judgment paid, against the party
primarily responsible for plaintiff's
damages. However, indemnity is also
available where defendants are directly
liable to plaintiff, but there is a great
degree of difference between the cul 
pability of the liable parties. Since this
answer attributes active negligence

it is not entitled to recover any amount

a felony. Since Ben knew of the theft
(and in fact was paid for his services
out of the spoils of the theft), and was
acting to avoid Bonnie and Clyde's ar 
rest, he is guilty of being an accessory
after the fact. A is incorrect because a

sault with a deadly weapon. Although
Jimmy did not strike the actual person

constitute a battery. Attempted murder

to a contract has made a material mis 
representation regarding the subject of
the contract, the contract is voidable by
the innocent party. Since Ruth's state 
ment regarding the defects in her car
were likely to induce Sandra (or a rea 
sonable person) to purchase the car, the
misrepresentation is material. A is in 
correct because it reaches the wrong
conclusion and the contract can be
avoided on grounds other than infancy.
B is incorrect because Sandra's reliance
was reasonable since no facts suggest
that Sandra should have known of the
misrepresentation, and because it was
to be her first car purchase - which in 
dicates lack of sophistication. C is in 
correct because minors may enter into
a contract. The contract is merely void 
able, but may be enforceable if the mi 
nor chooses not to avoid it.

77. C is the correct answer. A contract en 
tered into by a minor is voidable at the
minor's choice, even though the minor
may enforce the contract against an
adult. Since Ruth is a minor and has
stated that she wants to avoid the con 
tract, the contract is not enforceable in
favor of Sandra. A and B are incorrect

contract, and because of the incorrect
conclusion of enforceability. D is incor 
rect because a contract based on mate 
rial fraudulent representations is merely

74. C is the correct answer. D is incorrect
because first degree murder is the pre 
meditated intentional killing of a human
being, or via felony-murder. Here, since

there was no specific intent to kill with
premeditation or deliberation. Further,
felony-murder cannot be used when the
underlying felony involves an attack on

here. (This is called the merger rule).
~econd degree murder requires, essen 
tially, either an intent to kill, or a reck-

acted with reckless disregard of the
truth, she violated constitutional stan 
dards and is, therefore, liable for defa 
mation. A is incorrect because the fact
that Jake's film was doing well does not
mean that Jake did not suffer any dam 
ages as a result of Jean's statements. B
is incorrect because, although opinions
generally have constitutional protec 
tion, opinions are actionable when they
contain known false statements or the
statement was made with reckless dis 
regard for the truth. C is incorrect be

92. C is the correct answer. The Statute of
Frauds requires that a contract for the
sale of goods for $500.00 or more must
be in writing, signed by the party to be
charged, to be enforceable. One excep 
tion to this rule is when both parties are
merchants, and one party sends the
other party a written confirmation
which satisfies the Statute of Frauds as
to the sender, and the party receiving
the confirmation does not send a writ 
ten objection within 10 days (U.e.e. 2 
201). Since Priscilla is not a merchant,
and she did not sign any writing evi 
dencing the terms of the contract, the
contract is unenforceable. A and Bare
incorrect for the reasons C is correct. D
is an incorrect statement of the appli 
cable law.

93. B is the correct answer. Again, the court
ordinarily will not evaluate the ad 
equacy of consideration between par 
ties, as long as the contract is not un 
conscionable. Arguably, payment of
$1,499.00 for a couch valued at
$15,000.00 is not unconscionable such
that the contract is lacking sufficient
consideration. A is incorrect because
there are no facts evidencing detrimen 
tal reliance (such as the loss of a sale of
the subject couch) whereby promissory
estoppel would apply. C is incorrect for
the same reason that B is correct. D is
factually correct, but reaches the wrong
conclusion on the issue of adequacy of
consideration.

90. A is the correct answer. Defamation of
a public person is constitutionally privi 
leged, unless published with knowledge
of falsity or reckless disregard of the
truth. Since this answer presumes that
Tawnya used reasonable care in inves 
tigating Lee, her conduct is not such that
it violated the constitutional standard of
knowing falsity or reckless disregard for
the truth. B is incorrect because Tawnya
will be liable, despite her belief in the
truth, if she exhibited a reckless disre 
gard for the truth. C is incorrect because
the defamation has already occurred,
and a retraction is usually only effec 
tive in limiting general, but not special,
damages. D is incorrect because it sets
forth the incorrect standard for liabil 
ity.

91. B is the correct answer. The general rule
is that an advertisement is not an offer
because it is usually too indefinite and
is construed as an invitation to deal.
Since Mitch's ad did not specify which
couches were offered at the $299.00
price, the ad could not be construed to
invite acceptance to purchase the higher
quality couch at the sale price. A is in 
correct because consideration is not
normally reviewed by the courts for
adequacy as long as the contract is not
unconscionable. It is unlikely the court
would find it unconscionable to pay
$299.00 for a couch listed at $1,499.00,
particularly since no value ofthe higher
quality couch is given in the facts. C
and D are incorrect because the adver 
tisement is not an offer such that Rhoda
may accept the terms of it.

94. D is the best answer. Where perfor 
mance of a contract becomes illegal as
a result of a supervening change in the
law after the contract was entered into,
the promisor's performance is excused.
Thus, Mitch is not obligated to deliver
the couch and Priscilla is not obligated
to pay for it. A, Band C are incorrect
for the same reasons D is correct.

95. C is the correct answer. Public policy
favors compromise settlement of dis 
puted claims, and a settlement agree 
ment is enforceable under contract law.
Therefore, Bob may bring an action to
enforce the Bob-Casey settlement
agreement. Answer A merely sets forth
that a disputed claim exists, but reaches
the wrong conclusion because Bob will
prevail. B is incorrect because an ex 
ecutory settlement agreement is en 
forceable. D is an incorrect statement
of the law.

96. B is the correct answer. After Casey
repudiated the settlement agreement,
Bob has the option of suing on either
his original claim or on the terms of the
settlement. A and D are incorrect state 
ments of the applicable law. C is incor 
rect because settlement agreements on
disputed claims are enforceable, and for
the reasons supporting answer A.

97. B is the best answer. The court will up 
hold the Bob-Casey agreement because
the agreement was not based on any
known misrepresentations of Bob. A is
incorrect because under the facts there
has been no satisfaction. C is incorrect
because courts will usually enforce ex 
ecutory settlement agreements. D is in 
correct because the parties were not
aware of the false statements at the time
they entered into their agreement.

Frank's promise to pay the settlement
amount in exchange for Bob's promise
to forbear to sue Casey forms an en-
forceable contract. B is incorrect be-
cause loyalty does not constitute con-
sideration. C is incorrect because A is
correct. D is incorrect because the Bob-
Frank agreement is a contract that is
enforceable in and of itself, and there-
fore, Bob does not have to first seek his
remedy from Casey.

100. C is the correct answer. Embezzlement
is the fraudulent conversion of right 
fully entrusted property. Since Brock
'yoluntarily gave Derrick the $2,000 for 
Derrick's intended illegal drug pur 
cbase Derrick was in rightful posse!.
_sion of the money. ,Derrick's subse 
quent taking of the money, therefore
is embezzlement. A is incorrect be 
cause a larceny requires that the prop 
erty is not in the rightful possession of
defendant. B is incorrect because it
requires a false statement intended to
obtain title and possession. There was
no false statement at the time posses 
sion was obtained, and legal title was
never obtained. D is incorrect because
it does not address the issue of fajlure
to repay the money, although it is a
legally correct answer.

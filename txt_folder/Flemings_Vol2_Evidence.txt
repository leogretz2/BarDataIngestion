introduce a photograph that shows that
Daisy was riding her bicycle on the
wrong side of the road. Daisy objects
to the introduction of the photograph.
The Court will rule that the photograph
is:

cross-examine Petunia as to the
accuracy of the photograph.

graph was taken by an investiga-
tive agent at the accident scene.

murder of Wife.

to testify to Mistress' reputation in the
community as a "peaceful woman." The

Mistress is innocent.

C. Inadmissible, because Mistress

has not yet testified.

D. Inadmissible, because reputa-
tion evidence is inadmissible to
prove one's character.

3. Mistress calls Westley to testify that

ration of Mistress' present state
of mind.

EVIDENCE 305

6. Joe was robbed by a man carrying an
unusual psychedelic-painted gun. Sam
was arrested and charged with armed
robbery. At trial, the prosecution seeks
to offer evidence that Sam robbed Pete
with the same gun. The Court will rule
the evidence:

A. Inadmissible, because Sam's

good character is at issue.

B. Inadmissible, because this evi-
dence will unduly prejudice
Sam.

C. Admissible, because it shows
that Sam is capable of commit-
ting armed robbery.

D. Admissible, as it tends to iden-
tify Sam as the man who robbed
Joe.

4. Mistress calls Wanda to testify to
her alibi. On cross-examination, the
prosecutor asks, "Aren't you Mistress'

tion:

A. Improper, because the question
goes beyond the scope of direct

is irrelevant.

weighed by the prejudicial ef-
fect.

C. It is a leading question.

D. Prior jury service renders Willy
incompetent as a witness.

Bar was negligent on previous
occasions.

B. Admissible, to show that Joe's
Bar knew precautionary mea-
sures were needed. 

EVIDENCE 307

iu

measures are binding on Joe's
Bar and Grille.

D. Inadmissible, because subse-
quent remedial measures are
not admissible to prove culpable
conduct.

10. Paul offers evidence that the owner of
Joe's Bar and Grille came to see him in
the hospital after the accident, and of-
fered to pay all of his medical expenses.
Owner then stated, "That's the least I

308 EVIDENCE

Questions 11 -12 are based on the
following facts.

Mario and Angelo, young hoodlums, agreed
to "wack" a local competitor who was
muscling in on their boss' turf. If they were
successful, they would be inducted as "blood
members" into the mafia family. Mario and
Angelo successfully completed the "hit" on
Monday, then Mario was to pick up their fee
from the boss himself. Mario was to meet
Angelo at a nearby purveyor of fine Italian
food, Pizza Madre, to split-up the money
on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Angelo was
injured when he fell from the scaffolding
at his job as a painter. When he went to St.
Peters Hospital for examination, he was told
that he would have to stay at the hospital
for a week because his arm and both legs
were broken. Angelo refused and said, "I
have to leave because I have to meet Mario
on Wednesday." Mario and Angelo were
charged with conspiracy.

11. The prosecution offers the doctor's tes-
timony of Angelo's statement into evi-
dence. Angelo objects. What result?

A. Inadmissible, because of the
physician-patient privilege.

B Admissible, only if the admitting
nurse heard the statement.

C. Admissible, because it is not pro-
tected by the physician-patient
privilege.

D. Admissible, because the state-
ment Angelo made was not made
in confidence. 

12. The prosecuting attorney wants to
introduce a letter that Angelo wrote to
Mario before the "hit." Angelo wrote:
"Mario, we should have done it sooner,
I've always wanted to be part of a fam-
ily." It was signed, "Angelo."

B. Inadmissible, because of the at-

torney-client privilege.

C. Admissible, because others were
present at the conference other
than Duce and Attorney.

13. Ace, an employee of Duce Trucking
("Duce"), gets into an auto collision
with Card. Card brings suit against
Duce and Ace, as joint defendants.
Duce and Ace consult an attorney about
the suit. Attorney for Duce and Ace
calls his investigator, Sneak, into the
conference. Sneak makes notes as to
the discussion of what happened.

Card calls Ace to testify to admissions
made by Duce in the conference. Duce
objects. The Court should rule that
Ace's testimony is:

A. Inadmissible, because the best
evidence is Sneak's notes.

14. Poultry sues Duck Co. for injuries sus-
tained when Poultry's truck collided
with Duck's truck. Duck's manager
prepared a report of the accident, at the
request of the company's attorney. Dur-
ing discovery, Poultry demanded that
the report be produced. Will the Court
rule for the production of the report?

A. No, because it is a privileged

communication.

B. No, because the report contains

hearsay.

C. No, because the report is self-

serving.

D. Yes, because business reports are

not privileged.

15. Pat sued David for damage to his
home. The damage resulted from a
chemical explosion from an experiment
David was conducting in the garage.
A relevant fact in Pat's lawsuit is the
magnitude of the explosion. On direct
examination, Pat was asked if he re-
membered the explosion. He stated, "I
recall my daughter, Ella, running out
from her bedroom and screaming that
the bedroom windows had just shat-
tered." Ella is 14-years-old.

David's attorney objects. The Court will
rule Pat's testimony:

A. Admissible, even if Ella is avail-

able to testify.

B. Inadmissible, because Ella is

available to testify.

C. Inadmissible, as hearsay not

within any exception.

ment, Deft's attorney states that Deft
didn't know the leases were phony. At
trial, the prosecution seeks to introduce
evidence that Deft had, on five other
occasions, set up phony condo deals.
Deft's attorney objects. The Court will
rule that the evidence is:

cannot be proved by instances of
misconduct.

defraud.

D. Admissible, to show Deft's char-

acter for honesty.

17. Farmer John sues Jolly Rancher for
damages done to Farmer's crops by
Rancher's cow. Farmer offers testimony
that he looked up Rancher's telephone
number in the telephone book. Farmer
proceeded to call that number and a
voice answered saying, "This is Jolly
Rancher." Farmer then asked, "Was
it your cow that trampled my sweet
peas?" The voice replied, "Yes." The
Court should rule the testimony:

A. Admissible, because Rancher
identified himself as the speaker,
coupled with the accuracy of the
telephone book, and the phone
transmission system, furnishes
sufficient authentication.

B. Admissible, because judicial
notice may be taken of telephone
books.

C. Inadmissible, unless Farmer
can prove he is familiar with
Rancher's voice.

D. Inadmissible, unless Rancher
has been given the opportunity
to admit or deny whether the
conversation took place or not.

18. Prissy sues Evil for injuries received in
a motorcycle accident. Prissy alleges
that Evil was speeding and driving reck-
lessly, and performing dangerous stunts
on the public highway. Prissy calls Ed
to testify that Evil has the reputation in
the community of being a "dare devil"
rider and frequently performs danger-
ous stunts on the public highways. The
Court will rule Ed's testimony:

Questions 19 - 20 are based on the
following facts.

Porter sues David for personal injuries re-
sulting from a car accident. Porter alleges
the collision was caused by David's running
a red light. Porter calls Witt to testify that
David's car, in which he was riding, ran
the red light. Witt, however, testified that
David's car did not run the red light.

19. Porter then calls Valor to testify that
David's car did run the red light. The
Court should rule that Valor's testimony
is:

A. Admissible, because it shows
Evil is a negligent motorcycle
rider.

B. Admissible, because it is habit

evidence.

C. Inadmissible to show negli-

gence.

D. Inadmissible, because Evil has
not offered testimony of his good
character.

A. Admissible, because Valor's
testimony is relevant to material
issues.

B. Admissible, because Porter was
surprised by Witt's testimony.

C. Inadmissible, because Porter is
bound by Witt's testimony.

D. Inadmissible, because Porter
cannot impeach his own wit-
ness.

20. On cross-examination Valor is asked
by David's attorney if he was "high"
at the time he witnessed the collision.
Valor replied, "No, I have never touched
alcohol or drugs in my life." David's
attorney now seeks to introduce testi-
mony of Tattle that Valor had been high
from a joint he smoked at a party 18
months previous. The Court will rule
Tattle's testimony:

There were several witnesses at the scene of
the accident. Jogger alleges that Driver was
under the influence when he struck him.

21. Jogger's counsel calls Polly who was
a passenger in Driver's car along with
her sister Dolly. Polly testifies that
just before the accident Dolly yelled
out, "Be careful, there is a man in the
crosswalk." The Court will rule this
testimony:

A. Inadmissible, because the state-
ment preceded the accident.

B. Inadmissible, because Dolly is

available as a witness.

C. Inadmissible, as hearsay not

within any exception.

D. Admissible, as an excited utter-

ance.

22. Jogger's counsel next calls Policeman
who testifies, "Polly, the passenger,
said, 'We hit Jogger while he was in
the crosswalk'. Driver was present but
remained silent." The Court will rule
this testimony:

A. Admissible, because Polly's
statement is imputed to Driver.

B. Admissible, as a party admis-

sion.  

C. Inadmissible, because Driver
probably was just experiencing
shock.

D. Inadmissible, unless Driver has

already testified.

23. Jogger's counsel desires to introduce
Jogger's testimony that the day after the
accident Jogger said, "My hip must be
fractured, it is killing me." The Court
will rule the testimony:

A. Inadmissible, because it is self-

serving.

B. Inadmissible, as hearsay not

within any exception.

C. Admissible, as a statement de-
scribing the declarant's physical
condition.

D. Admissible, to prove Jogger's

hip was fractured.

24. Counsel for Jogger seeks to introduce
evidence that after the accident, Driver
offered $3,000 to Jogger to settle the
claim. The Court will rule this evi-
dence:

A. Inadmissible, because of public

policy.

B. Inadmissible, because it is not
relevant to the question of dam-
ages.

C. Admissible, as a party admis-

sion.

D. Admissible, but only if the judge
gives an instruction that the
statement only goes to liability,
not damages.

25. On the day after the accident, Polly
passenger wrote a letter to Uncle Solly
describing the details of the accident.
At trial, Polly cannot remember some
details of the accident. Jogger's coun-
sel wants to show Polly her letter over
the objection of Driver's attorney. The
Court should:

A. Allow the letter under past recol-

lection recorded.

B. Allow the letter under present

recollection refreshed.

C. Disallow the letter because it
was written one day after the
accident.

D. Disallow the letter because the

letter is self-serving.

26. Candy sues Bill for defamation. Candy

and employer that she once was a "call

dicial effect outweighs any pro-
bative value. 

27. Felicia, a divorcee who despises her
ex-husband, Stan, reads in the paper
that he is being tried for fraudulent
stock transactions. Felicia remembers
that while she was married to Stan, he
had explained the scheme to her. Felicia
wants to testify for the prosecution. Stan
objects. Will the Court allow Felicia to
testify?

A. Yes, because once the marriage is
dissolved the privilege no longer
exists.

B. Yes, because Stan committed a

crime.

C. No, because it was a confidential
communication made during
marriage.

D. No, because Felicia is only doing

it out of spite for Stan.

314 EVIDENCE

Push sues Shove for injuries Push received
in an auto accident. Push alleges that Shove
was exceeding the speed limit and was weav-
ing over the center line.

28. Walt is called as an eyewitness by Push.
Walt testifies, on direct examination,
that Shove was wearing a red jacket at
the time of the accident. Shove's coun-
sel calls Wally to testify that Shove's
jacket was green. Wally's testimony
is:

A. Admissible, as tending to prove

a material fact.

truthfulness.

C. Inadmissible, because Walt's ca-
pacity to observe is not at issue.

D. None of the above.

29. Shove testifies that he was only driv-
ing 30 m.p.h. Counsel for Push does
not cross-examine Shove as to speed.
Instead, he calls Officer to testify that
Shove stated to Officer that he was
driving 40 m.p.h.. The Court will find
Officer's testimony:

A. Inadmissible, because it is hear-
say not within any exception.

dation was laid.

C. Admissible, as a prior inconsis-

tent statement.

D. Admissible, as an admission.

However, Hilda calls Lionel to testify
that Hilda has a reputation for non-
violence. Will the Court allow Lionel's
testimony?

A. Yes, as an offer of evidence to
show Hilda's good character.

B. No, because character evidence
is not admissible to support a
defendant's claim she is innocent
of the crime.

C. No, because Hilda has not yet

taken the stand.

D. None of the above.

31. Don Perry, a physician, called as a
witness by the defendant in the case of

EVIDENCE 315

Q

Questions 32 - 33 are based on the
following facts:

Lawyers Abel and Baker are the members
of the law partnership of Abel & Baker, in a
small town that only has one other lawyer.
Abel and Baker do primarily personal injury
work. Client was severely and permanently
injured in an automobile collision when
struck by an automobile driven by Driver.
Client employed the Law Offices of Abel &
Baker to represent her. At the time Client em-
ployed the firm, the statute of limitations had
six weeks to run on her claim. The complaint
was never prepared, nor filed. Abel and
Baker each thought that the other had filed
the complaint. The statute of limitations on
Claimant's claim has run against Driver.

Client has filed suit against Abel and Baker
for negligence. This case is on trial with a
jury.

32. In order to establish a breach of standard
of care owed to her by Abel and Baker,
Client:

A. Must have a legal expert from
the same locality testify that de-
fendant's conduct was a breach.

B. Must have a legal expert from
the same state testify that defen-
dants' conduct was a breach.

C. Can rely on the application of the
jurors' common knowledge as to
whether there was a breach.

316 EVIDENCE

D. Can rely on the judge, as an
expert in law, to advise the jury
whether there was a breach.

33. In addition to proving that Abel and
Baker were negligent, Client must pres-
ent evidence that she:

A. Would have, but for her lawyers'
negligence, recovered against
Driver.

B. Had a good faith claim against

Driver.

C. Was severely and permanently
injured, when struck by Drivers'
automobile.

D. Did not contribute to her own

injuries.

34. Paul sued Hotel 6 for injuries he sus-
tained in a fall in the hotel lobby. The
lobby floor was covered with tile. The
evidence was that the lobby floor had
been waxed approximately an hour
before Paul slipped on it and, although
the wax had dried, there appeared to be
excessive dried wax caked on several
tiles. Hotel 6 denied Paul's claim that
it was negligent. Hotel 6 offered proof
that the week before Paul's fall, at least
11,000 people had walked across the
lobby floor without incident. The trial
judge should rule the evidence:

A. Admissible, because it tends to
prove that Paul did not use rea-
sonable care. 

B. Admissible, because it tends to
prove that Hotel 6 was careful
in maintaining the floors.

C. Admissible, because it proves
that no dangerous condition ex-
isted.

D. Inadmissible, because it does
not bear on the issue of Hotel
6's exercise of due care on this
occasion.

35. Defendant was on trial for murder. The
only eyewitness to the crime was Zack,
whose testimony was largely uncor-
roborated by other evidence. Zack was
called by the prosecution to testify to
what he saw on the night in question.
Defendant's counsel objects to Zack
testifying on the ground that Zack
was incompetent to testify by reason
of a long history of mental illness.
Defendant's counsel offered documen-
tary evidence to the court that Zack had
recently been in a mental institution,
and moved to have the court order Zack
to submit to a psychiatric examination.
The court denied the motion. Did the
court make an error in permitting Zack
to testify?

A. No, because a person who has
a mental illness or defect is not
competent to testify .

B. No, because Zack was the only
witness to the crime.     

C. Yes, because a mentally-ill per-
son is disqualified from testify-
ing.

D. Yes, unless Zack was insane.

36. Cam sued Dan for injuries suffered by
Cam when their automobiles collided.
At trial, Cam offers into evidence a
properly authenticated letter from Dan
that says, "Your claim seems too high,
but because I might be found at fault,
I'm prepared to offer you half of what
you ask." The letter is:

A. Admissible, as an admission.

B. Admissible, as a statement
against Dan's pecuniary inter-
est.

C. Inadmissible, as hearsay.

D. Inadmissible, because Dan's
statement was made in an effort
to settle a claim.

EVIDENCE 317

A. Jamie first proves that Sarah was
an employee of Powell Corpo-
ration at the time she wrote her
statement, and that the statement
concerned a matter within the
scope of her employment.

B. Jamie produces independent
evidence that Adam was not
wearing his glasses.

C. Sarah is shown to be beyond the

court's subpoena power.

D. The statement was made under

oath in an affidavit form.

39. Powell's counsel seeks to have Officer
testify that while he was investigating
the accident Jamie told him , "This was
my fault." The evidence is:

A. Admissible, since it is exempted

from the hearsay rule.

B. Admissible, as an exception to

the hearsay rule.

C. Admissible, as a declaration

against interest.

D. Inadmissible, since it is hearsay
not within any exception.  

Questions 37 - 39 are based on the
following facts:

Jamie and two passengers, Buddy and
Charles, were injured when their car was
struck by a truck owned by Powell Corpo-
ration. The truck was driven by Powell's
employee, Adam. Sarah, also a Powell em-
ployee, was riding in the truck. The issues in
Jamie v. Powell Corp. include the negligence
of Adam in driving too fast, and in failing to
yield the right-of-way.

37. Jamie's counsel offers evidence that,
shortly after the accident, Powell Cor-
poration put a speed governor on the
truck involved in the accident. The
evidence is:

A. Admissible, as an admission.

B. Admissible, as a declaration

against interest.

C. Inadmissible, as a subsequent

remedial repair.

D. Inadmissible, because it would
lead to the inference that Powell
Corporation was at fault.

38. Jamie's counsel seeks to introduce Sar-
ah's written statement that Adam had
left his glasses (which he is required to
wear while operating a motor vehicle)
at the restaurant where they had lunch
just before the accident. The statement
is admissible against Powell Corpora-
tion, if:

318 EVIDENCE

   
40. Birdie was arrested and charged with
illegally driving a stolen vehicle across
the state line. Evidence was presented
that he drove the car from New York to
Chicago. The judge took judicial notice
of the fact that it was impossible to drive
from New York to Chicago without
crossing the state line. The judge's tak-
ing of judicial notice:

A. Satisfied the prosecutor's burden
of production on that point.

B. Shifted the burden to Birdie, to
present evidence in rebuttal.

C. Shifted the burden on Birdie, to
prove that he did not drive from
New York to Chicago.

D. Conclusively proved the point,
that to drive from New York
to Chicago, state lines were
crossed.

41. In a negligence action, Abel testified
against Dave. Dave then called Willy
to testify that Abel once perpetrated a
hoax on the Church of Saint Francis.
Willy's testimony is:

A. Admissible, because a hoax in-

volves untruthfulness.

B. Admissible, provided that the
hoax resulted in conviction of
Abel.

m

F7
m

C. Inadmissible, because it is im-
peachment of a collateral mat-
ter.

D. Inadmissible, because it is ex-
trinsic evidence of a specific
instance of misconduct.

42. At the trial of Bill for a murder that
occurred in Newport, the prosecution
called Wally, who testified that he saw
Bill kill the victim. Bill believed that
Wally was 200 miles away in San Di-
ego, engaged in a narcotics deal with
George, a mutual acquaintance, on the
day in question. On cross-examination
by Bill, Wally was asked whether he
had, in fact, been in San Diego purchas-
ing narcotics on that date. Wally refused
to answer the question on self-incrimi-
nation grounds.

The judge ordered Wally to answer the
question, or his testimony would be
stricken from the record. The order to
testify or have the testimony stricken
can best be supported on the basis
that:

A. Wally had not been charged with
any crime and, thus, could claim
no privilege.

B. Wally's proper invocation of the

44. In a suit attacking the validity of a trust
executed ten years ago, Plaintiff alleges
mental incompetency of Jack, the set-
tlor, and offers into evidence a properly
authenticated affidavit of Henry, Jack's
brother. The affidavit stated that Henry
had observed Jack closely over a period
of a month, that Jack had engaged in
instances of unusual behavior (which
were described), and that Jack's appear-
ance had changed from being neat, alert
and aware, to disordered and absent-
minded. The judge should rule Henry's
affidavit:

A. Inadmissible, as opinion.

B. Inadmissible, as hearsay, not

within any exception.

C. Admissible, since the declaration
was the best evidence that the
statement was made.

D. Admissible, as an official state-

ment.

45. Allen and Neal were arrested for armed
robbery. They were taken to the police
station and placed in an interrogation
room. After the police officer gave
them their Miranda warning, Allen
said, "Look, Neal planned the whole
thing, we robbed the place, and I was
dumb enough to follow along." Neal
said nothing. Neal was then taken to
another room, and a full confession was
obtained from Allen. 

C. The public interest in allowing
an accused to defend himself
outweighs the interest of a non-
party witness in the privilege.

D. The trial record does not estab-
lish that Wally's answer could be
incriminating.

43. Dick is being prosecuted for burglary.
At trial, Dick testifies on his own be-
half, denying that he had committed
the burglary. On cross-examination,
the prosecution asks Dick whether he
had been convicted ten years ago for
burglary. The question of the earlier
burglary conviction is:

A. Proper, if the court determined
that its probative value out-
weighed its prejudicial effect.

B. Proper, because the prosecutor
is entitled to make such an in-
quiry.

C. Improper, because it is character

evidence.

D. Improper, because the conviction
is ten years old, and the defense
must have been given notice of
its use prior to trial.

320 EVIDENCE

If Neal is brought to trial for armed
robbery, the fact that Neal failed to ob-
ject to Allen's statement and remained
silent, is:

A. Admissible, as an admission.

B. Admissible, because a state-
ment of a participant in a crime
is admissible against another
participant.

A. Admit the invoice, only because
it is a record of regularly con-
ducted business activity.

B. Admit the invoice, only because
it is recorded recollection. 

C. Admit the invoice, because it
would qualify as a business
record and as a record of recol-
lection.

C. Inadmissible, because it is hear-

say.

D. Exclude the invoice, as hearsay

not within any exception.

D. Inadmissible, because, under the
circumstances, there was no duty
for Neal to respond.

47. James, while crossing the street at the
intersection of Nutwood and State Col-
lege, was hit by a car driven by Ginger.
James sued Ginger for his injuries.

46. A case of whiskey was stolen from
a Johnny Walker truck when it was
parked outside the Western Saloon. At
trial, to prove that the whiskey was on
the truck, Loaden, the Johnny Walker
shipping manager, was called by the
prosecution to testify. Loaden testified
that he did not have first-hand knowl-
edge that the whiskey was aboard the
truck. Thereupon, the prosecution asked
Loaden, "Did you receive a shipping
invoice listing the contents on that
truck for that particular day?" Loaden
replied, "Yes, I did receive from the
shipping clerk an invoice listing the
merchandise, as customary." Loaden
then produced the invoice. If the pros-
ecuting attorney offers the invoice into
evidence, the trial judge should:

At trial, James called Officer Sparky
to testify that, ten minutes after the
accident, a bus driver stopped and said
to him, "Officer, a few minutes ago I
saw a hit and run accident at Nutwood
and State College involving a red truck
and a pedestrian. I followed the truck
to McPlace for Ribs, on Third Avenue."
Sparky's testimony should be:

A. Admissible, as a present sense

impression.

B. Admissible, as a statement of

perception.

Questions 48-50 are based on the
following facts:

Raymond, a Hallmark salesman, was a guest
at the Holiday Hotel in Arizona. After check-
ing into the hotel, he went to the elevator on
the lobby level floor to proceed to his room.
When the elevator doors opened, he stepped
into the elevator shaft, unaware that the
elevator car itself had not descended to the
lobby. Raymond fell 10 feet to the elevator
shaft floor. The elevator actually was out of
service because it was being repaired that
day. Raymond sues the hotel, claiming he
suffers from permanent injuries as a result
of the incident.

At trial, Raymond proposed to testify that
he called out after the incident, "I have just
fallen while getting into the lobby elevator
and my knee really hurts." The only response
was from Jean Paul, the concierge, who said,
"Hold on, I'll get some help." Jean Paul ob-
served Raymond later that day swimming in
the hotel pool.

48. Raymond's proposed testimony re-
garding his statement to the concierge
should be:

A. Admitted, as a statement of pres-

ent physical condition.

B. Admitted, as evidence of liability

against the hotel.

C. Excluded, because the statement
was not made to a treating doc-
tor.  

322 EVIDENCE

D. Excluded, because Raymond
is not qualified as an expert to
determine his own medical con-
dition.

49. Assume for this question, that Raymond
intends to offer testimony that he never
complained of knee pain prior to his
fall. Raymond's proposed testimony re-
garding the absence of prior complaints
of knee pain is:

A. Admissible, because the state-

ment is reliable.

B. Admissible, because the state-
ment relates to a condition per-
ceivable by a lay person.

C. Admissible, because Raymond
may give an opinion as to his
own diagnosis and required treat-
ment.

D. None of the above.

50. Assume for this question, that Raymond
seeks to exclude certain statements
he made to his general physician, Dr.
Cure, 3 years before the incident. On
that occasion, Raymond told Dr. Cure,
"I awoke this morning with severe knee
pain, after I helped a college buddy with
moving yesterday." The hotel seeks to
admit Raymond's prior statement to Dr.
Cure over Raymond's objection. The
statement is:

A. Admissible, because the state-
ment contradicts Raymond's
claim that he had no prior in-
jury.

B. Admissible, because the state-
ment relates to Raymond's medi-

C. Inadmissible, because the state-
ment is protected from disclosure
by the physician-patient privi-
lege.

D. None of the above.

Questions 51-52 are based on the
following facts:

Paul sues Don for personal injuries that
he suffered when he was struck by Don's
bicycle. Don's bicycle hit Paul as he was
walking across South Crest Plaza's parking
lot. Immediately after the accident, Don ran
over to Paul and said, "I know I was doing
a wheelie, but you were looking in your
shopping bag instead of where you were
walking. But, if you're hurt, I'll pay your
medical bills."

51. At trial, Paul calls as his first witness,
Stan, who was an eyewitness to the ac-
cident. Stan proposes to testify that he
heard Don tell Paul, "I know I was do-
ing a wheelie." Don's attorney objects.
If Stan's testimony is admitted, it will
most likely be admitted because the
proffered evidence is:

A. Admissible, as an opinion.

B. Admissible, as a party admis-

sion.

C. Admissible, as a present sense

impression.

D. Admissible, as a declaration

against interest.

52. Suppose that on cross-examination
Don's attorney asks Stan if he heard
Don's entire statement. Stan responds
affirmatively. Don's attorney now seeks
to have Stan testify to Don's complete
statement. Paul's attorney objects. The
trial judge should:

324 EVIDENCE

A. Sustain the objection, because
the police report is the best evi-
dence of Don's statement.

B. Sustain the objection, in the
interest of humanitarian consid-
erations.

C. Overrule the objection, because
Paul's attorney opened to the
door to the admission of the
remainder of Don's statement to
Paul pertaining to the cause of
the accident.

D. Overrule the objection, because
statements should be offered in
their entirety.

53. Larry was charged with vehicular bat-
tery after driving through a red light
and crashing his Cadillac into Marie's
Lotus. Marie suffered massive internal
injuries and lapsed into a coma until
several hours after she reached the
hospital. Sharon, Marie's best friend,
was a passenger in her car. Sharon mi-
raculously received only a few minor
bruises. After the collision, Sharon
stayed with Marie, trying to comfort
her until the ambulance arrived.

At trial, Sharon is called to the stand by
the district attorney, who asks Sharon if
Marie said anything to her before being
taken to the hospital. Sharon answers
affirmatively, and testifies that Marie
was conscious for a few brief moments
after the accident when she had stated,
"He never stopped for that red light."  

Upon objection by Larry's attorney, the
court should rule the testimony con-
cerning Marie's statement to Sharon:

A. Inadmissible, because Marie's

statement is hearsay.

B. Inadmissible, because Marie's
statement lacks trustworthiness.

C. Admissible, as a present sense

impression by Marie.

D. None of the above.

54. A tall man with red hair robbed Bob's
liquor store. Later, Pete was arrested
and charged with the armed robbery.
At Pete's trial, several eyewitnesses
testified they had seen a tall red-haired
man pull out a gun and rob Mr. Bob,
the store's owner. Pete appeared at trial
with a shaved head. The prosecution
calls Deputy Fife to testify that Pete
had red hair when he was first brought
to jail. Pete's attorney objects. The trial
judge should rule Fife's testimony is:

A. Admissible, as a prior identifica-

tion.

B. Admissible, for the limited pur-
pose of clarifying the discrep-
ancy in the witness' testimony.

C. Inadmissible, as hearsay not

within any exception.

D. Inadmissible, because it is opin-

ion.

55. Fred and Wilma Strong had been mar-
ried for thirty years. Late one Sunday
afternoon, while on his way home from
the pub, Fred hit a young child with his
car and drove off. The young child died
and, after months of police investiga-
tion, Fred was charged with vehicular
manslaughter. Thereafter, Fred called
Attorney to set up a meeting, in order
to retain him for the pending trial.

At the consultation with Attorney, Fred
was accompanied by Wilma. During the
conference, Secretary took notes of the
meeting. A month later, Secretary quit
her job. Fred decided not to hire Attor-
ney, but to act in pro per instead. Dur-
ing Fred's trial, the prosecution called
Secretary to testify to what was said at
the initial conference. The proposed
testimony is:

A. Admissible, because Fred did not

hire Attorney.

B. Admissible, because Secretary's
presence at the conference de-
stroyed the privilege.

C. Inadmissible, because of the at-

torney-client privilege.

D. Inadmissible, as hearsay, not

within any exception.

EVIDENCE 325

56. In a battery action against Katz by
Doug, Doug's attorney called Mel to
testify that the incident occurred on
December 23. Although Mel was not
questioned about a deposition he made
before trial, Mel had previously testi-
fied at his deposition that the incident
occurred on December 14. After Mel's
trial testimony, Katz's attorney offers
Mel's deposition into evidence. The
trial judge should rule the deposition:

A. Admissible, as substantive evi-
dence the incident occurred on
December 14.

B. Inadmissible, because Mel was
available to testify at the trial.

C. Inadmissible, as hearsay not

within any exception.

D. Inadmissible, because there were
no facts showing that Mel was
intentionally untruthful.

Questions 57-58 are based on the
following facts:

One morning, Don telephoned his best
friend, Troy, and asked him if he could
borrow his car. Don explained to Troy that
he had an audit scheduled with the Internal
Revenue Service, which he had to attend and
he needed his car to get there. Don promised
Troy that he would return the car late that
afternoon. Troy agreed to allow Don to bor-
row his car. While driving Troy's car, Don
was involved in an automobile accident
with Bud. Bud has filed suit against Troy
for negligence.

57. In his case in chief, Bud calls Vic to
testify to three incidents of careless
driving on Don's part. The trial judge
should rule the testimony:

A. Admissible, as circumstantial
evidence that Don was negligent
on that occasion.

B. Admissible, since Vic had per-
sonal knowledge of Don's poor
driving.

C. Admissible against Troy, as evi-
dence of Don's lack of fitness.

D. Inadmissible, as hearsay not

within any exception.

58. In his defense, Troy offered testimony
of his wife, Winnie, that Don had a
reputation as a careful driver. Winnie's
testimony is:

D. Inadmissible, because of bias.

59. Sally is charged with murder for shoot-
ing Brian with her gun. Sally testified
at trial that she honestly believed that
Brian had already died from a heart
attack before he was shot. In rebuttal,
the district attorney called Virginia to
testify that, just before she saw Sally
shoot Brian, she heard Brian shout, "I'm
going to die."

Sally's attorney objects to Virginia's
proposed testimony on grounds that
it is inadmissible hearsay. If the trial
court judge overrules the objection, the
reason will most likely be that:

A. Although hearsay, Brian's state-
ment was made in the belief of
impending death.

B. Although hearsay, Brian's state-
ment related to his present physi-
cal condition.

C. It was not hearsay, because Bri-
an's statement is admissible to
show "notice or knowledge" by
Sally that Brian was still alive.

D. It was not hearsay, because Vir-
ginia had firsthand knowledge of
the events as they transpired.

60. Polly sues Marie, an artist, and Ben,
an art gallery owner, for libel. Polly's
complaint alleges that Marie painted a
picture portraying a figure recognized
as Polly engaging in sexual conduct,
and the painting was published by
allowing the painting to be publicly
displayed. Further, Ben also published
the libelous painting by hanging the
painting for public viewing in his art
gallery and where it was viewed by
the people visiting his gallery. At trial,
Polly offers testimony of Witness that
he was present in Ben's gallery and ob-
served Ben hanging the picture. Witness
further offers to testify as to the scene
portrayed in the picture and that the
picture was signed with Marie's name
in the lower right-hand corner. Upon
proper objection the court should rule
Witness' testimony:

A. Inadmissible, because Witness'
testimony is not the best evi-
dence.

B. Inadmissible, because Witness'
description of the picture, as
against Ben, is insufficiently
authenticated.

C. Admissible, because Witness
properly authenticated the paint-
ing by identifying the artist who
signed the painting as Marie.

Questions 61 - 62 are based on the
following facts:

in which he is testifying to.

Winona sues Bob for the wrongful death of
her husband, Henry. At trial, Winona offers
the testimony of Henry's business partner,
Paul, who states that the average net profit
from the business of each partner over the
preceding five years was $100,000. Fur-
ther, evidence is presented showing that the
partnership books are in Paul's possession
and that Paul is willing to allow for their
inspection.

61. The testimony of Paul is:

A. Admissible, since the informa-
tion is relevant and the books are
available for inspection.

B. Admissible, since the facts
sought prove the earnings of the
partnership and Paul had per-
sonal knowledge of those facts.

C. Inadmissible, as hearsay not fall-

ing within any exception.

D. Inadmissible, because Paul's tes-
timony is not the best evidence. 

328 EVIDENCE

62. Assume that Paul's testimony is inad-
missible. Winona now offers the testi-
mony of a properly-qualified expert,
Alvin, a certified public accountant,
who states that he had reviewed the
books of the partnership covering the
preceding five years and, that in his
opinion, the books reflect an average
annual profit for that period allocable to
Henry of $100,000. Upon objection, the
court should rule Alvin's testimony:

A. Admissible, because Alvin has
personal knowledge of the earn-
ings, and is a qualified expert.

B. Inadmissible, because of the best

evidence rule.

C.

Inadmissible, because Alvin does
not have personal knowledge of
the facts to which he is testify-
ing.

D. Inadmissible, as hearsay not fall-

63. Greg dies, leaving a will by which
he bequeaths his entire estate to his
friend, Bobby. Peter, Greg's only heir
at law, brings a suit to contest the will
on grounds of incapacity. At the trial,
Bobby calls Dr. Jan and Mrs. Alice as
witnesses, both of whom offer to testify
affirmatively when asked whether Greg
knew enough about "the nature and
extent of his property, and the natural
objects of his bounty" at the time of
Greg's execution of the will. Other
evidence has shown: (1) that Mrs. Alice
is Greg's former housekeeper, who had
seen him daily for over 25 years, until
the date of Greg's death; and (2) that Dr.
Jan is a psychiatrist, stipulated by the
parties to be qualified, who had occa-
sion to examine Greg the week before
Greg executed his will. Upon objection,
the court should:

A. Exclude the testimony of both
witnesses, because both are at-
tempting to testify to their opin-
ions on an ultimate issue in the
case.

B. Admit Dr. Jan's testimony, and
exclude Mrs. Alice's testimony.

C. Admit Mrs. Alice's testimony,

negative.

C. Improper impeachment.

D. Improper, because specific in-
stances of misconduct may not
be used to impeach.

66. Terry and Larry were indicted for con-
spiracy to sell an illegal substance. Dan,
an undercover agent, was the key wit-
ness. Terry and Larry claim entrapment
as their defense.

At trial, Dan testifies for the prosecution
that he was present at a meeting with
the defendants at the Grand Hotel on
July 7, at which Terry and Larry agreed
to sell two kilos of cocaine to Dan for
$150,000.

Thereafter, the defense calls as a wit-
ness Tom, an old college roommate
of Dan's, to testify that Dan once
purchased marijuana. Tom's proposed
testimony is:

A. Admissible, because the pur-
chase of marijuana is probative
of Dan's untruthfulness.

B. Admissible, provided that the
purchase of the marijuana re-
sulted in a criminal conviction. 

64. Baby sued Dan for damages, for injuries
that Baby incurred when a badly rotted
limb fell from a tree in front of Dan's
home and hit Baby. Dan claimed that
the tree was on city property; thus, was
not liable to Baby for his injuries. At
trial, Baby offers testimony that a week
after the accident, Dan had the tree cut
down. The evidence is:

A. Inadmissible, since such is
against public policy so as to
further safety precautions.

B. Inadmissible, since it is irrel-

evant.

C. Admissible, to show that the tree

was on Dan's property.

D. Admissible to show that the tree

was in rotten condition.

65. Nancy was prosecuted for the murder
of Merry. At trial, Anna testified against
Nancy. On cross-examination, Nancy's
attorney asked Anna the following
question, "Isn't it true that charges
against you as an accomplice in Merry's
murder are being dropped in exchange
for your testimony against Nancy?" The
question is:

A. Proper impeachment, because it
shows Anna has a self-interest in
testifying against Nancy.

C.

Inadmissible, because it is extrin-
sic evidence.

D. Inadmissible, as improper lay
opinion in regard to whether or
not the substance previously pur-
chased by Dan was marijuana.

67. Victim was injured in an automobile
accident and rushed to the emergency
room at Hospital. Victim subsequently
brought an action against Hospital for
malpractice, claiming that Hospital
delayed in giving her prompt medical
attention, which resulted in a delay in
her recovery period.

At trial, Nurse proposes to testify that
when Victim was brought into the
emergency room she was unconscious.
Victim's attorney objects. The trial
judge should:

A. Sustain the objection, because
Nurse is not a qualified expert.

B. Sustain the objection, because
it goes to an ultimate issue of
fact.

C. Overrule the objection, because
Jogger can corroborate her testi-
mony.

D. Overrule the objection, because
Nurse had observed Victim when
she was brought into the hospi-
tal.

lawyer, Parker, to handle the case.

At trial, Denny's attorney calls Jacoby
to testify what Stan had said to him in
regard to his physical condition dur-
ing the consultation that he (Jacoby)
had with Stan and his father. Jacoby's
testimony is:

A. Admissible, because no attorney-
client relationship existed.

B. Admissible, because the element
of confidentiality is not satisfied
when a third person is present
with the attorney and client.

ployment contract by Paul. Paul hired
Cam to obtain a patent on all his inven-
tions within 30 days of their finalization
stage. The day of the finalization of the
Zit Zap Gun is in question. Paul claims
that the finalization date was May 1
1992. Cam claims that it was June 1
1992.

At trial, Cam is called to testify. His
counsel asks him if he is certain about
the date, June 1, 1992, on which the Zit
Zap Gun was finalized. Cam replies,
"Yes, it was June 1, because I remember
reading a story in that day's newspa-
per about the 8.0 earthquake in L.A.,
which destroyed most of downtown."
Paul's counsel objects to the reference
of the newspaper and makes a motion
to strike. The judge should:

A. Grant the motion, on the grounds
that the best evidence rule re-
quires production of the news-
paper.

B. Grant the motion, because the
reference to the newspaper story
does not fit within any exception
to the hearsay rule.

C. Deny the motion, on the grounds
that the court can take judicial
notice of the local newspaper.

D. Deny the motion, because a
witness may refer to a collateral
document without providing the

arising out of an automobile accident,
Benny, a bystander, was called to the
stand by Pamela's counsel, to testify
that Darren had driven through a red
light, which caused the collision. On
cross-examination, Benny is asked if
he has ever been convicted for false
pretenses, which Benny denies. The
prosecutor offers a certified copy of
the criminal conviction into evidence,
upon Benny's denial. Pamela's counsel
objects. The court should:

A. Overrule the objection, because
it bears on the witness' credibil-
ity.

B. Overrule the objection, because
it is evidence that Benny is not
telling the truth.

C. Sustain the objection, because it

is irrelevant.

D. Sustain the objection, because
the witness' character is not in
issue.

71. Myron was arrested and charged with
the rape of Patty. He claims he did not
rape Patty because she had consented to
his advances. At trial, Myron is prepared
to testify that he had engaged in sexual
intercourse with the victim on many
occasions during the previous month
before the rape allegedly occurred with
the victim's consent. Myron's testimony
is: 

Q

A. Admissible, as evidence of spe-
cific acts to show consent.

B. Admissible, as evidence of

habit.

C. Inadmissible character evi-

dence.

D. Inadmissible, because reputa-
tion or opinion evidence of past
sexual behavior of the victim is
not permitted.

72. On January 3 1993, Dick was prosecuted
for burglary. At trial, Dick testified on
his own behalf, denying that he commit-
ted the burglary. On cross-examination,
the prosecution asked Dick if in 1980 he
had been convicted of robbery. Dick's
attorney objects. The court should:

A. Overrule the objection, because
the prosecutor may test the cred-
ibility of the witness.

B. Overrule the objection, because
the testimony is immaterial.

C. Sustain the objection, because
the crime is more than 10 years
old.

D. Sustain the objection, because
the adverse party was not given
written notice.

73. Lovejoy sued Eric for injuries suffered
by him when Eric collided his motor-
cycle into Lovejoy. At trial, Lovejoy
offers into evidence a properly authen-
ticated letter from Eric which states,
"Your claim of damage seems too high,
but because I have no insurance, and I
was at fault, I'm prepared to pay the
amount in which you have asked." The
letter is:

A. Admissible, under public policy

reasons. 

B. Admissible, because it is a party

admission.

C. Inadmissible, because Eric's

statement is opinion.

D. Inadmissible, because the state-
ment was made during an effort
to settle a claim.

74. Bonnie was sued by Brent for the sale
of her shares in the Acme Corporation.
Bonnie consulted her friend Steve, an

for the sale to Steve, and disclosed the
financial condition of the corporation.
Steve determined that the transaction
was too complex and in violation of a

At trial, Brent calls Steve to testify to
the contents of the conversation be-

B. Sustain the objection, because
the conversation is not relevant
to the sale of the stock.

C. Overrule the objection, because
Steve was not retained by Bon-

75. Mr. Roper owns a house at 24211
Lemon Street. He rents the house to
Jack. The lease states that Jack will
maintain the house and yard in its pres-
ent condition. While walking home
one day, Chrissie was hit on the head
when a tree limb fell from Mr. Roper's
property, seriously injuring her. It is
agreed between the parties that the tree
fell because of dry rot. Mr. Roper hired
Larry the next day to have the whole
tree removed from the property. Chris-
sie now brings suit against Mr. Roper
in Superior Court. At trial, Mr. Roper
testifies that he rented out the house to
Jack, who he claims was responsible for
the maintenance of the yard, under the
terms of the lease. Chrissie introduces
into evidence that Mr. Roper had Larry
remove the tree from the property the

A. Admissible, because the evi-
dence is not being used to prove
negligence or culpable conduct.

B. Admissible, because Mr. Roper

was at fault.

C. Inadmissible, because Mr. Rop-
er's acts were subsequent reme-
dial measures.

D. Inadmissible, because the pro-
bative value substantially out-

76. Norm was employed at BeerCo as a
quality control tester of the "flip-top"
openers on 12-ounce beverage cans
produced by his employer for their
number one product, Cheers beer. One
day while at work, Norm was injured
when one of the "flip-tops" fell unno-
ticed into the can he was testing, only
to be swallowed by Norm on his next
sip of beer. Norm dies as a result.

Vera, Norm's wife, brings a wrong-
ful death action against BeerCo. At
trial, Vera's counsel seeks to introduce
BeerCo's offer to pay funeral expenses.
BeerCo objects. The court should:

A. Sustain the objection, since of-
fering to pay funeral expenses
is not admissible to prove liabil-
ity.

B. Sustain the objection, since the

offer is hearsay.

C. Overrule the objection, since
Beer Co's statement is a party
admission.

D. Overrule the objection, since
Beer Co's statement is a declara-
tion against their interest.

77. Botch was named as a criminal defen-
dant for allegedly killing the cashier at
a local convenience store. One of his
defenses is that he is innocent by reason
of a mental disease or defect such that
he could not appreciate the wrongful-
ness of his acts. The defense presented
expert testimony through Dr. Wright
who was properly qualified as an expert.
Dr. Wright testified that Botch suffered
a mental disease or defect at the time
of his acts, as to the characteristics of
that mental disease or defect, and his
diagnosis of Botch. The defense then
offered Dr. Wright's opinion that Botch
did not know his acts were wrong when
committed, over objection of the district
attorney. How will the court rule on the
prosecution's objection?

A. Overruled, because Dr. Wright
was properly qualified as an
expert before testifying.

B. Overruled, if Dr. Wright's expert
opinion that Botch suffered from
a mental disease or defect was
uncontroverted.

C. Sustained, because an expert
cannot testify on whether the
defendant had the mental condi-
tion constituting an element of a
defense to the crime charged.

D. Sustained, because Dr. Wright's
testimony was biased in favor of
Botch. 

EVIDENCE 335

79. Yvette's attorney called to the stand
Lou, a cashier at Sparkle Jewelry Store,
to testify as follows: two hours before
she was charged with shoplifting at
Nordstrom's, Yvette had shopped at
Sparkle Jewelry Store and, after paying
for a $2,000 diamond ring she had pur-
chased, walked out of the store leaving
the diamond ring on a store counter. The
prosecution objects to the testimony of
Stephanie. The court should:

A. Sustain the objection, because
the testimony pertains to an im-
permissible character trait.

B. Sustain the objection, because it
is improper opinion testimony.

C. Overrule the objection, because
Lou has first hand knowledge of
Yvette's conduct in the store on
the occasion in question.

D. Overrule the objection, because
Lou's testimony tends to dis-
prove Yvette's intent to com-
mit the crime of shoplifting at
Nordstrom's.

80. Yvette also calls Burt, a psychologist, to
testify that he had treated Yvette and, in
his opinion, Yvette was suffering from
a psychological condition which im-
paired her memory and caused her to be
forgetful. The prosecution objects to the
testimony of Burt. The court should: 

Questions 78 - 80 are based on the
following facts:

Yvette leaves Nordstrom without paying for
a blouse. She is stopped after exiting and is
charged with shoplifting. At trial, the pros-
ecution introduces into evidence that Yvette
exited from the department store without
paying for the blouse, which was found on
her baby stroller. Yvette testifies that she
walked out of the store with the blouse hang-
ing on the outside of her stroller and that she
forgot that she had placed it there while she
looked for a matching skirt.

78. Yvette's attorney calls Stephanie to
testify that Yvette forgot her baby son at
Nordstrom the last time she went shop-
ping, six months ago. The prosecution
objects to the testimony of Stephanie.
The court should:

A. Sustain the objection, because
the testimony pertains to an im-
permissible character trait.

B. Sustain the objection, because it

is improper opinion testimony.

C. Overrule the objection, because
Stephanie has personal knowl-
edge of Yvette's character.

D. Overrule the objection, because
it tends to disprove Yvette's in-
tent to commit the crime.

336 EVIDENCE

A. Sustain the objection, because
the testimony pertains to an im-
permissible character trait.

B. Sustain the objection, because it
is improper opinion testimony.

C. Overrule the objection, if Burt is

a qualified expert.

D. Overrule the objection, because
Burt's testimony is consistent
with a finding of innocence.

81. Deft is charged with the sale of heroin.
He denies making the alleged sale. Deft
calls Fred, his friend, who testifies that
for six years he has known Deft socially
and has lived in the same neighborhood.
Deft then asks Fred whether Deft has
a character trait for non-violence. The
prosecution objects. The court should:

A. Sustain the objection, because
the testimony is impermissible
character evidence.

B. Sustain the objection, because
the evidence of the character trait
of non-violence is irrelevant to
the issue of selling narcotics.

C. Overrule the objection, because
the testimony is permissible
character evidence.

D. Overrule the objection, because
once character evidence is ad-
mitted into evidence, the door
is opened for further character
evidence.

82. Mark is charged with murder. He pleads
not guilty. At the request of Mark's
lawyer, the trial judge appoints Doctors
Art and Cathy, psychiatrists, to examine
Mark and advise Mark's lawyer as to
whether Mark should rely upon the de-
fense of mental defect. At trial, Mark's
defense is diminished capacity. Mark's
lawyer calls Dr. Art, who gives an
opinion in support of Mark's defense.
Mark's lawyer rests her case. In rebut-
tal, the prosecution calls Dr. Cathy, to
give an opinion contrary to that of Dr.
Art. Mark's lawyer objects. The court
should:

A. Sustain the objection, because of
the attorney-client privilege.

B. Sustain the objection, because
of the psychiatrist-patient privi-
lege.

C. Overrule the objection, because
as Mark's expert medical provid-
er, she is not permitted to testify
adverse to Mark's interest.

D. Overrule the objection, because
Dr. Cathy was never listed as
the prosecution's expert prior to
trial.

Dave has not testified.

85. Lucy sued Fred for injuries suffered by
her when Fred collided his blue truck
into her MG. At trial, Lucy calls Ricky
to the stand. Ricky testifies that he was
driving the MG when the accident hap-
pened. He further testified that when he
pulled onto the tollway, Lucy said to
him, "Watch out for that blue truck - it
looks like the driver has been drinking,
and he can't seem to keep control over
his car." Fred's counsel objects. The
testimony is:

A. Admissible, for public policy

reasons.

B. Admissible, as a present sense

impression.

C. Inadmissible, as hearsay.

D. Inadmissible, as improper lay

opinion.

A. Admissible, because it tends to

prove Deft's plan.

B. Admissible, because it is a mate-

D. Inadmissible, because its pro-
bative value is substantially

84. Polly sues Dave for damages arising
out of an automobile accident. Polly
claims that Dave was negligent. At trial,
Polly calls Tim to the stand. Tim testi-
fies that he is a member of the church
which Dave attends, and that Dave
has a reputation for being a "careless"
driver. Dave's attorney objects to the
testimony. The trial court should:

A. Allow the testimony, because it

is trustworthy.

B. Allow the testimony, because it
is relevant to the issue of whether
Dave was negligent.

In an action by Thelma against Petro
Corp., evidence of Maybel's statement
is:

A. Inadmissible, because it was
not authorized by Axelrod's
employer.

B. Inadmissible, because Maybel
was not under a state of excite-

unfair prejudice.

B. Admit the tape, because it is a

Questions 88 - 89 are based on the
following facts:

While driving home from work, Betty Grav-
el ran her rock-mobile into Fred Stone. Fred
was seriously injured. Fred sued Betty for the
injuries he received in the auto accident. Fred
claims that Betty was negligent because she
was driving over the speed limit.

At trial, Fred calls Wilma Granite to testify.
Wilma saw the accident from the street cor-
ner and testifies that Betty was wearing a
pink polka dot jumpsuit at the time of the ac-
cident. Betty calls Barney Pumice to testify
that Betty was wearing a green dress.

88. Barney's testimony is:

A. Admissible, because it is relevant
to the issue of who was negli-
gent.

B. Admissible, because it tends to
test the credibility of the wit-
ness.

C. Inadmissible, because it is ex-
trinsic evidence on a collateral
matter.

D. Inadmissible, because it is irrel-

evant.

89. Betty testified in her own behalf that she
was going 25 m.p.h. On cross-exami-
nation, Dino Sawyer (Fred's attorney),
did not question Betty in regard to her
speed. Dino called Officer BamBam to
testify that in his investigation of the
accident, Betty told him that she was
traveling 40 m.p.h. Officer BamBam's
testimony is:

A. Admissible, as a declaration

against interest.

B. Admissible, because it is not

hearsay.

C. Inadmissible, because it is hear-
say not within any exception.

D. Inadmissible, because it lacks

foundation.

90. While driving home from work, George
stopped at Harry's Bar for a drink. After
having a few drinks, George asked Joe,
the bartender, for another. Joe, worried
about George's intoxicated state, told
George that he had already had enough
to drink. George then became very an-
gry, and said to Joe, "Get me a drink or
else." Joe again refused. 

340 EVIDENCE

Angered by Joe's response, George
jumped off his bar stool and hit Joe.
Joe now brings suit against George to
recover for his injuries. At trial, Joe's
attorney put Joe on the stand. Joe's pro-
posed testimony is that George stated to
him, "Get me a drink or else." George's
attorney objects to the testimony. The
court should:

A. Overrule the objection, because

it is not hearsay.

B. Overrule the objection, because
it is probative of the declarant's
state of mind.

C. Sustain the objection, because it
is hearsay not within any excep-

D. Sustain the objection, because
George could not form the intent
to commit a battery while intoxi-

91. While out on patrol, Officer Speedtrapp
pulled over Burt in his new black Trans
Am for speeding. He issued Burt a
speeding ticket. After laying a founda-
tion for admitting the radar reading,
Speedtrapp testifies that he was stopped
at the corner of 5th and Golden and
pointed his radar gun at Burt. The
gun rated Burt's speed to be 45 m.p.h.
Burt's attorney objects to the testimony.
The trial court should:

A. Not allow the testimony, because
the evidentiary foundation was
insufficient to establish all ele-
ments of a speeding violation.

B. Not allow the testimony, because

it is hearsay.

C. Allow the testimony, because
radar readings are an exception
to the hearsay rule.

D. Allow the testimony, because it

a Rolls Royce that Jim sold to her was
really a Bentley. In order to prove the
Rolls Royce was genuine, Jim intro-
duces the bill of sale he received at a
car auction when he purchased the car.
Tami's counsel objects. The bill of sale
is:

A. Admissible, because documents
of title are conclusive of rightful
ownership.

B. Admissible, because it is a party

admission.

C. Inadmissible, because it is hear-

affectionate marital relationship during
their entire marriage. In defense, Shir-
ley seeks to introduce evidence of the
fact that from 1981 to 1983, Squiggy
separated from Laverne and lived with
another woman. Laverne objects. The

The couple fell in love, were married, and
started a musical career together. However,
Mike has a serious drug problem, and as a
result, he frequently becomes enraged when
when he was unable to come up with lyrics
to a new song, he "blind-sided" Thomas with
his fist. Thomas was seriously injured, but
never knew what hit him. Teena was the only
witness to the incident. The prosecutor files
battery charges against Mike and wants to
have Teena testify at trial as the only witness
to the incident. Teena objects because of her
fears it will ruin their careers.

disguise, who began wearing disguises
to engage in criminal activity as the
result of a large disfiguring scar on
his left cheek that was caused when
he once narrowly escaped capture by
Holmes.

the statement was a confidential
communication.

B. Admit the evidence, because the
testimonial privilege terminates

C. Admit the evidence, because the
marital privilege is inapplicable

as a criminal defense attorney, after
he finds out that Holmes is in trouble
with the law. Holmes is stopped for a
traffic violation and is found to have
cocaine in his possession. When he
visits Moriarty's "law" office, Holmes
admits to Moriarty that he possessed the
cocaine for his personal use on the date
in question. It is unknown to Holmes
that Moriarty is not an attorney.

After the visit, Holmes does not hire
Moriarty to represent him. Armed with
Holmes' confession, Moriarty calls the
district attorney and "cuts a deal" in
exchange for evidence of Holmes' guilt.
The prosecutor seeks to have Moriarty
testify at Holmes' drug possession trial.
Holmes' attorney objects. The testi-

calls Mr. Clean, the store janitor, to the
stand. Mr. Clean testifies that he regu-
larly sweeps the floor every half hour
and that he never leaves anything on the
floor. He further testifies that if there
had been anything on the floor when
he swept, including a piece of candy,
he would have seen it. Bert's attorney
objects to Mr. Clean's testimony. The
court should:

A. Admit the testimony, because it is

relevant.

B. Admit the testimony, because it is

proper habit evidence.

C. Exclude the testimony, as specula-

tive.

D. Exclude the testimony, as preju-

dicial.

EVIDENCE ANSWERS

1. A is the correct answer. If a proper foun-
dation is laid, the photograph is admis-
sible into evidence. This requires that
there be someone who can testify that
the photograph is a true and accurate
representation of the accident scene.
Since anyone who was present at the
scene when the photograph was taken
can testify to the accuracy of the photo-
graph, the photographer does not have
to be present. B is incorrect because the
burden is on Petunia, not Daisy, to lay
the foundation showing that the photo-
graph is a true and accurate representa-
tion of the accident scene. C is incorrect
because the photographer does not have
to be present. D is incorrect because the
photo could be taken by anyone; it does
not have to be an investigative agent.

2. B is the correct answer. Mistress may in-
troduce evidence of her good character
to show that she is not the type of person
likely to murder Wife. A is incorrect
because Mistress has not taken the stand
and put her credibility into issue. C is
incorrect because, at this point, Mistress
is not trying to prove her character for
truthfulness. D is legally incorrect be-
cause reputation is a permissible way
to prove character.

3. D is the correct answer. A declarant's
statement as to her present state of mind
is admissible, if it tends to establish the
declarant's state of mind or intent to
do something in some future time. A is
incorrect because the statement is hear-
say, but is admissible under the present
mental state exception. B is incorrect
because the defendant's mental state
is certainly probative, i.e., relevant - it
may establish her alibi. C is incorrect
because the statement is hearsay. It is
an out-of-court statement going to the
truth of the matter asserted, i.e., it is
a direct assertion of Mistress' state of
mind — her intent to visit her relatives
— offered to prove that Mistress had
that intent to show that Mistress acted
on her intent (i.e., that she, in fact, vis-
ited her relatives in another state.) This
is the "Hillmon" use of the state of mind
exception to the hearsay rule.

4. C is the correct answer. Questions which
point to possible prejudice or bias are
always relevant. A is incorrect, since,
as a matter of law, bias and prejudice
do not go beyond the scope of direct
examination. B is incorrect because
the credibility of a testifying witness is
always a consequential (i.e., provable)
proposition. D is incorrect because it is
an incorrect statement of law.

EVIDENCE  351        

5. B is the correct answer. Although there
is nothing wrong with the prosecutor's
question, the prejudicial effect on the
jury may be great. Therefore, the judge
has the discretion to decide that the
probative value is substantially out-
weighed by the potential prejudice. A
is incorrect because a question tending
to prove bias is never beyond the scope
of direct examination. C is incorrect
because leading questions are permitted
on cross-examination. D is incorrect, as
it is an incorrect statement of law.

6. D is the correct answer. The general rule
is that other crimes or wrongs are not
admissible to prove a person's character
(i.e., propensity to act a certain way)
to show action that the person acted
in conformity with his character (i.e.,
propensity). However, other crimes,
wrongs or acts are admissible for a
non-character purpose, i.e., to show
identity (by modus operandi). That is,
other crimes are admissible only if, as
here, the hand-gun used by Sam in the
prior robbery against Pete is so unique
that it tends to establish the identity of
Sam as the one who robbed Joe. Here,
Sam's use of a psychedlic-painted gun
to rob Pete is a "signature" crime. The
psychedelic-painted gun is unique
enough to be relevant, in a non-char-
acter way, to establish Sam's modus
operandi. A is incorrect because, in this
fact pattern, Sam's character is not "in
issue". B is incorrect because, although
the evidence may be prejudicial, the risk
of causing unfair prejudice to Sam (by
showing his propensity to rob) does not
substantially outweigh the evidence's
strong probative value (to show Sam's
identity through M.O.). C is incorrect
because mere possession of the gun
would not show Sam is capable of
armed robbery.

352 EVIDENCE

7. B is the correct answer. Under the
Federal Rules of Evidence [hereinaf-
ter F.R.E.1, Rule 803(1), there is an
exception to the hearsay rule for pres-
ent sense impressions. Since Wilma
made a statement about a condition
she observed while she was observing
it, this would qualify the statement as a
present-sense impression. A is incorrect
because the excited utterance exception
requires that the statement was made
under the stress of an exciting event.
This is not the case, under these facts.
C is incorrect because a prior consistent
statement is used to rebut a charge of
recent fabrication. Wilma's credibility
as a witness has not been attacked (i.e.,
impeached) as a recent fabrication. D is
incorrect since the state of drunkenness
is the type of subject a lay person may
give an opinion on.

8. D is the correct answer. The F.R.E. al-
low a prior inconsistent statement to
be used for impeachment purposes as
well as substantive evidence of the fact
in question, if the statement was made
under oath, at a proceeding (including
a deposition), and the declarant is avail-
able to testify concerning the statement.
A is incorrect because, under the F.R.E.,
one may impeach his own witness. B is
incorrect because a prior inconsistent
statement, under oath, is not hearsay.
C is incorrect because it is not the best
answer. Although it can be used to
refresh Pete's memory, the better use
here would be to impeach and can also
be used as substantive evidence. There-
fore, D is the better answer under the
facts.

9. D is the correct answer. F.R.E. 407 ex-
cludes evidence of subsequent remedial
measures. The rationale falls under
public policy; if such evidence could
be used to establish the prior existence
of a dangerous condition or practice,
the person liable would be reluctant
to take corrective action. A, B and C
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer D.

EVIDENCE

353

10. B is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
409, evidence that a party has offered
to pay medical expenses is not admis-
sible to prove liability. However, any
admission of fact made in connection
therewith is admissible. A is incorrect
because, under an offer to compromise
accompanying the admission, it would
most likely be inadmissible. C is in-
correct because an admission made by
a party is an exception to the hearsay
rule. D is incorrect under F.R.E. 409,
admissions of fact accompanying the
offer are admissible.

11. C is the correct answer. For the physi-
cian-patient privilege to attach, the
information obtained from the patient
must be necessary to enable the physi-
cian to treat the patient. Here, Angelo's
statements to the doctor do not relate to
treatment and, thus, are not protected
by the privilege. A is incorrect for the
reasons stated in correct answer C. B
is an incorrect statement of law. Confi-
dentiality, which is an essential element
to the formation of the privilege, would
not be impaired by the fact that the ad-
mitting nurse overheard Angelo's com-
munication to the doctor. D is incorrect
because, whether Angelo intended this
statement to be confidential or not
would not, the privilege did not "form"
for the reasons stated in answer A.

12. B is the best answer. Under F.R.E.
901, a letter must be authenticated be-
fore it will be admitted into evidence.
F.R.E. 901(a) states, "the requirement
of authentication or identification as a
condition precedent to admissibility is
satisfied by evidence sufficient to sup-
port a finding that the matter in ques-
tion is what the proponent claims." A
is an incorrect statement of law - there
is not an absolute rule that the Court
receive the original document. C is an
incorrect answer, as the issue here is
authentication. D is incorrect because,
under the F.R.E., the letter need not be
authenticated by an expert.

13. B is the correct answer. Attorney-cli-
ent communications remain privileged
even when made in the presence of joint
clients or others, if the others are "rea-
sonably necessary" to the consultation.
A is incorrect because the testimony
is not offered to prove the contents of
Sneak's notes - thus, the best evidence
rule is inapplicable. C is incorrect be-
cause the other persons present were
reasonably necessary to the consulta-
tion. Thus, the privilege attaches. D is
incorrect because Ace and Owner are
joint clients, and the attorney-client
privilege would attach. 

354 EVIDENCE

14. A is the correct answer. A business re-
port prepared as a communication from
client to attorney is privileged. B and C
are incorrect because even though a re-
port contains hearsay or is self-serving,
it does not prevent its discovery by the
opponent. D is incorrect for the reasons
supporting answer A.

15. A is the correct answer. F.R.E. 803(1)
holds that a present sense impression
and excited utterance are not excluded
by the hearsay rule, even though the
declarant is available as a witness. A
present sense impression is a statement
describing or explaining an event or
condition made while the declarant
was perceiving the event or condition,
or immediately thereafter. Thus, Ella's
statement would qualify. B is incor-
rect because the declarant, Ella, does
not have to be unavailable. C is incor-
rect because although the statement is
hearsay, it falls within the present sense
impression exception. D is an incorrect
statement of law. Although Ella is not a
legal adult (18 years of age), she is still
able to perceive and communicate.

16. C is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
404(b), evidence of other crimes,
wrongs, or acts is not admissible to
prove the character of a person in order
to show that he acted in conformity
therewith. However, it may be admis-
sible for other purposes, such as proof
of intent, motive, preparation, opportu-
nity, knowledge, plan, scheme or iden-
tity. Under these facts, this evidence
may be used to show Deft's intent as
well as common scheme or plan. A is
incorrect, as it is an incorrect statement
of law. This evidence is very relevant
to the charges against Deft. Both B and
D are incorrect since they miss the key
legal issue of utilizing the evidence to
show intent.

17. A is the correct answer. Because there
was self-identification and a phone
book, the voice would be considered
properly identified. B is incorrect be-
cause the accuracy of a telephone book
is not an easily verifiable fact. C is in-
correct because Farmer does not have
to be familiar with Rancher's voice for
authentication. D is an incorrect state-
ment of law.

EVIDENCE

355

18. C is the correct answer. The general
rule is that in a civil case, evidence of
character to prove probable conduct is
inadmissible. A is incorrect because of
the reasoning stated in correct answer
C. B is incorrect because reputation
testimony is not "habit" evidence. Also,
being a "dare devil" rider is too general
to be classified as "habit". Habit is a
specific and unvarying response to a
specific situation. D is incorrect because
this answer states the rule for criminal
cases, not civil.

19. A is the correct answer. Porter's testi-
mony is relevant in two ways: first, it
is substantive evidence that tends to es-
tablish a consequential proposition, i.e.,
that David, in fact, ran the red light and,
second, it impeaches Witt's testimony
by contradicting him (i.e., by showing
that Witt's testimony — that David's car
did not run the red light — was false). B
is not correct because the mere fact that
Porter was surprised does not give him
the right to impeach. C and D are both
incorrect. Under F.R.E. 607, any wit-
ness may be impeached by any party.

20. B is the correct answer. The question as
to whether Valor was high 18 months
prior to the accident is collateral to the
issue of whether David ran the red light.
A witness may not be impeached on a
matter not directly relevant to the issues
in the case. A is incorrect because the
F.R.E. allow for the impeachment by
specific acts of conduct. C is incorrect
because Valor's use of marijuana is not
logically relevant to show that Valor has
an untruthful character. D is incorrect
because Sam's use of marijuana 18
months prior to the event to which he
testified in court is not logically relevant
to show an impaired memory of that
event.

21. D is the correct answer. Although the
statement is hearsay, F.R.E. 803(2)
allows a statement relating to a star-
tling event or condition made while
the declarant was under the stress of
excitement caused by the event or
condition. This is known as the excited
utterance exception. A is incorrect be-
cause although the statement preceded
the accident, it was still made relating
to a startling event, allowing for the
F.R.E. exception. B is incorrect because
unavailability is not a requirement. C is
incorrect because although it is hearsay,
it falls within an exception. 

356 EVIDENCE

22. B is the correct answer. Here, Driver's
failure to deny Polly's statement may
constitute an admission by silence. A
is an incorrect statement of law. C is
incorrect because no facts support it.
D is incorrect because no foundation
is required for an admission.

23. C is the correct answer. Although the
statement is hearsay, it is admissible
under the F.R.E., which allow for the
statement of the declarant describing
his own physical sensation or condition.
A is incorrect because self-serving evi-
dence may be admissible. B is incorrect
because it falls within the F.R.E. 803(3)
exception for physical condition. D is
incorrect because only an expert could
testify to whether the hip was fractured
or not.

24. A is the correct answer. Settlement of-
fers, although they may be relevant, are
inadmissible. This policy is to encour-
age settlement negotiations. B, C and
D are incorrect for the reasons stated
in answer A.

25. B is the correct answer. Under the doc-
trine of present recollection refreshed, a
witness may be shown anything which
may reasonably refresh the recollection.
A is incorrect because past recollection
recorded introduces the contents of a
writing into evidence and requires the
laying of a foundation. C is incorrect
because the time lapse factor here is
not enough to prevent use of the letter.
D is incorrect because evidence may
not be excluded merely because it is
self-serving.

26. B is the correct answer. Whenever a
party's character is at issue under the
pleading, character evidence is fully
admissible. In this case, character is
an ultimate fact in dispute, and it must
be proved by competent evidence. Al-
though A is legally correct, it is not the
best answer because the more relevant
inquiry is whether evidence of character
is available in the case-in-chief. C is
incorrect because the statement is not
hearsay. Officer Smith is testifying di-
rectly. D is incorrect because character
is directly at issue in a defamation case,
i.e., such is highly probative. 

EVIDENCE 357

27. C is the correct answer. A communica-
tion made during marriage is privileged,
even after the marriage has ended.
Either spouse may assert the privilege,
to bar the other from testifying. A is
incorrect for the same reasons that C
is correct. B is incorrect because the
marital privilege may be asserted in
both civil and criminal proceedings. D
is incorrect because "spite" has noth-
ing to do with whether Felicia will be
allowed to testify or not.

28. D is the correct answer. A is incorrect
because the color of the jacket is not of
consequence to the action. B is incor-
rect because Wally's testimony is not
relevant to show Wally's untruthful
character. Wally's is relevant to contra-
dict Wally on the color of Shove's jacket
which tends to undermine Wally's cred-
ibility as a witness by casting doubt
on how attentive he was in observing
the event in question. However, the
color of Shove's jacket is a collateral
matter because its only relevance is to
contradict Wally. Extrinsic evidence is
inadmissible to impeach a witness on a
collateral matter. C is incorrect because
Walt's capacity to observe is a relevant
issue.

358 EVIDENCE

29. D is the correct answer. An admission
is an out-of-court statement made by a
party which is offered at trial against
that party by the opposing party. A
is incorrect because an admission is
not inadmissible hearsay, under the
F.R.E. B is incorrect as no foundation
is required. C is incorrect because an
admission is admissible whether or not
it discredits prior testimony.

30. A is the correct answer. The accused in
a criminal case may always offer evi-
dence of her good character to show that
she was unlikely to commit the crime
charged. B is an incorrect statement of
law. C is incorrect because Hilda does
not have to take the stand for Lionel's
testimony to be admissible. D is incor-
rect for the reasons A is the correct
answer.

31. A is the correct answer. The doctor-pa-
tient privilege protects any communica-
tion that was intended to be confidential
and was made for the purpose of medi-
cal diagnosis and treatment. This privi-
lege protects any information obtained
by verbal statements, examination,
and any diagnosis and treatment. The
patient is the holder of the privilege, but
if the patient is not present at trial, the
Doctor is ethically obligated to assert
the privilege on the patient's behalf.
The facts state that Dr. Perry was called
in to testify as a defense witness in the
case Jones v. Smith, and since Loll is
not present, Dr. Perry must assert the
privilege. B, C and D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in answer A.

32. C is the correct answer. As a general
rule, expert testimony is usually im-
proper when the jurors are competent
to draw their own conclusions on the
issue. Negligence for failing to file
within the statute of limitations in this
example is a conclusion which jurors
are competent to draw from the facts
presented at trial. A and B are incorrect
for the reason stated in correct answer
C. D is an incorrect statement of law
because the judge is not allowed, in
a jury case, to resolve the issue of the
existence of negligence in the action
before her.

33. A is the correct answer. Client must
prove that "but for" the lawyers' neg-
ligence she would have recovered. B,
C and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in answer A.

34. D is the best answer. Since the facts
state that the hallway had been waxed
approximately one hour before the ac-
cident, there was no substantial identity
of material circumstances between the
freshly waxed condition of the floor,
and the floor which was used by 11,000
other people without incident over the
prior one-week period. A and B are
incorrect for the reasons stated in the
correct answer D. C is incorrect be-
cause evidence of the absence of prior
accidents to show the nonexistence of
a dangerous condition or causation is
subject to the "substantial similarity"
requirement. Under the stated facts,
the hallway floor had just been waxed
an hour before Paul walked on it. Willy
did not lay a foundation showing that
the floor was in substantially similar
condition (i.e., excessively waxed) the
previous week when the 11,000 people
walked on it. Because the substantial
similarity requirement was not met, D
is the best answer.

35. A is the correct answer. There is no rule
which disqualifies a person with mental
illness or defect from testifying. The
test of competency is not insanity, but
only whether a witness can appreci-
ate the obligation to tell the truth and
have sufficient ability to perceive and
communicate perceptions. B, C and D
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer A.

EVIDENCE 359

40. A is the correct answer. In a criminal
case the court shall instruct the jury
that it may, but is not required to, ac-
cept as conclusive any fact judicially
noticed. By the judge taking judicial
notice, such merely allowed the jury to
accept the fact as true, or not, that Birdie
drove across state lines (an element in
the crime charged). B is an incorrect
statement of law. C is incorrect for the
reasons stated in correct answer A. D
is incorrect because this is a criminal
case.

41. D is the correct answer because Abel's
committing the hoax on the church is a
specific act of misconduct which may
not be proven by extrinsic evidence.
Therefore, his purported testimony is
inadmissible pursuant to F.R.E. 608. A,
B, and C are incorrect for the reasons
stated in answer D.

42. B is the correct answer. If a witness'
testimony concerning a crime could
lead to a criminal conviction, the privi-
lege against self-incrimination can be
claimed. However, in a criminal case,
after direct examination of a witness,
the direct testimony can be stricken
if the witness invokes the privilege so
that a defendant is not denied his con-
stitutional right to confrontation. A is
incorrect because there need not be a
charge pending, in order to invoke the
privilege. C and D are incorrect for the
identical reasons stated in answer B.

36. D is the correct answer. F.R.E. 408 pro-
vides that any evidence that one of the
parties offered to settle or compromise
the claim against another is inadmis-
sible to show liability. A, B and C are
incorrect for the reasons stated in the
answer D.

37. C is the correct answer. The placing
of a speed governor on the truck is a
subsequent remedial repair. F.R.E. 407
prohibits evidence of subsequent repairs
to prove negligence, culpable conduct,
or product defect because public policy
favors making such repairs. A, B and D
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer C.

38. A is the correct answer. A statement
made by a party's agent or employee
concerning a matter within the scope
of his agency or employment may be
offered against the party. Under the
F.R.E., no authority to speak is required.
C is incorrect because an admission
does not require proof of unavailability
to be admissible. B and D are incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer A.

39. A is the correct answer. Jamie's state-
ment to Officer is a party admission.
Under the F.R.E., an admission is ex-
empted from the hearsay rule. B, C and
D are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer A.

360 EVIDENCE

43. A is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
609, evidence of being convicted of a
crime shall be admitted, if the crime was
punishable by death or imprisonment
in excess of one year, if the accused is
the witness, and if its probative value
outweighs the prejudicial effect to the
defendant. B is an incorrect statement of
law. C is incorrect because the question
deals with impeachment. D is incorrect
because F.R.E. 609 provides notice
must be given for crimes more than ten
years old. Here, the crime took place
exactly ten years ago; thus, requiring
no notice.

44. B is the correct answer. The affidavit
is being offered in evidence to prove
Jack's incompetency (i.e., offered for
the truth), and is an out-of-court state-
ment by the declarant, Henry. The af-
fidavit is inadmissible hearsay, unless
there is an exception. Based upon the
facts, there is no exception that will ap-
ply. A is incorrect because lay opinion
as to common perceptions is permitted.
C and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in answer B.

45. D is the correct answer because a
criminal defendant, after being read his
Miranda rights, has a right to remain
silent. Although an adoptive admission
by silence can generally be used against
a party who manifested his adoption or
belief in its truth by conduct or silence,
here it cannot, since Neal is exercising a
constitutional right. A, B and C are in-
correct for the reasons stated in answer
D.

46. A is the correct answer because Loaden
received the invoice from the shipping
clerk as part of his regular-conducted
business responsibilities. His testimony
merely authenticated the invoice and is
sufficient to lay a foundation in order
to allow the shipping invoice into evi-
dence. B is incorrect because Loaden
had no personal knowledge of the
merchandise listed upon the invoice.
C is incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer A. D is incorrect because the
invoice qualifies as a business record,
an exception to the hearsay rule.

47. C is the correct answer. Hearsay is an
out-of-court statement offered to prove
the truth of the matter asserted. Here,
the statement is offered to prove that
Ginger hit James. A is incorrect because
a present sense impression is a state-
ment describing or explaining an event
or condition made at the time of the
event or immediately thereafter. A ten-
minute time lapse between the accident
and the statement made, allows time for
fabrication. Thus, the statement is not
trustworthy and does not qualify as a
present sense impression. B is incorrect
for the reason stated in answer C. D is
an incorrect statement of law. 

EVIDENCE 361

49. D is the best answer by a process of
elimination. There is no applicable
rule that renders Raymond's testimony
inadmissible. "Absence of complaint"
to prove that a condition did not exist
is not hearsay. A is incorrect because
there are no facts to indicate Raymond's
statement is reliable. Raymond, as a
plaintiff-witness, is biased. Further-
more, A is not based on any applicable
legal principle. B is incorrect because
Raymond did not testify to his opinion,
but simply that, as a matter of fact, he
never complained of knee pain before
his fall. C is incorrect for the same rea-
son that B is incorrect. 

48. A is the best answer. Pursuant to F.R.E.
803(3) (and California Evidence Code
1250), a person's statement concerning
his then-existing physical condition is
admissible when the declarant's physi-
cal condition at a specified time is at
issue and the statement relates to the
time his condition is at issue. Although
Raymond is claiming permanent in-
juries resulting from the incident, he
was observed swimming in the hotel
pool later in the same day. Because
these facts raise an issue of whether
Raymond suffered injuries as a result
of the incident, his statement of physi-
cal complaint to Jean Paul immediately
after his fall is admissible as evidence
that he was, in fact, injured. B is incor-
rect because it does not provide a suf-
ficient basis for admitting Raymond's
statement. C is incorrect because there
is no requirement that the declarant's
statement be made to a treating doctor.
D is incorrect because Raymond, as a
lay person, is permitted to describe his
own condition concerning knee pain.

362 EVIDENCE

51. B is the best answer. F.R.E. 409 provides
that evidence of furnishing, offering or
promising to pay medical, hospital or
similar expenses for an injury is not ad-
missible to prove liability for the injury.
However, an admission is admissible
when made in connection with an offer
or promise to pay medical or hospital
expenses, although the offer or promise
is inadmissible. A, C and D are incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer B. 

50. B is the correct answer. Although
Raymond's statement to Dr. Cure is
hearsay, if offered to prove the truth
of Raymond's assertion, i.e., that he
suffered knee pain after helping a col-
lege buddy move, the statement is ad-
missible hearsay under F.R.E. 803(4).
Under this rule, a statement made for
the purpose of medical diagnosis or
treatment and describing medical his-
tory, or past or present symptoms, pain
or sensations, or the inception or gen-
eral character of the cause or external
source thereof insofar as reasonably
pertinent to diagnosis or treatment, is
admissible. A is incorrect because it
does not address the hearsay issue. C is
incorrect because Raymond's statement
to his physician is not covered by the
physician-patient privilege. The physi-
cian-patient privilege, under California
Evidence Code 994, grants a privilege
to a patient to refuse to disclose, and to
prevent his physician from disclosing,
any confidential information obtained
by his physician while attending the
patient. However, under the "patient-
litigant exception," the privilege cannot
be claimed in a personal injury lawsuit
where the patient relies on a physical
condition as an element of his claim
or defense. D is incorrect because B is
correct.

EVIDENCE 363

52. C is the best answer. Stan only testi-
fied to part of Don's statement to Paul,
leaving out the remainder of the state-
ment pertaining to the accident which
diminishes the force of Don's apparent
admission of fault. On cross-examina-
tion, Don's attorney seeks to elicit from
Stan the remainder of Don's statement
pertaining to the cause of the accident,
in order to give the trier of fact a more
accurate understanding of what Don
said to Paul about the cause of the ac-
cident. A judge might rule that Paul has
"opened the door" to the remainder of
Don's statement to Paul. A is incorrect
because it assumes facts not contained
in the fact pattern (i.e., that there was
a police report) and, furthermore, the
best evidence rule is inapplicable here
because Stan's testimony is not being
offered to prove the contents of a writ-
ing (Stan testified to what he overheard
Don say to Paul). B is incorrect because
Don's attorney is not offering Don's of-
fer to pay Paul's medical bills in order
to prove Don's fault. Under F.R.E. 409,
evidence of offering to pay medical ex-
penses is inadmissible only when used
to prove liability for the injury. D is
not the best answer because it states an
incorrect legal principle. By process of
elimination, C is the best answer.

53. C is the best answer. Under F.R.E.
803(1), a declarant's statement describ-
ing or explaining an event or condition
made while the declarant was perceiving
the event or condition, or immediately
thereafter, is an exception to the hear-
say rule. Marie's statement concerning
Larry's failure to stop for the red light
described the incident. Because Marie
was conscious for only a few moments
after the accident, her statement was
necessarily made immediately after the
accident occurred. Therefore, Marie's
statement is a present sense impression.
A, B and D are incorrect for the reasons
explaining answer C.

54. B is the best answer. Deputy Fife is
merely testifying in regard to his ob-
servations of Pete's appearance when
he was arrested. Fife's testimony was
not admissible as a prior identification
because admissibility on such grounds
requires the witness to make a statement
of identification prior to trial which did
not occur in these facts. A, C and D are
incorrect for the reasons stated in the
answer B.

364 EVIDENCE

55. C is the correct answer. The attorney-
client privilege protects those com-
munications which the client either
expressly made confidential or would
reasonably be assumed, under the
circumstances, to be confidential. In
the case where a lawyer has a clerk or
secretary present, the privilege is still in
effect, even if the client does not retain
that attorney. A and B are incorrect for
the reasons stated in answer C. D is an
incorrect statement.

56. A is the correct answer. Under the F.R.E.
and California Evidence rules, a prior
inconsistent statement in a deposition
may be used as substantive evidence.
Comment to F.R.E. 613(b) says that,
although foundation must be laid for
extrinsic proof of a prior inconsistent
statement, the witness does not have to
be shown the prior inconsistent state-
ment before introducing the intrinsic
evidence, as long as the witness, at
some time during trial, has the op-
portunity to explain. B is incorrect
because unavailability to testify is not
a requirement under the rule stated in
A. C is incorrect for the reasons stated
for A. D is incorrect because intentional
untruthfulness is not a requirement for
admissibility of deposition testimony
under the rule stated in A.

57. C is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
405, character or trait of character of a
person, if an essential element of a claim
or essential to the case of the defense,
may be proven by specific instances of
conduct. Bud sued Troy for negligently
allowing Don to use his car ("negligent
entrustment").Don's propensity to drive
carelessly is an element of the cause
of action for negligent entrustment. A,
B and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in answer C.

58. C is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
405(a), "in all cases in which evidence
of character is admissible (including
where character is an element of a claim
or defense), proof may be made by tes-
timony as to reputation or by testimony
in the form of an opinion." A is incor-
rect because habit refers to a routine,
activity, or response frequently repeated
over a protracted period of time. B is
incorrect because reputation evidence
of character, although hearsay to prove
the character trait, is admissible under
F.R.E. 803(21) which creates a hearsay
exception for reputation as to character.
D is incorrect because Don's reputa-
tion as a careful driver is not relevant
to prove bias. 

EVIDENCE 365

59. C is the best answer. The statement is
not hearsay because it is being used to
circumstantially show Sally's knowl-
edge that Brian was in fact still alive
when he was shot. A and B are incorrect
because the statement was not hearsay
- it was not being used to prove whether
Brian "was going to die." D is incorrect
because firsthand knowledge is not the
test as to whether a particular statement
is hearsay or not.

60. A is the best answer. The Best Evidence
Rule requires the painting, which can be
easily produced, to be introduced into
evidence to show whether the scene
portrayed is libelous or not, a key is-
sue in the case. B is incorrect because
Witness testified that she observed Ben
hanging the painting she described. C
is incorrect because there are no facts
indicating that Witness is competent to
testify whether or not it was Marie's
signature on the painting. D is incorrect
for the reasons stated for answer A.

61. B is the correct answer because the tes-
timony of Paul proves the earnings of
the partnership in which he has personal
knowledge, and is relevant. A is incor-
rect because it is immaterial whether
the books can be inspected to decide
whether Paul's testimony is permissible
or not. C is incorrect because Paul is tes-
tifying to facts in which he has personal
knowledge, not to the contents of the
books. D is incorrect because Paul is not
testifying to the contents of a writing.

366 EVIDENCE

62. A is the correct answer. Where facts
are attempted to be shown through
written records, the best evidence rule
generally applies because the contents
of the writing are then being proved.
However, a qualified expert may testify
as to summaries of complex records,
even though the records themselves are
not introduced. The only requirement
attached to the admissibility of Alvin's
testimony, is that the original books be
available for inspection by the adver-
sary. Here, the books are available for
inspection. B, C and D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in answer A.

63. D is the correct answer. F.R.E. 704(a)
abolished the "ultimate issue" objection
that once prevented lay and expert wit-
nesses from giving testimony phrased
in terms of the ultimate facts that the
jury must determine. Modernly, opinion
testimony is admissible if it would be
helpful to the jury. See F.R.E. 701 (lay
opinion) and 702 (expert opinion).With
respect to this question, while lay or
expert opinion as to the legal conclu-
sion that the decedent had the " capacity
to make a will" is improper, because
unhelpful, lay and expert opinion as
to the factual basis of such capacity is
admissible as an aid to the jury because
it would assist the jury in determin-
ing the legal issue of the decedent's
"testamentary capacity." An expert is
expected to bring to bear principles of
his or her specialty when testifying as
to an ultimate issue of fact. A, B and C
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer D.  

64. C is the correct answer. F.R.E. 407
permits admissibility of evidence of
subsequent remedial measures when
offered to prove ownership and control.
A, B and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in answer C.

65. A is the correct answer. In a criminal
case, self-interest may be shown when
the witness testifies for the state and
it is shown that a criminal indictment
has been forgiven or lessened for her
testimony. B, C and D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in answer A.

66. C is the correct answer. This question
is testing the student's understanding
of impeachment. F.R.E. 608(b) permits
cross-examination into specific in-
stances of misconduct, which have not
resulted in a criminal conviction, if such
misconduct is pertinent to truthfulness
or veracity. However, this rule prohibits
the use of extrinsic evidence to establish
a prior bad act. Defense counsel cannot
use Tom's testimony for 2 reasons: (1)
because it is extrinsic evidence and (2)
because Tom's testimony regarding the
purchase of marijuana is not pertinent
of truthfulness or veracity. A and B
are incorrect for the reasons stated for
answer C. D is an incorrect statement
of law regarding competency to testify
by a lay person.

67. D is the correct answer. A lay witness
may testify in the form of opinions
and inferences, which are rationally
based on the perception of the witness
and helpful to a clear understanding of
either his testimony or a fact in issue.
A, B and C are incorrect for the reasons
stated in answer D.

68. D is the correct answer. A confidential
communication between an attorney
and his client pertaining to their rela-
tionship is privileged from disclosure.
Any communications made in the
course of preliminary discussions with a
view of employing the lawyer are privi-
leged, even though the employment is
not accepted. The presence of Stan's
father did not remove the element of
"confidentiality." Since Stan is 6 years
old, his father's presence was necessary
for the attorney to render legal service
to Stan. Thus, the presence of A, B and
C are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer D.

69. D is the correct answer. The best evi-
dence rule provides, where a writing
contains terms which are material, the
original writing must be produced,
unless reasons are shown as to why
it is unavailable or unless the writing
pertains to a collateral matter. Here, the
reference to the newspaper is collateral
to the issue of the finalization date. A,
B and C are incorrect for the reasons
stated in answer D.

EVIDENCE

367

70. A is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
609 evidence of a public record of a
criminal conviction involving dishon-
esty or false statement is admissible for
the purpose of attacking the credibility
of a witness. B is incorrect because the
reference to the newspaper story is not
being offered to prove that there was, in
fact, an earthquake in L.A., but merely
to fix the date, in Cam's mind, on which
the Zit Zap Gun was finalized. C and D
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer A.

71. A is the correct answer. F.R.E. 412
permits evidence of specific instances
of past sexual behavior of the victim
with the accused regarding the issue
of the victim's consent. B is incorrect
because it is an incorrect statement of
law. C is incorrect because F.R.E. 412
will permit this type of testimony as
circumstantial evidence that defendant
was on intimate sexual terms with the
victim. D is incorrect because A is the
correct answer.

368 EVIDENCE

72. D is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
609, evidence that an accused was
convicted of a crime can be used to at-
tack the credibility of the accused who
testifies as a witness, if the crime was
punishable by death or imprisonment
in excess of one year and the probative
value of the conviction outweighs its
prejudicial effect, or the crime involves
"dishonesty or false statement" (wheth-
er a felony or a misdemeanor). A crimi-
nal conviction over 10 years old may be
admitted within the court's discretion,
if it is found that the probative value
substantially outweighs the prejudicial
effect, and the adverse party was given
written notice that the conviction was
to be used. Since no written notice was
given to the defense before trial, even if
the court finds that the probative value
substantially outweighs the prejudicial
effect, the objection must be sustained.
A, B, and C are incorrect for the reasons
stated for answer D.

73. D is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
408, evidence that one party offered to
settle or compromise the claim against
another is inadmissible to show liabil-
ity, unless it is offered to prove bias, or
prejudice, or to negate the contentions
of undue delay, or to obstruct a criminal
conviction. Here, the settlement offer
had an admission within it, but any
statements made by the parties when
trying to settle are inadmissible. Note
that the F.R.E. do not permit sever-
ance of admissions of liability from
compromise discussions. A, B and C
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer D.  

74. A is the correct answer. A confidential
communication between an attorney
and her client pertaining to their rela-
tionship is privileged from disclosure.
Bonnie's communication to Steve,
while made with a view of employing
Steve, is privileged, even though the
employment is not accepted. B, C and
D are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer A.

75. A is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
407, evidence of subsequent repairs or
other precautionary measures made fol-
lowing an accident are inadmissible to
prove negligence or culpable conduct.
However, such measures are admis-
sible to show ownership, control, or
feasibility of precautionary measures,
if controverted, and are also admissible
for purposes of impeachment. Since
Mr. Roper denied responsibility, but
went ahead and hired Larry to remove
the tree, the evidence is admissible to
show his control in making the repairs.
B, C and D are incorrect for the reason
stated in answer A.

76. A is the correct answer. Pursuant to
F.R.E. 409, evidence of furnishing,
offering or promising to pay medical,
hospital, or similar expenses occasioned
by an injury is not admissible to prove
liability for the injury. Funeral expenses
are considered to be "similar expenses"
by the court, under this rule. B, C and
D are incorrect for the reason stated in
answer A.

77. C is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
704, testimony in the form of an expert
opinion is not objectionable because it
embraces the ultimate issue or issues to
be decided by the trier of fact. However,
pursuant to F.R.E. 704(b), an expert
who testifies in regard to a criminal
defendant's mental state or condition
may not testify as to whether the defen-
dant did or did not have the mental state
or condition constituting an element
of the crime charged or of a defense
thereto. Thus, the jury is permitted to
draw its own conclusions on the issue.
A is incorrect even if an expert is prop-
erly qualified to testify on matters of
mental state or condition. B is incorrect
because the evidence is improper, even
if it were uncontroverted. D is incorrect
because C is the better answer, and there
is no evidence of bias presented in the
facts.

EVIDENCE

369

78. A is the best answer if the evidence of
prior forgetfulness is offered to show
that Yvette tends to be forgetful. The
testimony of Stephanie is specific in-
stance evidence of Yvette's propensity
to be forgetful to prove that Yvette was
forgetful on the specific occasion in
question (i.e., that she forgot she had
placed the blouse on the outside of her
stroller). While it is true that evidence
showing Yvette forgot that she put the
blouse on the outside of the stroller
tends to show that Yvette was mentally
incapable of forming an intent to steal
the blouse, the evidence does so by
showing that Yvette acted forgetfully
(walking out of the store without her
baby) on a prior occasion. B is incorrect
because Stephanie is not testifying as
to her opinion, but instead is testifying
concerning facts of a prior circum-
stance. Although C may be factually
correct, it is not the best answer. D is
the second best answer because it could
be argued that Yvette lacked the mental
capacity to form the requisite intent to
steal the blouse (forgetting she had it
when she left the store) because she had
the same mental state leaving the same
store on a prior occasion (forgetting her
baby). This reasoning is weak because,
when offered to prove intent or lack
of intent, the prior acts generally must
involve similar conduct committed
under similar circumstances. Leaving a
store with a blouse, without paying for
it, and leaving the same store without
one's baby, six months previously, are
arguably very different circumstances.

370 EVIDENCE

79. D is the correct answer. This question is
intended to further clarify the answer to
Question 78. In contrast to Question 78,
the incident of forgetfulness in Question
79 occurred only two hours before the
incident at Nordstrom's (where Yvette
was charged with shoplifting) and is
more closely related to the incident at
Nordstrom's, involving store merchan-
dise. Yvette's act of leaving behind a
diamond ring for which she had, in fact,
paid, tends to support her story that she
similarly forgot that she had placed the
blouse on the baby carriage as she left
Nordstrom's.

80. C is the correct answer. F.R.E. 702
provides that a witness qualified as an
expert by knowledge, skill, experience
or training may testify on matters of
scientific, technical or other specialized
knowledge thereto, in the form of an
opinion, if it will assist the trier of fact to
understand the evidence or to determine
a fact in issue. Here, Burt's testimony
will assist the trier of fact to determine
whether or not Yvette intended to take
the blouse without paying for it. A and
B are incorrect for the reasons stated
for answer C. D is incorrect because it
is an incorrect statement of law.

81. B is the correct answer. F.R.E. 404(a)
requires that evidence of a character
trait must be relevant to the issue being
tried. Here, non-violence is irrelevant
to the issue of innocence of the crime
of selling narcotics. A, C and D are in-
correct for the reasons stated in answer
B.  

82. A is the correct answer. Where a doctor
examines a party to enable the client to
communicate his or her condition to the
attorney, the attorney-client privilege
applies. Note that where an attorney
employs a physician to examine the
client, the physician's report may not
be privileged under the physician-pa-
tient privilege because no treatment is
contemplated. Therefore, Dr. Cathy's
opinions, which are based on com-
munications from Mark, are protected
from disclosure, because the doctor
was an agent of Mark's lawyer when
the doctor examined Mark. B, C and D
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer A.

83. C is the correct answer. F.R.E. 404(b)
provides that character evidence, to
prove that the accused is a bad person or
had the propensity to commit the crime
for which he is charged, is inadmis-
sible. A is incorrect because there are
not enough facts in the hypothetical to
evidence a plan. B and D are incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer C.

84. C is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
404, evidence of a party's character is
generally inadmissible in civil cases,
unless it is an element of a claim, charge
or defense. Evidence of a person's
character or a trait of character is not
admissible for the purpose of proving
that he acted in conformity therewith,
on a particular occasion. A, B and D are
incorrect for the reason stated in answer
C.

85. B is the correct answer. F.R.E. 803(1)
provides an exception to the hearsay
rule, where a statement describing or
explaining an event or condition is
made while the declarant is perceiving
an event or condition, or immediately
thereafter. Here, Lucy's statement is
admissible because she made it while
observing Fred's driving manner and
her statement describes Fred's driving
manner. A is an incorrect statement.
C and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in answer B.

86. B is the best answer. Pursuant to F.R.E.
803(1), a statement made while perceiv-
ing an event or condition, or immedi-
ately thereafter, and which describes
or explains that event or condition, is
admissible. However, the comment to
F.R.E. 803(1) states that a "slight" time
lapse is permissible. Although Maybel
made the statement a brief period of
time after the incident, her dialing for
the ambulance followed by walking
across the street suggests more than
just a "slight" period of time, and may
indicate deliberate thought. A, C, and
D are incorrect for the reasons stated
in answer B.

EVIDENCE

371

89. B is the correct answer. Under the
F.R.E., an out-of-court statement made
by a party and offered at trial  against
that party is an admission by a party-
opponent which is exempt from the
hearsay rule. Thus, it is not-hearsay. A is
incorrect because Betty is not unavail-
able to testify. C and D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in answer B.

90. A is the correct answer. Statements of
commands and questions have no as-
sertive content; therefore, they cannot
be hearsay. B, C and D are incorrect for
the reason stated for answer A.

91. D is the correct answer. Any statement
made by a machine or animal is not
hearsay. The rationale is that state-
ments from machines and animals are
trustworthy. A, B and C are incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer D.

92. C is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
801, hearsay is an out-of-court state-
ment offered to prove the truth of the
matter asserted. Here, the bill of sale
is being introduced to prove the truth
of Jim's representation that the car is a
Rolls Royce. Thus, it is hearsay and is
inadmissible. A, B and D are incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer C. 

87. A is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
401, evidence having any tendency to
make the existence of any fact that is of
consequence to the determination of the
action more probable or less probable
is generally admissible. Relevant evi-
dence is admissible, unless its probative
value is substantially outweighed by the
danger of unfair prejudice. Under these
facts, the video tape is relevant to show
Tina's intoxication, and although the
tape is prejudicial, its probative value
substantially outweighs its prejudice
to Tina. Thus, it is admissible. B is in-
correct because the F.R.E. follows the
Wigmore theory, which views Tina's
non-assertive conduct as non-hearsay.
C and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in answer A.

88. C is the correct answer. Extrinsic
evidence is inadmissible to impeach a
witness on a collateral matter. Wilma's
testimony of what Betty was wearing on
the day of the incident is extrinsic evi-
dence of a collateral matter because its
sole relevance is to contradict Wilma's
testimony regarding Betty's dress. Wil-
ma's testimony does not tend to prove
or disprove what caused the accident
nor is it relevant to impeach Wilma by
an impeachment method which allows
extrinsic evidence (e.g., to show the
witness' impaired capacity to perceive
or remember). A, B and D are incorrect
for the reasons answer C is correct.

372 EVIDENCE

93. C is the correct answer. Under FRE 608
(b) "specific instances of the conduct
of a witness, for the purpose of attack-
ing or supporting his credibility, other
than conviction of a crime as provided
in rule 609, may not be proved by ex-
trinsic evidence. They may, however, in
of truthfulness or untruthfulness,  be
inquired into on cross-examination of
the witness (1) concerning his character
for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2)
concerning the character for truthful-
ness or untruthfulness of another wit-
ness as to which character the witness
being cross-examined has testified."
The court, therefore, has the discretion
to permit the question to be answered
to impeach Ali By because the question
inquires into Ali's character for truthful-
ness or untruthfulness. A, B and D are
therefore incorrect.

94. A is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
801, an out-of-court statement offered
to prove the truth of the matter asserted
is hearsay and is not allowed in court,
unless there is an exception. Under
these facts, there is no exception to
allow the disciplinary reports in. B is
incorrect because, in federal court, spe-
cific instance evidence of character is
inadmissible under the "victim's excep-
tion" (i.e., to prove Ponch's propensity
to use excessive force to show that
Ponch used excessive force against the
defendant, John). C is incorrect because
a written complaint by a citizen is not a
business record. D is incorrect for the
reasons stated above.

95. C is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
405(b), where character or a trait of
character of a person is an essential
element of a claim, charge, or defense,
proof may be made by reputation, opin-
ion, or specific instances of conduct. In
a wrongful death action, the surviving
I lie survivor is enuueu to prove 111(11 LUG
decedent had a character trait for being
loving and affectionate to demonstrate
the extent of the loss of companionship.
Therefore, the decedent's character trait
becomes a disputed issue. Shirley is
entitled to rebut Laverne's testimony
by evidence that Squiggy was separated
from Laverne for over a two-year pe-
riod, since the decedent's character is
in issue. A and B are incorrect for the
reasons stated in answer C. D is incor-
rect because C is the better answer.

96. A is the correct answer. In a criminal
case in which the defendant is accused
of sexual assault, evidence of a prior
rape is admissible for any relevant pur-
pose. (Also, a prior rape by defendant
in a rape case does fit within the 1994
Violent Crime Control Act.) B is incor-
rect because it is an incorrect statement
of law. C is incorrect because, as stated
above, evidence of a prior rape by de-
fendant is not character evidence. D is
incorrect because it is not prejudicial. 

EVIDENCE 373

97. D is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
1002, the original writing must be of-
fered into evidence, to prove the con-
tents of that writing. Here, Alex seeks
to prove the terms of the contract that
were not complied with. Alex must
produce the contract, since the terms
of the contract are in dispute. A, B and
C are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer D.

98. B is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
608(a), evidence offered to support the
truthfulness of a witness is inadmissi-
ble, until evidence has been admitted to
attack the witness' credibility. Here, the
prosecution seeks to support A's cred-
ibility as a witness by B's testimony,
before X has offered any evidence to
impeach A. A, C and D are incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer B.

99. C is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
801, hearsay evidence is an out-of-court
statement offered to prove the truth of
the matter asserted. Here, William's
testimony is being offered to prove the
matter asserted (i.e., that Jon committed
the robbery). A, B and D are incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer C.

100. A is the best answer. F.R.E. 901(b)(4)
suggests that the contents of the letter
(which Abel testifies was mailed to
him 2 weeks after the accident) satis-
fies the requirement of authentication.
This means that the letter will be ad-
mitted so that the jury can determine
whether, based upon the contents, they
believe the letter was written by Cain.
The contents of the letter is probably
sufficient circumstantial evidence to
let this issue of conditional relevance
go to the jury. B, C and D are incorrect
for the reasons stated for answer A.

101. A is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
801(d)(2), an admission by a party-
opponent is a statement which is
not-hearsay. B is incorrect because it
is an incorrect statement of law. C is
incorrect because, under the F.R.E., a
party admission is not-hearsay, rather
than an exception to the hearsay rule.
D is incorrect for the same reasons that
A is correct.

102. A is the best answer. Under F.R.E.
803(3), a declaration of a then-exist-
ing physical condition is an exception
to the hearsay rule. The declaration
made by Paul, indicating his present
existing bodily condition, is therefore
admissible as an exception. B, C and
D are incorrect for the same reasons
stated in answer A. 

374 EVIDENCE

103. C is the correct answer. Pursuant to
F.R.E. 404(a), character evidence is in-
admissible by the prosecution to prove
conduct by defendant in conformity
therewith on a particular occasion,
unless one of the exceptions applies
(e.g., defendant "opens the door" un-
der the defendant's exception - F.R.E.
404 (a)(1)). A and B are incorrect for
the reasons stated for answer C. D is
incorrect because even if character
evidence in the form of reputation or
opinion were offered, it is not the type
of evidence that makes the evidence
inadmissible, but that defendant has
not "opened the door" by offering
evidence of his good character.

104. D is the correct answer. Pursuant to
F.R.E. 409, evidence of offering or
promising to pay medical expenses
occasioned by an injury is not admis-
sible to prove liability. A, B and D
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer D.

105. C is the correct answer. Under Tram-
mel v. U.S., 445 U.S. 40 (1980), the
witness-spouse may choose whether or
not to testify against the other spouse,
whether or not the other spouse con-
sents. Thus, Teena may properly refuse
to testify against Mike at his battery
trial. A, B and C are incorrect for the
reasons stated in answer C.

106. A is the correct answer. The marital
communication privilege excludes
evidence of confidential communica-
tions made between spouses while
they were married from admissibility
at trial. Since both Mike and Teena are
holders of the privilege, even if Teena
wanted to testify, Mike can prevent
her from disclosing the confidential
statement. If the statement was made
during marriage, a subsequent annul-
ment or dissolution does not terminate
the privilege. B, C and D are incorrect
for the reasons stated in answer A.

107. B is the correct answer. Although Mo-
riarty is not an attorney, the evidence
is inadmissible where the client has
a reasonable belief that he is seeking
advice from an attorney at the time of
his communication. A, C and D are in-
correct for the reason stated in answer
B.

108. C is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
801, any out-of-court statement of-
fered to prove the truth of the matter
asserted is inadmissible hearsay, unless
the hearsay objection can be overcome.
A is incorrect because the report was
prepared for litigation, not to record
regular conduct of the business. Also,
the source of the information, Eddie,
indicates a "lack of trustworthiness,"
since Eddie could potentially be sued,
and therefore has an interest in being
self-serving and making the report
favorable to the Railroad. A, B and
D are incorrect for the same reasons
stated in answer C.

EVIDENCE 375

109. C is the correct answer. Under Shepard
v. U.S., 290 U.S. 96 (1933), an out-
of-court statement asserting the past
conduct of another person is not
admissible because it is hearsay, and
does not fall under the state of mind
exception ("memory" or "belief' of
the declarant does not qualify as the
declarant's "state of mind"). A is in-
correct because the statement is not
a dying declaration. B is incorrect
because the statement is being used to
prove the past conduct of a third party,
not the declarant's state of mind. D is
an incorrect statement of law.

110. B is the correct answer. Under F.R.E.
406, evidence of a person's habit or
routine practice is relevant to prove
conduct in conformity therewith.
Mr. Clean's testimony is relevant to
rebut Bert's allegations that Vons was
negligent in permitting the candy to
be present on the floor. A, C and D
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
answer B.

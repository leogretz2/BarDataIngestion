CIVIL PROCEDURE
QUESTIONS

Questions 1 - 5 are based on the
following facts:

Mack is an interstate truck driver. He sud-
denly fell ill while driving his rig through
Phoenix, Arizona, after returning from a
delivery in Houston, Texas. He was on his
way to his home in Los Angeles. Mack
pulled off the interstate onto Main Street
in downtown Phoenix and pulled into the
first doctor's office that he saw nearest to
the interstate. It was Dr. Feelgood's office
on Main Street. Dr. Feelgood had a sign
that was visible to motorists just after they
exited the off-ramp and entered Main Street.
After being treated by Dr. Feelgood, Mack
got back on the interstate and returned home
to Los Angeles. When he arrived home,
Mack became violently ill and brought suit
against Dr. Feelgood for malpractice in fed-
eral district court in Los Angeles, claiming
$100,000 in damages.

1. Mack served Dr. Feelgood pur-
suant to California's Long Arm
statute, which authorizes the
exercise of personal jurisdic-
tion to the extent permitted by
the Fourteenth Amendment. Dr.
Feelgood made no pre-answer
motions and, in his answer, de-
nied the allegations in Mack's
complaint. He also asserted the
affirmative defense that the court
lacked personal jurisdiction over
him. Dr. Feelgood then moved
to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction. Which of the fol-
lowing is the most correct ruling
by the court on Dr. Feelgood's
motion?

A. The court has personal jurisdic-
tion, because Dr. Feelgood failed
to assert lack of personal juris-
diction in a pre-answer motion;
thus, he waived this defense.

B. The court has personal jurisdic-
tion because Dr. Feelgood did
not confine his response just to
attacking personal jurisdiction
but also addressed the merits of
the suit, which is deemed to be
a general appearance and, thus,
consented to personal jurisdic-
tion by Dr. Feelgood. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 49

A. The court cannot exercise per-
sonal jurisdiction over Dr. Feel-
good, because he did not pur-
posefully reach into California
to receive a benefit. He came to
California because his son hap-
pened to be lying in a hospital
bed in California.

B. The court cannot exercise per-
sonal jurisdiction over Dr. Feel-
good, because California has no
interest in adjudicating a dispute
arising out of medical services
rendered in Arizona.

C. The court can exercise personal
jurisdiction over Dr. Feelgood,
because Dr. Feelgood was served
with a summons in Los Ange-
les.

D. The court can exercise personal
jurisdiction over Dr. Feelgood,
because California has an over-
whelming interest in opening its
courts to one of its citizens who
was injured by medical malprac-
tice.  

C. The court does not have personal
jurisdiction over Dr. Feelgood
because he is just a local Phoenix
doctor who intends to serve only
the market in and around the
neighborhood where his office
is located.

D. The court has personal jurisdic-
tion over Dr. Feelgood because
his location near an interstate
off-ramp, with a sign visible by
motorists after they exited the
off-ramp, constitutes purposeful
availment of interstate business
by Dr. Feelgood.

2. Assume, for purposes of this question
only, that the court granted Dr. Feel-
good's motion to dismiss in Question 1.
Two months after Mack's federal court
suit was dismissed, Dr. Feelgood's son
was seriously injured in an automobile
accident while he was vacationing
in southern California. Dr. Feelgood
rushed to Los Angeles to be at his son's
bedside in the hospital. While at the
hospital, Mack had Dr. Feelgood served
with a summons in connection with
a second suit (for malpractice claim-
ing $100,000 in damages) that Mack
had filed in the federal district court
in Los Angeles. Dr. Feelgood made a
pre-answer motion to dismiss on the
grounds that the court cannot assert
personal jurisdiction under the Due
Process Clause. Which of the following
is the best ruling on this motion?

50 CIVIL PROCEDURE

Q

3. Assume, for purposes of this question,
that the court denied Dr. Feelgood's
motion in Question 2. Dr. Feelgood
filed a timely answer denying all of
the allegations in Mack's complaint.
Dr. Feelgood also served a summons
and third-party complaint on Drugco, a
pharmaceutical company incorporated
in California whose principal place of
business is in California. Dr. Feelgood
claimed that Mack became violently ill
upon his return to Los Angeles because
of a drug - Cyclopropane - which Dr.
Feelgood administered to Mack. Dr.
Feelgood alleges that Cyclopropane is
defective under the law of products li-
ability, and that Drugco is solely liable
to Mack. Drugco moved to dismiss the
third-party action. Which of the fol-
lowing is the best ruling on Drugco's
motion?

A. The third-party action should
be dismissed, because Drugco
and Mack are both California
citizens, and Drugco's impleader
destroyed diversity of citizen-
ship.

B. The third-party action is proper,
because Dr. Feelgood is assert-
ing a derivative claim against
Drugco, claiming that, if Dr.
Feelgood is passively liable to
Mack for administering the drug
Cyclopropane to Mack, then
Drugco, the active tortfeasor,
must indemnify Dr. Feelgood.

C. The third-party action is im-
proper, because Dr. Feelgood's
complaint does not assert a de-
rivative claim against Drugco.

D. The third-party action is proper,
because Dr. Feelgood's claim
against Drugco arises out of the
same transaction or occurrence
as Mack's main claim against Dr.
Feelgood.

4. Assume, for purposes of this question,
that the court granted Drugco's motion
in Question 3. Dr. Feelgood then served
another timely summons and third-
party complaint against Drugco making
the following claims against Drugco: 1)
if Dr. Feelgood is held to be liable to
Mack for having administered Cyclo-
propane to Mack, then Drugco is liable
to Dr. Feelgood for all or part of Mack's
claim against Dr. Feelgood; and 2) a
slander claim for $80,000 arising out
of a statement by Drugco to a Phoenix
newspaper reporter that Mack's injuries
were caused by Dr. Feelgood's lack of
rudimentary sanitary practices in con-
nection with administering injections;
and 3) a claim for a $60,000 unpaid
fee for Dr. Feelgood's participation in
a testing program involving an experi-
mental drug (Fixall) manufactured by
Drugco. On Drugco's motion to dismiss
all of these claims, which is the correct
ruling?

CIVIL PROCEDURE 51

Q  

A. Claim 1 is proper, because it is a
derivative claim against Drugco;
Claim 2 is proper because it
arises out of the same transaction
as Mack's main claim; Claim 3
is improper because it does not
arise out of the same transaction
as Mack's claim.

B. Claim 1 is proper, because it is a
derivative claim against Drugco,
but Claims 2 and 3 are improper
because they are not derivative
claims against Drugco.

C. Claim 1 is proper, because it is a
derivative claim against Drugco;
Claim 2 is proper under F.R.C.P.
18; but Claim 3 is not proper
under F.R.C.P. 18.

D. Claim 1 is proper, because it is a
derivative claim against Drugco;
and both Claims 2 and 3 are
proper under F.R.C.P. 18.

5. Assume, for purposes of this question,
that the court denied Drugco's motion
in Question 3. It dismissed none of the
three claims in the third-party com-
plaint. On the fourth day of trial, the
judge discovered that two weeks after
Dr. Feelgood filed the second third-
party complaint with the court, Drugco
had changed its state of incorporation
from California to Arizona. The judge
asks you, his law clerk, whether the
court can still exercise subject matter
jurisdiction over claim 3 in the third-
party complaint. Which of the following
responses is most nearly correct?

A. Dismiss claim 3, because the
court cannot exercise supple-
mental jurisdiction over that
claim since it does not relate to
either claim 1 or to Mack's main
claim.

B. Do not dismiss claim 3, because
any subject matter jurisdiction
objection relating to this claim
is, by now, waived.

C. Do not dismiss claim 3, because
it was properly joined under Rule
18 and supplemental jurisdic-
tion is intended to support the
policies underlying the liberal
federal joinder rules. 

52 CIVIL PROCEDURE

D. Do not dismiss claim 3, because
citizenship of the parties, for
diversity purposes, is determined
at the time the third-party com-
plaint was filed and, at that time,
diversity was complete.

Questions 6 - 9 are based upon the
following facts:

Dave owns and operates a BurgerQuick
restaurant under a franchise agreement with
the BurgerQuick Corporation. BurgerQuick
Corporation franchises fast-food restaurants
nationwide and advertises the BurgerQuick
trade-name nationally. BurgerQuick Cor-
poration is a New York corporation with its
headquarters in New York City. Although
Dave resides in San Diego, Dave's restaurant
is located in Santa Ana, California just off
the 17th Street exit ramp of the Interstate
5 freeway. Pat, a New Yorker, was touring
southern California and was en route from
Los Angeles to San Diego when she spotted
Dave's BurgerQuick sign from the freeway.
She pulled off the freeway, pulled into
Dave's restaurant, had a "Big Quick" with all
the fixings. She then proceeded on her way
to San Diego. When she reached San Diego,
Pat suffered severe stomach cramps. She at-
tributed the cramps to food poisoning from
the "Big Quick" she had consumed. When
she returned to New York City, she filed a
personal injury suit against Dave in a federal
district court in Manhattan for $80,000. Pat
served Dave under New York's Long Arm
statute. New York law requires a defendant
to enter a special appearance to challenge
personal jurisdiction. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 53

Q

6. Dave filed an answer denying that his
food caused injury to Pat. Dave also as-
serted a defense of lack of personal ju-
risdiction. Dave then moved to dismiss
Pat's complaint for lack of personal
jurisdiction (under the Due Process
Clause of the U.S. Constitution). Which
of the following is the most nearly cor-
rect ruling?

A. The court can exercise personal
jurisdiction over Dave, since
Dave has waived his lack of
personal jurisdiction defense
because, under Erie, New York
State's "special appearance" law
governs the issue of how to chal-
lenge personal jurisdiction in a
diversity case in federal court.

B. The court cannot, under the
Due Process Clause, exercise
personal jurisdiction over Dave
because Dave did not intend to
serve the national or New York
market with his burgers, fries and
shakes; Dave's contact with New
York is merely unilateral.

C. The court can, under the Due
Process Clause, exercise per-
sonal jurisdiction over Dave
because Dave did intend to serve
the national or New York market
with his burgers, fries and shakes
by deliberately choosing to lo-
cate his restaurant alongside an
interstate off-ramp with his sign
visible from the interstate.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

D. The court can, under the Due
Process Clause, exercise person-
al jurisdiction over Dave because
Dave deliberately entered into
a long-term franchise contract
with a New York franchiser.
Further, Dave reaps the benefits
of national advertising by the
franchiser of the BurgerQuick
trade name.

7. Assume, for purposes of this question,
that Dave timely amended his motion
to add a second ground for challenging
personal jurisdiction, namely, lack of
authorization by the New York Long
Arm Statute. The relevant section of
the Long Arm Statute provides:

"As to a cause of action arising from
any of the acts enumerated in this sec-
tion, a court may exercise personal
jurisdiction over any non-domiciliary
who commits a tortious act within the
state causing injury to person or prop-
erty within the state if he regularly does
or solicits business, or engages in any
other persistent course of conduct, or
derives substantial revenue from goods
used or consumed or services rendered,
in the state."

Which of the following are plausible
arguments for Dave to make under New
York's Long Arm statute?

I. Dave did not cause injury
to person or property
within New York State.

II. Dave does not derive
substantial revenue from
goods used or consumed
or services rendered in
New York State.

III. Dave does not regularly
do or solicit business in
New York State.

IV. Dave did not purpose-
fully avail himself of the
benefits and protections
of New York law.

V. Dave did not transact
business within New
York State.

A. I, II and III only.

B. I, H, III and V only.

C. All of the above.

D. None of the above.

8. Assume, for purposes of this question,
that in addition to serving Dave with
a summons pursuant to New York's
Long Arm Statute, Pat, for the purpose
of securing quasi-in-rem jurisdiction,
had the sheriff seize a Certificate of
Deposit that Dave maintained in the
Bank of New York in New York City.
Dave opened the account in New York
City because of the favorable interest
rates. Assume that New York has a
limited appearance statute observed by
the federal court. This statute allows
a defendant whose New York prop-
erty has been seized for jurisdictional
purposes to enter an appearance for
the limited purpose of defending the
property on the merits without being
deemed to have appeared generally. On
a motion by Dave to dismiss for lack of
quasi-in-rem jurisdiction under the Due
Process Clause, which of the following
arguments are not plausible under the
Supreme Court's opinion in Shaffer v.
Heitner?

A. The court cannot exercise quasi-
in-rem jurisdiction, because
Dave's property is completely
unrelated to the cause of action
asserted by Pat.

B. The court can exercise quasi-in-
rem jurisdiction, because prop-
erty owned by Dave was seized
within the territory of New York
State.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 55

III. Removal is improper
because Dave did not file
the petition for removal
in the proper federal ju-
dicial district.

A. I only.

B. II only.

C. III only.

D. II and III only.

C. The court can exercise quasi-
in-rem jurisdiction, because
Dave deliberately purchased a
Certificate of Deposit in a New
York bank and he can defend that
property by entering a limited
appearance.

D. The court cannot exercise quasi-
in-rem jurisdiction, because
Dave has no other contacts with
New York and the Certificate of
Deposit, viewed as Dave's only
contact with New York, is not
indisputably and permanently
located in New York.

9. Assume, for purposes of this question,
that Pat had filed suit against Dave in a
California Superior Court in San Diego
(which, in the federal court system,
is located in the Southern District of
California). Dave filed a petition to
remove the action in the federal district
court in Santa Ana, which is located in
the Central District of California. On
motion by Pat to remand, which of the
following arguments are correct?

I. Removal is proper be-
cause the federal court
has diversity jurisdiction
over the action.

II. Removal is improper
because Dave is a citizen
of California. 

56 CIVIL PROCEDURE

Questions 10 -14 are based upon
the following facts:

Dirk owns a business in Fullerton. This
business assembles custom "special order"
motorcycles. Paul, one of Dirk's customers
and a Nevadan, asked Dirk to put together a
"souped-up" motor bike that would "really
burn rubber." Dirk knew of a "special" fuel
injection system microchip that enables the
motorcycle in which it is installed to accel-
erate three times faster than commercially
manufactured bikes. The "special" micro-
chip is not sold in the U.S. because it is il-
legal under the laws of most states, including
California. However, it is manufactured and
sold only in Japan by CompuChip, Inc., a
Japanese corporation. Dirk asked a friend of
his to buy ten "special" chips for him while
in Tokyo on a business trip. Dirk's friend
purchased the chips and told CompuChip
that they were going to be installed in mo-
tor bikes in California. Aside from the one
sale to Dirk's friend, CompuChip has sold
no other "special" chips in the U.S. Dirk as-
sembled the motorcycle requested by Paul,
installing the "special" computer chip. Paul
was seriously injured in an accident with
his new motorcycle. He brought a products
liability suit for $100,000 in damages against
Dirk and CompuChip, Inc. in federal district
court in Santa Ana, California, claiming that
the special computer chip was defective.
Both Fullerton and Santa Ana are located
within the Central District of California.

10. CompuChip made a pre-answer motion
under F.R.C.P. 12(b)(2) to dismiss the
claim against it for lack of personal
jurisdiction under the Due Process
Clause. Which of the following is (are)
a plausible argument(s) for either Paul
or CompuChip?

I. As in the Asahi case,
whether or not Com-
puChip purposefully
availed itself of the Cali-
fornia market, it would
be fundamentally un-
reasonable and unfair
for a court in California
to exercise personal ju-
risdiction because the
interests of the plaintiff
and the forum in the as-
sertion of jurisdiction by
the federal court in Cali-
fornia is slight and the
burden on CompuChip
in defending thousands
of miles from Japan and
in a foreign legal system
is great.

II. CompuChip did not pur-
posefully avail itself of
the California market
because it performed
no action that was pur-
posefully directed at the
forum state. Therefore,
the court cannot exer-
cise personal jurisdiction
over CompuChip.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

57

Q

11. For purposes of this question only,
assume that the court granted Compu-
Chip's pre-answer motion in Question
10. Which of the following additional
facts would have arguably changed the
result?

A. Although CompuChip has never
intentionally marketed its "spe-
cial" high acceleration com-
puter chips in the U.S., it does
regularly and deliberately market
"ordinary" computer chips for
installation in fuel injection sys-
tems in motor cycles.

B. Evidence reveals that Compu-
Chip knew of the defect in the
design of its "special" computer
chip, that there was a feasible,
though more expensive, alter-
native design, but CompuChip
deliberately refused to adopt the
alternative design.

C. CompuChip has extensive real
estate holdings in California for
investment purposes.

D. CompuChip entered into a con-
tract with a California company
to design certain computer soft-
ware to go with CompuChip's
PC computers.

III. CompuChip did purpose-
fully avail itself of the
California market by
deliberately placing the
ten "special" computer
chips into the stream of
commerce when it rea-
sonably knew that such
chips would flow to Cali-
fornia where they would
be installed as a compo-
nent in motorcycles to be
sold in California.

IV. Even though Compu-
Chip did not purpose-
fully avail itself of the
California market, the
court can exercise per-
sonal jurisdiction over
CompuChip because it
is fair and reasonable in
light of the great interest
to both the plaintiff and
the forum state in having
Paul's claim adjudicated
in a California court.

A. I only.

B.

II only.

C. IV only.

D. I and III only.

58 CIVIL PROCEDURE

12. For purposes of this question only,
assume that the court denied Compu-
Chip's pre-answer motion in Question
10. CompuChip subsequently moved
to dismiss Paul's claim against it on
grounds of improper venue. Which of
the following rulings is most nearly
correct?

A. Venue is proper, because both
defendants reside in California.
In addition, the computer chip in
question was incorporated into
Paul's motorcycle in Fullerton.

B. Venue is improper, because
CompuChip resides in Japan and
Dirk resides in California.

C. Venue is proper, because Paul
resides in Orange County.

D. CompuChip has waived its venue

objection.

13. Assume, for purposes of this ques-
tion only, that CompuChip's motions
in Questions 10 and 12 were denied.
Dirk timely amended his answer to
assert two claims against codefendant
CompuChip: (1) a claim for indemnity
in the event that a judgment is entered
against both defendants, holding them
jointly and severally liable to Paul, and
Paul collects the entire amount from
Dirk; and (2) a claim for $80,000 in
damages to Dirk's business, arising
out of the failure of certain "ordinary"
computer chips purchased by Dirk
from CompuChip to perform as war-
ranted. CompuChip moved to dismiss
the second of these two claims. Which
of the following rulings is most nearly
correct?

A. The second claim should be dis-
missed, because the court cannot
assert supplemental jurisdiction
over a claim that is neither re-
lated to Paul's main claim nor to
Dirk's proper cross-claim against
CompuChip for indemnity.

B. The second claim should be dis-
missed, because it is an improper
cross-claim. It does not arise out
of the same transaction as Paul's
main claim.

C. The second claim should not be
dismissed, because it is properly
joined. The first claim asserted
by Dirk against CompuChip is a
proper cross-claim.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 59

D. CompuChip waived its objection
to subject matter jurisdiction,
because it omitted that objec-
tion from its pre-answer motion
before the district court. 

Q

D. The second claim should be dis-
missed on the grounds that the
court cannot exercise personal
jurisdiction over CompuChip.

14. Assume that Paul's lawsuit against Dirk
and CompuChip proceeded through
trial culminating in a judgment for
$40,000 in damages against both de-
fendants imposing upon them joint and
several liability for injury to Paul. For
the first time on appeal (to the Court
of Appeals), CompuChip attacked the
validity of the judgment on the grounds
that the district court lacked subject
matter jurisdiction. Which of the fol-
lowing rulings by the Court of Appeals
is most nearly correct?

A. CompuChip cannot challenge the
validity of the judgment against
it on grounds of lack of subject
matter jurisdiction, because
alienage jurisdiction supports
Paul's claim against Compu-
Chip.

B. The judgment against each
defendant is invalid for lack of
diversity jurisdiction, since the
damage award against each de-
fendant was only $30,000.

C. The judgment against each
defendant is invalid for lack of
diversity jurisdiction, since Paul
and Dirk are both Californians.

60 CIVIL PROCEDURE

Questions 15 -18 are based upon
the following facts:

Pam, who lives in San Diego, brought suit
in the federal district court for the Southern
District of California in San Diego against
Doug and Diana. Doug also resides in San
Diego, and Diana, a U.S. citizen, resides in
Istanbul, Turkey. Pam served Diana under
California's Long Arm statute. Pam's com-
plaint alleged that Doug and Diana conspired
in Istanbul to violate the Sherman Antitrust
Act. Diana's answer raised the defense of
improper venue. She subsequently moved
to dismiss the suit on grounds of improper
venue.

15. Which of the following rulings is most

nearly correct?

A. Diana has waived her venue
objection, because she failed to
raise it in a pre-answer motion.

B. Venue is improper, because both
defendants do not reside in Cali-
fornia and a substantial part of
the events giving rise to the claim
did not occur in California.

C. Venue is proper, because both de-
fendants are subject to personal
jurisdiction in the Southern Dis-
trict of California at the time that
the action was commenced.

D. Venue is proper, because Doug
could be found in the Southern
District of California and there
was no district in which the ac-
tion could otherwise have been
brought.

16. Assume, for purposes of this (and suc-
ceeding) questions, that the court denied
Diana's venue motion in question 15.
Diana then moved to transfer the suit to
Turkey under Title 28, U.S.C. section
1404 "for the convenience of parties
and witnesses" and "in the interest of
justice." Which of the following argu-
ments for either plaintiff or defendant
is the least plausible?

A. A Turkish court would be likely
to apply Turkish law and, al-
though Turkey has a body of law
that is roughly the equivalent of
U.S. antitrust law, it would be
somewhat more difficult for Pam
to win a judgment against Diana
under substantive Turkish law.
Therefore, a Turkish court is not
a viable alternative forum and
the suit against Diana cannot be
transferred.

B. The action against Diana should
be dismissed under forum non-
conveniens, because all the evi-
dence is in Turkey and most of
the documents are in Turkish. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE

C. The action against Diana cannot
be transferred from a U.S. court
to a Turkish court because the
U.S. court has no authority in
Turkey.

D. The action against Diana should
not be dismissed under forum
non-conveniens, because Pam's
claim against Doug would re-
main in the federal court in Cali-
fornia thereby splitting the two
related claims into two lawsuits
in two countries.

17. Diana also timely asserted the defense
of lack of personal jurisdiction over her
and moved to dismiss on that ground.
The court granted her motion and dis-
missed Pam's claim against Diana find-
ing insufficient contacts between Diana
and California that relate to the antitrust
claim. Pam, thereupon, located a bank
account maintained by Diana with the
Bank of America in San Diego where
Diana had deposited money she inher-
ited from her Aunt Cecily. Diana has
made no other deposits or withdrawals
from that account since the original
deposit of the inheritance money. Pam
attached Diana's bank account for
the purpose of securing quasi-in-rem
jurisdiction. Assume that California
offers Diana the right to enter a limited
appearance. Diana timely moved to
challenge the exercise of quasi-in-rem
jurisdiction, requesting the court again
to dismiss Pam's claim against her on
jurisdictional grounds. Which of the
following arguments for either plaintiff
or defendant is the least plausible?

A. It is fair to exercise quasi-in-
rem jurisdiction, because Diana
deliberately chose to open the ac-
count in a California bank. Any
judgment entered against Diana
will be limited to the money in
that account.

62 CIVIL PROCEDURE

B. It is unfair to exercise quasi-in-
rem jurisdiction, because the
sole contact between Diana and
California appears to be the bank
account. Pam's cause of action
does not relate to that bank ac-
count.

C. The court can exercise quasi-in-
rem jurisdiction based upon the
attachment of the bank account,
because the bank account was
seized within the territory of the
State of California.

D. It is unfair to exercise quasi-in-
rem jurisdiction, because Diana
should not reasonably anticipate
that, as a consequence of opening
a bank account in California, she
would have to defend an antitrust
suit having nothing to do with
California in a court located in
California.

18. Assume, for purposes of this question,
that the court denied Diana's motion
in Question 17. Two months later, Pam
amended her complaint to include ad-
ditional claims against Doug and Diana
under the state common law of business
torts (based upon the same conduct by
Doug underlying Paul's antitrust claim).
After two years of discovery, Doug and
Diana each moved for summary judg-
ment to dismiss Pam's Sherman Act
claim. The court granted this. Doug then
moved to dismiss the state tort claim
against him on the ground that the court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear
that claim. Which of the following rul-
ings is most nearly correct?

A. The court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction over the state law
claim, because Pam and Doug
are both California citizens.

B. The court must exercise supple-
mental jurisdiction over the state
law claim against Doug.

C. The court may, in its discretion,
exercise supplemental jurisdic-
tion over the state law claim
against Doug.

D. The court cannot exercise sup-
plemental jurisdiction over the
state law claim against Doug
because the Sherman Antitrust
claim was dismissed.

Questions 19 - 23 are based upon
the following facts:

Pauline was involved in an automobile col-
lision with Dan and Dotty in Las Vegas,
Nevada on June 1, 1990. At the time of
the collision, Pauline, a native Californian,
lived in Hollywood and was struggling to
"make it in the movies." Dan, also a native
Californian, lived in Fullerton, California.
Dotty was a citizen of Nevada. Two weeks
after the collision, on June 14, 1990, Pauline
terminated the lease on her Beverly Hills
apartment and rented an apartment in Las
Vegas, where she commenced working as a
blackjack dealer in a local casino. A month
later, on July 14, 1990, Pauline filed a per-
sonal injury suit against Dan for $200,000
in federal district court in Los Angeles, and
served process on Dan a week later. Three
months after filing suit (October 14, 1990),
Pauline won $14 million in the Nevada State
Lottery. She subsequently quit her casino
job, rented out her house in Las Vegas and
moved back to Bel Air, California where she
bought an expensive home. She started her
own movie company (so she could star in
her own pictures.) She has remained there
ever since.

19. On November 1, 1990, Dan moved to
dismiss Pauline's claims against him
on the grounds that the court lacked
subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the
following arguments are not correct?

I. The fact that Pauline
moved back to Califor-
nia three months after
filing suit and bought an
expensive home there
shows that Pauline was
not a Nevadan at the
time she filed suit. Thus,
diversity was not com-
plete.

II. The fact that Pauline and
Dan were both Califor-
nians at the time of the
collision deprives the
court of diversity juris-
diction.

III. The fact that Pauline
terminated her Beverly
Hills lease and was living
and working in Las Ve-
gas at the time she filed
suit shows that Pauline
was a Nevadan at that
time. Thus, diversity was
complete.

IV. Because the collision
occurred in Nevada, Pau-
line's cause of action has
no substantial connection
with California. Thus,
the federal court in Los
Angeles does not have
subject matter jurisdic-
tion over this claim.

A. I only.  

64 CIVIL PROCEDURE

B. I and II only.

C.

I, II and III only.

D. II and IV only.

20. Assume, for purposes of this question
(and succeeding questions), that Dan's
motion in Question 19 was denied.
Dan subsequently served a timely
third-party complaint and summons on
Dotty while she was visiting her aunt
for a day in Banning, California. Dan's
third-party complaint stated a claim for
contribution among joint-tortfeasors, a
state-law tort, alleging that Dotty was
50% at fault. In response, Dotty served
on Dan a third-party answer in which
she denied any responsibility for the
collision and also included a defense
of lack of personal jurisdiction. Dotty
then moved to dismiss the third-party
complaint. Which of the following rul-
ings is most nearly correct?

A. Because the sole basis for subject
matter jurisdiction over Dan's
third-party claim is diversity
jurisdiction, Erie requires that
the court apply California's state
court "special appearance" rule.
Applying such rule, Dotty has
waived her defense of lack of
personal jurisdiction.

B. The court cannot exercise per-
sonal jurisdiction over Dotty, a
non-resident of California, be-
cause Dan's contribution claim
against Dotty arose out of Dot-
ty's driving a car in Nevada, not
in California.

C. Dan improperly impleaded
Dotty, because it is solely the
prerogative of the plaintiff which
of the several joint tortfeasors to
sue.

D. Dotty was properly impleaded
and is subject to personal juris-
diction, because she was served
with process in California.

21. Assume, for purposes of this and suc-
ceeding questions, that Dotty's motion
in Question 20 was denied. Dan subse-
quently amended his third-party com-
plaint to assert a claim against Dotty
for $30,000 worth of property damage
to his car caused by Dotty's negligent
driving. Dotty moved to dismiss this
new claim. Which of the following rul-
ings is most nearly correct?

A. Dan's second claim for property
damage is improperly impleaded
because it is an independent, and
not a contingent, claim.

B. Dan's second claim for property
damage is not supported by di-
versity jurisdiction because the
amount in controversy is only
$30,000. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 65

Q

D. Pauline's claim against Dotty
is supported by supplemental
jurisdiction, because her claim
against Dotty is sufficiently re-
lated to her claim against Dan.

23. Assume, for purposes of this question,
that Dotty's motion in Question 22 was
granted. Subsequently, Dotty asserted,
in the appropriate manner, a negligence
claim in the amount of $40,000 directly
against Pauline for personal injury
arising out of the same auto accident.
Pauline moved to dismiss this claim.
Which of the following rulings is most
nearly correct?

A. Dotty's claim is supported by
supplemental jurisdiction, be-
cause this "Rule 14" counter-
claim is sufficiently related to
Pauline's claim against Dan.

B. Dotty's claim is supported by
supplemental jurisdiction, be-
cause prior to the Judicial Im-
provements Act, case law ruled
that federal courts will assert
ancillary jurisdiction over "com-
pulsory" counterclaims.

C. Dotty's claim is not supported
by supplemental jurisdiction,
because it would violate the
principle of the Kroger case by
opening the door to wholesale
evasion of the complete diversity
requirement. 

C. Dan's second claim for property
damage is properly joined under
F.R.C.P. 18. Further, Dan's two
claims together meet the amount
in controversy requirement.

D. Although Dan's second claim for
property damage falls below the
amount in controversy require-
ment, the court can adjudicate
the claim because of supplemen-
tal jurisdiction.

22. On August 1, 1991, Pauline amended
her complaint to add a personal injury
claim for $200,000 directly against Dot-
ty. Dotty moved to dismiss this claim on
the ground that the court lacked subject
matter jurisdiction. Which of the fol-
lowing rulings is most nearly correct?

A. Pauline's claim against Dotty
should be dismissed, because at
the time Pauline filed her claim
against Dan, Pauline, like Dotty,
was a Nevada citizen.

B. Pauline's claim should be dis-
missed, because the California
court cannot exercise personal
jurisdiction over Dotty who is a
Nevada citizen.

C. Pauline's claim is supported by
diversity jurisdiction, because
at the time Pauline amended
her complaint, she had become,
once again, a California citizen
and Dotty remained a Nevada
citizen.

66 CIVIL PROCEDURE

D. Dotty's claim is supported by
diversity jurisdiction, because
at the time Dotty asserted this
claim, Pauline had become,
once again, a California citizen
and Dotty remained a Nevada
citizen.

24. Shrimpboats, Inc. owns seven com-
mercial fishing vessels. Each of these
boats is operated by a captain and two
crewmen. The I.R.S. assessed and
collected employment taxes for the
crewmen from Shrimpboats, Inc., tak-
ing the position that Shrimpboats, Inc.
was the "employer" of the crewmen.
Shrimpboats, Inc. thereupon sued the
U.S. Government for the refund of the
employment taxes. The U.S. Govern-
ment served a third-party complaint and
summons on each of the captains alleg-
ing that, if Shrimpboats, Inc. was able
to prove that it was not the "employer"
of the crewmen and, thus, not liable
for their employment taxes, it would
automatically follow that the captains
were the "employers" of the crewmen
and would be liable to pay the U.S. the
very employment taxes the U.S. would
have to refund to Shrimpboats, Inc. The
captains moved to dismiss the third-
party complaint against themselves.
Which of the following rulings is most
nearly correct? 

0 0
-<
-

C

A. Impleader of the captains is prop-
er, because the liability of the
captains arises out of the same
operative facts as Shrimpboats,
Inc.'s refund claim against the
U.S. Government.

B. Impleader of the captains is prop-
er, because either Shrimpboats,
Inc. or the captains are liable as
"employers" for the crewmen's
employment taxes.

C. Impleader of the captains is
improper, because the U.S.
Government's claim against the
captains is not a contingent or
derivative claim but, rather, an
independent claim based upon
the captains' liability to the U.S.
(under the tax code).

D. Impleader of the captains is
proper, because, otherwise, the
U.S. will be exposed to the risk
of inconsistent judgments if it
has to assert its claim against
the captains in a separate lawsuit
with a separate trial.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

67

C. The motion should be granted,
because it is prejudicial to the
defendants to have the two
separate lawsuits being carried
on simultaneously. Medco's de-
fense will be that the plate was
not defective but that the doctor
and hospital were negligent. On
the other hand, the doctor's and
the hospital's defense will be that
they were not negligent, but that
the plate was defective.

D. The motion should be denied, be-
cause plaintiffs have an absolute
right to decide whom to sue.

25. Pete underwent surgery in which a
"plate and screw" device was implanted
in his lower spine. The surgical proce-
dure caused Pete greater discomfort
than did his previous condition. The
device was manufactured by Medco,
Inc. The surgery was performed by Dr.
Zorba at St. Nowhere Hospital. Pete
brought a state court suit against Dr.
Zorba and the hospital for malpractice
and negligence. Pete also filed suit in
federal district court against Medco,
Inc. alleging defective design and
manufacture of the device. Medco filed
a motion: (1) to require Pete to join the
doctor and the hospital as defendants
arguing that they are "necessary par-
ties" under F.R.C.P. 19(a); and (2) if
Pete is unable to join the doctor and
hospital, the court must dismiss Pete's
suit arguing that doctor and hospital are
"indispensable" parties under F.R.C.P.
19 (b). Which of the following rulings
is most nearly correct?

A. The motion should be denied,
because joint tortfeasors are not
"necessary" or "indispensable"
parties.

B. The motion should be granted,
because the public's interest in
judicial economy will be harmed
by multiple lawsuits where one
federal suit can resolve the con-
troversy.

Questions 26 - 34 are based upon
the following facts:

On June 1, 1992, a Global Airways jetliner,
Flight 101, crashed at San Diego airport,
seriously injuring most of the 700 passengers
on board. On August 1, 1993, Pete, a partner
with a large firm specializing in air-disaster
litigation, was one of the lucky passengers on
board Flight 101 who suffered only a broken
arm and a concussion. Pete commenced a
class action against Global in federal dis-
trict court in San Diego claiming $75,000
in individual damages and an aggregate of
$40 million in damages for the class. Pilot
error was alleged as the proximate cause of
the crash. Pete, who himself has extensive
experience in air-disaster litigation, named
himself as the class representative and hired
his law firm as counsel for the class. Pete
headed up the litigation to prosecute the class
action against Global.

26. At the class certification hearing on the
issue of the adequacy of class represen-
tation by Pete, which of the following
arguments is most nearly correct?

A. Class representation by Pete
would be adequate, because Pete
has extensive experience as an
attorney in air-disaster litiga-
tion.

B. Class representation by Pete
would be adequate, because
Pete's law firm gives the class
access to substantial financial
and clerical resources.

C. Class representation by Pete
would be inadequate, because
he claims only $75,000 in dam-
ages.

D. Class representation would be
inadequate, because Pete's serv-
ing as class counsel and as class
representative would present a
conflict of interest.

27. At the certification hearing, the court
must categorize Pete's class action as a
(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(2) and/or (b)(3)
class action. On this issue, which of the
following classifications is most nearly
correct?

A. This is a "prejudice" (b)(1)(A)
class action because the pros-
ecution of individual damage
suits by class members could
prejudice Global by imposing
on Global inconsistent results.
Some plaintiffs could win and
some could lose.

B. This is a "prejudice (b)(1)(B)
class action because some class
members who are the first to
bring their individual suits and
who win large damage awards
against Global could bankrupt
the airline leaving no funds re-
maining to pay later judgments
in favor of other plaintiffs. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 69

C. This is an "injunctive" (b)(2)
class action because Global has
acted on grounds generally ap-
plicable to the class. It flew all
class members as passengers on
the same plane, thereby making
appropriate declaratory relief
with respect to the class as a
whole.

D. This is a "damage" (b)(3) class
action because all members of
the class claim to have been
injured by Global in a similar
way.

28. Assume, for purposes of this and suc-
ceeding questions, that the court grant-
ed class certification. Global served
on Pete, as class representative, a set
of interrogatories. One asked: "State
the factual basis for your contention in
paragraph 3 of the class action com-
plaint that Global's pilot of Flight 101
flew the plane in a negligent manner."
Pete objected to this interrogatory and
Global moved to compel an answer.
Which of the following is the most cor-
rect ruling on Global's motion?

B. This interrogatory requires the
attorney for the class to evalu-
ate facts in light of his legal
knowledge and, therefore, is
objectionable as calling for
that attorney's mental impres-
sions which are protected under
F.R.C.P. 26(b)(3).

C. This interrogatory is objection-
able because it is overbroad.

D. This interrogatory calls for the
opinion of experts in air disas-
ters who have been employed
by the class to prepare the case
in anticipation of litigation and,
therefore, calls for informa-
tion protected under F.R.C.P.
26(b)(4).

29. To which of the following information
is Pete not entitled under the mandatory
("required") disclosure rules?

A. Any liability insurance policy
held by Global for inspection and
copying.

B. The identity of any trial ex-

A. This interrogatory is allowed by

perts.

F.R.C.P. 33.

C. The identity of each individual
likely to have discoverable in-
formation relevant to issues
alleged with particularity in the
pleadings.

D. The identity of each trial wit-

ness. 

70 CIVIL PROCEDURE

30. Pete examined the captain of the plane
by oral deposition. In response to a
question asking whether he had been
drinking prior to take-off, the captain
replied: "Yes." Pete wants to know what
use he can make of this portion of the
captain's deposition transcript at trial.
Which of the following answers is most
nearly correct?

A. The deposition is inadmissible
for any purpose under the hear-
say rule.

B. The deposition is admissible
only to impeach the captain in
the instance that he testifies that
he had nothing to drink prior to
take-off.

C. The deposition is admissible
to help prove plaintiffs' case of
negligence as well as to impeach
the captain in the instance that
he testifies that he had nothing
to drink prior to take-off.

D. The deposition is admissible to
conclusively establish that the
captain had been drinking prior
to take-off thereby removing that
issue from the case and prevent-
ing the captain from testifying to
the contrary.

31. Immediately after Flight 101 crashed,
Global asked Prof, a professor of aero-
nautical engineering who lived near San
Diego Airport, to investigate the wreck-
age. Global sent Prof to the crash site
for the purpose of determining whether
he would make a good trial witness.
Prof spent two hours investigating the
wreckage and wrote a five-page report
concluding that pilot error was the sole
cause of the crash. Prof was paid an
agreed honorarium of $200 and was
never contacted by Global again. Pete,
as class representative, demands a copy
of Prof's report to Global through the
appropriate method. Global objects
and Pete moves to compel production
of the report. Which of the following
rulings on Pete's motion is most nearly
correct?

A. The report should be produced,
only if Pete can show a substan-
tial need for it and an inability
to get the substantial equivalent
of the report's contents without
undue hardship.

B. The report should be produced,
because its contents are relevant
to the subject matter and it was
not prepared in anticipation of
litigation.

C. The report should be produced,
only if Pete can show excep-
tional circumstances. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE

D. The report should not be pro-
duced under any circumstances,
because Prof is an informally
consulted expert.

32. Pete served a notice of deposition on
Mack, an employee of Global who
works in Global's Accident Preven-
tion Department. Mack has a degree
in mechanical engineering and was the
person who first examined the wreck-
age of Flight 101 immediately after the
crash to determine the cause of the crash
as part of his accident prevention duties.
Two months later, Mack was assigned
to Global's legal team as an expert
whose duties were to re-examine the
wreckage to assist Global's attorneys
in the preparation of Global's defense
to Pete's lawsuit. Mack will not testify
for Global at trial. Global moved for a
protective order that Mack's deposition
not take place. Global argued that Mack
is a non-testifying expert who Global
specially employed in preparation for
trial and, therefore, Pete needs to make
a showing of "exceptional circumstanc-
es" under which it is impracticable for
Pete to obtain Mack's facts and opinions
by other means. Pete responds that he
wants to question Mack solely about
the facts acquired by Mack during his
initial examination of the wreckage
immediately after the crash. Which of
the following rulings is most nearly
correct?

72 CIVIL PROCEDURE

A. Global's motion should be grant-
ed, but only if Pete can show
substantial need for Mack's de-
position and that Pete is unable
without undue hardship to obtain
the substantial equivalent of the
information known to Mack by
other means.

B. Global's motion should be de-
nied, because Mack is an or-
dinary percipient witness with
respect to the facts sought to be
discovered by Pete on deposi-
tion.

C. Global's motion should be de-
nied, but only if Pete can show
exceptional circumstances for
deposing Mack.

D. Global's motion should be grant-
ed, because the facts Pete seeks
to discover on Mack's deposition
are irrelevant to the subject mat-
ter of the lawsuit.

33. Whit, a mechanic employed by the San
Diego Airport, witnessed the crash of
Flight 101. Knowing that Global would
likely be facing a lawsuit by the injured
passengers, Whit sent Global's lawyers
a signed note recounting what he had
observed. Pete seeks to discover this
note and Global objects. On a motion by
Pete to compel production of the note,
which of the following rulings is most
nearly correct? 

Q

-CP
0 0
-
<
-

C

A. The note is discoverable, because
it is relevant to the subject mat-
ter.

B. The note is not discoverable,
because Whit's status as an ex-
pert mechanic protects the note,
under F.R.C.P. 26(b)(4).

C. The note is not discoverable,
because it is a written witness
statement that is protected as
ordinary work product.

D. The note is not discoverable,
because it is protected under the
attorney-client privilege.

34. The class action went to trial and the
plaintiff class won. Judgment was en-
tered for the class. Opie had previously
opted-out of the class action. However,
in response to the class action notice
that he had received from Pete, Opie
brought a personal injury suit against
Global in California superior court for
damages arising out of the air crash.
After judgment had been entered for
the class in the federal class action
suit, Opie moved for partial summary
judgment requesting the court to order
that, based upon the federal class action
judgment, it is conclusively established
in Opie's suit that Global was liable in
negligence to Opie (leaving only dam-
ages to be determined). Which of the
following statements is not correct?

A. If the case law of the Federal
Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit clearly forbids plaintiffs
who opt out of a class actions
from using collateral estoppel
offensively but California state
case law does allow such plain-
tiffs to use collateral estoppel
offensively, the California court
could not grant Opie's motion.

B. The Due Process Clause forbids
Opie from invoking collateral es-
toppel against Global in reliance
upon the class action judgment.

C. If the California state court
determined that Opie had been
motivated to opt-out in order to
"wait and see" whether the class
action turned out to be success-
ful, the court would likely deny
Opie's motion.

D.

If the federal courts still applied a
strict mutuality of estoppel rule,
the California court could not
grant Opie's motion.

35. A bill is pending before Congress to
deter sexual harassment in the work-
place. You clerk for a U.S. Senator and
an issue has arisen whether juries or
judges should determine fact issues in
trials involving lawsuits brought under
the new Act. Which of the following
versions of the statute will violate the
Seventh Amendment? 

CIVIL PROCEDURE

73

Q

IV. The statute creates a com-
prehensive federal regu-
latory program intended
to stop sexual harass-
ment in the workplace
and permits the federal
government to bring suit
against violators before
the federal Sexual Ha-
rassment Agency seek-
ing the imposition of
fines. All actions brought
under the statute shall
be tried before the fed-
eral Sexual Harassment
Agency.

A. I only.

B. II only.

C. II and III only.

D. II, III and IV only. 

I. The statute creates a new
private right of action
for sexual harassment,
allows both injunctive
relief and damages, and
provides that all issues
of fact will be tried by a
judge without regard to
the remedy sought.

II. The statute creates a new
private right of action
for sexual harassment,
allows both injunctive
relief and damages, and
provides that all ques-
tions of fact shall be
tried by a jury without
regard to the remedy
demanded.

III. The statute creates a new
private right of action
for sexual harassment,
allows both injunctive
relief and damages, and
is silent on the issue of
who shall be the trier of
fact, judge or jury.

74 CIVIL PROCEDURE

Questions 36 - 43 are based upon
the following facts.

On April 1, 1992, Hack, an unsuccessful
and unknown composer of popular songs,
brought a copyright infringement suit in
federal court against the world-famous
composer, Cole Sporter. Hack alleged that
many of Sporter's most famous songs - Be-
gin the Levine, My Heart Belongs to Laddie
and DeLightful DeLorian - were copied by
Sporter from Hack's tunes.

36. Following the service of the sum-
mons and complaint, and at Hack's request,
Sporter engaged in settlement discussions
with Hack for six weeks before Hack, with-
out indicating any previous intent to do so,
filed with the court a motion for default
judgment. The court granted Hack's motion.
Sporter then moved to set aside the default
judgment under F.R.C.P. 60(b). Which of the
following rulings is most nearly correct?

A. The default judgment should
be set aside, because Sporter's
act of entering into settlement
negotiations shows that he was
not in default.

B. The default judgment should
be set aside, because Sporter's
act of entering into settlement
negotiations constitutes an ap-
pearance by Sporter.

C. The default judgment should not
be set aside, because Hack prop-
erly sought the default judgment
before the judge rather than the
clerk.  

D. The default judgment should not
be set aside, because Sporter's
conduct clearly indicated his
intent to avoid complying with
orderly judicial procedures.

37. Assume, for purposes of this and suc-
ceeding questions, that the court set
aside the default judgment and that
Sporter served an answer to the com-
plaint denying the operative allegations
of the complaint. Shortly thereafter,
Hack filed a notice of dismissal and
Sporter moved to quash and vacate
the notice of dismissal. Which of the
following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. The motion should be denied, be-
cause Sporter had not yet moved
for summary judgment.

B. The motion should be granted,
because Sporter had previously
answered the complaint.

C. The motion should be denied,
because the action had not pro-
ceeded to the point where Sporter
would be prejudiced.

D. The motion should be granted,
because plaintiffs never have
an absolute right to voluntarily
dismiss their own actions.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

75

Q

38. Assume, for purposes of this and suc-
ceeding questions, that the court granted
Sporter's motion to quash in question
37. Sporter moved for summary judg-
ment. He attached to his moving papers
the sheet music of Sporter's songs
that he allegedly copied and Hack's
songs from which Sporter allegedly
copied. Hack responded by submitting
his complaint. The court believes that
Hack's songs and Sporter's songs are
so dissimilar that they do not indicate
copying by Sporter. Which of the fol-
lowing rulings is most nearly correct?

39. Assume, for purposes of this and
succeeding questions, that the court
denied Sporter's motion for summary
judgment. The court held a pre-trial
conference. The pre-trial order that
resulted from the conference specified
copyright infringement under the Fed-
eral Copyright Act as Hack's only cause
of action. On the third day of trial, Hack
wanted to amend the pre-trial order to
add certain state common law claims.
Which of the following statements is
most nearly correct?

A. The motion should be granted,
because the songs are so dis-
similar that the court does not
believe they indicate copying by
Sporter.

B. The motion should be denied,
because Sporter did not meet his
movant's burden.

C. The motion should be granted,
because Hack did not meet his
respondent's burden.

D. The motion should be granted,
because the absence of affidavits
or deposition testimony means
there are no credibility issues to
resolve.

A. Hack has a right to amend the
pre-trial order to add another
related cause of action.

B. Hack may amend the pre-trial
order provided he can show
exceptional circumstances for
doing so.

C. Leave of court to allow plaintiffs
to amend the pre-trial order shall,
as a matter of policy, be freely
granted.

D. Leave of court to amend the pre-
trial order shall be granted only
to prevent manifest injustice. 

76 CIVIL PROCEDURE

40. Assume, for purposes of this and suc-
ceeding questions, that the court did not
approve amendment of the pleadings
to add state common law claims. The
case went to trial. An essential element
of Hack's infringement case is to show
that Sporter had access to Hack's songs.
Hack's sole evidence on this element
was Hack's own testimony that Sporter
broke into his house on the night of June
15, 1989 and took pictures of Hack's
musical manuscripts with a special
"spy" camera. In rebuttal, Sporter testi-
fied that he was 1000 miles away from
Hack's home on the night of June 15,
1989. In addition, four disinterested
witnesses each testified for Sporter that
they had heard from someone with per-
sonal knowledge that Sporter had been
1,000 miles away from Hack's house
on the night in question. At the close
of all the evidence, Sporter moved for
a judgment as a matter of law. Which
of the following rulings is most nearly
correct?

A. The court should grant the mo-
tion, because Sporter's case,
consisting of corroborated and
disinterested testimony, over-
whelms Hack's weak case on the
issue of access.

B. The court should deny the mo-
tion, because Sporter did not
make the motion before the close
of Hack's case.

C. The court should grant the mo-
tion, because Hack's testimony is
not credible as a matter of law.

D. The court should deny the mo-
tion, because the jury should
have the opportunity to deter-
mine the credibility of Hack's
testimony.

41. Assume, for purposes of this and suc-
ceeding questions, that the court denied
Sporter's motion in Question 40. The
jury rendered a verdict in favor of
Sporter. Hack moved for a new trial.
Hack submitted the affidavits of three
jurors each stating: (1) that each had
observed that Hack had shifted uncom-
fortably in his seat at plaintiff's counsel
table throughout the trial; and (2) that
Hack looked scared— which caused
each of the three jurors to believe that
Hack was lying on the stand. Which
of the following rulings is most nearly
correct?

A. The motion should be denied,
because, under F.R.E. 606(b), no
juror may testify to the effect of
anything upon his or any other
juror's mind.

B. The motion should be granted,
because what the jurors observed
in the courtroom amounted to ex-
traneous prejudicial information
improperly brought to the jury's
attention.

might otherwise not result.

43. On Hack's appeal, referred to in Ques-
tion 42, Sporter, as appellee, asked the
Court of Appeals to reverse the district
court's denial of Sporter's request for
attorney's fees. Which of the following
rulings by the Court of Appeals is most
nearly correct?

A. The error is not reviewable,
because Sporter is only an ap-
pellee.

B. The error is reviewable, because
Sporter had previously raised the
error in the district court.

C. The error is reviewable, because
Sporter is not attacking the trial
judge on the underlying merits
of the court's judgment in favor
of Sporter (on Hack's copyright
claim).

D. The error is not reviewable, be-

cause it is harmless error.

C. The motion should be denied, be-
cause the jurors' three affidavits
contained no evidence of jury
misconduct.

D. The motion should be denied,
because even if the jurors had
engaged in jury misconduct, that
misconduct could not be deemed
prejudicial.

42. Assume, for purposes of this and suc-
ceeding questions, that Hack's new trial
motion was denied. Hack appealed rais-
ing for the first time the objection to the
admission into evidence of the hearsay
testimony of the "four disinterested
witnesses" referred to in Question 40.
Which of the following rulings by the
Court of Appeals is most nearly cor-
rect?

A. The objection is not reviewable,
because Hack did not raise it in
the trial court.

B. The objection is not reviewable,
because the trial judge commit-
ted the error during the middle of
the trial; therefore, it is interlocu-
tory.

C. The objection is reviewable,
because if the testimony was
hearsay, it could have prejudiced
the verdict.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

Questions 44 - 47 are based upon
the following facts:

Pat, a Californian, Dan, a Nevadan, and
Dave, an Arizonan, were involved in a
three-way collision. On January 1, 1990, Pat
sued Dan and Dave for negligence demand-
ing $55,000 in property damage to her car.
Dan and Dave each denied the allegations
in Pat's complaint and Dan and Dave each
asserted Pat's contributory negligence as
an affirmative defense to Pat's claims. Dan
cross-claimed against Dave for property
damage in the amount of $500. Dave as-
serted contributory negligence as an affirma-
tive defense to Dan's cross-claim. Assume,
for purposes of the foregoing questions, that
contributory negligence is an absolute bar
to recovery.

44. After a trial, the jury rendered a gen-
eral verdict for Dan and Dave on Pat's
claims, and a general verdict for Dan
on Dan's cross-claim against Dave.
Judgment was then entered on each of
these verdicts on June 1, 1990. Dan then
brought a negligence suit against Pat
for personal injury claiming $5,000 in
damages. Pat's answer asserted Dan's
contributory negligence against Pat as
an affirmative defense to Dan's claim.
Pat moved for summary judgment to
dismiss Dan's claim relying on the June
1, 1990 judgment in Pat v. Dan and
Dave. Under the traditional common
law, which of the following rulings is
correct?

A. If Pat v. Dan and Dave had been
brought in a state court following
the traditional common law ap-
proach to counterclaims, but Dan
v. Pat had been brought in fed-
eral court, Pat's summary judg-
ment motion should be granted
because Dan's claim arises out
of the same transaction or oc-
currence as Pat's claim against
Dan.

B. If Pat v. Dan and Dave had been
brought in a state court fol-
lowing the traditional common
law approach to counterclaims,
Pat's summary judgment mo-
tion should be granted because
Dan's claim arises out of the
same transaction or occurrence
as Pat's claim against Dan.

C. If Pat v. Dan and Dave had been
brought in a state court fol-
lowing the traditional common
law approach to counterclaims,
Pat's summary judgment motion
should be granted because Dan's
claim arises out of the same set
of operative facts as Dan's con-
tributory negligence affirmative
defense in Pat v. Dan.

D. If Pat v. Dan and Dave had been
brought in a state court fol-
lowing the traditional common
law approach to counterclaims,
Pat's summary judgment motion
should be denied.

45. Assume that the court denied Pat's mo-
tion for summary judgment in Question
44. Dan moved for partial summary
judgment on Pat's affirmative defense.
He requested that the court find conclu-
sively that Dan was not contributorily
negligent based upon the June 1, 1990
judgment in Pat v. Dan and Dave.
Which of the following rulings is most
nearly correct?

A. Dan's motion should be denied
because the general verdict for
Dan against Pat, on Pat's claim
against Dan, prevents Dan from
proving that the jury actually
determined that Dan was not
negligent.

B. Dan's motion should be granted
because the jury in Pat v. Dan
and Dave actually and necessar-
ily determined that Dan was not
negligent.

C. Dan's motion should be denied
because the jury's findings of
fact in Pat v. Dan and Dave are
unreliable. Their verdicts for
Dave against Pat (on Pat's claim)
and for Dan against Dave (on
Dan's cross-claim) are hope-
lessly irreconcilable.

D. Dan's motion should be denied
because Pat did not have a full
and fair opportunity to litigate
the issue of Dan's negligence.

80 CIVIL PROCEDURE

46. Assume that Pat v. Dan and Dave had
been brought in federal district court
(properly invoking diversity jurisdic-
tion). Dan sued Dave in state court for
personal injury claiming $60,000 in
damages. Assume the res judicata law
followed by the jurisdiction in which
the state court sits (in Dan v. Dave)
applies the "primary rights" definition
of "cause of action." Dave moved for
summary judgment to dismiss Dan's
claim in reliance on the June 1, 1990
judgment in Pat v. Dan and Dave.
Which of the following rulings is most
nearly correct?

A. Dave's motion should be granted,
because Dan violated the cross-
claim rule of F.R.C.P. 13(g) by
failing to join his personal injury
claim against Dan with his prop-
erty damage claim.

B. Dave's motion should be granted,
because Dan's claim for personal
injury is part of the same cause
of action as Dan's cross-claim
against Dave for property dam-
age.

C. Dave's motion should be denied,
because there are no compulsory
cross-claims in federal court.

D. Dave's motion should be de-
nied, because Dan sued Dave
in state court, which follows the
"primary rights" definition of
"cause of action" for res judicata
purposes. 

47. Assume, for purposes of this question,
that the court denied Dave's summary
judgment motion in Question 46. Dan
moved for partial summary judgment
requesting the court to find that it has
been conclusively established, by virtue
of the June 1, 1990 judgment in Pat v.
Dan and Dave, that Dave was negligent.
Which of the following rulings is most
nearly correct?

A. Dan's motion should be denied,
because the general verdict on
Dan's cross-claim against Dave,
in Pat v. Dan and Dave, prevents
Dan from showing what the jury
actually determined.

B. Dan's motion should be granted,
because the jury actually and
necessarily determined that Dave
was negligent and Dave had a
full and fair opportunity to liti-
gate that issue.

C. Dan's motion should be denied,
because Dave did not have a full
and fair opportunity to litigate
the issue of Dave's negligence.

D. Dan's motion should be denied,
because of the doctrine of mutu-
ality of estoppel.

Questions 48 - 50 are based upon
the following facts:

Pat claims ownership of Blackacre, located
in Wyoming, through adverse possession.
Paul is the owner of record and has a deed
bearing his (Paul's) name on file in the
County Recorder's office. Don came onto
Blackacre without Pat's or Paul's permis-
sion and cut down timber which Don hauled
away and sold.

48. Pat brought a trespass action against
Don in federal district court in Ne-
vada. Don's answer asserted, by way
of defense, that the Nevada statute of
limitations on trespass had run. Don
then brought a pre-answer motion to
dismiss Pat's case on statute of limita-
tions grounds, which the court granted.
Pat brought another trespass action
against Don in the federal district court
in Wyoming where the statute of limita-
tions on trespass is long enough to allow
Pat to seek to enforce her claim in a
Wyoming court. Don's answer asserted
the following by way of defense against
Pat's claim: (1) that Pat did not own
Blackacre; (2) that Don did not come
upon Blackacre and cut the timber, and
(3) that Pat's claim is barred by res judi-
cata. Don then moved to dismiss Pat's
suit on grounds of res judicata. Which
of the following is the most likely ruling
of the court (for either Pat or Don)? 

CIVIL PROCEDURE

81

LU
ce

—>
0 0

A. The court should grant Don's
motion, because Pat has previ-
ously sued Don on the same
cause of action in the Nevada
court and the Nevada federal
court rendered a final judgment
on the merits.

B. The court should deny Don's mo-
tion, because the Nevada federal
court's judgment was not ren-
dered after a hearing based upon
evidence and, therefore, was not
a judgment on the merits.

C. The court should deny Don's mo-
tion, because the Nevada federal
court's judgment is not deemed
to be on the merits as long as
Wyoming allows Pat to take
advantage of its longer statute of
limitations.

D. The court should grant Don's
motion, because the Nevada
federal court has already made a
final determination that Pat's ac-
tion is barred by Nevada's statute
of limitations.

82 CIVIL PROCEDURE

49. Assume, for the purpose of this and suc-
ceeding questions, that the court denied
Don's motion in question 48. After a
trial, in which evidence was admitted on
both of Don's defenses (i.e., that Pat did
not own Blackacre and that Don did not
come onto Blackacre), the jury rendered
a general verdict for Don and the court
thereupon entered judgment for Don
on June 1, 1990. Pat then sued Don for
conversion in a Wyoming federal court
to recover the value of the trees which
Don allegedly cut down and sold. Don
asserted, in his answer, the defense
of res judicata and moved to dismiss
Pat's suit on that ground. Which of the
following is the most likely ruling (for
either Pat or Don)?

A. The court should grant Don's
motion, because the conversion
and trespass are part of the same
transaction or occurrence.

B. The court should deny Don's
motion, because conversion and
trespass are different transac-
tions.

C. The court should deny Don's
motion, because conversion and
trespass are based upon different
wrongful acts by Don.

D. The court should deny Don's mo-
tion, because Pat's conversion
and trespass claims involve sub-
stantially the same evidence.

Q

50. Assume, for purpose of this question,
that the court granted Don's motion
in question 49 and dismissed Pat's
conversion suit against Don. Paul,
the record owner of Blackacre, then
brought a trespass suit against Don in
federal court in Wyoming. Don moved
for partial summary judgment, asking
the court to find that it has been con-
clusively established, by the June 1,
1990 judgment in Pat v. Don, that Don
did not come upon Blackacre. Which is
the most nearly correct ruling (for either
Paul or Don)?

A. The court should grant Don's
motion because the jury, in Pat
v. Don, has already determined
that Don did not come upon
Blackacre.

B. The court should deny Don's mo-
tion because Don cannot show
that the jury, in Pat v. Don, actu-
ally determined that he did not
come upon Blackacre.

C. The court should deny Don's
motion because, whether or not
the jury actually determined that
Don did not come upon Black-
acre, Paul was not a party in the
Pat v. Don suit.

D. The court should deny Don's
motion, because the doctrine of
mutuality of estoppel prevents
Don from invoking collateral
estoppel against a stranger to the
Pat v. Don suit.

Questions 51 - 55 are based on the
following facts:

Paul was driving his two year old "Flexus"
automobile on the Riverside Freeway when
the engine suddenly quit and the car slowed
down to a stop before Paul could steer the
vehicle to the shoulder of the road. Conse-
quently, Paul's car was rear-ended, causing
injury to the car and to Paul. Paul brought
a products liability suit in federal district
court against the Flexus Motor Company, the
manufacturer of Paul's car. The complaint
alleged, in pertinent part, that Paul's car
was defectively designed and manufactured,
without specifying the nature of the defects,
and that said defects were the proximate
cause of injury to Paul and his car.

51. Flexus did not make a pre-answer mo-
tion, but filed and served a timely an-
swer to Paul's complaint. In addition to
denying the allegations of Paul's com-
plaint, the answer stated, as a defense,
that the allegations regarding the car's
defects were vague and conclusionary
and, because they were central to Paul's
products liability claim, the complaint
should be dismissed. On a motion by
Flexus to dismiss the complaint, which
of the following statements is most
nearly correct?

A. The motion should be granted
because "defect" allegations,
going to the heart of Paul's prod-
ucts defect claim, should at least
notify Flexus of the particular
parts of the car alleged to have
been defective. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 83

Q

B. The motion should be denied
because the "defect" allegations
are adequately pleaded.

C. The motion should be denied
because Flexus should have
attacked the sufficiency of the
allegations in Paul's complaint
through a pre-answer motion
under Rule 12(b)(6).

D. The motion should be denied
because Flexus waived any ob-
jection to the sufficiency of the
complaint when it responded to
the complaint's allegations by
denying them.

84 CIVIL PROCEDURE

52. Assume, for purposes of the rest of this
series of questions, that Flexus' motion
in question 51 was denied. Shortly
thereafter, the parties met as required
by Rule 26(f), in part, to arrange for
the "disclosures" required under Rule
26(a)(1). At this conference, Paul in-
sisted that Flexus had an obligation,
under Rule 26(a)(1), to "disclose" to
Paul all persons possibly involved in,
and all documents affecting, the design,
manufacture, and assembly of the same
model and year of Flexus car Paul was
driving. Flexus adamantly refused and
asked Paul to identify more particularly
the parts of Paul's car that were defec-
tive. Paul argued that it was too early
in the case to do so. Paul then moved
for sanctions against Flexus under
Rule 37(a) for failure to comply with
its "disclosure" obligations. Which of
the following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. Paul's motion should be granted
because Paul is not required,
early in his case, to know the
particulars of his case against
Flexus.

B. Paul's motion should be denied
because Flexus did not violate its
"disclosure" obligations under
Rule 26(a).

C. Paul's motion should be granted
because Flexus did violate its
"disclosure" obligations under
Rule 26(a). 

'CP

C7

D. Paul's motion should be denied
because Paul's discovery request
called for irrelevant informa-
tion.

53. Paul sought to depose Egbert, an expert
who was retained by Flexus to provide
expert testimony on behalf of Flexus
at trial. After being retained by Flexus,
Egbert inspected the wreckage of the
automobile after it had been towed
away by the police. Flexus moved for
a protective order to bar the deposition
of Egbert. Which of the following state-
ments is most nearly correct?

A. Flexus' motion should be granted
because Paul should hire his own
expert to inspect the wreckage.

B. Flexus's motion should be
granted because Paul failed
first to serve the required inter-
rogatories described in Rule
26(b)(4)(a)(i).

C. Flexus' motion should be granted
because the facts and opinions of
Flexus' expert are protected by
the work product immunity.

D. Flexus' motion should be de-

nied.

54. Six months later, Paul narrowed the de-
fect that he alleges caused the engine in
his car to quit to a defect in the design of
the fuel injection system. Immediately
thereafter, Flexus sent to Paul a list
identifying all Flexus employees who
had been involved with the design of
the fuel injection system in question and
describing by category and location all
documents in the possession, custody
and control of Flexus relating to the
design of that fuel injection system. On
motion against Flexus for sanctions,
Paul asserts that Flexus was obligated
by the "disclosure" requirements of
Rule 26(a) to provide Paul with actual
copies of these documents, not merely
a description. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. Flexus is not obligated, under
the "disclosure" rules, to pro-
vide copies of the documents in
question as long as it provides a
description of the documents by
category and location.

B. The "disclosure" rules only al-
low Flexus to provide Paul with
a description of the documents
in question, but not copies; to
obtain copies, Paul must serve
on Flexus a formal request under
Rule 34. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE

85

C. Flexus' motion should be granted
because the identity of Paul's
trial witnesses is relevant in-
formation and is not protected
from discovery as Paul's trial
strategy.

D. Flexus' motion should be granted
because Paul is obligated to pro-
vide this information to Flexus
under the "disclosure" rules.

Q

C. By providing Paul with a de-
scription of the documents in
question, pursuant to the "disclo-
sure" rules, Flexus has waived
its right to object to production
of those documents on the basis
of privilege and work product
protection.

D. Flexus is obligated, under the
"disclosure" rules, to provide
copies of the documents in ques-
tion.

55. Twenty days before the commencement
of trial, Flexus had not received a list of
Paul's trial witnesses. Flexus told Paul
by telephone and letter that he was ob-
ligated by Rule 26(a) to "disclose" this
information but Paul adamantly refused.
Flexus moved for sanctions under Rule
37(a) and included a certification that
it had attempted to confer with Paul in
an effort to secure disclosure without
court action. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. Flexus' motion should be denied
because Paul's trial strategy
constitutes mental impressions
and, as such, are protected from
discovery.

B. Flexus' motion should be denied
because Flexus should have
sought this information by serv-
ing a formal interrogatory. 

86 CIVIL PROCEDURE

Questions 56 - 59 are based on the
following facts:

Pete and Joe moved into a rental apartment,
owned by Larry Lessor, on January 1, 1992.
The rent was $500 a month, to be paid on the
first of each month. On December 1, 1991,
Larry had mailed an original and a copy of
the lease to Pete and Joe with a space for
the signatures of Pete and Joe, respectively.
On December 15, 1991, Larry received the
original by mail and it contained signatures
purporting to be both Pete's and Joe's. On
June 1, 1992, Larry brought suit against Pete
and Joe claiming Pete and Joe failed to pay
rent for March and April and demanding
$1000, the rent for those two months.

Q

56. Before filing an answer, Joe immedi-
ately moved for summary judgment to
dismiss the claim against him on the
grounds that the signature on the lease
purporting to be his is a forgery and that
he did not sign the lease. In support of
his motion, Joe submitted the follow-
ing evidence: (1) his affidavit swearing
that he did not sign the lease; (2) the
affidavits of 10 handwriting experts
who, based upon a comparison of the
signature on the lease with signatures
on 25 checks drawn on Joe's account
(each of which "cleared"), each affirm
that the signature on the lease is a plain
forgery; (3) an affidavit by Joe's prior
landlord that he was familiar with Joe's
signature and that the signature on the
lease is a forgery and (4) the copy with
no signature in the space reserved for
Joe's signature. In response, Larry sub-
mitted no affidavits or other evidence
but argues in his Memo of Points and
Authorities that the court should deny
the motion because he may be able to
show, at trial, that Joe signed the lease.
There were no eyewitnesses to Joe's
signing of the lease. Assume the rules
and case law relating to summary judg-
ment are those applicable in federal
court. Which of the following states the
most appropriate disposition of Joe's
motion (for either side)?

A. Joe's motion should be granted
because Larry did not meet his
respondent's burden. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE

87

A. Pete's motion should be denied
because he did not submit any
evidence to support his movant's
burden.

B. Pete's motion should be denied
because each monthly obligation
to pay rent constitutes a separate
"cause of action."

C. Pete's motion should be granted
because Larry split his cause of
action.

D. Pete's motion should be granted
because Larry did not meet his
respondent's burden.

58. Assume, for purposes of this series of
questions, that the court granted Pete's
summary judgment motion referred
to in Question 57. Larry, immediately
thereafter, commenced a second suit
against Joe for the "May" rent. Joe
moved for summary judgment citing
the summary judgment in his favor in
Larry v. Joe. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. The court should grant Joe's
motion because Larry did not
include Joe in his suit against
Pete for the May rent, and Larry,
having lost his suit against Pete
for the May rent, cannot now
come after Joe. 

B. Joe's motion should be denied
because Joe did not meet his
movant's burden.

C. Joe's motion should be denied
because he did not previously
serve and file an answer before
moving for summary judgment.

D. Joe's motion should be denied
because Joe did not negate every
possible way that Larry might
prove that Joe had signed the
lease.

57. Assume, for the remainder of this series
of questions, that the court granted Joe's
motion for summary judgment and dis-
missed Larry's claims against Joe. Pete
answered Larry's complaint, admitting
failure to pay the March and April rent
but asserting as a defense Larry's failure
to repair the heater which provides heat
to the apartment and hot water. Assume
that, if proved, this would state a valid
defense to payment of rent under appli-
cable substantive law. At trial, evidence
was presented on both sides of the issue
of the repair of the water heater and the
judge, as trier of fact, found that the
heater had been repaired and found for
Larry. Judgment was entered for Larry
on August 1, 1992. On August 15, 1992,
Larry brought another suit against Pete
for alleged failure to pay the May rent.
Pete moved for summary judgment cit-
ing the prior judgment in Larry v. Pete.
Which of the following statements is
most nearly correct?

88 CIVIL PROCEDURE

B. The court should grant Joe's
motion because, in the prior suit
against Joe, Larry only asserted
a claim for the March and April
rent, and omitted the May rent.

C. The court should grant Joe's
motion because the court, in the
prior suit against Joe, found that
Joe had not signed the lease.

D. B and C.

59. Assume, for purposes of this series of
questions, that the court denied Joe's
motion referred to in Question 58. Joe
answered Larry's complaint, denying
the allegations therein and asserting,
as a defense, that the water heater had
broken down again in May and that
Larry failed to repair it. Larry moved
for partial summary judgment to strike
Joe's defense regarding the water heater
citing the prior judgment for Larry en-
tered August 1, 1992. Which of the fol-
lowing statements is the best answer?

A. Larry's motion should be denied
because Joe did not have his day
in court on the issue of the bro-
ken water heater.

B. Larry's motion should be granted
because (assuming Joe is found
to have signed the lease and that
he is jointly liable as a cotenant
to Larry for the full amount of
the rent) Joe is in privity with
Pete and is, therefore, bound by
the judgment for Larry entered
August 1, 1992.

C. Larry's motion should be denied
because mutuality of estoppel
prevents Larry from invoking
collateral against a stranger to
the Larry v. Pete suit.

D. Larry's motion should be denied
because the issue of the state of
the water heater in May is not
necessarily identical with the
state of the water heater in March
and April.

Questions 60 - 64 are based upon
the following facts:

D. Pat's motion should be granted

61. Lou, Plucky's lawyer, tracked down
Wally, another witness to Pat's acci-
dent and got a written statement from
Wally. Pat properly served on Plucky's
a discovery demand for Wally's state-
ment. Plucky's objected and Pat moved
to compel production. Which of the
following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. Wally's statement is not discov-

the attorney-client privilege .

B. Wally's statement is not discov-
erable because it is protected by
the work product immunity.

C. Wally's statement is not discov-

Pat slipped on the floor in a Plucky's Su-
permarket in Anaheim Hills. Pat brought
suit against Plucky's in federal district court
(assume jurisdiction exists) for personal
injury.

60. Pat's friend, Joe, who accompanied
Pat to the market and claims to have
seen what happened, gave a written
statement to Sam, the store manager,
immediately after Pat slipped on the
supermarket floor. Neither Pat nor
Joe had a copy of Joe's statement. Pat
properly served on Plucky's a discov-

Plucky's objected to producing Joe's
statement on work product grounds, Pat
moved to compel production. Which of
the following statements is most nearly

Q

62. In response to a different "slip and fall"
incident that occurred a year prior to
Pat's accident, Plucky's President re-
tained Ed, a safety expert, to examine
Plucky's Anaheim Hills store for poten-
tial safety hazards and to make recom-
mendations for preventing future ac-
cidents. Ed drafted a memo containing
his findings and recommendations and
sent it to Plucky's President. Although
Pat's case has not yet reached the trial
phase, because the parties are still in
discovery, Plucky's lawyer knows that
Ed's memo would not be admissible
evidence at trial under the evidence
law known as the "subsequent reme-
dial measures" exclusionary rule. This
rule bars the admission into evidence
at trial of measures taken by a party to
remedy a dangerous situation to prove
negligence. The rule is concerned that
parties would be deterred from taking
such remedial measures. Pat properly
served on Plucky's a discovery demand
for Ed's memo. Plucky's objected
and Pat moved to compel production.
Which of the following statements is
most nearly correct?

A. Ed's memo is not discoverable
because it contains the mental
impressions of an expert.

B. Ed's memo is not discoverable
because the purpose of the memo
is to avoid future litigation.

C. Ed's memo is discoverable.

D. Ed's memo is not discoverable
because it is protected by the
"subsequent remedial measures"
rule.

63. Pat seeks to discover a report by a city
Health Department officer regarding
fruits and vegetables which he found on
the floors of all Plucky's Supermarkets
— including the Anaheim Hills store.
Plucky's objected and Pat moved to
compel production of the report. Which
of the following statements is most
nearly correct?

A. The report is not discoverable

because it is irrelevant.

B. The report is not discoverable

because it is confidential.

C. The report is not discoverable

lawyer. On oral deposition of Sam by
Pat, Pat's lawyer asked Sam the follow-
ing question: "Describe the condition
of the floor where Pat fell at the time
you arrived at the scene of Pat's ac-
cident." Plucky's counsel objected and
Pat moved to compel Sam to answer.

Owner, a New Yorker, contracted with Gen-
eral, a California general contractor, to build
a house for Owner in Anaheim, California.
Owner had previously hired Archie, a New
York architect, to draw up the plans for the
house. Owner gave these plans to General
who relied upon them in building the house.
When the house was completed, Owner
found that the house started to sink. Owner
brought suit in federal court for $80,000
in damages, jointly and severally, against
(1) General, for defectively constructing
the house, and (2) the City of Anaheim for
negligently allowing the reservoir adjacent
to Owner's house to leak water, causing the
ground underneath the house to give way.

65. The two defendants moved to dismiss
the complaint for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, contending that the amount
in controversy was insufficient since
$80,000 split between two defendants
was only $40,000 per defendant. There-
fore, each claim lacked the requisite
jurisdictional amount. Which of the
following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. The court has subject matter ju-
risdiction because the two claims
arise out of the same transaction
and occurrence.

B. The court has subject matter ju-
risdiction because the court can
aggregate the two claims. 

92 CIVIL PROCEDURE

C. The court has subject matter ju-
risdiction because the damages
were pleaded against the defen-
dants jointly and severally.

D. The court does not have subject

matter jurisdiction.

66. Assume, for purposes of the remainder
of this series of questions, that the court
denied the motions in Question 65.
The City of Anaheim counterclaimed
against Owner for $10,000 which it
claimed was a special city tax assess-
ment for the building of the reservoir
which Owner should have paid (but
didn't) when he purchased the land
upon which his house was built. Owner
filed and served a Reply which asserted,
as an affirmative defense, that the tax
assessment violated his rights under the
14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitu-
tion. Owner moved to dismiss the City's
counterclaim. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. The court should grant the mo-
tion to dismiss because of lack
of subject matter jurisdiction.

B. The court should deny the mo-
tion to dismiss because federal
courts can exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over compulsory
counterclaims.

C. The court should deny the mo-
tion because the court has federal
question jurisdiction over the
counterclaim.  

D. The court should deny the mo-
tion because a municipality can
always sue a citizen in federal
court.

67. General asserted a cross-claim for con-

The City of Anaheim moved to dismiss
the cross-claim. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. The court should grant the mo-
tion to dismiss because a claim
for contribution or indemnity
can only be joined by means of
impleader.

B. The court should grant the
motion to dismiss because the
cross-claim is not supported by
an independent basis of subject
matter jurisdiction.

C. The court should deny the mo-
tion to dismiss because joinder
is proper.

D. The court should deny the mo-
tion to dismiss because the court
can exercise supplemental juris-
diction over the cross-claim.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 93

Q

68. Assume, for purposes of the remain-
der of this series of questions, that the
court denied the motion in Question
67. General served a timely third-party
complaint and summons on Archie,
the architect, claiming that Archie's
defective plans caused the house to
sink. As a result, General had to spend
$60,000 more on the project than he had
anticipated which caused General to
go bankrupt. Archie moved to dismiss
the third-party complaint. Which of the
following statements is most nearly cor-
rect?

A. The court should grant Archie's
motion because impleader is
improper.

B. The court should grant Archie's
motion because the impleader
of Archie, a New Yorker, would
destroy diversity.

C. The court should deny Archie's
motion because impleader is
proper.

D. The court should deny Archie's
motion because the court can ex-
ercise supplemental jurisdiction
over General's third-party claim
against Archie.

69. Assume, for purposes of the remain-
der of this series of questions, that the
court granted the motion in Question
68. General served a timely third-party
complaint and summons on Fred, a
California sub-contractor, who was
hired by General to lay the foundation
for Owner's house. The third-party
complaint contained two claims: In
Claim #1, General alleged that the
foundation was defectively laid and
this caused the house to sink. In Claim
#2, General alleged that Fred failed to
repay a loan General had made to Fred
in connection with another project. Fred
moved to dismiss both claims. Which of
the following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. The court should dismiss Claim

#2 but not Claim #1.

B. The court should dismiss Claim

#1 but not Claim #2.

C. The court should dismiss both

Claims.

D. The court should not dismiss

either Claim.

New Yorker, not a Californian. Owner
moved for leave to amend his complaint
to add a claim against Fred alleging that
Fred's defective laying of the founda-

71. Assume that, after a trial, judgment
was rendered in favor of Owner against
both General and the City of Anaheim
and appeals by each defendant failed.
Owner collected the full amount of his
judgment from the City of Anaheim.
The City of Anaheim sued General for
contribution, claiming reimbursement
in proportion to General's degree of
fault for the sinking house. General
moved to dismiss the City's suit. Which
of the following statements is most
nearly correct?

A. The motion should be denied
because Fred will be prejudiced
in having to defend against two
claims (General's and Owner's)
instead of only one claim (Gen-
eral's).

B. The motion should be granted
because Owner's claim against
Fred arises out of the same
transaction and occurrence as
his claims against General and
the City of Anaheim.

C. The motion should be denied,
otherwise, diversity will be de-
stroyed.

D. The motion should granted be-
cause Fred has waived his sub-
ject matter jurisdiction defense.

A. The motion to dismiss should
be granted because the City of
Anaheim should have counter-
claimed for contribution in the
previous suit by Owen against
General and the City of Ana-
heim.

B. The motion to dismiss should be
denied because cross-claims are
never compulsory.

C. The motion to dismiss should be
denied because when the City
of Anaheim failed to assert its
contribution claim in the previ-
ous suit, General failed to object
at that time, thereby waiving its
objection.

D. The motion to dismiss should
be granted because cross-claims
which arise out of the same
transaction and occurrence are
compulsory.

arise under federal law.

73. Under which category or categories
of class action does Joe's class action
fit?

A. "Prejudice" class action [Rule

23(b)(1)].

B. "Injunctive" class action [Rule

requirement applicable to Joe's class
action?

A. The best notice practicable under

the circumstances.

B. The best notice practicable under
the circumstances, including
individual notice to each class
member. 

Questions 72 - 76 are based on the
following facts:

Joe, a New Yorker, bought stock in the I.B.N.
Corporation, a Delaware Corporation with
its principal place of business in New York
City, on the basis of glowing reports in an
I.B.N. stock prospectus about a revolution-
ary new invention. Joe bought the stock at
$100 a share. When the Wall Street Journal
reported that I.B.N.'s reports regarding this
invention were false, the price of the stock
plummeted to $1.00 per share. Joe brought a
federal class action against I.B.N., on behalf
of himself and as representative of all others
who purchased I.B.N. stock in reliance on
the misleading prospectus, alleging violation
of the federal Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934. Joe alleged $10,000 in damages
and none of the 100,000 class members
individually had more than $6,000 in dam-
ages. The aggregate class damages exceeded
$3,000,000.

72. I.B.N. moved to dismiss Joe's claim and
those of the class on the grounds that
the federal court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. The court has no subject matter
jurisdiction because the damages
of Joe and the class members
may not be aggregated.

B. The court has no subject mat-
ter jurisdiction because Joe and
I.B.N. are both New York citi-
zens.

96 CIVIL PROCEDURE

C. The best notice practicable under
the circumstances, including
individual notice to all class
members who can be identified
through reasonable effort.

D. Publication of the class action
notice in newspapers of wide
circulation.

75. Assume for this question that Joe is also
an attorney and, in addition to class rep-
resentative, intends to serve as counsel
to the class. I.B.N. contends that this
fact makes Joe an inadequate class
representative. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. The court will find that Joe's sta-
tus as class attorney makes Joe
an inadequate class representa-
tive.

B. The court will find that Joe's sta-
tus as class attorney makes him
an adequate class representative
because it gives him an even
greater stake in the successful
outcome of the suit.

C. The court will find Joe's status
as class attorney makes him an
adequate class representative
because it will save the class the
cost of hiring a separate attor-
ney.

D. The court will find Joe's status
as class attorney to be irrelevant
to whether Joe will adequately
represent the class.

Q

76. Joe learns that mailing notice to the
class will cost $300,000. Joe has rep-
resented to the court that he has no
more than $10,000 to pay for notice to
the class. Which of the following best
describes how a court will handle this
situation?

A. Joe will have to pay the entire

$300,000 himself.

B. The court will order I.B.N. to pay
the $280,000 if it determines,
after a preliminary hearing, that
Joe is likely to win the class ac-
tion on the merits.

C. The court will scale down the
number of class members who
will receive individual notice and
authorize notice to the remain-
ing members by publication in a
newspapers of wide circulation.

D. The court will reduce the size
of the class until the cost of
mailing individual notice equals
$10,000.

experts].

78. Donna sought to depose Eggbert, an
expert in accident reconstruction, who
has been identified by Paula, pursuant
to disclosure requirements, as a wit-
ness she has retained to provide expert
testimony in the case. Donna wants to
depose Eggbert and has served upon
him a notice of deposition. Donna has
not yet served any interrogatories on
Paula, nor has she received any reports
prepared by Eggbert on his proposed
trial testimony. Paula moved for a pro-
tective order to prevent Donna from
proceeding with Eggbert's deposition.
Which of the following statements is
most nearly correct?

A. The protective order should be
granted because Donna has not
yet received any reports prepared
by Eggbert regarding his pro-
posed trial testimony.

B. The protective order should be
granted because Donna has not
yet served, and received answers
to, interrogatories regarding
Eggbert's proposed trial testi-
mony. 

Questions 77 - 79 are based on the
following facts:

Paul, an Oregonian, and Don, a Californian,
were each independent truckers who were
driving their respective trucks on a two-lane
highway and were approaching each other
from opposite directions. Their side-mir-
rors struck each other, causing each truck to
swerve off the highway killing each driver.
Paula, Paul's wife and executrix for Paul's
estate, brought suit in federal court against
Don's estate, represented by Don's wife
Donna as executrix, for wrongful death,
alleging that Don's truck had veered into
Paul's on-coming lane, thereby causing
the mirrors to come into contact. Assume
diversity of citizenship exists. There were
no eyewitnesses to the accident.

77. A year before he died, Don thought it
would be prudent to draft a will. Don
asked his accountant to review Don's
assets and draft a report so that Don
would know the extent, nature and
worth of his estate. Paula served a
request to produce that report. Donna
objected. Which of the following is
the strongest objection Donna could
make?

A. The report is irrelevant.

B. The report contains confidential

information.

C. The report is protected by the

work product immunity.

98 CIVIL PROCEDURE

C. The protective order should be
granted because the facts and
opinions held by an expert,
like Eggbert, who has been re-
tained or specially employed in
preparation for trial, can only be
discovered upon a showing of
exceptional circumstances.

D. The protective order should be

denied.

79. At trial, Paula's only evidence on liabil-
ity is the expert testimony of Eggbert
who testified that, based upon the cir-
cumstantial evidence he viewed at the
scene of the accident, including skid
marks, the position of the trucks and
the condition of the wreckage, it was
his opinion that Don's truck could well
have veered into Paul's lane. On cross-
examination, Eggbert also testified that
it was equally possible that Paul's truck
could have veered into Don's lane. Be-
fore Paula had an opportunity to put on
her damage evidence, Donna moved for
judgment as a matter of law on the issue
of causation. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. Donna's motion is premature
and, therefore, should not be
granted because Paula has not
yet put on her whole case.

B. Donna's motion should be de-
nied because the credibility of
Eggbert is for the jury to deter-
mine, not the court.

nor in the custody nor a person
in the custody or under the legal
control of a party.

C. The court should grant the mo-

81. Pam moved, under F.R.C.P. 35(a), to
compel Del to submit to a neurological
and a psychological examination based
upon an affidavit from Pam's attorney
that his review of court files shows that
Del has been convicted of reckless driv-
ing four times. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. The court should grant the mo-
tion because Del is a person who
is under the control of Acme,
Inc., a party defendant.

B. The court should deny the motion
because Pam has not shown that
Del's nervous system and mental
state are "in controversy."

C. The court should grant the mo-
tion because Del's ability to
drive a vehicle safely is centrally
relevant to the case. 

Questions 80 - 84 are based on the
following facts:

Pam and Del collided at an intersection at
2:00 a.m. Believing that Del was driving in
the course of his employment for Acme, Inc.,
Pam, an Arizonan, brought a personal injury
suit in federal court against Acme, Inc., a
California corporation, alleging that Del ran
a red light at the intersection. (Assume di-
versity jurisdiction.) Acme, Inc. denied that
Del ran the light and alleged that Pam ran the
red light. As a result of the accident, neither
Pam nor Del recall the circumstances leading
up to the collision. Pam's only evidence to
prove Del caused the accident is Willy who is
prepared to testify to the following: that, for
10 minutes before the collision, he had been
following Del's vehicle and that, at each red
light, Del ran the light. However, Del turned
off the street prior to the intersection where
the collision occurred and, thus, did not wit-
ness the collision.

80. Acme moved, under F.R.C.P. 35(a), to
compel an eye examination of Willy,
submitting an affidavit from Willy's
ex-wife in which she affirmed that Willy
suffers from serious night blindness.
Which of the following statements is
most nearly correct?

A. The court should grant the mo-
tion because the affidavit from
Willy's wife shows that the
condition of Willy's eyes are "in
controversy."

100 CIVIL PROCEDURE

D. The court should deny the mo-
tion because the affidavit of
Pam's attorney is not based upon
personal knowledge.

82. Pam moved for summary judgment
submitting in support of her motion the
affidavit of Willy that states, under oath,
what he is prepared to testify to at trial
(as set forth in the base facts above).
In response, Acme, Inc. only submitted
its answer, in which it denied that Del
ran the red light and alleged that Pam
did. Which statement most correctly
expresses how the court should rule on
Pam's summary judgment motion?

A. The motion should be denied
because Pam did not meet her
movant's burden.

B. The motion should be granted
because Acme, Inc. did not meet
its respondent's burden.

C. The motion should be denied
because there is a two-sided fact
issue regarding causation which
should go to the jury.

D. The motion should be granted
because courts never grant offen-
sive summary judgment motions
based on affidavit testimony.

CP

83. Assume, for purposes of the remainder
of this series of questions, that Pam's
summary judgment motion in Question
82 was denied. At trial, Pam's liability
case consists of (1) Willy 's testimony
as described in the base facts above and
(2) the testimony of two bishops (newly
discovered by Pam) who swear that they
saw Del run the red light. Acme, Inc.'s
rebuttal case consists of one witness, a
twice-convicted perjurer, who swears
that he saw Pam run the red light. After
the jury returned a verdict in favor of
Acme, Inc., Pam moved for a judgment
as a matter of law in her favor and, in
the alternative, for a new trial. Which of
the following statements most correctly
expresses how the court should rule on
Pam's motion for judgment as a matter
of law?

A. Pam's motion should be denied
because an offensive motion for
judgment as a matter of law can
never be granted where the mov-
ant has offered oral testimony,
since credibility is always a jury
issue.

B. Pam's motion should be granted
because Pam met her burden of
production and Acme, Inc. did
not.

C. Pam's motion should be denied
because Pam did not make a mo-
tion for a judgment as a matter
of law before the close of all the
evidence. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 101

D. Pam's motion should be grant-	
ed because Pam's case "over- 	
whelmed" Acme's case.	

D. The reversal was proper because
Juror Joan's affidavit was inad-
missible.

84. Assume, for purposes of the remainder
of this series of questions, that the court
granted Pam's motion for judgment as
a matter of law. The court also condi-
tionally granted Pam's motion for a
new trial. Her motion was based upon
an affidavit of a juror, Joan, who swore
in an affidavit, that she voted against
Pam because she was biased against
Pam based on Pam's race. Acme, Inc.
appealed the granting of the judgment a
matter of law and the new trial motion.
The Court of Appeals reversed the grant
of the judgment as a matter of law and
also the grant of the new trial motion.
Which of the following statements best
expresses the correctness of the Court
of Appeals reversal of the lower court's
new trial order?

A. The reversal was improper
because appellate courts never
reverse the exercise of discretion
of the lower court on new trial
motions.

B. The reversal was improper
because the lower court's con-
ditional grant of a new trial was
not a "final decision."

C. The reversal was improper be-
cause bias is an improper basis
for determining a jury verdict.

Questions 85 - 91 are based on the
following facts:

Darren was a student at Hower U., a college
located on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe,
10 miles from the Nevada-California border.
Darren's parents live in Anaheim, Califor-
nia. One night, Darren had been drinking
all evening at Beers, a bar located on the
California side of the border, and 20 miles
from Hower U. Beers advertised itself in the
student newspaper at Hower U. as a "way
cool" student hangout. The bar was very
popular with Hower U. students. Totally
"lit," and headed back to the dorm, Darren
got into a collision near the campus, inside
Nevada, with a Jaguar automobile owned
and operated by Pam, whose home is in Las
Vegas. Pam brought a personal injury suit,
in a federal district court in Nevada, against
Beers for $105,000, including $75,000 for
pain and suffering alleging that Beers con-
tinued to serve alcohol to Darren knowing
he was drunk and was, therefore, responsible
for the collision and Pam's injuries.

85. Beers made a pre-answer motion to dis-
miss Pam's suit on the ground that the
court lacked subject matter jurisdiction
over her claim. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. The court has diversity jurisdic-

tion.

B. The court does not have diversity
jurisdiction because Beers is also
a Nevada citizen, like Pam, since
it "does business" in Nevada by
soliciting business in Nevada.

C. The court does not have diversity
jurisdiction because Pam cannot
prove to a legal certainty that she
will recover the full $75,000 in
pain and suffering damages.

D. The court does not have diver-
sity jurisdiction because Darren
is also a California citizen like
Beers.

86. Assume, for purposes of the remain-
der of this series of questions, that the
court denied Beers' pre-answer motion
in Question 85. Beers then answered
Pam's complaint, denying, in part, (1)
that Darren was drunk when he left the
bar and (2) that Darren caused the col-
lision. Beers' answer also affirmatively
alleged, as affirmative defenses, (a) that
Pam's negligence caused the collision
and (b) that the court does not have
personal jurisdiction over Beers. Beers
then moved to dismiss Pam's complaint
for lack of personal jurisdiction. As-
sume Nevada has a long arm statute
which limits tort actions in Nevada
courts against non-residents to actions
arising out of tortious conduct (not just
injury) occurring in Nevada. Which of
the following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. The court can exercise personal
jurisdiction over Beers because
it solicited business in Nevada. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 103

B. The court cannot exercise per-
sonal jurisdiction over Beers
because Beers serves customers
(including Darren) exclusively
in California.

C. The court cannot exercise per-
sonal jurisdiction over Beers
because Pam's action arises out
of tortious conduct occurring in
California.

D. The court can exercise per-
sonal jurisdiction because Beers
waived its personal jurisdiction
defense.

87. Assume, for purposes of the remainder
of this series of questions, that the court
denied Beers' motion in Question 86.
Beers then abandoned defense of the
suit, ignoring all discovery orders. The
court finally entered a default judg-
ment for Pam for $30,000 on July 1,
1992. Two months later, Pam brought
another suit against Beers arising out
of the same auto collision with Darren,
demanding $80,000 in damages for
injury to her Jaguar automobile. Beers
moved to dismiss Pam's suit based upon
the July 1, 1992 judgment in Pam's
previous suit against Beers. Which of
the following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. The court should grant the mo-

tion.

104 CIVIL PROCEDURE

B. The court should not grant the
motion because the 7/1/92 judg-
ment was not "on the merits."

C. The court should not grant the
motion because Pam's second
suit against Beers asserts a differ-
ent right than her previous suit.

D. The court should not grant
the motion because the 7/1/92
judgment is not "valid" since
that judgment was for less than
$75,000.

88. Assume, for purposes of the remainder
of this series of questions, that the court
granted Beers' motion in Question 87
and entered judgment for Beers on Sep-
tember 1, 1992. Pam filed suit against
Darren in a federal district court in Cali-
fornia demanding $80,000 in damages
for injury to her Jaguar automobile,
serving him personally while he was
home visiting his parents in Irvine.
Darren made a pre-answer motion to
dismiss Pam's complaint on the ground
that the court lacked personal jurisdic-
tion over him. Which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. The court should deny Darren's
motion because Pam's cause
of action arose out of Darren's
drinking in California.

B. The court should grant Darren's
motion because the collision
arose directly out of Darren's
driving in Nevada. 

C. The court should grant Darren's
motion because most of the evi-
dence relating to the cause of the
collision, including witnesses, is
located in Nevada.

D. The court should deny Darren's
motion because Darren was
served in California.

90. Assume, for purposes of the remainder
of this series of questions, that the court
denied Darren's motion in Question 89.
Darren moved to dismiss Pam's action

ment in the second Pam v. Beers suit.
Which of the following statements is
most nearly correct?

89. Assume, for purposes of the remainder

A. Darren's motion should be de-
nied because Darren is a Califor-
nia citizen and Pam is a Nevada
citizen.

B. Darren's motion should be grant-

citizen like Pam.

C. Darren's motion should be grant-
ed because Darren is a citizen of
the forum state, California.

D. Darren's motion should be de-
nied because he waived his sub-
ject matter jurisdiction defense.

A. The court should deny Darren's
motion because neither res judi-
cata nor any joinder rule required
Pam to join Darren as a co-defen-
dant alongside Beers.

B. The court should deny Darren's
motion because Darren waived
his res judicata defense by failing
to include it in his pre-answer
motion.

C. The court should grant Darren's
motion because Pam should not
be allowed to "hedge her bets"
by suing a series of defendants,
one-by-one, on the same prop-
erty claim until the supply of
defendants runs out.

D. The court should deny Darren's
motion because the 9/1/92 judg-

91. Assume, for this question, that the court
denied Darren's motion in Question
90. Pam moved for partial summary
judgment, based on the July 1, 1992
judgment in Pam's favor in the first Pam
v. Beers suit, on the issue of Darren's
liability for causing the collision. Which
of the following statements is not cor-
rect?

A. Pam cannot invoke collateral es-
toppel because the Due Process
clause prevents Darren from
being bound by the 7/1/92 judg-
ment.

B. Pam cannot invoke collateral
estoppel because no facts were
actually determined in the first
Pam v. Beers suit.

C. Pam cannot invoke collateral
estoppel because the 7/1/92 judg-
ment was not "on the merits."

D. The mutuality of estoppel rule
is inapplicable to resolve the is-
sue whether Pam can invoke the
benefits of collateral estoppel.

106 CIVIL PROCEDURE

Questions 92 - 96 are based on the
following facts:

Jacques and Jill are graduate students at a
private university in Pomona, California.
Jacques is a French citizen. Prior to her com-
ing to California to study, Jill lived with her
parents in Phoenix, Arizona. Jill, however,
left on very bad terms and vowed never to re-
turn to her parents' home in Arizona. Jacques
and Jill met while students at the university
in Pomona, fell in love, married and rented
a condo in Pomona. After one year of mar-
riage, they began arguing a lot and Jill sus-
pected Jacques of having many extra-marital
affairs. One evening, Jacques and Jill were
returning from a movie. Jacques was driving
and Jill was a passenger and the two began
arguing violently. Their car collided with a
car driven by Don, a Californian. Jacques
and Jill sued Don in federal district court
in Santa Ana, California. Jacques asserted a
claim for loss of Jill's consortium, demand-
ing $40,000 in damages, including $10,000
in punitive damages, and Jill asserted a
claim for her personal injuries, demanding
$100,000 in damages, including $60,000
in punitive damages. Their complaint de-
manded a jury trial on both claims.

92. Don moved to dismiss both Jacques and
Jill's claims for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction. On the issue of "complete
diversity," which of the following state-
ments is most nearly correct?

A. The court has alienage jurisdic-
tion over Jacques' claim but must
dismiss Jill's claim because she
is a citizen of California. 

B. The court has alienage jurisdic-
tion over both Jacques and Jill's
claims because Jill takes on the
domicile of her husband.

C. The court does not have diversity
jurisdiction over either Jacques
or Jill's claims because Jill's
California citizenship destroys
complete diversity.

D. The court has diversity juris-
diction over both Jacques and
Jill's claims because Jacques is
a French citizen and Jill is an
Arizona citizen.

93. In Don's motion to dismiss for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction, Don also
claims Jacques and Jill's claims do not
satisfy the jurisdictional "amount in
controversy" requirement. On the issue
of "amount in controversy," which of
the following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. Jacques' claim does not meet the
amount in controversy require-
ment while Jill's claim does.

B. Because Jacques and Jill can
aggregate their claims, both
their claims meet the amount in
controversy requirement.

C. Neither Jacques' claim nor Jill's
claim meet the amount in contro-
versy requirement.

D. Jill's claim independently meets
the amount in controversy re-
quirement and Jacques' claim
will be saved by the exercise of
pendent party (i.e., supplemen-
tal) jurisdiction.

94. Assume, for purposes of the remainder
of this series of questions, that the court
denied Don's motion with respect to
both Jacques and Jill's claims. Don filed
and served his answer to the complaint,
which included an affirmative defense
to Jacques' claim that Jacques was con-
tributorily negligent. Assume that con-
tributory negligence is an absolute bar
to recovery. Don moved to have Jacques
and Jill's claims tried to a judge, in-
stead of a jury, citing a California state
statute that requires all personal injury
claims asserting punitive damages to
be tried by the court rather than a jury.
The statute was enacted in response to
skyrocketing punitive damages jury
verdicts. Plaintiffs opposed Don's mo-
tion, asserting their 7th Amendment
right to a jury trial of all issues relating
to their damage claims. On the "jury
trial" issue, which of the following
statements is most nearly correct?

A. The "Erie" doctrine requires the
court to apply the California stat-
ute because that statute embodies
important substantive interests.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 107

B. The Supreme Court's ruling in
Hanna v. Plumer does not require
the federal district court to apply
the 7th Amendment because it
is not a "Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure."

C. The Supremacy Clause of the
U.S. Constitution requires the
federal district court to apply the
7th Amendment to Jill's jury trial
issue.

D. The federal district court can ap-
ply the California statute because
there will be no outcome differ-
ence between a judge vs. a jury
trial.

95. For purposes of the remainder of this
series of questions, assume that the
court denied Don's motion in Ques-
tion 94. After a jury trial, during which
Jacques offered minimal evidence of
damages on his consortium claim and
Don offered substantial evidence that
plaintiffs' marriage was in trouble, the
jury rendered the following verdict:
(1) On Jacques' claim, in favor of Don.
(2) On Jill's claim, in favor of Jill for
$80,000. Judgment was entered upon
the verdict on April 1, 1993. Jacques
filed a California state court suit against
Don for his personal injuries caused
by the collision with Don's car. Don's
answer included an affirmative defense
that Jacques was contributorily negli-
gent. Don moved to dismiss Jacques'
claim based upon the April 1, 1993
judgment in Jacques and Jill v. Don. As-
sume the California law of res judicata
defines "cause of action" according to
the "primary rights" test. Which of the
following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. The court should deny Don's
motion because, applying the
primary rights test, Jacques did
not split his cause of action.

B. The court should grant Don's
motion because, applying the
"same transaction test," Jacques
split his cause of action. 

108 CIVIL PROCEDURE

C. The court should deny Don's
motion because Jacques' loss
of consortium claim in the prior
(federal) suit against Don de-
rives from Jill's injury whereas
Jacques' claim in the current
(state) suit asserts Jacques' own
injuries.

D. The court should grant Don's
motion because Jacques was in
privity with Jill in the prior fed-
eral court suit.

96. Assume, for this question, that the
court denied Don's motion in Ques-
tion 95. Don again moved to dismiss
Jacques' claim based upon the April 1,
1993 judgment, in the prior federal suit.
Don's contention, this time, was that
Jacques is collaterally estopped from
proving that he was not contributorily
negligent. Which of the following state-
ments is most nearly correct?

A. Jacques should be collaterally
estopped on the issue of con-
tributory negligence because
the federal court "actually and
necessarily determined" that
Jacques was contributorily neg-
ligent.

B. Jacques should not be collater-
ally estopped on the issue of
contributory negligence because
the state court cannot tell wheth-
er the federal court "actually
determined" that Jacques was
contributorily negligent.

C. Jacques should not be collater-
ally estopped on the issue of
contributory negligence because,
although the state court knows
that the federal court "actually
determined" that Jacques was
contributorily negligent, it can-
not know whether such deter-
mination was "necessary" to the
judgment.

D. Jacques should not be collater-
ally estopped on the issue of
contributory negligence because
he did not have a "full and fair
opportunity to litigate" this is-
sue.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

Q

97. DeWinter moved for summary judg-
ment, based upon the September 1,
1992 judgment of acquittal in the
California murder case that had been
brought against him. In this motion,
DeWinter asked to court to find that
the judgment of acquittal conclusively
establishes, for purposes of his civil suit
against Floyd's, that DeWinter did not
murder his wife. Which of the following
statements is not correct?

A. Mutuality of estoppel, assuming
that it was the applicable law,
would not permit DeWinter to
use collateral estoppel against
Floyd's, a stranger to the prior
criminal proceeding.

B. The Due Process clause prevents
DeWinter from using collat-
eral estoppel against Floyd's,
a stranger to the prior criminal
proceeding.

C. DeWinter cannot use collateral
estoppel because the burdens of
persuasion in the prior criminal
suit and in DeWinter's civil suit
are different.

D. In order to acquit DeWinter in
the criminal trial, the jury must
have actually and necessarily
determined that there was a rea-
sonable doubt as to whether he
murdered Rebecca. 

Questions 97 - 100 are based on the
following facts:

On January 1, 1992, DeWinter was charged
with the murder of his wife, Rebecca. On
April 1, 1992, DeWinter stood trial in Cali-
fornia on this charge. Evidence introduced
by the prosecution showed, inter alia, (1)
that during the year prior to Rebecca's
death, DeWinter had been carrying on a
passionate affair with Cecily, (2) that, dur-
ing that time, DeWinter had purchased an
"accidental death" life insurance policy
on Rebecca's life for $1,000,000 and (3)
that, three months after Rebecca's death,
DeWinter and Cecily were secretly mar-
ried. DeWinter offered, in his defense, the
testimony of Cecily who stated that she was
present when Rebecca died and she saw
Rebecca jump off a cliff into the rocks be-
low. The prosecution claimed that Rebecca
was pushed by DeWinter but could produce
no eyewitnesses of its own. DeWinter was
acquitted and a judgment of acquittal was
entered on September 1, 1992.

On October 1, 1992, DeWinter filed a death
benefits claim with Floyd's of London, the
insurance company from which DeWinter
had purchased the "accidental death" life
insurance policy on Rebecca's life. Floyd's
refused to pay, claiming that Rebecca's
death was not an accident but that she had
been murdered by DeWinter. On December
1, 1992, DeWinter brought suit in federal
court in Los Angeles to recover on Rebecca's
life insurance policy. DeWinter is a British
subject who has been domiciled in Santa
Monica, California since 1983. Floyd's is a
California corporation with its headquarters
in Los Angeles.

99. Assume, for the remainder of this se-
ries of questions, that the court denied
DeWinter's motion in Question 98. The
jury rendered a verdict for DeWinter.
Two days later, Floyd's moved to dis-
miss the suit on grounds that the court
lacked subject matter jurisdiction to
enter judgment on the verdict. Which of
the following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. Floyd's motion should be denied
because, by waiting until after
the jury verdict to challenge sub-
ject matter jurisdiction, Floyd's
has waived this defense.

B. Floyd's motion should be denied
because the court has alienage
jurisdiction.

C. Floyd's motion should be granted
because complete diversity does
not exist since both DeWinter
and Floyd's are California do-
miciliaries.

D. Floyd's motion should be granted
because DeWinter's claim does
not "arise under" federal law.

98. Assume, for the remainder of this se-
ries of questions, that the court denied
DeWinter's motion in Question 97.
On the third day of trial, DeWinter
and Cecil)/ each testified that they saw
Rebecca accidentally fall off the cliff to
her death. In its case-in-chief, Floyd's
produced no eyewitnesses of its own
to Rebecca's death. At the close of
all the evidence, DeWinter moved for
judgment as a matter of law, which
was opposed by Floyd's. Which of the
following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. The court should grant the mo-
tion because Floyd's failed to
meet its burden of production
to offer testimonial evidence to
contradict directly DeWinter's
eyewitnesses.

B. The court should deny the mo-
tion because courts never grant
an offensive judgment as a mat-
ter of law where the movant's
case relies heavily on testimonial
evidence.

C. The court should grant the mo-
tion because DeWinter met its
burden of production.

D. The court should deny the mo-
tion because DeWinter has not
shown conclusively that Re-
becca's death was accidental.   

CIVIL PROCEDURE

D. Even if the court believes Juliet's
affidavit, the court should deny
Floyd's motion because it is un-
timely.

END OF QUESTIONS

100. Assume for this question, that the
court denied Floyd's motion in Ques-
tion 99. Three weeks after entry of
judgment, Floyd's moved for a new
trial on grounds of jury misconduct.
Floyd's offered in support of its mo-
tion the affidavit of Juliet, a juror, who
affirmed that Jack, another juror, had
told the jury, during its deliberations,
that he had done his own "snooping
around" and had been told by certain
employees at Floyd's (who spoke with
Jack, not knowing he was a juror) that
Floyd's knew that DeWinter didn't kill
Rebecca and that Rebecca was a noto-
rious "klutz" who probably slipped and
accidentally fell off the cliff. Which of
the following statements is most nearly
correct?

A. If the court believes Juliet's af-
fidavit, the court should grant
Floyd's motion because evidence
of extraneous prejudicial infor-
mation improperly brought to
the jury's attention is admissible
in federal court to impeach the
verdict.

B. Even if the court believes Juliet's
affidavit, the court should deny
Floyd's motion because there is
no showing that Juror Jack's mis-
conduct prejudiced the verdict.

C. If the court believes Juliet's af-
fidavit, the court should grant
Floyd's motion because evidence
of extrinsic misconduct is admis-
sible to impeach the verdict.

CIVIL PROCEDURE
ANSWERS 

1. C is correct. Nothing in the facts indi-
cate that Dr. Feelgood is targeting a na-
tional market merely because his office
is located near an interstate off-ramp. A
is incorrect because Dr. Feelgood has
the option of challenging personal juris-
diction either in a pre-answer motion or
in his answer. B is incorrect because the
federal rules do not adopt the "special
appearance" procedure for challenging
personal jurisdiction (see F.R.C.P. 12).
D is incorrect because Dr. Feelgood did
nothing to lure motorists from other
states to his office in Phoenix. Rigg
just happened to exit the freeway near-
est Dr. Feelgood's office, and, further,
Rigg just happened to notice his sign,
not while traveling on the interstate,
but after exiting the interstate on Main
Street.

A

0 0<_ 

2. C is correct. California, like virtually
all other states, has a statute that au-
thorizes its courts to exercise personal
jurisdiction over persons served within
the state. Such exercise of personal
jurisdiction is probably valid under the
Territoriality Rule, which a plurality of
the Supreme Court affirmed in Justice
Scalia's opinion in Burnham v. Superior
Court (1990). A is incorrect because
the Territoriality Rule, rather than the
minimum contacts rule, probably gov-
erns the issue of personal jurisdiction
on these facts. Further, even under the
minimum contacts rule, one can argue
that it is "fair" to subject Dr. Feelgood
to personal jurisdiction (see Justice
Brennan's concurring opinion in Burn-
ham). B and D are incorrect because the
Territoriality Rule probably governs
this issue and, even if the "minimum
contacts" rule is applicable, B and D do
not address the threshold requirement
of purposeful availment.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 113

5. D is correct. At the time the third-party
complaint was filed, Dr. Feelgood and
Drugco were completely diverse par-
ties. Subsequent changes in citizenship
do not automatically divest the court
of diversity jurisdiction. A is incorrect
because supplemental jurisdiction is
not an issue. The court has diversity
jurisdiction over all three claims be-
tween Dr. Feelgood and Drugco. B is
incorrect because the defense that the
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction
can be raised anytime during the life of
the original lawsuit. C is incorrect, first,
because supplemental jurisdiction is not
an issue and, second, because even if
supplemental jurisdiction were an issue,
the court cannot exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over unrelated claims. 

A

3. C is correct. Dr. Feelgood's third-party
complaint does not assert a derivative
claim against Drugco. Dr. Feelgood's
third-party complaint denies all liability
to Mack and shifts all liability to Drug-
co. A proper third-party claim would
allege: "If Dr. Feelgood is held liable
to Mack, then Drugco is liable to Dr.
Feelgood." A is incorrect because diver-
sity of citizenship exists between Mac
(California) and Feelgood (Arizona)
and between Feelgood (Arizona) and
Drugco (California); thus, each claim
is supported by diversity jurisdiction. B
is incorrect for reasons stated in answer
C. D is incorrect because the impleader
rule (F.R.C.P. 14) says nothing about
"same transaction or occurrence."

4. D is correct. Claim 1 is a derivative
claim, and proper under F.R.C.P. 14(a);
claims 2 and 3 are proper because, once
Dr. Feelgood has properly asserted
a claim against Drugco, F.R.C.P. 18
permits Dr. Feelgood to assert as many
other claims against Drugco as he wants
whether or not those claims are related
to the derivative claim.

114 CIVIL PROCEDURE

6. B is correct. Dave just happened to
serve a New Yorker (Pat) who just hap-
pened to pull into Dave's restaurant.
Dave's decision to locate his Burger-
Quick restaurant just off the exit ramp
of an interstate does not translate into
purposeful availment of the national
market. Dave did nothing to draw cus-
tomers from other states. Furthermore,
the brand name recognition that Dave
gets from operating a BurgerQuick
franchise does not translate into pur-
poseful availment of the national mar-
ket because travelers from other states
are not coming to Santa Ana just to eat
at Dave's particular BurgerQuick. The
benefit to brand name recognition is
that hungry travelers (including those
from California) who want to stop for
fast food will be more likely to eat at
a BurgerQuick than a "mom and pop"
operation. A is incorrect because Dave
did not waive his personal jurisdiction
defense under F.R.C.P. 12(b), which,
under Hanna v. Plumer, governs the
issue of how to challenge diversity ju-
risdiction in federal court regardless of
the basis of subject matter jurisdiction.
C is incorrect for the same reason B is
correct. D is incorrect because, unlike
the cause of action in the Burger King
case, Pat's tort claim does not arise out
of Dave's contract with BurgerQuick.

7. A is correct. Choices I, II and III each
apply elements that are relevant under
New York's long arm statute and apply
them correctly to the facts.     

8. B is correct. It contains the only argu-
ment that is not plausible under Shaffer
v. Heitner. This is because the argument
in answer B is based upon the Ter-
ritoriality Rule and Shaffer v. Heitner
eliminated the "in rem" wing of the Ter-
ritoriality Rule. Arguments contained
in answers A, C and D are all plausible
because they each speak to the issue of
whether it is "fair" to sue Dave in New
York based upon his "contacts" with
that state.

9. D is correct. Choices II and III are the
only correct choices. Choice II is cor-
rect because a case is not removable
where original jurisdiction is based
solely on diversity and a defendant is a
citizen of the forum state. Choice III is
correct because a civil action can only
be removed to a federal district court
for the district and division embracing
the place where such action is pending
which, under these facts, is the Southern
District of California, not the Central
District. A is incorrect because Dave is
a citizen of the forum state of Califor-
nia.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 115

11. A is most nearly correct. CompuChip
should be prepared to defend in the
U.S. lawsuits arising out of motorcycle
computer chips. Although Paul's suit
does not directly arise out of the delib-
erate marketing of ordinary computer
chips, it significantly "relates" to those
purposeful contacts. B is incorrect be-
cause it is completely irrelevant to the
issue of whether CompuChip intended
to serve the California market in its
"special" chips. C is incorrect because
Paul's cause of action is completely
unrelated to CompuChip's real estate
holdings, and cannot constitute suffi-
cient contacts for personal jurisdiction.
D is incorrect because this contract is
unrelated to Paul's cause of action. This
contract would be a relevant contact
with California if, for example, Corn-
puChip failed to pay the California
company for its design services. 

A

10. B is correct. CompuChip did not pur-
posefully avail itself of the California
market. In Asahi Metal Industry v Su-
ity opinion stated that "a defendant's
awareness that the stream of commerce
may or will sweep the product into the
forum state does not convert the mere
act of placing the product into the
stream into an act purposefully directed
toward the forum State." Even apply-
ing Justice Brennan's "stream of com-
merce" theory, purposeful availment
is lacking because, in Asahi, the sales
of the component parts to the manu-
facturer of the finished product were
characterized as "regular and exten-
sive." This is clearly not the case with
CompuChip which, aside from the ten
"special" chips, had never sold any in
the U.S.. CompuChip just happened to
sell these 10 chips to Dirk's friend who
unilaterally brought them to the U.S.. A
is incorrect because, unlike Asahi, the
claim arose directly out of an injury to
a plaintiff in California and the plaintiff
is a Californian. C is incorrect because
the Supreme Court has not abandoned
the threshold requirement of purposeful
availment. D is incorrect for reasons
stated above.

116 CIVIL PROCEDURE

12. The best answer is D. Whether or not
venue is improper, CompuChip previ-
ously brought a pre-answer motion
under Rule 12(b) and omitted from
that motion an objection to venue. The
venue objection is, therefore, waived
under Rule 12(h)(1) even if venue
was improperly laid. Therefore, B is
incorrect. A might be correct  but only
if the court finds that CompuChip had
sufficient contacts with the Central
District of California to be subject to
personal jurisdiction in that district or
if the court determined that a substantial
part of the events giving rise to Paul's
claim occured in the Central District of
California. C is incorrect because it is
irrelevant, under the current venue law,
where the plaintiff resides.

13. C is correct. As a matter of joinder, once
Dirk properly cross-claimed against
CompuChip, Rule 18 allowed Dirk to
join as many other claims he may have
against CompuChip whether related or
not. There is no problem with subject
matter jurisdiction because alienage
jurisdiction supports a claim between
an American citizen and an alien (here,
Japanese) corporation. A is incorrect
because supplemental jurisdiction is
not required (see supra). B is incorrect
because it ignores Rule 18. D is incor-
rect because personal jurisdiction is no
longer an issue once the court denied
CompuChip's motion to dismiss for
lack of personal jurisdiction.

14. C is correct. The presence of a non-di-
verse defendant destroys the "diversity"
jurisdiction (i.e., 28 U.S.C. section
1332) that supports the claims against
both Dirk and CompuChip. A is incor-
rect for the reason stated in connection
with answer C. B is incorrect because
the only damage figure that is relevant
for amount in controversy purposes is
the "ad damnum" figure in the com-
plaint. D is incorrect because objection
to subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any time during the lifetime
of the original lawsuit.

15. D is correct. There is no judicial dis-
trict in which venue would otherwise
be proper [under section 1391(b)(1) or
(2)], and Dirk ("any defendant") may
be "found" in the Southern District. A
is incorrect because Diana has a choice
whether to assert her improper venue
defense in her answer or by pre-answer
motion. B is incorrect because it does
not take account of section 1391(b)(3)
which is meant to address the situation
where sections 1391(b)(1) and (2) do
not yield a judicial district in which
venue is proper. C is incorrect because
the underlying rule statement contained
in this answer is incorrect [see section
1391(b)].

16. A is the best answer. In order for Turkey
to be a non-viable alternative forum,
its law must not effectively offer any
remedy to Pam. Under the facts, Turk-
ish law is just not as favorable to Pam as
is U.S. antitrust law. Choices B, C and
D each present plausible arguments. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 117

A

17. C is correct. It is the only answer that
does not contain a plausible argument.
The argument contained in C is based
upon the old Territoriality Rule. After
Shaffer v. Heitner, the Territoriality
Rule can no longer be applied to deter-
mine the constitutionality of quasi-in-
rem jurisdiction under the Due Process
Clause. Each of the other answers is
plausible because each is framed in
terms of "fairness" to the defendant-
owner of the res that was seized for
jurisdictional purposes.

18. C is correct. The court has the constitu-
tional and statutory power to exercise
supplemental (formerly known as
"pendent") jurisdiction over the state
law claim between non-diverse parties
because Pam had originally filed a com-
plaint which contained a colorable (i.e.,
non-frivolous) Sherman Act claim over
which the court had federal question ju-
risdiction. That claim was dismissed for
want of sufficient proof (not because the
complaint's allegations failed to state
a colorable claim under the Sherman
Act). Pam's state tort claim is so related
to the antitrust claim so that they form
part of the same case or controversy
under Article III of the U.S. Constitu-
tion. Thus, the court has the power to
hear the state claim [28 U.S.C. section
1367(a)] even though the federal claim
has been dismissed. However, the court
also has the discretion under section
1367(c)(3) to decline to exercise this
power. A is incorrect because it fails
to consider the supplemental jurisdic-
tion statute. B is incorrect because
the supplemental jurisdiction statute
permits the court to decline to exercise
this power in circumstances outlined
in section 1367(c). D is incorrect. The
Sherman Act claim was not dismissed
because of a failure of the complaint to
state a colorable claim under the Sher-
man Act, but because of insufficient
evidence. 

118 CIVIL PROCEDURE

19. D is correct. The argument in choice II
is incorrect because complete diversity
is not determined at the time of the ac-
cident but at the time the complaint is
filed. The argument in choice IV is not
correct because subject matter jurisdic-
tion has nothing to do with where the
cause of action arose. It is, however,
relevant to the issue of personal juris-
diction. Choice I is correct because the
court can consider behavior by the party
subsequent to the filing of the complaint
if it is relevant to that party's intent at
time of filing the complaint. The facts
that Pauline moved to Nevada two
weeks after the collision and a month
before filing suit in federal district court
and that she returned to California three
months after filing suit is circumstantial
evidence that she really did not intend,
at the time of filing, to remain in Nevada
for the foreseeable future. Choice III
is correct because these facts provide
a basis for a reasonable inference that
Pauline was abandoning her California
domicile and acquiring a Nevada domi-
cile.

A

0
0 -m <
CP 

20. D is correct. First, the impleader was
proper because Dan's claim against
Dotty for contribution is a contingent
claim for reimbursement. Second, the
California court can exercise personal
jurisdiction over Dotty because she
was personally served with process in
California (see Burnham). A is incor-
rect because Dotty's attack on personal
jurisdiction was procedurally proper
under F.R.C.P. 12(b). Further, Hanna
v. Plumer requires the federal court to
apply all federal rules of civil procedure
that are on point over a conflicting state
rule. B is incorrect because it ignores
the Territoriality Rule as a valid basis
for exercising personal jurisdiction
under the Due Process Clause. C is
incorrect because Dan is not trying
to shift liability over to Dotty thereby
effectively making her the defendant.
Rather, he is asserting that, if he is held
liable to Pauline, Dotty has to pay her
proportional share of whatever Dan
pays to Pauline.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 119

A

21. C is correct. First, regarding the join-
der issue, once Dan properly asserted
(through impleader) a contribution
claim against Dotty, Rule 18 allows
him to assert as many other claims as
he may have against Dotty. Second,
regarding the subject matter jurisdiction
issue, Dan can aggregate his two claims
against Dotty to satisfy the $75,000
amount in controversy requirement.
A is incorrect because it ignores Rule
18. B is incorrect because it ignores
the aggregation rules. D is incorrect
because supplemental jurisdiction is
not required since Dan can aggregate.

22. C is correct. In determining whether
complete diversity exists between Pau-
line and Dotty, the court looks to the
date Pauline amended her third-party
complaint against Dotty. A is incorrect
because the court does not look to the
date Pauline filed her complaint against
Dan to determined whether diversity
existed between Dan and Dotty. B is
incorrect because the court has already
ruled that it can exercise personal ju-
risdiction over Dotty (see question 20,
supra). D is incorrect because supple-
mental jurisdiction is not required since
diversity jurisdiction supports (indepen-
dently) Pauline's claim against Dotty.

23. A is correct. The Supplemental Ju-
risdiction statute permits the federal
district court to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over a claim that lacks an
independent basis of subject matter
jurisdiction but is sufficiently related
to a claim that is supported by an inde-
pendent basis of subject matter jurisdic-
tion. Dotty's personal injury claim is
sufficiently related because it arises out
of the same auto accident as Pauline's
main claim against Dan. B is incorrect
for two reasons. First, the Supplemental
Jurisdiction statute's language should
be cited rather than prior case-law and,
second, Dotty's claim against Pauline
is not a compulsory counterclaim since,
prior to Dotty's assertion of that claim,
Pauline and Dotty were not opposing
parties. C is incorrect because Kroger
involved a claim by the plaintiff against
the third-party defendant, not a claim
by the third-party defendant against
the plaintiff. D is incorrect because this
answer ignores the problem that Dotty's
claim falls below the $75,000 amount
in controversy. 

120 CIVIL PROCEDURE

24. C is correct. The U.S. Government is
not asking, in its third-party complaint,
for reimbursement from the captains for
whatever refund the Government has
to pay to Shrimpboats, Inc. Rather, the
Government is asserting an independent
claim against the captains based upon
their alleged employment tax liability
to the U.S. (if the court determines that
Shrimpboats, Inc. does not owe that
tax liability to the U.S.) A is incorrect
because the impleader rule [F.R.C.P.
14(a)] does not state anything about
"same operative facts." B is incor-
rect because it is possible that neither
Shrimpboats, Inc., nor the captains are
liable to the Government. The court
might deem the crewmen to be self-
employed. D is incorrect for the reasons
stated in C.

25. A is correct. Medco is, in effect, argu-
ing that the two other joint tortfeasors
should have been joined by Pete in
the federal court suit against Medco.
Joint tortfeasors are not necessary or
indispensable parties under Rule 19. It
is up to the plaintiff to determine which
defendants to sue in which actions. B
is incorrect because it fails to apply the
elements of F.R.C.P 19(a). C is incor-
rect because Medco, in the absence of
the Dr. Zorba and the hospital, will still
be able to assert its defense that they
were the cause of plaintiff's injuries.
D is incorrect because plaintiffs do not
have an absolute right to decide whom
to sue.

26. D is most nearly correct. The potential
conflict of interest between Pete, as
the class representative, and Pete, as
lawyer for the class, would be too great
for class representation to be adequate.
While the other answers contain poten-
tially viable arguments, the best answer
is D.

27. D is correct. The class members are
passengers on the flight who all claimed
to have been injured as a result of the
pilot's negligence. The only relief the
class is seeking is damages. A is incor-
rect because, even if some passengers
were to win against Global while oth-
ers were to lose, this does not impose
incompatible standards of conduct on
Global. B is incorrect because there is
no evidence that a host of individual
damage suits would bankrupt Global. C
is incorrect because the class is seeking
damage relief, not injunctive or declara-
tory judgment relief.

28. A is correct. F.R.C.P. 33(c) states: "An
interrogatory otherwise proper is not
necessarily objectionable merely be-
cause an answer to the interrogatory
involves an opinion or contention that
relates to fact or the application of
law to fact...." Therefore, all the other
choices are incorrect.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 121

A

29. C is correct because it misstates the
applicable legal standard for initial dis-
closure. As part of "Initial Disclosures,"
under F.R.C.P. 26(a)(1)(A), a party must
disclose the identity of "each individual
likely to have discoverable information
that the disclosing party may use to
support its claims or defenses, unless
solely for impeachment, identifying
the subjects of the information." A is
incorrect because this information is
required to be disclosed as part of initial
disclosure under F.R.C.P. 26(a)(1)(D).
B is incorrect because this informa-
tion is required to be disclosed under
F.R.C.P. 26(a)(2)(A) ("Disclosure of
Expert Testimony"). D is incorrect
because this information is required to
be disclosed under F.R.C.P. 26(a)(3)(A)
("Pretrial Disclosures").

30. C is correct. That portion of the cap-
tain's deposition transcript containing
his "yes" response would be admissible
as a "vicarious" party admission. It is
also admissible to impeach the captain's
trial testimony that he had nothing to
drink before take-off (as a "prior incon-
sistent statement"). Therefore, A and B
are incorrect. D is incorrect because the
captain's deposition testimony, while
admissible (under the party admission
rule) as evidence of the truth of his
statement that he had been drinking,
does not constitute a judicial admission,
which removes the fact admitted out of
the case altogether.

122 CIVIL PROCEDURE

31. D is correct. Global was obviously
using Prof's services to see whether
he would be able to testify favorably
for Global at trial. Two hours worth of
investigation, a five-page report and a
$200 "honorarium" does not indicate a
thorough investigation. Global appar-
ently found out all they needed to know.
They never contacted Prof again. A is
incorrect because it states the rule for
overcoming the work product immu-
nity. B is incorrect because the contents
of Prof's report are relevant to the sub-
ject matter (i.e., the cause of the crash)
and, also, the purpose of Prof's inves-
tigation was apparently motivated by
litigation. Global wanted to determine
Prof's suitability as a trial witness. C is
incorrect because it assumes that Prof
was "retained or specially employed"
by Global.

32. B is correct. Pete seeks to depose Mack
to discover facts that Mack learned as
an ordinary percipient witness (i.e.,
what Mack discovered as he checked
out the plane for take-off). Mack did not
learn these particular facts in prepara-
tion for trial but pursuant to his accident
prevention duties as an employee in
Global's Accident Prevention Depart-
ment. A is incorrect because it states
the standard for overcoming the work
product immunity. C is incorrect for the
reason that B is correct. D is incorrect
because the facts learned by Mack at
the crash site are clearly relevant to the
cause of the crash. 

33. A is correct. Whit's eyewitness obser-
vations of the crash are clearly relevant
and no rule protects his note to Global's
lawyers. B is incorrect because Whit
did not acquire his facts and opinions
in anticipation of litigation. While he
did write the note to Global's attorneys
with the likelihood of a lawsuit against
Global in mind, he was not retained
by Global to observe or investigate the
crash. C is incorrect because the note
is neither the work product of Global
nor its attorneys. It was a note volun-
tarily written and sent to Global by a
third party. No effort was expended
by Global or its counsel to secure this
note. D is incorrect because Whit was
not communicating with either his own
or his employer's attorneys.

34. B is correct. It is the only choice that
states an incorrect answer. It is the
old-fashioned, and fast-eroding, com-
mon law rule of "mutuality of estop-
pel," not the Due Process Clause, that
would prevent Opie, a stranger to the
federal class action suit, from invoking
collateral estoppel. The Due Process
Clause is inapplicable because Global
did, in fact, have its day in court on the
issue of pilot error as the cause of the
crash. A is incorrect because it states
a correct answer. The California state
court must give the same enforcement
scope to the federal class action judg-
ment that the federal courts give to that
judgment. C is incorrect because it,
too, contains a correct answer. Federal
law, under Parklane Hosiery, gives the
federal court discretion to refuse to
allow a stranger to invoke collateral
estoppel if the stranger stayed out of
the earlier suit because of a "wait and
see" attitude. D is incorrect because it
is a correct answer: California must
give the same enforcement scope to a
federal court judgment as the federal
courts give that judgment. Thus, if the
federal courts still applied a strict mu-
tuality rule (which, of course, they do
not), California courts could not allow
Opie to invoke collateral estoppel. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 123

A

35. A is correct. This version of the statute
violates the Seventh Amendment be-
cause it deprives a party of his right to
have all issues relating to the damage
claims tried to a jury. The other versions
of the statute — II, III and IV — are all
constitional; therefore, B, C and D are
incorrect. The terms of the statute in
version II provide for jury trials in both
damage and injunctive actions. Such a
statute would not violate the Seventh
Amendment because there is no right
to a judge (or bench) trial in a formerly
equitable claim. The terms of the statute
in version III do not address the jury
trial issue, but a court would apply the
Seventh Amendment to require a jury
trial of all issues pertaining to the dam-
age claim (if a jury trial were timely
demanded). The statute in version IV
provides for a judge, not a jury, to try
issues in suits brought by the federal
government for the imposition of fines
to vindicate public rights. Such suits,
tried before an administrative tribunal
before an administrative law judge,
have been held not to require juries
under the Seventh Amendment.

36. B is correct. Although Sporter was "in
default" for having failed to answer or
otherwise defend against the suit, his
act of engaging in settlement negotia-
tions throughout the six-week period
indicates that he did not intend to write-
off Hack's suit. Therefore, Sporter 's
settlement activities would be deemed
an "appearance" entitling him to notice
before default judgment is entered. A
is incorrect because Sporter did not
timely answer or otherwise defend. C
is incorrect because it does not address
the crucial "notice" issue. D is incorrect
because it misstates the facts.

37. B is correct. The plaintiff [under F.R.C.P.
41(a)] has a right to voluntarily dismiss
his own suit in federal court until the
defendant answers the complaint or
moves for summary judgment, which-
ever occurs first. Here, Hack filed his
notice of dismissal after Sporter served
his answer. Hence, the notice should
be quashed. A is incorrect because it
ignores the fact that Sporter served his
answer before Hack filed his notice
of dismissal. C is incorrect because it
does not apply the correct terms of Rule
41(a). D is incorrect because it contains
an incorrect statement. Plaintiffs do
have a limited right to voluntarily dis-
miss their actions under Rule 41(a). 

124 CIVIL PROCEDURE

38. B is correct. Sporter did not meet
his movant's burden because, from
Sporter's moving papers, there is still
a material issue of fact for the jury to
resolve, i.e., whether the plaintiff's
songs and the defendant's songs are
so similar the jury could infer copy-
ing by the defendant. How the judge
would find if he were the trier of fact
is irrelevant. A is incorrect for reasons
stated in connection with answer B. C
is incorrect because Hack did not have
a respondent's burden, since Sporter
failed to satisfy his movant's burden.
D is incorrect because whether or not
the two songs were similar enough to
warrant the inference of copying by
Sporter is a material issue of fact that
the jury must resolve at trial.

39. D is correct. It is the only choice which
correctly states the law under F.R.C.P.
16(e), i.e., "The order following a final
pretrial conference shall be modified
only to prevent manifest injustice."

A
0 0<

c

40. D is correct. There is a clear conflict
in the evidence that the jury must be
allowed to resolve. Despite the doubt-
ful credibility of Hack's story, the jury
- not the judge - is assigned the job of
determining credibility. If they believe
Hack's eyewitness account, they can
reasonably find that Sporter had access
to, and copied, Hack's songs. Therefore,
A and C are incorrect. B is incorrect
because F.R.C.P. 50 permits, but does
not require, the motion for judgment
as a matter of law to be made after the
opposing party has been fully heard
with respect to a material issue. Rule
50(b)(2) states that "motions for judg-
ment as a matter of law may be made at
any time before submission of the case
to the jury."

41. C is correct. The two observations of
Hack's behavior in the courtroom are
relevant to Hack's credibility which is a
crucial issue in the case. It is an issue for
the jury to resolve. The jury did noth-
ing improper in basing its credibility
determination on their observations of
Hack in the courtroom. Therefore, B is
incorrect. The jurors' observations of
Hack were not improper. A is incorrect
because the jurors' affidavits refer, in
part, to activity outside the heads of
the jurors, i.e., observations which they
made of Hack's behavior, and not just
the effect of such observations on the
thought processes of those jurors. D is
incorrect because Hack's credibility is
very crucial. He claims to have person-
ally witnessed Sporter copying Hack's
music. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 125

A

42. A is correct. To be reviewable by an ap-
pellate court, an error by the court must
be objected to at the trial court level.
Otherwise, that objection is waived.
Therefore, C is incorrect. B is incor-
rect because it is nonsense to speak of
"errors" as interlocutory. One speaks
of "decisions" as being interlocutory or
final for purposes of the final decision
rule. Hack's appeal was taken from a
final judgment. D is incorrect because
Hack's situation does not fit the strin-
gent requirements of the "exceptional
circumstances" doctrine summarized
by the 5th Circuit in Carson Products
v. Califano.

43. A is correct. Sporter is asking the Court
of Appeals for more than he received
from the trial court. Therefore, he
should have cross-appealed. As appel-
lee, this is not the kind of attack Sporter
can make on the trial court's rulings.
Therefore, B, C and D are incorrect.

44. D is correct. Under the traditional (and
still majority) common law view, there
are no compulsory counterclaims even
if the defendant's counterclaim arises
(as does Dan's) out of the same opera-
tive facts as an affirmative defense that
had been asserted by the defendant in
the prior suit. A is incorrect because
the applicable law would not be the
federal compulsory counterclaim rule,
but rather the traditional common law
rule of the state court that rendered
the judgment in Pat v. Dan and Dave.
Moreover, choice A incorrectly states
that traditional common law rule. B is
incorrect because it, too, incorrectly
states the traditional common law
view. C is incorrect because it applies
the emerging minority common law
view, not the traditional common law
approach. 

126 CIVIL PROCEDURE

45. B is correct. In order for the jury to find
for Dan on Dan's cross-claim against
Dave, it had to make an actual deter-
mination of fact that Dan was not con-
tributorily negligent and that Dave was
negligent. If Dan had been contributor-
ily negligent, the jury could not have
awarded a verdict to Dan on his cross-
claim. Therefore, A is incorrect. C is
incorrect because the verdicts for Dave
against Pat and for Dan against Dave
are not hopelessly irreconcilable. The
jury must have found that Pat was con-
tributorily negligent so that she cannot
recover against either Dan or Dave. But,
the jury must have found that Dan was
also not negligent, and that Dave was,
so that Dan can recover against Dave.
D is incorrect because there is nothing
in the facts to cast doubt on whether Pat
had a full and fair opportunity to litigate
the issue of Dan's negligence. After all,
she was the plaintiff and she sued Dan
for $55,000.

46. B is correct. Dan chose to assert his
cross-claim against Dave for property
damage ($500) to his car but "split his
cause of action" when he omitted his
claim ($60,000) for personal injury
arising out of the same auto accident
transaction as the property damage
cross-claim. A is incorrect because
cross-claims in federal court are only
permissive, never compulsory [see
F.R.C.P. 13(g)]. C is incorrect because
it ignores the fact that when Dan chose
to assert his cross-claim against Dan
for property damage, he should have
included his personal injury claim under
the federal common law of res judicata,
which adopts the "same transaction"
test for defining the scope of the cause
of action. D is incorrect because the
state court in Dan v. Dave will apply
the law of the jurisdiction (here, fed-
eral) that rendered the judgment as to
the enforcement effect to be given that
judgment. Here, the federal common
law of res judicata does not apply the
"primary rights" test. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 127

49. A is the correct answer because the test
for determining whether Pat split her
"cause of action" is the "same transac-
tion" test (since Pat brought her previ-
ous trespass suit against Don in a fed-
eral district court) and the cutting down
of the timber occurred at the same time
as the trespass and one would (for the
sake of judicial economy) expect to try
both the trespass and conversion claims
in the same suit. B is incorrect for the
reasons stated in answer A. C and D
are incorrect because they are based
upon the wrong tests for determining
the scope of the "cause of action" as-
serted by Pat in her trespass suit against
Don.

A

47. B is correct. Dan's original property
damage cross-claim was for only $500
in damages. His subsequent personal in-
jury claim was for $60,000 in damages.
Dave can hardly claim that he did not
have adequate incentive to fully litigate
the issue of his (and Dan's) negligence
since Dave was also defending himself
against Pat's $55,000 claim against Dan
and Dave. Given the realities of litiga-
tion, this gave Dan plenty of incentive
to show that Dan was negligent and
Dave was not. A is incorrect for rea-
sons given in the answer to question
45 supra. C would have been correct
if Dave had not also been defending
himself against Pat's $55,000 claim.
D is incorrect because Dave was not a
"stranger" to the earlier Pat v. Dan and
Dave lawsuit.

48. C is the correct answer because a dis-
missal on statute of limitations grounds
is not deemed to be "on the merits"
if the plaintiff can find a jurisdiction
where the action is not barred by the
local statute of limitations (as in Pat's
case). Therefore, answers A and D
are incorrect. Answer B is incorrect
because a judgment, under appropriate
circumstances, can be deemed to be "on
the merits" although not literally "on the
merits," in the sense of an adjudication
based upon the evidence presented at a
hearing. 

128 CIVIL PROCEDURE

50. C is most nearly correct because a per-
son who was neither a party to a suit nor
in privity with a party cannot be bound
by the judgment in that suit. B would
have been the correct answer were it
not for the fact that Paul was neither
a party, nor in privity with a party, to
Pat's suit against Don. A is incorrect be-
cause it cannot be determined from the
jury's general verdict for Don whether
the jury actually found that Pat did not
own Blackacre (and therefore cannot
recover against Don) or that Don did not
come upon Blackacre (and, therefore,
Pat cannot recover against Don even
if Pat owned Blackacre). D is incor-
rect because the mutuality of estoppel
doctrine does not prohibit collateral
estoppel from being invoked against a
stranger (the Due Process clause does
that), but prohibits a stranger from in-
voking collateral estoppel. (Further, the
mutuality rule is no longer an absolute
bar to a stranger using collateral estop-
pel in federal court).

51. B is the correct answer. Notice pleading
rules require only a short and plain state-
ment of the claim showing the pleader is
entitled to relief. Particularized facts are
not required. Paul should have the right
to conduct discovery into the particular
defects, if any, and Flexus will then be
able to discover (e.g., through conten-
tion interrogatories) the details of Paul's
conclusory contentions. A is incorrect
for the reasons that B is correct. C is
incorrect because Rule 12(b)(6) permits
Flexus to attack the sufficiency of the
complaint in its answer if it had not pre-
viously made a pre-answer motion. D is
incorrect because, unlike state "special
appearance" practice, Federal Rule 12
allows a defendant to assert the insuf-
ficiency of the complaint as a defense
in the answer (along with denials).

52. C is the correct answer. Flexus's refusal
to disclose was based upon its argument
that Paul's complaint did not allege with
particularity the parts of Paul's car that
were defective. Rule 26 (a)(1) no longer
requires that disputed facts be alleged
with particularity in order to trigger
disclosure obligations. Flexus has a
duty to disclose to Paul the identity of
each individual likely to have discover-
able information that Flexus may use to
support its defenses to Paul's action. A
and B are incorrect for the reason C is
correct. D is incorrect because the infor-
mation requested is plainly relevant.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 129

56. A is the correct answer. Under the
more liberal federal standard for grant-
ing summary judgment after Celotex,
most federal courts would probably
reject Larry's argument that, by trial,
he may be able to show that Joe signed
the lease. Joe has presented too much
corroborating evidence not to shift the
burden onto the respondent, Larry, to
show that he will be able to meet his
burden of production on the issue of
Joe's signature at trial. B is incorrect for
the reasons why A is correct. C is incor-
rect because a defendant can make a
summary judgment motion before filing
an answer (See Rule 56). D is incorrect
because, after Celotex, a movant does
not have to negate every possible way
the respondent might meet their burden
of production on the material issue.

57. C is the correct answer. This is a res
judicata question. When Larry filed
suit, on June 1, 1992, Larry's "cause
of action" did not include his claim for
the May rent which was then due and
owing. Since Larry only asserted his
claims for the March and April rents,
but not the May rent, Larry "split his
cause of action" and is, therefore, pre-
cluded from asserting his claim for the
May rent in a subsequent action. B is
incorrect for the reasons that A is cor-
rect. A and D are incorrect because these
answers are inappropriate given the fact
that the real issue is not summary judg-
ment per se, but res judicata.  

A

53. D is the correct answer. Rule 26(b)(4)(A)
provides that all experts who will be
testifying witnesses at trial may be de-
posed. There is no requirement that the
discovering party serve interrogatories
beforehand. These former prelimi-
nary requirements were eliminated by
amendments to Rule 26(b)(4) effective
in December 1993. A is incorrect be-
cause Rule 26(b)(4) recognizes Paul's
legitimate need to depose Egbert in
order to prepare for Egbert's cross-ex-
amination at trial. B is incorrect for the
reasons that D is correct. C is incorrect
because the question of the protection
of the facts and opinions of an expert
is a Rule 26(b)(4) issue, not a 26(b)(3)
work product issue. The work product
rule does not cover "facts."

54. A is the correct answer. Rule 26(a) gives
Flexus a choice either to identify the
documents in question or to provide
Paul with actual copies of those docu-
ments. Therefore, B and D are incorrect.
C is an incorrect statement of the law
under Rule 26(a).

55. D is the correct answer. Rule 26(a)(3)
requires Paul to disclose his trial wit-
nesses at least 30 days before trial
without the need for Flexus to serve a
discovery request. Therefore, B is in-
correct. A and C are incorrect because
the issue here is not one of discovery,
under Rule 26(b), but of automatic
disclosure under Rule 26(a).

130 CIVIL PROCEDURE

58. D is the correct answer. C is correct
because a summary judgment is a judg-
ment "on the merits" which precludes
Larry from re-litigating the issue of
whether Joe signed the lease. In grant-
ing summary judgment, the judge
actually and necessarily determined,
based upon documentary evidence and
as a matter of law, that Joe did not sign
the lease. B also supports dismissing
Larry's current suit against Joe (for
the May rent) for the same reason that
the court dismissed Larry's prior suit
against Pete (for the May rent), i.e.
Larry should have included his claim
for the May rent in his suit against Pete
and Joe commenced June 1, 1994. A is
incorrect because res judicata does not
require a plaintiff to join as defendants
all persons liable to that plaintiff.

59. D is the best answer because the condi-
tion of the water heater from month-to-
month may change (it may have worked
in March and April, but only failed
in May) so that the issue whether the
water heater was functioning in March
and April is not identical with whether
it was functioning in May. Because the
issue is not identical, choices A, B and
C are not the best answers.

60. B is the correct answer. Anon-party has
an unqualified right to get a copy of his
own witness statement and a party has
an unqualified right to get a copy of
his own witness statement. But, a party
does not have an unqualified right to get
a copy of a non-party's witness state-
ment. Pat will have to ask Joe to request
from Plucky's a copy of Joe's witness
statement and to give it to Pat. A and
C are incorrect for the reasons stated
supporting B. D is incorrect because it
assumes that the witness statement is
not even "work product" because Sam
is not a lawyer. As long as Sam obtained
the statement "for" Plucky's, a party de-
fendant, in anticipation of litigation, the
statement falls within the work product
rule.

61. B is most nearly correct because Lou
obtained the witness statement from
Wally presumably in anticipation of
litigation. A is incorrect because Wally
was not Lou's client. C is incorrect be-
cause Wally was an eyewitness to the
accident. D is incorrect because there is
no basis for a claim of confidentiality
(e.g., that Wally would somehow be
harmed by disclosure of his statement)
and, in any event, Wally should have
moved for a protective order for confi-
dentiality protection. 

CIVIL PROCEDURE 131

A

62. C is the correct answer. The subsequent
remedial measures exclusionary rule
operates only at trial to bar the admis-
sion of evidence, not at the discovery
phase. The issue here is "discover-
abilty," not "admissibility" (of evidence
at trial). The general scope of discovery
rule [26(b)(1)] states that information
is not necessarily beyond the scope
of discovery simply because it will
be inadmissible as evidence at trial
(as long as it is reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence). A is incorrect because Ed's
memo was not prepared in anticipation
of litigation. B is incorrect because the
work product rule protects documents
prepared to prosecute or defend a
lawsuit, not to prevent one. D is incor-
rect because the subsequent remedial
measures rule operates only at trial to
exclude evidence.

132 CIVIL PROCEDURE

63. D is the correct answer because (1)
the presence of refuse on the floor of
Plucky's Anaheim Hills supermarket is
relevant to the cause of Pat's accident,
(2) the dominant purpose behind the
report's preparation was to record the
results of a health investigation. While
it is true that there is a dual purpose
here, i.e., to promote sanitary conditions
(the mission of the Health Department)
and to prepare for a possible suit by the
Health Dept. against Plucky's for viola-
tions of the Health Code, the question
is: what was the dominant purpose? If
the former, then the report is not pro-
tected. In any event, the report is not
protected as work product, even if the
latter purpose was dominant, because
the report was not prepared by any of
the parties to the Pat v. Plucky lawsuit
for use in litigating that suit. Therefore,
A and C are incorrect. B is incorrect
because there is nothing in the facts to
suggest that the Health Dept. report is
confidential.

64. A is the correct answer. Although Sam's
report itself is protected by work prod-
uct immunity, the underlying facts that
Sam learned during his investigation
of the accident are not. The same is
true for the attorney-client privilege.
There, only the "communication" itself
(here, Sam's report) is protected from
disclosure, not the underlying informa-
tion. Thus, B and D are incorrect. C is
not the best answer mainly because, to
invoke the court's discretionary protec-
tion, Plucky's should have moved for a
protective order. 

67. D is the correct answer. The issue here
is whether the court can assert supple-
mental jurisdiction over General's
cross-claim, since the cross-claim is
not supported by either diversity or
federal question jurisdiction (state tort
claim for contribution between two
Californians). Under prior case law,
federal courts could assert ancillary
jurisdiction over proper cross-claims.
General's cross-claim for contribution
is "proper" under Rule 13(g). The court
can assert "supplemental jurisdiction"
over the cross-claim because the claim
for contribution is clearly "related" to
Owner's main claim. Therefore, A and
B are incorrect. C is incorrect because
it addresses only the joinder issue and
ignores the subject matter jurisdiction
issue.

65. C is the correct answer. The jurisdic-
tional "amount in controversy" require-
ment is met since the claim against each
defendant was brought under the joint
and several liability theory thereby ex-
ceeding the required $75,000 amount .
The damages against each defendant are
not $40,000 but $80,000 each. A and B
are incorrect because they assume that
the damages against each defendant are
$40,000. A is also incorrect for the ad-
ditional reason that "same transaction
or occurrence" is an inapplicable rule
statement. D is incorrect for the reasons
why C is correct.

66. A is the correct answer. The City's coun-
terclaim is not supported by "diversity"
jurisdiction because the jurisdictional
amount in controversy is not satisfied.
Nor is the counterclaim supported by
"federal question" jurisdiction because,
under the "well-pleaded complaint
rule," the federal question must be
raised by an essential element of the
City's counterclaim, not by Owner's
response to that counterclaim. Further-
more, the court cannot assert supple-
mental jurisdiction over the counter-
claim because it is not related to the
subject matter of Owner's main claim
(in other words, it is not a compulsory
counterclaim). Therefore, B and C are
incorrect. D is incorrect because it has
no basis in law.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 133

69. A is the correct answer. Both Claims
#1 and #2 need supplemental jurisdic-
tion because they are each state claims
between two Californians. The court
can exercise supplemental jurisdiction
over Claim #1 because it is sufficiently
"related" to Owner's main claim (and,
under prior case law, federal courts have
exercised supplemental jurisdiction
over properly impleaded claims). How-
ever, even though Claim #2 is properly
joined under Rule 18, the court cannot
exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
this claim because it arises out of an-
other project and is, therefore, unrelated
to the subject matter of Owner's main
claim. Therefore, B, C and D are incor-
rect. 

A

68. A is the correct answer. Impleader is
improper because General's third-party
complaint asserts an "independent,"
instead of a "derivative" claim against
Archie. The claim is not derivative be-
cause General cannot be held liable, un-
der the law, for the misdeeds of Archie
- because General did not hire Archie;
Owner did! General's third-party claim
is independent of Owner's main claim
because General is not seeking indem-
nity from Archie in the event General
is found liable to Owner but, rather,
General is seeking to be compensated
for damage to its business (i.e., bank-
ruptcy). Thus, even if General is found
not liable to Owner, General can still
recover against Archie for destroying
General's business. Thus, C is incor-
rect. B is incorrect because General is a
Californian and Archie is a New Yorker
and the amount in controversy exceeds
$75,000. D is incorrect because there is
no supplemental jurisdiction issue since
the third-party claim is supported by
diversity jurisdiction.

70. C is the correct answer. The supplemen-
tal jurisdiction statute codifies the U.S.
Supreme Court's holding in the Kroger
case by stating that federal courts can-
not exercise supplemental jurisdiction
over a claim (like Owner's against Fred,
both New Yorkers), which is dependent
solely on diversity jurisdiction, where
the exercise of supplemental jurisdic-
tion would undermine (or be inconsis-
tent with) the requirements of complete
diversity. Here, Owner could not have
initially sued both General and Fred in
its original complaint because diversity
would have been incomplete. A is in-
correct because there is no basis in law
for this answer. B is incorrect because
it only addresses the joinder issue, and
not the jurisdictional. Because Owner's
claim against Fred does, indeed, arise
out of the same transaction and occur-
rence as Owner's claim against General,
that fact merely permits Owner, as a
joinder issue, to assert a claim directly
against Fred as a third-party defendant
brought in by General. Despite proper
joinder under Rule 14(a), however,
the supplemental jurisdiction statute
(codifying Kroger), does not permit the
court to assert supplemental jurisdiction
over this claim. D is incorrect because
subject matter jurisdiction can be chal-
lenged anytime during the litigation and
even on appeal.

71. A is the correct answer. When General
cross-claimed against the City for con-
tribution in the previous suit, the City's
claim for contribution should have
been asserted and joined by means of a
compulsory counterclaim. B is incorrect
because the City's contribution claim
would have been asserted against Gen-
eral as an "opposing party" (not merely
a "co-party") and, therefore, should be
characterized as a "counterclaim," not
a "cross-claim." C is incorrect because
no rule requires General to object to the
City's failure to assert its compulsory
counterclaim. D is incorrect for the
same reason why B is incorrect and for
the additional reason that cross-claims
are never compulsory.

72. D is the correct answer. The court has
federal question jurisdiction over all the
security and exchange violation claims
which arise under federal law. The
general federal question statute does
not require a jurisdictional "amount in
controversy." Therefore, A is incorrect
because aggregation is not an issue
since "amount in controversy" is not
an issue. B is incorrect since federal
question jurisdiction alone provides
an independent basis of subject matter
jurisdiction; diversity is not required.
C is incorrect for the additional reason
that it misstates the diversity rules.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 135

A

73. C is the correct answer because the only
relief sought was damage relief and the
only thing the class members have in
common is that they claim to have been
damaged in a similar way. A is incorrect
because the interests of neither class
members nor I.B.N. will be prejudiced
in a way specified in Rule 23(b)(1). B is
incorrect because the class is not seek-
ing injunctive relief. D is incorrect for
the reason that A is incorrect.

74. C is the correct answer because it accu-
rately tracks the notice rule [Rule 23(c)]
specifically applicable to 23(b)(3)
damage class actions. A and B omit
some part of this notice rule. D is not
authorized by Rule 23(c).

75. A is the correct answer. Joe's dual status
as class representative and as attorney
for the class poses a potential conflict of
interest. As counsel for the class, Joe's
interest is in maximizing his attorney's
fees so that, for example, as class
representative, he would not oppose
a settlement agreement that provided
for big attorney fees at the expense of
respectable damages for the class. B, C
and D are, therefore, incorrect.

76. A is the correct answer. As set forth
in Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders
(1978) 437 U.S. 340, that the cost of
notice shall be borne by the representa-
tive plaintiff, not by the defendant and
judicial attempts to improvise beyond
the express letter of the rule have been
rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court
(See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jaquelin).
Therefore, B, C and D are incorrect.

77. A is the correct answer because Don's
wealth is not relevant to the subject
matter of Paula's lawsuit. It has no
bearing on the issues of liability or
recoverable damages; solely on the
defendant's ability to pay a judgment.
As such, the information in the report
is not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence.
Since the information in the report is
irrelevant, A is the best answer and,
consequently, B, C and D are not. C is
incorrect for the additional reason that
the report was not prepared in anticipa-
tion of litigation but, rather, to help Don
prepare his will. D is incorrect for the
additional reason that the report was not
prepared by the accountant in anticipa-
tion of litigation.  

136 CIVIL PROCEDURE

78. A is the correct answer. Rule 26(a), re-
garding automatic "disclosure" obliga-
tions of parties, requires that an expert
who has been retained by a party to
provide expert testimony at trial prepare
a detailed report regarding that pro-
posed trial testimony. Rule 26(b)(4)(A)
unconditionally permits the deposition
of experts who are designated to pro-
vide trial testimony, but requires that
such deposition not take place before
the report [required by Rule 26(a)] is
received by the deposing party. B is
incorrect because Rule 26(b)(4)(A) no
longer requires the service of special
interrogatories as a pre-condition to a
motion to depose the expert witness.
C is incorrect because the rule it cites
applies only to retained or specially
employed non-testifying experts. D is
wrong for the reason why A is correct.

A
OC

79. D is the correct answer. While it is true
that determination of witness credibility
is the jury's job, even if the jury believes
Eggbert's testimony, the jury could only
"speculate" (i.e., flip a mental coin),
based solely upon that testimony, that
Don caused the accident by crossing
into Paul's lane. This is true since the
expert testified only that Don's truck
"could well have" veered into Paul's
lane, not that it is likely that he did so.
Also, on cross-examination, Eggbert
conceded that it was equally possible
that Paul's truck veered into Don's lane.
Therefore, B is incorrect. C is incorrect
because, as already explained, the jury
could not rationally find in favor of
Paula, who has the burden of produc-
tion on liability; therefore, there is no
conflict in the evidence. A is incorrect
because, under current Rule 50, a mo-
tion for a judgment as a matter of law
can be made as soon as the respondent
has been fully heard on the material
issue that is the subject of the motion.

80. B is the correct answer. Although the
affidavit of Willy's ex-wife indicates
that the condition of Willy's eyes are
"in controversy," Willy cannot be
compelled to submit to an eye exami-
nation because he is only a non-party
witness (neither a party nor a person in
the custody or under the legal control
of a party.) Therefore, A, C and D are
incorrect.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

137

A

81. B is the correct answer because Del's re-
cord of reckless driving could be the re-
sult of any number of reasons and does
not point specifically to poor reflexes or
some form of mental illness. Therefore,
Pam has not met the "in controversy"
requirement of Rule 35. A is incorrect
because an employee is not deemed to
be within the custody or legal control
of his employer. C is incorrect because
it only establishes the relevance of any
information relating to Del's ability to
drive a vehicle but does not address
the "in controversy" requirement. D is
incorrect because Pam's attorney's affi-
davit is based upon personal knowledge
of the contents of the court files.

82. A is the correct answer. Since Pam has
made an offensive summary judgment
motion, she has the heavy movant's
burden of showing conclusively that
Del ran the red light which Willy's
affidavit fails to do. While Willy's af-
fidavit shows that, had the light at the
intersection in question been red for
Del, he probably would have run it, the
odds are only 50-50 that the light was
red for Del . Had it been green, then
Del's contempt for red lights would not
have been the cause of this collision.
Therefore, Willy's affidavit does not
provide a basis for a reasonable infer-
ence that Del caused the accident, let
alone conclusively establish that fact.
B is incorrect because Acme does not
have a respondent's burden because
Pam failed to meet her movant's bur-
den. C is incorrect because there is not
a two-sided fact issue on causation
because Pam did not present enough
evidence to support a rational inference
that Del caused the collision. D contains
an incorrect statement of the law. 

138 CIVIL PROCEDURE

83. C is the correct answer. As a prerequisite
for a renewed motion for judgment as
a matter of law, the movant must have
previously made a motion for a judg-
ment as a matter of law by the close of
all the evidence. Pam did not do this.
While it is true that, even if she had so
moved, her renewed motion would still
have been denied because the jury has
the right to believe the twice convicted
perjurer over the two bishops, this was
not one of the choices given in the
question. A is an incorrect statement of
the law. B is incorrect because, in order
for Pam to win her motion, she must
show that she did more than merely
meet her burden of production, but that
she proved her case conclusively. Only
then would the burden of production
have shifted to Acme. D is incorrect
(1) because the term "overwhelmed"
is properly used only to describe the
situation where plaintiff has barely
met her burden of production and the
defendant's evidence is so strong that
it "overwhelms" plaintiff's case enti-
tling defendant to a defensive motion
for judgment as a matter of law; and
(2) because there was a conflict in the
evidence, thus, creating a two-sided
credibility issue for the jury.

A
0 0< 

84. D is the correct answer. Federal Rule of
Evidence 606(b) bars any inquiry into
the thought processes of jurors (which
would include "bias"). The same is true
for the Mansfield Rule and the Iowa
Rule (which would consider "bias"
intrinsic misconduct and, therefore, not
provable). A is incorrect because there
is a recent trend toward close appellate
scrutiny, and some reversals, of orders
granting new trials. B is incorrect be-
cause the trial judge's order granting the
motion for judgment as a matter of law
is a "final judgment" and Rule 50 ex-
pressly states that the conditional grant
of a new trial motion does not change
the situation. C is incorrect because it
fails to take account of D.

85. A is the correct answer. Complete di-
versity exists because Pam is a citizen
of Nevada (her home is in Las Vegas)
and Beers is a California citizen. The
amount in controversy is satisfied
because Pam claims $105,000 in dam-
ages and Beers cannot prove to a legal
certainty that she cannot recover that
amount. B is incorrect because solicit-
ing business in Nevada does not make
Beers a Nevada citizen. C is incorrect
because Pam does not have to prove to a
legal certainty that she will recover her
damages including pain and suffering.
It is the defendant who has to prove to a
legal certainty that Pam cannot recover
over $75,000 in order to convince the
court that it does not have diversity
jurisdiction. D is incorrect because Dar-
ren is not a party to the suit.

CIVIL PROCEDURE 139

A

86. D is the correct answer. When Beers
made its pre-answer motion to dismiss
on subject matter jurisdiction grounds, it
should have also included its objection
to personal jurisdiction. See F.R.C.P.
12(h). Since it did not, it has waived its
personal jurisdiction defense and it is,
therefore, too late to assert that defense
as an affirmative defense in its answer.
A is incorrect for two reasons: Although
Beers purposefully availed itself of the
Nevada market by soliciting Nevada
student business, which satisfies the
Due Process clause, (i) Nevada's long
arm statute does not authorize its courts
to exercise personal jurisdiction in this
case because the tortious act of serving
Darren occurred outside Nevada and (ii)
Beers waived its personal jurisdiction
defense, as shown above. B is incorrect
because Beers did solicit business from
Nevada students and Beers waived its
personal jurisdiction defense. C would
have been correct but for the fact that
Beers waived its personal jurisdiction
defense.

87. A is the correct answer. Res judicata
precludes Pam from asserting her claim
for property damage against Beers in a
second suit because the default judg-
ment against Beers is a valid (the court
found that it had personal jurisdiction
and there was no appeal on that issue)
final judgment "on the merits" (a de-
fault judgment is deemed to operate
as though it were "on the merits") and,
applying the "same transaction" defi-
nition of "cause of action" applicable
in federal court, Pam split her cause
of action. B is incorrect because a
default judgment is deemed to operate
as though it were "on the merits." C is
incorrect because the "rights" test is
inapplicable in federal court. D is in-
correct because the fact that a plaintiff
who, in good faith, claims over $75,000
in her complaint receives a verdict for
less than $75,000 does not divest the
court of subject matter jurisdiction to
enter judgment on the verdict. 

140 CIVIL PROCEDURE

88. D is the correct answer. Under the Ter-
ritoriality Rule, personal service upon
Darren in the forum state of California
is a valid basis under the Due Process
clause for the California court to exer-
cise personal jurisdiction over Darren.
A is incorrect because, under a mini-
mum contacts analysis, Pam's claim
against Darren arises out of his driving
inside Nevada, not California. B is in-
correct for the reason that D is correct
and, also, because Darren is a California
citizen. C is incorrect: (i) because it
focuses upon "fair play and substantial
justice" or "litigation fairness" rather
than purposeful availment and, (ii) in
any event, personal jurisdiction over
Darren is constitutional under the Ter-
ritoriality Rule and because Darren is
a California citizen.

89. A is the correct answer. Darren keeps
his California citizenship until he
changes it for a new one. Although
Darren is a college student in Nevada,
this does not necessarily constitute an
intent by Darren to change his domi-
cile to Nevada. Since Pam is a Nevada
citizen, complete diversity exists. B is
incorrect for the reason that A is cor-
rect. C is incorrect because it is based
upon an incorrect rule of law. Diversity
jurisdiction is not affected by whether
a defendant is a citizen of the forum
state. This answer confuses diversity
jurisdiction with removal jurisdiction.
D is incorrect because subject matter
jurisdiction is not waived during the
life of the original lawsuit.

90. A is the correct answer. The res judicata
issue presented here is whether Pam
should have asserted a claim for damage
to her car against Darren alongside her
claim for car damage against Beers. Res
judicata does not require a plaintiff to
join every tortfeasor against her in the
same lawsuit. B is incorrect because
the defense of res judicata does not
have to be included (indeed, it cannot
be included) in a pre-answer motion. C
is incorrect for the reason why A is cor-
rect. D is incorrect because the 9/1/92
judgment dismissing Pam's suit against
Beers was an involuntary dismissal that
is deemed to be "on the merits." See
F.R.C.P. 41(b).

91. C is the correct answer. C is the only
choice that is not correct. A is a correct
statement because Darren was not a
party nor in privity with a party in Pam
v. Beers. B is a correct statement be-
cause the 7/1/92 judgment was a default
judgment; no facts were determined. D
is a correct statement because mutuality
only applies to the assertion of collat-
eral estoppel by a stranger. Pam is no
stranger to her suit against Beers. C is
incorrect because, as stated previously,
a default judgment is deemed to operate
as though it were "on the merits."

92. D is the correct answer. The federal
court has "alienage" jurisdiction over
the claim by Jacques, a citizen of a
foreign state (i.e., France), against Don,
a citizen of California, and "diversity"
jurisdiction over the claim of Jill, an
Arizona citizen, against Don, a Califor-
nian. Jill is still an Arizonan because her
student status in California does not in-
dicate her intention to live in California
for the foreseeable future. Therefore, A
is incorrect. (A is also incorrect because,
even if Jill were deemed to be a Cali-
fornia citizen, that would undermine
subject matter jurisdiction over Jacques'
claim as well and the court would,
therefore, have to dismiss both claims.)
B is incorrect because the principle that
a woman takes on the domicile of her
husband is not applicable to the ques-
tion of "state domicile" for purposes of
the diversity statute. C is incorrect for
the reason why D is correct.

93. D is the correct answer. In 2005, the U.S.
Supreme Court (Exxon Mobil Corp. v.
Allapatah Services) adopted a literal
interpretation of the Supplemental Ju-
risdiction statute allowing supplemental
jurisdiction over claims by plaintiffs
that do not exceed the $75,000 amount
in controversy requirement so long
as at least one co-plaintiff or named
class representative has a jurisdiction-
ally sufficient claim Therefore, A is
incorrect. B is incorrect because the
aggregation rule otherwise applicable
in this situation has been superseded
by the Supplemental Jurisdiction stat-
ute. C is incorrect because Jill's claim
does meet the jurisdictional amount in
controversy. 

142 CIVIL PROCEDURE

94. C is the correct answer. Hanna v.
Plumer states that, under the Supremacy
Clause, when there is federal law (U.S.
Constitution, federal statute or F.R.C.P.)
on point, that law governs over any
conflicting state law. Therefore, since
the 7th Amendment to the U.S. Con-
stitution guarantees Jacques and Jill's
right to trial by jury of their damage
claims, this right cannot be undercut
in federal court by the California state
law on punitive damages. Therefore,
A is incorrect because, under the Su-
premacy Clause, the 7th Amendment
prevails over the California state law
despite the important substantive state
interests behind the state law. B is incor-
rect for reasons stated in the discussion
of choice C. D is incorrect for three
reasons: (i) the outcome determinative
test is irrelevant to the application of
the Supremacy Clause; (ii) even if one
could apply the outcome determinative
test, there could well be a difference
between a judge and a jury trial of the
punitive damage issue (the California
legislature thought this was so); and (iii)
applying the outcome determinative
test, assuming there were no difference
in outcome, the result would be to ap-
ply the federal rule rather than the state
rule.

A

CP 

95. B is the correct answer. In determin-
ing the res judicata effect of the fed-
eral court judgment entered 4/1/93, the
California court must apply the federal
definition of "cause of action," which
is the "same transaction" test. Applying
that test, Jacques should have joined his
personal injury claim alongside his loss
of consortium claim since both claims
arose out of the auto collision. There-
fore, A is incorrect, since it applies the
"primary rights" test. C is incorrect
because it relies on the theory-oriented
primary rights test. D is incorrect be-
cause husband and wife are not per se
in privity with each other.

96. B is the correct answer. In the prior
federal court suit, the jury did not
state its findings upon which it based
its verdict for Don on Jacques' loss of
consortium claim. The jury could have
found that Jacques was contributorily
negligent. But it could well have found
that Jacques failed to prove damages,
since his damage evidence was "mini-
mal" and Don had offered substantial
evidence that Jacques' marriage was
"in trouble." Therefore, it cannot be
determined whether the jury actually
determined that Jacques was contribu-
torily negligent. Therefore, A and B are
incorrect. D is incorrect because there
is no indication in the facts that Jacques
did not have a "full and fair opportunity
to litigate."

CIVIL PROCEDURE 143

A

97. A is the correct answer. A is the only
choice that is "not correct." DeWinter
is seeking to use the prior criminal
judgment of acquittal bind Floyd's who
was a stranger to that criminal pro-
ceeding. This is prohibited by the Due
Process Clause, not by the mutuality
of estoppel rule. Mutuality of estoppel
prevents the use of collateral estoppel
by a stranger to the previous suit. B is
true for reasons just explained. C is true
because the only finding the jury made
in acquitting DeWinter is that there was
a "reasonable doubt" that he murdered
his wife. They could still have believed,
by a preponderance of the evidence,
that he killed her. In DeWinter's suit
against Floyd's, the applicable burden
of persuasion is "preponderance of the
evidence." D is true for reasons just
explained.

98. D is the correct answer. DeWinter has
the burden of production on the issue of
the cause of Rebecca's death; therefore,
DeWinter's motion for judgment as a
matter of law is being used offensively.
For DeWinter to win his motion, it is
not enough that he meet his burden of
production, but he must prove conclu-
sively that Rebecca fell off the cliff.
This he failed to do since the testimony
of DeWinter and his new wife, Cecily,
are potentially biased and interested
and, therefore, the jury may well choose
to disbelieve them. Even without con-
tradictory witnesses, credibility is an is-
sue for the jury to decide. Furthermore,
no inferences may be drawn against
Floyd's for failing to produce any con-
tradictory witnesses since there were no
other eyewitnesses to Rebecca's death.
The burden of production did not shift
to Floyd's on the issue of Rebecca's
death. For the above reasons, A and C
are incorrect. B is also incorrect because
sometimes courts have been known, in
rare cases, to grant offensive motions
for judgment as a matter of law based
upon testimonial evidence. 

144 CIVIL PROCEDURE

99. B is the correct answer. Since DeWinter,
the plaintiff, is a British subject and
Floyd's, the defendant, is a California
citizen, the federal court has alienage
jurisdiction to enter judgment upon the
jury's verdict. A is incorrect because
subject matter jurisdiction can be chal-
lenged even on appeal. C is incorrect
because DeWinter is not a California
domiciliary. In order to be a domiciliary
of a state of the U.S., one must also be a
U.S. citizen. D is incorrect because the
court, having alienage jurisdiction, does
not need federal question jurisdiction to
enter judgment.

100. D is the correct answer. A new trial mo-
tion must be made no later than 10 days
after entry of judgment. Here, Floyd's
waited three weeks. Had the motion
been timely, A would have been cor-
rect. Had the motion been timely, B
still would have been incorrect because
the judge could reasonably infer from
the content of Juliet's affidavit that it
could well have swayed the verdict. C
is incorrect because it states the wrong
rule of law, i.e., the Iowa Rule instead
of Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b).

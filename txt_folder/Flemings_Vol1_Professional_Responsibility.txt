Questions 15 -16 are based on the
following facts:

Lawyer Breebar has just passed and been
admitted to the bar, after having failed it
three times prior. Breebar decides to set up
his own personal injury practice, even
though he has virtually no experience in this
area.

Breebar rents office space, hires a secretary
and places advertisements. Soon thereafter
Client Herb calls Breebar regarding an auto
accident case. The case seems relatively
straightforward, so Breebar accepts the rep 
resentation. However, the more Breebar
looks into the facts, the more confused he
becomes.

Months pass. Herb calls Breebar repeatedly,
but Breebar does not return his phone calls.
Instead Breebar consoles himself by hang 
ing out at the beach. Breebar ultimately de 
cides to get out of law and become a profes 
sional surfer.

15. When Breebar opened up a law office

bar, he is:

A. Subject to discipline because he
is per se incompetent in this le

theory of neglect.

B. Subject to discipline because he
has decided not to practice law.

C. Not subject to discipline because
there is no actual prejudice.

D. Not subject to discipline because
Breebar is no longer functioning

Lawyer Rob represents Client Loon. Loon
is charged with the statutory offense of
"Driving an Automobile while under the
Influence of Alcohol." Rob has performed
an excellent job. He has investigated the ar 
resting officer, has had an expert examine
the breathalyzer test utilized by the police,
and has assembled a host of witnesses indi 
cating that Loon is personally against the use
of all drugs, including alcohol. However,
there is one problem. Loon talks with a slight
lisp and tends to be snide when he is ques 
tioned. Rob, therefore, decides that Loon
must not take the stand in his own defense.
Loon insists that he be so allowed. The trial
ends with Loon fully acquitted - even though
he does not take the stand.

17. Should Rob have let Loon take the

stand?

A. Yes, because this is an area of

client decision.

B. Yes, because a client's funda 
mental desires should always be
followed.

C. Yes, because the jury may have
drawn an adverse conclusion
from Loon's silence.

Questions 21 â€” 30 are based on the
following facts:   

Lawyer Linda is in practice in a large city.
She charges $10,000 to go to trial on a charge
of drunk driving. She requires this money
be paid up front. Linda has been in practice
for 15 years and enjoys a fine reputation in
the community. Fifty miles outside of the
city Lawyer Chip does the same work for
$2,000. Linda seals her client contracts with
a handshake, only. Chip always commits his
contracts to writing. 

On one occasion, Client Bingo sought the
services of Linda. Linda refused because
Bingo could not afford the $10,000. Bingo
then sought the services of Chip. Bingo told
Chip that he could not afford even $2,000.
Chip felt sorry for Bingo and agreed to de-
fend him against the charge of drunk driv-
ing "for $500 now and if you are acquitted
you can pay me $1500 when you are able."
Bingo is convicted and Chip does not bill
him for the $1500.

A short time later, Client Moxy seeks the
services of Linda. Linda decides to repre-
sent Moxy against a drunk driving charge
for only $1000. Linda does this because
Moxy is hard-pressed to find the money.

After the Bingo case, Client Rex comes in
to see Chip, with a similar problem. Because
Rex is wealthy and because Chip is having
a cash-flow problem, Chip decides to bill
Rex $5000 for the defense. This fee is not
unusual for Chip's community, but it is the
first time Chip has set his billing so high.

PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 377

    
Unfortunately, the Rex case turns out to be
highly complex. Chip calls Linda to see if
she is willing to help out. Linda agrees, as
does Rex. The fee is not raised and the cli 
ent agrees to this arrangement in writing.
Chip and Linda spend equal time on Rex's
case and split the fee equally.

jects her to possible discipline.

B.

C.

Is probably not excessive and
thus is proper.

Is totally within his own discre

C.

I, II, III and IV only.

D. I, II, III, IV and V.

23. Linda's method of sealing her contracts

with a handshake only is:

A. In violation of the rules.

B. Proper, but not preferred.

C. Proper, and preferred.

D. Improper.

24. Linda's refusal to represent Bingo:

A. Is proper because rarely are at-
torneys required to accept cli-
ents.

B.

Is in technical violation of the
rules.

C. Depends on whether this juris-
diction follows the ABA Model
Rules.

D. Is in violation of the disciplin-

C. Is a violation of the rules, under

D. Subjects Chip to discipline.

26. Chip and Linda's billing some clients

more money than others:

I. Is proper because attor-
neys need not bill the
same amounts.

II. Subjects each of them to 	
discipline, because al-
	though different attor-

amounts to different cli- 	
ents, each individual at-
	torney must bill the same 	
amount to every client 	
who has similar legal

se violative of the norms of the
profession.

B. Yes, because the fee split was not
in proportion to the actual work
performed.

C. Yes, because Rex did not consent

to the fee split. 

D. No.

28. With regard to Chip's fee split with
Linda, it would have been preferable for
Chip:

I. To have asked Rex if he
could call another attor-

following facts:

Kibbles approaches Lawyer Alfalfa in order
to secure her services. Alfalfa agrees to rep

civil suit based on an alleged contractual
misrepresentation Kibbles made to Sprout.
At one point, Kibbles says, "If this [exple

someone to kill Sprout."

Alfalfa tells Kibbles, "Do not do that. It will
only make your problems worse."

Kibbles responds, "Perhaps so, but I'm get

I mean it."

Alfalfa does nothing, and unfortunately
Sprout is murdered, apparently by Kibbles.

31. Which of the following is most correct?

A. Alfalfa is subject to discipline,
because she was required to re 
veal the danger to Sprout.

B. Alfalfa is subject to discipline,

lIB PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTY

3. A is the correct answer. Judges must
refrain from criticisms of jurors and
must also refrain from ex parte confer 
ences absent exigencies (and there was
no exigency here). CJC 3B(7)(a);
3B(lO). Judges must maintain de 
meanor and professionalism. Criticism
of any party absent their misconduct
destroys that professionalism. Further,
under our adversary system, ex parte
conferences are believed to create not
only an appearance of impropriety but
actual impropriety in that the other ad 
vocate does not have a chance to de 
fend his or her position. B, C and Dare
incorrect for the same reasons that A is
correct.

4. C is the correct answer. A judge who
must seek reelection is permitted to
promise impartiality. He or she is not
permitted to promise a result in a spe 
cific case. CJC 5A(3)(d)(i). A and Dare
incorrect for the same reasons that C is
correct. B is incorrect because although
a judge is granted certain first amend 
ment freedom of speech protection, this
radical promise is beyond the first
amendment freedom allowed.

PROFESSIONAL
RESPONSIBILITY
ANSWERS

1. D is the correct answer. A judge, even
with another judge's approval, is not
permitted to be a character witness. See,
ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct
[CJC] 2B. As such, a judge has unnec 
essarily put him or herself in a position
of appearing biased or prejudiced and
has placed him or herself in a role more
of a lay citizen. A is incorrect under the
ABA Code because not all judicial rules
are discretionary. B is incorrect because
consent of a superior does not relieve a
lawyer or a judge from personal respon 
sibilities. C is incorrect because judges
certainly can be disciplined.

2. C is the correct answer. CJC 4C(2) in 
dicates that it is improper for a sitting
judge to serve on a government com 
mission. Although the prestige of the
judge's position will add weight to the
credibility of the commission, again this
is thought to be a compromise of judi 
cial impartiality. A, though arguably
giving a correct statement of interpre 
tation, is incorrect because the rules are
to the contrary. B is incorrect because
the mere fact that the judge is not paid
does not relieve the judge of his or her
ethical responsibility. D is incorrect
because serving on such a commission
is not, per se, undignified.

PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBIUTY II

5. D is the correct answer. Advertisements
must not be misleading. ABA Model
Rules of Professional Conduct Model
Rule [MR] 7.1; ABA Model Code of
Professional Responsibility, Disciplin 
ary Rule [DR] 2-101. Since a statement
that a lawyer has never lost a case, even
if true, is misleading - since it sets up
an unreasonable expectation regarding
cases which no lawyer could win;
Quinn's ad is in violation of the rules.
A and B are incorrect because lawyer
advertising is given limited First
Amendment protection. C is incorrect
because there is no requirement, as yet,
that lawyer ads appear in a dignified
forum. Such is, of course, preferable,
but it is not mandatory.

6. C is the correct answer. Lawyers must
not lie on their bar applications. Such
shows a lack of good character, which
subjects an attorney to discipline. MR
8.1; DR 1-101(A). Discipline is not for
the purpose of punishment. Rather, it is
to protect the public from dangerously
inept or corrupt attorneys. Moreover,
there are no statutes of limitations re 
garding disciplining attorneys. Thus, C
is correct and A and D are incorrect. B
is incorrect because it is permissible to
discipline an attorney for past acts un 
related to her present psychological
state.

7. C is the correct answer. A lawyer must
turn in his delinquent peers provided
what they know is unprivileged. MR
8.3(a); DR 1-103(A). Thus, C is cor 
rect and A and B are incorrect. D is in 
correct for two reasons: first Joe is not
in good faith and second, good faith is
not an excuse for this kind of violation.
(Note: California has no like require 
ment.)

8. D is the correct answer. A state can dis 
cipline a lawyer for actions performed
anywhere, if such actions involve moral
turpitude. Since manslaughter is mor 
ally wrong, discipline is acceptable. MR
8.4; MR 8.5; DR 1-102(A)(3). There 
fore, D is correct and A and B are in 
correct. C is incorrect because the ac 
tions of moral turpitude need not be di 
rectly related to the practice of law.

9. A is the correct answer. Judges should
not be character witnesses. Such ap 
pears improper. CJC 2B. Therefore A
is correct and D is incorrect. B is incor 
rect because judges may on occasion
be required to testify, e.g., if they are a
party to their own litigation. C is incor 
rect because Slip's good or bad charac 
ter is not the issue. The issue is whether
the judge is permitted to testify.

10. B is the correct answer. Ex parte com 
munications between a judge and juror
are not preferable. If such occur, all
parties to the litigation should be given
notice. CJC 3B. Thus, B is correct and
A, C and D are incorrect.

m:I PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTV

11. C is the correct answer because only
choice I is correct. Ajudge is permitted
to teach law and be paid. Thus, II and
III are incorrect and I is correct. How 
ever, judges should make a public re 
port of their extra judicial income. CJC
4B,H.

12. C is the correct answer. Judges are per 
mitted to manage and participate in a
business primarily engaged in invest 
ment of the judge's financial resources.
Thus, C is correct and A and B are in 
correct. D is incorrect because the busi 
ness can be related to law, e.g., law
teaching. CJC 4D.

13. C is the correct answer. Judges are per 
mitted to receive gifts related to ordi 
nary hospitality such as birthday pre 
sents. Only when the gift creates an
appearance of impropriety should it be
refused. CJC 4D. A, Band D are, there 
fore, incorrect and C is correct. (Note:
the call of this question is phrased in
the negative.)

14. A is the correct answer. Judges, when
campaigning for office, generally
should not make pledges regarding the
way they would sentence CJC SA.
However, the first amendment is appli 
cable to judges - so judges can take a
"law and order" stance. Thus, B is in 
correct. C is incorrect because ample
facts were given. D is incorrect because
the first amendment controls.

15. C is the correct answer. Passing the bar
exam, on its face, is proof of reason 
able competence. Perhaps where the
law is complex, a new lawyer could not
begin practice in that area. But in any
general area of law, new lawyers are
permitted to start right out. MR 1.1; DR
6-10 1. A is incorrect for the same rea 
son that C is correct. B is incorrect be 
cause no facts indicate that Breebar is
actually incompetent. D is incorrect
because no facts indicate that Breebar
is actually competent.

16. A is the correct answer. Lawyers must
neither neglect cases nor neglect their
clients. MR 1.3; DR 6-101(A)(3);
American Bar Association Model Code
of Professional Responsibility Ethical
Consideration [EC] 6-4. Not returning
client calls for months, as stipulated
here, is just cause for discipline. B is
obviously incorrect because lawyers are
free to discontinue their practice of law.
C is incorrect because the issue of in 
jury to the client is more an issue of tort
(malpractice) liability. There need be no
client prejudice for discipline to follow.
D is incorrect because, although it is
permissible for a lawyer to discontinue
the practice of law, he must take rea 
sonable steps to insure that his clients
are well taken care of. Breebar just
"goofed off."

PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY Em

17. A is the correct answer. As a general
rule, strategy is entirely within a
lawyer's discretion. There are, however,
certain fundamental choices which are
entirely to be made by the client.
Whether or not to take the stand is one
of those areas. MR 1.2(a); EC 7-7. Thus,
Rob should have let Loon testify. Here
the Model Rules require that the attor 
ney abide by the client's wishes regard 
ing whether or not to testify. (Under the
old Model Code, it is discretionary.) B
is incorrect because if a client disagrees
as to strategy, the lawyer may follow
his own decisions and desires. Coffers
a correct analysis of what the jury might
think regarding a defendant's silence.
But C is incorrect because the real is 
sue is not what the jury will think - it is
who gets to make the decision. D is in 
correct for the same reasons that A is
correct.

18. C is the correct answer. A lawyer must
not make use of perjured testimony. MR
3.3(a)(4); DR 7-102(A)(4.) Rob not
only makes use of the testimony - he
also aids in the fraud on the court. A
and D are incorrect for the same reason
that C is correct. B is incorrect because
a technical violation of the mandatory
rules subjects an attorney to discipline.
Of course, if it is merely a technical vio 
lation, the discipline will probably be
light, e.g., private reprimand only.

19. C is the correct answer. There is noth 
ing in the code which prohibits a law 
yer from charging low fees. To the con 
trary, lawyers are encouraged to com 
pete and to do work for free. MR 6.1;
EC 2-25. Thus, Epsilon's behavior is
within his own discretion and is, thus,
"proper." Choices A, Band D are in 
correct for the same reasons that C is
correct.

20. B is the correct answer, because choices
I and II are correct. Choice I is correct
because there is an exception to the rule
barring solicitation of clients when the
solicitation concerns a related matter to
which the lawyer had previously per 
formed work. MR 7.3; DR2-104(A)(1).
Choice II is correct because when a cli 
ent is to be prejudiced, the best course
of conduct is for the attorney to initiate
contact with that former client (on the
related matter). MR 1.3. Choice III is
incorrect because, although lawyers
"should" contact clients in like situa 
tions; such is within their discretion  
unless, of course, they tell the client that
they will periodically inspect the legal
document.

21. B is the correct answer. For the most
part, attorneys can set their own fees
which are permitted to be substantial,
within the broad parameters of reason 
ableness. MR 1.5; DR 2-106. A and D
are incorrect because although exces 
sive fees will subject an attorney to dis 
cipline, this fee was likely not exces 
sive. C is incorrect because attorney
fees must be reasonable.

Em PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTV

22. C is the correct answer, because choices
I, II, III and IV are correct. I is correct
because expertise is a factor in whether
the attorney fee is excessive v. reason 
able. II is correct because the attorney's
fame (reputation) is another legitimate
factor. III is obviously correct, because
the more difficult is the case, the higher
the fee can be. IV is correct because,
although not completely controlling, the
fees of similarly situated attorneys is
relevant in adjudging whether a particu 
lar attorney's fee is excessive. Choice
V is incorrect because Chip, a small
town attorney, is not similarly situated
to Linda. Thus, his fees are not relevant.
See generally MR 1.5; DR 2-106(A).

23. B is the correct answer. Although it is
preferable to reduce contracts with new
clients to writing, such is not manda 
tory. MR 1.5(b); EC 2-19. A, C and D
are incorrect for the same reasons that
B is correct. (Note: California law re 
quires fees of $1000 or over generally
be put in writing; the MPRE does not
test California law.)

24. A is the correct answer. Nothing in the
ABA code requires an attorney to ac 
cept all walk-in clients. Thus, Band C
are incorrect. D is incorrect because
nothing in the code requires an attor 
ney to bill all clients the same amount
for similar work. The fees need only be
reasonable - but not equal. MR 1.5; DR
2-106; EC 2-17. Such is obviously the
case because attorneys are encouraged
to perform some legal work for the poor
for no charge. MR 6.1; EC 2-25.

25. D is the correct answer. Allowing Bingo
to pay an additional $1500 only ifhe is
acquitted is essentially a contingency
fee contract. Contingency fee contracts
in criminal cases are per se prohibited.
MR 1.5(d)(2); DR 2-106(C). Chip's
good faith is no defense - thus, A and
B are incorrect. C is incorrect because
there is no Leon case relevant here.
(Note: California law does not, per se,
prohibit such an arrangement.)

26. A is the correct answer, because only
choice I is correct. Attorney fees need
only be reasonable, not equal - thus, I
is correct. MR 1.5; DR 2-106; EC 2-17.
II is incorrect for the same reason that I
is correct. III is incorrect because there
is no state action; thus, the Equal Pro 
tection Clause is not relevant.

27. D is the correct answer. Fee splits are
acceptable with attorneys outside the
firm if the client consents and the fee is
not raised. MR l.5(e); DR 2-107(A). A
is incorrect for the same reasons that D
is correct. B is incorrect because it mis 
reads the facts. This fee split was in pro 
portion to actual attorney work per 
formed. (Please note: the Model Code
requires an equal fee split; but the
Model Rules do not. Regardless of this
code difference, this answer is incorrect
because it misreads the facts.) C is in 
correct because Rex did consent.

PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY Em

28. A is the correct answer because only
choice I is correct. I is correct because
Chip really should have asked his cli 
ent prior to investigating the possibil 
ity of bringing another attorney aboard.
MR 1.5(e); DR 2-107(A). II is incor 
rect, because withdrawal is not neces 
sary. III is incorrect because the code
does not suggest that disproportionate
attorney fee splits are always preferable.

29. B is the correct answer. Although the
receipt of client chattels as fee is not
preferable, such is not prohibited. See
MR 1.5, Comment [2]. A, C and Dare
incorrect for the same reason that B is
correct.

30. D is the correct answer. When there is
a fee dispute between the lawyer and
client, the lawyer should recommend
arbitration. Such, however, is not re 
quired. See MR 1.5, Comment [5].
[Note: it would be a different fact-pat 
tern entirely, where the fee is in the trust
account of the attorney. Such is not the
case when the fee is paid up front, as
here.] A is incorrect for the same rea 
son that D is correct. B is incorrect be 
cause attorneys need not return fees
which they reasonably believe they
have earned. C is incorrect because at 
torneys must not threaten or harm cli 
ents so as to keep their fees which are
in dispute.

31. D is the correct answer. Somewhat sur 
prisingly, there is no requirement that
an attorney reveal an intended future
crime of her client. The option is given
if the crime involves physical danger
or corporate fraud under MR 1.6. There 
fore, D is correct. A is incorrect for the
same reason that D is correct. B is in 
correct because an attorney need only
withdraw when the crime (or fraud) is
on the court itself. C is incorrect because
it misreads the facts - the crime was
reasonably apparent.

32. B is the correct answer because only
choices I and IV are correct. I is correct
because an attorney is permitted to keep
to herself her client's spoken intent to
commit a future dangerous crime. MR
1.6(b)(l); DR 4-101(C)(3.) IV is cor 
rect because an attorney is permitted to
reveal a confidence if such is reason 
ably related to and reasonably neces 
sary to defense of herself. MR 1.6(b)(2);
DR 4-101(C)(4.) II is incorrect for the
same reasons that I and IV are correct.
III is incorrect because it gives the
wrong reason for the permission to re 
veal data necessary to defend oneself.
It does not matter whether the revela 
tion involves a confidence (testimonial 
type information received from the cli 
ent) or a secret (non-testimonial obser 
vations made by the attorney of the cli 
ent). In either case, the attorney may
reveal such to defend herself or protect
another party from violence. But, out 
side of these exceptions, neither confi 
dences nor secrets are permitted to be
revealed.

EmiJ PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTY

33. C is the correct answer. Although an
attorney is permitted to represent mul 
tiple clients in one cause of action, if a
conflict develops between any of the
clients, the attorney must withdraw
from all. MR 1.7(b); DR 5-105(C.) A,
Band D are incorrect for the same rea 
son that C is correct.

34. C is the correct answer. Since the par 
ties, the court, and the time-frame are
all different there is no real conflict of
interest in taking an opposite legal po 
sition some time in the future. See MR
1.7, Comment [9]. A and B are incor 
rect for the same reasons that C is cor 
rect. D is incorrect because it is irrel 
evant whether or not the case was
de-published. The issue is whether the
attorney misbehaved - not whether the
case has precedential weight.

35. D is correct because only choices II, III,
IV and V are correct. II is correct be 
cause business transactions between
lawyers and their clients are not pro 
hibited completely. MR 1.8(a); DR
5-104(A.) III is correct because, under
MR 1.8(a)(3) written client consent is
required, but there is no such require 
ment in the Model Code of Professional
Responsibility. Therefore, the correct
answer for the MPRE uses discretion 
ary language, such as the word
"should." IV is correct because telling
the client that he need not do business
with the lawyer insures that the client's
participation is voluntary and that there
is no attorney over-reaching. MR
1.8(a)(l); DR 5-104(A); EC 5-3. V is
correct for the same reasons that IV is
correct.

36. D is the correct answer. Under MR
1.8(h), a lawyer is permitted to prospec 
tively limit his malpractice liability only
if the client receives independent legal
advice recommending such. There was
none here. (Under DR 6-102(A), such
a waiver is, per se, banned.) Thus, D is
correct. A is incorrect because attorneys
are permitted to lower prices so as to
compete with their peers. Band C are
incorrect because no facts indicate that
Delta paid the magazine reporter to stir
up business for him.

PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBIUTY Em

40. A is the correct answer. A vicariously
disqualified attorney (here Smith) is no
longer disqualified if he discontinues
association with the actually disquali 
fied attorney. See generally MR 1.10;
DR 5-105(D). Band C are correct an 
swers, but they are less specific and,
thus, less preferable to choice A. D is
incorrect for the same reason that A is
correct.

41. B is the correct answer. Actual or im 
puted disqualification can be waived by
the opposing party. Thus, since such
occurred here, B is the correct answer.
MR 1.lO(d). A is incorrect because in
no way does it appear that Kingsley's
lawyers compromised his case - Gloria
had to be screened off the case. C is in 
correct because whether or not Smith
and Jones take the case, Gloria has per 
formed up to the standards by making
the conflict known and apparently tak 
ing no part in the case. D is incorrect
since no facts whatsoever suggest that
Gloria will compromise Kingsley's po 
sition.

37. D is the correct answer. An attorney is
not permitted to receive as his fee rights
to a book about the subject matter of
the litigation. MR 1.8(d); DR 5-104(B).
Thus, A, Band C are incorrect; and D
is the best answer. (Note: California law
may permit such an arrangement.)

38. A is the correct answer. When a lawyer
has learned something confidential and
relevant about a client, she is not per 
mitted to oppose that client in a later
case. MR 1.9(a); EC 4-6. B is incorrect
because it misreads the facts. The facts
indicate that the prior confidence is
"somewhat related," thus, the best an 
swer is that Gloria cannot take the case.
C is incorrect because screening Gloria
off the case is not an available option
under the facts. D is incorrect for the
same reason that A is correct.

39. C is correct because choices I, II and II
are correct. When a lawyer in a firm is
disqualified, generally all lawyers in the
firm are disqualified. MR 1.10; DR
5-105(D). Although terminating Gloria
is harsh and may open Smith and Jones
to civil liability for wrongful termina 
tion; the termination will remove the
conflict of interest. Screening Gloria off
the case is acceptable, provided there
is written consent.

B PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBlurY

45. C is the correct answer. Angel is in a
difficult position. Not only should he
counsel Jim and Rockford Corp., but
he also may have some duties to Dodd
- who apparently is seeking Angel's
legal advice. Since what Dodd says may
hurt Dodd if revealed - but may possi 
bly aid Rockford Corp., Angel should
as soon as possible tell Dodd that he
represents Rockford not Dodd. Other 
wise, there might arise an impermissible
conflict of interest between the duties
owed to Rockford and those owed to
Dodd. Without this kind of warning,
Dodd's interests might severely be com 
promised. See MR 1.13, Comment [8].
Although withdrawing would be per 
missible, Dodd's interests are more im 
minent and, thus, important, thus, C is
a better answer than A. Similarly, al 
though counseling against future fraud
is important, Dodd should be told by
Angel that Angel is not his attorney  
and, thus, their conversation is not privi 
leged. Therefore, again, C is a better
answer than B. For similar reasons of
imminence and the immediacy of
Dodd's problems, C is a better answer
than D.

42. C is the correct answer. MR 1.11(a)
permits the new firm not to be disquali 
fied if the former government attorney
is screened off the case and the oppos 
ing party is given notice. This rule al 
lows government attorneys mobility
and is probably a necessity due to the
large volume of cases that government
attorneys deal with. A and B are incor 
rect because they avoid discussing the
particulars of the rule which governs
this situation. D is an incorrect answer
because, although it correctly states the
policy behind the rule, it does not state
the rule itself. As always, a more spe 
cific answer is to be chosen over a cor 
rect but more general answer.

43. C is the correct answer. When a lawyer
works for a business entity and a direc 
tor of that entity indicates the desire to
perform an act involving fraud, the first
thing the attorney should do is ask this
individual to reconsider and seek a sec 
ond opinion from another attorney. See
MR 1.13(b); EC 5-18; EC 5-24; DR
5-107(B). Thus, C is correct. Since
withdrawal at this point is not required,
both A and B are incorrect. D is incor 
rect because a breach of the confidence
is not acceptable.

44. A is the correct answer. Going over the
head of the individual in the business
entity who intends to do the fraud is the
correct course of conduct. Thus, A is
correct. MR 1.13(b). B, C and D are in 
correct for the same reason that A is
correct.

PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBIUTY â€¢

46. C is the correct answer. Although this
attorney is in good faith and has made
a legitimate economic decision; never 
theless the code is quite unforgiving. It
is required that the trust account be in
the state in which the attorney practices
law. MR 1.15; DR 9-102(A). A is in 
correct because the conduct is not
fraudulent. B is incorrect for the same
reason that C is correct. Although the
attorney's choice may be economically
intelligent, it is legally stupid to overtly
violate the code. [Please note: the stu 
dent may have noted an inordinate num 
ber of C choices as the correct answer.
This was purposeful, on the part of the
drafter. Students should not be attempt 
ing to "fudge" answers such that there
are 25 % of each choice.]

47. C is the correct answer. Although re 
ceiving property as advance payment
of fees from a client is not preferred, it
is acceptable if such is kept separate
from the property of the attorney. Put 
ting the property in a client-only safety
deposit box is the ideal method. See MR
1.15, Comment [1]; DR 9-102(B)(2). A
is incorrect for the same reason that C
is correct. B is incorrect because a prob 
lem will arise if less money is earned
than the value of the watch. D is cor 
rect, but C is a more specific, thus, bet 
ter answer.

48. B is the correct answer. The Model
Rules recommend the procedure of 
fered in choice B. See MR U5(c) and
Comment [3]. A is incorrect because it
entirely disregards the client's wishes
which may have a reasonable basis. B
is incorrect, since by paying the client,
the attorney may be furthering a fraud.
D is incorrect only because the attor 
ney has no claim to the funds and, thus,
is not a necessary party to the arbitra 
tion.

49. D is the correct answer. A is incorrect
because it is in dispute that $150,000 is
owed to client. Such must be paid. Only
$40,000 is in dispute. Band C are in 
correct because it is not a defense to
taking disputed funds out of the trust
account that the client is acting irratio 
nally.

50. A is the correct answer. That the client
is not injured is irrelevant to the rule
prohibiting commingling. Since taking
Client's funds was without consent, it
is commingling. B is incorrect because
lawyers are permitted to gamble with
their own money, outside of their prac 
tice of law. C and D are incorrect for
the same reasons that A is correct.

IDB PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBlurY

53. D is the correct answer. Attorneys must
not either harass an opposing party or
pursue a frivolous argument. MR 3.1;
DR 7-102(A)(l). Since it is stipulated
that Vardon merely desired to "wear
down" the opposing party, such action
is definitely prohibited, and, thus, only
D is the correct answer. A, Band Care
incorrect for the very same reason that
D is correct.

54. A is the correct answer. Prosecutors
have a higher duty of "justice" than
other attorneys - not only must they
obey the applicable code of legal eth 
ics and do a good job but they also must
personally and reasonably believe that
she who the prosecutor is prosecuting
is more likely than not guilty. Prosecu 
tors do not have the luxury of simply
trying "pretty good" cases. MR 3.1; See
generally 7-102. Thus, A is correct, and
B, C and D are incorrect.

51. B is the correct answer. There was cer 
tainly commingling and this is certainly
prohibited. Since harm to the client is
irrelevant when there is commingling,
A is a poor choice. C is incorrect be 
cause there is no good faith exception
to the rule prohibiting commingling.
However, in passing, it is noted that the
state disciplinary board may consider
the good faith when doling out the pun 
ishment. D is incorrect because illness
on the part of the attorney may be a
mitigating factor. See generally MR
1.15, DR 9-102. [Please note: the call
of this question was phrased in the nega 
tive.]

52. B is the correct answer. Because the
attorney-client relationship is fiduciary
in nature and because it is the client who
is in the position of trust, clients are
generally permitted to terminate the
services of their attorneys "at will" with
little or no penalty. MR 1.16(a)(3); DR
2-110(B)(4). Attorneys, when termi 
nated, as a general rule, must withdraw;
thus, B is the correct answer. A and C
are incorrect for the same reasons that
B is correct. D is incorrect because there
is no need for arbitration as to whether
the attorney must withdraw after being
fired by the client - the lawyer shall
withdraw.

PROFESSIONALRESPONSIBIUTY B

55. B is the correct answer because only
choices I and II are correct. I is correct
because attorneys are generally not dis 
ciplined for simply losing cases. There
must be another factor, such as neglect.
II is correct because attorneys need not
reveal cases on point which are outside
the jurisdiction. However, attorneys
must reveal cases within the jurisdic 
tion which are directly on point; thus,
III is incorrect. MR 3.3(a)(3); DR
7-106(B)(1). (Note: there is no such
requirement to reveal contra cases in
California.) IV is incorrect because at 
torneys must not purposely mislead the
jury in closing argument. MR 3.3(a)(1);
DR 7- 102(A)(5). (Note: the call of this
question is phrased in the negative.)

56. A is the correct answer. An attorney
must not help a client commit perjury.
MR 3.3(a)(4); DR 7-102(A)(4). Since
Shannon did this, she is subject to dis 
cipline. In order for an attorney to be
civilly liable for malpractice, there must
occur two elements: 1) an attorney er 
ror (usually shown by referring to the
state's code of ethics) and 2) harm/dam 
ages to the client. Since Winston was
acquitted, prong 2 is lacking and there
is no malpractice liability. Only choice
A includes the above two propositions
(discipline but no malpractice.) Thus,
B, C and D are incorrect.

57. D is the correct answer because only
choices III, IV and V are correct. An
attorney must counsel his client to fur 
nish to the opposing party all material
evidence. MR 3.4(a); DR 7-109(A.)
Since the document is certainly mate 
rial evidence, O'Mallory must advise
his client to make such available. I and
II are, thus, incorrect and III and IV are,
thus, correct. V is correct because in the
event that the client refuses to tum over
material evidence the attorney cannot
blow the whistle. Moreover, attorneys
are permitted to tell clients the
attorney's ethical duties.

58. A is the correct answer. Attorneys en 
joy a real degree of First Amendment
free speech protection; thus, they are
permitted to speak to the press pre-trial.
Attorneys can be disciplined only if
they intend or should have known that
their comments will prejudice the trial.
Since Flash's conduct fell short ofthat,
it was proper. B, C and D are incorrect
for the same reasons that A is correct.
See generally MR 3.6(a); DR 7-107.

59. A is the correct answer. A lawyer is per 
mitted to testify as to the value of her
legal services, thus, A is the correct an 
swer. MR 3.7(a)(2); DR 5-lOl(B)(3).
B, C and D are incorrect for the same
reason that A is correct.

mJ PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBIUTY

60. D is the correct answer. A lawyer must
not communicate with a represented
party absent the opposing lawyer's con 
sent or judicial order. MR 4.2. There
was no order here. Thus A, Band Care
incorrect.

61. A is the correct answer. It is no defense
to a charge of discipline that the charged
lawyer was simply obeying the orders
of his superior. MR 5.2(a). It is a disci 
plinary violation to intentionally mis 
lead the opposing party. MR 4.1; DR
7-102. Thus, A is correct and B is in 
correct. C and D are incorrect because
more facts are needed as to whether
there is tort liability, e.g., were there
damages?

62. C is the correct answer because both
choices I and II are correct. A lawyer is
responsible when he directs another
lawyer to violate the rules of ethics.
Thus, I is correct. Similarly, a lawyer
must supervise underling employees.
Thus, II is correct. See generally MR
5.1.

63. A is the correct answer. Until a lawyer
has been sworn in, he is not licensed to
practice law. Since Bob was not sworn
in, did not receive a waiver from he
court, was not practicing with a licensed
attorney of record and was within no
other exception - he was practicing law
without a license. B is incorrect because
he did not have a law license - he was
waiting. C is incorrect because profit 
motive is not the test for the unautho 
rized practice of law. D is incorrect be 
cause a lawyer need not be in court to
be practicing without a license. MR 5.5;
DR 3-101(B).

64. D is the correct answer. A lawyer must
not restrict the rights of other lawyers
to practice law, when they are no longer
in the same firm. MR 5.6(a); DR 2-108.
A is incorrect because such arrange 
ments are per se unreasonable. B is in 
correct because the facts are explicit  
there was such a requirement. C is in 
correct because both codes are in com 
plete agreement.

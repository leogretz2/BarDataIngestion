36. Assume for the purposes of this question that
Purcher is a merchant under the UCC by
virtue of his "knowledge" and "skill" in deal-
ing with goods of this kind. If Purcher persists
in his position that his order was effectively
withdrawn, can Celanese sue him successfully
for breach of contract?

(A) No, because Celanese could effectively
accept Purcher's offer only by the act of
shipping a month's installment of the
hydraulic fluid.

(B) No, because there was no consideration
to make Purcher's offer irrevocable.

(C) Yes, because Purcher's revocation was

ineffective since the purchase order
expressly stated that it was non-can-
cellable.

(D) Yes, because Purcher's order was an

irrevocable order that became a contract
when Celanese accepted it.

37. Assume for the purposes of this question only
that on March 20 a valid contract was entered
into between Purcher and Celanese. In accor-
dance with the terms of their agreement,
Celanese promised "to supply Purcher with
his requirements of Lindol HF-M hydraulic
fluid in monthly shipments for one year com-
mencing on April 1." Purcher in turn
promised to pay Celanese the stipulated price
of $4.25 per gallon. Celanese knew that
Purcher's average daily requirements were 40
gallons, but their contract contained no recital
or estimate thereof. In April, Celanese sup-
plied Purcher with 1,200 gallons of hydraulic
fluid for which Purcher paid $5,100. The next
month Celanese delivered 1,150 gallons
which Purcher paid for at the contract price.
In June, however, a new hydraulic die casting
plant started operating in the neighboring
town of Golden, and Purcher's business began
to decline at once. By August, Purcher's need
for hydraulic fluid had dropped to less than 10
gallons per day. At this time, which of the fol-
lowing best states the legal rights and duties
of the parties under the terms of their agree-
ment?

Regardless of what he decides to do,
Purcher is not liable to Celanese because
the wording of their agreement is too
indefinite to be enforced as a contract.
Due to the unexpected downturn in his
business operations, Purcher can avoid
any further contractual liability by
immediately closing down his hydraulic
die casting plant.
Purcher remains obligated to accept and
pay for his actual monthly requirements
of hydraulic fluid so long as they are not
unreasonably disproportionate to
Purcher's prior requirements.

(D) Purcher remains obligated to accept and

pay for an average of 1,200 gallons of
hydraulic fluid per month for the
remainder of the year because Celanese
promised to supply Purcher's require-
ments on that anticipated basis.

Questions 38-39 are based on the following fact situation.

On April 1, Nu Skin Inc., a wholesale skin care dis-
tributor, wrote the following letter to the La Costa
Spa and Beauty Center:

"Please be advised that we have been granted
an exclusive distributorship for Christiaan
Barnard's GLYCEL Cellular Facial Cleanser.
We hereby offer you at $250 per case (25 bot-
tles per case) for such quantities as you may
need during the balance of this calendar
year."

On April 15, La Costa replied by letter:

"We are thrilled to hear that you will be dis-
tributing Christiaan Barnard's GLYCEL
Facial Cleanser. Our guests and customers
request it more than any other product. We
certainly accept your offer, and expect to use
GLYCEL exclusively to meet all our facial
cleanser requirements the rest of this year."

Thereafter, La Costa ordered and used large quanti-
ties of GLYCEL at its Spa and Beauty Center facil-
ities. Many of its guests and customers even
purchased individual bottles of GLYCEL which La
Costa sold at a retail price of $25 per bottle.
However, on September 30, Nu Skin Inc. sent La
Costa the following letter:

"Sorry to inform you but there has been an
unexpected price increase in the GLYCEL
Cellular Facial Cleanser product. The manu-
facturer has just notified us that the cost of
producing byogenic cellulites, the main
ingredient of GLYCEL, has risen substan-
tially in the last few months necessitating a
price increase from $250 to $300 per case for
the remainder of the year."

After receiving this letter, La Costa concluded that
$300 per case was excessive and then began order-
ing Geraldine Ferraro's Nutra Skin Facial Cleanser
â€” a popular brand, but less favored and less con-
sumed by La Costa guests and customers from
another wholesaler at $250 per case. Immediately
thereafter, La Costa sued Nu Skin Inc. in a breach
of contract action for money damages.

38. Which of the following is the best legal argu-

ment in support of La Costa's suit?

(A) Nu Skin Inc.'s letter of April 1 was an

offer that became irrevocable because of
La Costa's bargained-for reliance
thereon in ordering and accepting Nu
Skin Inc.'s shipments of GLYCEL from
April through September.

(B) Nu Skin Inc.'s letter of April 1 was a
firm offer of an output contract from
one merchant to another that La Costa
accepted on April 15.

(C) The parties' April 1-15 correspondence

constituted a bilateral contract under
which Nu Skin Inc. agreed to sell and
La Costa agreed to purchase enough
GLYCEL at $250 per case to meet all of
La Costa's requirements for the rest of
the year.

(D) La Costa's first order of GLYCEL in
April was an acceptance of Nu Skin
Inc.'s offer of April 1 for a series of uni-
lateral contracts, and thereby terminated
Nu Skin Inc.'s power of revocation.

39. Assume for the purposes of this question

only that Nu Skin Inc.'s September 30 letter
of a price increase to $300 per case was a
repudiation and total breach of a require-
ments contract. To which of the following
would La Costa be entitled in its action
against Nu Skin Inc.?

I.

The net profits La Costa would have
made from the resale of GLYCEL to its
guests and customers at $25 per bottle
had it been able to purchase the facial
cleanser at $250 per case during the
remainder of the year, less the net prof-
its it made from sales of Geraldine
Ferraro's product during the same
period.

II. Nominal damages only.
III. $50 multiplied by the number of cases
of GLYCEL La Costa would have pur-
chased from September 30 through
December 31.

Questions 40-41 are based on the following fact situation.

Calvin Cline was a wealthy industrialist who lived
in Nashville. Calvin was extremely proud of his
daughter, Patsy, who graduated from Vanderbilt
Law School and had just passed the Tennessee bar
examination. As a graduation gift, Calvin leased an
office suite for Patsy in The Opray Building, an old
prestigious edifice in downtown Nashville. Calvin
promised Patsy that he would pay the monthly rental
and also renovate and decorate the office for her.

Thereupon, Calvin went ahead and contracted in
writing with Ace Building Co. to renovate Patsy's
new law office according to plans and specifica-
tions prepared by Office Interiors, a famous
Nashville architectural firm. According to the con-
tract with Ace, Calvin agreed to pay Ace $15,000 to
perform the renovation work. The agreement recited
that Calvin was hiring Ace to remodel the office as
a graduation gift to Patsy. Relying on her father's
contract with Ace, Patsy, who had an option to
lease another office in a different building, allowed
the option to expire and so advised Calvin and Ace.

After beginning the renovation work, Ace discov-
ered there was asbestos insulation throughout the
walls and ceilings. As a result, Ace notified Calvin
that in order to renovate the office according to the
plans and specifications provided by Office
Interiors, the asbestos would have to be removed at
an additional cost of $25,000. Neither Calvin nor
Ace had reason to anticipate that the asbestos con-
dition would prevent Ace from performing the
remodeling work as per Office Interiors' specifica-
tions.

40. Assume for the purposes of this question only

that Calvin refuses to pay Ace the additional
$25,000 to remove the asbestos. Thereafter,
Ace notifies Calvin that it will not perform
the remodeling work according to the plans
and specifications as provided. As a result,
which of the following facts, if conceded or
provable, would be most persuasive in sup-
porting an action by Calvin against Ace for
breach of contract?

Prior to entering into the contract with
Ace, Calvin made no representations to
Ace concerning the asbestos insulation
in the office.
At the time Calvin and Ace entered into
their contract, neither party knew that
the office was insulated with asbestos.
Patsy had relied on Ace's promise to
remodel the office by canceling her
option to lease another office.
Ace had agreed to perform the remodel-
ing work as per the plans and specifica-
tions provided by Office Interiors, and it
was physically possible for them to ren-
ovate the office according to those plans
and specifications.

41. Assume for the purposes of this question only

that Ace would not have been excused from
performing the remodeling work according to
the original plans and specifications as pro-
vided by Office Interiors. Upon discovery of
the asbestos, however, Calvin and Ace agreed
to radically alter the renovation work so that
the asbestos did not have to be removed.
Thereafter, Patsy did not learn of the changes
until after Ace completed the remodeling. If
Patsy finds the changes to be unacceptable,
will she succeed in an action against Ace for
not renovating the office according to the
original plans and specifications?

No, because Patsy was only an inciden-
tal beneficiary under the terms of
Calvin's contract with Ace.
No, because Patsy's rights under
Calvin's contract with Ace were subject
to any defenses that Ace could have
raised against Calvin.
Yes, because Calvin and Ace's modifica-
tion of their original contract was invalid
since it was not supported by any new
consideration.
Yes, because Patsy had changed her
position in reliance on the original con-
tract that was entered into between
Calvin and Ace.

CONTRACTS

43. For this question only, assume the following

facts. Soon after making its contract with
Bouquet, Vintage, without Bouquet's knowl-
edge or assent, sold its vineyards but not its
winery to Agribiz, a large agricultural corpo-
ration. Under the terms of this sale, Agribiz
agreed to sell to Vintage all grapes grown on
the land for five years. Agribiz's employees
have no experience in wine-grape production,
and Agribiz has no reputation in the wine
industry as a grape producer or otherwise.
The Bouquet-Vintage contract was silent on
the matter of Vintage selling any or all of its
business assets.

If Bouquet seeks an appropriate judicial rem-
edy against Vintage for entering into the
Vintage-Agribiz transaction, is Bouquet likely
to prevail?

(A) Yes, because the Vintage-Agribiz trans-
action created a significant risk of
diminishing the profits in which
Bouquet would share under his contract
with Vintage.

(B) Yes, because the Bouquet-Vintage con-
tract did not contain a provision autho-
rizing a delegation of Vintage's duties.
(C) No, because Vintage remains in a posi-
tion to perform under the Bouquet-
Vintage contract.

(D) No, because Vintage, as a corporation,
must necessarily perform its contracts
by delegating duties to individuals.

Questions 42 -43 are based on the following fact situation.

A written contract was entered into between
Bouquet, a financier-investor, and Vintage
Corporation, a winery and grape-grower. The con-
tract provided that Bouquet would invest
$1,000,000 in Vintage for its capital expansion and,
in return, that Vintage, from grapes grown in its
famous vineyards, would produce and market at
least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five
years under the label "Premium Vintage-Bouquet."

The contract included provisions that the parties
would share equally the profits and losses from the
venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be dis-
tributed by Vintage only through Claret, a whole-
sale distributor of fine wines. Neither Bouquet nor
Vintage had previously dealt with Claret. Claret
learned of the contract two days later from reading
a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immedi-
ately hired an additional sales executive and con-
tracted for enlargement of his wine storage and
display facility.

42. If Vintage refuses to distribute the wine

through Claret and Claret then sues Vintage
for breach of contract, is it likely that Claret
will prevail?

(A)

(B)

Yes, because Vintage's performance was
to run to Claret rather than to Bouquet.
Yes, because Bouquet and Vintage could
reasonably foresee that Claret would
change his position in reliance on the
contract.
No, because Bouquet and Vintage did
not expressly agree that Claret would
have enforceable rights under their
contract.
No, because Bouquet and Vintage, hav-
ing no apparent motive to benefit Claret,
appeared in making the contract to have
been protecting or serving only their
own interests.

Question 44 is based on the following fact situation.

Questions 45-46 are based on the following fact situation.

After preliminary negotiations, Timberland Comp.,
a lumber manufacturer, and Redwood Fence Comp.
entered into the following written agreement on
May 1, 2006:

"Timberland promises to sell and Redwood
promises to buy 5,000 sections of redwood
stockade fence at $10 per section. Each sec-
tion is to be made of good quality split red-
wood poles and is to be 7 feet in length and 3
feet in height. Delivery to be made on June 1,
2006 with payment no later than thirty days
thereafter."

As per the terms of their contract, Timberland
delivered 5,000 sections of redwood to Redwood's
warehouse facility in Baltimore on June 1st. The
next day Redwood's president, John Woodstock,
inspected the shipment and discovered the pole
sections were all 5 feet long and 2 feet high.
Woodstock then told his warehouse manager that
the poles were non-conforming and to set them
aside until "the problem could be corrected."
Woodstock forgot about the matter until July 1st
when Timberland sent a letter to Redwood
demanding payment. Woodstock failed to respond
to Timberland's letter. There was no further commu-
nication between Timberland and Redwood until
August 1st when Timberland sent another letter to
Redwood demanding payment and threatening legal
action if necessary. Again, Woodstock did not
respond to Timberland's letter; and on September
1st Timberland brought suit against Redwood for
$50,000 or the contract price equivalent.

44. Which of the following correctly states

Redwood's legal rights or liabilities as of
September 1st?

(A) Redwood can return the fence sections
to Timberland and rescind the contract.
(B) Redwood must pay Timberland the rea-
sonable value of the fence sections.
(C) Redwood can require Timberland to

replace the non-conforming tender
with fence sections meeting contract
specifications.

(D) Redwood lost any remedy it may have

had because it failed to notify
Timberland within a reasonable time
that the delivery was non-conforming.

Sparticus, a dealer in antique Italian art, owned a
collection of five hand-crafted vases recovered
from the ruins of Pompeii. The vases were
extremely rare and were made during the first
century A.D. Guggenheim, an antique art collector,
contracted to buy the five vases from Sparticus for
$10,000 each.

Sparticus then shipped the vases to Guggenheim.
During transit one of the vases broke. When
Guggenheim received the shipment, he opened the
package and saw the broken vase. As a result,
Guggenheim contacted Sparticus to inform him
that he would not perform the contract and would
not accept any of the vases.

45. If Sparticus asserts a breach of contract action

against Guggenheim, judgment for

(A) Guggenheim, if the contract provided
that delivery was to be made F.O.B. at
seller's place of business
(B) Guggenheim, because it was a
non-conforming tender

(C) Sparticus, because the contract is

divisible in nature

(D) Sparticus, because he has substantially
performed his side of the bargain

46. Assume for the purposes of this question only

that Guggenheim decides to pay for the four
undamaged vases. In determining the proper
contract price, he will be required to pay

(A) $40,000

Question 47 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 48 is based on the following fact situation.

Zeller contracted in writing to deliver to Baker 100
bushels of wheat on August 1 at $3.50 a bushel.
Because his suppliers had not delivered enough
wheat to him by that time, Zeller on August 1 had
only 95 bushels of wheat with which to fulfill his
contract with Baker.

48. If Zeller tenders 95 bushels of wheat to Baker

on August 1, and Baker refused to accept or
pay for any of the wheat, which of the follow-
ing best states the legal relationship between
Zeller and Baker?

Zeller has a cause of action against
Baker, because Zeller has substantially
performed his contract.
Zeller is excused from performing his
contract because of impossibility of
performance.
Baker has a cause of action against
Zeller for Zeller's failure to deliver 100
bushels of wheat.
Baker is obligated to give Zeller a rea-
sonable time to attempt to obtain the
other five bushels of wheat.

On December 15, Harrison Freeman went to Circuit
City to purchase a television. While browsing
around the store, Harrison saw a 30-inch Zenith
console model #867 that he particularly liked. The
advertised list price for the television set was $500.
Sensing a potential sale, Midge Megdel, a store
clerk, approached Harrison and asked if she could
be of any assistance. Harrison indicated that he
wanted to buy the television but he wouldn't have
enough cash until the following Thursday when he
got paid. Midge advised Harrison to sign a standard
contract for the purchase of the Zenith television so
that he could buy it at the $500 list price since a
price increase would be taking effect after January
1st. Heeding Midge's advice, Harrison signed a
standard contract with Circuit City promising to
buy the television on or before December 30 for the
purchase price of $500.

Circuit City had purchased 10 Zenith model #867
television sets from its distributor at a cost of $300
per television. As such, Circuit City stood to make
a $200 profit on the sale of each Zenith model
#867 television set which it sold.

On December 20, Harrison saw the same television
set being sold by Radio Shack for $395. As a result,
Harrison breached his contract with Circuit City
and purchased the same Zenith television at Radio
Shack, saving himself $105. On December 21
Quincy Quillen entered the Circuit City store and
bought the same Zenith television that Harrison
had contracted to purchase from Midge for the
price of $500.

Despite the fact that Circuit City did not lose any
money as a result of Harrison's breach, nonetheless
they have decided to sue him. Circuit City can also
show that it is able to obtain as many television sets
as it can sell.

47. In an action for breach of contract against

Harrison, Circuit City will most likely recover
the following amount of damages:

(A) nothing
$200
(B)
(C)
$300
(D) $500

Questions 49-50 are based on the following fact situation.

49. Which of the following best characterizes

Gelson was the owner of Gelson's Market, the
largest supermarket in the town of Suburb. On
September 10, Gelson sent the following telegram
to Concita, who was the owner of a banana planta-
tion in Panama:

"Subject to your prompt acceptance, ship at
once 200 bushels of your Conquita bananas
to our supermarket. Thereafter, deliver 100
bushels of bananas by the first day of each of
the following three months. Will pay current
market price for all shipments.

s/Galvin Gelson"

This purchase order was received by Concita on
September 11. The next day, he shipped 199
bushels of bananas to Gelson which were received
and accepted on September 19. At the time Gelson
accepted this shipment, he realized that it contained
199 bushels of bananas not the 200 as ordered.
Nonetheless, Gelson promptly paid for the first
shipment as billed. Concita's second shipment of
bananas was received by Gelson on September 30.
This shipment, which contained the full 100
bushels, was accepted and paid for by Gelson.
On October 10, however, Concita wired Gelson
notifying him that no further banana shipments
would be made.

Concita's shipment and Gelson's acceptance
of the first 199 bushels of bananas?

The shipment was an acceptance of
Gelson's offer, and, by accepting the
non-conforming tender, with or without
timely objection, Gelson waived what-
ever rights he may have had against
Concita.
The shipment was an acceptance of
Gelson's offer, and, notwithstanding
Gelson's acceptance of the bananas,
also a breach of an implied promise
by Concita to deliver according to
specifications.
The shipment was a counteroffer, and
Gelson accepted it by paying for the
bananas with knowledge of the shortage.
The shipment was made for purposes of
accommodation only, and, thus Concita
was entitled to cure the non-conforming
tender within a reasonable period of
time.

Instead of accepting Concita's first shipment,
Gelson rightfully might have

refused to accept the shipment unless
Concita assured him that the quantity
deficiency (i.e., one bushel) would be
shipped within a reasonable time
rejected the whole shipment, with an
indication of his readiness and willing-
ness to accept future conforming ship-
ments
rejected the whole shipment, with notice
to Concita that no future shipments,
conforming or otherwise, would be
accepted
rejected part of the shipment and
accepted part of the shipment on the rea-
sonable assumption that the non-confor-
mity would be seasonably cured

Question 1 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 2 is based on the following fact situation.

The state of New Mexico has enacted a criminal
law statute making it unlawful to knowingly pos-
sess, sell or transport narcotics and other controlled
dangerous substances. Scott Scagg was a reputed
drug dealer who lived in Bisbee, Arizona.
Oftentimes Scott would hire drivers to transport
drugs across the southwest.

One day Scott approached Pat Pappas, an acquain-
tance, and offered to pay him $500 to drive a van
from Bisbee to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Pat,
who was unemployed and needed the money,
agreed. Scott then explained to Pat that he would be
transporting a package to a person named Milo
Meeker. Scott placed the package in the glove com-
partment of the van. Pat never asked nor was told
what was contained in the package. The package
contained a kilo of cocaine.

During the 10 hour drive from Bisbee to
Albuquerque, Pat deliberately refrained from look-
ing into the glove compartment and inspecting the
package. When Pat arrived at Milo's residence in
Albuquerque, he was greeted by Milo who removed
the package from the glove compartment. Moments
later, police arrived at the scene and arrested both
Pat and Milo.

2.	

If Pat is charged with violating the aforemen-
tioned New Mexico criminal law statute, he
should be found

(A) guilty because he illegally transported

(B)

the narcotics
guilty, if he should have known that nar-
cotics were contained in the package

( ,) not guilty, unless he had actual knowl-
' edge that the package contained nar-

cotics

(D) not guilty, unless a reasonable person
should have inspected the package to
ascertain what it contained

The Anglo-American criminal law is founded upon
certain basic premises which have been more or
less strictly observed by courts and legislatures
when formulating the substantive law of crimes.
These basic premises concern the requirements of
(1) act, (2) mental state, (3) concurrence, (4) harm,
(5) causation, (6) punishment, and (7) legality. The
first of these basic premises concerns the require-
ment of an act. As a general rule, it is commonly
said that conduct, to be criminal, must consist of
something more than a mere "bad state of mind."

1.	 With regard to the requirement of an act, in

which of the following cases would the defen-
dant, if charged with criminal homicide, most
likely be acquitted because there was no act?

Aaron was a chronic sleepwalker. On
Monday, Aaron got into a violent argu-
ment with his next-door neighbor,
Sidney. The next night, while he was
asleep, Aaron left his home and walked
to Sidney's house. He entered the front
door which was unlocked and ascended
the stairs to Sidney's bedroom. While
still sleepwalking, Aaron went inside
and strangled Sidney to death.
(B) Bernie suffered from an incurable

malignant brain tumor. One night he
stabbed his roommate, Reggie, to death.
Bernie later stated that he could remem-
ber the occurrence clearly. A physician
testified that Bernie's brain tumor could
at times deprive him of his ability to
control his movements.

(C) Cassandra was an epileptic who had

experienced seizures in the past. As she
was driving to work one morning, she
had an epileptic seizure. As a result, she
lost control of her vehicle which went
through a red light and struck a group of
school children who were crossing the
street. Two young girls were killed in the
accident.

(D) Dozer, a drug addict, injected himself
with a speedball, containing a mixture
of heroin and cocaine. A few seconds
later, Dozer began to hallucinate.
Believing that he was a rabid dog, Dozer
attacked his girlfriend, Giselle, and bit
off her nose and ears. Giselle died from
her wounds.

Question 4 is based on the following fact situation.

Pickney was wearing a grey London Fog raincoat
when he entered Tony Roma's Restaurant for din-

the foyer of the restaurant. After his meal, Pickney
picked up a similar grey raincoat believing it to be
his own. The raincoat which he took, however,
belonged to Floyd, another patron. Pickney left the
restaurant and walked a short distance when he
realized that he had taken the wrong raincoat by
mistake. He then returned to Tony Roma's and
placed Floyd's raincoat back on the coat rack. He
found his raincoat which had been partially hidden
under a stack of other coats.

4.	

If Pickney were arrested and charged with lar-
ceny of Floyd's raincoat, he will most likely
be acquitted because

there was a mistake of fact

(A)
(B) he returned the raincoat after discover-

ing his mistake

(CD he lacked the requisite state of mind
(D) there was no fraudulent conversion

3.	

In which of the following situations could a
court applying the common law doctrine most
likely convict Defendant of the crime charged
despite the Defendant's mistake?

(A) Defendant was charged with assault with
intent to commit rape. He admittedly
ripped off Amelda's panties after mistak-
enly believing that she had consented to
engage in sexual intercourse with him.

(B) Defendant was charged with murder. He
shot and killed Boris after a barroom
argument. Defendant mistakenly thought
that Boris had raised his hand to shoot
him when, in fact, the victim was shak-
ing his fist at Defendant to frighten him.

(C) Defendant was charged with burglary.

She broke into her old boyfriend's home
and took a Gorman painting which she
erroneously believed he had given her
before their relationship ended.
cr2) Defendant was charged with bigamy.
She married Derek five years after her
husband, Domino, was reported missing
after a boating accident. Thereafter,
Domino, who had been rescued,
returned alive. A state statute provides
that a person is presumed dead after six
years of unexplained absence. Defendant
mistakenly believed that the statutory
period was four years.

passionately embracing her. Despondent by her
boyfriend's public display of infidelity, Inca aim-
lessly began wandering around the vicinity of the
park. As she passed by the Blarney Stone Tavern,
Inca decided to go in and have a drink.

After guzzling down a couple of beers, she started
conversing with Raven, a customer seated next to
her. The two women began commiserating about
their relationships with unfaithful boyfriends. While
they talked, Inca and Raven continued to drink beer
with an occasional shot of Jose Cuervo tequila.
They soon became intoxicated. As they discussed
ways to get back at Eli, Raven suggested that they
set fire to his home. With Inca in agreement, the
two women staggered from the bar and went to Eli's
home.

Under the cover of night, Inca and Raven picked up
little twigs and tree branches and stacked them
along the outside of Eli's home. Inca then lit them
with her cigarette lighter. As the branches ignited in
flames, Inca and Raven hurriedly ran away. Seeing
smoke from his bedroom window, Eli ran outside
and immediately extinguished the fire with a gar-
den hose. The fire slightly charred a small section
of the exterior of Eli's home but did not cause any
significant damage.

If Inca is prosecuted for common law arson,
she should be found

(A) guilty, unless her intoxication negated

(B)

her criminal intent
guilty, because voluntary intoxication is
no defense since she knew she was set-
ting fire to the dwelling house of

Question 7 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 8 is based on the following fact situation.

This jurisdiction follows the M'Naghten test for
insanity.

7.	

In which of the following situations would
Defendant be found not guilty by reason of
insanity under the M'Naghten rule?

I.

Defendant is paranoid and thinks
Victim's shadow is following him every-
where he goes. Defendant shoots at the
"shadow" and kills Victim.

II. Defendant suffers from schizophrenia.

He has a delusion that victim is trying to
kill him. Under the mistaken belief that
he is acting in self-defense, Defendant
stabs victim to death.

III. Defendant is charged with indecent

exposure. His mental illness renders him
unable to control his sexual impulses.
He was arrested after strolling naked in
a public park.

(C)
(D)

I only

I and II

8. Which of the following statements regarding
the entrapment defense is LEAST accurate:

(A)

(B)

It is unconstitutional for the government
to "entrap" a defendant where the defen-
dant lacks a predisposition to commit an
offense.
In most states if the defendant asserts an
entrapment defense, the defendant can-
not at the same time deny the commis-
sion of the offense. However, in federal
prosecutions the entrapment defense is
available even though the defendant
denies one or more elements of the
crime charged.

(D)

(C) Entrapment by estoppel is a recognized
defense where a government official
falsely assures a defendant that his act is
lawful and the defendant reasonably
relies on that advice.
If an undercover federal agent supplies
contraband (e.g., cocaine) to a willing
buyer, the buyer has been entrapped as a
matter of law. Then the prosecution must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant-buyer had a predisposition to
commit the criminal act prior to first
being approached by a government
agent.

Question 9 is based on the following fact situation.	

Question 10 is based on the following fact situation.

10. In which of the following situations is

Defendant most likely to be found guilty of
manslaughter rather than murder?

Not intending to kill, Defendant hits a
person over the head with a baseball bat.
As a result, the person dies from head
injuries.
Not intending to kill, Defendant throws
a baseball off the top of a four-story
apartment building onto a busy public
street below. The baseball strikes a
pedestrian, killing her.
Not intending to kill, Defendant rapes
victim in a remote area of the desert.
Defendant then drives off leaving victim
alone in the sweltering heat. The next
day, victim dies from exposure as she's
unable to reach the nearest town eight
miles away.

(D) Not intending to kill, Defendant, at a

party, pushes a nine year-old child into a
swimming pool and the youngster
drowns.

Beater was employed as a chemist for the DuPont
Corporation. After work each afternoon, Beater
would customarily have a couple of martinis at
Schooner's Tavern with his cronies before returning
home. When Beater got intoxicated, he often
became violent and physically abused his wife,
Beatee. One evening, Beater came home drunk and
asked Beatee, "What's for dinner?" Beatee replied,
"Your favorite, Dear, hot dogs and beans." Irritated,
Beater slapped Beatee several times across the face
and said, "I'm sick of hot dogs every night. Can't
you ever make anything else?" He then stormed out
of the apartment and told Beatee that he was going
to the bar to have some beef jerkies and beer for
dinner.

A couple hours later, Beatee was looking out the
apartment window when she saw Beater staggering
across the street. He was visibly intoxicated and
clearly had trouble keeping his balance. When
Beater reached the middle of the street, he col-
lapsed and fell face down on the pavement. Seeing
her husband lying in the street, Beatee's initial reac-
tion was to go outside and assist him. However, she
decided not to because she was still angry for the
beating she received earlier in the evening. Minutes
later, Spud was driving his car at an excessive rate
of speed and struck and killed Beater. Spud failed
to see Beater lying in the street because his car
lights were not functioning.

9.	

If Beatee is subsequently charged with
Beater's murder, she should be found

(A) guilty of murder, because she had a duty

to assist him

(B) guilty of murder, only if the jury finds

that she intended to cause her husband's
death

(C) not guilty of murder, but guilty of

manslaughter

(D) not guilty of either murder or

manslaughter, because her failure to
assist Beater was not the actual cause of
his death

Victim had a serious back condition that resulted
from his military duties while stationed in Iraq.
Following his return home, Physician warned him
that if he ever injured his back, even in a slight
accident or by lifting a heavy object, he could be
permanently paralyzed. Defendant was aware of
Victim's medical condition. One day, after learning
that Victim was dating Defendant's ex-wife,
Defendant became upset and decided to cut off the
legs of Victim's favorite chair, which he did. The
next day, when Victim sat down in his favorite
chair, the chair toppled over and Victim was thrown
to the floor. Victim was immediately taken to the
hospital, but died the next day because of his back's
weak condition. Defendant is charged with the
offense of murder.

Murder in this jurisdiction is defined as the "unlaw-
ful killing of another person with malice afore-
thought." First-degree murder is defined as "pre-
meditated and deliberate killing or any killing dur-
ing the commission of burglary, rape, robbery or
arson. Second-degree murder is all other killings at
common law. Manslaughter is defined as any
unlawful killing without malice when the defendant
acts in the "heat of the blood."

Defendant claims he is not guilty of murder
because he did not intend to kill Victim.

11. Defendant should most likely be found

(A) guilty of first-degree murder
(B) guilty of second-degree murder
(C) not guilty of murder if he was unaware
of Victim's pre-existing medical
condition

(D) not guilty of murder, but guilty of

manslaughter if Defendant was acting in

legs to Victim's chair

Jimbo was a professional tennis player. During a
championship match against Bork, Jimbo dived for
a shot and injured his Achilles tendon. Unable to
continue the match, Jimbo was forced to forfeit the
game to his opponent. Afterwards, the doctor deter-
mined that Jimbo's tendon was severely torn and
placed his leg in a full length cast.

That night Jimbo was extremely depressed because
he knew his injury would cause him to miss the
upcoming U.S. Open Tennis Tournament. To try to
lift his spirits, Jimbo went out for a few drinks with
his friends. As he was sitting at the bar with his
injured leg extended onto the next stool, Bork came
by. Intending to needle Jimbo, Bork said, "Gee,
Jimbo, that was some dive you took. But you know
I would have beat you anyway." Bork then began to
tap his beer bottle against Jimbo's cast. Jimbo,
already sensitive to the fact that his career was in
jeopardy, became very upset and told Bork to "get
lost." When Bork continued to tap his cast, Jimbo
picked up a beer bottle and struck Bork over the
head with it. Bork fell backwards on the floor and
died from the blow. At the time he hit Bork, Jimbo
had been drinking heavily and was visibly
intoxicated.

12. Jimbo is charged with murder. He claims that
the murder should be reduced to manslaugh-
ter. In accordance with the Model Penal Code,
the appropriate standard the court should use
to determine Jimbo's defense is that of

Question 14 is based on the following fact situation.

Yancy and Yolanda Yeager threw a high school
graduation party for their eighteen-year-old son,
York. The party was held at the Yeager home in
Mission Viejo. During the party the Yeagers served
beer and wine to York and his classmates. One of
York's teenage friends, Trina Twilley, became
inebriated after drinking three beers at the party.

When the party ended, Trina decided to drive home
in her automobile despite being intoxicated. She
drove through a red light and crashed into a vehicle
driven by Marshall Macon. Marshall, who was
operating his car with due diligence, was killed in
the accident.

The minimum drinking age for alcoholic beverages
in this jurisdiction is twenty-one. Thereafter, Trina
was prosecuted for involuntary manslaughter. Yancy
and Yolanda were charged with the misdemeanor
offense of furnishing liquor to a minor.

13. Assume for the purposes of this question that

Trina was acquitted but Yancy and Yolanda
were convicted. Following Trina's acquittal,
the prosecuting attorney decided to prosecute
Yancy and Yolanda for involuntary
manslaughter. Which of the following would
provide the defendants with their best
defense?

(A) Double Jeopardy.
(B) Res Judicata.
(C) Collateral Estoppel.
(D) Their actions were not the proximate

Belle and Ramirez were unemployed basket
weavers who had recently been terminated from
their jobs. As they were commiserating their
misfortune, Belle thought of a great "get rich
quick" scheme to defraud his insurance company.
Belle told Ramirez that he was insured under a
State Farm policy covering personal injuries. He
suggested that Ramirez shoot him in the arm in a
fake robbery attempt so that he could file a phony
insurance claim to recover damages for his injury.
In this jurisdiction it is a felony to file a false
insurance claim.

As part of their scheme, Ramirez went to Belle's
home one evening with a loaded pistol. They were
standing together in the kitchen discussing how to
best implement their plan. Finally, Belle told
Ramirez to shoot him in the arm and then flee from
the residence. After being shot, Belle planned to
call 911 and have an ambulance transport him to
the hospital where he would be treated for his
wound. Following Belle's instruction, Ramirez pro-
ceeded to shoot Belle in the arm. Thereupon, Belle
telephoned 911 to report the shooting and requested
an ambulance immediately be sent to his home.

Believing that Belle only suffered a superficial arm
wound, Ramirez drove home after the shooting. The
bullet, however, severed an artery and Belle began
to bleed quite profusely. Before the ambulance
arrived, Belle lost consciousness from the loss of
blood and passed out on the kitchen floor. When
the paramedics arrived at Belle's home, they were
unable to revive him and he was pronounced dead
at the scene.

14. Which of the following is the most serious
crime for which Ramirez should be found
guilty?

(A) Felony-murder

Intent to inflict serious bodily injury
murder

(C) Assault with a deadly weapon

Justin was an unemployed auto worker who lived
outside Detroit in the town of Southfield. Unable to
pay his rent, Justin was desperately in need of cash.
To alleviate his unfortunate predicament, Justin
decided to rob Campy's Compost, a neighborhood
convenience store. He planned to use a toy pistol
that resembled a real gun. At no time did Justin
intend to injure anybody.

The following day, Justin entered Campy's with the
toy pistol tucked under his shirt. As he approached
the counter, the gun slipped from his shirt and
rolled onto the floor. As Justin went to retrieve it,
Campy, the proprietor, saw what was taking place
and pulled out his own pistol. Believing that a
robbery was afoot, Campy fired his gun at Justin.
The bullet missed Justin but struck a customer,
killing her instantly. Justin then fled without taking
any money.

each pledge was required to perform an act to
demonstrate his courage and manhood.

Accompanied by a group of ZEM members, Skakel
went to the State Street overpass that extended
across Interstate Highway 95. The overpass was ele-
vated at an upper level approximately fifty feet
above the highway.

Skakel then pulled out a five pound bowling ball
that he had been carrying in a bag. He lobbed the
ball from the overpass onto the highway below.
Skakel had hoped that the ball would fall harm-
lessly to the pavement. However, the ball crashed
through the front windshield of a car driven by
Mahorn. The bowling ball struck Mahorn causing
him to lose control of his vehicle. The car swerved
across the highway and crashed into a telephone
pole. Mahorn was killed in the wreckage.

In this jurisdiction first degree murder is defined as
any willful killing of another human being commit-
ted with premeditation or deliberation. Second
degree murder covers all other unlawful killings
with express or implied malice aforethought.
Manslaughter is defined as any homicide commit-
ted as a result of adequate provocation or caused by
defendant's criminal negligent conduct.

16. If Skakel is charged with criminal homicide,

he should be found guilty of

(A) murder in the first degree
(B) murder in the second degree
(C) manslaughter
(D) none of the above

top of the desk, picked it up and placed it inside her
pocketbook. She then walked across the hallway to
the bathroom and poured the medicine down the
toilet. Later that same afternoon, Professor Bork
had a violent asthma attack and went to his office
urgently in need of his medicine. Unable to find his
medicine, Professor Bork's breathing became seri-
ously impaired and he lost consciousness. A few
minutes later, Professor Bork was found dead lying
on his office floor. An autopsy report listed the
cause of death as an acute asthma attack and con-
cluded that he would have survived had he taken
his medicine.

21. If Vinnie is charged with conspiracy for

Professor Bork's death, under the Model Penal

Question 21 is based on the following fact situation.

Margo Miranda and Tyler Tarlow were third-year
students at New York University Law School.
During their last semester Margo and Tyler were
enrolled in Professor Bork's Morality of the Law
class. Professor Bork, who had a reputation as
being NYU's most unpopular faculty member
because of his perennial low grades, failed Margo
and Tyler. On account of their failing "F" grades,
Margo and Tyler did not have enough credits to
graduate and were forced to attend summer school.

Shortly thereafter, Margo and Tyler were in the law
school lounge and discussing how much they hated
Professor Bork. Margo and Tyler both knew that
Professor Bork suffered from a serious asthma con-
dition which necessitated frequently taking medi-
cine to assist in his breathing. Margo, who was
aware that Professor Bork kept his medicine locked
in a desk drawer in his office, suggested that they
take his medicine and throw it away. Tyler agreed
that it was a great idea and said, "Well, he may have
an asthma attack and need his medicine." Margo
then responded, "Yea. Let's hope he does and then
he won't be able to breathe." Unknown to either
Margo or Tyler, their conversation was overheard by
Vinnie Del Negro another student who Professor
Bork had flunked.

Vinnie who also hated Professor Bork, decided to
join Margo and Tyler and participate in their plan.
Although Vinnie didn't say anything to either
Margo or Tyler, he immediately went to Professor
Bork's office, broke into his locked desk with a
penknife and found the bottle of medicine. He then
left the bottle on top of the desk so it could easily
be found by Margo and Tyler. Vinnie then hurriedly
left the room. A few minutes later, Margo and Tyler
went to Professor Bork's office. As they were about
to enter, Tyler got "cold feet" and said, "I've
changed my mind...I don't want to go through with
this." As Tyler started to walk away, Margo said,
"You coward. I'll handle this slimeball by myself."

Divoc and Igor were short-order cooks who worked
at Zucky's Restaurant in Hampton Heights. Divoc
was extremely displeased with his job and con-
stantly complained about the low wages and long
hours. One day Divoc approached Igor and told him
about a foolproof scheme to rob a local bank. At
first Igor thought Divoc was kidding and shrugged
off the suggestion as though it were a joke. But
Divoc persisted and asked Igor to assist him in the
robbery by driving the getaway car. Igor then
changed his mind and agreed to participate in the
bank robbery.

On the day appointed for the commission of the
crime, Igor drove over to Divoc's house and picked
him up. Thereupon, Divoc instructed Igor to drive
to the Evergreen Bank where the holdup was to
take place. On the way to the bank, Igor explained
that he needed to stop and buy a pack of cigarettes.
Moments later, Igor saw a 7-11 Store, which was
located about three miles from the bank, and pulled
into the parking lot. While Divoc waited in the car,
Igor went inside the store and started having second
thoughts about his involvement in the robbery. He
then decided to withdraw from the crime and hur-
ried to a pay telephone at the back of the store.

He called the local 911 emergency number and told
the dispatcher that a robbery was about to take
place at the Evergreen Bank and please notify the
police immediately. The dispatcher, however,
thought that Igor was a crank caller and did not
take him seriously. After Igor realized that the dis-
patcher was not going to take any affirmative
action, he then reached into his pocket to get a
quarter to call the police. Unfortunately, Igor did
not have any more pocket change to make another
call. He then proceeded back to the parking lot and
noticed that his car was missing. Igor had left his
keys in the car and the engine running when he
went inside the store. When he didn't emerge right
away, Divoc got nervous and drove off by himself

While Igor pondered his next move, Divoc went to
the bank and carried out the robbery. After collect-
ing his booty, Divoc fled the crime scene in Igor's
car. With the police in hot pursuit, Divoc ran
through a red light and crashed into a truck driven
by Puhl. Divoc and Puhl were both killed in the
collision.

Question 25 is based on the following fact situation.

Jesse was the leader of the notorious "Hole In The
Wall Gang" which consisted of a group of thugs
who committed a string of robberies, burglaries and
thefts in the Sheepmeadow section of Brownsville.
After committing a number of smaller crimes
mostly in the residential section of town, Jesse
decided to go "big time" and rob the First National
Bank in the heart of downtown Brownsville.

As part of the plan, Jesse and James would enter
the bank while Raven, the only female member of
the gang, would drive the getaway car. As they were
driving to the bank on the morning of the robbery,
Jesse saw a hitchhiker thumbing a ride. He ordered
Raven to stop the car and pick up the hitchhiker.
When the hitchhiker named Mitch entered the car,
Jesse asked him where he was going. Mitch
responded that he was going to Baytown which was
located about 5 miles north of Brownsville.

A few minutes later, the car pulled up in front of
the bank and Jesse turned to Mitch and said,
"Listen, buddy, we're going inside and rob this
place. I want you to stay in the car with Raven and
help her keep a lookout for any cops." Startled by
the chain of events Mitch feigned agreement by
shaking his head.

Jesse and James then entered the bank and bran-
dishing their weapons ordered everyone on the
floor. They went to the nearest counter and com-

Sissy Seagull and her boyfriend, Lex Laker, went to
the movies to see Blue Velvet, a picture starring
Dennis Hopper. Neither Sissy nor Lex particularly
liked the film. About half-way through the movie,
they went to the lobby and purchased some popcorn
and soda. As they were walking back inside to their
seats, Lex turned to Sissy and said, "You know this
movie stinks...let's just leave." Sissy responded,
"O.K., but let's have some fun first. After we go
back inside, why don't you scream 'FIRE.' It'll be
fun to see everyone run for their lives."

Lex and Sissy then returned to their seats. A few
minutes later, Lex lit a match inside the theatre and
threw it down the aisle. As he did so, Lex stood up
and screamed, "FIRE! FIRE!" This caused a panic
as everyone rushed for the exits. During the stam-
pede that followed, Hilda Hilton, one of the movie-
goers, got crushed in the human wave trying to
leave the theatre. She suffered a broken leg and
multiple abrasions. A subsequent police investiga-
tion revealed that the match thrown by Lex black-
ened the floor of the theatre.

The Ames Penal Code provides:

"Section 21. An assault is an unlawful
attempt, with or without present ability, to
commit a battery on the person of another. It
is a misdemeanor punishable by imprison-
ment of up to 6 months."

Harry Sapiens was a lawyer who worked in the law
firm of Scylla and Charybdis, located in
Amityville, Ames. Harry, who had a reputation of
being a prankster, decided to play a practical joke
on Seymour Scylla, the senior partner of the law
firm. Harry donned a cowboy mask and entered
Mr. Scylla's office. As Mr. Scylla was talking on
the phone with his back to the door, Harry pulled
out a toy cap gun and said, "This is a stickup...give
me your wallet or I shoot." When Mr. Scylla turned
around to face Harry, he pulled the trigger of the
gun. This caused the toy pistol to make a loud
noise, but Mr. Scylla was not struck by anything.

Although Mr. Scylla was not frightened, he fired
Harry because of the incident citing unprofessional
conduct. Harry was subsequently charged with
criminal assault under the above mentioned penal
code statute. At trial, Harry testified that he was
only playing a practical joke on Mr. Scylla and was
trying to scare him as a harmless prank.

26. If the jury believes Harry, they should find

him

(A) guilty, because he intended to frighten

(B)

Mr. Scylla
guilty, because the statute does not
require the present ability to commit a
battery

(C) not guilty, because Harry did not intend

to cause physical injury to Mr. Scylla
(D) not guilty, because the facts state that
Mr. Scylla was not frightened

Marshall and Tucker were longtime friends who
had served in Vietnam together. Marshall was
despondent after experiencing a number of
personal tragedies. After getting laid off from his
job as a pizza deliveryman, Marshall's wife, Flo,
divorced him. Following the divorce, Marshall's
home was destroyed by a tornado and all his
personal belongings were destroyed. To make
matters even worse, Marshall lost his life savings
when he purchased stock in a west Texas oil
company that went bankrupt.

Knowing that Marshall was extremely disconsolate,
Tucker suggested that they get together and have a
few beers at a local watering hole. As they were
drinking, Marshall told Tucker that he was planning
to burglarize the home of his wealthy aunt, Juanita,
and steal her jewelry. Marshall asked Tucker if he
was interested in taking part in the burglary and
assisting him. When Tucker refused, Marshall said,
"O.K. chickenshit, I'm gonna commit the crime
myself, but I have a proposition for you. If you let
me stash the jewels at your house until the heat's
off, I'll give you her diamond necklace." Tucker
agreed.

Two nights later, while Juanita was away on vaca-
tion, Marshall broke into his aunt's home and stole
her jewelry which was worth over $100,000.
Afterwards, Marshall went to Tucker's house.
Tucker permitted him to come inside and told
Marshall he could leave the jewels in the attic. The
next day, Tucker had second thoughts about his
criminal involvement. He immediately called the
police who came to his home and recovered all of
the stolen jewels. Upon questioning, Tucker told the
police that Marshall committed the burglary. The
police subsequently arrested Marshall and Tucker.

28. Tucker should be found guilty for which of

the following crimes?

(A) Receiving of stolen property only
(B) Receiving of stolen property and acces-

sory after the fact to burglary

(C) Receiving of stolen property and con-

spiracy to commit burglary

Customer went to a local Wal-Smart store to buy
some suntan oil which she expected to use on her
vacation the following week in Florida. She found
the brand she wanted, and decided to browse
around. As she walked down the next aisle, she saw
an expensive camera she really liked, but could not
afford to pay for it. She picked up the camera,
examined it, and decided to steal it. She put the
camera underneath her sweater, but noticed an
employee watching her from the back of the store.
Because she feared getting arrested for shoplifting,
she quickly removed the camera from her sweater
and put it back on the shelf, and left the store. She
had put the suntan oil in her pocket and inadver-
tently forgot to pay for it. When she got home, she
realized her mistake and decided to return to the
store and pay for the suntan oil.

Johnson took a diamond ring to a pawnshop and
borrowed $20 on it. It was agreed that the loan was
to be repaid within 60 days and if it was not, the
pawnshop owner, Defendant, could sell the ring. A
week before expiration of the 60 days, Defendant
had an opportunity to sell the ring to a customer for
$125. He did so, thinking it unlikely that Johnson
would repay the loan and if he did, Defendant
would be able to handle him somehow, even by
paying him for the ring if necessary. Two days later,
Johnson came in with the money to reclaim his
ring. Defendant told him that it had been stolen
when his shop was burglarized one night and that,
therefore, he was not responsible for the loss.

Larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses are

A statute in State Red reads in relevant part; "Any
person over the age of eighteen who knowingly
engages in sexual intercourse with a person under
the age of sixteen is guilty of statutory rape."
Doofus attended a convention for librarians in the
city of Lost Virtues in State Red. He and several
other librarians visited the Pussy Kat Club, which
featured "exotic dancers." After performing her act
on stage, exotic dancer Bunny sat down at Doofus'
table and asked him, "Will you buy me a drink,
honey?" Doofus bought Bunny several glasses of
champagne at $15 a glass, and arranged to meet her
at a nearby motel, The Love Nest, after closing
time. Bunny met Doofus at the motel and they
engaged in sexual intercourse. Following their love-
making, Bunny asked Doofus for $200, but Doofus
responded, "This was for love; I'm not going to
ruin this beautiful experience by involving money
in it." Bunny responded, "I think I'll call the police
because I'm only 15 years old." Although Bunny
was mature in appearance, she was one month shy
of her sixteenth birthday when she engaged in inter-
course with Doofus. The police arrested Doofus
and asked him whether he had asked Bunny how
old she was. Doofus replied, "Golly, no, officer.
She's a stripper!" Doofus was charged with statu-
tory rape.

At Doofus' trial, the judge gave the following jury
instruction, over objections by the defense: "If
you find that the defendant engaged in sexual
intercourse with the prosecutrix (Ms. Bunny), there
is a presumption that the defendant was aware of
her age."

38. Was the jury instruction proper?

(A) Yes, because statutory rape is a strict lia-

bility offense.

(B) Yes, because Doofus had a duty, under

these circumstances, to inquire as to
Bunny's age.

(C) No, because Doofus did not know that

she was underage.

(D) No, because the jury instruction shifted
the burden of proof on an element of the

When Rowdy was handed the wrong order, he went
berserk. In an uncontrollable rage, he knocked over
the table and screamed unprintable obscenities at
Dot. Unknown to Rowdy, two police officers were
sitting at the counter and witnessed the entire inci-
dent. They immediately placed Rowdy under arrest
and charged him with disorderly conduct.

He was taken to the police station where he was
booked. Since it was late at night, Rowdy was told
that he would not be arraigned until the next morn-
ing. As part of standard operating procedure,
Rowdy's possessions were taken from him and
inventoried. While he was in custody,
Elizabethtown police detectives received a tip that
Rowdy was involved in an unsolved burglary.

Dumpor owned a forty acre tract of farmland
located in a rural section of northeastern Kansas.
He conducted a small farming operation on the
property and grew corn, broccoli, and other vegeta-
bles which he sold to local produce companies.
One day, the county police received an anonymous
tip that Dumpor was growing marijuana on his
farm. Acting on this information, the police flew
over his farm in a surveillance plane and took
pictures of the landscape using a special camera
with a telescopic lens.

After the pictures were developed, they revealed
what appeared to be marijuana plants growing
alongside a section of the corn crop. In an
unmarked vehicle, two undercover police officers
then drove to Dumpor's farm. They climbed over a
chain-linked fence and walked around the farm.
While surveying the terrain, they came upon a
small marijuana patch. The officers then noticed
fresh footprints that led from the marijuana patch to
a nearby cabin.

Believing that marijuana was being stored in the
cabin, the police officers decided to immediately
secure a search warrant. After obtaining the war-
rant, they returned to Dumpor's farm and entered
the cabin. Inside the cabin, the police found a large
cache of marijuana that had been recently har-
vested. Dumpor was then arrested and charged with
unlawful possession of marijuana.

43. Dumpor files a pretrial motion to suppress the

marijuana as evidence on grounds of an ille-

may have been unlawful

three young children. His oldest son, Jeffrey,
wanted to play little league baseball but didn't own

Store in Queens and stole a black outfielder's glove
for his son. As Mike was leaving the store, a clerk
saw the glove bulging under Maier's jacket. The
clerk ran outside and yelled to a nearby police offi-
cer, "Stop that man, he just stole a baseball glove."
The police officer proceeded to detain Maier. At the
time he was being detained, Maier did not respond
to the clerk's accusation. Thereafter Maier was
taken to the police station and charged with larceny.
At the stationhouse, he was given his Miranda
warnings for the first time.

At trial, Maier took the stand and testified on his
own behalf and denied committing the crime.

posed the question that if the defendant was inno-
cent, why did he remain silent and not deny culpa-
bility at the time of his detention. Defendant's
attorney objected to the prosecutor's comment.

47. The trial court judge will in all likelihood rule

that the prosecutor's comment was

(A)

(B)

improper, because it violates defendant's
Miranda protection
improper, because the defendant has the
right to remain silent

(C) proper, because no Miranda warnings

were given when Maier was detained by

Defendant attempted to drive home in
her automobile. She fell asleep at the
wheel and crashed into another vehicle,
injuring the driver. Shortly after the
accident, a police officer came on the
scene and arrested Defendant, charging
her with D.U.I. The Defendant was then
given her Miranda warnings and trans-
ported to the police station. Upon ques-
tioning, Defendant, who was still highly
intoxicated, waived her Miranda rights
and made an incriminating statement.

(B) Defendant stabbed victim after a violent
argument. Following the victim's death,
the police arrested Defendant and
charged him with murder. He was trans-
ported to the stationhouse where
Miranda warnings were given.
Afterwards the Defendant was interro-
gated and proceeded to waive his
Miranda rights. He then confessed to
committing the crime. At trial, a psychi-
atrist testified that Defendant was men-
tally ill and his confession was not the
result of a knowing and intelligent waiver.

(C) Defendant was a 15-year-old boy who
was a high school sophomore. He pos-
sessed normal intelligence and experi-
ence for a youth of his age. One night he
and two friends attended a concert in
Central Park. After the concert, Defendant
and his friends went on a "wilding"
spree assaulting and robbing a number
of victims in the park. The next day
Defendant was arrested and received
proper Miranda warnings. After being
subjected to persistent questioning for
two hours, Defendant waived his
Miranda rights and made a confession.
At trial, Defendant claims that he did not
make a knowing and intelligent waiver.

(D) Defendant was a 16-year-old juvenile

who was in police custody on suspicion
of murder. He was given his Miranda
warnings and then requested to have his
probation officer present. He had been
on probation for a series of juvenile
offenses. His request was denied. During
a brief interrogation, Defendant pro-
ceeded to waive his Miranda rights and
made incriminating statements that
linked him with the crime. At trial,
Defendant's lawyer claims that his
waiver was ineffective because his
request to see the probation officer was
the equivalent of asking for a lawyer.

Question 49 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 50 is based on the following fact situation.

Dave was arrested on a charge of receiving stolen
property. After being properly advised of his
Miranda rights, Dave invoked his right to remain
silent and requested to see his attorney. Several
days later, Dave was arraigned and placed in a cell
with Innis. Unknown to Dave, Innis was a police
informant who had been assigned to Dave's cell
with specific instructions to listen to Dave in order
to obtain information about Dave's crime. Innis
was expressly told not to ask any questions about
the crime, but to "act normal" and "be yourself."
While in the cell together, Innis boasted about the
number of crimes he had committed without being
caught. Not to be outdone, Dave responds with
several statements implicating himself in a large
stolen property enterprise. When Dave is brought
to trial, the prosecution seeks to put Innis on the
stand to testify regarding his jail cell conversations
with Dave.

49. The trial court should rule that this testimony

is

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

inadmissible, because it is violative of
Dave's rights against self-incrimination
inadmissible, because it is violative of
Dave's right to counsel
admissible, because Dave had been
given proper Miranda warnings
admissible, because there was no inter-
rogation

The state of Marlboro has recently enacted the fol-
lowing anti-smoking statute:

"It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to
smoke a cigarette, cigar or pipe in any restau-
rant, bar, cafe or other establishment within
the state that serves food, beer, wine or
liquor. Whoever violates this ordinance shall
be fined not more than five hundred dollars,
or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or
both."

Nick O'Teen was tried in state court for violating
the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evi-
dence consisted of the testimony of Philip Morris,
a patron of Chesterfield's Bar and Grill, who was
disturbed by O'Teen's cigar smoking at the restau-
rant. At the close of all the evidence, O'Teen's
lawyer moved for a dismissal of the charge on the
ground that applying the statute to smoking at a
public restaurant would violate the defendant's
equal protection rights. The trial judge agreed and
granted the motion.

The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a
statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such
circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the
prosecutor decided not to reprosecute O'Teen.
However, the city attorney in the city in which
Chesterfield's was located then sought to prosecute
O'Teen for the same incident under the city's anti-
smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state
statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only
witness Philip Morris, who testified at O'Teen's
first trial. O'Teen moved to dismiss on the ground
that the prosecution of the city charge would violate
his rights against double jeopardy.

50. The court should

(A) grant the motion, because jeopardy
attached in the first prosecution
(B) grant the motion, because the law and

the evidence will be identical at the sec-
ond trial

(C) deny the motion, because the city and
the state are separate sovereigns

(D) deny the motion, because the granting of
O'Teen's motion to dismiss was not a
judgment of acquittal since it did not
resolve any factual elements of the
statutory offense

Question 1 is based on the following fact situation. 	

Question 3 is based on the following fact situation.

Pudge sued Dickens for personal injuries arising
from an automobile accident. Pudge claimed that
Dickens drove through a stop sign at an intersection
without first coming to a complete stop. Dickens
denied driving through the stop sign and contended
that he came to a full stop before entering the inter-
section. At trial, Pudge called Wagner to testify that
he witnessed the accident and that Dickens did not
stop at the stop sign.

On cross-examination, Wagner admits that he was
standing 200 feet away from the intersection when
he witnessed the accident. Defense counsel thus
claims that Wagner was too far away to accurately
see whether Dickens failed to stop at the stop sign.

3.	

Dickens' attorney moves to have the judge
strike Wagner's testimony based upon the fact
that Wagner did not accurately observe the
facts to which he has testified. In responding
to defendant's objection, the judge should
admit the testimony if she finds that

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

it is supported by a preponderance of the
evidence
it is supported by clear and convincing
evidence
there is sufficient evidence for the jury
to conclude that the witness has first-
hand knowledge
it is relevant to prove a fact in issue

Dryden is tried on a charge of driving while
intoxicated. When Dryden was booked at the
police station, a videotape was made that
showed him unsteady, abusive, and speaking
in a slurred manner. If the prosecutor lays a
foundation properly identifying the tape,
should the court admit it in evidence and
permit it to be shown to the jury?

(A) Yes, because it is an admission.
(B) Yes, because its probative value is not

substantially outweighed by unfair prej-
udice.

(C) No, because the privilege against self-

incrimination is applicable.

(D) No, because specific instances of con-
duct cannot be proved by extrinsic evi-
dence.

Question 2 is based on the following fact situation.

Kaufman was arrested and charged with robbery.
Upon being taken into custody, he was given his
Miranda rights and then taken to the police station
for booking. While at the stationhouse, Kaufman
told the arresting officer, O'Toole, that he was
prepared to make a confession. O'Toole then
turned on a video recorder and videotaped
Kaufman's confession.

2.	

At trial, the prosecution called O'Toole to
testify to the incriminating statements that
Kaufman made in his confession. Upon
objection by Kaufman's attorney, O'Toole's
proposed testimony is

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

inadmissible, because the videotape is
the best evidence of Kaufman's
confession
inadmissible, because it is hearsay not
within any recognized exception

hand knowledge of the confession

his Miranda rights before eliciting the

(D) Decker is being prosecuted for bigamy
resulting from a common law marriage
to Grace, followed by a ceremonial mar-
riage to Rebecca. Decker contends that
he was never married to Grace. At trial,
the prosecution calls Rebecca as a wit-
ness. She refuses to testify invoking a
statute that excuses a "spouse" from
being called in a criminal proceeding to
testify against a marital partner. Under
such a statute, Rebecca would not be
considered a spouse if Decker already
was married to Grace when he pur-
ported to marry Rebecca. In order to
determine whether Rebecca may invoke
such a statute, the issue which must ulti-
mately be decided is whether Decker
was married to Grace. Who decides this
factual question?

Question 4 is based on the following fact situation.

Under which of the following situations does
the jury, not the judge, make the final deter-
mination of the factual question in issue?

(A) Weaver is on trial for the murder of

Poole. During the trial, Jasper proposes
to testify that moments before Poole
died, he came upon the victim, who had
been severely beaten and covered with
blood, and that Poole told him. "Weaver
stabbed me." Before admitting Jasper's
testimony, a question arises as to
whether Poole was under a sense of
impending death when he made his
statement. Who decides the factual ques-
tion?

(B) Blair was employed as a truck driver for
Shell Oil Company. On his way to make
a delivery, he drove through a red light
and crashed into Plank's car. Plank sued
Shell to recover damages for injuries
suffered in the collision. At trial, Plank
proposes to testify that immediately
after the accident, Blair said, "I was
lighting my cigarette and didn't see the
red light." Before admitting Plank's tes-
timony, a question arises as to whether
Blair was under the necessary state of
excitement in order for his statement to
qualify as an excited utterance. Who
decides this factual question?
(C) Palmer was injured when his car was

struck by a train at a railroad crossing.
Two days after the accident the engineer
was interviewed by a representative of
the state Public Utilities Commission.
Following the interview, the engineer
signed a statement concerning his ver-
sion of the accident. Thereafter, Palmer
brought suit against the railroad com-
pany to recover damages. The engineer
died before trial, and his statement is
now offered into evidence. Before
admitting the statement, a question
arises as to whether the railroad com-
pany obtained such statement in the reg-
ular course of business. Who decides
this factual question?

Knepper, London, Minkoff and Odom worked
together as computer programmers for Texas
Instruments. One afternoon they drove together in
Minkoff's car to see a Houston Astros baseball
game at the Astrodome. On their way to the sta-
dium, Minkoff was involved in an auto accident
with a vehicle driven by Ashby. Knepper was seri-
ously injured in the collision when his head went
through the front windshield. Knepper sued
Minkoff for personal injuries, claiming that
Minkoff was negligent in his operation of the motor
vehicle. In his pleadings, Minkoff alleged that
Knepper was contributorily negligent by failing to
wear his seat belt.

At trial, Minkoff called London and Odom to tes-
tify that Knepper was not wearing his seat belt at
the time of the accident. In defense, Knepper calls
Ryan to testify that he has been riding to work with
Knepper for two years and that invariably he wears
his seat belt whenever they are in the car together.

Jack Flash was a guitarist and lead singer for The
Stoners, a rock and roll band. While he was per-
forming a concert at the Altamont Convention
Center, an overhead strobe light fell on stage strik-
ing Jack. Jack suffered a fractured skull and was
hospitalized for an extended period of time.
Moonglow Visuals Inc. was hired by Altamont to
perform the strobe lighting show at the concert.

During his hospital stay, Jack sent a letter to Van
Morrison, Moonglow's president, threatening to
sue and holding Moonglow responsible for the
accident. After receiving Jack's letter, Moonglow's
attorney, Jethro Tull, visited Jack at the hospital
where he was being treated. Jethro entered Jack's
hospital room and told him, "Moonglow will pay
your medical expenses if you will give a release."
Jack remained silent and Jethro then left the room.

6.	

Thereafter Jack filed a lawsuit against
Moonglow to recover damages for his injury.
At trial, Jack seeks to introduce into evidence

Question 8 is based on the following fact situation.

Sammy Samuelson took his two children, Sonja and
Stu, to the Curtis School Fair. At the fair there were
many rides and amusements for the youngsters.
One of the highlights of the fair was a petting zoo
where children could feed baby goats, piglets and
little calves. The owner of the petting zoo was
Jethro Tull.

Children entering the petting zoo could purchase a
small package of carrots for $1 to feed the animals.
Both Sonja and Stu bought the carrots and were
walking around the zoo area feeding the animals.
Sonja approached a baby goat who began nibbling
on a carrot that she was holding. As the baby goat
was devouring the carrot, it suddenly bit Sonja's
hand causing a deep gash. Jethro, who witnessed
the incident, immediately ran to Sonja and said,
"I'm terribly sorry, I'll pay you $100."

Thereafter, Sammy, on behalf of his daughter,
sues Jethro to recover damages. During the

Question 9 is based on the following fact situation.

Brando was on trial for murder. Following a recess,
Brando was in the hallway outside the courtroom
speaking with his attorney. During their conversa-

deal." Brando's statement was overheard by the
presiding judge as he was walking down the corri-
dor to the restroom. The judge then informed the
prosecuting attorney of Brando's comment. After
trial is reconvened, the prosecutor calls the judge as
a witness to testify to what he heard the defendant
tell his attorney.

9.	

Upon objection by defendant's attorney, may
the judge be called as a witness?

(A) No, because Brando's statement was a
confidential communication and pro-
tected under the attorney-client privi-
lege.

(B) No, because a judge may not testify in a
matter over which he or she is presiding.

(C) Yes, because a judge has a duty to dis-

close incriminating evidence to the pros-

Dr. Iris, an opthalmologist, performed corneal laser
surgery on Hudson's right eye, which resulted in a
permanent loss of eyesight in that eye. Hudson sued
Dr. Iris for malpractice on the theory that the physi-
cian failed to warn her of the risk of losing her eye-
sight. Hudson based her case upon the theory that
had she been advised of such a risk, she would not
have consented to the operation. As a result,
Hudson contends that Dr. Iris lacked the "implied
consent" to perform such an operation.

On the other hand, Dr. Iris claims that she did in
fact warn Hudson that there was a risk of losing
eyesight from such an operation. At trial, Hudson
calls Peltz to testify that Dr. Iris performed a simi-
lar operation on him six months earlier. Peltz testi-

artifacts and little trinkets which he took back on
the airplane. After arriving in Minneapolis, a cus-

amount of heroin in an Aztec sculpture that
Hemlock was bringing back from Mexico. He was
immediately arrested and prosecuted for illegal
possession and importation of a controlled danger-

any drugs. He further testified that he was not the
owner of the artifact but was merely delivering it as
a favor for an art dealer whose acquaintance he

Sadie Sadler was driving home after attending the
opening night performance of the musical Cats at the
Shubert Theatre. Sadie was turning her automobile
into her driveway at about 11:00 p.m. when she
stopped to light a cigarette. It was a dark and rainy
evening and Sadie didn't realize that the rear of her
car extended out into the south bound lane of
Palisades Road. As she was lighting her cigarette,
her car was struck by a vehicle driven by Morley
Morgan. The front bumper of Morley's car rammed
into the rear bumper of Sadie's car, causing it to
overturn. Sadie was seriously injured in the collision.

Sadie sued Morley to recover for the injuries she
suffered in the accident. At trial, Sadie called Nettie
Newman, a neighbor, to testify. Nettie testified that
she was outside walking her dog when the accident
occurred. She further testified that she saw
Morley's car "going at least seventy miles per hour"
when he crashed into Sadie. Nettie denied making
any contrary statements regarding the accident.

During Morley's case, Morley called Patrolman
Paye, the police officer who investigated the
accident, to testify. Paye testified that Nettie made
a statement to him that he (Paye) had passed on to
the other officer, who ultimately wrote up the
official police report. Thereupon, Paye identified
the police report, described how it was formulated
and kept, and said that he had signed the report
without reading it. He also testified that he had no
independent recollection of Nettie's statements
following the accident. In the report, Nettie is
quoted as saying that Morley was traveling at
twenty miles per hour.

report into evidence to impeach Nettie, the
evidence will be

Nathan Natelson was involved in an auto accident
as he was driving to work one morning. His car col-
lided with an automobile driven by Lisa Lobo. She
then sued Nathan for negligent operation of a motor
vehicle.

At trial, Lisa's attorney called Zoe Zooman to tes-
tify. Zoe is Nathan's State Farm Insurance represen-
tative. Zoe is prepared to testify that two weeks
after the accident, Nathan went to her office to dis-
cuss his automobile coverage. During their conver-
sation, Nathan asked her the following question:
"Can I lose my car insurance for driving recklessly?"

21. Upon proper objection by Nathan's attorney,
will Zoe be permitted to testify to Nathan's
inquiry?

(A) Yes, because it is an admission by a

party-opponent.

(B) Yes, because it is a declaration against

Blue, an independent taxi driver, took his car to
Aamco Transmissions to have the transmission
repaired. Owens, Aamco's employee, was working
on the transmission when the hydraulic lift broke.
This caused the car to plummet on top of Owens,
injuring him. Blue, who happened to be standing
nearby, saw the incident and rushed over to help
Owens. As Blue tried to free Owens from the metal
entanglement, the hydraulic pump (an apparatus
connected to the lift) suddenly burst, propelling a
sharp metallic fragment into Blue's stomach. Blue
received a deep laceration wound but was not other-
wise injured.

Blue then initiated suit against Aamco based on
negligent maintenance of the hydraulic lift. At trial,
Blue called the chief inspector for the state
Department of Occupation Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), who testified about an
official report of the accident as prepared by an
OSHA investigator. Blue proposes to introduce a

Carruth is on trial and charged with murdering
Nicolette, his former girlfriend. In its case-in-chief
the prosecution contends Carruth killed Nicolette
because he had gotten her pregnant and she refused
to have an abortion. Nicolette had been shot and
killed in the bedroom of her home.

Officer O'Brien, who was the first policeman to
arrive at the murder scene, discovered Nicolette's
body. While O'Brien was in the bedroom awaiting
the coroner, he saw Nicolette's open diary on her
desk. The diary, which was confiscated by the
police, was properly authenticated and handwritten
by Nicolette.

25. During Carruth's murder trial,. the prosecu-

In the city of Southfield, Morris Avenue is a four-
lane highway that runs north to south. In the center
of Southfield's business district, Morris Avenue
intersects with Kings Highway, a one-way street
for westbound traffic. Morris Avenue and Kings
Highway intersect at right angles with the
intersection controlled by a traffic signal.

One afternoon Dawn Doucette, a motorist, was
driving her car along Morris Avenue when she
struck Pasqual Pignatano, a bicyclist, who entered
the intersection from Kings Highway. Pignatano
was seriously injured in the accident and sued
Doucette to recover damages for personal injuries.
There were no witnesses to the accident. Doucette
claims that the traffic light was green at the time
she entered the intersection. Pignatano now has
amnesia and cannot remember how the accident
occurred.

26. At trial, Pignatano's attorney calls Toby

Templer to testify. Templer proposes to testify
that she was in the emergency room at the
hospital when Pignatano was brought in fol-

that while Pignatano was being treated for his
injuries, the nurse asked him, "How did you

North was charged with violating the Bolin Act by
illegally selling armaments to Iraq without a gov-

selling the weapons (which included missiles,
rocket launchers, bazookas and ammunition) to
agents of Saddam Hussein. In his defense, however,
North testified that he did not sell the armaments as
a private citizen, but rather he was working for the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In rebutting
North's testimony, the government called Casey, a
high ranking CIA official, to the stand. He testified
that if North were in fact a CIA agent, that infor-
mation would ordinarily be contained in the CIA's
employment records. Asked whether North's
employment records were on file with the CIA,
Casey then testified, "I have searched the CIA
employment records diligently, but I haven't found
any documentation that Mr. North was employed by
the agency."

Dr. Dee was a physician who specialized in cos-
metic surgery. He was highly skilled in breast
enlargement procedures and liposuction fat removal
techniques. For many years, Dr. Dee performed his
surgical operations on a cash only basis. The I.R.S.
subsequently audited Dr. Dee and found that he had
underpaid his taxes by failing to report his total
income over a six-year period.

Dr. Dee was then prosecuted for federal income tax
evasion by the I.R.S. At trial, the government
called Dr. Dee, as an adverse witness, to describe
his system of bookkeeping and to identify a docu-
ment that had been provided to the government by
an informer. Dr. Dee exercised his privilege against
self-incrimination and refused to identify the docu-
ment. The government then established by other
evidence that the document was in Dr. Dee's hand-
writing and appeared to be a ledger of cash receipts
that had not been reported on his income tax return.

Post sued Dean for personal injury alleged to have
been caused by Dean's negligence. A major issue
at trial was whether Post's disability was caused
solely by trauma or by a preexisting condition
of osteoarthritis.

Post called Dr. Cox, who testified that the disability
was caused by trauma. On cross-examination, Dr.
Cox testified that a medical textbook entitled
Diseases of the Joints was authoritative and that
she agreed with the substance of passages from the
textbook that she was directed to look at, but that
the passages were inapplicable to Post's condition
because they dealt with rheumatoid arthritis rather
than with the osteoarthritis that Post was alleged
to have.

Dean then called his expert, Dr. Freed, who testi-

there is no difference between the two kinds of
arthritis. Dean's counsel then asks permission to

the prosecution called Dr. Dorchester, a forensic

the statistical probability based on DNA and
linking Oliver to the crime scene was one out of

that it was statistically improbable that another
individual would have the same genetic match as

On March 1, Reed and the Sanford School entered
into a written contract providing that Reed would
be employed for one year in various capacities (ath-
letic director, teacher, football coach) in return for
an annual salary of $37,750. Shortly thereafter and
prior to the July commencement date of employ-
ment, Sanford elected to terminate its varsity foot-
ball program. The school publicly attributed the
decision to economic factors. Upon hearing this
news Reed sought out Mr. Bentley, headmaster of
the school, to inquire as to the effect, if any, of this
decision on his salary and responsibilities.

In order to resolve the matter, Mr. Bentley arranged
a meeting among various school officials to discuss
Reed's situation. Afterwards, the school sent written
notice to Reed of its intent to terminate his employ-
ment contract. Reed then commenced suit to
recover the full balance of his salary calculated on
the basis of the March 1 contract. At trial, Mr.
Bentley was called to testify. On direct examination
he testified that six people (including himself)
attended the meeting where it was decided to termi-
nate Reed's employment contract. When asked to
identify the attendees, Mr. Bentley gave the names
of four but despite trying was unable to remember
the name of the fifth person.

Question 44 is based on the following fact situation.

Amber went food shopping at Pavilion's Market.
She purchased a can of sardines which had been
produced by Fishbone Fishery. A short while later
Amber was home when she decided to prepare a
sardine sandwich. When she opened the can, to her
astonishment she saw a decomposed mouse. Amber
became very nauseous and vomited upon seeing
the mouse.

After consulting with her attorney, Amber initiated
a strict liability action against Fishbone. At trial,
Amber presented into evidence the sardine can with
the label that read Fishbone Fishery. The attorney
representing Fishbone objected to the introduction
of the label on the can.

43. The trial court should

(A) overrule the objection, because the label

is self-authenticating

(C)

(B) overrule the objection, because the label
is the best evidence showing that the can
was produced by Fishbone

Question 45 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 46 is based on the following fact situation.

Lansky was arrested and charged with arson which
in this jurisdiction is defined as the "malicious or
intentional burning of any structure or dwelling."
When Lansky was arrested, he was inside a ware-
house that was engulfed in flames. At the time he
was apprehended, the police found in his possession
a book of matches with four matches missing.

At trial, the prosecution introduced the book of
matches into evidence. Following closing argu-
ments and before the jury retired for deliberations,
the judge gave instructions concerning the law of
the case. The judge instructed the jury that it could
infer defendant's intent to set the fire based on the
fact that four matches were missing from the
matchbook. This instruction was specifically
objected to by the defense counsel.

Austin was arrested and charged with robbery.
Austin denies committing the crime and claims he
is the victim of mistaken identity. At the time of
Austin's arrest, he was unmarried but living with
his girlfriend, Ashley. While Austin was awaiting
trial, he married Ashley. During the robbery trial,
the prosecution called Ashley to testify. She is
asked to describe the clothing that Austin was wear-
ing on the morning (of the robbery) when he left
the house. The prosecution wishes to corroborate
the testimony of an earlier witness who identified
the clothing worn by the perpetrator.

being required to testify against Austin. May
Ashley refuse to testify?

(A) Yes, because Austin can prevent Ashley

Question 47 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 48 is based on the following fact situation.

Bugliosi, an attorney, represented Polanski in a
criminal rape trial. The trial ended with a "hung
jury" as the jurors were unable to reach a unani-
mous verdict as required by law. Thereafter, the
prosecution indicated that it would seek to retry
Polanski on the criminal charge. In preparation for
the new trial, Bugliosi hired Clark, a non-lawyer
jury consultant, to interview Polanski and prepare
him for a possible second trial. Clark spent two
hours interviewing Polanski.

One week later, the prosecution filed the proper
notice of intent to retry Polanski and requested a
court order allowing the prosecution to depose
Clark regarding the substance of her interview with
the defendant. Bugliosi claimed the interview was
protected by the attorney-client privilege and filed a
motion to deny issuance of the requested discovery.

47. The court should

grant Bugliosi's motion, because at a
retrial the prosecution is barred from
introducing new statements made by the
defendant in the "interests of justice"
grant Bugliosi's motion, if defendant's
interview with the consultant was
intended to be confidential because
Clark was hired by Bugliosi to provide
assistance in the rendition of legal ser-

Sonja Starbird was a patent attorney who worked as
a sole practitioner. She was an Emory Law School
graduate and had been admitted to the Georgia bar
in 1979. Recently, Sonja was sued by the Internal
Revenue Service  (I.R.S.) for nonpayment of taxes.
For three years Sonja represented Kodak Film
Company in a bitter trademark infringement action
against one of its competitors, Fuji.

During its discovery, the I.R.S. requested copies
of Sonja's billing records to Kodak as part of her
representation in the Fuji case. The I.R.S. claims
that the documents are necessary to determine
Sonja's income for the period of her alleged
underpayments.

48. Sonja has refused to turn over her billing

records in the Kodak-Fuji case to the I.R.S.
As a result, the I.R.S. has filed a motion
compelling discovery of such records. The
request should be

(A) denied, because the records are part of

the attorney's work product
(B) denied, because the attorney-client

privilege precludes the release of such

Question 2 is based on the following fact situation.

Congress held hearings for several months to
investigate reports that agents for the federal Drug
Enforcement Agency had planted drug evidence to
falsely accuse citizens of engaging in illegal drug
activity and staged armed nighttime raids of the
homes of other citizens without probable cause. At
the close of the hearings, Congress passed a new
federal statute aimed at limiting the investigation
powers of the Drug Enforcement Agency.
Concerned that the statute might be attacked as
making it appear that Congress was "soft on
crime," Congress added a non-severable provision
to the statute granting standing to "anyone who
wishes to challenge" the statute and providing that
the suits
would be heard in the federal district courts.
Wilson, a citizen who supports law enforcement,
brought suit in federal district court to challenge
the federal statute.

The Commonwealth of Newcastle has a vast coastal
shoreline. Each year thousands of boats are manu-
factured and sold in Newcastle. In light of its
expanded boat industry, Newcastle has passed a law
establishing a Department of Boating to oversee
and regulate boat sales within the state. In an insev-
erable provision, the Newcastle Boating Act also
prohibited any person from selling at retail any new
or used boat that has not been inspected and
approved for safety by a licensed boating inspection
station in Newcastle prior to the time the vendor
delivers possession to the purchaser. Despite
protests from boat manufacturers and dealers, the
Boating Act was passed by the Newcastle state
legislature and signed into law by the governor.

tracts that might require the
manufacturer to reimburse the retailers

In recent years, the city of Santa Ana has been
plagued by teenage gang violence. There have been
numerous incidents of sporadic shootings and stab-
bings involving gang members. Unfortunately, even
innocent bystanders have fallen victim to this gang
warfare. In an effort to alleviate the problem, the
city has opened a teenage discotheque where local
youths can mingle and dance while under adult
supervision. Only teenage boys and girls between
the ages of 13 to 19 are permitted to enter the club.

When the discotheque first opened, an unexpected
problem presented itself. There were a lot more
male teenagers frequenting the club than females.
This resulted in much harassment and fights which
only contributed to the girls staying away. In order
to try to correct this situation, the Santa Ana City
Council passed an ordinance that provided that any
male teenager desiring to enter the discotheque
must be accompanied by a female.

After this ordinance went into affect, Cody Cleaver,
an 18-year-old youth, was denied admission to the
discotheque because he came alone. He then filed
suit in federal court challenging the constitutional-
ity of the Santa Ana ordinance. Before his suit
came to trial, Cody got married. Also, a Santa Ana
city councilwoman has now indicated that she is
considering to propose a resolution repealing the
ordinance.

Congress was concerned about the growth of com-

were placed on the ability of plaintiffs to file suit in
a distant federal court against out-of-state website
operators who lack the financial resources to
answer suit in every state where an Internet user
might be located. After the hearings had ended, the
members of Congress agreed that the growth of the
Internet and availability of state courts for redress
of Internet grievances had rendered federal court
suits based on diversity of citizenship an unneces-
sary and dangerous impediment to the growth of
Internet commerce. Thus, the Congress, over the
veto of the President, enacted legislation which
completely barred all suits filed in federal court
based on diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.

During the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los
Angeles, Algerian terrorists captured the U.S. vol-
leyball team and threatened to kill them unless
President Reagan released three fellow Algerians
who were being held in prison in California. The
Algerians who were in prison had been prosecuted
and convicted in a California state court for kidnap-
ping. President Reagan realized that if the volley-
ball team was murdered it would destroy any
chance the United States had of winning a gold
medal in that competition. Under intense pressure
from the U.S. Olympic Committee, President
Reagan decided to make an exception to his inflexi-
ble stand on international terrorism. He issued a
presidential pardon for the Algerian prisoners and
ordered Governor Dukemejian to release them.
However, the governor refused to honor the
Presidential order.

7.	 Which of the following is the strongest consti-

tutional ground for the governor's refusal to
release the prisoners?

The President's power as Commander-
in-Chief does not extend to persons held
in state custody.
The President has the constitutional
power to grant pardons or reprieves only
for offenses against the United States.
Under intergovernmental immunity, the
governor acting pursuant to state laws
may disregard inconsistent orders by
federal officials.
The President's duty to take care that the

he honor all the terms of a state court
conviction.

President Clinton was a longtime admirer of
Crispus Attucks, one of the five men killed in the
Boston Massacre. As his last official act as presi-
dent, Clinton issued an executive order making
January 2nd, Crispus Attucks' birthday, as a paid
national holiday for federal executive employees.

Congressional legislation currently in effect desig-
nates ten paid national holidays for federal em-
ployees. The applicable federal law neither
authorizes nor prohibits the president's action.
Clinton's executive order extends only to members
of the executive branch of the federal government.

Faith Hall is a recent Harvard Law School graduate

Clinton's order does not extend to federal judicial
employees. Faith brings suit in federal court chal-
lenging the validity of the executive order.

The President was concerned about a possible trade
embargo imposed on U.S. exports to the country of
Blekarne because U.S. manufacturers operating in
Blekarne were paying wages to Blekarne workers at
a rate substantially lower than those paid to U.S.
workers performing comparable work. In order to
avoid this problem, the President entered into an
executive agreement with the leader of Blekarne
requiring that any U.S. based company employing
workers in Blekarne must pay those workers no
less than 80 percent as much as any U.S. worker
employed by the company in the U.S. performing
a similar function. Several U.S. manufacturers
complained that this would place them at a gross
disadvantage compared to non-U.S. based compa-
nies who did not have to increase their wages for
Blekarne workers. The U.S. manufacturers com-

The Florida legislature has passed a law banning
the sale of phen fen, a popular weight loss pill,
within the state due to widespread reports that
the drug caused users to suffer cardiac arrest. The
Florida statute prohibited the sale and distribution
of phen fen either by prescription or by over-the-
counter sales. Violation of the statute was pro-
scribed to be a misdemeanor punishable by a
$1,000 fine.

After the Florida law was enacted, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), a federal agency,
issued an administrative order allowing the sale of
phen fen by prescription only.

Eli Einhorn is a registered pharmacist who owns

The state of Oklahoma has passed a law requiring
all commercial restaurants to cook their beef and
hamburger meat at a minimum temperature of 165
degrees Fahrenheit. This law which became known
as the "E. Coli Prevention Act" went into effect
January 1, 2004. According to an inseverable provi-
sion of the law, Oklahoma health inspectors were
empowered to levy fines and/or revoke the business
permits of any restaurant failing to comply with the
health measure. The state legislature enacted this
law in order to ensure that beef was properly
cooked to kill the E. Coli bacteria. An E. Coli
bacteria epidemic has spread across Oklahoma
and various sections of the United States resulting
in many deaths to infant children. Health
authorities have attributed the E. Coli epidemic
to under-cooked beef mostly from fast food
restaurant chains.

In 2001, Congress passed a similar bill requiring all
commercial restaurants to cook their beef at a mini-
mum temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit. After
the Oklahoma law went into effect, a state health
inspector determined that Burp's Burger King

a food and drink concession in a federal park
located in the State of Cumberland. Reeves oper-

sion was operated in federally-owned facilities, for
which Reeves paid rent, and served visiting tourists
from all over the country.

The legislature of the State of Cumberland, in an

imposing a rental use tax on all persons occupying
real property in Cumberland for which no state real
property taxes are paid. Pursuant to the new law,
the Cumberland Department of Revenue attempted

the federal facilities housing his operation. Reeves
sued in federal district court to invalidate the state
rental use tax as applied to him.

In order to resolve a longstanding territorial dispute
with the Poco Indians, Congress enacted a statute
conveying 1,000 acres of federal land in southeast
Idaho to the Indian tribe. The statute provided that
the land in question would be sold to the Poco tribe
for the price of $1.00. After enactment of this
statute was made public, many other Indian tribes
protested the government's action. In particular, the
Aloquonquin Indian tribe, who claimed title to a
large tract of federal land in northern Michigan,
was angered because no similar land conveyance
was made to them.

16. The Aloquonquin Indian tribe brought suit in
an appropriate federal district court challeng-
ing the constitutionality of this federal statute.
Assuming that the Aloquonquin tribe has ade-
quate standing, which of the following state-
ments concerning this suit is most accurate?

(A) The court should treat the action of

Congress as presumptively valid because
the Constitution expressly gives
Congress power to dispose of the terri-
tory or other property belonging to the
United States.

(B) The court should treat the action of

Congress as presumptively invalid
because $1.00 consideration is wholly
inadequate to compensate the govern-
ment for the conveyance of such a large
tract of land.

(C) The court should hold this statute to be

constitutional only if substantial evi-
dence demonstrates that the Poco Indian
tribe did, in fact, have a valid claim to
the land in question.

unconstitutional because it denies other
Indian tribes the equal protection of the

good for the purchase of various consumer goods at
special state retail outlets. In practice, one Midwest
Buck is slightly greater in buying power than one
dollar, since the special state retail stores are
exempted from paying state retail sales tax. A sig-
nificant commerce in Midwest Bucks has sprung
up independent of the state retail stores, since many
people are willing to accept Midwest Bucks in
exchange for services or property knowing that they
can use them to purchase goods at the state stores.
The United States government has instituted an
action in federal court to declare the Midwest
Bucks legislation unconstitutional.

17. Which of the following is the strongest argu-

ment supporting a judicial declaration that the
challenged statute is unconstitutional?

(A) The statute unduly burdens commerce.
(B) The statute violates the Privileges and
Immunities Clause of Article IV.

(C) The statute is inconsistent with the

express power of the federal government
to coin money and regulate its value.

(D) The authority to tax, and the concomi-

tant authority to issue tax refunds in any
legitimate manner, is inherent in the
powers reserved to the states by the
Tenth Amendment.

A state university adopts a policy prohibiting the
admission of any student who is a citizen of a
country in which United States citizens have been
held as hostages in the last five years. Fouad is
denied admission to the university because he is a
citizen of Iraq, a nation where several Americans
are being held hostage.

18. Which of the following is the strongest argu-

ment with which to attack the constitutionality
of this policy?

The state university policy conflicts with
the negative implications flowing from
the federal government's authority over
foreign relations.
Denial of admission to these foreigners
for such past actions of their govern-
ments is an ex post facto law.
Admission to a university is so impor-
tant to a person's economic prospects
that it is considered a property interest
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Admission to a state university is a priv-
ilege and immunity protected against
state infringement by the Fourteenth
Amendment.

Question 19 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 20 is based on the following fact situation.

In September, Hurricane Helga struck the Florida
coast with devastating force. Helga was a grade 5
hurricane and caused over $100,000,000 in dam-
ages. Florida farmers were especially hit hard by
the hurricane which destroyed over 30% of the
state's citrus crops. As a consequence, Congress
passed an emergency farm aid bill providing
$50,000,000 in subsidies to Florida orange growers
to compensate them for their economic losses.

Clearly, Florida's economy is very much dependent
upon the orange industry, which is its largest staple
crop. The federal farm aid bill, however, did not
provide any compensation to Florida farmers grow-
ing crops other than oranges.

19. Pappas is a Florida papaya farmer who suf-

fered substantial economic loss when his
entire crop was destroyed by Hurricane Helga.
Pappas challenges the constitutionality of the
aforementioned federal law. Is this act of
Congress constitutional?

Yes, because Congress has exclusive
jurisdiction as to the propriety of dis-
persing federal funds which is not sub-
ject to judicial review.
Yes, because Congress has the power to
appropriate funds for the general welfare
even though disparate treatment is given
to different groups.
No, because the law violates the equal
protection rights of farmers of products
other than oranges who are not entitled
to governmental subsidies.
No, because the law denies farmers of
products other than oranges their funda-
mental rights without due process.

Congress was concerned about the privacy of
Internet communication and banking transactions
conducted at automated teller machines (ATMs). In
order to increase the protections afforded these
electronic transactions and communications,
Congress passed the Cyberspace Privacy Act
(CPA). Under the CPA, all encryption technology
(encryption is the process by which a computer pro-
gram changes readable text information into an
unreadable algorithm or mathematical equation)
used to secure Internet and ATM transactions was
subject to federal regulation. The CPA strictly regu-
lated the development, use and sale of all encryp-
tion software.

One provision of the CPA expressly empowered the
Office of Defense Trade Controls (ODTC), a fed-
eral agency, to regulate the import and export of all
encryption technology with foreign countries.
Accordingly, the ODTC was given authority to pro-
hibit the export of any encryption system of soft-
ware if, in the judgment of the ODTC, the export
would threaten national security or other foreign
policy interests.

Professor Gates, a recognized expert on
Management Information Systems (MIS), has
developed an encryption software program that he
was negotiating to sell to a company in France. The
ODTC has refused to issue an authorization approv-
ing the sale of Professor Gates' encryption software
to the French company.

20. Professor Gates filed suit in federal district
court challenging the constitutionality of the
Cyberspace Privacy Act. The legislation is

(A)

(B)

constitutional, under the Commerce
Clause
constitutional, because Congress has the
power to regulate for the general welfare

(C) unconstitutional, because it deprives

Professor Gates of a property right with-
out just compensation

(D) unconstitutional, because it usurps the
power of the executive branch to con-
duct foreign affairs

Question 21 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 22 is based on the following fact situation.

Congress was very concerned about the rise in gun-
related deaths and injuries that had been occurring
in the schools. To combat the problem, Congress
passed a statute which required the states to enact
legislation that made it a crime to sell, possess, or
transport any firearm within 100 yards of any
school if that firearm had been purchased or sold
through or using any instrumentality of interstate
commerce.

21. Is the statute constitutional?

(A) Yes, because the statute will permit a

case-by-case review of the adequacy of
an interstate commerce connection
between the permissible objectives of
the federal statute and any individual
criminal prosecution.

(B) Yes, because the statute is a proper

attempt to regulate interstate commerce
in its inseverable aggregates.

(C) No, under the separation of powers doc-
trine, Congress cannot commandeer the
states to enact and enforce legislation.
(D) No, the connection between interstate

commerce and the purpose of the regu-
lation is too remote to justify the exer-
cise of the Commerce Clause power.

The state of North Durango enacted a statute
prohibiting any motor vehicles traveling within the
state to have Windowtinting or glass coating of any
kind. The bill, known as the "Window Tint" Act,
passed the state legislature at the urging of state and
local law enforcement agencies who argued that
tinted windows prevented them from observing
interior car activity. Most citizens also supported
the "Window Tint" Act, especially after a North
Durango state trooper was gunned down and killed
by an occupant in a window tinted limousine. The
trooper was unable to see that his assailant was
armed and dangerous when he approached the
vehicle for a speeding infraction.

Luxury Limousine Company operates a limo
service in the neighboring state of South Durango.
Luxury has a fleet of 68 limos all of which have
tinted windows. Each year Luxury makes thousands
of trips into North Durango to transport passengers
to Durango International Airport (situated ten miles
from the South Durango border) and other destina-
tions. Since all its limos are manufactured with
tinted windows, Luxury will incur a great expense
to specially order limos without tinting.

22. Luxury brings suit to challenge the constitu-

tionality of the North Durango "Window Tint"
Act. Assuming that Luxury has proper stand-
ing to assert such an action, which of the
following is Luxury's strongest constitutional
argument to invalidate the aforesaid statute?

(A) Because window tinting is permitted on

vehicles in neighboring states, this law
denies Luxury the equal protection of
laws whenever its limos operate within
North Durango.

(B) Because this law burdens interstate com-

merce by prohibiting all vehicles with
window tinting from entering the state,
this law violates the Commerce Clause.
(C) Because window tinting on vehicles is

legal in South Durango but illegal in
North Durango, this law violates the
Contract Clause by preventing Luxury
from fulfilling its obligation to transport
passengers into North Durango.

(D) Because interstate travel is a fundamental

right that may not be burdened by state
law, it violates Luxury's substantive due
process rights by arbitrarily and unrea-
sonably regulating economic activity.

Question 23 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 24 is based on the following fact situation.

The state of Rutherford is known for its coal pro-
duction. The neighboring state of Chippewa also
contains large coal deposits. Chippewa's main coal
mining company, however, is in poor financial
shape, and there are rumors in the industry that it
may cease doing business and sell a large quantity
of coal at bargain prices.

Fearful of an impending glut on the market and the
consequent effect on the local coal industry, the
Rutherford state legislature enacts a law which pro-
hibits sales of coal within the Rutherford state
boundaries at less than $25/ton, which is the cur-
rent market price.

23. This law is most likely to be held constitu-
tional as applied to which of the following
coal vendors?

A Chippewa vendor offering coal for
sale to the general public in the state of
Rutherford at $20/ton.
A Rutherford vendor offering coal for
sale to the U.S. Veteran's Hospital in
Rutherford at $20/ton.
A Rutherford vendor offering coal for
sale to a manufacturing plant in
Rutherford at $20/ton.
A vendor located outside of the United
States offering coal for sale to the gen-
eral public in the state of Rutherford for
$20/ton.

Tish, an avid sports fan, lived in Honolulu.
Recently, Select Television, a privately owned and
operated company, applied for a permit to provide
cable television service to residents of the city. By a
vote of 9 to 3, the Honolulu City Council approved
Select Television's application and granted a permit
for a city franchise. Thereafter, Tish subscribed
with Select which then installed cable service to
Tish's home. Tish subscribed with Select because it
offered a wide range of sports programs from all
across the country.

Select installed cable service at Tish's home in
February. For the next four months, Tish promptly
paid the $25 monthly charge for the cable service.
In July, however, Tish was fired from his job as a
sushi chef at Benihana Restaurant. Unable to find
any work and short of cash, Tish failed to pay
Select's bill for the months of July and August.

On August 31, Select removed its cable television
lines to Tish's home. At no time did Select notify
Tish that it would be disconnecting service.
However, unknown to Tish it was Select's policy to
terminate service to any customer who failed to pay
his or her bill for two consecutive months.

A short time later, Tish brought suit against Select
in federal court seeking an order restoring his cable
service. Tish's suit was based solely on the ground
that Select's failure to grant Tish a hearing before
disconnecting his cable service violated his due
process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.

24. Based on the given facts, the federal court

should rule in favor of

(B)

(A) Select, because the ownership of a city
franchise is not sufficient state action to
make the franchisee subject to the
Fourteenth Amendment
Select, because the ownership of a city
franchise allows the franchisee to assert
successfully the city's sovereign immu-
nity under the Eleventh Amendment
(C) Tish, because under the Fourteenth

Amendment a person may not be
deprived of a valuable property right
without notice or an opportunity for a
hearing

(D) Tish, because a business operating under
a city franchise is effectively within the
public interest, and therefore it is subject
to constitutional requirements of proce-
dural due process

Question 25 is based on the following fact situation.

Question 26 is based on the following fact situation.

Paul recently left his job in Wildwood, a rural
community in the State of Calzona, and moved his
family to Industria in search of new career opportu-
nities there. Industria is located in an urbanized
metropolitan area of Calzona which has been expe-
riencing tremendous employment and residential
growth of late. When Paul informed his insurance
carrier, Good Neighbor Insurance Company, of the
change of residence, he was notified that his auto
and home insurance rates would increase by 300
percent due to the large number of traffic accidents
and theft claims occurring in Industria. The insur-
ance industry is highly regulated by Calzona law,
including the licensing and solvency of all insur-
ance companies operating within the state. There
are no state laws regulating the rates for insurance
practices of the companies.

25. If Paul brings suit in a Calzona state court

claiming the rate increase is discriminatory in
violation of the Equal Protection Clause and
the court rules against him, the most likely
reason will be because

(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

states have plenary power to regulate the
insurance industry within their own state
boundaries
there is a valid reason to discriminate
the Equal Protection Clause is not
applicable
the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied

Recent evidence reported in leading medical jour-
nals suggests that hearing loss affects 75 percent of
citizens over the age of 70. The legislature of the
State of Watusi, concerned with increasing the
quality of care to its senior citizens, passes a bill
providing that on or after January 1, 2007, only
medical doctors with specialized training in audiol-
ogy may prescribe and sell hearing aids. The law
provides a "grandfather clause" however, exempting
all currently registered vendors of hearing aids who
have no medical training, so long as they remain in
business.

26. Frank Fearless, an M.D. who operates a hear-
ing clinic, brings suit challenging the grandfa-
ther clause exemption in the new statute. The
exemption in the law for all currently regis-
tered vendors of hearing aids will probably be
found to be

constitutional, because the classification
between existing and new vendors has a
rational basis
constitutional, because those who law-
fully engage in an occupation have a
fundamental right to continue to do so
unconstitutional, because the statute
denies the equal protection of the laws
to those patients who purchase hearing
aids from non-physicians
unconstitutional, because the statute
denies non-physicians desiring to enter
this occupation the equal protection of
the laws

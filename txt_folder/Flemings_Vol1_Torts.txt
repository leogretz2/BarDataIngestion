A. Rhonda will have no cause of
action for common law deceit,
since the element of a false state 
ment of fact has not been met.

B. Rhonda will have no cause of
action, since she should have
taken the car to a mechanic who
could have discovered the defect.

C. Rhonda will have a cause of ac 
tion, since active concealment
constitutes common law deceit.

D. Rhonda will not have a cause of
action for deceit because of the
"as is" clause.

Questions 8 - 9 are based on the
following facts:

Rhonda went to Clay's Cars to purchase a
used car. Clay's salesman, Harry, showed
Rhonda a 1985 Crevet. Harry stated that the
Crevet was "a honey of a car, a one of a kind
steal for the money." Rhonda relied on
Harry's statements and purchased the vehicle
from Clay's Cars "as is." The Crevet's en 
gine failed soon after Rhonda purchased it.

47. Al was hit by an automobile negligently
driven by Robert. Al was immediately
taken to the hospital for treatment. At
the hospital, he developed severe un-
controlled internal bleeding, as a result
of pre-existing hemophilia. He died the
next day from the bleeding. What ef-
fect will AI's pre-existing hemophilia
have on recovery of his estate's recov-
ery of damages?

A. Robert is liable for all damages
resulting from his negligent con-
duct.

B. AI's hemophilia is an interven-
ing independent cause of death,
therefore Robert is only respon-
sible for those damages that
would had occurred ifAl was not
a hemophiliac.

C. AI's estate will not recover any

damages from Robert.

D. None of the above.

A. Strict liability.

B. Battery.

C. Negligence.

D. Breach of warranty.

49. Sam, a large 6'2" man, was at a sports
bar watching the USC Trojans pummel
the UCLA Bruins. Sam was excitedly
cheering as USC completed another
touchdown. George, a wee bit of a man
who was a Bruin fan, became enraged
at Sam's exuberance. George raised his
fist and shouted to Sam, "If you weren't
such a large pig, I would knock you
down." Sam brings a suit against
George for assault. Sam will most
likely:

A. Win, since he felt apprehension
when George was shaking his fist
at him.

B. Win, since George was shaking

his fist.

Questions 51 - 54 are based on the
following facts:

C. Lose, since in light of George's
statement, his conduct was not
sufficient to create immediate ap 
prehension in Sam.

D. Lose, because George is not big

enough to assault Sam.

the animal was the neighbor's dog Spot.
Which of the following propositions is
most correct?

A. Neighbor will have a cause of
action for trespass to chattel.

B. Bob will not be liable to neigh 
bor because he made a reason 
able mistake.

C. Neighbor will have a cause of

action for battery.

D. Bob will be found guilty of cru

Marvin was dissatisfied with his facial fea 
tures, especially the large "bags" under his
eyes. He finally decided to consider elec 
tive plastic surgery. Marvin visited the of 
fice of Doctor, a certified licensed plastic
surgeon. Doctor advised Marvin that if he
surgically removed the bags, Marvin would
"look years younger." Marvin agreed to un 
dergo the surgery, at Doctor's office as an
out-patient.

Doctor administered a general anesthetic and
performed the surgery around Marvin's eyes.
While Marvin was still unconscious, Doc 
tor decided to remove a mole on Marvin's
chin that Doctor thought was unsightly.
When Marvin awoke, he found that he had
no sensation on the left side of his face. He
was also upset to learn that Doctor had re 
moved the mole.

51.

If Marvin sues Doctor for removing the
mole:

A. Marvin will not recover, so long
as Doctor performed the surgery
as would a reasonable, prudent
plastic surgeon.

B. Marvin will not recover because
he impliedly consented to
Doctor's removal of the mole.

C. Marvin will recover because
Doctor has committed the tort of
battery.

D. Marvin will recover because

Doctor was negligent.

52. If Marvin contends that Doctor was re 
sponsible for Marvin's loss of sensation
in his face, the likely outcome will be:

A. Marvin will recover, if he can
show that Doctor had exclusive
control of his person during the
surgery and that the injury suf 
fered usually would not occur in
the absence of negligence.

B. Marvin will recover because a
surgeon is always responsible for
a patient's injuries during sur 
gery.

C. Marvin will not recover, unless
a percipient witness testifies that
Doctor's negligence was the
cause in fact of the injury.

D. None of the above.

53. The standard of care that the court
should apply in Marvin's negligence
action against Doctor is that of:

A. The reasonable, prudent physi 

cian.

B. The reasonable, prudent plastic
surgeon in Doctor's locality.

C. The reasonable, prudent plastic
surgeon as determined by na 
tional standards.

D. The reasonable, prudent plastic
surgeon with education and ex 
perience similar to Doctor's.

54. Assume, for purposes of this question
only, that Marvin's loss of sensation in
his face resulted from the operation
around his eyes, but that Doctor was not
negligent in performing the surgery. In
a suit by Marvin against Doctor:

A. Marvin will recover because a
surgeon is responsible for all in 
juries a patient sustains during an
operation.

B. Marvin will recover under a neg 
ligence theory, if Doctor failed
to inform him that loss of facial
sensation is a common side ef 
fect of surgery around the eyes.

C. Marvin will recover because of
the rule of post hoc ergo propter
hoc.

D. Marvin will not recover.

Questions 55 - 57 are based on the
following facts:

Nancy owns a collection agency. She prides
herself on collecting debts where other col 
lection agencies have failed. Nancy at 
tempted to collect a debt that Darren owed
one of her clients. She made numerous tele 
phone calls to Darren's home between the
hours of 11:00 P.M. and 6:00 AM., to in 
duce him to pay the debt. She continued this
practice for over two months. Finally, Nancy
visited Darren's home and told him in the
presence of his wife, Anne, that Darren
would suffer "serious consequences to his
health" if he did not pay the debt within 24
hours. Darren paid the debt later that day.

Darren and Anne claim that Nancy's collec 
tion tactics caused them serious emotional
disturbance. Both are being treated by psy 
chologists and wish to recover from Nancy
for their mental distress and doctor bills.

55. Darren is most likely to recover from
Nancy for his injuries under which of
the following theories:

A Intentional infliction of emo 

A Anne will not recover because
Nancy had no intent to cause her
emotional distress.

B. Anne will recover because the
doctrine of transferred intent ap 
plies.

c. Anne will not recover because
she has not suffered pecuniary
loss.

D. Anne will recover, if she can
show that Nancy should have
reasonably foreseen that Anne
would suffer emotional distress.

57. To recover for intentional infliction of
emotional distress, most jurisdictions
require a plaintiff to prove, in addition
to an intentional and outrageous act, that
the act has caused:

A Plaintiff a physical impact that
caused the emotional distress.

B. Plaintiff physical consequences
from the emotional distress.

Questions 58 - 60 are based on the
following facts:

D. Sets the duty of care under the
theory of res ipsa loquitur.

Nellie operates a restaurant in a part of the
city that is notorious as a high-crime area.
The restaurant opens every day at 11 :00
AM. and closes at midnight. Customers park
their automobiles in a lot, which Nellie owns,
that is adjacent to the restaurant. A city ordi 
nance requires that each restaurant owner
maintain a parking facility that "is continu 
ously lighted for the hours beginning with
dusk and ending one hour after said restau 
rant has closed for business."

One evening, Nellie's parking lot lighting
system malfunctioned and failed to operate.
Otis, a customer, was beaten and robbed in
the lot by an unknown assailant at 10:00 P.M.
This was the first time that anyone had been
the victim of a crime in the lot. The same
evening, Willard, an intoxicated customer,
fainted in the parking lot and struck his head
on a parking space divider that was not vis 
ible in the darkness.

58. If Otis and Willard sue Nellie for negli 
gence, the judge should instruct the jury
that the city ordinance:

A Establishes the duty of care.

B.

Is a factor that the jury can ac 
cept or reject when it determines
the duty of care.

C.

Is of no relevance in establish 
ing the duty of care.

59. Assume, for this question, that Nellie
breached her duty of care by failing to
keep the parking lot lighted. If Otis sues
Nellie in negligence for injuries caused
by the robber:

A Nellie should prevail because the
intentional act of a felon is al 
ways a superseding cause.

B . Nellie should prevail because no
one had ever been beaten or
robbed in her parking lot before.

C. Otis should prevail if, given the
fact that Nellie's establishment is
in a high-crime area, he can
prove that it was reasonably fore 
seeable that he might be robbed
in the unlighted parking lot.

D. Otis should prevail because the
owner of a restaurant owes a
higher duty of care to a patron
that results in strict liability.

60. Assume, for this question, that Nellie
breached her duty of care by failing to
keep the parking lot lighted. If Willard
sues Nellie for injuries he suffered in
his fall:

A Willard will prevail, because
Nellie was negligent per se.

lQiIS III

B. Willard will prevail because his
fall was a reasonably foreseeable
result of Nellie's negligence.

C. Nellie will prevail because her
breach of the duty of care was
not the cause in fact of Willard's
injury.

D. Nellie will prevail because
Willard had the last clear chance
of preventing the injury.

Questions 61 - 63 are based on the
following facts:

Irene was a passenger in Hank's automobile.
As Hank drove the car through the moun 
tains, a heavy snow storm suddenly came
up. Hank, who was driving too fast for the
conditions, failed to see a tractor trailer that
was blocking the road. Trucker, the owner
of the tractor trailer, had stopped his vehicle
to install snow chains, but had carelessly
failed to pull off the road. Hank was unable
to stop his car and it struck the tractor trailer.
Irene was injured in the accident.

61.

IfIrene sues Hank and Trucker in neg 
ligence to recover damages for her in 
juries:

A. Irene will recover only those
damages which she can prove
each defendant caused.

B. Hank and Trucker will each be
liable to Irene for the full amount
of her damages.

C. Hank and Trucker will each be
liable for fifty percent of Irene's
damages.

D. Irene will recover nothing be 
cause she assumed the risk.

62. Assume, for this question, that a jury
determined that Hank and Trucker were
both responsible for Irene's damages
and that Hank paid Irene the full
amount. Hank's best recourse against
Trucker would be under the theory of:

ElUilS

A. Satisfaction.

B.

Indemnification.

C. Release.

D. Contribution.

63. Assume, for this question, that Hank's
negligence was the sole cause of the
accident and that the jurisdiction has an
automobile guest statute. If Irene sues
Hank for damages:

A. Irene will recover because Hank

was negligent.

Questions 64 - 65 are based on the
following facts:

Paul was a member of a professional base 
ball team that was involved in a heated com 
petition for the league championship. His
team was playing its arch rival in an impor 
tant late-season game. With his team down
by one run with one out in the final inning,
Paul was on first base. When a ground ball
was hit to the second baseman, Paul decided
he would "break up" a potential double play
by making a hard, but legal, slide into Tom,
the shortstop. Paul prevented the double
play, but also broke Tom's ankle in the pro 
cess.

B.

C.

Irene will recover only if she can
show Hank's conduct amounted
to gross negligence.

64.

If Tom sues Paul for the injury to his
ankle, his most likely cause of action
will be for:

Irene will recover only if she can
show Hank's conduct amounted
to an intentional act.

A. Assault.

B. Battery.

D. Irene will recover nothing.

C.

Intentional infliction of emo 
tional distress.

D. Strict liability.

65. Paul's best defense to Tom's suit for

injury to his ankle would be:

A. Contributory negligence.

B. Justification.

C.

Implied consent.

D. Private necessity.

Questions 66 - 69 are based on the
following facts:

Scott owns a furniture store in the town of
Smallville. Scott advertises his location by
means of a large neon sign attached to the
building. The sign, which extends out over
a public sidewalk approximately 15 feet
from the ground, is anchored by two large
cables.

Scott had not checked the condition of the
cables in years, so he was unaware that they
were severely corroded. During an unusu 
ally violent windstorm, the cables broke and
the sign fell, striking Pam, a pedestrian. Pam,
who suffers from a rare bone disease, suf 
fered injuries much more severe than would
the average person when the sign struck her.

66. At common law, most courts would

classify Pam as:

A. A trespasser.

B. A licensee.

C. An invitee.

D. None of the above.

67. If Pam sues Scott in negligence for her
injuries, a court will likely find that
Scott:

A. Had a duty of care to keep the

cables in good repair.

B. Had a duty of care to warn Pam
only of known, latent defects.

C. Had a duty of care to warn Pam
only of dangerous active opera 
tions on his property.

D. Had no duty of care to Pam.

68. The effect of the unusually violent
windstorm on Pam's negligence suit
will likely be to:

A. Prevent Pam from recovering
from Scott, because the storm
was an intervening act of God.

B. Prevent Pam from recovering
from Scott, because a violent
storm is not a reasonably fore 
seeable event.

C. Not adversely affect Pam's suit,
as a defendant is liable for all
injuries directly caused by him.

D. Not adversely affect Pam's suit,
because the storm was a reason 
ably foreseeable intervening act
of God.

69. Assume, for this question, that Scott's
negligence caused the sign to strike
Pam. Pam will be able to recover:

A. Only those damages which Scott
could have reasonably foreseen
under the circumstances.

B. Only those damages which an
ordinary person would have suf-
fered, because Scott is not re-
sponsible for Pam's preexisting
condition.

C. All damages sustained in the ac-
cident, even though Pam has a
rare bone disease that makes her
more susceptible to injury.

D. None of the above.

Questions 70 — 74 are based on the
following facts:

Grover, a civilian employee of the United
States Army, was responsible for delivering
packages between military bases. He drove
a small government-owned van when mak-
ing his deliveries. One day, Grover was driv-
ing on a public highway and, because he was
careless, he lost control of the van. The ve-
hicle jumped the curb and struck Inge, a pe-
destrian.   

Inge was seriously injured in the accident.
She lingered in the hospital for almost two
months before she died of her injuries. Inge
is survived by her husband and two minor
children.

70. At common law, if Inge's estate sued
Grover to recover for medical expenses
incurred between the date of the acci-
dent and the date of her death, the re-
sult would be:

A. Inge's estate would recover
medical expenses in a wrongful
death action.

B. Inge's estate would recover
medical expenses in a survival
action.

C. Inge's estate would recover noth-
ing because her right of action
against Grover ended with her
death.

D. None of the above.

TaTTS 245

    
71.

In most states today, ifInge's husband
and minor children wish to recover for
lost financial support, services, and so 
ciety suffered as a result of her death,
their claim against Grover will be:

B. Grover's actions were a super 

seding cause.

C. Grover was engaged in a frolic

and detour.

A. A wrongful death action.

D. The Army's duty was non 

delegable.

B. A survival action.

C. A negligent infliction of emo 

tional distress action.

D. A simple negligence action.

74. Assume, for this question, that Grover
was negligent and that the Army was
vicariously liable. If the Army raises the
defense of sovereign immunity, the re 
sult will be:

A. The Army will be liable because
sovereign immunity violates the
Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.

B. The Army will be liable because
Congress waived sovereign im 
munity in negligence cases
through the Federal Tort Claims
Act.

C. The Army will be liable because
agencies of the United States
government have never enjoyed
sovereign immunity.

D. The Army will not be liable.

72. Assume, for this question, that Inge's
husband and children have a valid neg 
ligence claim against Grover. If they
wish to hold the Army responsible for
Grover's negligence, they should raise
the doctrine of:

A. Negligent hiring.

B. Respondeat superior.

C. Nondelegable duty.

D. Independent contractor.

73. Assume, for this question, that, at the
time of the accident, Grover was on a
personal errand totally unrelated to
Army business. If Inge's husband and
children sue the Army for Grover's neg 
ligence, the Army's best defense will
be:

A. Grover was acting within the

scope of his employment.

Questions 75 - 77 are based on the
following facts:

The Smalltown Sentinel is a local weekly
newspaper. Each issue includes a column
detailing births, deaths, marriages and other
events of interest in the community. In a re 
cent issue, the Sentinel ran an item stating:
"Local resident Sally Smith, age 21, gave
birth to twins last week." There is one
Smalltown resident named Sally Smith and
she is 21, but she is not married and has never
had a child. Smith suffered ridicule and
embarrassment because of the news item.
When informed of its mistake, the Sentinel
printed a retraction and apology.

75. At common law, if Sally Smith sued the
Sentinel for libel based on the news
item:

A. She would recover because the

statement is libel per se.

B. She would not recover because
there has been no publication.

A. Her suit would fail because libel
required malicious intent at com 
mon law.

B. Her suit would fail because libel
required at least reckless conduct
at common law.

C. Her suit would fail because libel
required at least negligence at
common law.

D. Her suit would succeed.

77. Assume, for this question, that Sally
Smith has proven a prima facie case for
libel. The effect of the Sentinel's retrac 
tion and apology would be:

A. To limit damages the Sentinel
must pay, because of the mitiga 
tion rule.

B. To limit damages the Sentinel
must pay, because of the collat 
eral source rule.

C. She would not recover because
she has not established the col 
loquium.

C. To limit damages the Sentinel
must pay, because of the offset 
ting benefit rule.

D. She would recover, so long as
she produced sufficient evidence
to show reasonable innuendo.

D. To prevent Sally Smith from re 
covering any damages from the
Sentinel.

Questions 78 - 81 are based on the
following facts:

79. If Linda brings a defamation action

against Cleo, the result will be:

Roman is the host of a nationally-syndicated
radio show. Roman is very controversial and
specializes in exposing unsavory details
about the lives of politicians and celebrities.
Roman decided to exploit his notoriety by
marketing a series of cassette tapes entitled,
"Lifestyles of the Sick and Sleazy." The in 
formation on the tapes had never been re 
vealed or published before. The tapes were
distributed to bookstores nationwide for sale.
Cleo, a bookseller, sold a number of the tapes
but never listened to them himself.

On one of the tapes, Roman alleged that
Linda, a United States Senator, had worked
as a dancer in a topless bar while in college.
Roman heard this "rumor" from an
ex-convict with a very poor reputation for
the truth, but he did no further investigation
before recording the story. In fact, the story
was a complete fabrication. Linda, a very
conservative individual, was distressed and
embarrassed when she learned of the story.

78. Modernly, if Linda sues Roman for
defamation, the most appropriate cause
of action would be:

A. Slander.

B. Libel.

C. Slander per se.

D. Libel per quod.

If Linda sues Roman for libel, the rul-
ings of the United States Supreme Court
require that she must prove:

A. "Actual malice," meaning that
Roman acted willfully and wan-
tonly in publishing the de-

B. "Actual malice," meaning that
Roman acted with knowledge
that the defamatory statement
was false or with reckless disre-
gard for the truth.

C. Roman was at least negligent and
she suffered "actual injury."

D. Roman intended to make the

defamatory statement.

8!. Under rulings of the United States Su-

in her libel action against Roman is:

A. Preponderance of the evidence.

B. Clear and convincing evidence.

C. Beyond a reasonable doubt.

D. None of the above.

Questions 82 — 85 are based on the
following facts:

Harriet and Jenny were once general part-
ners in the same law firm. Harriet and Jenny
had numerous disagreements which led them
to dissolve the firm. After the breakup,
Harriet learned that Jenny was telling other
lawyers that Harriet was facing disciplinary
action by the state bar for commingling cli-
ent trust fund monies with her personal as-
sets. This allegation was untrue in all re-
spects. She also learned that Jenny told other
acquaintances that Harriet "was a real clown,
who wouldn't recognize a lawbook if one
fell on her head."   

82. At common law, if Harriet sues Jenny
for defamation with respect to the state-
ments about commingling client trust
funds, the appropriate cause of action
would be:

A. Slander per se.

B. Slander per quod.

C. Simple slander.

D. Intentional interference with pro-
spective business advantage.

a courtroom spectator, heard Jenny's
false statement on the witness stand.
When Aaron returned to his office, he
repeated Jenny's statements to Clyde,
a co-worker, but Clyde did not believe
the statement. If Harriet sues Aaron for
defamation, the result will be:

A. Aaron will prevail because he is
protected by the reporter's privi 
lege.

B. Harriet will prevail because
Aaron has republished the de 
famatory statement.

C. Harriet will prevail because
Aaron has exceeded the scope of
his conditional privilege.

D. Aaron will prevail because Clyde
did not believe the statement.

A. Harriet will not recover because
the statement is Jenny's opinion
and all opinions are constitution 
ally protected under the Gertz v.
Welch decision.

B. Harriet will not recover because
lawyers are always public figures
under New York Times v.
Sullivan.

C. Harriet will not recover because
Jenny's statement is an opinion
that does not appear to be
founded on underlying false
facts.

D. Harriet will recover.

84. Assume, for this question, that Harriet
sued Jenny for defamation and that dur

Jenny for defamation for the in-court
false statement, Jenny's best defense
will be:

A. Harriet assumed the risk of the
in-court statement when she filed
the first suit.

Questions 86 - 88 are based on the
following facts:

Snowco is a manufacturer of snowmobiles.
Ski-Fun, an independent retailer, sells a num 
ber of snowmobiles from Snowco's line.
Marlene purchased a Snowco snowmobile
from Ski-Fun. The very first time she oper 
ated the vehicle, the steering mechanism
malfunctioned, causing the snowmobile to
overturn. The snowmobile struck Harold, a
bystander. Marlene and Harold both suffered
serious injuries. Accident investigators de 
termined that a critical bolt in the steering
mechanism was missing and that the acci 
dent resulted from this defect.

86.

If Marlene sues Snowco for injuries
suffered in the accident, the likely re 
sult will be:

A. Marlene will not recover because
she is not in privity of contract
with Snowco.

B. Marlene will not recover, unless
she can prove Snowco was neg 
ligent.

C. Marlene will recover, under a
strict liability in tort theory, be 
cause Snowco is responsible for
the design defect.

D. Marlene will recover, under a
strict liability in tort theory, be 
cause Snowco is responsible for
the manufacturing defect.

87. Assume, for this question, that Ski-Fun
did not inspect the snowmobile's steer 
ing mechanism before it sold the vehicle
to Marlene. If Harold sues Ski-Fun for
his injuries under a strict liability in tort
theory, in most jurisdictions today:

A. Harold will not recover because
Ski-Fun did not cause the manu 
facturing defect.

B. Harold will recover, so long as
he was a reasonably foreseeable
bystander.

C. Harold will not recover because
in privity with

he was not
Ski-Fun or Snowco.

D. Harold will recover, but only if
he was related to Marlene.

88. Which of the following statements
would constitute Snowco's best defense
to a strict liability in tort action by
Marlene?

A. The evidence

shows

that
Marlene tampered with the steer 
ing mechanism before she drove
the snowmobile.

B. A snowmobile is an inherently
dangerous instrument, and
Marlene assumed the risk when
she operated it.

C. Marlene had never driven a
snowmobile before the accident.

D. In the snowmobile industry,
Snowco has the most elaborate
quality control checks during the

Questions 89 - 90 are based on the
following facts:

Moribundia is a rare tropical disease that
causes death to 98% of humans who con 
tract it. There has been no known cure for
the disease. Recently, Pharmco developed a
new drug to counteract Moribundia. Labo 
ratory tests revealed, however, that a side
effect of the drug is deafness in 1% of pa 
tients who were treated with the medication.
Despite diligent efforts, Pharmo's scientists
have been unable to eliminate the deafness
side effect associated with the drug. Elmer
contracted Moribundia and his physician
prescribed Pharmco's new drug. While the
drug saved Elmer's life, it also left him pro 
foundly deaf.

89. If Elmer sues Pharmco under a strict
liability in tort theory for his deafness,
the likely result will be:

A. Elmer will recover because
Pharmco is responsible for the
manufacturing defect.

B. Elmer will recover because
Pharmco is responsible for the
design defect.

C. Elmer will not recover because
the drug was unavoidably un 
safe.

D. Elmer will not recover because
drug manufacturers are exempt
from strict liability rules.

Ell lU'IlS

90. Assume,

for

this question,

that
Pharmco's new drug is available only
by prescription and that the package
contains a conspicuous warning of the
possible deafness side-effect. Assume,
also, that Elmer's doctor administered
the drug, but that he failed to tell Elmer
of the risk of deafness. If Elmer sues
Pharmco under a strict liability in tort
theory for his deafness, the result will
be:

A. Elmer will recover because
Pharmco failed to warn him of
the deafness side effect.

B. Elmer will recover because
Pharmco is responsible for all
personal injuries caused by its
drug.

C. Elmer will not recover because
Pharmco's warning to Elmer's
doctor constitutes a warning to
Elmer.

D. Elmer will not recover because
drug manufacturers are exempt
from strict liability rules.

Questions 91 - 92 are based on the
following facts:

Blaster Co. is a manufacturer of dynamite,
nitroglycerin and other volatile products.
The management at Blaster Co. takes pride
in its excellent safety record. It runs a state 
of-the-art training program for employees,
and constantly demands that employees act
with the utmost care. Careless employees are
summarily dismissed.

Rudy, a Blaster Co. employee, carelessly left
a container of liquid nitroglycerin in the aisle
of an unlighted section of Blaster Co. 's ware 
house. Susan, an inspector from the state
Department of Safety, tripped over the con 
tainer. Fortunately, it did not explode, but
Susan broke her arm when she fell.

91.

If Susan sues Blaster Co. for injuries
she suffered when she broke her arm:

A. Blaster Co. should be held
strictly liable because it is en 
gaged in abnormally dangerous
activity.

B. Blaster Co. should be held liable
because its employee was negli 
gent.

C. Blaster Co. should not be liable
because the injury was not rea 
sonably foreseeable.

D. Blaster Co. should not be liable
because Susan's injury is cov 
ered by worker's compensation.

TCJiIS EJ

92. Blaster Co. 's safety controls and its
policy of summarily dismissing care 
less employees will:

A. Prevent Susan from recovering
from Blaster Co., because Rudy
was engaged in a frolic and de 
tour.

B. Prevent Susan from recovering
from Blaster Co., because Rudy
was acting beyond the scope of
his employment.

Questions 93 - 94 are based on the
following facts:

Arlene purchased a toaster which was manu 
factured by Crispco. The first time she used
the toaster, a wire shorted and caused a fire.
Arlene's kitchen was destroyed and she re 
ceived minor burns in attempting to extin 
guish the blaze. An investigation revealed
that the type of wire in question, which was
used in all Crispco toasters, was inadequate
to safely conduct normal household electri 
cal current.

C. Not prevent Susan from recov 

93.

ering from Rudy only.

IfArlene sues Crispco for injuries to her
kitchen and person, the most appropri 
ate cause of action would be:

D. Not prevent Susan from recov 
ering from both Rudy and
Blaster Co.

A. A suit for strict liability in tort,
because the toaster had a manu 
facturing defect.

B. A suit for strict liability in tort,
because the toaster had a design
defect.

C. A suit for strict liability in tort,
because Crispco failed to warn
of the danger.

D. A negligence action, provided
Arlene can show that Crispco
and she were in privity.

94. Assume, for this question, that the in 
adequate wire caused the toaster to be
destroyed, but that Arlene and her
kitchen were not harmed. IfArlene sues
Crispco in tort to recover the cost of a
replacement toaster, the result will be:

A. Arlene will recover because the
toaster had a manufacturing de-
fect.

B. Arlene will recover because the
toaster had a design defect.

C. Arlene will recover because
Crispco breached its implied
warranty of merchantability.

D. Arlene will not recover.

Questions 95 — 96 are based on the
following facts:

Sandra, a physician, was driving to the bal-
let with a friend. A car driven by Don had
overturned on the road ahead and Don was
severely injured. Emergency paramedics had
not arrived on the scene, and Sandra could
see that Don was bleeding. Although Sandra
believed she could stop the bleeding, she
decided to continue on her journey to the
ballet so that she would not miss the first
act. Don died from loss of blood. He left a
wife and two minor children.   

95. If Don's wife and children sue Sandra

for wrongful death:

A. They will recover because a phy-
sician has a common law duty to
stop and assist an accident vic-
tim.

B. They will recover because most
states modernly require physi-
cians to stop and assist an acci-
dent victim.

C. They will recover because the
American Medical Association's
Principles of Medical Ethics re-
quire physicians to render emer-
gency medical services to the
best of their ability.

D. They will not recover. 

TORTS 255

    
96. Assume, for this question, that Sandra
stopped to assist Don, but that her treat 
ment was below the professional stan 
dard of care and Don died. If Don's wife
and children sue Sandra for wrongful
death, in a state that has a Good Samari 
tan statute:

A. They will recover because
Sandra undertook a duty and per 
formed it negligently.

B. They will recover because Good
Samaritan statutes provide phy 
sician liability for negligent acts.

C. They will recover, assuming they
can prove Sandra acted reck 
lessly in the circumstances.

D. They will recover, but only to the
extent that Sandra was negligent
and aggravated Don's injuries.

Questions 97 - 99 are based on the
following facts:

Clara learned she was pregnant with her first
child. Clara's family had a history of con 
genital birth defects, so she went to her doc 
tor, Anna, for tests to determine if her fetus
would likely be born in an impaired state.
Anna performed amniocentesis, a procedure
that can detect chromosomal abnormalities.
Anna negligently misread the test results and
informed Clara that the fetus was normal.
Clara carried the fetus to term. Her child,
Randolph, has severe birth defects.
Randolph will require expensive medical
care and special education for his entire life.

97. If Randolph sues Anna for damages, in
most jurisdictions, his cause of action
would be called a suit for:

A. Wrongful birth.

B. Wrongful life.

C. Wrongful death.

D. None of the above.

98. Anna would prevail in Randolph's suit

against her, if she could prove:

A. When Anna performed the am 
niocentesis procedure, she did
not actually injure the fetus.

B. Clara's religion forbade abortion
and Clara would have given birth
to Randolph anyway.

C. Anna could not have reasonably
foreseen the extent of Ran 
dolph's medical and educational
expenses.

D. Clara signed a form agreeing not
to sue Anna for negligence.

99.

In most states that recognize Randolph's
claim against Anna, his recovery would
include:

I. General damages.

II. Special damages.

III. Punitive damages.

A. I only.

B.

II only.

C.

I and II only.

D. I, II and III.

100. Clancy retained Wanda, an attorney, to
write his will. They entered into a stan 
dard written attorney-client contract
and Clancy paid the fee Wanda
charged. Clancy instructed Wanda that
he wished to leave his real property to
Fred, his favorite nephew. Wanda pre 
pared the will, but carelessly over 
looked a relevant section of the Pro 
bate Act.

When Clancy died and the will was
offered for probate, Fred and the other
heirs learned of Wanda's error. As a
direct result of the error, the devise to
Fred was adeemed and Fred received
nothing from Clancy's estate.

If Fred sues Wanda for professional
negligence in the preparation of
Clancy's will, in most jurisdictions to 
day the likely outcome will be:

A. Fred will not recover because he
was not in privity of contract
with Wanda.

B. Fred will not recover because an
attorney does not owe a duty of
care to anyone but his client.

C. Fred will recover because he is a
third party beneficiary of the
contract between Wanda and
Clancy.

D. Fred will recover, but his dam 
ages will be limited to the fee
Clancy paid Wanda.

Questions 101 -104 are based on
the following facts:

Peter was driving his Tetra car down the
highway at the legal speed limit when traf 
fic suddenly stopped ahead of him. Because
he was driving cautiously, Peter was able to
come to a smooth stop about ten feet from
the car ahead of him. Denny was driving
behind Peter and had taken his eyes off of
the road for a second or two to adjust his
radio. During that short period of time that
Denny's attention was distracted, the traffic
stopped and Denny was unable to stop be 
fore hitting Peter's car in the rear. When
Denny hit Peter's car, it was pushed forward
quickly and the back of Peter's head hit the
head rest. The headrest was built of padding
around a central metal core. The metal core
was shaped like the cross section of an air 
plane wing, with a rounded point in front
and a sharper point to the rear, giving the
head rest an aerodynamic shape. As Peter's
head hit the rest, the padding compressed
and allowed the front portion of the metal
core to focus and concentrate the pressure
on the back of Peter's head to a small area,
causing a fracture to his skull and first ver 
tebra. Had the metal core been broader and
flat, it would have spread the pressure over
a wider area and caused no damage to Peter.
Peter is paralyzed from the neck down as a
result. Peter has sued the car maker, Tetra,
under Restatement Torts 2d 402A.

B. The product was defective.

C. That he has privity with the

Manufacturer.

D. He received the product as a re 

sult of a technical sale.

102. On the facts set forth above, the prod 

uct has the following defect:

A. A design defect, because it cre 

ates an avoidable hazard.

B. A manufacturing defect, because

it was made as intended.

C. A marketing defect, because it
was advertised as a safe car.

D. A fabrication defect, because the

core was too thin.

103. The best defense that Tetra could of 

fer is:

A. That this was the first time this

had happened and TetraDwas not
aware of the danger.

B. That the car was sold with a le 
gally effective disclaimer of li 
ability.

C. That Peter was contributorily

the burden of proving:

A. The manufacturer was unreason 

able.

D. That the car was designed to be
driven and wrecking it wasDa
form of misuse.

•

lUi IS

104. Tetra contends that it should only be
liable for the enhanced damages
caused by the defective head rest, and
that Danny should be liable for all
other damages. This argument is:

A. Incorrect because Tetra was a
substantial factor in causing
Peter's damages.

B. Correct because some damage to
Pete would have occurred even
if the head rest was properly de 
signed.

C. Correct, but Tetra has the burden
of apportioning the damages.

D. Correct, and Peter must prove
what portion of his damages
were caused by Tetra in order to
recover.

Questions 105 -109 are based on
the following facts:

Questa Corp manufactured carpets. One of
its carpets was a thick plush, advertised and
promoted mainly as a good carpet for hotels
and motels because of its long wearing quali 
ties. It's trade name was Royal Plush. Prince
Hotel purchased the Royal Plush carpet and
had it installed in the halls and lobby, hav 
ing to close the hotel down in order to rip up
the old carpet and install the new. This job
was accomplished just prior to the opening
of the summer season, a time during which
Prince Hotel could expect full occupancy
and make a good profit. Before reopening,
the hotel had to get a certificate from the
local fire inspector. The fire inspector tested
a sample of the carpet and found it was
highly flammable, so refused to certify the
hotel for occupancy.

Prince Hotel had to remain closed, rip up
the carpet and install new, fire retardant car 
pet, and lost all profits from the first month
of the summer season.

105. If Prince Hotel sues Questa Corp on a
theory of negligence and 402A, it will
probably:

A. Not recover for lost profit, be 

cause this is pure economicDloss.

B. Recover for expense of replac 

ing the carpets.

C. Recover for profits lost while the

hotel was closed.

1mIS Em

D. Both Band C.

106. On these facts the best theory of re 

covery for Prince Hotel is:

A. Negligence.

B. 402A.

C. Express warranty.

B. Prince Hotel was negligent in not
discovering the flammable qual 
ity of the carpet.

C. The arsonist was a superseding

cause of Patricia's injury.

D. Patricia is an unforeseeable
plaintiff and barred underDthe
rule enunciated by Justice
Cardozo in Palsgraff.

D. Implied warranty of merchant 

ability.

108. Patricia seeks to recover the follow 

ing damages:

107. In addition to the above facts, assume
that a fire retardant is available that
would make the Royal Plush carpet
safe at a reasonable cost, and that this
retardant is generally used in the car 
pet industry. Questa made a practice
of not using the fire retardant because
it enabled Questa to make an additional
1% profit on its carpet sales. After the
carpet is installed Prince Hotel opens
to the public and is fully occupied
when a disgruntled employee deliber 
ately starts a fire to express his anger
at the hotel. Patricia, a guest, is se 
verely burned over most of her body
in the fire because of the high flam 
mability of the carpet. She is perma 
nently scarred and disabled as a result.
On these facts, Questa's best defense
in a suit by Patricia would be:

I. Compensation for her

medical expenses.

II. Compensation for her
lost wages and earning
capacity.

III. Compensation for pain

and suffering.

IV. Punitive damages against

Questa.

She will probably recover the follow 
ing:

A. I and II only.

B.

I and III only.

A. Patricia lacks privity and cannot

C.

I, II and III, but not IV.

sue Questa.

D. All four.

1m TailS

109. If Patricia seeks recovery from the ho 
tel by joining it as a party defendant in
her lawsuit against the carpet maker,
her best theory for recovery is:

A. A suit under Rest. Torts 2d 402A.

B. A suit as a business invitee.

C. A suit under Rest. Torts 2d 402B.

D. A suit under some form of war 

ranty.

110. If Patricia obtains a substantial judg 
ment against both Questa and Prince
Hotel, and Prince Hotel satisfies the
judgment, it will be entitled to sue
Questa for:

A. Indemnity.

B. Contribution.

C. Equitable Apportionment.

D. None of the above.

Questions 111 -114 are based on
the following facts:

Ajax Corp made a drug called Alphacin used
to treat Multiple Sclerosis, a degenerative
and usually fatal disease. Alphacin was ef 
fective in treating MS and prevented further
degeneration as long as the drug was taken,
but contained a component part, a compound
called Chlorofin, which caused a deteriora 
tion ofthe optic nerve and consequent blind 
ness in a small percentage of patients who
used the drug over a long period of time.
Ajax marketed the drug from 1980 through
1985, at which time the side effect was dis 
covered. Ajax stopped marketing the drug
after discovering the side effect. Baxter Drug
Co also made a drug call Betacin, used for
the treatment of MS, which also contained
the ingredient Ch10rofin. Chlorofin is the
ingredient in the medication that causes it to
be effective in treating MS. Baxter Drug Co
continued to market Betacin through 1990
without a warning of the side effect, even
though Baxter knew or could have known
of the side effect as early as 1986. In 1991,
Baxter Drug Co began publishing a warn 
ing of the side effect in the Physician's Desk
Reference and also in package inserts.
Pauline had been taking Alphacin through a
prescription from her physician, Dr. Smith,
since 1980. When Alphacin was discontin 
ued in 1985, Dr. Smith began prescribing
Betacin and Pauline continued taking
Betacin until 1993 when she went blind. She
has sued Baxter Drug Co on a theory of strict
products liability under Rest. Torts 2d 402A.

~lsEl

111. On these facts, Pauline will probably
be able to prove that the drug Betacin
marketed by Baxter Drug Co is defec 
tive under a theory of:

A. Manufacturing defect.

B. Design Defect.

C. Warning Defect.

D. She can't prove defectiveness.

112. At trial of the case against Baxter Drug
Co., all the expert witnesses agree that
Pauline would probably have gone
blind from the effects of taking
Alphacin for five years, even if she had
never taken Betacin; they also agree
that Betacin would have caused the
blindness as a result of taking the drug
for more than five years. In attempt 
ing to prove that Baxter Drug Co. 's ac 
tions were the cause in fact of her in 
jury, Pauline must rely on:

A. Pauline had no choice but to take

the drug.

B. The degenerative effect of un 
treated MS was much more se 
vere than the side effect.

C. Pauline would have died from
the disease but for the drug.

D. Dr. Smith's continued prescrib 

ing of the drug shows theDlack of
warning was not the cause of her
injury.

114. If Pauline sues Dr. Smith for prescrib 
ing the drug without warning her, she
may prevail under the following
theory:

A. Negligent failure to obtain her

informed consent.

B. Strict liability of section 402A of

Rest. Torts 2d.

A. The Sine Qua Non test.

C. Breach of implied warranty of

B. The Substantial Factor test.

D. Market Share Liability under the

actual causation, Baxter Drug Co. may
successfully argue the following:

Questions 115 -117 are based on
the following facts:

Pete worked for many years as an installer
of asbestos insulation. He became ill at age
55 and was diagnosed as suffering from As 
bestosis, a disease caused by exposure to
small asbestos spicules that lodge in the
lungs and, after a long incubation period of
10 to 20 years, result in asbestosis. Pete was
never warned of the danger of breathing as 
bestos dust, and had he been warned he could
have worn a simple protective mask to pre 
vent the asbestos spicules from entering his
lungs. Pete is barred from suing his employer
by the worker's compensation act of the
state. He wants to sue the manufacturer of
the asbestos insulation sold to his employer
and installed by the workers, including Pete.
Although the asbestos industry had been
aware of the hazards of asbestos dust and
particles to workers using insulation for
more than 50 years, no warnings had ever
been issued by the asbestos manufacturers.
Pete knows that his employer has purchased
asbestos insulation from Ajax Asbestos Co
during Pete's tenure, and knows also that his
employer has purchased insulation from at
least 10 other manufacturers while Pete
worked there. He is unable to discover the
identity of the other asbestos suppliers.

115. In order to get a complete recovery for
his damages in the case, Pete should
use:

B. The Substantial Factor test for

causation in fact.

C. Alternative liability under Sum 

mers v. Tice.

D. Market Share Liability under the

Sindell case.

116. Ajax Asbestos Co had only been in the
asbestos business for five years and
claims it did not have access to early
studies that showed the danger of as 
bestos to workers installing insulation.
These facts may provide an arguable
defense based on:

A. The State of the Art.

B. The claim that there is no design

defect.

C. Ajax was not the cause in fact of

Pete's injury.

D. All of the above.

117. If Pete sues Ajax for breach of implied
warranty, the best defense available on
these facts for Ajax is:

A. There is no warranty because no

representation concerningDthe
product were made by Ajax.

B. All warranties were disclaimed

A. The Sine qua non test for causa 

by Ajax.

tion in fact.

C. Pete lacks vertical privity.

D. Pete lacks horizontal privity.

lQ11S EI

B. Negligence.

C. Warranty.

D. All of the above.

119. If Patricia sues Jim's Off Road Shoppe
for breach of Express Warranty, Jim's
best defense would be:

A. Jim made no warranty.

B. Patricia lacks vertical privity.

C. Patricia lacks horizontal privity.

D. Patricia can't prove a defect.

120. If Patricia sues Wily Car Co for 402a
and Negligence, the best way she can
prove the vehicle was defective is by
use of:

A. Res Ipsa Loquitor.

B. Her expert's testimony that a
missing spring was the possible
cause of the transmission failure.

C. The fact that it was a new ve 

hicle, she had not damaged itDor
had it serviced improperly.

D. Circumstantial evidence.

Questions 118 -121 are based on
the following facts:

Patricia watched, with interest, a series of
television ads for a vehicle called "the Out 
law" produced by Wily Car Co. These ads
showed the four-wheel drive Outlaw going
up and down extremely steep hills, bounc 
ing over large rocks, and generally giving
the impression that it was a remarkably rug 
ged and powerful machine. Patricia went to
the local dealer for Wily Car Co, Jim's Off
Road Shoppe, and purchased an Outlaw. She
immediately took her new vehicle up into
the rugged mountains near her home and, as
she was driving up a steep dirt road, decided
to put the vehicle into four-wheel drive. The
Outlaw climbed the steep slope in the four
wheel drive, but when Patricia started down
the equally-steep reverse slope, the transmis 
sion did not slow the vehicle down, she lost
control and wrecked the vehicle on a large
boulder at the bottom of the hill. Patricia
miraculously escaped injury. She hired a
mechanical engineer to look at the vehicle,
to determine what happened. Because the
transmission and the linkage were destroyed
in the crash, he was unable to determine if
there was any kind of defect, but he said it
was possible that a spring was not fastened
that would have permitted the transmission
to slip out of gear and free wheel down the
slope, although it would have worked fine
when going up hill.

118. On these facts, Patricia's best chance
for a full recovery would be a suit
based on:

A. Rest. Torts 2d 402A.

121. Just before trial of her case against
Wily Car Co., Patricia discovers that
Wily Car Co. has discontinued using
cast aluminum gear boxes on the Out 
law transmission, and has instead sub 
stituted cast iron gear boxes; a much
stronger material. She wishes to intro 
duce evidence of this fact to the jury.
A motion in limine made by Wily Car
Co. to exclude this evidence will likely
be:

A. Denied, because fault is not at is 

sue.

B. Granted, because the evidence is

irrelevant.

C. Granted, because of the public
policy to encourage safety.

D. Denied, because it shows that
Wily Car Co. has a conscious 
ness of guilt.

END OF QUESTIONS

TORTSANSWERS

1. B is the correct answer, since a private
nuisance action will protect Stan's right
to use and enjoy his property. A is in 
correct because the facts show that the
gas is harmless. C is incorrect, since the
facts do not state that other members of
the public are affected by the gas. D is
incorrect because there is no statement
that Oil Company was careless.

2. D is the correct answer, since a person
in lawful possession of land has stand 
ing to bring suit to abate a private nui 
sance. A is incorrect because one need
not be an owner to sue for private nui 
sance. B is incorrect, since a private citi 
zen can bring suit to abate a public nui 
sance when he has an injury different
in kind from the general public. C is
incorrect because mere residency in the
area does not confer standing.

3. B is the correct answer. Since an equity
court, when considering whether to
abate a nuisance, will balance the hard 
ships and find that the value of the re 
finery as operated outweighs Stan's
occasional inconvenience. Stan, of
course, can still recover damages. A is
incorrect because coming to the nui 
sance is not a complete defense, but
rather one factor the court will consider
on the abatement issue. C is incorrect
because it is not relevant to Stan's indi 
vidual claim for private nuisance. D is
an incorrect statement of law.

4. A is the correct answer because one who
intentionally deceives another, even for
a good motive, is liable for common law
deceit. B is incorrect, since Stock 
broker's act was intentional, not negli 
gent. C is incorrect because malice is
not an element for common law deceit.
D is incorrect because Aaron was justi 
fied in relying on the statement of a
trusted financial advisor.

5. B is the correct answer because Aaron
must show that he was induced by
Stockbroker's statement when he
bought the stock as an element of com 
mon law deceit. If he intended to pur 
chase the stock anyway, he has not met
this element. A is incorrect because
Stockbroker made a false statement of
fact, even if in good faith. C is incor 
rect because the facts show Aaron has
out-of-pocket damages. D is incorrect
because it is reasonably foreseeable to
a broker that a company might become
insolvent.

6. B is the correct answer, since Account 
ant's carelessness in preparing the au 
dit was a negligent misrepresentation
to one relying on it. A is incorrect be 
cause Accountant did not intend to de 
ceive anyone. C is incorrect becauseAc 
countant was negligent according to the
facts. D is incorrect because B is cor 
rect.

TCJiIS II

10. B is the correct answer, since when one
disparages the product of another
through false statements of fact, a cause
of action for trade libel arises. A is in 
correct, since the honesty and ethical
integrity of Stopco has not been chal 
lenged. C is incorrect, since this tort
does not exist. D is incorrect, as Stopco
has not been injured by relying on any
misrepresentation made to it.

11. C is the correct answer, since the com 
mon law required a trade libel plaintiff
to show special damages in the form of
particular lost customers or profits. A
is not correct because a general loss of
profits is not enough to meet the spe 
cial damages rule. B is incorrect, for
basically the same reason. D is a false
statement of law, as Brakeco's actions
exceed the bounds of legal business
competition.

12. B is the correct answer, since Clay has
misappropriated Grey's image for
Clay's commercial benefit. A is incor 
rect, since there has been no disclosure
of private facts about Grey. C is incor 
rect, since publication of the picture did
not invade on Grey's seclusion. D is
incorrect, since picturing Grey in a
reputable sporting goods ad did not
place him in a false light.

7. A is the correct answer. Under the ma 
jority rule of Ultramares v. Touche, one
making a negligent misrepresentation
is liable only to third parties in situa 
tions approaching privity of contract.
Since Accountant did not know of the
existence of Federal Bank or that it
would be making a loan, the privity-like
requirement is not met. B is incorrect
because Federal Bank did rely on the
audit report. C is incorrect because it
states the minority rule. D is incorrect
because it states a spurious legal prin 
ciple.

8. C is the correct answer because one
cannot justifiably rely on statements of
opinion of quality and value when en 
tering into a contract. A is incorrect,
since Harry did not commit fraud,
Clay's Cars cannot be vicariously liable.
B is an incorrect statement of law. D is
also a plainly incorrect statement oflaw,
as deceit is a tort action and is not based
on contract. Any contractual waiver of
fraud liability would violate public
policy.

9. C is the correct answer, since courts
have long recognized that active con 
cealment constitutes common law de 
ceit. A is incorrect because a false state 
ment is not necessary in concealment
cases. B is incorrect because the con 
cealment was designed to cover the
crack and to discourage Rhonda from
making further inspection. D is in 
correct because an "as is" clause does
not insulate one from liability for fraud.

E~IS

16. D is the correct answer because the
negative covenant is reasonable in geo 
graphical location (the city) and in time
(one year). A is incorrect because a
court will not order a person to perform
a personal services contract. B is in 
correct because an injunction based on
the negative covenant will issue. C is
incorrect because the covenant's terms
are not unreasonable.

17. B is the correct answer because Profes 
sor Smith committed an assault. An ac 
tor is liable for assault if he intends to
cause a harmful or offensive contact,
or creates a reasonable apprehension of
contact, and the victim believes that the
contact is imminent. A is incorrect be 
cause the facts do not show that Logan
and Adam suffered any emotional dis 
tress. C is incorrect because contact is
a requirement for battery, not assault.
D is incorrect because Professor Smith
should have known that his act was sub 
stantially certain to cause an apprehen 
sion of an imminent harmful or offen 
sive contact.

13. C is the correct answer, because Clem 
ent has used an appropriate civil pro 
cess for an unlawful purpose. He is not
merely collecting on a valid judgment,
but is attempting to punish Lake
through his excessive executions. A is
incorrect because Clement had probable
cause to bring the execution and is en 
titled to attach property valued at $100.
B is incorrect because this is not a crimi 
nal case. D is plainly incorrect, as there
has been no conversion.

14. A is the correct answer, since it is not a
prerequisite for an abuse of process ac 
tion that the proceeding be terminated
in plaintiff's favor. B is incorrect be 
cause Lake must show that Clement had
an ulterior motive for his actions. C is
not correct because a plaintiff must
show some damage, be it financial or
otherwise. D is not correct because
abuse of process is an intentional tort.

15. C is the correct answer because the tort
of intentional interference with contrac 
tual relations requires intentional, pur 
poseful conduct. A is incorrect because
it misstates contract law. B is incorrect,
since the suit is based on tort, not on
breach of any agreement between the
colleges. D is incorrect in that it indi 
cates a tort action would lie if the con 
duct was not intentional.

TCJiIS 1m

21. B is the correct answer because the neg 
ligence per se rule provides that a stat 
ute sets the duty of care when the plain 
tiff is within the protected class and the
statute was designed to prevent against
the type of injury which occurred. A is
incorrect because it states the res ipsa
loquitor rule. C is incorrect because a
statute, not the jury, determines the duty
of care in a negligence per se case. D is
incorrect because the negligence ofPe 
ter has no bearing on the application of
the negligence per se standard.

22. B is the best answer, since Sherry can
argue that it was not reasonably fore 
seeable that a person would steal her
car and drive it negligently. If the court
finds Peter's actions to be a supersed 
ing cause, Sherry will not be liable. A
is incorrect because the last clear chance
doctrine is a rule designed to save the
plaintiff's case when he is contributorily
negligent. The facts here do not show
any negligence on the part of Alfred. C
is incorrect because it overstates the
effect of an intentional tortfeasor in a
negligence case. Intentional acts are not
always unforeseeable. D is incorrect
because Sherry's insurance coverage is
irrelevant.

18. D is the correct answer, since, under the
doctrine of transferred intent, Professor
Smith is held to have intended to com 
mit the battery against Davey. A is not
correct because the transferred intent
rule is a legal fiction that does impute
intent. B is incorrect, since a defendant
is responsible for all personal injuries
resulting from a tort. C is an incorrect
statement of the transferred intent doc 
trine. If one intends to commit an as 
sault on one person and batters another,
transferred intent applies.

19. B is the correct answer, because dam 
ages are presumed in trespass cases.
Even if Eunice cannot show actual dam 
age, the law will allow nominal dam 
ages. A is incorrect because the facts
show Calvin was a trespasser, not a lic 
ensee. C is incorrect because the only
intent necessary for trespass is to walk
on the land, an intent that Calvin had.
D is incorrect for the same reason stated
in B.

20. D is the correct answer because Eunice
(as a land owner/occupier) owes a duty
to an undiscovered trespasser not to set
traps for him. A is incorrect for the rea 
son stated above. The fact that the land
was posted is irrelevant. B is incorrect
because Calvin is not a licensee. C is
incorrect because Eunice cannot protect
her property by use of a trap.

1m 1Q11S

23. C is the correct answer because a child
who engages in adult activity, such as
driving a car, is held to the adult stan 
dard of the reasonable prudent person.
A is incorrect, since Peter will not be
liable in the absence of fault. B is in 
correct because the subjective standard
for children does not apply when a mi 
nor is engaged in adult activity. D is
incorrect because a twelve-year-old can
be negligent.

24. A is the correct answer because most
jurisdictions follow the zone of danger
rule. Dieter was a reasonably foresee 
able plaintiff because Eddie was aware
of his presence and it is unlikely that
Dieter will be feigning his injuries. B
is incorrect, since most jurisdictions do
not require a physical impact. C is in 
correct, since the close relationship re 
quirement applies only when a witness
is outside the zone of danger. D is in 
correct for the reasons stated in A.

25. A is the correct answer because the
common law recognized joint and sev 
eral liability for joint tortfeasors. B is
incorrect because indemnification in 
volves a claim for payment that one
tortfeasor has against another. C is in 
correct because contribution involves a
claim by one tortfeasor against another
for a fair sharing of damage liability. D
is an incorrect statement of law.

26. D is the correct answer, as Denton has
lawfully come onto Miller's property
primarily for his own purposes as an
employee of Power Company. A is in 
correct because Denton's entry was
lawful in light of the easement. B is in 
correct, as Denton did not enter Miller's
land at the express or implied invita 
tion of Miller. C is incorrect, since the
facts do not show that Denton was
Miller's social guest.

27. B is the correct answer because the duty
of care owed by a landowner to a lic 
ensee is only to warn of dangers known
by the landowner. A is incorrect because
since Denton is not an undiscovered
trespasser, Miller does owe him a duty
of care. C is incorrect, since a land 
owner owes this more extensive duty
to an invitee. D is incorrect because the
common law recognized a more lim 
ited duty for landowners than the rea 
sonable prudent person test.

28. C is the correct answer because
plaintiff's contributory negligence,
even if slight, totally barred recovery
against a defendant at common law. A
is incorrect; even under comparative
fault principles, Arlen would not re 
cover the full $100,000. B is incorrect,
since this is the result under a compara 
tive negligence scheme. D is incorrect
because the facts do not show that Arlen
voluntarily assumed the risk of a known
danger.

nus fDI

29. A is the correct answer, since the last
clear chance rule "saves" the contribu 
torily negligent plaintiff's case and puts
the entire burden of loss on defendant.
B is incorrect, since the last clear chance
rule does not apportion damages ac 
cording to degree of fault. C is incor 
rect for the reason stated in A. D is in 
correct for the same reason that A is
correct.

30. D is the correct answer because under
Columbia's modified comparative neg 
ligence statute, Wanda will recover
nothing because her negligence was
greater than Tom's. A is incorrect be 
cause Wanda is given the full amount
of her damages without consideration
of her fault. B is incorrect because of
the statutory language; it would be an
incorrect calculation even under a pure
comparative negligence scheme. C is
incorrect because of the statutory lan 
guage. If Columbia had a pure compara 
tive fault system like California's, this
would be the correct answer.

31. C is the correct answer. The Restate 
ment Second of Torts establishes that
one who carries on an abnormally dan 
gerous activity is subject to liability for
harm to the person, land or chattels of
another resulting from the activity, al 
though he has exercised the utmost care
to prevent the harm. Here, in these facts
Gasco, through the escaping gas, causes
harm to repairman. Even though the
escaping gas was not caused by any
fault on Gasco's part, they will be sub 
ject to liability. A is incorrect as there
was no intentional touching (a require 
ment of battery). B is incorrect because
there was no invasion of the repairman's
use and enjoyment of his land. D is in 
correct because Gasco was not negli 
gent.

32. D is the correct answer. Where strict li 
ability is applied, evidence that Gasco
is without fault is of no consequence.
A and B are incorrect because the justi 
fication for strict liability is that, "use 
ful but dangerous activities must pay
their own way." The fact that extreme
care was used will not matter. C is in 
correct because the gas was not negli 
gently stored.

fiB lQilS

33. C is the correct answer. The general rule
is that contributory negligence is not a
defense to strict liability. The only ex 
ception is where the plaintiff knows of
the danger and his negligence is the
cause of the activity creating harm. A
is incorrect because the repairman did
not know of the risk much less assume
it. B is incorrect because the repairman
was not negligent. D, although a cor 
rect statement, is not the best answer
since it fails to spot the issue of the gen 
eral relevance of contributory negli 
gence to strict liability.

34. A is the best answer. Liability only ex 
tends to foreseeable hazards. Although
it is arguable whether this type of dam 
age was foreseeable, because the an 
swer choice indicates that the damages
claimed by the car lot were unforesee 
able, this is the best alternative. B is an
incorrect statement because the fair
market value is protected. C is arguably
factually correct, butAremains the bet 
ter answer because it is a correct state 
ment of the law. D is an incorrect state 
ment of law.

35. D is the correct answer. Where one is
responsible for putting another in peril
then a duty is owed to one who attempts
a rescue as long as the rescuer is acting
reasonably under the circumstances.
Here, neighbor was acting reasonably
in trying to assist repairman. The haste
in the rescue attempt is what caused
neighbor to trip in the gopher hole and
Gasco will be liable. A is incorrect as
neighbor did not assume the risk. B is
incorrect because neighbor's conduct
does not have to be foreseeable, just rea 
sonable under the circumstances. C is
not a complete statement as to why
Gasco would owe liability, and, there 
fore, D is the better answer.

36. B is the best answer. Shopper will ar 
gue that she was a potential customer
since she may come back later and
make a purchase. Courts have held that
one who enters a store open to the pub 
lic is a potential customer. Here, Shop 
per, a business invitee, is owed a duty
by Happytime to inspect and remedy
any defect on the premises. Res ipsa
loquitur is relevant when there is a rea 
sonable presumption that the defendant
is the negligent actor. A is incorrect
because the door could be defective
without negligence. C is not the best
theory because if Shopper was only a
licensee, Happytime would only owe a
duty to warn of known defects. The
facts do not indicate that Happytime
knew of the defective door. D is incor 
rect because B is a viable theory for
recovery.

TGIIS II

39. B is the best answer. The Doctrine of
Respondeat Superior would cause Otis
to be liable for the negligence of his
employee, which occurred during the
course and scope of employment. A is
not the best answer because Otis was not
negligent - his employee was. Martha
would have a better chance of recovery
against Otis (deep pocket theory) than
the employee. C is incorrect, as strict
liability is not applicable to this fact
pattern involving non-inherently-dan 
gerous-activity. D is incorrect because,
although Otis was not negligent, he can
still be held liable under Respondeat
Superior.

37. A is the best answer. Because there is
absence of evidence as to the breach
of duty owed by Kent, the best theory
is Res Ipsa Loquitur. Under the Re 
statement Second of Torts, it may be
inferred that harm suffered by the
plaintiff is caused by the negligence of
the defendant when: 1) The event is of
a kind which ordinarily does not occur
in the absence of negligence; 2) The
negligence must be within the scope of
a duty that the defendant owes plaintiff;
3) Plaintiff must not have contributed to
his own injury. Therefore, the elements
of Res Ipsa have been satisfied and
would be Pete's best theory of recovery.
Band C are not correct answers because
they would and could not establish fault
on Kent's part. Rather, they are causes
of action brought by the surviving
spouse or the estate. D is an incorrect
and irrelevant statement of law as ap 
plied to these facts. Causation is only
one element of the required proof of a
tort.

38. D is the correct answer. In most courts,
Res Ipsa warrants an inference that
the defendant is negligent. A is incor 
rect. The jury mayor may not agree
on the inference that the defendant is
negligent. B is an incorrect statement
as it would be up to the jury to decide
whether they find Kent negligent or not.
C is incorrect because even if Res Ipsa
is established the jury may find that the
defendant has sufficient evidence to
rebut the presumption. If this were the
case, Pete would not win.

fill TORTS

40. C is the best answer. Martha could es 
tablish the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine
since: 1) Martha is only 6 years of age,
and could not appreciate the dangerous
condition of the pile of rolled window
shades. 2) Since the pile of shades was
an artificial condition created by Otis'
employee, it could be said that the pile
would be attractive to children of
Martha's age. 3) The pile of shades
could have been made safe with little
effort on Otis or his employee's part.
4) It can also be said that the pile of
shades was the cause of Martha's tres 
pass. 5) Otis should have been aware
of the risk, as he should know of the
inquisitive nature of children and the
likelihood that children will go behind
counters. A is incorrect as it is not the
best theory of recovery. B is incorrect
because it is not a complete answer or
the best answer. D is incorrect because
it relies on negligence, which is not the
best theory of law for this case.

41. C is the correct answer. Otis would be
unsuccessful asserting the defense of
contributory negligence, since a find 
ing of Attractive Nuisance would ne 
gate such a possibility. Further, Martha,
being so young, is considered incapable
of contributory negligence. A is incor 
rect because, Martha being of such a
young age, is considered incapable of
assuming any risks. B is incorrect, as
the successful application of the Attrac 
tive Nuisance Doctrine would find Otis
responsible for her injuries. D is an in 
correct statement of law.

42. B is the correct answer. Each of the de 
fendants has the burden of proving that
it was not his gun which fired the dam 
aging pellet. Since this burden is equally
impossible for each defendant, the ef 
fect is to make them jointly and sever 
ally liable. A is incorrect because this
test is used where each of the defen 
dant's acts were a substantial factor in
causing the damage. Here, one of the
defendant's acts was not a substantial
factor. C is incorrect because not only
is the "but for" test not the preferable
test of causation; but also because C will
be unable to prove complete responsi 
bility of either A or B. D is incorrect
for the same reason that B is correct.

TCFCIS EiI

45. D is the correct answer. The security
guard had no reasonable grounds for
suspicion. Shopkeepers privilege would
not apply in this situation. A is incor 
rect, since the store had no privilege to
detain the girls. No reasonable suspi 
cion existed. B is incorrect because, un 
der the facts, the girls were not free to
leave. C is incorrect because the suspi 
cion need not be correct -it need only
be reasonable. Therefore, although C's
conclusion is correct, its reasoning is
incorrect.

46. A is the best answer. Restatement Sec 
ond of Torts. sec. 402A holds that one
who sells any product in a defective
condition unreasonably dangerous to
the user or consumer or to his property
is subject to liability for physical harm
thereby caused to the ultimate user or
consumer. Here, A is the best answer
because Hairco was engaged in the sell 
ing of the product and the product was
defective. Although B is a factually cor 
rect answer, it is not the best answer
because Hairco can be liable even if it
was unaware (and therefore could not
warn) of the product defect. A is a more
concise answer. C is incorrect as it is
legally irrelevant and possibly factually
incorrect. D is incorrect for the same
reasons that A is correct.

43. A is the correct answer. Battery is the
intentional harmful or offensive touch 
ing of another without consent or privi 
lege. Battery extends to any part of the
body or anything attached to it. Thus,
when Mary's body contacted the floor,
a "touching" occurred. This touching
was offensive to Mary, and Sue will be
liable to her for battery. B is incorrect,
as assault requires the intentional plac 
ing of another in reasonable apprehen 
sion of a harmful or offensive touching
without consent or privilege. The facts
indicate that Mary was surprised by Sue
pulling out the chair. Therefore, no ap 
prehension could have been created. C
is incorrect because assault does not
exist in this fact pattern, and Choice C
requires both battery and assault. D is
incorrect, as the facts do not imply that
Sue's conduct was extreme and outra 
geous and calculated to cause severe
emotional distress.

44. B is the best answer. Under Restatement
Second of Torts, "a bodily contact is
offensive if it offends a reasonable sense
of personal dignity." Here, Jogger's
conduct would be acceptable under the
circumstances. A is incorrect because
whether harm was caused to Brunette
or not is not at issue. C is incorrect be 
cause, under the circumstances, the
touching would not be considered
harmful, or offensive. D is incorrect
because the facts do not indicate that
Brunette felt any apprehension by
Jogger's conduct.

fml lQilS

47. A is the correct answer. Under the "thin
skull" plaintiff doctrine, which is rec 
ognized in all jurisdictions, a person
injured by the negligent conduct of de 
fendant may recover damages to the full
extent of his injuries where his injuries
are more severe (even if resulting in
death) because of a pre-existing condi 
tion such a hemophilia. Note that dam 
ages in a wrongful death case may be
reduced because of the decedent's low 
ered life expectancy due to the pre-ex 
isting condition. B, C and D are incor 
rect for the reasons supporting Choice
A.

48. A is the best answer because the bur 
den of proof is easier than the other two
choices. B is incorrect as the intentional
element is missing and would be needed
to establish battery. C is not the best
answer as the elements of negligence
would be harder to establish. D is not
the best answer as a warranty theory
would be harder to prove than strict li 
ability.

49. C is the correct answer. Although the
shaking of one's fist under the nose of
another person can constitute an assault,
where the fist shaking is accompanied
by a statement that reasonably would
remove the assaultive effect of the
physical act, there is no assault (as in
this fact situation). A is incorrect for the
reasons discussed above. B is incorrect
because the statement of George re 
moved the assaultive effect of the fist
shaking. D is incorrect because a small
person can certainly assault a big per 
son.

50. A is the best answer. Here, Bob can be
liable for trespass to chattel, even
though he did not intend to interfere
with neighbor's property. It is necessary
only that the defendant intended to deal
with the chattel in the manner in which
he did. B is incorrect because, for this
tort, a reasonable good faith mistake is
no defense. C is incorrect because you
cannot have a battery against an animal.
D is not the best answer. Although Bob
could be charged with cruelty to ani 
mals, his good faith mistake would
probably relieve him of liability.

51. C is the correct answer, since Doctor
committed an offensive, unconsented
touching of Marvin when he removed
the mole. Marvin's express consent to
eye surgery does not extend to the
non-emergency surgery on the mole. A
is incorrect because, while the surgery's
success might limit Marvin's damages,
it is not a defense to a battery action. B
is incorrect because the facts do not re 
veal any consent beyond the eye sur 
gery. D is incorrect because the facts
do not show that Doctor was negligent.

52. A is the correct answer because this is
a classic case of res ipsa loquitur. B is
incorrect because a surgeon is not re 
sponsible for an injury unless he is neg 
ligent. C is incorrect because the doc 
trine of res ipsa loquitur creates an in 
ference of negligence, even if there are
no percipient witnesses. D is incorrect
for the same reasons that A is correct.

53. C is the correct answer because, mod 
ernly, there is a national standard for
most medical specialties. A is incorrect
because it does not take into account
that Doctor is a plastic surgeon. B is
incorrect because the national standard
has replaced the local standard. D is in 
correct because it focuses on Doctor's
subjective qualifications rather than on
those expected of all practitioners of
plastic surgery.

1m lQ'IlS

54. B is the correct answer, because the in 
formed consent doctrine provides that
a physician may be liable for an injury,
even if not caused by negligence, if he
fails to inform a patient of material risks
associated with a medical procedure. A
is incorrect because it overstates the
extent of the surgeon's potentialliabil 
ity. C is incorrect because post hoc ergo
propter hoc (because an event hap 
pened, a preceding event must have
been the cause) is not a correct legal
maxim. D is incorrect for the reasons
that B is correct.

55. A is the correct answer because Darren
may have a cause of action for inten 
tional infliction of emotional distress.
Nancy's conduct appears to be inten 
tional, extreme and outrageous; and it
may have caused extreme emotional
distress. It is the best answer of the four.
B is incorrect because a threat of future
action is not an assault. C is incorrect
because Nancy's acts are intentional,
not negligent. D is incorrect because
Darren has not been placed in a false
light by Nancy.

56. D is the correct answer because the tort
of intentional infliction of emotional
distress encompasses reckless conduct,
which might cause emotional distress
to a reasonably foreseeable bystander.
A is incorrect because intent is not al 
ways required. B is incorrect because
transferred intent does not apply in in 
tentional infliction of emotional distress
cases. C is incorrect because it is in 
consistent with the facts.

57. C is the correct answer, because the
modem rule, as reflected in the Restate 
ment of Torts (Second), allows for re 
covery of severe emotional distress
without any physical injury. A is not
correct because a physical impact is not
required. B is incorrect because most
states do not require a showing of physi 
cal consequences as a prerequisite for
recovery. D is incorrect because a plain 
tiff need not show another underlying
intentional tort to recover for intentional
infliction of emotional distress.

58. A is the correct answer because the neg 
ligence per se rule provides that where
a law, ordinance, or administrative regu 
lation is intended to protect a class of
persons from a particular type of harm,
the legislative body has impliedly es 
tablished the duty of care. B is incor 
rect because the general rule is that the
jury cannot deviate from the negligence
per se standard. C is incorrect because
the ordinance obviously is relevant. D
is incorrect because negligence per se,
not res ipsa loquitur, is at issue.

59. C is the correct answer because Otis will
recover if he shows the beating and rob 
bery were reasonably foreseeable. This
is the best of the four answers. A is in 
correct because courts have found pro 
prietors liable where the intentional acts
of third parties are reasonably foresee 
able. B is incorrect because an act may
be reasonably foreseeable, even if it has
yet to occur. D is incorrect because strict
liability does not apply.

60. C is the correct answer because the facts
show that Nellie's negligence was not
the cause in fact of Willard' s injury.
Willard fainted and fell due to his in 
toxication, not because he could not see
where he was going. A is incorrect be 
cause negligence per se relates to the
duty and breach elements which are al 
ready conceded in the question. B is
incorrect because the element in con 
tention is causation in fact, not proxi 
mate cause. D is an incorrect statement
and application of the last clear chance
rule.

61. B is the correct answer because when
the concurrent negligence of two or
more tortfeasors results in an indivis 
ible injury, they are jointly and sever 
ally liable for plaintiff's entire loss. A
is incorrect because the law does not
require Irene to prove proportionate li 
ability under the circumstances. C is
incorrect because each defendant is li 
able for the entire amount. D is incorrect
because there is no evidence that Irene
voluntarily assumed any risk.

62. D is the correct answer because mod 
em law allows contribution among joint
tortfeasors. A is incorrect because the
satisfaction doctrine limits recovery by
a plaintiff who has already recovered
against another joint tortfeasor. B is in 
correct because Hank is not entitled to
indemnification, but only to having
Trucker share in paying the judgment.
C is incorrect because release is not an
issue raised by the facts.

TailS 1m

63. B is correct because automobile guest
statutes require a higher standard of
culpability on a defendant's part - such
as gross negligence or reckless conduct.
A is incorrect because ordinary negli-
gence is not actionable if there is a guest
statute. C is incorrect because the cul-
pable conduct need not be intentional.
D is incorrect because Irene can have a
recovery, as stated in B.

64. B is the correct answer because Paul's
intentional harmful contact with Tom
is a battery. A is incorrect because the
facts do not reveal that Tom was in ap-
prehension of the contact before it oc-
curred. C is incorrect because the facts
do not show that Paul intended to cause
emotional distress or that Tom suffered
any distress. D is incorrect because this
activity does not give rise to a strict li-
ability tort.

65. C is the correct answer because by play-
ing baseball, Tom impliedly consented
to possible harmful contact that is
within the rules of the game. A is in-
correct because contributory negligence
is not a defense to an intentional tort,
and also because there is no evidence
that Tom was negligent in any case. B
is incorrect because justification is not
a defense raised by the facts. D is in-
correct for the same reason.

1m mils

66. D is the correct answer, since Pam has
not entered Scott's property. A, Band
C are incorrect because they relate to
categories of persons who are on a
landowner's property for different rea-
sons.

67. A is the correct answer because a land-
owner owes a person off the premises a
duty of ordinary care with respect to
artificial conditions the landowner
maintains. B is incorrect because this
is the duty owed a licensee. C is in-
correct because this is the duty owed a
discovered trespasser. D is incorrect for
the same reasons that A is correct.

68. D is the correct answer because it was
reasonably foreseeable that an act of
God could cause the corroded cables to
give way. A is incorrect because an in-
tervening act of God does not automati-
cally relieve one of liability for negli-
gence. B, which is really a rephrasing
of A, is incorrect for the same reason.
C is incorrect because it overstates the
potential liability of a defendant by not
taking foreseeability into account at all.

69. C is the correct answer. In personal in-
jury cases, the adage "you take the
plaintiff as you find her" is still the
majority rule. A is incorrect because
personal injury damages are not limited
to what the defendant might reasonably
foresee. B is incorrect because this is
not a preexisting injury case. D is in-
correct for the same reasons that C is
correct.

70. C is the correct answer because at com 
mon law a cause of action personal to a
plaintiff terminated when the person
died. A is incorrect because wrongful
death actions were not recognized at
common law and, also, because, mod 
ernly, this is a survival claim. B is in 
correct because survival claims were
not recognized at common law. D is in 
correct for the same reasons that C is
correct.

71. A is the correct answer because lost fi 
nancial support, services and society are
available to designated beneficiaries
under a statutorily-created wrongful
death action. B is incorrect because sur 
vival statutes typically allow an estate
to recover for injuries sustained by the
decedent only until the time of death.
C is incorrect because the husband and
children do not qualify for a negligent
infliction of emotional distress claim
and could not recover the damages
mentioned in the question in this type
of action, in any case. D is incorrect
because, without the wrongful death
statute, Grover would not have negli 
gence liability to the husband and chil 
dren.

72. B is the correct answer because an em 
ployer is responsible for the negligence
of an employee, so long as the employee
was acting within the scope of his em 
ployment. Ais incorrect, as the facts do
not state the Army was negligent in hir 
ing Grover. C is incorrect because the
nondelegable duty rule applies to inde 
pendent contractor cases. D is incorrect
because the facts show Grover was not
an independent contractor and Inge's
family certainly would not argue that
he was.

73. C is the correct answer because the
Army will not be vicariously liable for
Grover's negligence if his activity,
when the accident occurred, was totally
unrelated to Army business. A is incor 
rect because the Army would be liable
if Grover were acting within the scope
of his employment. B is incorrect be 
cause superseding cause is not an issue.
D is incorrect because the nondelegable
duty rule applies in the independent
contractor setting.

74. B is the correct answer because Con 
gress waived sovereign immunity in
numerous cases, including negligence,
under the Federal Tort Claims Act of
1946. A is incorrect because sovereign
immunity has never been held to vio 
late the Equal Protection Clause. C is
incorrect because until 1946, United
States government agencies did enjoy
sovereign immunity. D is incorrect be 
cause Congress has waived the immu 
nity in negligence cases.

75. D is the correct answer. Since the state 
ment is not libelous on its face, Sally
Smith must show facts that make the
otherwise innocent statement action 
able. (This fact would be that she is
unmarried.) This is called a reasonable
innuendo. A is incorrect because the
statement is not libelous on its face. B
is incorrect because there has been pub 
lication to others who read the newspa 
per. C is incorrect because the statement
clearly related to the only person named
Sally Smith in the community.

76. D is the correct answer because libel
was a strict liability tort at common law.
Defendants were liable for unintended
and innocent defamation. A, Band C
are incorrect because they all state that
some degree of fault was required in a
common law libel action.

77. A is the correct answer because retrac 
tion and apology are steps a libel de 
fendant can take to limit the damages
caused by a libelous statement. B is in 
correct because the collateral source
rule relates to payments made to a plain 
tiff from a source independent of the
defendant. This doctrine is not raised
by the facts. C is incorrect because the
facts do not show Sally Smith received
any benefit from the libel. D is incorrect
because retraction and apology only
mitigate damages and do not com 
pletely relieve a defendant of liability.

BB TCJiIS

78. B is the correct answer because, al 
though the defamatory statement was
"spoken" on the tape, it has been re 
duced to permanent physical form
through the taping and, thus, would be
libel. A and C are incorrect because they
relate to spoken defamation that is tran 
sitory. D is incorrect because the state 
ment is libelous on its face, without
need to refer to extrinsic evidence.

79. C is the correct answer because a book 
seller who sells libelous matter with 
out knowledge is not liable under the
secondary publisher rule. A is incorrect
because it does not take into account
the exception stated in C. B is incorrect
because Cleo and Roman did not have
a relationship that would give rise to
vicarious liability. D is incorrect be 
cause, since Cleo is not liable, an in 
demnification issue would not arise.

80. B is the correct answer. When a public
official or figure sues for libel related
to a matter of public concern, "actual
malice" as defined in New York Times
v. Sullivan becomes part of the
plaintiff's prima facie case. A is in 
correct because this definition is typi 
cally used for punitive damages by state
courts. C is incorrect, since this is the
rule established in Gertz v. Robert
Welch Co. for private persons defamed
on matters of public concern. D is in 
correct because it embodies the com 
mon law rule, before the Supreme Court
decisions beginning with New York
Times.

81. B is the correct answer, as the Supreme
Court held, in New York Times, that the
burden of proof for "actual malice" is
clear and convincing evidence. There 
fore, A, C and D are incorrect.

82. A is the correct answer because Jenny
has defamed Harriet by accusing her of
unethical business practices and per 
haps, also, the commission of a crime.
Thus, the statement is slander per se for
two reasons. B is incorrect because
there is no slander per quod theory of
recovery. C is incorrect because the
statement goes beyond simple slander.
D is incorrect because this tort does not
protect a plaintiff's reputation interest.

83. C is correct, since Jenny's statement is
an opinion that does not appear to be
premised on false underlying facts. A
is incorrect because the Gertz holding,
regarding opinion, has subsequently
been interpreted in Malkoyich as not
protecting all opinions under a First
Amendment umbrella. B is incorrect
because it does not address the opinion
issue, and also because lawyers are not
always public figures. D is incorrect
because, modernly, an opinion not
based on underlying false facts is not
defamation.

84. C is the correct answer. A witness testi 
fying in a court proceeding has abso 
lute immunity from defamation liabil 
ity, provided the statements relate to
issues in the trial. A is incorrect because
assumption of risk does not apply in
defamation actions. B is incorrect be 
cause this is not a conditional privilege
case. D is incorrect because it overstates
the breadth of the absolute immunity.

85. B is the correct answer. Aaron is a
republisher. The fact that Clyde did not
believe the statement is not required. It
is sufficient that the person understand
the words as accusing plaintiff of some
disgrace. A is incorrect because Aaron
is not protected by the reporter's privi 
lege. C is incorrect because no condi 
tional privilege is raised by the facts. D
is incorrect for the same reason B is
correct.

86. D is the correct answer. Modernly, a
manufacturer is strictly liable for a
manufacturing defect. A is incorrect
because privity of contract between a
manufacturer and a purchaser is no
longer required. B is incorrect because
a purchaser need not prove negligence
to recover for a personal injury caused
by a dangerously defective product. C
is incorrect because a manufacturing
defect, not a design defect, caused the
injury.

TOOlS II

87. B is the correct answer. Most states to 
day allow bystanders to recover for per 
sonal injuries caused by dangerously
defective products, so long as they were
reasonably foreseeable bystanders. Ais
incorrect because every party in the
manufacturing/marketing chain is liable
for injuries caused by a dangerously
defective product. C is incorrect be 
cause privity is not required. D is in 
correct because a bystander need not be
a family member to recover for personal
injuries.

88. A is the best answer because a plaintiff
may not recover in strict liability in tort,
if the manufacturer can show that the
product has been altered after it leaves
the manufacturer's hands. B is incorrect
because snowmobiles are not inherently
dangerous products, and because
Marlene did not assume the risk that the
product would be defective. C is incor 
rect because the facts do not show that
Marlene's inexperience caused the ac 
cident. D is incorrect because a manu 
facturer is strictly liable, even though it
took all possible care to avoid manu 
facturing defects.

89. C is the correct answer. The Restate 
ment of Torts and the courts recognize
that, although some products pose a risk
of injury, where their utility outweighs
the risk, they are not unreasonably dan 
gerous. Many new drugs fall within this
category. A is incorrect because there
is no manufacturing defect. B is incor 
rect because the design defect is not
unreasonably dangerous. D is incorrect
because drug manufacturers do not have
a blanket exemption from strict liabil 
ity rules.

90. C is the correct answer. An adequate
warning to a "learned intermediary"
(here the doctor) is generally held to be
a warning to the patient. A is incorrect
because in the case of prescription
drugs, the warning need not be directly
to the consumer. B is incorrect because
it overstates the liability of a drug manu 
facturer. D is incorrect because drug
manufacturers do not have a blanket
exemption from strict liability rules.

TCJ'IIS

91. B is the correct answer. The injury was
caused by the carelessness of Blaster
Co. 's employee. A is incorrect because
Susan was not injured as a result of ac 
tivity that was abnormally dangerous.
(Had the container exploded, the result
would be different.) C is incorrect be 
cause injuries caused when a person
falls over a container in a dark aisle are
reasonably foreseeable. D is incorrect
because the facts do not mention a
worker's compensation statute, and also
because these laws usually affect only
those in employer-employee relation 
ships.

92. D is the correct answer. Susan can re 
cover from Rudy because he was neg 
ligent and from Blaster Co. because it
is vicariously liable for the negligence
of its employee. A is incorrect because
Rudy was acting within the scope of his
employment when he was negligent. B
is incorrect for the same reason. C is
incorrect because it states Susan can
recover from Rudy only.

93. B is the correct answer. Since Crispco
used an inadequate wire in all its toast 
ers, this is a design defect that created
an unreasonable risk of danger. A is in 
correct because this is not a manufac 
turing defect. C is incorrect because
whether Crispco warned Arlene or not
is irrelevant. D is incorrect because neg 
ligence might be more difficult to prove,
and because the statement about privity
is incorrect.

94 D is the correct answer. A tort suit is
not an appropriate means of insuring the
quality of a product. A, Band C are all
incorrect because Arlene cannot recover
for loss of the product itself under a tort
theory. If Arlene wants to recover for
pure economic loss, including loss of
the product, she may recover under a
warranty theory, which may include a
suit for breach of implied or express
warranties.

95. D is the correct answer. Generally, a
person has no duty to come to the aid
of one in distress. A is incorrect because
the common law did not recognize a
duty to rescue. B is incorrect because
most states have not changed the com 
mon law rule. C is incorrect because
although the AMA rule is correctly
stated, it has not been applied in tort
cases.

96. C is the correct answer. In a jurisdic 
tion with a Good Samaritan statute, a
physician who administers aid in an
emergency is not liable for mere negli 
gence, but instead must have acted reck 
1essly or willfully and wantonly in caus 
ing an injury. A is incorrect because
Good Samaritan statutes insulate phy 
sicians from liability for negligence in
emergencies. B is incorrect because it
misstates the effect of Good Samaritan
statutes. D is incorrect because Sandra
will not be liable for negligence, as
stated above.

lQilS Em

99. B is the correct answer. Most jurisdic 
tions that recognize a wrongful life
claim limit, recovery to special dam 
ages. A is incorrect because general
damages are not usually allowed. (This
is because a jury cannot determine dam 
ages based on the difference between
non-life and life in an impaired state.)
C is incorrect because it includes gen 
eral damages. D is incorrect because it
includes general damages and punitive
damages, which are generally not avail 
able in negligence cases.

100. C is the correct answer. Although an
attorney usually does not owe a duty
of care to a non-client, an exception
has been recognized in cases where a
specific person is an intended benefi 
ciary of a will. A and B are incorrect
because privity is not universally re 
quired in attorney malpractice cases.
D is incorrect because Fred's recov 
ery will not be limited to the amount
of the fee. He may recover all proxi 
mately caused damages from Wanda
for her negligence.

101. B is the correct answer. A is incorrect,
since it states one of the elements of
negligence which is not necessary, in
strict liability, under 402A. C is incor 
rect because 402A expressly excludes
any requirement of privity. D is incor 
rect because 402A is equally appli 
cable to a lease transaction, although
warranty theories do require a techni 
cal sale.

97. B is the correct answer. When a child
sues a health care provider for damages
caused when the provider negligently
failed to discover a possible birth de 
fect in a fetus, the claim is called a
wrongful life claim. A is incorrect be 
cause wrongful birth is the term used
when a parent sues for damages in the
same circumstances. C is incorrect be 
cause this is plainly not a wrongful
death claim. D is incorrect for the same
reason that B is correct.

98. B is the correct answer. If Clara in 
tended to give birth to Randolph in any
case, Anna was not the cause in fact of
Randolph's birth. A is incorrect because
a health care provider does not cause
the injury in a wrongful life case, but
rather deprives the mother of an oppor 
tunity to end the pregnancy. C is in 
correct because most courts would find
these special damages reasonably fore 
seeable. D is incorrect because a waiver
ofliability in a medical malpractice case
would not be enforced - it violates
public policy.

Em lCJiIS

102. A is the correct answer. A design de 
fect is found when the product is made
avoidable hazard to the user. The es-
sence of design defect is the concept
of unreasonably dangerous, and an
avoidable danger is an unreasonable
danger. B is incorrect because it is a
nonsense statement. A manufacturing
defect is found when the product is not
made as intended. C is incorrect be 
cause a marketing defect is found when
the maker has failed to warn the user
of a danger known to the maker. D is
also a nonsense statement because fab 
rication means the same as manufac 
turing, and if the product was as in 
tended it is not a fabrication or manu 
facturing defect.

103. D is the correct answer. There is a line
of cases which would support the de 
will succeed. A is clearly irrelevant be-
cause knowledge of the hazard is im 
portant to negligence but not necessary
for liability under 402A. B is clearly
erroneous because it is not possible to
disclaim liability under 402A. C is
clearly wrong both factually and le 
gally because Peter was not unreason 
able in driving in traffic and contribu 
tory negligence is not a defense to strict
liability. The theory of D, that the pre 
cipitating cause of the injury was the
negligence of another driver and that
the maker has no duty to create a crash
proof car, has been rejected by a ma 
jority of the courts, but at one time was
a supportable and arguable defense, so
it is the best defense offered.

104. C is the correct answer. Concurrent
tortfeasors always bear the burden of
apportioning loss or they are jointly
and severally liable for the entire loss.
Tera can obviously apportion the prop 
erty damage, but will probably be
jointly and severally liable for all of
Peter's personal injury, at least the pa 
ralysis. A is incorrect because techni 
cally Tetra is liable only for the en 
hanced damages. The question is who
has the burden of apportionment. B is
incorrect because, under the facts, ap 
portionment will be virtually impos 
sible. D is incorrect because Peter does
not have the burden of apportioning
damages caused by joint and concur 
rent tortfeasors at modem law.

lCFCIS II

105. A is the correct answer. The courts
have consistently drawn a line at what
type of damages may be recovered
under negligence and 402A. Damage
caused to persons or property other
than the defective product itself may
be recovered, but any damages other
than that are deemed part of the loss
of the benefit of the bargain. Here, lost
profits clearly are a pure economic
loss, and the cost of replacing the car 
pet is probably also not recoverable
under either of these two theories. B
is wrong because it does not fit within
the concept of damages to persons or
property, other than the defective prod 
uct. C is incorrect because lost profits
from the defective product are clearly
a pure economic loss.

106. D is the correct answer. Since any war 
ranty would permit recovery based on
the "benefit of the bargain", lost prof 
its and expenses of replacing the de 
fective product fit within this concept.
A and B are incorrect for the reasons
expressed in the analysis of question
105. C would permit recovery if it
could be proven, but on these facts
there is no Express Warranty shown.

107. C is the correct answer because an in 
tentional or criminal intervening act is
normally unforeseeable as a matter of
law; however, the defense will fail in
this case, since the arsonist is within
the risk created by the sale of the de 
fective carpet. A is not an arguable
defense, since lack of privity is no
longer a defense in any of the theo 
ries, including horizontal privity, since
Patricia would be covered by all of the
alternatives set forth in the Uniform
Commercial Code. B is not even an
arguable defense, since Prince Hotel's
intervening passive negligence would
not protect Questa. D is not arguable,
since a guest at a hotel is clearly
foreseeably at risk from the defective
product.

108. D is the correct answer, even though
punitive damages are not normally
available in products cases, because
Questa exhibited a callous disregard
for the high probability of injury to
hotel guests and chose to expose them
to the risk to make a little extra profit.
This would be the equivalent of im 
plied Malice and subject Questa to pu 
nitive damages. All other answers are
incorrect because they do not include
punitive damages.

Em TCJ'IIS

109. B is the correct answer. The hotel
would owe Patricia a duty of inspec 
tion to discover defects in the premises.
A is not correct, since 402A is appli 
cable only to a commercial seller of
products. C is incorrect, since 402B
requires a representation and a sale of
a product, neither of which is present
here. D is also incorrect, since it re 
quires a technical sale of a product, al 
though some courts have constructed
a 'hybrid' form of warranty called
"warranty of habitability", which
could conceivably fit this situation, but
only a few courts have adopted it.

110. A is the correct answer. The parties are
not in pari delicto, Prince Hotel being,
at most, only passively negligent. Also,
Questa has breached its implied war 
ranty of merchantability to Prince Ho 
tel. B is not correct, since Prince would
be entitled to indemnity on these facts.
C is not correct, since the doctrine of
equitable apportionment is found in
only a few states.

111. C is the correct answer because Baxter
was aware of the side effect of the drug
in 1986 and marketed the drug with 
out a warning of the hazard after 1986.
A is not correct, since there is no indi 
cation of mismanufacturing. B is not
correct, since the drug clearly passes
the cost/benefit and risk/benefit analy 
ses and is unavoidably hazardous.

112. B is the correct answer. Since A, the
sine qua non test, will not find causa 
tion, according to the experts. She
probably would have gone blind, even
if she had not taken the Betacin. How 
ever, since long term use of the Betacin
would also have caused blindness,
most courts would hold that Betacin
was a substantial factor in causing her
injury and would hold Baxter liable.
Neither C nor D can be correct, since
Pauline does not find it impossible to
prove cause in fact. Both Alternative
liability and Market Share are substi 
tutes for causation when Pauline can 
not prove that the defendant's act
caused the injury, although it could
have.

113. D is the correct answer. Dr. Smith con 
tinued to prescribe the drug even after
the warning was given, and we can in 
fer that he would have done the same
thing had the warning been given ear 
lier. If a warning would not have
changed the plaintiff's actions, then the
warning cannot be the cause in fact.
The other options all contain good ar 
guments why Pauline should have
taken the drug, but in the final analy 
sis whether she exposes herself to the
hazard of the drug, rather than the haz 
ard of the disease, has to be her choice
and she is deprived of this choice by
not being given a warning.

100iS 1m

114. A is the correct answer because
Pauline has the right to decide for her 
self whether to accept the risk of medi 
cal treatment. Band e are clearly
wrong, since they both require sales
of products, which medical doctors do
not engage in. D is incorrect, since
balancing the risks against the benefits
will show that Dr. Smith was not un 
reasonable in subjecting her to the risk
of the drug to avoid the disease.

115. B is the correct answer. Exposure to
any asbestos provided by any of the
many suppliers over the years could
be sufficient to produce asbestosis.
Thus, A is incorrect because, if Ajax's
conduct is removed from the factual
equation, the damage will probably
still occur. e is incorrect, since Pete
can prove that Ajax's conduct was the
cause of his injury, and D is not cor 
rect, since he can identify at least one
of the suppliers. D is also incorrect,
since it would not give him a complete
recovery. Each maker would only have
to pay its percentage of the injury co 
incident with its market share. In the
many decades of exposure, many of
the suppliers will have gone out of
business and can't be held liable for
their percentage.

BllQilS

116. e is the correct answer. Since long
term exposure to asbestos is necessary
for the onset of asbestosis, the fact that
Ajax has only been in the business for
five years may be sufficient to con 
vince a jury that Ajax could not have
been even a substantial factor in Pete's
damage. A is incorrect, since it refers
to D's knowledge of the hazard as a
prerequisite to its duty to warn. A seller
of a product is held to be aware of all
knowledge available in the industry
and the facts indicate that the industry
has been aware of the hazard for sev 
eral decades. B is irrelevant. P is su 
ing for failure to warn, and D is incor 
rect because A and B are incorrect.

117. D is the correct answer. The uee has
provided three alternatives for states
to adopt to permit recovery for con 
sumers who are not in vertical privity
with the manufacturer. The first of
these alternatives would permit recov 
ery by natural persons for personal in 
jury who were members of the
purchaser's family or his guests. Un 
der this alternative, Pete would lack the
requisite horizontal privity for recov 
ery under breach of implied warranty.
A is not correct, since a representation
is not necessary to create an implied
warranty of merchantability. B is not
correct, since, although warranties are
still subject to disclaimer, a disclaimer
for personal injury to a consumer is
prima facie unconscionable. e is not
correct, since vertical privity is no
longer necessary since the decision in
Henningsen.

118. C is the correct answer because her
only damages are to the defective prod 
llrt it<:f"lf llnrl wnlllrl hI" rlf"f"mf"rl nllrf"
the bargain. A and B are not correct,
since both 402A and Negligence
would permit recover only for personal
injury and damage to property other
than the defective product.

119. A is the correct answer because, on
these facts, the only express warranty
was made by Wily Car Co in its tele 
vision ads, and there are no facts show 
ing that Jim adopted the express war 
ranty. Band C are incorrect, since
Patricia has both vertical and horizon 
tal privity with Jim's Offroad Shoppe.
D is incorrect, since Patricia can eas 
ily show a defect under a warranty
theory by showing that the product did
not perform as intended.

120. D is the correct answer. It can be in 
ferred that the transmission was defec-
tivf" hf"rllll<:f" it rlirl nnt nf"rfnrm ~<: it
ipsa is limited to proving breach of
duty in a negligence case and here she
is suing in 402A. B is not correct, since
her expert's opinion, that a missing
spring was "possibly" the cause, does
not meet the minimum standard for the
plaintiff's burden of proof by a pre 
ponderance of the evidence. The me 
chanical engineer would have to tes 
tify that the missing spring was "more
likely than not" the cause, or that it was
"probably" the cause. C comes close
to being correct, but it is merely a state 
ment of the various facts she would
adduce to bolster a circumstantial evi 
dence case by negating other possible
causes of the accident.

121. C is the correct answer. The Evidence
Code specifically excludes such evi 
dence for the reason stated, although a
few courts, including California, have
ruled otherwise with respect to Strict
Liability actions. A is incorrect, since
the facts indicate that Patricia is suing
for negligence in addition to 402A, so
fault is at issue. B is incorrect because
the fact that the evidence would tend
to show that Wily Car Co. felt that the
cast aluminum was not strong enough
for the rigors expected and this would
certainly be relevant to Patricia's claim
that her vehicle failed because of a de 
fective design. D is not correct, since
consciousness of guilt is not a part of
a civil case, and would be barred by
the public policy to encourage safety
measures in any event.

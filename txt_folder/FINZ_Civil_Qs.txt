TORTS QUESTIONS

1. The manufacturer made a product that was sold over the counter for the
treatment of dandruff and dry scalp conditions. A doctor purchased a
bottle at a drugstore. A statement on the label read, “This product will
not harm normal scalp or hair.” The doctor used the product as
directed. Because of a rare scalp condition making him allergic to one
of the ingredients, the product irritated his scalp, causing him much
pain and discomfort. In an action for negligence by the doctor against
the manufacturer, which of the following additional facts or inferences,
if it was the only one true, would be most effective in the
manufacturer's defense?

(A) The doctor did not read the statement on the label.

(B) The reasonable person in the manufacturer's position would not
have foreseen that the product would injure persons with the
doctor's allergy.

(C) The product was manufactured for the manufacturer by another

company.

(D) The manufacturer was unaware that an allergy existed like that

suffered by the doctor.

2. The defendant lived in a neighborhood in which the incidence of

violent crime had been increasing. The plaintiff and the defendant were
having tea together in the defendant's kitchen when there was a knock at
the door of the defendant's home. Although the door was equipped with
a peephole that would have enabled the defendant to see who was

893

outside before opening, the defendant opened the door without looking.
As soon as the door was opened, an armed robber entered with a gun.
The robber struck the plaintiff several times with the barrel of his
pistol before robbing her of her money and leaving. The plaintiff
subsequently asserted a negligence claim against the defendant for
injuries resulting from the attack, alleging that it was negligent for the
defendant to open the door without looking to see who was there.

Which of the following additional facts, if it was the only one true,
would be most helpful to the plaintiff's claim against the defendant?

(A) The defendant was aware of the high incidence of crime in the

neighborhood.

(B) The plaintiff was aware of the high incidence of crime in the

neighborhood.

(C) The defendant had invited the plaintiff for tea because she hoped to

sell the plaintiff her used living room furniture.

(D) One of the defendant's neighbors had been robbed and attacked by

the robber in a similar manner the previous day.

3. A farmer advertised his farm for sale. A developer had been secretly

advised by a friend in the state highway department that a major
highway would soon be built adjacent to the farmer's land. Knowing
that this would increase the value of the property, the developer
contacted the farmer and offered to purchase the farm. The developer
said that she would be willing to pay the fair market value as
determined by any licensed real estate appraiser selected by the
farmer. The farmer hired a licensed real estate appraiser who
determined the fair market value to be $400,000. The developer
purchased the land, paying that price. Under state law, the developer
was required to tell the farmer about the new road, but she failed to do
so.

Three weeks after the closing of title, the state announced plans to
build a highway adjacent to the land. This announcement increased the
value of the land to $4,000,000. If the farmer institutes an action for
misrepresentation against the developer, the court should find for

(A) the developer, because the farmer knew her to be a real estate

investor.

894

(B) the developer, because she allowed the farmer's appraiser to

determine the fair market value of the land.

(C) the farmer, because the developer's failure to disclose the coming

of the highway was a breach of a fiduciary obligation.

(D) the farmer, because the developer had an obligation to disclose that

the state would be building a highway adjacent to the land.

4. A woman was injured when a robber shot her with a pistol

manufactured by the gun maker. She asserted a claim against the gun
maker, alleging that the pistol with which she had been shot was meant
to be sold for a price under $50. Which of the following arguments is
most likely to lead to a judgment for the woman?

(A) The gun maker is vicariously liable for battery, since it was

foreseeable that a purchaser of the pistol would shoot another
person with it.

(B) The gun maker breached an implied warranty that the gun was

merchantable, since a pistol that is meant to be sold for under $50
is unfit for ordinary use.

(C) The gun maker is liable for negligence, since the criminal law is

designed to protect persons like the woman from becoming the
victims of robbers.

(D) The gun maker is liable for negligence, since the low selling price

of the pistol made it foreseeable that it would be used in
connection with a crime.

5. A man was already intoxicated when he entered the bartender's tavern.
At first, the bartender refused to serve him any more alcohol. The man
insisted, however, and at his insistence, the bartender served him more
drinks. When the man left the bar, he was unable to start his car. He
asked a dentist, who was driving by, to assist him. The dentist, who
realized that the man was drunk, determined that the man's battery was
weak and started the man's car by connecting a cable to her own
battery. Later, while driving, the man struck a pedestrian who was
walking across the street.

The pedestrian asserted a claim for his personal injuries against the
dentist. Which one of the following facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would provide the dentist with the most effective
defense?

895

(A) The state had a statute making a barkeeper liable for damage done
by a person who purchased alcohol from the barkeeper after
already being intoxicated.

(B) The dentist was in the business of rendering road service to

motorists having trouble with their cars.

(C) The man drove 200 miles before striking the pedestrian.

(D) The man would not have struck the pedestrian if he had not been

intoxicated.

6. The driver was driving at an unreasonably fast rate of speed when, as a

result, he collided with a hunter's car that was standing unattended
against the curb. The impact caused a loaded rifle that the hunter had
left in the back seat of the car to fire. The bullet went through the car
window and traveled four blocks before striking a painter, who was
leaving a paint factory after work. Although the painter had lost the
sight in his left eye in an accident that occurred when he was a child,
he was employed by the paint factory as a color coordinator. As a
result of his being struck by the bullet from the hunter's rifle, the painter
lost the sight in his right eye. This rendered him totally blind, causing
him to lose his job. The painter subsequently asserted a negligence
claim against the driver, alleging permanent loss of earning capacity in
addition to other items of damage.

Which of the following is the driver's most effective argument in
defense against the painter's claim for permanent loss of earning
capacity?

(A) The painter was a super-sensitive plaintiff, since he was already

blind in one eye.

(B) The hunter acted unreasonably by leaving a loaded rifle in the back

seat of his car.

(C) The painter was outside the foreseeable zone of danger.

(D) The reasonable person would not have expected that the driver's

conduct would cause any person to be rendered blind.

7. A burglar broke into the grocer's grocery store in the middle of the
night. After stealing all the money that was in the cash register, she
blew open the door of the safe with nitroglycerin and stole its contents
as well. Then, as she was leaving, she stole a six-pack of beer.

896

Because of poor quality control at the brewery, the beer contained a
toxic ingredient. Later that night, the burglar drank the beer and was
made seriously ill by the toxic ingredient that it contained. In an action
by the burglar against the brewery, the court will most likely find for

(A) the burglar, because her injury was proximately caused by the

negligence of the brewery.

(B) the burglar, since the brewery breached an express warranty.

(C) the brewery, since the burglar does not come into court with “clean

hands.”

(D) the brewery, because the burglar's theft of the beer will be regarded

as unforeseeable.

8. A movie studio was filming part of a motion picture at a large

residential apartment building with the permission of the building
owner. To avoid interference by curious onlookers, the movie studio's
security agents set up a command post in the lobby of the building. No
persons were allowed to enter the building without identifying
themselves and explaining their reasons for being there. A fisherman,
who lived in an apartment in the building, was returning from a fishing
trip late one night. Unaware of the movie studio's activities, he was
stopped by the movie studio employees as he attempted to enter.
Because he was not carrying identification, the fisherman was unable
to establish his identity. For this reason, the employees refused to
allow him to enter. After trying unsuccessfully to convince them that he
lived there, the fisherman stayed with his sister, who lived a block
away. The following morning, he contacted the building owner, who
spoke to the movie studio officials and arranged to have them allow the
fisherman to enter.

If the fisherman asserts a claim against the movie studio for false
imprisonment, which of the following would be the movie studio's
most effective argument in defense?

(A) The movie studio employees did not know that the fisherman was

entitled to enter the building.

(B) The conduct of the movie studio employees was not unreasonable.

(C) The fisherman was not imprisoned.

(D) The fisherman sustained no damage as a result of the conduct of the

897

movie studio employees.

9. A handyman, who owned an appliance repair shop, was at a cocktail

party when he saw one of his competitors. When the handyman
suggested that they work together, the competitor responded, “I
wouldn't go into business with you because you're the most
incompetent person I've ever known.” A customer of the handyman's
overheard the conversation. As a result, the following day the customer
cancelled a contract that he had with the handyman.

If the handyman asserts a claim against the competitor for defamation,
the handyman will be successful if

(A) the competitor knew or should have known that the statement was

defamatory when he made it.

(B) the competitor knew or should have known that the statement was

false when he made it.

(C) the competitor knew or should have known that the statement would

be overheard when he made it.

(D) the competitor knew or should have known that harm would result

from the statement.

10. A farmer agreed to deliver all of her wheat to a bread company to be

used by that company in the production of bread for sale to the general
public. While harvesting the crop, she realized that a blade on her
harvesting machine was broken and that fine slivers of metal were
becoming mixed with the wheat. She said nothing about this when she
delivered the wheat to the bread company since she knew that the
bread company ordinarily cleaned its wheat before using it. The
harvesting machine had been manufactured and sold by a tractor
company.

The bread company used the wheat that it purchased from the farmer to
manufacture a loaf of bread that it sold to a deli owner who operated a
sandwich shop. The deli owner used the bread to make a sandwich.
Because the bread contained slivers of the blade from the farmer's
harvesting machine, a bike messenger lacerated the lining of his throat
when he swallowed a bite of the sandwich.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most helpful to the farmer in defense against

898

an action brought by the bike messenger on a theory of strict liability
in tort?

(A) If the bread company acted reasonably, the slivers of metal would
have been removed from the wheat before it was baked into bread.

(B) The sandwich that contained the slivers of metal had been

purchased by one of the bike messenger's coworkers, who gave it
to the bike messenger after changing his mind about eating it.

(C) The bread company made substantial changes to the wheat.

(D) The blade on the farmer's harvesting machine was defective when

she purchased it from the tractor company.

11. The plaintiff and the defendant were drinking at the same bar when the
plaintiff began insulting the defendant by calling him names that were
ethnically offensive. When they started to argue with each other, the
bartender asked them both to leave. The plaintiff got into his car and
drove away. Angry, the defendant began chasing him in his own car.
When he caught up with the plaintiff, the defendant began passing the
plaintiff's car on the left. As he did so, he swerved his car toward the
plaintiff's for the purpose of frightening the plaintiff. The plaintiff did
not know that the car swerving toward him was the defendant's, but he
became frightened that it would hit him and steered away from it,
striking a fire hydrant and sustaining injury.

If the plaintiff institutes an action against the defendant, a court should
hold the defendant liable for

(A) battery only.

(B) assault only.

(C) both battery and assault.

(D) neither battery nor assault.

12. The buyer was interested in purchasing the seller's house. Because the
buyer knew that some of the houses in the area were infested with
termites, he asked the seller whether there were any termites in his
house. The seller said that there were none, believing this statement to
be true. The buyer purchased the house from the seller and moved into
it. Three months later, the buyer discovered that the framework of the
house had been damaged by termites, and that the termites had been
damaging the framework for several years. He subsequently asserted a

899

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

claim against the seller on a theory of negligent misrepresentation.

Which of the following is the seller's most effective argument in
defense against the buyer's claim?

(A) The seller did not know that there were termites in the house.

(B) The seller had no duty to tell the buyer whether there were termites

in the house.

(C) The seller's statement that there were no termites in the house was

an expression of opinion.

(D) The seller's belief that there were no termites in the house was

reasonable.

13. The plaintiff purchased a box labeled “Generic Breakfast Cereal” from
a supermarket. While he was eating it, he broke a tooth on a stone that
the product contained. The product sold by the supermarket and
labeled “Generic Breakfast Cereal” is furnished by three different
manufacturers. Each sells an approximately equal quantity to the
supermarket. In addition, all package their product in identical
wrappers, so that it is impossible to tell which of them furnished any
given box of breakfast cereal. Although the companies compete with
each other, at the supermarket's request, they worked together to design
the product wrapper.

If the plaintiff is successful in an action for damages against the
supermarket, it will probably be because

(A) the supermarket and manufacturers were involved in a concerted

action in the manufacture and marketing of the product.

(B) the supermarket and manufacturers established standards on an
industry-wide basis, which standards made identification of the
product's manufacturer impossible.

(C) the negligence of any of the three manufacturers resulted in harm to
the plaintiff under circumstances such that it was impossible to tell
which of them caused the harm, and the supermarket is vicariously
liable for that negligence.

(D) any of the three manufacturers manufactured a defective product,
and the supermarket sold that product while it was in a defective
condition.

14. A young girl planned to spend an entire weekend camping alone in the
woods. A kidnapper, who knew about the girl's plan, phoned the girl's
mother the day after the girl left home. The kidnapper said, “We have
your daughter. We've already beaten her up once, just to hear her
scream. Next time, we might kill her.” The kidnapper instructed the
girl's mother to deliver a cash ransom to a specified location within
one hour. Since there was no way to locate the girl's campsite in the
woods, the girl's mother could not find out whether the kidnapper was
telling the truth. Horrified that her daughter might be beaten and injured
or killed, she delivered the ransom as instructed. She remained in a
hysterical state until the girl returned from her camping trip and the
girl's mother realized that the ransom demand had been a hoax. The
girl's mother, who already suffered from a heart ailment, had a heart
attack the day after the girl's return.

If the girl's mother asserts a claim against the kidnapper for assault, the
court should find for

(A) the girl's mother, because the kidnapper was aware that his conduct

would frighten her.

(B) the girl's mother, because the court will transfer the kidnapper's

intent.

(C) the kidnapper, because the girl's mother did not perceive injury

being inflicted upon the girl.

(D) the kidnapper, because the girl's mother had no reason to expect to

be touched by the kidnapper.

15. An actor owned a leopard, which the actor had trained and which had
appeared with him in motion pictures. The leopard had always been
tame and gentle, even when young. When the actor retired, the leopard
was old, almost blind, somewhat slow-moving, and the size of a large
dog. The actor brought the animal to live with him, keeping it in the
fenced yard alongside his house. A young girl delivered newspapers to
the actor. One day, she came to the actor's home to collect for the past
week's deliveries. Since she knew the leopard, the girl opened the gate
and called the animal so that she could pet him. The leopard bounded
toward the place from which the sound had come, but because he was
almost blind, he bumped into the girl. The girl fell to the ground,
fracturing her ankle.

901

If the girl asserts a claim against the actor on a theory of strict liability,
the court should find for

(A) the actor, because the injury did not result from a trait that made it

dangerous to keep a leopard.

(B) the actor, because the leopard was not a wild animal.

(C) the girl, because it was unreasonable for the actor to keep the

leopard in his yard.

(D) the girl, because the actor should have anticipated that a child

would attempt to pet the leopard.

16. While the plaintiff was visiting her daughter, the two of them decided
to go swimming at a nearby public pool. Since she had not brought a
bathing suit along on her visit, the plaintiff went to a department store
to purchase one. While looking at the suits on the bargain counter, she
found one that had been manufactured by the defendant. The package
that contained it bore a label that read, “Disposable Bathing Suit. This
garment is made completely from recycled paper. Although it is strong
enough to be worn several times and is even washable, it's inexpensive
enough to be thrown away after one use. Buy several, and take them
with you on trips to the beach.” The plaintiff bought the bathing suit and
wore it at the public swimming pool. After swimming for a few
minutes, the wet paper bathing suit suddenly dissolved and fell from
her in shreds, leaving her completely naked.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from her embarrassment, the defendant's best argument in
defense is that

(A) the defendant made no representations to the plaintiff.

(B) the plaintiff sustained no physical injury or symptoms.

(C) the plaintiff purchased the suit from the department store.

(D) the defendant acted reasonably in manufacturing and labeling the

bathing suit.

17. A mother needed butter for the cookies that she was baking, so she

asked her seven-year-old son to go to the store. Because traffic was
sometimes heavy, the boy was not usually permitted to ride his bicycle
on the roadway there. The mother needed the butter right away,
however, so she told him that he could ride in the roadway if he was

902

sure to stay on the left side. A driver was driving his car when he was
momentarily blinded by the sun. He did not see the boy, who was
riding toward him in the roadway, and struck him, causing the boy to
sustain serious injuries. The boy subsequently asserted a claim for
negligence against the driver. The driver raised a defense based on
contributory negligence. In a jurisdiction that applies the all-or-nothing
rule of contributory negligence, the driver's defense will succeed only
if

(A) the boy acted unreasonably.

(B) the mother acted unreasonably.

(C) either the mother or the boy acted unreasonably.

(D) both the mother and the boy acted unreasonably.

18. A company manufactured a leash for training dogs. The leash had been

submitted to all reasonable tests and inspections before being
marketed. A professional dog trainer was working with a dog in her
unfenced front yard and was using a brand new leash. The dog was of
average size and strength. A walker was walking past the yard when
the dog began to snarl and lunge at him. When the trainer yanked on the
leash, it suddenly broke, freeing the dog. The dog sprang forward,
biting the walker.

If the walker asserts a claim against the company alleging that the
leash used by the trainer was defective, the court should find for

(A) the company, because the walker was not a purchaser or consumer

of the product.

(B) the company, because the leash had been submitted to all
reasonable tests and inspections before being marketed.

(C) the walker, because the dog was a dog of average size and strength.

(D) the walker, because it was foreseeable that the leash would

eventually weaken and break when used as it was meant to be used.

19. On a boy's first birthday, his aunt bought him a rag doll as a gift. The
toy was made of plush material, with buttons sewn on for eyes. While
playing with the toy, the boy pulled one of the buttons off, put it in his
mouth, and choked to death on it. The boy's father commenced an
action against the aunt under the state's wrongful death statute.

903

If the father is successful in his action against the aunt, it will probably
be because

(A) the aunt was negligent in giving the rag doll to the boy.

(B) the rag doll was unfit for ordinary use.

(C) the rag doll was defective when the aunt gave it to the boy.

(D) the rag doll was unreasonably dangerous when the aunt gave it to

the boy.

20. Because the plaintiff had a headache, he took two headache tablets

from a bottle that had been purchased by his wife at the grocery store.
The tablets had been manufactured by the company, which sold them to
the grocery store in sealed bottles for resale. Because of a toxic
ingredient that the tablets contained, the plaintiff became ill as a result
of taking them.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim based on negligence against the grocery
store for his damages, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the company's negligence is imputed to the

grocery store.

(B) the plaintiff, because a retailer has an absolute duty to provide safe

products.

(C) the grocery store, because the bottle containing the tablets was

sealed when the grocery store received it.

(D) the grocery store, because the tablets had been purchased by the

plaintiff's wife.

21. A driver was looking for an address as he drove down the street and
was not watching the road in front of him. As a result, he did not see
the pedestrian crossing the street in front of him and struck her with his
car, knocking her down. The driver immediately got out of his car to
help the pedestrian. When he saw that she was unconscious, he became
afraid to move her, and he left her in the roadway while he ran to a
nearby phone. While the driver was gone, a taxi driver drove down the
same street. Because he was intoxicated by the drug PCP, the taxi
driver did not see the pedestrian in the roadway and drove over her,
fracturing her leg.

If the pedestrian brings an action against the taxi driver for damages

904

resulting from her fractured leg, the taxi driver's liability will most
probably turn on whether it was foreseeable that

(A) the driver would drive negligently and would leave the pedestrian

lying in the roadway after striking her.

(B) a person struck by an automobile would be involved in a second

accident within a short period of time.

(C) a person would be in the roadway.

(D) the taxi driver would drive while intoxicated by the drug PCP.

22. The power company operated a nuclear power plant on the seashore
just outside the city and sold electricity generated by its operations to
city residents. To cool its equipment, the power company drew water
from the ocean and piped it through portions of its plant. Because this
operation made the water highly radioactive, the power company
stored used water in a series of large concrete holding ponds. The
water stored in this fashion was subjected to a series of procedures
designed to “neutralize” it by removing the radioactivity before it was
returned to the ocean. Because of an earthquake, one of the concrete
holding ponds cracked, permitting several million gallons of
neutralized water to escape. Although the escaping water was not
radioactive, it caused substantial damage to the fields of a farmer as it
passed over them.

If the farmer asserts a claim against the power company for damage to
his realty, the court should find for

(A) the farmer, because operating a nuclear power plant is an

abnormally dangerous activity.

(B) the farmer, because water is a substance that is likely to do great

harm if it should escape from captivity.

(C) the farmer, because it was unreasonable to operate a nuclear power

plant in an area where an earthquake could occur.

(D) the power company, because the damage resulted from an Act of

God.

23. The company was a manufacturer of explosives. Its warehouse, which
contained large quantities of explosives, was located a short distance
from the town. A group of political extremists were planning to set off
a series of bombs in public places in the town. Several members broke

905

into the company's warehouse for the purpose of stealing explosives to
use in making bombs. Their entry set off an alarm that brought the
police. Rather than surrender to the police, the terrorists committed
suicide by detonating the explosives that they had stolen. The blast
caused the entire warehouse to explode. A house located a half mile
away was damaged by the explosion.

If the homeowner asserts a claim for damages against the company on
the ground that storing explosives was an abnormally dangerous
activity, which of the following would be the company's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) The explosion did not result from unreasonable conduct by the

company.

(B) The damage did not result from a physical invasion of the

homeowner's realty by any tangible object in the control of the
company.

(C) The conduct of the terrorists was an intervening cause of harm.

(D) It was not foreseeable that terrorists would deliberately detonate

explosives in the warehouse.

24. The seller kept an antique hay wagon in front of her house as a yard
ornament. On several occasions, she offered to sell the hay wagon to
her neighbor, the buyer, for $500. Although the buyer admired it, he had
always been unwilling to pay the seller's price. After reading a
magazine article about the increasing popularity of farm antiques, the
buyer concluded that the value of the seller's hay wagon was likely to
increase, and that it would therefore be a good investment. One day he
approached her, saying, “If you're still interested in selling that hay
wagon, I'll pay $500.” The seller was surprised that he had changed
his mind, but did not ask him why because she was afraid that he
would change it back again. Instead, she said, “I'll take your offer,” and
sold him the wagon. Two months later, an antique dealer who saw the
wagon in the buyer's yard bought it from him for $2,000.

If the seller asserts a misrepresentation claim against the buyer, the
court should find for

(A) the seller, because the buyer knew more about the value of antique

hay wagons than the seller did.

906

(B) the seller, because the buyer purchased the hay wagon for the

undisclosed purpose of profiting from his investment.

(C) the buyer, because he was not required to disclose his purpose in

purchasing the hay wagon.

(D) the buyer, because the seller was initially satisfied with the price

that the buyer paid her for the hay wagon.

25. A state statute provides that no person shall transport passengers for

hire in an airplane unless that person shall be licensed as a commercial
airplane pilot. A pilot owned a small private airplane but did not have
a commercial pilot's license. A businessman offered the pilot $200 to
fly him to a distant city in the pilot's plane. The pilot agreed, after
informing the businessman that he did not have a commercial pilot's
license as required by law. While they were flying over another city,
the pilot realized that he had miscalculated the amount of fuel that he
needed for the trip. As a result, he was forced to land at the other city's
airport. After landing and while waiting to be refueled, the pilot's
plane was struck by a plane that was being negligently operated by
another pilot. The first pilot and the businessman were both injured in
the collision. The jurisdiction applies the all-or-nothing rule of
contributory negligence.

The businessman asserted a claim against the first pilot, alleging that
the first pilot was negligent in miscalculating the quantity of fuel
needed to make the trip. Which of the following arguments would be
the first pilot's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The businessman assumed the risk, because he knew that the first

pilot did not have a commercial pilot's license.

(B) The businessman was contributorily negligent in accepting a ride

with the first pilot, whom he knew to be unlicensed.

(C) The first pilot's miscalculation was not a legal cause of the injury
sustained by the businessman, because the first pilot's plane was
safely on the ground when struck by the plane operated by the
second pilot.

(D) The first pilot's miscalculation was not a factual cause of the injury
sustained by the businessman, because the harm would not have
occurred if the second pilot had not been negligent.

26. A manufacturer made a colorless alcohol used by physicians for

907

cleaning the skin of patients before administering injections. Another of
its products was a red liquid for cleaning glass microscope slides used
in medical and research laboratories.

Because the slide cleaner contained a strong solvent that was
damaging to human skin, the label normally affixed to bottles in which
it was sold contained language advising users to wear rubber gloves
while handling the product.

As a result of an oversight at the company's plant, skin cleaner labels
were erroneously placed on several bottles of slide cleaner. One of
the mislabeled bottles was delivered to a doctor's office. In giving an
injection to a patient, the doctor used the slide cleaner, believing it to
be the skin cleaner. As a result, the patient sustained damage to his
skin.

In a negligence action by the patient against the manufacturer, if one of
the following facts or inferences were true, which would provide the
manufacturer with its strongest argument in defense?

(A) It was unforeseeable that a doctor with the doctor's training and

experience would mistake the chemicals, since they were two
different colors.

(B) If the doctor had been acting reasonably, she would have realized

that the product that she was using was not the skin cleaner, since it
was red instead of colorless.

(C) The doctor's failure to notice that the product that she was using

was red, and therefore was not the skin cleaner, amounted to gross
negligence.

(D) The doctor's conduct was an intervening cause of the patient's

injury.

27. Which of the following persons is most likely to recover in an action

against the manufacturer of a hypodermic needle?

(A) A doctor's child, who found the needle in the doctor's medical bag
and was injured when a defect caused it to break while the child
was playing with it.

(B) A doctor's patient, who was injured when a defect caused the
needle to break while the doctor was injecting him with it.

908

(C) A dentist, who lost profits when she was unable to inject a patient

with the needle because a defect caused it to break.

(D) A narcotics addict, who contracted hepatitis because the needle

was infected with the microbe that caused that disease.

28. A crop duster sprayed insecticides onto growing crops from an

airplane that she flew within 15 feet of the ground. In locating the
fields of her customers, she used a map that the county published for
that purpose and that identified every parcel of real estate in the area
by a parcel number. A farmer hired the crop duster to spray his fields
with insecticide. The farmer knew that his farm was identified on the
county map as parcel 612, but by mistake he told the crop duster that it
was parcel 621. As a result, the crop duster sprayed the farm that the
county map identified as parcel 621. That farm belonged to a gardener,
who had contracted to grow his crop without chemical insecticides and
to sell it to an organic produce distributor. As a result of the crop
duster's spraying, the gardener was unable to fulfill his contract and
sustained serious economic losses.

If the gardener asserts a claim against the crop duster for damages
resulting from trespass to land, the court should find for

(A) the gardener, because crop dusting is an abnormally dangerous

activity.

(B) the gardener, because the crop duster intentionally flew through the

airspace above his land.

(C) the crop duster, because she reasonably believed that the farm that

she was spraying belonged to the farmer.

(D) the crop duster, because there was no damage to the gardener's

land.

29. A state senator was chair of a committee looking into accusations of
corruption in the governor's office. Because reports of committee
agents were beginning to indicate that there was a sound basis for the
accusations, the senator kept them locked in her office safe to prevent
them from becoming public knowledge before the investigation could
be completed. A reporter broke into the senator's office, picked the
lock on her safe, and photographed the documents that it contained. The
following day, realizing that the security of the documents had been
compromised, the senator conducted a press conference in which she

909

made their contents known. Before she had completed the conference,
however, newspapers containing the reporter's story about the papers
in the senator's safe were being sold.

If the senator instituted an action against the reporter for invasion of
privacy, the court should find for

(A) the reporter, since the documents in the senator's safe were

newsworthy.

(B) the reporter, since he was protected by the First Amendment to the

United States Constitution.

(C) the reporter, since the senator made the documents a matter of

public record at the press conference.

(D) the senator, since the reporter entered her office without her

permission and broke into her safe.

30. A boy, who was 11 years of age, was playing with the plaintiff, who

was 10 years of age. While they were playing together, the boy offered
to show the plaintiff his new air rifle. The air rifle was manufactured
by a local company. The boy purchased it from the defendant with
money that he earned by mowing the lawns of several of his neighbors.
While demonstrating the air rifle to the plaintiff, the boy accidentally
shot him with it, severely injuring the plaintiff's eye. The plaintiff
subsequently asserted a negligence claim against the defendant.

If the plaintiff is successful in his claim against the defendant, it will
be because a jury finds that

(A) any negligence by the company in the design of the air rifle should

be imputed to the defendant.

(B) the air rifle was defectively designed.

(C) the air rifle was defectively manufactured.

(D) it was unreasonable for the defendant to sell the air rifle to the boy.

31. A car dealer used a mechanic for all of his auto repairs. He used the
mechanic because he was cheap, although the car dealer sometimes
had to send cars back for repairs three or four times until the mechanic
got it right. One of the car dealer's cars had a leaking carburetor, which
the car dealer knew made it unsafe to drive. He had it repaired by the
mechanic and then rented the car to the plaintiff. One hour later, while

910

the plaintiff was driving the car, the carburetor began leaking again. As
a result, the car exploded, injuring the plaintiff.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the car dealer, the plaintiff's most
effective argument in support of her claim would be that

(A) the car dealer is vicariously liable for the negligence of his

employee.

(B) the duty to maintain a safe car was non-delegable.

(C) the mechanic was an independent contractor.

(D) it was unreasonable for the car dealer to hire the mechanic to

repair the car.

32. Which statement most correctly completes the following sentence? A

retailer owes its customers

(A) no duty to inspect products furnished by reputable manufacturers.

(B) a duty to inspect the packages of all products sold, but no duty to

inspect the contents of those packages.

(C) a duty to inspect only those products that are furnished by

manufacturers whose products are not well known to the retailer.

(D) a duty to make a reasonable inspection of all products that are sold

by that retailer.

33. After an employee's resignation, the employer wrote him a letter in
which he said, “You were never any good as a mechanic, and in
addition, you were the most dishonest employee this company ever
had.” These statements were false. The employee's mother, who lived
with the employee and frequently opened his mail, read the letter as
soon as it arrived. In an action by the employee against the employer
for defamation, a court should find for

(A) the employee, because the employer's statements were published to

the employee's mother.

(B) the employee, only if the employer had reason to know that

someone other than the employee would open and read the letter.

(C) the employer, because the statements contained in the letter were

communicated only to the employee.

(D) the employer, because of the employer's privilege.

911

34. A pilot was injured when the helicopter that he was flying ran out of
fuel and fell from the air. The day after the pilot purchased the
helicopter, he noticed that the fuel gauge gave incorrect readings. He
complained to an officer of the helicopter maker, who told him to have
it fixed and to send the helicopter maker the bill. A week before the
accident, the pilot hired an independent mechanic to repair the fuel
gauge. The mechanic worked on the gauge but failed to repair it
properly. The day before the accident, the pilot's partner flew the
helicopter, using most of the fuel in the tank. Although the pilot's
partner noticed that the fuel gauge continued to indicate that the tank
was full, he neither mentioned it to the pilot nor replaced the fuel in the
tank. On the day of the accident, the fuel gauge indicated that the tank
was full, although it was actually almost empty.

If the pilot wishes to assert a claim for damages on a theory of strict
liability in tort, he is most likely to recover against

(A) the helicopter maker only.

(B) the helicopter maker and the pilot's partner only.

(C) the helicopter maker and the mechanic only.

(D) the helicopter maker, the pilot's partner, and the mechanic.

35. A gravel pit owner was aware of the fact that neighborhood children
used a steep slope on his realty for sledding during the snow season,
and he feared that one of the children would be injured by sledding
onto the public road adjacent to the property. Although he could have
prevented this from happening by erecting a small fence at a cost of
under $200, the gravel pit owner was unwilling to expend that sum.
Instead, he posted a sign that read, “No Sledding, Keep Out.” Three
weeks later, an eight-year-old boy was sledding down the hill on the
gravel pit owner's property when his sled coasted onto the adjacent
public road. The boy sustained serious injuries when he was struck by
a car.

If the boy asserts a negligence claim against the gravel pit owner, the
court should find for

(A) the boy, because danger invites rescue.

(B) the boy, if the gravel pit owner's failure to erect a fence to prevent

the accident was unreasonable.

912

(C) the gravel pit owner, because the car driver had the last clear

chance to avoid injuring the boy.

(D) the gravel pit owner, if the car driver's conduct was an intervening

cause of harm.

36. The seller knew that his car's engine was cracked. Because he wanted
to sell the car, he filled the crack with putty and painted it so that the
crack would not show. Then he brought the car to the buyer, a used car
dealer, and offered to sell it for $1,000 cash. The buyer placed the car
on a lift so that he could inspect it from underneath. He noticed the
filled crack but thought that he would be able to resell the car in spite
of it. The buyer offered $500, which the seller accepted. The next day,
the buyer was showing the car to a customer when the crack caused the
engine to explode, necessitating $500 in repairs and injuring the
customer.

If the buyer institutes an action against the seller for misrepresentation,
which of the following would be the seller's most effective argument
in defense?

(A) The seller made no representation concerning the engine.

(B) The buyer did not rely on the seller's representations concerning the

engine.

(C) The buyer was not justified in relying on the seller's representations

concerning the engine.

(D) The buyer did not sustain damage.

37. A driver stepped on his brake pedal. Because the brakes were not
working properly, he could not stop, and he continued into an
intersection. A second driver saw the first driver go through the red
light. Because the light was green in his favor, however, the second
driver did not stop; he continued into the intersection, believing that he
could avoid striking the first driver by steering around him. The two
vehicles collided in the intersection. The jurisdiction has a statute that
prohibits entering an intersection against a red traffic signal light and
another statute that adopts the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence.

In an action by the second driver against the first driver, the court
should find for

913

(A) the first driver, since the second driver had the last clear chance to

avoid the accident.

(B) the first driver, because it was unreasonable for the second driver

to enter the intersection when he did.

(C) the second driver, because the first driver's violation of statute was

a substantial factor in producing the damage.

(D) the second driver, since the first driver's conduct was negligence

per se.

38. A store owner wrote on a refrigerator “AS IS — $25.” A customer
bought the refrigerator. As she was loading it onto the customer's
pickup truck, the store owner said, “I hope you know that this
refrigerator doesn't work.” The customer said that he did. When the
customer got the refrigerator home, he plugged it in and received a
severe electrical shock while attempting to open its door.

In an action by the customer against the store owner for damages
resulting from his injury, the court will probably find for

(A) the customer, because it was unreasonable for the store owner to
sell the refrigerator without warning him about the wiring defect.

(B) the customer, since the refrigerator was unfit for ordinary use.

(C) the store owner, since the customer purchased the refrigerator “AS

IS.”

(D) the store owner, because the customer had the “last clear chance”

to avoid being injured.

39. The plaintiff was hunting on the defendant's land. The defendant told
the plaintiff to leave, but the plaintiff refused to do so. The defendant
then placed his hand on the plaintiff's chest and pushed him gently
backward, repeating his demand that the plaintiff leave. The plaintiff
shoved the defendant away from him and pointed his shotgun at the
defendant. The defendant immediately drew a pistol and fired at the
plaintiff, striking him in the arm and causing him to drop his shotgun.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for battery, the
court should find for

(A) the defendant, because he fired at the plaintiff to defend his realty

against a trespass.

914

(B) the defendant, because he fired at the plaintiff to defend himself

against the plaintiff's threat with the shotgun.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant struck the first blow.

(D) the plaintiff, because the defendant did not use force against him

until his entry onto the realty was complete.

40. A man kept a wildcat he had tamed as a pet. His neighbor was walking
past the man's house when the wildcat tore through a window screen,
jumped into the street, and attacked the neighbor, seriously injuring
him. The neighbor subsequently asserted a claim against the man for
his damages.

If the neighbor is successful in his claim against the man, it will
probably be because

(A) the neighbor's damages resulted from the man's keeping a wild

animal.

(B) it was foreseeable that the wildcat would do something

unforeseeable.

(C) the thing speaks for itself (res ipsa loquitur).

(D) the man's keeping the wildcat amounted to a private nuisance.

41. A company manufactured a safety helmet in hopes of selling it to the
military for general utility purposes, but it was unsuccessful in doing
so. Instead, it sold the helmets to the general public. The helmets were
packaged in boxes that showed pictures of three persons wearing the
helmet: one riding a horse, one riding a motorcycle, and one doing
construction work. A motorcyclist found a helmet that someone had
discarded in its original box. He wore it the next day while riding his
motorcycle and sustained a severe head injury when he fell.

The motorcyclist asserted a claim against the company for his injuries
in a jurisdiction that has adopted a rule of “pure comparative
negligence.” At the trial, the motorcyclist proved that the helmet was
not suitable for use as a motorcycle helmet, and that if it had been, he
would not have sustained injury.

The court should find for

(A) the company, because the motorcyclist found the helmet.

915

(B) the company, if the helmets were not designed or intended for use

as motorcycle helmets.

(C) the motorcyclist, unless his fall from the motorcycle resulted from

his own unreasonable conduct.

(D) the motorcyclist, because the box in which the helmet was sold

contained a picture of a person wearing the helmet while riding a
motorcycle.

42. When the owner brought his car to the mechanic's shop for repairs, the
mechanic told him that he would test-drive the car after repairing it.
While the mechanic was test-driving the car, he struck a pedestrian. A
statute in the jurisdiction provides that “The owner of any motor
vehicle operated on the roads of this state shall be vicariously liable
for the negligence of any person operating said motor vehicle with said
owner's permission.” The pedestrian instituted an action against the
owner and the mechanic and obtained a judgment against both of them
for $10,000.

If the owner pays the judgment in full, which of the following is
correct regarding the owner's rights against the mechanic?

(A) The owner may recover $10,000 from the mechanic.

(B) The owner may recover $5,000 from the mechanic.

(C) The owner may recover $7,500 from the mechanic.

(D) The owner may not recover from the mechanic.

43. A breeder of exotic birds preferred to mix feed for his birds according
to his own formula instead of using commercially available mixes. For
this purpose, he purchased a sealed 50-pound package of seeds from
the dealer, who was in the business of selling supplies for bird and
livestock breeders. The dealer had bought the sealed package from the
wholesaler, a wholesaler of seed and grain. Because of negligence at
the wholesaler's plant, the seeds in the package were poisonous. The
breeder fed the seeds to several of his birds, which died as a result.

If the breeder brings an action in strict liability against the wholesaler
for the value of the birds that died, a court is most likely to find for

(A) the breeder, because the poisonous nature of the seeds was a

defect.

916

(B) the breeder, because it was reasonable for the dealer to resell the

seeds without inspection.

(C) the wholesaler, since the wholesaler had no contractual

relationship with the breeder.

(D) the wholesaler, because the breeder will be unable to recover

damages from the dealer.

44. Although he had been warned that swimming within one hour after

eating was likely to cause a cramp, a swimmer went swimming in the
lake immediately after lunch. He had been swimming for a few minutes
when he developed severe cramps. Finding himself unable to swim any
further, he began calling for help. The swimmer's cries attracted the
attention of a rescuer, who happened to be walking near the lake. The
rescuer jumped into the water, swam to the swimmer's side, and,
grabbing the swimmer by the hair, towed him to safety. In getting out of
the lake, however, the rescuer cut his leg on a fragment of glass that
was embedded in the lake bottom.

If the rescuer asserts an action against the swimmer for personal
injuries, the court should find for

(A) the rescuer, because it was negligent for the swimmer to swim so

soon after eating.

(B) the rescuer, because his injury occurred while he was attempting to

rescue the swimmer.

(C) the swimmer, because danger invites rescue.

(D) the swimmer, because the glass fragment is an intervening cause of

the rescuer's injury.

45. The company was a manufacturer of computer hardware. The

defendant was a retailer who purchased products from the company. At
an industrial convention, the defendant told the company that he heard
that their mutual friend, the plaintiff, was about to go into personal
bankruptcy. The company did not believe what the defendant was
telling him and resolved to mention it to the plaintiff as soon as the
opportunity presented itself. The following day, the plaintiff called the
company to discuss computer hardware. The company told the plaintiff
what the defendant had said at the party. The plaintiff laughed, assured
the company that he was in excellent financial condition, and they both
laughed at the rumor.

917

If the plaintiff asserts a defamation claim against the defendant, which
of the following would be the defendant's most effective argument in
defense?

(A) The plaintiff did not experience mental suffering.

(B) The plaintiff did not sustain damage to his reputation as a result of

the statement.

(C) The defendant was only repeating what he had heard.

(D) The defendant did not publish any statement about the plaintiff.

46. The plaintiff was employed as an insulation installer by various

builders and general contractors for a period of 35 years. During that
time, he was repeatedly exposed to an insulating material manufactured
by the defendant. Last year, it was discovered for the first time that
exposure to the material is a cause of cancer and that the plaintiff had
contracted cancer as a result of his contact with the product.

In a jurisdiction that applies the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence, if the plaintiff asserts a negligence claim against the
defendant for damages resulting from the plaintiff's exposure to the
material, the defendant's most effective defense would be based on the
argument that

(A) the plaintiff assumed the risk.

(B) the defendant did not know that contact with the material would

result in cancer.

(C) the reasonable person in the defendant's situation would not have
anticipated that exposure to the material would result in cancer.

(D) the plaintiff's only remedy is that created by workers' compensation

statutes.

47. A gardener's flower and plant shop was located across the street from
a factory, in a building that the gardener rented from a landlord. Gases
from the factory caused some of the potted plants that the gardener had
for sale in his shop to die. One of the gardener's employees suffered
from allergies. As a result, he found the gases so irritating to his eyes
that he was unable to continue working at the gardener's shop and had
to quit his job. Who may successfully assert a private nuisance claim
against the factory?

918

(A) The landlord only.

(B) The landlord and the gardener only.

(C) The gardener and the employee only.

(D) The landlord, the gardener, and the employee.

48. When the defendant entered a restaurant for lunch, she hung her coat on
the coatrack. When she was leaving, she removed from the rack a coat
that looked like hers, but which actually belonged to the plaintiff. At
the time she took it, the defendant believed it to be her coat, but when
she had driven two miles from the restaurant, she realized that it was
not hers. She turned around and was driving back to the restaurant
when she was involved in an automobile accident. The accident
occurred because the defendant was not paying close attention to her
driving. The plaintiff's coat was completely destroyed in the accident.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for trespass to
chattel, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the coat was completely destroyed after the

defendant took it.

(B) the plaintiff, because the automobile accident in which the coat was

destroyed was the defendant's fault.

(C) the defendant, because she believed the coat to be her own when

she took it.

(D) the defendant, because she was making a reasonable effort to return

the coat when it was destroyed.

49. A trucker was eating cherry pie in a restaurant when a cherry pit

contained in the pie stuck in his throat. Unable to breathe, the trucker
began choking. A doctor, who was eating in the restaurant, ran to the
trucker's aid and performed an operation known as an emergency
tracheotomy. She did this by cutting the skin of the trucker's throat with
a pocket knife and creating an opening in his windpipe through which
the trucker was able to breathe. Then, at the doctor's direction, the
trucker walked across the street to a hospital so that the opening that
the doctor created could be cleaned and bandaged. Because hospital
employees negligently failed to enter the trucker's name in the
emergency room register, he sat in the emergency room for six hours
without further attention. At that time, an earthquake caused a portion

919

of the hospital's structure to fall, striking the trucker in the head and
fracturing his skull. The state had a “Good Samaritan” statute. An
earthquake had never occurred in the state before.

In an action by the trucker against the hospital for damages resulting
from his fractured skull, the court is most likely to find for

(A) the hospital, due to the “Good Samaritan” statute.

(B) the hospital, because the doctor's conduct was unforeseeable.

(C) the hospital, because it was unforeseeable that the trucker would be

injured by an earthquake if left waiting for six hours.

(D) the trucker, since a hospital owes its patients a duty to protect them

against natural disasters.

50. A homeowner went to a garden supply store to purchase fertilizer for
the apple trees that grew in his backyard. Since he did not know what
brand was best for his purposes, he asked the store's owner to
recommend a fertilizer that was especially good for apple trees. The
store owner suggested a product that he said was good for all fruit
trees. The homeowner purchased the product and applied it as the label
directed. While doing so, he got some of the product on his hands.
Because of an allergy that he had, the product irritated his skin, causing
him considerable pain and disabling him for a period of time.

In an action by the homeowner against the store owner for damages
resulting from breach of warranty, which of the following comments is
most correct?

(A) There was no implied warranty that the product was fit for the

homeowner's particular purpose because his purpose was the same
as the product's ordinary use.

(B) There was no implied warranty of merchantability since the
homeowner relied on the store owner's recommendation in
purchasing the product.

(C) There was neither an implied warranty that the product was fit for a
particular purpose nor an implied warranty of merchantability.

(D) There was an implied warranty that the product was fit for the

homeowner's particular use and there was an implied warranty of
merchantability.

920

51. The defendant is a supplier of telephone service to the city. Many of
the wooden poles from which the defendant's wires are strung have
been standing for more than 40 years and are in a rotted condition. A
driver lost control of his automobile because he was driving while
intoxicated, and he collided with one of the defendant's rotten poles.
As a result of the collision, the pole fell over, striking a parked car and
injuring the plaintiff, who was sitting in it. The force of the collision
would have caused even a reasonably good pole to fall.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the court should find
for

(A) the plaintiff, because it was unreasonable for the defendant to

permit its poles to become rotten.

(B) the plaintiff, since it was foreseeable that if a pole fell, it would

injure a person sitting in a parked car.

(C) the defendant, since the driver's conduct either amounted to gross

negligence or was criminal.

(D) the defendant, because the force of the collision would have caused

even a reasonably good pole to fall.

52. A truck and a car collided in an intersection. The drivers asserted

negligence claims against each other for damage to their vehicles. In
answer to specific questions posed by the court, the jury found that the
accident was 60 percent the fault of the truck driver and 40 percent the
fault of the car driver. In addition, the jury found that damage to the
truck amounted to $1,000 and that damage to the car amounted to
$10,000.

The jurisdiction had a statute that provided that “In any negligence
action, a plaintiff's recovery shall not be barred by that plaintiff's fault,
but the recovery of said plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to
that plaintiff's fault.” Which of the following correctly states the sum to
which the car driver is entitled?

(A) $6,000 ($10,000 less 40 percent).

(B) $4,000 ($10,000 less 60 percent).

(C) $10,000.

(D) 0.

921

53. A boy, who was 11 years old, received a sled manufactured by the sled
company from his uncle as a Christmas present. Since he already had a
better sled, the boy sold the sled to his neighbor, the plaintiff. The
plaintiff was riding the sled down a snow-covered hill when one of the
bolts that held it together broke, causing the sled to overturn and injure
the plaintiff severely. The bolt broke because of a crack that existed
when the sled left the sled factory but which was too minute to be
discovered by reasonable inspection. If the plaintiff brings an action
against the sled company, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the cracked bolt was a defect.

(B) the plaintiff, because the boy did not use the sled before selling it to

the plaintiff.

(C) the sled company, since the sale by the boy was outside the regular

course of business.

(D) the sled company, because the crack was too minute to be

discovered upon reasonable inspection.

54. The landlord was the owner of a four-story office building. The entire
second floor of the building was leased to an attorney, and the other
floors were divided into offices and leased to various other tenants.
The attorney was riding in the building elevator when it suddenly and
without warning plunged swiftly downward, shaking the attorney up
severely. The lease required the landlord to keep the elevator in good
repair. Minutes later, the attorney led one of his clients to the elevator.
When they were riding in the elevator to the attorney's office the
elevator suddenly plunged swiftly downward, stopping short when it
reached the bottom of the elevator shaft. The client was severely
injured in the fall.

The client asserted a negligence claim against the attorney for damages
resulting from the elevator accident. The court should find for

(A) the client, because the attorney knew or should have known that the

elevator might not be working properly.

(B) the client, because the entire second floor had been leased to the

attorney.

(C) the attorney, because the lease required the landlord to keep the

elevator in good repair.

922

(D) the attorney, because he was only a tenant in the building.

55. A trucker was driving a truckload of gravel over a highway in a rural
part of the state when, through no fault of her own, one of the tires on
her truck blew out, causing the truck to go out of control. The truck
overturned, spilling the gravel onto the land of the landowner, which
was adjacent to the road. The trucker, who was unhurt, returned later
with another truck and a tractor equipped with a power shovel. Using
the power shovel, the trucker scooped up the spilled gravel and loaded
it onto the other truck.

If the landowner asserts a claim against the trucker for trespass to
land, the court should award the landowner a judgment for

(A) nominal damages only.

(B) all damages resulting from the spilling of gravel onto the

landowner's land.

(C) only the damages caused by the trucker's removal of the gravel from

the landowner's land.

(D) no damages.

56. A horseman owned and bred horses and was an excellent rider. He
purchased a horse he had heard was wild and dangerous because he
hoped that he would be able to “break” or train him. Each time the
horseman attempted to approach the horse, however, it reared and
kicked at him. Finally, the horseman hired a professional horse trainer
to break the horse. After explaining that the horse had repeatedly
attacked him, the horseman showed the trainer to the corral. While the
horseman stood outside watching, the trainer entered the corral,
holding out his hand and making soft murmuring noises to attract the
horse's attention. When the horse saw the trainer, the horse kicked him,
fracturing the trainer's leg.

If the trainer asserts a claim for damages against the horseman, the
court should find for

(A) the trainer, since the horseman knew that the horse had a propensity

to attack human beings.

(B) the trainer, since the horse was a wild animal.

(C) the trainer, since the horseman acted unreasonably in permitting the

923

trainer to enter the corral under the circumstances.

(D) the horseman, since the trainer knew that the horse was dangerous

when he entered the corral.

57. A man bought a used car from the car dealer. Although the car dealer
assured the man that he believed the car to be in good condition, the
contract of sale signed by both the man and the car dealer contained the
phrase “This Vehicle Sold AS IS” in large black letters. The man was
driving the car the following day when the steering jammed, causing
the car to collide with a power pole. The man's wife, who was sitting
beside him in the car, was injured in the crash.

If the wife asserts a claim for damages against the car dealer on the
grounds that the car dealer breached the implied warranty of
merchantability, the court should find for

(A) the car dealer, because the contract of sale contained the phrase,

“This Vehicle Sold AS IS.”

(B) the car dealer, because he did not enter into any contractual

relationship with the wife.

(C) the wife, because the vehicle was unfit for ordinary use.

(D) the wife, because the car dealer said that he believed the car to be

in good condition.

58. The plaintiff brought her car to the defendant, a used car dealer, asking
him to sell it for her. The defendant said that he would attempt to do so
on consignment, at a commission consisting of 20 percent of the sale
price. The plaintiff said that the terms were acceptable to her, but that
because she had recently spent $800 for a custom two-tone, black-and-
silver paint job, she wanted the car kept out of the sun. The defendant
agreed, and the plaintiff left the car with him.

The defendant left the car in the sun, which caused its paint to fade.
Believing that a new paint job would make the car easier to sell, the
defendant had it painted red without consulting the plaintiff. Before it
was repainted, the defendant drove the plaintiff's car 4,000 miles on
his own personal business. After it was painted, the defendant's
customers drove it an additional 1,000 miles while deciding whether
to purchase it. Although the value of the plaintiff's car did not change
while it was in the defendant's possession, the defendant was unable to

924

sell the car. The plaintiff subsequently asserted a conversion claim
against the defendant.

If the plaintiff is successful in her conversion action, the most she will
be entitled to recover is

(A) the value that the car had at the time the plaintiff delivered it to the

defendant.

(B) the cost of restoring its paint to the condition that existed at the time

she delivered it to the defendant.

(C) the reasonable value of the car's use for 4,000 miles.

(D) nothing.

59. A company made a strong insecticide. The container bore a label that
read: “For killing termites. Caution: This product is intended for use
by professional exterminators only. Unauthorized use by any other
persons may be dangerous.” The shop owner placed the container on a
shelf in his shop, where it was discovered by an independent
contractor who the shop owner periodically hired to clean his shop.
Since the cleaner thought there were termites in his house, he opened
the container and poured some of it into a plastic bag that he then
brought home. The next day, the cleaner's three-year-old daughter found
the plastic bag and ate some of the insecticide, becoming seriously ill
as a result. A statute in the jurisdiction adopted the all-or-nothing rule
of contributory negligence.

In a negligence action by the girl against the company, the company's
most effective argument in defense would be that

(A) the cleaner was contributorily negligent.

(B) the shop owner's conduct was an intervening cause of harm.

(C) the cleaner's conduct was an intervening cause of harm.

(D) the company did not act unreasonably.

60. A warehouse owner was the owner of a warehouse that was usually
unattended at night. As a result, burglars had broken in on several
occasions and had stolen valuable merchandise from the warehouse.
The warehouse owner looked into the possibility of hiring a security
guard but decided that it would be too expensive. Instead, he installed
an explosive device in the doorway, rigging it to explode if anyone

925

opened the door without first inserting a key in a specially constructed
slot. A burglar was attempting to break into the warehouse owner's
warehouse for the purpose of stealing when the explosive device
detonated while he was trying to open the door. The burglar was
seriously injured in the explosion.

If the burglar is successful in an action against the warehouse owner, it
will 
most probably be because the court finds that

(A) it was negligent for the warehouse owner to install the explosive

device, since it was foreseeable that a person entering on
legitimate business might be injured by it.

(B) the warehouse owner used excessive force to defend his property,
since the explosive device was liable to inflict serious or deadly
injury.

(C) the use of a mechanical device is not permitted in defense of

property.

(D) the explosive device was just as likely to injure an innocent

bystander as a thief.

61. After living together for several months, a man and his girlfriend began
to argue frequently. The following Saturday, the girlfriend took all the
man's possessions, including his television set, which was valued at
$600, to a swap meet in hopes of selling them. At the swap meet, she
put up a sign that said, “Moving. Everything Must Be Sold Today.”

A neighbor was browsing at the swap meet when she saw the
television set at the girlfriend's booth. She asked whether it was in
good condition, and when the girlfriend said that it was, she asked the
price. The girlfriend said, “$50.” The neighbor immediately handed
the girlfriend the cash, placed the television in her station wagon, and
hurried home.

In an action by the man against the neighbor for conversion, a court
should find for

(A) the man, since the neighbor desired to make the television her own,

and did so.

(B) the man, since the price of $50 should have made the neighbor

926

aware that there was something suspicious about the sale.

(C) the neighbor, since it was reasonable for her to believe that the
girlfriend owned the television set and that the price was low
because the girlfriend needed to sell it in a hurry.

(D) the neighbor, since the television was not in the man's possession

when she acquired it.

62. The plaintiff and the defendant lived on the same street and worked in
the same office, so they formed a car pool, each driving his own car on
alternate days. One day while the defendant was driving, the car in
front of his stopped suddenly and without warning. Since the defendant
had taken his eyes off the road for a moment to look at the plaintiff, he
was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of the stopped
car. The plaintiff was injured as a result of the collision.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “No person shall maintain an
action for damages resulting from negligence in the operation or
ownership of an automobile if said person was a guest in said
automobile at the time said damages allegedly occurred.” In an action
by the plaintiff against the defendant for damages resulting from his
injuries, which of the following arguments is most likely to result in a
judgment for the plaintiff?

(A) The fact that most drivers have insurance makes the statute

obsolete.

(B) The plaintiff was not a guest, since his driving on alternate days

was consideration for the ride.

(C) The defendant's conduct was reckless and therefore constituted
aggravated negligence, a lawsuit that is not prohibited by the
statute.

(D) Enforcement of the statute will leave the plaintiff without a remedy.

63. The company is the manufacturer of a device that was designed for use
by professional rescuers in removing accident victims who have
become pinned in automobiles.

A fire department purchased the device from a firefighter supply store.
Subsequently, the fire department was called to the scene of an
accident in which a woman was trapped in her car. The fire chief
directed a volunteer firefighter to use the device to free the woman

927

from her car, although he knew that the volunteer firefighter had not
been trained in its use and had never heard of it before.

Due to a crack caused by a manufacturing defect, the device operated
improperly, injuring the volunteer firefighter. If the volunteer
firefighter institutes an action against the company, the company's most
effective argument in defense would be that

(A) it had acted reasonably in its marketing and sale of the device.

(B) the firefighter supply store substantially changed the device before

selling it to the fire department.

(C) the volunteer firefighter assumed the risk, since he attempted to use

the device without proper training.

(D) the volunteer firefighter's attempt to use the machine without

training was an independent intervening cause of harm that broke
the chain of proximate causation.

64. As a result of her neighbor's negligence, a baker's shoulder and eye

were both injured. The baker went immediately to her eye doctor. The
eye doctor treated the injury to the baker's eye but suggested that she
see an orthopedist for treatment of her shoulder. The following day, the
baker visited an orthopedist, who treated the baker's shoulder.

Because of negligent treatment by the eye doctor, the baker's nose
became infected, and because of negligent treatment by the
orthopedist, she lost the use of her elbow.

In an action by the baker against the eye doctor, a court is most likely
to hold the eye doctor liable for

(A) nothing, since all the injuries were caused by the negligence of the

neighbor.

(B) the injury to the baker's nose, since it is the only one of her injuries

that was caused by his negligence.

(C) the injury to the baker's nose and the injury to the baker's elbow,

since both were caused by his negligence.

(D) the injuries to the baker's nose, shoulder, and elbow, since all were

caused by his negligence.

65. After taking and failing the state bar exam on 12 different occasions, an

928

attorney decided to practice law without a license. Moving to a small
town, he hung out a shingle that proclaimed him to be an attorney and
ran advertisements in the local newspaper referring to himself as an
attorney. Having seen one of the advertisements, a client retained the
attorney to defend him against a charge of driving while intoxicated.
The attorney attempted to negotiate a plea to a lesser charge, but
because he was unable to do so, a trial was held. The attorney
appeared on behalf of the client, but the client was convicted. During
the course of the trial, the district attorney became suspicious of the
attorney's credentials because he did not defend his client in the way a
reasonable attorney would have done. Following an investigation that
the district attorney instituted, the attorney was charged with violation
of a state law that made it a crime to practice law without a license. He
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months in jail.

If the client brings an action against the 
attorney for negligence in the way the attorney handled his defense, a
court should find for

(A) the client, because the attorney failed to defend him the way a

reasonable attorney would have done.

(B) the client, since it was unreasonable for the attorney to practice law

without a license.

(C) the client, since the law that prohibited practicing law without a

license was designed to keep unqualified persons from practicing
law.

(D) the attorney, since not even a licensed attorney guarantees results.

66. The plaintiff was attending a nightclub at which a hypnotist was
performing. Before the show began, a request was made for a
volunteer to assist the hypnotist with his act, and the plaintiff
volunteered. She was taken backstage to the hypnotist's dressing room,
where she and the hypnotist had a conversation. Following their
conversation, the plaintiff agreed to participate in the hypnotist's show.
During the course of the performance, the hypnotist attempted to
hypnotize the plaintiff on stage. He then touched her skin with an
electric cattle prod (a device that produces an electric shock and is
used for handling stubborn cattle), causing her great pain and
discomfort.

929

The plaintiff subsequently instituted an action against the hypnotist. In
it, she alleged that he committed various intentional torts against her
by touching her with the cattle prod. If one of the following facts were
established at the trial, which one would be most helpful to the
plaintiff in responding to the hypnotist's defense of consent?

(A) During the conversation in the hypnotist's dressing room, the
hypnotist stated that he was going to attempt to hypnotize the
plaintiff on stage, he was usually successful in hypnotizing
volunteers, and if he was successful, the cattle prod would cause
her no discomfort.

(B) During the conversation in the hypnotist's dressing room, the

hypnotist promised to pay her $100 for participating in the show;
he never did pay her; and, in fact, when he promised that he would
pay her, he did not intend to do so.

(C) During the conversation in the hypnotist's dressing room, the
hypnotist stated that the electric cattle prod produced a mild
electric shock that would cause no real discomfort, when he knew
that this was not true.

(D) When the plaintiff consented to participating in the hypnotist's act,

she did not know that contact with the electric cattle prod would
result in great pain and discomfort.

67. A professor publicly stated her opposition to the consumption of

alcohol. As a result, she is much in demand as a lecturer on the evils of
intoxication. One of her slogans is, “When you drink, make it fruit
juice.” The company, a producer of packaged apple juice, invited the
professor to participate in a promotional apple-juice-drinking contest
that it was holding. The professor, who succeeded in drinking one and
one-half quarts of chilled apple juice without stopping for a breath,
was declared the winner.

The student newspaper ran a photo of the professor holding the
winner's trophy over a caption that read, “Prof. drinks them all under
the table, winning first prize at the company's drinking contest.” A
story that described the fruit-juice drinking contest in detail appeared
on the same page as the photo but some distance from it. The day after
the photo and story appeared, an organization that had hired the
professor to lecture on the evils of alcohol canceled its contract with
the professor because, after seeing the photo and caption in the

930

newspaper, some members believed that the professor was a drinker
of alcohol.

If the professor sues the newspaper for defamation, the court should
instruct the jury that the statements made by the newspaper in the photo
and caption were not defamatory if

(A) the reasonable person would have read the story.

(B) the organization members who saw the photo and caption did not

read the story.

(C) a substantial group of respectable persons would have read the

story.

(D) the reasonable person would not have read the story.

68. An athlete appeared in a television commercial. While films of his

medal-winning performances showed in the background, the athlete ate
a candy bar. He said that he had been eating candy bars for energy ever
since he was a child. He ended the commercial by smiling and saying,
“Who knows? Maybe candy bars gave me the power to win.”

The plaintiff purchased a case of 24 candy bars after seeing the
commercial several times on television. After tasting one, however, he
found he did not like the flavor. If the plaintiff brings an action against
the athlete for misrepresentation, which of the following arguments
will be most helpful in the athlete's defense?

(A) The athlete is not in the business of selling candy bars.

(B) The script for the commercial was not written by the athlete.

(C) The plaintiff was not in privity with the athlete.

(D) The plaintiff has not sustained damage as the result of a false

assertion by the athlete.

69. A demolition contractor was hired by a builder to demolish a building
located a half-mile from a horse breeder's farm. The demolition
contractor was using dynamite for that purpose. The breeder called the
contractor and warned him that sounds from the explosions were
scaring his horses. The day after the breeder called, sounds of the
explosions so frightened one of the breeder's horses that the horse tried
to jump over a fence, injuring herself in the process.

931

If the breeder institutes an action against the demolition contractor on a
strict liability theory, which of the following would be the demolition
contractor's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The breeder's farm was not within the foreseeable zone of danger.

(B) The possibility that noise will frighten animals is not one of the

risks that makes blasting an ultra-hazardous activity.

(C) The demolition contractor used reasonable care in setting off the

blast.

(D) The demolition contractor was working under contract to the

builder.

70. The landlord was the owner of a small office building. Her own office
was located on the ground floor of the building, the second floor was
leased to a company, and the third and fourth floors were divided into
smaller offices that were rented to various tenants on a month-to-month
basis. Although the building was equipped with an elevator, occupants
of the building frequently used a stairway over which the landlord
retained control. One day, while one of the company's employees was
walking down the stairs from the second floor, she cut her hand on a
jagged part of the handrail that ran alongside the stairs. She
commenced an action against the landlord, alleging that the handrail
was jagged because of negligence by the landlord.

Which of the following is an accurate statement about the case of the
injured employee vs. the landlord?

(A) The company's employee was an invitee since she was an

employee of one of the landlord's tenants.

(B) The company's employee was contributorily (or comparatively)
negligent if the reasonable person in her situation would have
noticed the jagged condition of the handrail and would have
avoided being injured by it.

(C) The company's employee was an invitee, and she was

contributorily (or comparatively) negligent if the reasonable person
in her situation would have noticed the jagged condition of the
handrail and would have avoided being injured by it.

(D) The company's employee was neither an invitee nor was she

contributorily (or comparatively) negligent.

932

71. A building inspector was employed by the city to conduct periodic
inspections of business premises located in a territory to which she
was assigned. The instruction manual that the city furnished to its
inspectors contained instructions on testing draperies for fire-retardant
properties. In large boldface letters, the manual stated, “NEVER
EXPOSE DRAPERIES TO FLAME WHILE THEY ARE HANGING
IN PLACE.”

One of the businesses in the building inspector's territory was a
nightclub. On one of her inspections of the nightclub, the building
inspector asked the manager of the business whether the window
draperies were fire-retardant as required by the city's building code.
The manager responded that they were. Although the building
inspector was familiar with the instructions in the manual, she was in a
hurry. Taking a cigarette lighter from her pocket, she held its flame
under one of the draperies where it was hanging. The drapery caught
fire, which spread, completely destroying the building. A passerby
was injured in the fire.

If the passerby brings an action for damages against the city on a
theory of respondeat superior, the passerby will

(A) lose, since the building inspector was acting in violation of

specific instructions from her employer.

(B) lose, since the building inspector's duties involve the exercise of

unsupervised discretion.

(C) win, because the building inspector was negligent.

(D) win, whether or not the building inspector was negligent.

72. A statute provides that every motor vehicle must be equipped with an
ignition lock, and that it shall be a misdemeanor for any person to park
a motor vehicle without locking it and removing the ignition key. The
statute was enacted after many accidents involving stolen cars. The
defendant left his car parked on a public street with the ignition key in
it, in violation of the statute. A small monkey that had escaped from a
nearby circus got in the car, managed to turn the key, and drove the car
down the street before hitting the plaintiff. If the plaintiff sues the
defendant, the plaintiff will:

(A) win, because it was unreasonable for the defendant to leave his

keys in the ignition.

933

(B) win, because the statute was designed to prevent accidents

involving stolen cars.

(C) lose, because the intervention of the monkey was likely

unforeseeable.

(D) lose, because the intervention of the monkey was likely

foreseeable.

73. The state governor was attending a major league baseball game when a
member of the home team hit a home run. The governor jumped to his
feet and cheered loudly, along with the rest of the crowd. A freelance
photographer took his picture while he was cheering. When the
photograph was developed, the photographer had it imprinted on
targets. With toy plastic darts, the photographer marketed and sold
several thousand. The governor sued the photographer for invasion of
privacy.

On which of the following theories is the governor most likely to be
successful in his action against the photographer?

(A) Appropriation of identity.

(B) Public disclosure.

(C) Intrusion.

(D) False light.

74. A professor was disturbed by the fact that students frequently left the
room during her lectures, so she instructed her teaching assistant to
lock the door of her classroom 10 minutes after the class began and not
to unlock it again until 10 minutes before the class was scheduled to
end. On Thursday, a student attended the professor's four o'clock class.
By five minutes past four, the student was sound asleep in his seat. At
ten minutes past four, the teaching assistant locked the classroom door
as instructed by the professor, unlocking it at ten minutes to five. When
the class ended at five, the student, who had slept through the class,
was awakened by a classmate and left the room. The classroom had
been painted the previous day with a paint to which the student was
allergic, although neither the professor, the teaching assistant, nor the
student knew about it. As a result of his exposure to the paint in the
room, the student developed allergic symptoms later that day that
required hospitalization.

934

If the student institutes an action for false imprisonment against the
professor, who will win?

(A) The student, because his illness resulted from the professor's

intentional confinement of him.

(B) The student, since a professor owes her students a duty to refrain
from exposing them to unreasonable risks of foreseeable harm.

(C) The professor, since she did not know with substantial certainty that

harm would result from locking the door.

(D) The professor, since she did not confine the student against his will.

75. The Lovers of God is a small religious sect. During the 19th century,
they were prosecuted for engaging in religious rituals that involved
public nudity and group sex. Some non-members of the sect continue to
associate it with illicit sex and continue to call its members “Makers,”
a term coined by 19th-century journalists who campaigned against the
sect.

A minister ordained in the Church of Love, a religious organization
that is not associated in any way with the Lovers, spoke at a local
meeting. The following day, a local daily newspaper printed an article
about the meeting. The article referred to the minister as “a minister of
the Church of Love, better known as the Makers (Lovers of God).”
The minister sued the newspaper, alleging that the reference to him as
a minister of “the Makers (Lovers of God)” was defamatory.

In his lawsuit, the minister must prove that the newspaper

(A) knew, or that the reasonable publisher would have known, that the

minister was not affiliated with the Lovers of God.

(B) entertained serious doubts about whether or not the minister was

affiliated with the Lovers of God.

(C) knew that “the Makers (Lovers of God)” were associated with

shame or disgrace in the minds of some readers.

(D) made the statement, but the minister is not required to prove fault

since the minister is not a public person.

76. The defendant owned a small hardware store. One of the products he
sold were circular saws made by a local manufacturer. The defendant
sold the saws in their original boxes. One day, the defendant sold the

935

plaintiff a saw. Two years later, the plaintiff hurt herself badly when
the blade detached from the saw and cut her in the face. The blade
broke free after delivery to the plaintiff and was due to poor design by
the manufacturing company. There was no research available that
would have indicated to the defendant that there was a risk of such
injury or that the product was badly designed. The plaintiff sued the
defendant for her injuries. Assuming the saw design constituted a
dangerous defect, the court should find

(A) in favor of the defendant, because there was no indication the

defendant behaved negligently.

(B) in favor of the defendant, because there was no way the defendant
could have discovered the risk of such breakage before selling the
product to the plaintiff.

(C) in favor of the plaintiff, because the defendant sold the saw.

(D) in favor of the plaintiff, because selling the defective saws was

unreasonable.

77. A driver was driving her automobile in the rain on a curvy road known

for numerous accidents when she rounded a bend and saw a cow
standing directly in her path. She immediately jammed on her brakes
and pulled the steering wheel to the right in an attempt to avoid striking
the cow. As a result, she lost control of her car, which skidded off the
road and into the homeowner's yard. The homeowner, who was in the
process of installing an automatic watering system, had dug a trench
across the yard for pipes. When the wheels of the driver's car hit the
trench, the car stopped abruptly, throwing the driver forward into the
windshield and causing her to be injured.

In an action by the driver against the homeowner for negligence, will a
court decide 
that the homeowner owed the driver a duty of reasonable care?

(A) Yes, because it was foreseeable that persons driving on the road

might lose control of their vehicles and skid into the homeowner's
yard.

(B) Yes, because the homeowner knew that drivers used the

neighboring road.

(C) No, because it was not unreasonable for the homeowner to dig a

trench on his own land.

936

(D) No, because the driver was a trespasser.

78. A carpenter who was building a house on his own property had posted
a sign that said, “No Trespassing.” While he was working, he threw his
hammer off the roof. The hammer hit a truck driver who was walking
across the property because he mistakenly thought he was supposed to
deliver a load of wood to the carpenter. Even though he saw the
hammer hit, the carpenter failed to call for help. A passerby called an
ambulance, and after the ambulance picked up the truck driver, the
ambulance had an accident resulting in the truck driver's death.

The representative of the truck driver's estate instituted an appropriate
action against the carpenter, alleging that the carpenter's failure to call
for medical assistance after he saw the hammer strike the truck driver
was negligence. Which of the following comments is most accurate
regarding that allegation?

(A) The carpenter owed the truck driver no duty to call for help if the

truck driver was a trespasser.

(B) The truck driver's estate is entitled to punitive (exemplary)

damages if the carpenter was substantially certain that there was a
possibility of harm resulting from his failure to act.

(C) The carpenter's failure to call for medical aid was not a factual

cause of harm to the truck driver since someone did call a moment
later.

(D) the truck driver was an invitee since he was a user of the public

street who had entered upon adjacent private land.

79. The company had been operating a soap factory in the county for 50
years. When the factory was first opened, the nearest residential
settlement was the town, six miles away. Because the factory has been
in existence for 50 years, county zoning ordinances were drafted to
allow its continued operation. In the past 50 years, however, the town
has expanded in size. Now the edge of town is only a quarter of a mile
from the company's factory. On days when the wind is blowing from
the direction of the factory, residents of the town are annoyed by the
noxious odor emanating from the factory chimneys. A homeowner, who
moved to the town three years ago, has asked the town attorney to seek
an injunction to prohibit the company from emitting foul odors, but the
town attorney has refused.

937

If the homeowner sues the company for damages resulting from the
odors on a theory of public nuisance, which of the following will be
the company's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The company's operation preceded the growth of the town.

(B) The homeowner came to the nuisance.

(C) The homeowner's damages are no different from those of other

residents of the town.

(D) A lawful activity cannot constitute a public nuisance.

80. The defendant and the plaintiff had been friends for years and worked
in the same office. Ever since they were children, they had enjoyed
playing practical jokes on each other. One day, planning to have some
fun with the plaintiff, the defendant bought a large rubber spider from a
toy store. Knowing that the plaintiff was terrified of spiders, the
defendant came into work early and placed the toy spider in the top
drawer of the plaintiff's desk. Later, when the plaintiff arrived at work,
he opened his top drawer and saw the rubber spider. Believing it to be
real and terrified that it would bite him, the plaintiff screamed in fear,
fainted, and fell to the floor. As he fell, he struck his head on the corner
of his desk, sustaining a serious fracture of the skull.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim for assault against the defendant for the
injury that he sustained in the fall, which of the following arguments
would be most effective in the defendant's defense?

(A) The plaintiff's fear of being bitten by a spider was not apprehension

of a battery.

(B) The reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would not have

become apprehensive at the sight of a spider.

(C) The plaintiff impliedly consented to the prank by engaging in a

course of practical joking with the defendant.

(D) The defendant was not substantially certain that the plaintiff would

be injured as a result of the joke.

81. The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, and proved

the following:

The defendant and his friend were both slingshot enthusiasts known for
the accuracy of their aim. Without consulting the other, each went

938

independently to the woods outside of town to practice his or her skill.
Since not many people frequented the area, the defendant and his
friend were both somewhat casual about their targets, each shooting at
anything that moved without properly checking to make sure of what
they were shooting at. The plaintiff, who had gone to the woods to
read in solitude, was struck by a steel ball shot from one of the
slingshots. Since the defendant and his friend were using the same kind
of ammunition, it is impossible to determine which of them fired the
ball that struck the plaintiff, but it is certain that one of them did.

If the court finds for the defendant, it will probably be for which one
of the following reasons?

(A) The defendant did not owe the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care

since not many people frequented the area.

(B) There is no evidence that the defendant acted unreasonably.

(C) The evidence does not establish that the defendant's conduct was a

factual cause of the injury.

(D) Even if the defendant's conduct was a factual cause of the injury, it
is impossible to tell whether it was a legal cause of the injury.

82. Statutes in the state provide that persons under the age of 20 years are
incompetent to enter into contracts, may not marry without the written
consent of their parents, may not lawfully purchase alcoholic
beverages, and are subject to local curfew regulations. A 19-year-old
girl was fishing for pleasure from a pier in the state when she
accidentally struck a fisherman in the eye with a fishhook on the end of
her line. The fisherman commenced a negligence action against the girl.
The trial court should find that the girl was negligent because

(A) she failed to act like a reasonable 19-year-old with her experience

and intelligence.

(B) fishing is an adult activity.

(C) at 19 she is old enough to be treated as an adult by the law of torts.

(D) the risk of injury caused by her use of the fishhook outweighs the

utility of fishing for pleasure.

83. A company manufactured several kinds of cooked-fruit desserts.

A man bought one of the company's desserts at a grocery store, opened

939

the package and began eating the contents with a spoon. After
consuming more than half of the product, the man noticed parts of a
rat's tail mixed with the cooked fruit.

If the man asserts a claim against the company on the theory of strict
liability in tort, which of the following would be the man's most
effective argument?

(A) The presence of a rat's tail was a defect that made the product

unreasonably dangerous.

(B) The man was in horizontal privity with the grocery store, and there

is no need for vertical privity.

(C) The labeling and packaging implied a promise that the contents of

the package purchased by the man were fit for human consumption.

(D) The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, since the product was

sold in a sealed package.

84. A driver swerved to avoid a car and hit a boy walking along the road.
The boy's mother had told the boy that she did not want him riding his
bicycle on the road because it was a heavily travelled roadway with
no sidewalks. She gave him permission, however, to walk his bicycle
carefully along the road shoulder.

The jurisdiction applies the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence.

If the boy's mother asserts a negligence claim against the driver for the
medical bills that she incurred as a result of the boy's injury, which of
the following may the driver assert in defense?

(A) The accident resulted from the boy's negligence.

(B) The accident resulted from the boy's mother's negligence.

(C) The accident resulted from both the boy's and his mother's

negligence.

(D) The driver cannot claim that either the boy or his mother was

negligent.

85. The defendant was towing a small travel-trailer with his automobile
when the hitch that attached the trailer to the car broke, causing the
trailer to collide with the vehicle of the plaintiff, which was parked at

940

the curb. A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “No person shall
operate a motor vehicle or trailer on the roads of this state unless said
motor vehicle or trailer is covered by a valid policy of liability
insurance.” The defendant was in violation of that statute in that he
knew that his trailer was not covered by a valid policy of liability
insurance at the time of the accident. Is his violation of statute relevant
to the issue of negligence in an action brought against him by the
plaintiff?

(A) Yes, because the statute was designed to protect the victims of

automobile and trailer accidents.

(B) Yes, because the reasonable person does not knowingly violate a

statute.

(C) No, because the law encourages the purchase of automobile

insurance and therefore absolutely prohibits disclosure to the jury
about whether or not a defendant was insured.

(D) No, because compliance with the statute does not prevent

automobile or trailer accidents.

86. One night, police officers received a message that a burglary was in

progress at a grocery store. In the ensuing attempt to make an arrest, the
officers knocked over several stacks of merchandise, including cases
of bottled soda-pop manufactured by the company. This caused minute
cracks in all the bottles. A woman purchased one of the bottles but did
not notice the minute crack in it.

That evening, the woman was placing the bottle on the dinner table
when the bottle exploded. The woman was cut by flying glass.

In an action by the woman against the company, may she successfully
rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur?

(A) Yes, because it applies in exploding bottle cases.

(B) Yes, because the company was in exclusive control of the bottling

process.

(C) No, because the bottles were knocked over by the officers.

(D) No, because the bottles were not in the company's possession at the

time the woman's injury occurred.

87. A contractor did some renovations on a customer's apartment. In order

941

to put in a new window, the contractor used a glue made by a local
manufacturer. Due to a design defect, the glue released highly toxic
fumes that floated into a neighbor's apartment and caused severe lung
injuries. The neighbor can recover

(A) in strict liability against the contractor.

(B) in strict liability against the manufacturer.

(C) in strict liability against the contractor or manufacturer.

(D) in negligence only.

88. One day, while a well-known collector was visiting the dealer's art
gallery, the dealer showed him a new painting that she had received
that day.

“The artist didn't sign it,” the dealer said. “But I'm sure it was painted
by Degas. That would make it worth at least $250,000.”

The collector answered, “It's by Degas, all right. It's worth every cent
you're asking. But I already have several paintings by Degas in my
collection, and I don't need another.”

The buyer, who was browsing in the dealer's gallery, overheard the
conversation between the collector and the dealer. The buyer knew
very little about art. Because he knew that the collector and the dealer
were art experts, he believed what he heard them saying. After the
collector left the gallery, the buyer purchased the painting for
$225,000. The buyer subsequently learned that it had not been painted
by Degas and was worth only $600.

If the buyer asserts a tort claim for misrepresentation against the
dealer, which of the following would be the dealer's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) A statement of opinion cannot be construed as a misrepresentation,

since there is no such thing as a false idea.

(B) The buyer did not sustain damage as a result of his reliance on a

statement by the dealer.

(C) The dealer did not know that the buyer would rely on the statements

that she made to the collector.

(D) The value of any work of art is a matter of opinion.

942

89. As a joke, the defendant knocked on the plaintiff's door wearing a

police officer's uniform that he had rented from a costume shop. When
the plaintiff came to the door, the defendant told her that her husband
had just been killed in a highway accident, and that she would have to
come with him to claim the body. The plaintiff, who recognized the
defendant and knew that he was not a police officer, slammed the door
in his face and told him to leave her alone. She was outraged at his
attempt to play such a joke on her, but she sustained no physical or
mental injury.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for intentional
infliction of emotional distress, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant's conduct exceeded all bounds

normally tolerated by decent society.

(B) the plaintiff, because the defendant's conduct was calculated to

cause severe mental suffering.

(C) the defendant, because his intention was merely to play a joke on

the plaintiff.

(D) the defendant, because the plaintiff sustained no physical or mental

injury as a result of the defendant's conduct.

90. Which of the following most correctly states the duty owed to
customers by a druggist who dispenses prescription drugs?

(A) To know all the harmful side effects of the drugs being dispensed.

(B) To warn of all the harmful side effects of the drugs being dispensed.

(C) To sell only those drugs that are not defective.

(D) To make whatever inspection of the drugs is reasonable before

dispensing them.

91. A plaintiff asserted a claim for damages against a man and his friend.

The man and his friend had been trying to see who could hit a golf ball
farthest. The plaintiff succeeded in proving that a golf ball that struck
him had been driven by one of them, but he was unable to show which
one. The court found that both the man and his friend had acted
negligently, and that they were involved in a concert of action.

Which of the following statements is most correct about the
relationship of the parties?

943

(A) Either the man or his friend may avoid liability by proving that his

ball was not the one that struck the plaintiff.

(B) Neither the man's nor his friend's conduct was a factual cause of
harm because each one's conduct was a substantial factor in
producing the plaintiff's injury.

(C) The man's conduct and his friend's conduct were legal causes of

harm, but neither was a factual cause of harm.

(D) The man and his friend may each be held vicariously liable for the

other's conduct.

92. A cancer patient was given a drug that caused her to have an allergic

reaction that blinded her in one eye. The patient subsequently retained
an attorney to commence a malpractice action against the doctor for the
damages that resulted from her allergic reaction. Although the statute of
limitations on such an action fixed a period of one year, more than one
year passed before the attorney commenced an action against the
doctor. As a result, no such action could ever be brought. The patient
eventually sued the attorney, alleging that the attorney's failure to bring
the action on time was negligent.

Which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most effective as part of the attorney's
defense?

(A) The attorney had been admitted to the bar only three weeks before

being retained by the patient.

(B) The attorney honestly believed that the statutory period of

limitations for the commencement of medical malpractice actions
was two years.

(C) After discussing the case with the doctor's attorney, the attorney

came to the conclusion that the patient's case against the doctor was
weak.

(D) Cancer would have led to the patient's death within a few months if
left untreated, and the drug was the only drug available for its
treatment.

93. The defendant was an elderly man who lived in a house with a

swimming pool in the backyard. Although the defendant enjoyed
swimming in the pool, his age and physical infirmity made him unable

944

to clean or maintain the pool himself. Instead, he agreed to allow his
14-year-old neighbor, the plaintiff, to swim in the pool anytime she
wanted without notifying the defendant or asking his permission, in
exchange for the plaintiff's services in cleaning and maintaining the
pool.

On Friday morning, the plaintiff thoroughly cleaned the defendant's
pool. Later that day, the defendant drained all the water from the pool
and did not refill it. Saturday morning, the plaintiff woke up early and
decided to go swimming in the defendant's pool. She put on her
bathing suit and went into the defendant's yard, running onto the diving
board of his swimming pool and diving in without looking first. The
plaintiff was severely injured when she fell to the concrete bottom of
the empty swimming pool.

If the plaintiff asserts a negligence claim for her injuries against the
defendant in a jurisdiction that has a pure comparative negligence
statute, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the pool constituted an attractive nuisance.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff was a trespasser.

(C) the plaintiff, because it was unreasonable for the defendant to drain

the pool without warning her.

(D) the defendant, because a reasonable person in the plaintiff's
position would have known the risk of diving into an empty
swimming pool.

94. A playground was directly adjacent to a company's property, separated
from it by a 6-foot wire mesh fence. The company officials were
aware that a large gaping hole in this fence had existed for
approximately one year, and that children frequently crept through the
hole to play on the company's property.

One morning, the plaintiff, a 12-year-old student, entered the
company's property through the hole in the fence. The plaintiff began
climbing spikes that had been driven into a pole. When she reached a
wooden platform located 12 feet aboveground, she put her head
through the hole in its center to see what was above it. Her head came
into contact with a high-voltage wire that had been strung over the
platform, causing her to sustain serious injuries.

945

In a negligence action by the plaintiff against the company, which one
of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one
true, would provide the company with its most effective argument in
defense?

(A) The plaintiff entered the premises without the company's

permission.

(B) To the company's knowledge, no child had ever before attempted to

climb the pole.

(C) The plaintiff was old enough to comprehend the dangers associated

with an attempt to climb the pole.

(D) The fence that separated the company's property from the

schoolyard was located completely on realty occupied by the
school.

95. Several cases of explosives made by a company were shipped to a
buyer in another state to be stored in a warehouse pending delivery.
While the explosives were there, the warehouse facility was struck by
lightning, causing the explosives to explode. The cases containing the
explosives did not bear any description of their contents. If the
warehouse employees knew that the cases contained explosives, they
would have stored them in a way that would have prevented the
explosion. A homeowner who sustained property damage as a result of
the explosion has asserted a claim against the company.

Which of the following facts or inferences, if it were the only one true,
would provide the company with its most effective argument in
defense?

(A) The company did not do anything unreasonable or irresponsible in

manufacturing, packaging, or labeling its product.

(B) When the company shipped the cases of explosives, they had been
properly labeled with firmly affixed labels identifying their
contents, but the labels had somehow come off in transit.

(C) The company had assigned an employee to make sure that all cases
of explosives shipped by the company were properly labeled, but
the employee had forgotten to inspect this shipment.

(D) The storage of explosives by the warehouse was an ultra-hazardous

activity.

946

96. A restaurant opened on the edge of a college bar area, which abutted a
residential neighborhood. The restaurant had a walk-up window where
people could purchase food and drinks without going inside. The
restaurant and window were open until 4 A.M. every night. College
students soon started to congregate in front of the restaurant. On many
nights, the students were loud, and some even engaged in the use of
illegal drugs or drank alcohol underage. The plaintiff, who lived in a
house next to the new restaurant, complained and told the restaurant it
was bringing down his property value. He demanded that the restaurant
close at 11 P.M., like many other restaurants in the area. The restaurant
refused.

If the plaintiff chooses to sue, which of the following legal theories
would be most likely to result in a judgment for the plaintiff?

(A) Invasion of privacy.

(B) Intentional infliction of emotional distress.

(C) Trespass to land.

(D) Private nuisance.

97. During a comedian's long career in the entertainment business, the

comedian's trademark was always a cigar that he clenched between his
teeth or held in his hand while delivering his jokes. As part of an
interview on a television show, the interviewer asked the comedian
whether he really smoked cigars. The comedian replied, “Sure. I
always smoke these cigars. They're the best cigars made.”

The following day, the manufacturer of the cigars placed several
advertisements in newspapers. All the advertisements said, “Jimmy
Stoker the Famous Comedian says our cigars are the best cigars made.
He always smokes them, and you should too.”

If the comedian asserts a claim against the cigar company for invasion
of privacy by misappropriation of identity, the court should find for

(A) the cigar company, because the comedian had in fact made the

statement that appeared in the advertisement.

(B) the cigar company, because the advertisement constituted a
constitutionally protected form of commercial expression.

(C) the comedian, because when he made the statement on the

947

television show, it was unforeseeable that the cigar company
would use it in its advertising.

(D) the comedian, because the cigar company used his name to sell its

product without his permission.

98. The defendant grew fruit trees on her farm outside the village. In

addition, she operated a fruit store in the village. Every day during the
harvest season, in a trailer that she towed with her pickup truck, she
hauled fresh fruit from her orchards to her store. One day, as she was
towing the trailer filled with fruit up a hill on her way to the village,
the hitch that fastened the trailer to the pickup truck failed, permitting
the trailer to break loose and roll down the hill, striking and damaging
the home of the plaintiff. Subsequent investigation revealed that the
hitch failed because one of its parts was made of defective steel.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damage to his
house, the court's decision is most likely to turn on whether

(A) the defendant acted reasonably.

(B) the hitch was defective in manufacture or in design.

(C) the defendant was a merchant.

(D) the plaintiff could have foreseen the damage.

99. The pilot was a helicopter pilot employed by a radio station as a

traffic reporter. One day, while flying in his helicopter, he hovered
over the home of a woman. Using powerful binoculars, he looked into
her window to watch her while she was exercising in the nude. If the
woman institutes an action against him, which of the following facts or
inferences must she establish to make out a prima facie case of
trespass to land?

(A) The altitude at which the pilot hovered over her house.

(B) Damage to her land, or to her right to enjoy it, that resulted from the

pilot's conduct.

(C) That she had a reasonable expectation of privacy while exercising

nude in her own home.

(D) That she was in lawful possession of the premises at the time that

the pilot hovered over her house.

100. When a woman discovered that her car had been stolen, she reported

948

the theft to the police. Then, while she was walking home from the
police station, she saw her car in a homeowner's driveway, where the
person who stole it had abandoned it after using it in a bank robbery.
When she began walking toward the automobile, the homeowner ran
out of his house shouting, “Hey, you! Where do you think you're
going?” The woman explained that she was attempting to retrieve her
car, but the homeowner pushed her, saying, “Get off my land.” The
woman, who sustained no physical or mental injury as a result of the
homeowner's contact with her, got into her car and drove it away. The
woman subsequently commenced a battery action against the
homeowner. If, in response to the woman's claim, the homeowner
asserts the privilege to defend realty, the court should find for

(A) the homeowner, because the woman was not in hot pursuit of her

car when she entered the homeowner's realty.

(B) the homeowner, because the woman was not injured as a result of

his contact with her.

(C) the woman, because force is never permitted in defense of realty.

(D) the woman, because she was privileged to enter and retake her

automobile.

101. A husband's wife died when she jumped in front of a train owned by
the railroad. Two weeks later, a railroad employee contacted the
husband. The employee said that although the railroad was not legally
responsible for the wife's death, the railroad was willing to pay
$1,000 in full settlement of all claims arising from the wife's death.
When the husband said he wanted to speak with an attorney, the
employee told him that if an attorney got involved, the railroad would
not pay anything because the husband “had no legal claim.” The
husband doubted that the employee was telling the truth, so he
consulted with an attorney. The attorney didn't think the husband had a
claim and declined representation. Consequently, the husband accepted
the $1,000 and executed a general release. The husband then retained
another attorney and instituted a wrongful death action against the
railroad. The court dismissed, citing the release.

Which of the following additional facts must the husband prove to
establish a cause of action for misrepresentation against the employee?

(A) If the husband's wrongful death suit was not dismissed, it would
have resulted in a judgment for the husband in excess of $1,000.

949

(B) When the employee made the statements to the husband, the

employee knew or should have known that the statements were
false.

(C) The husband's wrongful death suit would have resulted in a

judgment for the husband in excess of $1,000, and the employee
knew or should have known the statements were false.

(D) The husband doesn't have to prove that his lawsuit would have
resulted in a judgment in excess of $1,000, or that the employee
knew or should have known his statements were false.

102. The company, a manufacturer of dog whistles, operated a factory for
that purpose. The whistles manufactured by the company issued a
sound so high-pitched that it could not be heard by human ears; only
dogs could hear it. For this reason, before leaving the assembly line,
each whistle was tested by a machine that blew air through it and
metered the sound that it made. After the company's factory had been in
operation for 15 years, a breeder moved onto the adjoining realty and
began operating a kennel. Two weeks after moving onto the realty, the
breeder discovered that the dogs in his kennel were being disturbed by
the testing of dog whistles in the company's factory. Although he told
the company about the problem, the company did not stop testing the
whistles. The breeder commenced a private nuisance action against it.
Which of the following would be the company's most effective
argument in defense against the breeder's claim?

(A) The operation of a dog-whistle factory is a lawful business.

(B) The breeder came to the nuisance.

(C) The company did not intend to cause harm to the breeder or to the

breeder's business.

(D) The breeder's damage resulted from the fact that the breeder was

making an unusually sensitive use of the land.

103. The plaintiff purchased a bottle of dishwashing detergent from the

defendant, a self-service supermarket. The plaintiff selected the
product from the defendant's shelves, carried it to a checkout counter,
and paid the cashier. The plaintiff then placed the bottle in a bag
furnished by the defendant and carried it home. The product purchased
by the plaintiff was manufactured by a local company. The product had
a label stating that it would not harm a user's skin. After using the

950

product for washing dishes, the plaintiff experienced a serious rash on
his hands and wrists as the result of an allergic reaction to a chemical
in the product.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for breach of
express warranty, a court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the label stated that the product would not

harm the skin of a user.

(B) the plaintiff, because the product was unfit for ordinary use.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff's injury resulted from reliance

on a statement that the company caused to be printed on the label of
its product.

(D) the defendant, because no employee of the defendant knew what
statements were contained on the company's detergent label.

104. The defendant bought a new sailboat, although he had never been on

one before. Although the defendant had not received any instruction at
all, and although he heard a weather report that warned of severe
storms, he decided to take the boat out for a test sail by himself. A few
minutes after he left the dock with his boat, the storm struck, causing
high and dangerous waves. Fearful that the defendant would be killed
at sea, the defendant's wife stood crying on the shore. The plaintiff, an
experienced sailor who knew the defendant and the defendant's wife,
heard the defendant's wife crying about her husband's predicament.
Without saying anything to the defendant's wife, the plaintiff went out
in his own boat to look for the defendant. The defendant returned
unhurt an hour later, but the plaintiff's boat capsized in the storm,
severely damaging his boat and causing the plaintiff to sustain injury.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for the damage that
he sustained, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because his damage resulted from the defendant's

failure to act reasonably.

(B) the plaintiff, because a rescuer is entitled to indemnity from the

person whom he or she was attempting to rescue.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff was an officious intermeddler.

(D) the defendant, because the defendant was unaware that the plaintiff

951

would attempt to rescue him.

105. The defendant was driving to visit her fiancé. Before she left, her

friend asked her to deliver a small package to someone. The package
contained a bottle of caustic chemicals. Because she was afraid that
the defendant would refuse to carry it if she knew its contents, the
friend wrapped the package in brown paper and did not tell the
defendant what was in it. The defendant placed the package in the
glove compartment of her car and began driving. Along the way, the
defendant saw the plaintiff hitchhiking by the side of the road. The
defendant offered the plaintiff a ride. While the plaintiff was sitting in
the front seat, the plaintiff opened the glove compartment and removed
the wet package. As soon as the caustic liquid touched the plaintiff's
hand, it burned his skin severely.

If the plaintiff commences a negligence action against the defendant in
a jurisdiction that has no automobile guest statute and that applies the
all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence, which of the following
would be the defendant's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff was a mere licensee and was entitled only to a
warning of those conditions that the defendant knew were
dangerous.

(B) The defendant could not have known or anticipated that the contents

of the package would cause harm to a passenger in her car.

(C) The plaintiff was contributorily negligent in touching the wet

package.

(D) The plaintiff assumed the risk of injury resulting from contact with

the wet package.

106. The plaintiff decided to have a rosebud tattooed on her shoulder.

While the defendant was tattooing the plaintiff's shoulder, the tattoo
needle broke off in the plaintiff's skin, injuring the plaintiff. If the
plaintiff asserts a strict liability claim against the defendant on the
ground that the tattoo needle that the defendant used was defective, the
defendant's most effective argument in defense would be that

(A) the defendant did not sell the needle to the plaintiff.

(B) the defendant was not the manufacturer of the needle and therefore

had no control over its quality.

952

(C) the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury.

(D) a tattoo needle is not an inherently dangerous product.

107. When a policeman saw a walker hurrying down the street in the early

morning darkness, he pulled his car over to the curb and ordered the
walker to stop and identify himself. The walker showed the policeman
his license, told him that he lived only a few blocks away, and
explained that he was just taking a walk. When the policeman told the
walker to get into the back of the patrol car, the walker asked whether
he was under arrest. The policeman replied, “No, but if you know
what's good for you, you'll get into the car and shut up while I decide
what to do with you.” The walker got into the car and sat quietly in the
backseat with the door open while the policeman called the walker's
description in to police headquarters over the radio. About 15 minutes
later, satisfied that the walker was not wanted for violating any law,
the policeman told him that he could go. When he was leaving the car,
the walker scraped his finger. If the walker asserts a claim against the
policeman for false imprisonment, the court should find for

(A) the policeman, because the rear door of the policeman's patrol car

remained open all the time that the walker sat in the car.

(B) the policeman, because the walker did not object to sitting in the

patrol car.

(C) the walker, because the language used by the policeman induced the

walker to obey the policeman's order.

(D) the walker, because he sustained damage as a result of his detention

by the policeman.

108. A driver hit a pole, causing a power failure. At the time of the power

failure, a patient was undergoing facial surgery in a hospital operating
room. The hospital's emergency generator went on automatically,
supplying enough electrical power to light the operating room dimly.
The doctor who was operating on the patient was able to complete the
surgery on the patient's face, but the operation left the patient with
permanent and disfiguring scars. If the power had not failed, the doctor
would have been able to prevent the scarring.

If the patient asserts a claim for negligence against the driver, which of
the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one
true, would provide the driver with his most effective defense?

953

(A) The reasonable surgeon in the doctor's position would not have

proceeded with the operation while the operating room was dimly
lit by the hospital's emergency generator.

(B) The reasonable person in the driver's position would not have
anticipated that hitting a pole would affect any person at the
hospital.

(C) The doctor was guilty of aggravated negligence in continuing to
operate on the patient under the circumstances then existing.

(D) The patient's scarring was caused by the conduct of the doctor.

109. The plaintiff and the defendant were sportswriters who wrote for
competing newspapers in the city. Because most of the plaintiff's
articles praised his home team, and most of the defendant's articles
praised his home team, a rivalry developed between the plaintiff and
the defendant. One of the defendant's recent columns contained the
following statement:

[Plaintiff]'s team can't play ball, and [plaintiff] can't write his way out
of  a  paper  bag.  The  only  thing  more  boring  than  reading  [plaintiff]'s
stuff is reading it while watching his team play.

If the plaintiff commences an action for defamation against the
defendant, which of the following would be the defendant's most
effective argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff is a public figure.

(B) The statements made by the defendant were expressions of opinion.

(C) The defendant's occupation makes him a media defendant.

(D) The defendant's statements were privileged by the defense of

competition.

110. A manufacturer built and sold a machine to a steel mill. Two years

later, the steel mill sold the machine to a small computer parts startup.
The manufacturer discovered that a screw in the machine would wear
down and break within three years. It learned the startup had
purchased the machine, and offered to repair the defective screw for
$1,000, which was what it would cost the manufacturer to make the
repair. The startup did not want to spend that much money to fix the
machine. Six months later, the screw snapped and an employee was
injured.

954

The employee sued the manufacturer on a theory of strict liability.
During trial, the jury found the worn screw made the machine
defective when it was sold to the steel mill, the machine had not been
substantially changed since the first sale, and the defective screw was
the proximate cause of the employee's injury. The jury should find in
favor of

(A) the employee, because he was injured by the defective screw.

(B) the employee, because the manufacturer's demand for $1,000 was

unreasonable.

(C) the company, because the machine was removed from the stream of

commerce when the steel mill sold it.

(D) the company, because the startup's refusal to pay the cost of the

repair was unreasonable.

111. At 9 A.M., a man parked his car on a road in front of the play yard of the
elementary school. At the time that he parked the car, the man knew
that he was violating a statute that prohibited parking within two
blocks of any elementary school. At 10 A.M. on the same day, because
she was driving at an unreasonably fast rate of speed, a woman lost
control of her car and struck the man's parked vehicle. The impact
caused a passenger in the woman's car to be thrown against the
windshield, severely cutting her face and rendering her unconscious. If
the man's car had not been parked where it was, the woman would
have collided with a six-foot concrete wall that surrounded the school
play yard.

If the passenger asserts a negligence claim against the man, which of
the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one true,
would be most likely to lead to a judgment for the man?

(A) The statute that prohibited parking within two blocks of any
elementary school was designed to protect schoolchildren.

(B) The accident would not have occurred if the woman had not been

operating her vehicle in an unreasonable manner.

(C) If the woman's car had hit the concrete wall, the passenger would

have sustained injuries as serious as those sustained in the
collision with the man's car.

(D) The woman's unreasonable driving was an intervening cause of

955

harm.

112. A jury found that the plaintiff was damaged to the extent of $100,000.
The jury further found that the plaintiff's damage was caused 20
percent by the plaintiff's negligence, 40 percent by one defendant's
negligence, and 40 percent by another defendant's negligence. The
jurisdiction had a statute that read as follows:

In  a  negligence  action,  no  plaintiff  shall  be  barred  from  recovery
because  of  that  plaintiff's  contributory  negligence,  but  such  plaintiff's
recovery shall be diminished in proportion to plaintiff's own fault.

The court held that the two defendants were jointly and severally
liable for the plaintiff's damage and entered judgment for the plaintiff
consistent with the jury's verdict.

The first defendant became insolvent following the entry of judgment.
How much money is the plaintiff entitled to collect from the second
defendant?

(A) $100,000.

(B) $80,000 ($100,000 less 20 percent).

(C) $40,000 (40 percent of $100,000).

(D) None.

113. While the plaintiff was shopping at a sporting goods store owned by

the defendant, another customer assaulted the plaintiff with a baseball
bat. The plaintiff sued the defendant for his damages. The could should
find

(A) the defendant liable under the principle of vicarious liability.

(B) the defendant liable under the principle of general liability.

(C) the defendant liable under the principle of strict liability.

(D) the defendant not liable.

114. A magazine contained an article about the recent sale of an old house

that had once been owned by a United States President. The article
stated that the home had been purchased by the plaintiff for $950,000.
It described the plaintiff as a bank president earning a salary of
$100,000 per year and stated that she had purchased the home with
part of the $1 million fortune that she inherited from her mother.

956

Writers of the article had obtained information about the sale from
public records of the Office of the County Recorder. Information about
the plaintiff's employment and salary had been obtained from public
records of the state Department of Banks, and information about her
inheritance from public records of the state Probate Court. All
statements made in the article were accurate.

The plaintiff asserts a claim for invasion of privacy on the ground that
the article publicly disclosed facts about her salary and inheritance.
The court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because most members of the general public were

unfamiliar with records of the state Department of Banks and the
state Probate Court.

(B) the plaintiff, because there is no right to publish information

regarding the personal wealth of a person who is not a public
employee.

(C) the magazine, because liability cannot be imposed for publication

of the truth.

(D) the magazine, because the plaintiff's salary and inheritance were a

matter of public record.

115. A landowner lived in a cabin in the area. After a nearby factory began
using unbagged cement, cement dust from the factory's operation
continually settled on the cabin that the landowner occupied. Although
the dust did no physical harm to the cabin or to the landowner, the
landowner complained to officials of the factory that the dust annoyed
her. Because the factory received no other complaints from other area
residents, however, it continued using unbagged cement.

If the landowner wishes to assert a tort claim against the factory on
account of the cement dust that continually settles on the cabin, which
of the following would be her most effective theory?

(A) Invasion of privacy.

(B) Public nuisance.

(C) Trespass to land.

(D) Strict liability for engaging in an abnormally dangerous activity.

116. An employee was driving a pickup truck owned by the company when

957

he collided with an automobile owned and operated by a driver. A
passenger in the driver's car subsequently asserted a claim against the
company, the employee, and the driver for injuries sustained in the
accident. At trial, the jury fixed the amount of the passenger's damages
and found that the employee was 40 percent at fault, the driver was 60
percent at fault, and the passenger was not at fault. In issuing a
judgment for the passenger, the court held that the employee and the
driver were jointly and severally liable for the passenger's injuries
and that the company was vicariously liable for the employee's tort.
The jurisdiction had statutes that adopted pure comparative negligence
and recognized a right of contribution between joint tortfeasors.

In enforcing the judgment, what portion of her damages is the
passenger entitled to collect from the employee?

(A) 0 percent

(B) 40 percent

(C) 50 percent

(D) 100 percent

117. In a negligence action by the plaintiff against two defendants, the court
found that the plaintiff's injuries were proximately caused by the
combined negligence of the two defendants and that they were jointly
and severally liable to the plaintiff in the sum of $100,000. The court
also found that in producing the plaintiff's injury, the first defendant
was 40 percent at fault and the second defendant was 60 percent at
fault. The jurisdiction has a statute recognizing the right of contribution
between joint tortfeasors, and that contribution shall be based on
apportionment of fault.

After the entry of judgment, the plaintiff succeeded in collecting
$10,000 from the first defendant. Which of the following correctly
states the amount that the plaintiff is entitled to collect from the second
defendant?

(A) $50,000 (60 percent of $100,000 minus $10,000 already

collected).

(B) $60,000 (60 percent of $100,000).

(C) $90,000 ($100,000 minus $10,000 already collected).

958

(D) $100,000.

118. A plaintiff was in an auto accident with the defendant. After a jury

trial, the jury found that the plaintiff's damage was $100,000. The jury
also found the accident was 25 percent the fault of the defendant, and
75 percent the fault of the plaintiff. A statute in the relevant jurisdiction
imposes a system of pure comparative negligence.

Based on the jury's findings, the court should enter judgment for

(A) the defendant, because he was only 25 percent at fault.

(B) the plaintiff, in the amount of $25,000.

(C) the plaintiff, in the amount of $75,000.

(D) the plaintiff, in the amount of $100,000.

119. During the course of an argument about politics, the defendant slapped
the plaintiff in the face. Angry, the plaintiff pointed an unloaded pistol
at the defendant. The defendant immediately drew a knife and stabbed
the plaintiff with it, injuring him severely. The plaintiff subsequently
asserted a battery claim against the defendant. The only defense raised
by the defendant was self-defense.

In determining the defendant's liability to the plaintiff, the most
important issue that must be decided is whether

(A) the use of a knife by the defendant constituted deadly force.

(B) the defendant knew or should have known that he could safely and

easily retreat without sustaining harm.

(C) the defendant was the initial aggressor.

(D) the plaintiff knew that his pistol was unloaded.

120. The defendant kept an extremely tame lion as a pet. The lion had

worked in a circus for most of its life and had never attacked anyone in
all the years it was performing. Now, the lion was old, practically
blind, and had lost all of its teeth. Without any negligence by the
defendant, the lion escaped from the defendant's backyard and walked
to the plaintiff's home, which was over one mile away. Finding the
front door open and smelling some steak cooking, the lion walked
through the front door and into the plaintiff's kitchen. When the plaintiff
saw the lion she panicked and dropped a boiling pot of grease onto her

959

foot. She suffered severe burns as a result. The plaintiff sued the
defendant for damages. The court should find

(A) the defendant not liable because the lion had never shown any

propensity to harm a person.

(B) the defendant not liable because the defendant was not negligent.

(C) the defendant not liable because the injury was not the result of the

lion's dangerous propensities.

(D) the defendant liable for the plaintiff's injuries.

121. The owner of a supermarket purchased an automatic door-opener from

its manufacturer. The device included rubber step-plates that were to
be installed on the floor on both sides of the door. When a person
stepped on one of the step-plates, the machine was designed to swing
the door away from him or her.

The store owner hired a contractor to install the automatic door-
opener while the store was closed for the night. The contractor read
the instructions furnished by the manufacturer but disregarded the
warnings. When he finished installing the device, he did not test it by
stepping on one of the step-plates but advised the store's night manager
that the job was complete. The following morning when the store
opened, a customer was injured by the door.

The customer asserted a claim for his injuries against the store owner.
Which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
customer?

(A) The customer's injury resulted from a defect in the step-plate.

(B) The contractor was not negligent in his installation of the automatic

door-opener.

(C) A reasonable inspection by the store owner would have disclosed

that the door opened improperly.

(D) The customer made a purchase from the store owner before being

struck by the door.

122. The plaintiff, an adult, took his neighbor's seven-year-old son to see

the circus. During the show, many children left their seats to watch the
performance from the edge of the area on which it took place. The boy

960

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

did so with the plaintiff's permission. When the circus's trained lions
were performing, one of the animals got away from its enclosure and
struck the boy with its paw, injuring him. Horrified, the plaintiff ran
from his seat and chased the lion away from the boy. The plaintiff was
not touched by the lion but became highly nervous as a result of the
incident. The circus knew that the lions would often attack people. The
jurisdiction applied the doctrine of transferred intent.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim for battery against the circus, the court
should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the jurisdiction applies the doctrine of

transferred intent.

(B) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff experienced mental suffering as a

result of harmful contact inflicted upon the boy.

(C) the circus, because the plaintiff was not touched by the lion.

(D) the circus, because the circus knew that the lions would attack a

member of the audience when the circus exhibited them.

123. One weekend, while the plaintiff's son was visiting with her ex-

husband, a friend of the plaintiff's phoned her. The friend said that she
heard that the ex-husband was planning to remove the boy from the
state permanently.

Panicked, the plaintiff ran to the home of the ex-husband's father and
pounded on the door. When the ex-husband's father came to the door,
the plaintiff demanded, in a loud voice, that the ex-husband's father tell
her where her ex-husband and her son were. The ex-husband's father
knew that the ex-husband had taken the boy to the movies and would
soon be returning. Because the plaintiff's manner frightened him,
however, the ex-husband's father said that he had no idea where they
were or when they were coming back and refused to talk to the
plaintiff any further.

As a result, the plaintiff became highly upset. She visited her
physician, who prescribed a mild tranquilizer, but she remained
nervous until the ex-husband brought the boy to her home that evening.

The plaintiff asserted a claim against the ex-husband's father for false
imprisonment. The court should find for

961

(A) the ex-husband's father, because the plaintiff sustained no physical

injury as a result of the incident.

(B) the ex-husband's father, because he did not prevent the plaintiff

from leaving his home.

(C) the plaintiff, because she was legally entitled to custody of the boy.

(D) the plaintiff, because the ex-husband's father prevented her from

seeing or communicating with the boy.

124. The defendant's car struck and killed a boy, flinging the child and his

tricycle through the air.

The plaintiff was standing in her living room when she heard the
screech of the defendant's brakes. Glancing out through her window,
she saw the boy's bloody body fly through the air and land on her front
lawn. The plaintiff was so shocked by what she saw that she suffered a
heart attack and needed to be hospitalized for several weeks.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from mental distress that she experienced because of the
incident, which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if it
was the only one true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for
the plaintiff?

(A) The reasonable person would have expected someone to be in the
plaintiff's position and to experience mental suffering as a result of
the incident.

(B) The jurisdiction applies the doctrine of transferred intent.

(C) The jurisdiction applies the doctrine of transferred consequences.

(D) The reasonable person would regard the defendant's speed as

outrageous.

125. A homeowner hired a painter to paint the outside of the homeowner's

house. While doing so, the painter left his ladder unattended on the
front lawn.

Two days later, a government employee was walking across the
homeowner's lawn while delivering mail. On several occasions in the
past, the homeowner had asked her to use the sidewalk and not to walk
on his lawn. The homeowner saw the employee walking toward the

962

painter's ladder on his lawn but did not warn the employee because he
believed that she saw it. Although the lawn had recently been mowed
and the ladder was in plain view, the employee did not see the ladder
and tripped over it, injuring her knee.

The jurisdiction applies the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence.

If the employee asserts a negligence claim against the homeowner for
damages resulting from her injury, which of the following would be
the homeowner's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The homeowner did not know with certainty that the employee

would be injured.

(B) The dangerous condition was created by the painter.

(C) The homeowner believed that the employee knew that the ladder

was there.

(D) A landowner owes no duty to government employees entering on

official business.

126. Six months after a doctor performed surgery on her, a patient was X-

rayed by another doctor. The X-ray disclosed a surgical instrument
inside the patient's chest. The first doctor was the only person who had
ever performed surgery on the patient. The patient subsequently
asserted a medical malpractice claim against the doctor, alleging that
the doctor had negligently left the surgical instrument inside her while
operating on her.

If an expert testifies that surgeons do not usually leave instruments
inside a patient's body unless they are acting unreasonably, may the
patient rely on res ipsa loquitur in her claim against the doctor?

(A) No, because the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not applicable to a

claim for professional malpractice.

(B) No, because a jury of laypersons is not competent to infer that a

physician was negligent.

(C) Yes, because a surgeon is under an absolute duty not to leave

instruments inside a patient's body.

(D) Yes, because the doctor was the only person who had ever

963

performed surgery on the patient.

127. The defendants were driving their vehicles in an unreasonable manner

when they collided. The collision caused the first driver's vehicle to
strike and injure a pedestrian who was crossing the street in the middle
of the block. The pedestrian was hospitalized as a result of the
accident, but he had hospitalization insurance that paid $10,000
toward his hospital bill.

The pedestrian subsequently asserted a claim against both defendants.
At the trial, in response to the judge's instructions, the jury found that
the pedestrian sustained damages of $100,000, and that the accident
resulted 40 percent from the negligence of the first driver, 40 percent
from the negligence of the second driver, and 20 percent from the
negligence of the pedestrian. The judge ruled that the defendants were
jointly and severally liable to the pedestrian and entered judgment in
accordance with the jury's verdict.

Which of the following statements correctly describes the amount that
the pedestrian is entitled to collect from the first driver in a
jurisdiction that has a pure comparative negligence statute?

(A) $100,000 reduced by 20 percent.

(B) $100,000 reduced by $10,000 and further reduced by 20 percent.

(C) 40 percent of $100,000.

(D) 40 percent of the amount derived by subtracting $10,000 from

$100,000.

128. The defendant, a power company, built a large nuclear power plant. It
did so with utmost care, and the plant went far beyond the safety
measures required by federal guidelines. The plant sat on the edge of a
small harbor that had a beach that was extremely popular for fishing.
The plaintiff went to the harbor every day to fish. Because the plaintiff
was also extremely proud of his dark tan, he fished with his shirt off,
surrounded by mirrors he placed in the sand so the sun reached all
sides of his body evenly. After three years, the plaintiff developed an
extremely rare form of cancer that was linked to radiation escaping
from the plant. The radiation leak was so small that it could not be
detected, and in fact was only discovered because the plaintiff became
sick. If the plaintiff had not fished surrounded by mirrors, it was
unlikely he would have gotten sick or that the leak would have been

964

discovered at all. The plaintiff sued the defendant for his injuries.
During trial, the defendant proved that it was not negligent in any way.
The jurisdiction used common law contributory negligence principles.
The court should rule in favor of

(A) the defendant, because the defendant was not negligent.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff's use of the mirrors was

contributory negligence.

(C) the defendant, because the leak was impossible to discover before

the plaintiff was injured.

(D) the plaintiff.

129. One evening in a tavern, a 17-year-old girl drank alcoholic beverages.
The girl then left and went to the tavern next door, where she drank
alcoholic beverages. The girl attempted to ride home on her
motorcycle. Because the girl was intoxicated, she struck and injured a
pedestrian. The pedestrian subsequently asserted claims against both
taverns under a state law that provides as follows: “If a minor under
the age of 20 years injures another while intoxicated, any person who
sold said minor the alcohol that resulted in said minor's intoxication
shall be liable to the injured person.”

The first tavern did not sell the girl enough alcohol to make the girl
intoxicated, and the alcohol that the second tavern sold the girl would
have made the girl intoxicated even if the first tavern had sold the girl
no alcohol at all. In determining the pedestrian's claim against the
second tavern, the court should find that

(A) the second tavern's conduct was not the cause of the girl's

intoxication because the first tavern's conduct was a substantial
factor in making the girl intoxicated.

(B) the second tavern is liable under the statute even if the second
tavern's conduct did not cause the girl to become intoxicated.

(C) the second tavern's conduct was a cause of the pedestrian's injury
because the girl would not have become intoxicated if the second
tavern did not sell the girl alcoholic beverages.

(D) the second tavern's conduct was a cause of the girl's intoxication
but was not a cause of the pedestrian's injury because the girl's
driving superseded it.

965

130. A contractor told the landowner that she did not think that one pillar

would provide sufficient support for the landowner's staircase. When
the landowner discussed the contractor's objection with the architect,
however, the architect insisted that one pillar would be sufficient. The
landowner told this to the contractor and convinced the contractor to
rely on the architect's plan.

The contractor completed the building as agreed and turned it over to
the landowner on April 1. Two weeks later, the landowner hired a
mover to move a piano onto the second floor of the house. While the
mover was carrying the piano up the staircase, the staircase collapsed,
causing the mover to sustain injury. If the staircase had been supported
by two columns, it would not have collapsed.

If the mover asserts a negligence claim against the contractor, the court
should declare that

(A) the contractor assumed the risk because she supported the stairway
with only one pillar even though she was aware of the danger of
doing so.

(B) the contractor is not liable because she had turned the building over

to the landowner prior to the accident.

(C) the contractor is not liable because it was reasonable for her to rely

on the architect's instructions in constructing the stairway.

(D) the contractor absolved herself of the risk by objecting to

supporting the stairway with only one pillar.

131. A man was obviously intoxicated when he entered a bartender's tavern

one night and ordered a drink of whiskey. A statute in the jurisdiction
prohibits serving alcoholic liquor to any intoxicated person. The
bartender knew that the man was intoxicated, but because the man was
a good customer, the bartender opened a new bottle and poured him
some of it. After drinking the liquor, the man left the tavern and began
driving home.

Before the whiskey left the factory, an angry employee added a poison
to it that could not have been discovered by reasonable inspection.
While the man was driving in a reasonable manner, the poison caused
him to die. As a result, the man's car struck a pedestrian, injuring her.

966

If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the factory, the court should
find for

(A) the factory, because the employee deliberately poisoned the liquor

before it left the factory.

(B) the factory, because the pedestrian did not purchase or consume the

factory's product.

(C) the pedestrian, because the liquor contained poison when it left the

factory.

(D) the factory, because the poison could not have been detected by

reasonable inspection.

132. Pursuant to a contract with the federal government, a rocket company
manufactured and launched rockets used for placing communications
satellites into space. Shortly after the rocket company launched one of
its rockets, the rocket exploded in the air. It then crashed into a storage
building owned by a medical company that contained antibiotics with a
value of $180 million, totally destroying the building and its contents.
No one could determine the cause of the explosion. Although the rocket
company used reasonable care in all aspects of the manufacturing and
launching process, a few of the rocket company's rockets had exploded
in the past shortly after launch. Each time this happened, the rocket
involved was completely destroyed while in the air and caused no
damage on the ground.

If the medical company asserts a claim against the rocket company for
the loss of its building and contents, the court should find for

(A) the medical company, because the construction and launching of

rockets is an abnormally dangerous activity.

(B) the medical company, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.

(C) the rocket company, because the reasonable person would not

expect antibiotics worth $180 million to be stored in one building.

(D) the rocket company, because none of the rocket company's rockets

caused any damage on the ground in the past.

133. Due to an error at its factory, a company sold an airline a belt truck

that did not have an acceleration suppressor.

Two months later, the airline went out of business and sold the belt

967

truck to a second airline. An independent contractor hired by the
second airline to maintain the second airline's equipment set the belt
idle above 15. Doing so can cause the truck to lurch forward unless it
is equipped with an acceleration suppressor. The company was aware
that people who maintain the trucks often set the idle above 15.
Subsequently, an employee of the second airline attempted to activate
the belt while standing beside the belt truck. She was injured when the
belt truck lurched forward and struck her.

The employee asserts a claim against the company on the ground that
the absence of an acceleration suppressor made the belt truck
defective. The court should find for

(A) the company, because the first airline was negligent in failing to

discover that the belt truck was not equipped with an acceleration
suppressor.

(B) the company, because if the contractor had acted reasonably in
setting the belt idle, the employee would not have been injured.

(C) the employee, because persons who maintain belt trucks frequently

set the belt idle above 15.

(D) the employee, because the negligence of the contractor is imputed

to the company.

134. A company operated a manufacturing plant just outside the town,

making an insecticide that was very important to the state's orange
crop. Breezes frequently carried fumes from the company's plant into
the town. Although the fumes did not violate state air pollution laws,
they caused many buildings in the town to need frequent repainting and
led many homeowners to complain about it to the company. The
company did nothing about it, however, because the cost of eliminating
the fumes was extremely high.

A homeowner, who owned a house in the town in which he resided
with his son, had to repaint his house several times because of the
fumes.

The homeowner asserted a private nuisance claim against the company
for the damage to his paint, asserting that the company was negligent in
failing to eliminate the fumes. Which of the following would be the
company's most effective argument in defense against the homeowner's

968

claim?

(A) The operation of the company's plant did not result in a physical

invasion of the homeowner's realty.

(B) The fumes affected others in substantially the same way as they

affected the homeowner.

(C) The company officials did not know that the fumes would affect the

paint of the homeowner's house.

(D) The cost of eliminating the fumes would have driven the company

out of business.

135. A company was the manufacturer of a product that was sold over the

counter for the treatment of dandruff and dry scalp conditions. The
plaintiff purchased a bottle at a local drugstore. A statement on the
label read, “This product will not harm normal scalp or hair.” The
plaintiff used the product as directed. Because of a scalp condition
making him allergic to one of the ingredients, the product irritated his
scalp, causing him much pain and discomfort.

In an action by the plaintiff against the company on the theory of strict
liability in tort, which of the following additional facts or inferences,
if it was the only one true, would be most helpful to the plaintiff's
case?

(A) Injuries of the kind sustained by the plaintiff do not ordinarily result
from the use of a product like this one unless the manufacturer was
negligent.

(B) Prior to the plaintiff's purchase of the product, an article regarding
the allergy from which he suffered had appeared in a widely read
journal of the hair-care industry.

(C) The ordinary consumer would not have expected the use of the

product to result in an irritation of the scalp of someone with the
plaintiff's allergy.

(D) At the time it manufactured the product purchased by the plaintiff,
the company was aware that its ingredients could irritate the scalp
of persons with allergies like the plaintiff's.

136. The city sidewalk in front of the defendant's business was often

covered with leaves that made the sidewalk slippery. To try to fix
matters, the defendant made a deal with the city, giving the defendant

969

possession and control of the trees. The defendant then swept the
leaves off the sidewalk every morning. One morning, the defendant
failed to sweep, and the plaintiff, who was walking into the business
on his way to a meeting, slipped on the leaves and fell, cracking his
head open. The plaintiff was texting on his phone when he fell, but he
had walked into the building every day for weeks and reasonably
believed that the leaves would be swept because of the past conduct of
the defendant. The plaintiff sued, and the defendant defended himself
by asserting he had no duty to sweep the leaves off the sidewalk under
the circumstances.

How should the court rule?

(A) In favor of the defendant, because the sidewalk was city property.

(B) In favor of the defendant, because the plaintiff was texting when he

fell.

(C) In favor of the plaintiff, because the defendant had possession and

control of the trees.

(D) In favor of the plaintiff, because the defendant's past conduct made

the plaintiff reasonably believe the leaves would be swept

137. A farmer owned 500 acres of land on which she grew wheat. By a
valid written contract, she agreed to deliver all her wheat to a
company to be used by that company in the production of bread for
sale to the general public. While harvesting the crop, she realized that
a blade on her harvesting machine was broken and that fine slivers of
metal were becoming mixed with the wheat. She said nothing about
this when she delivered the wheat to the company, since she knew that
the company ordinarily cleaned its wheat before using it.

The bread company used the wheat that it purchased from the farmer to
manufacture a loaf of bread that it sold to a sandwich shop. The
sandwich shop owner used the bread to make a sandwich. Because the
bread contained slivers of the blade from the farmer's harvesting
machine, the customer who bought the sandwich lacerated the lining of
his throat when he tried to eat it.

In an action by the customer against the bread company, can the
customer successfully rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur?

(A) Yes, because the exercise of reasonable care in the baking process

970

would ordinarily have eliminated all metal slivers from the wheat.

(B) Yes, because the presence of metal slivers made the bread

defective.

(C) No, because the presence of the metal slivers in the wheat resulted

from the farmer's failure to use reasonable care.

(D) No, because it was unforeseeable that a broken blade on the

farmer's harvesting machine would result in the presence of metal
slivers in the wheat.

138. A kidnapper falsely claimed he was holding a girl hostage. In reality,
the girl was on a camping trip. The girl's mother remained in a
hysterical state until the girl returned from her camping trip and the
girl's mother realized that it had been a hoax. The girl's mother, who
already suffered from a heart ailment, had a heart attack the day after
the girl's return.

If the girl's mother asserts a claim against the kidnapper for damages
resulting from her heart attack on a theory of intentional infliction of
emotional distress, the court should find for

(A) the kidnapper, because the heart attack occurred the day after the

girl's return.

(B) the kidnapper, because the mother's preexisting condition made her

especially susceptible to heart attack.

(C) the girl's mother, because the heart attack was caused by the

kidnapper's outrageous conduct.

(D) the girl's mother, because the kidnapper should have foreseen that

his conduct would result in harm.

139. While the plaintiff was visiting her daughter, the two of them decided
to go swimming at a nearby public pool. Since she had not brought a
bathing suit along on her visit, the plaintiff went to a department store
to purchase one. While looking at the suits on the bargain counter, she
found one made by a bathing suit company. The package that contained
it bore a label that read, “Disposable Bathing Suit. This garment is
made completely from recycled paper. Although it is strong enough to
be worn several times and is even washable, it's inexpensive enough
to be thrown away after one use.” The plaintiff bought the suit and then
went to the beach. The first time she was hit by a wave, however, the

971

suit completely disintegrated.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most helpful to the department store's defense
in an action by the plaintiff against the department store?

(A) The department store had sold the bathing suit company's products
for several years and had never heard of any problem like the one
experienced by the plaintiff.

(B) A sign on the bargain counter where the plaintiff found the suit said,

“Sale Merchandise. All sales final.”

(C) The plaintiff knew that paper bathing suits like the one she had
purchased sometimes dissolved when they became wet.

(D) The department store could not implead the bathing suit company
into the action because the company had gone out of business.

140. A 13-year-old boy and his family lived on a farm in a very remote

portion of the state. Because of the lack of automobile traffic, the boy's
parents let him ride a motorcycle between the family farm and the
local grocery store. There was no statute or ordinance that prohibited
the boy's use of the motorcycle. One morning, there was heavy fog on
the ground when the boy drove the motorcycle to the store. The speed
limit was 35 miles per hour. While a reasonable adult would have
known to drive under the speed limit because of the poor visibility, a
reasonable 13-year-old would not normally have such knowledge. The
boy drove the motorcycle at 35 miles an hour and crashed into a car
when he was unable to slow down in time. The boy did not expect a
car to be on the road, because cars were so rarely around. The car
owner sued the boy for negligence. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the car owner, because the boy was driving a motorcycle.

(B) the car owner, because a reasonable adult would have known to

drive under the speed limit.

(C) the boy, because a reasonable 13-year-old would not normally

know to drive under the speed limit.

(D) the boy, because he was driving at the speed limit.

141. The company manufactured a device for training dogs. A professional

dog trainer was working with a dog in her unfenced front yard and was
using the company's brand new device. A man was walking past the

972

yard when the dog began to snarl and lunge at him. When the trainer
yanked on the leather strap of the device, it suddenly broke, freeing the
dog. The dog sprang forward, biting the walker.

If the walker asserts a claim against the dog trainer, the walker's most
effective argument in support of his claim would be that

(A) the dog trainer is strictly liable for damage resulting from her use

of a defective product.

(B) it was unreasonable for the dog trainer to work the dog in her front

yard.

(C) the dog trainer's conduct was a concurring cause of harm.

(D) the dog trainer was a professional dog trainer.

142. Because the plaintiff had a headache, he took two headache tablets

from a bottle that had been purchased by his wife at the grocery store.
The tablets had been manufactured by the company, which sold them to
the grocery store in sealed bottles for resale. Because of a toxic
ingredient that the tablets contained, the plaintiff became ill as a result
of taking them.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the company based on a theory of
strict liability in tort, the ruling should turn on the question of whether

(A) the company knew that the tablets contained a toxic ingredient.

(B) headache tablets that contain a toxic ingredient are inherently

dangerous.

(C) it was reasonable for the company to market the tablets.

(D) the presence of the toxic material was a defect.

143. A driver was looking for an address as he drove down the street and

was not watching the road in front of him. As a result, he did not see a
pedestrian crossing the street in front of him and struck her with his
car, knocking her down. The driver immediately got out of her car to
help the pedestrian. When he saw that she was unconscious, he became
afraid to move her and left her in the roadway while he ran to a nearby
phone. While the driver was gone, a taxi drove down the same street.
The taxi did not see the pedestrian in the roadway, and drove over her,
fracturing her leg.

973

In an action by the pedestrian against the driver for damages resulting
from her fractured leg, a court is most likely to find for

(A) the pedestrian, because the driver's negligence was a factual and

legal cause of the pedestrian's fractured leg.

(B) the pedestrian, since the negligence of the taxi is imputed to the

driver.

(C) the driver, since his conduct was a legal cause but not a factual

cause of the pedestrian's fractured leg.

(D) the driver, because the pedestrian would not have been injured but

for the taxi striking her.

144. An employee resigned after being told he wouldn't be compensated for
extra work hours. At the same time, he told his former employer he
would retain a set of tools issued to him until he received payment.
The employee applied for a job with another company, and that
company wrote to the former employer asking for an evaluation of the
employee's honesty and ability. The former employer wrote a letter to
the other company that stated, “When the employee left my company,
he stole a valuable set of tools.” As a result, the other company did not
hire the employee. If the employee asserts a claim against his former
employer for defamation, the employee should

(A) lose, because the employee did not return the tools that he took

when he left the employer's employ.

(B) lose, because the employer's statement was made in response to a

specific request by the employee's prospective employer.

(C) win, because the employer's statement could not have benefitted the

employer's business interests.

(D) win, because the employer's statement accused the employee of

stealing tools.

145. The defendant operated a train carrying high explosives used to blow

tunnels through mountains. As the train was passing through a city, it hit
the plaintiff, who had ducked through the lowered train-crossing bars
and was trying to get across the tracks to the other side before he was
blocked by the train. The plaintiff was severely injured. The plaintiff
sued the defendant for his damages. During trial, the defendant proved
that it was not negligent in any way. The jurisdiction followed
comparative negligence principles. The court should rule in favor of

974

(A) the plaintiff, under the doctrine of strict liability.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff assumed the risk of getting hit

by the train.

(C) the defendant, because it was not negligent.

(D) the defendant, because the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by

trying to cross the tracks.

146. The seller knew that his car's engine was cracked. Because he wanted

to sell the car, he filled the crack with putty and painted it so that the
crack would not show. He then sold the car to a used car dealer. The
next day, the used car dealer was showing the car to a customer when
the crack caused the engine to explode, injuring the customer.

If the customer asserts a claim against the seller for injuries that he
sustained when the engine exploded, which of the following would be
the customer's most effective theory?

(A) Battery, because the seller knew that the engine was cracked.

(B) Intentional misrepresentation, because the seller knew that the

engine was cracked.

(C) Negligent misrepresentation, because the seller had a duty to

disclose that the engine was cracked.

(D) Negligence, because the seller should have anticipated that a

customer of the used car dealer would be injured as a result of the
cracked engine.

147. The defendant negligently burned down a restaurant when he used a

highly flammable cleaner to clean the restaurant's deep fryer. The
defendant was an independent contractor hired to clean the restaurant
and he owned no interest in the restaurant. The plaintiff, a waiter at the
restaurant, was laid off because of the fire damage and could not get a
job for six months. The plaintiff sued the defendant for his financial
losses from his joblessness. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the defendant, because the plaintiff suffered only economic harm.

(B) the defendant, because he owned no interest in the restaurant.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant's negligence caused him to be

laid off.

975

(D) the plaintiff, because the defendant's negligence burned down the

restaurant.

148. A natural gas factory was located on the edge of the city. When the

wind blew from the east, foul-smelling waste gases from the factory's
chimneys were blown over the city, causing most of the residents to
experience a burning of the eyes and throat. On several occasions, a
city resident attempted to persuade the city attorney to seek an
injunction against the factory. The city attorney refused, however,
because the city council was afraid that doing so would drive the
factory from the area. If the resident seeks an injunction by asserting a
claim against the factory on a theory of public nuisance, which of the
following would be the factory's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The city attorney's decision is binding.

(B) The resident has not sustained harm different from that of the

general public.

(C) A private citizen may not seek an injunction against environmental

polluters.

(D) A private citizen may not sue on a theory of public nuisance.

149. A trucker was eating cherry pie in a restaurant when a cherry pit

contained in the pie stuck in his throat. Unable to breathe, the trucker
began choking. A doctor who was eating in the restaurant ran to the
trucker's aid and performed an operation known as an emergency
tracheotomy. Then, at the doctor's direction, the trucker walked across
the street to a hospital. The hospital's emergency room had famously
long waits. Because hospital employees negligently failed to enter the
trucker's name in the emergency room register, he sat in the emergency
room for six hours without further attention. At that time, an earthquake
caused a portion of the hospital's structure to fall, striking the trucker
in the head and fracturing his skull. An earthquake had never occurred
in the state before.

Assume that the doctor's conduct in performing the emergency
tracheotomy was unreasonable, and if the doctor had acted reasonably,
the trucker would have coughed up the pit without any injury. In an
action by the trucker against the doctor for damages resulting from his
fractured skull, will the trucker win?

(A) Yes, since he would not have been in the hospital if the doctor had

976

not performed the tracheotomy.

(B) Yes, because it was foreseeable that the trucker would be required

to wait six hours in the hospital's emergency room.

(C) No, since he would not have been injured were it not for the cherry

pit contained in the pie.

(D) No, because the earthquake was a superseding cause of the

trucker's injury.

150. In answer to specific questions posed by the court, the jury found that
an accident was 60 percent the fault of the plaintiff and 40 percent the
fault of the defendant. In addition, the jury found that damage to
plaintiff's car amounted to $1,000, and that damage to the defendant's
car amounted to $10,000.

The jurisdiction had a statute that provided that “In any negligence
action, a plaintiff's recovery shall not be barred by that plaintiff's fault,
but the recovery of said plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to
such plaintiff's fault, unless that plaintiff's fault shall be greater than
that of the defendant, and in such event the plaintiff's recovery shall be
barred.” Which of the following correctly states the sum to which the
plaintiff is entitled?

(A) $600 ($1,000 less 40 percent).

(B) $400 ($1,000 less 60 percent).

(C) $1,000.

(D) 0.

151. The landlord was the owner of a four-story office building. An

attorney in the landlord's building knew that the elevator was broken,
but decided to take one of his client's up in it anyway. The landlord
had promised the attorney he would fix it, but the landlord did not do
so. When the attorney and the client were riding in the elevator, it
suddenly dropped, injuring the client.

The client asserted a claim against the landlord for damages resulting
from his injuries, alleging that the landlord was negligent in failing to
fix the elevator or warn the client about it. Which of the following
would be the landlord's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The landlord did not owe the client a duty to repair the elevator

977

since the landlord's promise was not made to the client.

(B) The client was a mere licensee since his presence did not confer a

benefit on the landlord.

(C) It was not foreseeable that the attorney would permit the client to
use the elevator since the attorney knew it was not working
properly.

(D) It was unreasonable for the attorney to permit the client to use the
elevator since the attorney knew that it was not working properly.

152. A licensed exterminator bought a large container of insecticide. The
label said it should only be used by professional exterminators. The
exterminator placed the container on a shelf in his shop, where it was
discovered by a janitor. Since the janitor thought there were termites in
his house, he opened the container and poured some of the chemical
pellets into a plastic bag that he then brought home. The next day, the
janitor's three-year-old daughter found the plastic bag containing the
pellets and ate some of them, becoming seriously ill as a result. A
statute in the jurisdiction adopted the all-or-nothing rule of
contributory negligence.

In an action by the daughter against the exterminator, which of the
following would be the daughter's most effective argument?

(A) The exterminator should have foreseen that the insecticide would
cause injury to someone in the daughter's position if left on an
exposed shelf in his shop.

(B) The insecticide was defective since its label did not adequately

warn of the dangers connected with its use.

(C) The insecticide is an inherently dangerous product.

(D) The janitor's theft of the pellets was a concurring cause of his

daughter's harm.

153. After living together for several months, a man and his girlfriend began
to argue frequently. On Monday, after an argument, the man left their
apartment in anger, saying that he didn't know when he was coming
back. The following Saturday, the girlfriend took all the man's
possessions, including his television set, to a swap meet in hopes of
selling them. At the swap meet, she sold the television to a neighbor.

978

If the man instituted an action against his former girlfriend for trespass
to chattel, which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if
it was the only one true, would be most helpful to the girlfriend's
defense?

(A) The man's leaving the apartment constituted implied consent to the

girlfriend's sale of his possessions.

(B) The girlfriend's interference with the man's right to the television

was serious enough to justify a forced sale.

(C) The neighbor committed a conversion by purchasing the television

set at the swap meet.

(D) At the time the man's action against her was instituted, the girlfriend

could not reacquire possession of the television set from the
neighbor.

154. The plaintiff and the defendant lived on the same street and worked in
the same office, so they formed a car pool, each driving his own car on
alternate days. One day while the defendant was driving, the car in
front of him stopped suddenly and without warning. Since the
defendant had taken his eyes off the road for a moment to look at the
plaintiff, he was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of the
stopped car. The plaintiff was injured as a result of the collision.

There was no automobile guest statute in the jurisdiction. In an action
by the plaintiff against the defendant, which of the following would be
the defendant's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff assumed the risk since he knew that it was possible
that the defendant's car would be involved in an accident while
traveling to work.

(B) The defendant's conduct was not a cause-in-fact of harm since the
accident would not have occurred if the car in front of him had not
stopped suddenly.

(C) The defendant did not owe the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care

since the plaintiff was a licensee.

(D) It was not negligent for the defendant to take his eyes off the road

for a moment.

155. After an accident, a woman was trapped in her car. The fire chief told
a volunteer firefighter to use a new device to free her. He knew the

979

device could be dangerous, and that the volunteer firefighter had not
been trained in how to use it. The volunteer firefighter used the device
improperly, injuring the woman.

If the woman instituted an action against the fire chief, the woman's
best theory would be

(A) negligence.

(B) battery.

(C) strict products liability.

(D) res ipsa loquitur.

156. As a result of her neighbor's negligence, the plaintiff's shoulder and
eye were both injured. The plaintiff went immediately to her eye
doctor. The eye doctor treated the injury to the plaintiff's eye but
suggested that she see an orthopedist for treatment of her shoulder. The
following day, the plaintiff visited an orthopedist, who treated the
plaintiff's shoulder.

Because of negligent treatment by the eye doctor, the plaintiff's nose
became infected, and because of negligent treatment by the
orthopedist, she lost the use of her elbow.

In an action by the plaintiff against her neighbor, which of the
following parts of the plaintiff's body is a court most likely to find
were injured as a proximate result of the neighbor's negligence?

(A) Her nose.

(B) Her elbow.

(C) Both her nose and elbow.

(D) Neither her nose nor her elbow.

157. A newspaper incorrectly stated that a local minister was a minister for

a group that was historically perceived as a cult engaged in unlawful
activities. Which of the following is a court most likely to find about
the statement?

(A) The statement is not defamatory if the group can be classified as a

religion under the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution.

980

(B) The statement is not defamatory if members of the group do not

currently engage in improper activities.

(C) The statement is not defamatory if a substantial group of right-

thinking people know that members of the group no longer engage
in improper activities.

(D) The statement is defamatory if many people continue to believe that

members of the group engage in improper activities.

158. A company was in the business of developing and manufacturing

machinery used in other industries.

A warehouse employee was injured when a pin in one of the
company's machines wore out. The company knew that a pin failure
was dangerous. The employee instituted a negligence action against
the company that made the machine. The company's defense was based
on the assertion that prior to the accident, the company neither knew
nor reasonably could have known that the pin would wear out. If the
jury believes this assertion, the employee will

(A) win, since the company is deemed to be an expert in its field and

has a duty to know all relevant facts about the product that it makes.

(B) win, since it is foreseeable that if the pin did wear out, someone

would be hurt.

(C) win, since a manufacturer is strictly liable for defects in its

product, whether or not it could have prevented those defects.

(D) lose.

159. A carpenter was working on the framework of his roof when he found
that he had brought the wrong hammer onto the roof with him. Without
looking to see if anyone was around, he tossed the hammer to the
ground, shouting, “Heads up!”

A man who was crossing the property was killed when the hammer hit
him in the head.

The representative of the man's estate instituted an appropriate action
against the carpenter, in a jurisdiction that applies the all-or-nothing
rule of contributory negligence, alleging that the carpenter's throwing
of the hammer without looking was negligence. If it were the only one
true, which of the following additional facts or inferences would be

981

most effective in the carpenter's defense against that allegation?

(A) It was reasonable for the carpenter to believe that no one would be

struck by the hammer.

(B) It is customary in the construction industry for people working on a
roof to toss unwanted tools and objects to the ground without
looking, so long as they shout, “Heads up!”

(C) The man could have avoided being struck by the hammer if he had

seen it coming.

(D) The blow of his hammer would not have caused a serious injury to
a normal person, but it seriously injured the man because his head
was extraordinarily sensitive.

160. A man bought a sealed pie from a grocery store. The pie was made by
a local manufacturer. After opening and eating half of the pie, the man
discovered that it was full of worms. A reasonable inspection by the
grocery store would have discovered the worms.

If the man asserts a claim for negligence against the grocery store, the
court should find for

(A) the man, because any negligence by the manufacturer of a product is

imputed to a retailer selling that product.

(B) the man, because the product was defective when the man

purchased it from the grocery store.

(C) the man, because the grocery store failed to act reasonably in

selling the product to the man.

(D) the grocery store, because a retailer is under no duty of reasonable

care when selling products packaged in sealed containers.

161. A mother negligently allowed her nine-year-old son to ride his bike on
a busy road. While doing so, the boy negligently swerved side-to-side
until he was hit by a car driven by a driver. The driver was acting
unreasonably when he struck the boy. The jurisdiction applies the all-
or-nothing rule of contributory negligence.

If the boy asserts a negligence claim against the driver for his injuries,
the court should find for

(A) the boy, because a nine-year-old is presumed incapable of

982

contributory negligence.

(B) the boy, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.

(C) the driver, because the accident resulted from the boy's

unreasonable conduct.

(D) the driver, because it was unreasonable for the boy's mother to give

her son permission to ride his bicycle along the roadway.

162. While attempting to make an arrest at a grocery store, police officers

knocked over several stacks of merchandise, including cases of bottled
soda-pop. This caused minute cracks in all the bottles. The following
day, store employees cleaned up the mess, restacking the cases of
soda-pop without checking any of the bottles for damage. A woman
purchased one of the bottles but did not notice the minute crack in it.

That evening, the woman was placing the bottle on the dinner table
when the bottle exploded because of the crack in it, sending fragments
of glass flying in all directions. The woman was injured.

In an action by the woman against the grocery store, a court is most
likely to find for

(A) the woman, because she could not have done anything to protect

herself against the kind of injury that occurred.

(B) the woman, because the grocery store's conduct in restacking and

selling the bottles without some sort of inspection was
unreasonable under the circumstances.

(C) the grocery store, because the conduct of the police officers was a

proximate cause of the injury sustained by the woman.

(D) the grocery store, because the woman and the grocery store were

not in privity.

163. While standing in an art gallery, a buyer overheard a conversation
between a collector and an art dealer. The dealer stated that a
particular painting was worth $250,000. After the collector left the
gallery, the buyer purchased the painting for $225,000 from the dealer.
The buyer subsequently learned that the painting was worth only $600.

If the buyer is successful in a tort action for misrepresentation against
the dealer, the court is likely to award him a judgment for

983

(A) $250,000 (the value that the dealer stated).

(B) $250,000 (the value that the dealer stated), on condition that the

buyer return the painting to the dealer.

(C) $225,000 (the price that the buyer paid to the dealer).

(D) $224,400 (the price that the buyer paid to the dealer, less the value

of the painting).

164. A man lent his friend his car. The man knew his friend had had his

license revoked for reckless driving, but his friend promised he was
only driving his mother to a doctor's appointment and would return the
car as quickly as possible. In fact, the friend drove the car several
hundred miles away to visit his girlfriend. On the way back, the friend
was speeding and swerving between cars when he crashed into a
woman's car. Because the man's friend had no money, the woman sued
the man for negligence. May she recover?

(A) Yes, because the man loaned his friend the car.

(B) Yes, because the man owned the car.

(C) No, because the friend lied to the man about how he would use the

car.

(D) No, because the woman is only suing the man because his friend

has no money.

165. The plaintiff purchased a bottle of dishwashing detergent made by the

defendant at a supermarket. After using the product for washing dishes,
the plaintiff experienced a serious rash on his hands and wrists as the
result of an allergic reaction to a chemical in the product.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant on the ground that
the product was not merchantable, which of the following additional
facts or inferences, if it were the only one true, would provide the
defendant with its most effective defense?

(A) The plaintiff's allergic reaction was the only such reaction that ever

occurred.

(B) The supermarket purchased the product from an independent

wholesaler that purchased it from the defendant.

(C) Before marketing the product, the defendant made a reasonable

effort to determine whether the product would be harmful to normal

984

skin.

(D) Prior to manufacturing and marketing the product, the defendant
received approval for its sale from the federal Food and Drug
Administration.

166. A statute required all high-rise construction sites to be surrounded by a
temporary fence. The purpose of the statute was to protect people from
being hurt by falling construction debris. A construction company
failed to fence in one of its sites near an elementary school. One of the
schoolchildren wandered onto the site and was poisoned when he
drank water from a puddle on the site. The child's injury was severe.
The child sued the construction company, and the court found the child
would not have been able to get onto the site if the proper fence had
been in place. It also found that a reasonable child of the child's age,
intelligence, and experience would not have drunk the water from the
puddle. The child's attorney then asked the judge to instruct the jury
that the violation of the statute was negligence per se. Should the court
do so?

(A) Yes, because the child would not have been hurt but for the

violation of the statute.

(B) Yes, because the puddle was under the construction company's

control.

(C) No, because the child was poisoned.

(D) No, because the child failed to adhere to the proper standard of

care.

167. The plaintiff and the defendant were at an extremely loud rock concert.
During an argument about gun control, the defendant called the plaintiff
a “dope smoking moron” who only supported gun rights because he
was a “habitual thief.” The plaintiff had never done drugs or stolen
from anyone. A fellow concertgoer overheard the remark and
understood it, although it was so loud that the defendant had no reason
to believe anyone else at the concert could hear him arguing with the
plaintiff. The plaintiff sued the defendant for defamation. During trial,
the court found that the defendant was not negligent in his making of the
statement. The court should find the defendant

(A) liable for libel.

(B) liable for slander.

985

(C) liable for defamation.

(D) not liable.

168. The plaintiff was injured in a car accident and received $100,000
worth of damages. The jury further found that the plaintiff's damage
was caused 20 percent by the plaintiff's negligence, 40 percent by one
defendant's negligence, and 40 percent by another defendant's
negligence. The jurisdiction had a statute that read as follows:

In  a  negligence  action,  no  plaintiff  shall  be  barred  from  recovery
because  of  that  plaintiff's  contributory  negligence,  but  such  plaintiff's
recovery shall be diminished in proportion to plaintiff's own fault.

The court held that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for
the plaintiff's damage and entered judgment for the plaintiff consistent
with the jury's verdict.

Prior to the entry of judgment, the plaintiff collected $10,000 from an
insurance company under a policy in which it agreed to pay any
medical bills that the plaintiff might incur as the result of an
automobile accident. Which of the following correctly reflects the sum
that the plaintiff is entitled to collect from the defendants?

(A) $90,000, because the plaintiff's damage of $100,000 should be
diminished by the sum the plaintiff received from the insurance
company.

(B) $80,000, because the plaintiff's damage of $100,000 should be

diminished by a sum proportional to the plaintiff's own fault,
without regard to sums that the plaintiff has received under the
insurance policy.

(C) $70,000, because the plaintiff's damage of $100,000 should be

diminished by a sum proportional to the plaintiff's own fault and
further diminished by the sum that the plaintiff received under the
insurance policy.

(D) $60,000, because the plaintiff's damage of $100,000 should be

diminished by a sum proportional to the plaintiff's own fault, and
the two defendants' proportional shares should each be further
diminished by the sum that the plaintiff received under the
insurance policy.

169. Although a man realized that his neighbor was drunk, the man asked the

986

neighbor for a ride home. The neighbor agreed and left with the man at
once. Because he was drunk, the neighbor lost control of his car.

The man asserts a negligence claim for his injuries against his
neighbor in a jurisdiction that applies the all-or-nothing rule of
contributory negligence. Which of the following arguments would be
likely to provide the neighbor with an effective defense to that claim?

(A) The man was contributorily negligent in accepting a ride from his

neighbor when he knew his neighbor was drunk.

(B) The man assumed the risk by accepting a ride from his neighbor

when he knew his neighbor was drunk.

(C) It did not matter that the man knew his neighbor was drunk.

(D) The man was contributorily negligent and assumed the risk by
accepting the ride when he knew his neighbor was drunk.

170. A monthly publication of interest primarily to persons who deal in the

purchase and sale of historic buildings as an investment stated that a
property had been purchased by the plaintiff for $1,450,000. It
described the plaintiff as a bank president earning a salary of
$200,000 per year and stated that she had purchased the property with
part of the $1 million fortune that she inherited from her mother.

The plaintiff asserted a claim for invasion of privacy on the ground
that the publication appropriated her identity by publishing the article
about her without her permission. Which of the following would be the
publication's most effective argument in defense?

(A) Information about the purchaser of the property was of interest to

readers of the publication.

(B) The article about the plaintiff did not enrich the publication because

the plaintiff was not a celebrity.

(C) The sale of the property to the plaintiff was a matter of public

record.

(D) Publication of the article was not the result of actual malice.

171. For many years, powdered cement used by a factory was delivered in
90-pound sacks. Recently, however, factory officials determined that it
would be considerably less expensive to purchase unbagged cement.

987

A landowner lived in the area. After the factory began using unbagged
cement, cement dust from the factory's operation continually settled on
the cabin that the landowner occupied. Although the dust did no
physical harm to the cabin or to the landowner, the landowner
complained to officials of the factory that the dust annoyed her.
Because the factory received no other complaints from area residents,
however, it continued using unbagged cement.

The landowner asserts a negligence claim against the factory. Which
of the following would be the factory's most effective argument in
defense?

(A) Changing from bagged cement to unbagged cement resulted in

substantial financial savings to the factory.

(B) The factory's conduct was not a factual cause of the landowner's

discomfort because no other residents complained about the dust.

(C) The landowner assumed the risk by continuing to live in the area.

(D) The landowner sustained no damage as a result of the factory's

conduct.

172. In a negligence action by the plaintiff, the court found that the

defendants were jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in the sum
of $100,000. The court also found that in producing the plaintiff's
injury, the first defendant was 40 percent at fault and the second
defendant was 60 percent at fault. The jurisdiction has a statute
recognizing the right of contribution between joint tortfeasors, and that
contribution shall be based on apportionment of fault.

After the entry of judgment, the plaintiff succeeded in collecting
$100,000 from the first defendant. In an action for contribution by the
first defendant against the second defendant, which of the following
correctly states the amount that he is entitled to collect from the second
defendant?

(A) 0.

(B) $40,000 (40 percent of $100,000).

(C) $50,000 (50 percent of $100,000).

(D) $60,000 (60 percent of $100,000).

173. An employee was driving a pickup truck owned by the company when

988

he collided with an automobile owned and operated by a driver. The
plaintiff, a passenger in the car, sued. At trial, the jury fixed the amount
of the plaintiff's damages and found that the employee was 40 percent
at fault, the driver was 60 percent at fault, and the plaintiff was not at
fault. It was also found that the employee was acting within the scope
of his duties as an employee of the company when the accident
occurred. In issuing a judgment for the passenger, the court held that
the employee and the driver were jointly and severally liable for the
passenger's injuries and that the company was vicariously liable for
the employee's tort. The jurisdiction had statutes that adopted pure
comparative negligence and recognized a right of contribution between
joint tortfeasors.

In enforcing the judgment, the plaintiff succeeded in collecting
$100,000 from the company. If the company asserts a claim against the
employee seeking compensation for the company's payment to the
plaintiff, the company is entitled to recover

(A) nothing, because the company was found to be vicariously liable

for the employee's tort.

(B) $40,000 as partial indemnity.

(C) $50,000 as contribution.

(D) $100,000 as complete indemnity.

174. A biker was riding her bicycle in a reasonable manner when she was

struck by a car negligently driven by a driver. As a result, the biker
was thrown to the ground, breaking her left leg. A moment later, while
lying in the road, the biker was struck by a car negligently driven by a
second driver, breaking the biker's right leg.

If the biker asserts a claim against the second driver, the second driver
will be held liable for damages resulting from

(A) the biker's broken right leg.

(B) the biker's broken right and left legs.

(C) the biker's broken right and left legs, but only if the first driver's

conduct was foreseeable.

(D) neither leg.

175. As a result of a minor earthquake, the framework of a building that the

989

builder was erecting collapsed. When the builder began the building,
he knew that the steel that he was using for that purpose was of poor
quality but decided to use it anyway. If the steel had not been of poor
quality, the earthquake would not have caused the building to collapse.

A driver was employed by a gas company to operate a gasoline truck.
She had parked the truck in front of the builder's construction site
moments before the earthquake. When the building collapsed, falling
debris struck the truck, causing it to rupture and causing its cargo of
gasoline to leak. A stream of gasoline that leaked from the truck
flowed for three blocks until it reached another nearby street. There,
unaware of the presence of gasoline, a man tossed a lit cigarette into
the street. The cigarette caused the gasoline to explode, injuring a
woman standing nearby.

If the woman asserts a claim against the gas company driver, alleging
that it was negligent for the driver to park a gasoline truck in front of a
construction site, which of the following would be the driver's most
effective argument in defense against the woman's claim?

(A) The builder's use of poor-quality steel was a superseding cause of

the woman's injury.

(B) The explosion would not have occurred if the man did not throw a

lit cigarette into the street.

(C) The driver could not have anticipated that falling debris from the
construction site would cause the truck to rupture and leak.

(D) The explosion that injured the woman was proximately caused by

the earthquake.

176. The owner of a supermarket purchased an automatic door-opener from

its manufacturer. The device included rubber step-plates that were to
be installed on the floor on both sides of the door.

The store owner hired a contractor to install the automatic door-
opener while the store was closed for the night. The contractor read
the instructions furnished by the manufacturer but disregarded a
warning regarding testing the step-plates. When he finished installing
the device, he did not test it by stepping on one of the step-plates, but
advised the store's night manager that the job was complete. The
following morning, a customer was injured by the door.

990

The customer asserted a claim against the manufacturer on the ground
that the step-plate was defective when sold by the manufacturer.
Which of the following would be the manufacturer's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) It was not foreseeable that a person installing the automatic door-
opener would disregard the warning contained in the instructions.

(B) The manufacturer did not act unreasonably in designing or

manufacturing the automatic door opener or in furnishing the
instructions that came with them.

(C) The customer was not a purchaser of the automatic door-opener.

(D) The store owner was negligent in selecting the contractor to install

the automatic door-opener.

177. The plaintiff owned a local coffee shop. The defendant wrote a

newspaper story that the plaintiff had been accused by a customer of
drugging her coffee and locking her in a dungeon in the basement. The
customer really made the accusation, but the accusation was false and
the customer was well-known throughout town for making false
accusations against shop owners she didn't like. The plaintiff sued the
defendant for defamation. At trial, it was established the plaintiff was
not a public figure, and the plaintiff presented evidence that the
defendant knew or should have known of the customer's habit of
making false accusations. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the defendant, because the plaintiff did not establish that the

defendant believed the accusations were false.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff did not establish that the

defendant recklessly disregarded whether the accusations were
true.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff did not establish that the

defendant intended to cause harm to the plaintiff's reputation.

(D) the plaintiff.

178. A homeowner hired a painter to paint the outside of the homeowner's

house.

Two days later, a government employee was walking across the
homeowner's lawn while delivering mail. The homeowner saw the
employee walking toward the painter's ladder on his lawn but did not

991

warn the employee because he believed that she saw it. Although the
lawn had recently been mowed and the ladder was in plain view, the
employee did not see the ladder and tripped over it, injuring her knee.

The jurisdiction applies the all-or-nothing rule of contributory
negligence.

If the government employee asserts a negligence claim against the
painter for damages resulting from her injury, which of the following
would be the painter's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The ladder was in plain view.

(B) The employee was trespassing at the time the accident occurred.

(C) The painter owed no duty to licensees of the homeowner.

(D) The homeowner was negligent in not warning the employee about

the ladder.

179. The plaintiff was involved in an accident after he was hit by a drunk

driver. The amount of alcohol that one defendant sold the driver would
have made her intoxicated even if a second defendant sold the driver
no alcohol at all, and the amount of alcohol that the second defendant
sold the driver would have made the driver intoxicated even if the first
defendant sold the driver no alcohol at all. Which of the following
statements is most correct?

(A) The first defendant did not cause the plaintiff's injury because the
second defendant subsequently sold the driver enough alcohol to
make her intoxicated.

(B) The second defendant did not cause the plaintiff's injury because

the first defendant had previously sold the driver enough alcohol to
make her intoxicated.

(C) Neither defendant caused the injury.

(D) Both defendants caused the injury.

180. A landowner hired a professional architect to draw plans for a two-

story residence to be constructed on the landowner's realty. The plans
that the architect prepared called for a staircase to be supported by a
single concrete pillar. The landowner then hired a licensed building
contractor to construct a house in accordance with the architect's
design. Upon examining the plans, the contractor told the landowner

992

that she did not think that one pillar would provide sufficient support
for the staircase. When the landowner discussed the contractor's
objection with the architect, however, the architect insisted that one
pillar would be sufficient. The landowner told this to the contractor
and convinced the contractor to rely on the architect's plan.

The contractor completed the building as agreed and turned it over to
the landowner on April 1. Two weeks later, the landowner hired a
mover to move a piano onto the second floor of the house. While the
mover was carrying the piano up the staircase, the staircase collapsed,
causing the mover to sustain injury. If the staircase had been supported
by two columns, it would not have collapsed.

If the mover asserts a negligence claim against the architect, which of
the following would be the architect's most effective argument in
defense?

(A) It was reasonable to support the staircase with only one pillar.

(B) The architect owed the mover no duty since the architect was

employed by the landowner.

(C) The contractor had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.

(D) The use of a single pillar to support the staircase was a matter
exclusively within the architect's professional judgment as an
architect.

181. A man was obviously intoxicated when he entered a bartender's tavern
one night and ordered a drink. A statute made it unlawful to serve
liquor to any intoxicated person. Even so, the bartender served the
man. After drinking the liquor, the man left the tavern and began
driving home.

Before the liquor left the manufacturer's factory, an angry employee
added a poison to it that could not have been discovered by
reasonable inspection. While the man was driving in a reasonable
manner, the poison caused him to die. As a result, the man's car struck
a pedestrian, injuring her.

If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the bartender based on the
bartender's violation of the above statute, which of the following
would be the bartender's most effective argument in defense against

993

that claim?

(A) The bartender did not serve the man enough liquor to make him

intoxicated.

(B) The statute was not meant to prevent people from drinking liquor

that had been poisoned.

(C) Serving the liquor to the man was not a cause of the pedestrian's

injuries.

(D) The angry employee's conduct was a superseding cause of the

pedestrian's injuries.

182. An airline went out of business and sold a belt truck to a second
airline. An independent contractor hired by the second airline to
maintain the second airline's equipment set the truck's belt idle above
25. Due to a mistake at the factory, the belt truck was not equipped
with an acceleration suppressor. An acceleration suppressor would
keep the truck from lurching no matter where the idle was set.
Subsequently, an employee of the second airline attempted to activate
the belt while standing beside the belt truck. Because the idle was set
above 25, she was injured when the belt truck lurched forward and
struck her.

The employee asserted a negligence claim against the independent
contractor. Which one of the following additional facts or inferences,
if it were the only one true, would be most likely to result in a
judgment for the independent contractor in a jurisdiction that applies
the all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence?

(A) Belt trucks are usually equipped with acceleration suppressors.

(B) If the employee had been in the driver's seat when she started the

belt truck, she would not have been injured.

(C) The omission of an acceleration suppressor was a manufacturing

defect in the belt truck.

(D) The first airline failed to notify the second airline about the need

for an acceleration suppressor.

183. A company operated a manufacturing plant just outside the town.

Breezes frequently carried fumes from the company's plant into the
town.

994

A homeowner's son developed a respiratory illness as the result of an
unusual reaction to the fumes. The homeowner complained to the
company about his son's illness. When the company responded by
offering to buy the homeowner's house, the homeowner refused.

The homeowner asserted a public nuisance claim on behalf of his son
in which he sought an order directing the company to eliminate the
fumes. Which of the following would be the company's most effective
argument in response to this claim?

(A) The claim is not for special damages.

(B) The son's illness was the result of an unusually sensitive reaction to

the fumes.

(C) The homeowner assumed the risk by refusing to sell the property to

the company.

(D) The fumes did not violate state pollution laws.

184. The manufacturer made a product that was sold over the counter for the
treatment of dandruff and dry scalp conditions. A doctor purchased a
bottle at a drugstore. A statement on the label read, “This product will
not harm normal scalp or hair.” The doctor used the product as
directed. Because of a scalp condition making him allergic to one of
the ingredients, the product irritated his scalp, causing him much pain
and discomfort.

In an action by the doctor against the drugstore, which of the following
would be the doctor's most effective argument?

(A) Any negligence by the manufacturer is imputed to the drugstore.

(B) The product was defective as labeled.

(C) The drugstore breached an express warranty.

(D) A drugstore is under a special duty to be aware of possible allergic

reactions to products that it sells.

185. After the plaintiff sued the defendants for injuries caused in an auto

accident, the jury found that the accident was 60 percent the fault of the
first defendant and 40 percent the fault of the second defendant. The
court ruled that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for the
plaintiff's injuries, which amounted to $100,000.

995

The jurisdiction had a statute that provided that “In any negligence
action, a plaintiff's recovery shall not be barred by that plaintiff's fault,
but the recovery of said plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to
such plaintiff's fault unless that plaintiff's fault shall be greater than
that of the defendant, and in such event the plaintiff's recovery shall be
barred.” Which of the following correctly states the sum that the
plaintiff is entitled to receive from the second defendant?

(A) $60,000 (60 percent of $100,000).

(B) $40,000 (40 percent of $100,000).

(C) $100,000.

(D) 0.

186. A daily newspaper printed an article about a minister's speech. The

article referred to the minister's speech as “inspiring, considering the
fact the minister suffers from leprosy.” After seeing the article, the
minister sued the newspaper for defamation.

The newspaper moved to dismiss the minister's action on the grounds
that his complaint contained no allegation of damage. Which of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one true,
would be most helpful to the minister in opposing the motion to
dismiss?

(A) Leprosy is a loathsome disease.

(B) The minister was so upset upon 

reading the newspaper's statement about him that he became
physically ill.

(C) Editors of the newspaper disliked the minister.

187. A man was eating one of the company's pre-packaged desserts when he

found a cockroach in it.

In an action by the man against the company, which of the following
additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one true, would
provide the company with its most effective defense?

cockroach in the product.

(C) The company complied with all statutory requirements for quality

control in the production of the product.

(D) The man purchased the product on the recommendation of a sales

clerk at the grocery store.

188. A pilot was flying his airplane when one of its engines stopped

working. Although the pilot thought he could probably make it back to
the airport, he decided it would be safer to make an emergency landing
in a farmer's field. The plane ended up causing $500 worth of damage
to the farmer's crops, although the pilot's actual landing of the plane
was done in accordance with federal aviation rules and was not
negligent. The farmer sued the pilot to recover his $500. The court
should rule in favor of

(A) the pilot, because the broken engine created a private necessity.

(B) the pilot, because the pilot was not negligent.

(C) the farmer, because the pilot damaged his crops.

(D) the farmer, because the pilot probably could have made it back to

the airport.

189. Two political candidates were known for insulting and playing pranks
on each other. During a nationally televised debate, the defendant lit a
firecracker as a joke and tossed it onto the plaintiff's podium right as
the plaintiff was making a speech regarding his toughness and bravery
in foreign policy. When the firecracker went off, the plaintiff covered
his head and fell onto the floor. Although the plaintiff sustained no
physical injury, the audience laughed and he was embarrassed by the
incident.

The plaintiff filed a claim against the defendant for intentional
infliction of emotional distress. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the defendant, because the plaintiff was only embarrassed.

(B) the defendant, because he was only joking.

(C) the plaintiff, because he fell onto the floor.

(D) the plaintiff, because throwing a firecracker at someone is

outrageous.

997

190. A store owner hired a contractor to install an automatic door-opener
while the store was closed for the night. The contractor read the
instructions furnished by the manufacturer but disregarded a warning
related to its installation. The following morning, a customer was
injured by the door when it short-circuited. In a claim by the customer
against the contractor, which of the following would be the customer's
most effective argument?

(A) The contractor's liability is established by res ipsa loquitur.

(B) It was unreasonable for the contractor to disregard the warning
contained in the instructions furnished by the manufacturer.

(C) The automatic door-opener was installed in a way that made it unfit

for ordinary use.

(D) The short circuit made the automatic door-opener defective.

191. A driver was driving her automobile in the rain when she rounded a
bend and saw a cow standing directly in her path. She immediately
jammed on her brakes and pulled the steering wheel to the right in an
attempt to avoid striking the cow. As a result, she lost control of her
car, which skidded off the road and into the homeowner's yard.

In an action by the homeowner against the driver for negligence, which
of the following arguments would be most effective as a defense for
the driver?

(A) Her conduct did not result in damage.

(B) She was not required to act reasonably because she was confronted

by an emergency.

(C) She was privileged by the doctrine of necessity.

(D) It was foreseeable that users of the road would deviate onto

adjacent private land in connection with their use of the road.

192. A doctor owned a large machine for putting patients to sleep during
surgery. The doctor sent the machine to the manufacturer for repairs.
While making the repairs, the manufacturer accidentally filled the
anesthetic gas can with plain oxygen and the plain oxygen can with
anesthetic. During a surgery, the doctor wanted to administer pure
oxygen to the patient. However, because of the mistake in the cans, the
patient got pure anesthetic instead. As a result, the patient died.

998

The patient's family sued the doctor for damages resulting from the
death of the patient. During trial, the court found the doctor acted
unreasonably in her treatment of the patient. The court should find the
doctor is

(A) liable, because the doctor was unreasonable in her treatment of the

patient.

(B) liable, because of res ipsa loquitur.

(C) not liable, because the death was caused by the manufacturer's

negligence.

(D) not liable, because the negligence occurred while the machine was

in the care of the manufacturer.

TORTS QUESTIONS

1.  B  If  the  risk  of  injury  to  the  doctor  was  not  foreseeable,  then  the
manufacturer could not be said to have acted unreasonably in the face
of a foreseeable risk. Since negligence is usually defined as failure to
act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable risk, this would mean that
the manufacturer was not negligent.

Conduct  is  a  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm  would  not  have  occurred
without  it.  Thus,  if  the  label  contained  a  warning  that  the  doctor
disregarded  or  failed  to  read,  his  conduct  could  be  contributory  or
comparative negligence that helped cause his injury. Since the label
did  not  contain  any  warning,  however,  his  injury  would  have
occurred whether he read it or not. For this reason, his failure to read
it was not causally related to the harm that he suffered and does not
provide the manufacturer with a defense. If the doctor sued for breach
of  warranty,  he  might  be  required  to  show  that  he  relied  on  some
statement  contained  on  the  label,  and  his  failure  to  read  it  might
prevent  him  from  establishing  such  reliance.  Since  his  lawsuit  is
based  on  negligence,  however,  A  is  incorrect.  Even  if  the  product
was manufactured by another, the manufacturer would be under a duty
to  use  reasonable  care  in  marketing  it,  so  that  fact  alone  would  not
protect the manufacturer against liability to the doctor. C is therefore
incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  manufacturer's  lack  of
awareness might have been negligent if the reasonable person in the
manufacturer's shoes would have been aware.

2. A Negligence is unreasonable conduct in the face of a foreseeable risk.
The  defendant's  awareness  of  the  high  incidence  of  crime  in  the
neighborhood  would  make  the  risk  foreseeable  and  might  result  in  a
finding  that  it  was  unreasonable  for  her  to  open  the  door  under  the
circumstances. While it is not certain that a court would come to this
conclusion, the fact in A is the only one listed that would help support
the plaintiff's case.

The  plaintiff's  knowledge  would  not  impose  any  duty  on  the
defendant, so B is incorrect. Although the defendant's intention to sell
furniture  to  the  plaintiff  might  make  the  plaintiff  an  invitee,  and
thereby impose upon the defendant a duty to act reasonably, the duty
would not be breached unless the defendant had some reason to know

1001

that there was a danger in opening the door. C is therefore incorrect.
D  is  incorrect  because  unless  the  defendant  knew  or  should  have
known  of  the  incident,  it  would  have  no  relevance  to  the
reasonableness of the defendant's conduct.

3. D A misrepresentation is a false assertion of material fact made with the
intent  to  induce  the  plaintiff's  reliance.  If  the  defendant  knew  that  the
statement  was  false,  and  if  the  plaintiff  justifiably  relied  upon  it,  the
defendant is liable for damage that results. If a party to a transaction is
under  a  legal  obligation  to  disclose  a  fact,  nondisclosure  may  be  an
assertion that the fact does not exist. Thus, since the developer had an
obligation to disclose that the highway was coming, her silence was an
assertion  that  there  was  no  highway  coming.  Since  she  knew  this
assertion to be false, she is liable for misrepresentation if the farmer's
reliance on it was justified. Consequently, D is correct.

Since  real  estate  investors  are  usually  experts  in  determining  the
value of real estate, the fact that the farmer knew the developer to be
a  real  estate  investor  might  have  justified  his  reliance  on  her
misrepresentation.  A  is  incorrect  because  this  would  be  likely  to
result  in  a  victory  for  the  farmer  rather  than  the  developer.  If  the
developer's  nondisclosure  was  a  misrepresentation,  she  probably
repeated  the  misrepresentation  by  permitting  an  appraiser  to
determine  value  without  disclosing  the  coming  of  the  highway.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  A  fiduciary  relationship  is  one  based  on  trust.
Since  buyer  and  seller  are  adversaries,  neither  is  the  other's
fiduciary. C is therefore incorrect.

4. D Negligence is the failure to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable
risk. If selling a pistol for less than $50 created a foreseeable risk to
the woman, it might be found that the gun maker's conduct in doing so
was  unreasonable  and  that  the  gun  maker  is  liable  to  the  woman  for
negligence.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this
conclusion, the argument in D is the only one listed that could possibly
support the woman's claim.

Intent is an essential element of battery. In a battery case, intent means
that  the  defendant  desired  (or  knew  with  substantial  certainty)  that
harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  the  plaintiff  would  occur.  A  is
incorrect  because  the  fact  that  harm  is  foreseeable  (rather  than
substantially certain) is not sufficient to result in liability for battery.
In  every  sale  by  a  merchant,  there  is  an  implied  warranty  that  the

1002

product  sold  is  merchantable,  or  fit  for  ordinary  use.  There  is  no
indication,  however,  that  the  pistol  did  not  function  as  a  pistol
ordinarily functions. B is therefore incorrect. It is sometimes said that
violation of a criminal statute establishes negligence if the statute was
designed to protect a class of persons to which the plaintiff belongs
against  risks  like  the  one  that  led  to  the  harm.  C  is  incorrect,
however, because there is no indication that the gun maker violated a
criminal statute.

5. C One whose conduct creates a foreseeable risk to any person owes that
person a duty of reasonable care. One who helps an intoxicated person
get his or her car started is creating a foreseeable risk to all who are
likely  to  be  endangered  by  that  person's  driving.  If  the  injury  to  the
pedestrian occurred 200 miles away from the place where the dentist
assisted  the  man,  however,  it  may  successfully  be  argued  that  the
reasonable  person  in  the  man's  situation  would  not  have  anticipated
harm to him because the man could be expected to sober up in the time
it took to drive that distance. While it is not certain that a court would
come to this conclusion, the argument in C is the only one listed that
could possibly support the dentist's defense.

Although a statute like the one mentioned in A might impose liability
on  the  bartender,  it  would  not  have  the  effect  of  relieving  any  other
person of liability, so A is incorrect. B is incorrect because being in
the road service business does not exempt any person from his or her
common law duty to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable risk.
D  would  establish  that  the  man's  intoxication  was  a  cause  of  the
accident but would not establish that the dentist's actions were not. If
anything,  it  would  prove  the  cause-and-effect  relationship  between
the dentist's conduct and the accident. D is therefore incorrect.

6. C  Negligence  liability  requires  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care
that  is  a  proximate  cause  of  the  plaintiff's  damage.  To  say  that  the
plaintiff was outside the foreseeable zone of danger is simply another
way  of  saying  that  because  of  where  the  plaintiff  was  located,  the
injury  to  him  or  her  was  not  foreseeable.  This  argument  could  help
support the driver's defense in two ways. First, if harm to the painter
was not foreseeable, the driver did not owe him a duty of reasonable
care.  This  would  mean  that,  although  the  driver's  conduct  might  have
been negligent as to the hunter, it could not have been negligent as to
the  painter.  Second,  unless  some  injury  to  the  painter  was  a

1003

foreseeable  result  of  the  driver's  conduct,  that  conduct  was  not  a
proximate cause of it. Although a court might not agree that the painter
was  outside  the  foreseeable  zone  of  danger,  the  argument  in  C  is  the
only one listed that could possibly support the driver's defense.

It  is  generally  understood  that  if  an  injury  to  the  plaintiff  was
foreseeable, all its complications are foreseeable too, no matter how
improbable those complications actually were. For this reason, A and
D  are  incorrect.  Joint  tortfeasors  are  two  or  more  persons  whose
torts  proximately  caused  the  same  injury.  In  most  jurisdictions,  they
are  jointly  and  severally  liable  for  the  full  extent  of  the  plaintiff's
injury.  The  argument  in  B  would  establish  that  the  hunter  was
negligent, but this would not provide the driver with a defense since
he and the hunter might be found to be joint tortfeasors.

7. A All persons are liable for the harm that proximately results from their
negligence. Thus, if the burglar's injury was proximately caused by the
brewery's negligence, the brewery is liable to her.

An express warranty is an assertion of fact that becomes part of the
basis of the bargain. B is incorrect because there is no indication that
an  express  warranty  was  made.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  clean
hands  doctrine,  which  is  relevant  in  equity  proceedings,  is  not
applicable  to  an  action  for  money  damages.  Since  it  is  foreseeable
that  the  burglar  could  obtain  the  beer  in  some  manner,  the  precise
manner  in  which  the  burglar  obtained  the  beer  is  immaterial.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

8. C  False  imprisonment  occurs  when  the  defendant  intentionally  confines
the plaintiff. The plaintiff is confined when his or her will to leave a
place with fixed boundaries is overcome in a way that would similarly
overcome the will of the reasonable person in the plaintiff's situation.
Since  the  fisherman  was  not  prevented  from  leaving,  he  was  not
confined (i.e., imprisoned).

In  a  false  imprisonment  case,  the  term  intent  means  a  desire  or
knowledge that the defendant's act will result in a confinement of the
plaintiff and does not depend on whether the defendant knew that the
plaintiff's  rights  were  being  violated.  Thus,  if  the  acts  of  the  movie
studio's employees had resulted in a confinement of the fisherman, the
fact that they did not know they were violating the fisherman's rights
would  not  provide  them  with  an  effective  defense.  A  is  therefore

1004

incorrect. B is incorrect because false imprisonment is an intentional
tort of which unreasonable conduct is not an essential element. D is
incorrect because damage is not an essential element of liability for
false imprisonment.

9.  C  Although  liability  ordinarily  results  from  the  publication  of  false
defamatory  statements  about  the  plaintiff,  the  courts  have  always
required  that  publication  be  either  intentional  or  the  result  of
negligence.  The  competitor's  statement  to  the  handyman  was  not  a
publication  since  the  handyman  is  the  plaintiff.  The  fact  that  it  was
overheard  by  the  customer  does  not  satisfy  the  requirement  of
publication unless either the competitor intended that the customer hear
it or the customer heard it as a result of the competitor's unreasonable
conduct in the face of the foreseeable risk that the customer would hear
it. If the competitor knew that the customer would hear it, he intended
the publication. If he should have known that the customer would hear
it, he acted unreasonably in saying it.

When the plaintiff is not a public figure, courts do not require proof
that  the  defendant  knew  the  statement  to  be  defamatory,  so  A  is
incorrect.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  in  some
defamation cases, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant knew or
should have known that the statement was false when he made it. B is
incorrect, however, because the requirement has not been applied to a
defamation  action  brought  by  a  private  person  against  a  non-media
defendant. D is incorrect because knowledge that harm will result is
not an essential element of any defamation case.

10.  C  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective  condition  when  sold  and  that  reaches  the  consumer  in  a
condition  that  is  substantially  unchanged.  Although  the  farmer  could
still be held liable, C would be her most effective argument.

A  is  incorrect  because  intervening  negligence,  unless  it  was
unforeseeable, is not sufficient to relieve the supplier of a defective
product from liability. Although privity or some substitute is relevant
to warranty liability, strict liability in tort may be applied to benefit
any  plaintiff  whose  contact  with  the  product  was  foreseeable.  B  is
therefore incorrect. Since strict liability is not based on fault, proof
that  the  defect  resulted  from  some  circumstance  beyond  the
defendant's  control  is  not  sufficient  to  free  that  defendant  from
liability. D is therefore incorrect.

1005

11. C Assault results when the defendant, with the intention of causing either
offensive  contact  or  apprehension  of  offensive  contact,  induces
apprehension of such contact in the plaintiff. Battery results when the
defendant,  with  the  intention  of  causing  either  offensive  contact  or
apprehension  of  offensive  contact,  causes  offensive  contact  with  the
plaintiff. The defendant, intending to cause apprehension of offensive
contact,  induced  such  apprehension,  making  him  liable  for  assault.
With intent to induce apprehension, he also caused offensive contact,
making  him  liable  for  battery.  Therefore,  A,  B,  and  D  are  all
incorrect.

12. D A negligent misrepresentation is a false assertion of fact that is made
without  knowledge  of  its  falsity  but  under  circumstances  such  that  a
reasonable  person  in  the  defendant's  situation  would  have  had  such
knowledge. Thus, if the seller's belief that there were no termites in
the  house  was  reasonable,  his  misrepresentation  was  not  negligent.
Although  there  are  not  enough  facts  to  determine  whether  a  court
would  come  to  this  conclusion,  D  is  the  only  argument  listed  that
could possibly support the seller's position.

A is incorrect because lack of such knowledge would be negligent if
the reasonable person would have known. Whether or not the seller
had  a  duty  to  disclose  the  presence  of  termites,  when  he  discussed
termites,  he  had  a  duty  to  do  so  honestly  and  reasonably.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  A  statement  is  of  opinion  if  it  concerns  a
subjective  matter  or  contains  an  expression  of  doubt.  Since  the
seller's  statement  was  neither,  it  was  not  of  opinion.  C  is  therefore
correct.

13.  D  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective  condition  when  sold.  Thus,  if  the  supermarket  sold  the
product  while  it  was  defective,  the  supermarket  would  be  held
strictly liable no matter who manufactured it.

Parties  who  work  together  to  accomplish  a  particular  result  are
involved  in  a  concert  of  action  that  may  make  any  one  of  them
vicariously  liable  for  torts  committed  by  the  others.  A  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  facts  indicate  that  the  manufacturers  and
retailer  did  not  work  together  on  manufacturing  or  marketing  the
product.  It  has  been  held  that  where  there  are  a  small  number  of
manufacturers  in  a  particular  industry,  where  all  belong  to  an
industry-wide  association  that  establishes  industry  standards,  where

1006

those  standards  result  in  their  products'  being  defective,  and  where
all  members  of  the  industry  and  the  association  are  named  as
defendants, liability may be imposed on an industry-wide basis. B is
incorrect, however, because there is no indication that the number of
cereal manufacturers is small or that they belong to an industry-wide
association  that  sets  standards  or  that  their  standards  made  the
product  defective  or  that  all  members  of  the  industry  and  their
association  have  been  named  as  defendants.  Under  the  alternate
liability theory, where two or more defendants commit identical acts
of  negligence  under  circumstances  that  make  it  impossible  to  tell
which  one  injured  the  plaintiff,  it  will  be  presumed  that  all  of  them
factually  caused  the  plaintiff's  injury.  C  is  incorrect,  however,
because  there  is  no  indication  that  all  the  parties  named  committed
identical acts of negligence or that any of them was negligent at all.

14. D Assault occurs when, with the intent to induce such apprehension, the
defendant  induces  in  the  plaintiff  a  reasonable  apprehension  that  a
harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  the  plaintiff  will  occur.  Since  the
girl's mother did not fear contact with herself, she was not assaulted.

A and B are incorrect because the kidnapper's conduct did not induce
the girl's mother to apprehend contact with herself. If the kidnapper's
conduct  did  give  the  girl's  mother  reason  to  apprehend  contact  with
herself, it would not matter whether she had perceived contact with
the girl. C is therefore incorrect.

15. A Strict liability is imposed on the keeper of a wild animal, but only for
harm that proximately results from an aspect of the animal that made
keeping  it  dangerous.  Leopards  are  dangerous  because  they  bite  or
attack. The risk that they may clumsily knock someone over is not one
that makes them more dangerous than a dog or other domestic animal.

B is incorrect because an animal is “wild” if it comes from a species
that  cannot  ordinarily  be  safely  kept  without  special  training  or
restraint. Since this is true with leopards, the leopard's tameness does
not prevent it from being so classified. C and D are incorrect because
strict liability does not depend on the reasonableness of a defendant's
conduct.

16.  B  A  claim  for  damages  resulting  from  contact  with  a  product
manufactured  or  sold  by  the  defendant  may  be  based  on  several
theories, including negligence, misrepresentation, breach of warranty,

1007

and  strict  liability  in  tort.  In  most  jurisdictions,  however,  mental
suffering is not a recoverable item of damage in a claim based on any
of these theories unless the mental suffering is the result of a physical
injury  or  has  a  physical  manifestation.  Although  a  few  jurisdictions
permit recovery even in the absence of physical injuries, the argument
in B is the only one listed that could possibly support the defendant's
defense.

A is incorrect for two reasons: First, even without a representation,
the  defendant  could  be  held  liable  on  negligence,  implied  warranty,
or strict liability theories, and second, the statement that the suit was
“strong  enough  to  be  worn  several  times”  was  probably  a
representation. C  is  incorrect  because  none  of  the  theories  requires
that  the  plaintiff  be  in  privity  with  the  manufacturer.  Although  the
argument  in  D  might  provide  an  effective  defense  to  a  negligence
claim, D is incorrect because the other theories that are available do
not depend on unreasonable conduct by the defendant.

17. A Under the all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence, unreasonable
conduct  by  the  plaintiff  that  contributes  to  the  happening  of  an
accident  is  a  complete  bar  to  recovery  by  the  plaintiff.  Thus,  if  the
boy's conduct was unreasonable, the driver's defense of contributory
negligence will succeed.

B,  C,  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the  negligence  of  a  parent  in
supervising a child is not imputed to the child. The reasonableness of
the mother's conduct is therefore not in issue.

18.  C  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective condition when sold. A product is defective if its condition
would defeat the reasonable expectations of the reasonable consumer.
Since  the  reasonable  consumer  probably  would  not  expect  a  brand
new training leash to break when used on a dog of average size and
strength, one that did was probably defective.

Strict  liability  may  be  applied  to  benefit  any  person  whose  contact
with  the  defective  product  was  foreseeable,  so  A  is  incorrect.  B  is
the
incorrect  because  strict 
reasonableness of the defendant's conduct. D is incorrect because the
risk that it describes as foreseeable is not the one that led to the harm
in this case since the device was brand new when it broke.

liability  does  not  depend  on 

19. A A person is liable for all harm that proximately results from his or her

1008

negligence.  Thus,  if  the  aunt  was  negligent  in  giving  the  doll  to  the
boy, she may be held liable for the injury that resulted. It is possible
that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion  since  it  may  have  been
foreseeable  that  a  child  of  the  boy's  age  would  swallow  the  button
and be injured. Although the result is not certain, the argument in A is
the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  a  judgment  for  the
father.

In  every  sale  by  a  merchant,  there  is  an  implied  warranty  that  the
product sold is fit for ordinary use. If the product is unfit, breach of
warranty  liability  is  imposed  without  regard  to  fault.  Similarly,  if  a
product  is  defective  or  unreasonably  dangerous,  strict  tort  liability
may be imposed on the supplier. B, C, and D are incorrect, however,
because these theories are available only against a defendant who is
a professional supplier of products, which the aunt was not.

20. C  The  key  to  this  question  is  that  the  plaintiff  is  basing  his  claim  on
negligence, not strict products liability. Since negligence is a breach
of  the  duty  to  act  reasonably,  the  grocery  store  could  be  held  liable
under that theory only if it acted unreasonably. Since the tablets were
delivered in a sealed bottle, and since the reasonable merchant does
not ordinarily open sealed products before selling them, the grocery
store  probably  did  not  breach  the  duty  that  it  owed  to  the  plaintiff.
While the grocery store could be held liable if the trier of fact found
that  the  reasonable  merchant  would  ordinarily  open  sealed  products
before selling them, C is the best answer out of the choices given.

A is incorrect because a manufacturer's negligence is not imputed to a
retailer. B is based on an incorrect statement of the law. A retailer's
duty is to use reasonable care. The breach of this duty is negligence.
Although a retailer may be held liable without fault under a theory of
strict liability, this liability is based not on the breach of “an absolute
duty,”  but  on  a  policy  that  attempts  to  distribute  the  risks  of  being
injured  by  defective  products.  D  is  incorrect  because  negligence
liability  depends  on  the  foreseeability  of  the  risk,  not  upon  the
existence of any contractual relationship.

21.  C  A  defendant  owes  a  plaintiff  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  if  the
defendant's conduct creates a foreseeable risk to the plaintiff. Thus, if
it  was  foreseeable  that  a  person  would  be  in  the  roadway,  the  taxi
driver owed that person a duty to drive as a reasonable person. Once
it is established that such a duty existed, its breach by driving while

1009

intoxicated is obvious.

Since  the  pedestrian's  presence  in  the  roadway  was  part  of  the  set
stage (i.e., preexisted the defendant's tortious act), it does not matter
whether the circumstances that put her there were foreseeable. A and
B are therefore incorrect. Although a plaintiff must establish that his
or  her  injury  was  a  foreseeable  result  of  the  defendant's  negligent
conduct, he or she is never required to establish that the defendant's
negligence was foreseeable. D is therefore incorrect.

22. B Strict liability is often imposed on one who uses his or her land in a
non-natural manner for the storage of a substance that is likely to do
harm  upon  its  escape  from  storage.  The  storage  of  water  frequently
leads to the application of this principle.

Although  strict  liability  is  imposed  on  one  who  engages  in  an
abnormally  dangerous  activity,  it  is  imposed  only  for  damage  that
results  from  the  dangerous  nature  of  the  activity.  Although  the
operation of a nuclear power plant may be an abnormally dangerous
activity, A is incorrect because harm in this case did not result from
any  of  the  aspects  of  operating  a  nuclear  power  plant  that  make  it
abnormally  dangerous.  If  the  power  company  knew  or  should  have
known that an earthquake might occur in the area of the nuclear power
plant, it might have been unreasonable to operate it there. But absent
such actual or constructive knowledge, the power company's conduct
cannot be presumed to be unreasonable. C is therefore incorrect. The
intervention of an Act of God does not free an antecedent wrongdoer
from  liability  unless  that  intervention  was  unforeseeable.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

in  abnormally  dangerous  activities  such  as 

23.  D  Strict  liability  may  be  imposed  for  damage  resulting  from
the
participation 
manufacture and storage of explosives. Even under a theory of strict
liability,  however,  a  defendant  is  not  liable  for  harm  unless  it  was
proximately  caused  by  the  defendant's  activity.  Conduct  that  is  a
factual  cause  of  harm  is  a  proximate  cause  of  that  harm  if  the  harm
was a foreseeable result and was not brought about by unforeseeable
intervention. Thus, if the intervening conduct of the terrorists was not
foreseeable, 
the  homeowner  was  not
proximately  caused  by  the  conduct  of  the  company.  While  it  is  not
certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  D  is  the  only
argument listed that could possibly support the company's defense.

the  harm  sustained  by 

1010

A is incorrect because strict liability may be imposed regardless of
fault  and  regardless  of  whether  the  defendant's  conduct  was
reasonable. Most jurisdictions hold that there can be no liability for
trespass to land unless there was a physical invasion of the plaintiff's
realty.  B  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  company  may  be  held
liable  on  a  strict  liability  theory,  which  does  not  require  a  physical
invasion.  Even  though  a  defendant's  conduct  was  a  factual  cause  of
harm,  that  defendant  will  not  be  held  liable  if  there  was  an
unforeseeable intervening cause of the harm. C is incorrect, however,
because  the  intervening  cause  will  not  prevent  such  liability  unless
the intervention was unforeseeable.

24. C Nondisclosure of a fact is not an assertion (i.e., representation) unless
the fact is one that is essential to the transaction and the circumstances
are  such  that  the  other  party  is  reasonably  entitled  to  expect
disclosure of it. Since the buyer had no special expertise, his reason
for  purchasing  the  hay  wagon  was  not  a  fact  essential  to  the
transaction, and there were no circumstances that entitled the seller to
expect disclosure of his hope of making a profit.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  slight  differences  in  knowledge
concerning the subject of a particular transaction are not sufficient to
impose a duty of disclosure. D is incorrect because the seller's initial
satisfaction  would  not  prevent  her  from  recovering  if  it  had  been
induced by a misrepresentation by the buyer.

25. C  A  defendant's  conduct  is  not  a  proximate  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm
was  brought  about  by  an  independent  intervening  cause.  An
intervening cause is “independent” if it did not result from one of the
normal  risks  resulting  from  the  defendant's  conduct.  Since  the  first
pilot's plane was safely on the ground at an airport when struck by the
second  pilot's  plane,  it  can  be  argued  that  the  collision  was
independent  of  the  risks  created  by  the  first  pilot's  miscalculation.
While it is not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the
argument in C is the only one listed that could possibly be effective in
the first pilot's defense.

A  plaintiff  may  be  barred  from  recovery  by  assumption  of  the  risk
when the harm results from a danger of which the plaintiff was aware
and  which  he  or  she  voluntarily  encountered.  Since  there  is  no
indication that the first pilot's miscalculation resulted from his lack of
a  commercial  pilot's  license,  the  harm  did  not  result  from  a  risk  of

1011

which the businessman knew. A is therefore incorrect. Under the all-
or-nothing  rule,  a  plaintiff's  negligence  may  prevent  recovery  if  it
was  causally  related  to  the  harm  which  he  or  she  sustained.  Since
there is no indication that the first pilot's miscalculation resulted from
his  lack  of  a  commercial  pilot's  license,  any  negligence  by  the
businessman in accepting a ride from him was not causally related to
the accident. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of
harm if the harm would not have occurred without it. The argument in
D states that the harm would not have occurred if the second pilot had
not  been  negligent.  This  is  obviously  true  and  establishes  that  the
second  pilot's  negligence  was  a  factual  cause  of  the  accident.  The
argument also states, however, that the first pilot's miscalculation was
therefore not a factual cause of the accident. Since the accident would
not have occurred if the first pilot's plane had not been on the ground,
and  since  the  first  pilot's  plane  would  not  have  been  on  the  ground
had  the  first  pilot  not  miscalculated,  the  first  pilot's  miscalculation
was also a factual cause of the accident. D is therefore incorrect.

26.  A  The  patient's  injury  would  not  have  occurred  without  the
manufacturer's  negligence,  so  the  manufacturer's  negligence  was  a
cause of it. Since the patient's injury would not have occurred without
the  doctor's  error,  and  since  the  doctor's  error  came  between  the
manufacturer's conduct and the patient's injury, the doctor's error was
an  intervening  cause  of  the  patient's  injury.  If  negligence  that  is  a
cause of harm is followed by an intervening cause of harm that was
not  foreseeable,  the  intervention  is  regarded  as  a  superseding  cause
that  relieves  the  antecedent  wrongdoer  of  liability.  Thus,  if  the
doctor's  error  was  unforeseeable,  the  manufacturer  would  not  be
liable to the patient.

If  the  doctor's  conduct  was  foreseeable,  it  would  constitute  a
concurring  cause  of  harm  and,  as  such,  would  not  shield  the
antecedent  wrongdoer  from  liability.  This  is  true  whether  that
intervention  was  reasonable  or  not,  and  whether  it  is  classified  as
gross negligence or not. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

27.  B  Almost  all  theories  of  products  liability  require  that  the  plaintiff's
contact  with  the  product  be  foreseeable.  Since  hypodermic  needles
are  commonly  used  by  doctors  to  give  injections  to  patients,  the
patient's contact with the needle is foreseeable.

It  is  less  foreseeable,  if  it  is  foreseeable  at  all,  that  a  child  would

1012

play  with  a  hypodermic  needle,  so  A  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect
because none of the products liability theories permit the recovery of
losses that are unrelated to personal injury or property damage. D is
incorrect because there is no indication that the needle was infected
when sold by the manufacturer or that the infection resulted from the
manufacturer's negligent conduct.

28. B Trespass to land is defined as intentional entry on the plaintiff's realty
without authorization. Since realty includes the airspace immediately
above the land, the crop duster entered the gardener's realty when she
flew through the air 15 feet above his land. Although she believed that
she  had  authority  to  do  so,  she  did  not  have  such  authority.  Her
overflight  was,  thus,  a  trespass  if  her  entry  onto  the  realty  was
intentional.  A  defendant  has  the  necessary  intent  to  be  liable  for
trespass to land if he or she desires or knows that his or her act will
result  in  an  entry  onto  the  realty  that  he  or  she  entered.  This  is  so
regardless  of  whether  he  or  she  knows  whose  realty  he  or  she  is
entering,  or  that  the  entry  is  unauthorized.  Since  the  crop  duster  did
desire to fly over parcel 621, she had the necessary intent and will be
liable for trespass to the land of the gardener.

Without  intent,  there  is  no  trespass  liability.  A  is  incorrect  because
participation in an abnormally dangerous activity does not satisfy the
requirement of intent. C is incorrect because intent means a desire to
enter the land or airspace above it (without regard to knowledge of
the plaintiff's right). D is incorrect because damage to the realty is not
an essential element of trespass to land.

29. D  The  tort  known  as  invasion  of  privacy  can  be  committed  in  various
ways. One, called “intrusion,” is committed by intentionally invading
the  plaintiff's  right  to  solitude  in  a  manner  that  would  offend  the
reasonable person. An invasion of the plaintiff's solitude occurs when
the defendant causes a physical entry into the plaintiff's private space.
Since  the  reporter  deliberately  entered  the  senator's  private  office,
opened  the  senator's  private  file,  and  copied  the  senator's  private
documents,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  reporter  intentionally  invaded
the senator's solitude. Although it can never be certain that a court or
jury will decide that the reasonable person would have been offended
by  any  particular  conduct,  D  is  the  only  answer  listed  that  could
possibly be correct.

A and B  are  incorrect  because  freedom  of  the  press  under  the  First

1013

Amendment  does  not  privilege  invasions  of  privacy  for  the  purpose
of obtaining documents, even if they are newsworthy. C is incorrect
for two reasons: First, the documents were not made public until after
the  reporter  invaded  the  senator's  privacy  by  obtaining  them,  and
second,  the  privilege  to  publish  facts  that  are  matters  of  public
records  does  not  include  a  privilege  to  invade  privacy  for  the
purpose of obtaining them.

30.  D  The  facts  specify  that  the  plaintiff's  claim  is  for  negligence.
Negligence is unreasonable conduct. It may be unreasonable to sell a
device as dangerous as an air rifle to an 11-year-old because the risk
that he or she will use it to shoot another child is foreseeable. In any
event, D is the only finding listed that could result in a judgment for
the plaintiff.

A is incorrect because negligence of a manufacturer is not imputed to
a retailer. B and C  are  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  there  is  no
indication  that  the  air  rifle  was  defective,  and  second,  negligence
liability requires unreasonable conduct, and there is no indication that
the  defendant  acted  unreasonably.  Thus,  even  if  the  air  rifle  was
defective, there would be no reason to impose negligence liability on
the defendant.

31. D Since the car dealer knew that the mechanic's repairs were frequently
not  successful  until  the  third  or  fourth  attempt,  it  was  probably
unreasonable  for  the  car  dealer  to  trust  him  with  the  repair  of  a
condition that the car dealer knew made the car unsafe to drive. While
it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  the
argument  in  D  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  a
judgment for the plaintiff.

the  doctrine  of  respondeat  superior,  an  employer 

is
Under 
vicariously  liable  for  torts  of  an  employee  committed  within  the
scope  of  employment.  In  determining  whether  one  who  renders
services to the defendant is an employee, courts generally hold that if
the  employer  has  a  right  to  control  the  details  of  performance,  the
worker is an employee, while if the employer does not have a right to
control  the  details  of  performance,  the  worker  is  an  independent
contractor.  Since  the  car  dealer  did  not  control  the  details  of  the
the  mechanic  probably  was  not  an
mechanic's  performance, 
employee.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Statutory  duties  are  sometimes
held to be “non-delegable,” but B  is  incorrect  because  no  statute  is

1014

given. Since employers of independent contractors are not ordinarily
held  vicariously  liable  for  the  torts  of  those  contractors,  C  is
incorrect.

32. D Like other suppliers of products, a retailer owes its customers a duty
to act reasonably. This includes a duty to make whatever inspection is
reasonable.  Sometimes  the  circumstances  make  it  reasonable  for  a
retailer to make no inspection at all, but in such a case, no inspection
constitutes a reasonable inspection.

A,  B,  and  C  are  incorrect  because  under  some  circumstances  the
conduct  specified  would  not  be  reasonable.  (Note:  Beware  of
statements  that  are  overly  broad  or  general.  For  example,  some
writers and judges have stated that “a retailer owes the customer no
duty  to  inspect  products  furnished  by  reputable  manufacturers.”  Do
you think that this statement would be true if the retailer knew that a
shipment  of  glassware  furnished  by  a  reputable  manufacturer  was
dropped by the delivery company, or that many customers had found
dead  rats  in  the  jars  of  peanut  butter  that  were  furnished  by  a
reputable  manufacturer?  It  is  safer  to  recognize  that  a  retailer,  like
any  other  supplier  of  products,  owes  customers  a  duty  to  act
reasonably,  and  that  under  some  circumstances,  failure  to  inspect
merchandise  furnished  by  reputable  manufacturers  is  reasonable,
while under other circumstances, it is not.)

33.  B  There  can  be  no  liability  for  defamation  unless  the  defendant
intentionally or negligently communicated the defamatory statement to
a person other than the plaintiff. Communication of the accusation to
the  employee's  mother  would  satisfy  this  requirement  only  if  the
employer  knew  or  should  have  known  that  she  would  see  the  letter
that contained them.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  statements
actually were communicated to the employee's mother, who read the
letter.  Courts  have  sometimes  held  that  an  employer  who  defames  a
former employee in a communication with a prospective employer of
that  former  employee  is  privileged  if  he  or  she  believes  reasonably
and  in  good  faith  that  his  or  her  statements  are  true.  This  reasoning
does  not  apply  to  the  facts  given,  however,  because  the  employer's
statements  were  not  being  made  to  a  prospective  employer  of  the
employee. D is therefore incorrect.

1015

34. A Strict liability is imposed on the professional seller of a product that
is in defective condition when sold. Neither the pilot's partner nor the
mechanic sold the helicopter, so B, C, and D are incorrect.

35. B A trespassing child is entitled to reasonable care if it was foreseeable
that a child would trespass and be injured, and if the child's age made
it  likely  that  he  or  she  would  fail  to  recognize  the  danger.  Thus,
although  the  boy  was  a  trespasser,  the  fact  that  the  gravel  pit  owner
could  foresee  his  presence  and  foresee  that  he  would  be  injured  by
the  proximity  of  the  hill  to  the  road  imposed  upon  the  gravel  pit
owner the duty to act reasonably and to keep the premises reasonably
safe.  If  the  gravel  pit  owner's  failure  to  erect  a  fence  was
unreasonable,  the  gravel  pit  owner  was  negligent  and  probably  is
liable to the boy.

The phrase “danger invites rescue” is usually used to explain why a
person  who  created  a  danger  to  another  owed  a  duty  of  reasonable
care  to  a  rescuer  who  came  to  the  aid  of  that  other.  A  is  incorrect
because it has no application to these facts. “Last clear chance” is a
doctrine  that  accomplishes  only  one  thing:  Under  the  proper
circumstances,  it  negates  the  effect  of  a  plaintiff's  contributory
negligence.  Only  the  plaintiff  raises  it,  and  only  for  the  purpose  of
negating  the  effect  of  his  or  her  own  negligence.  C  is  incorrect
because it would put the argument at the disposal of a defendant. An
intervening  cause  does  not  free  an  antecedent  wrongdoer  from
liability unless its occurrence was unforeseeable. Thus, the mere fact
that the car driver's conduct was an intervening cause would not lead
to a judgment for the gravel pit owner. D is therefore incorrect.

36. B A misrepresentation is a false assertion of material fact made for the
purpose  of  inducing  the  plaintiff's  reliance.  If  the  defendant  knows
that  the  assertion  is  false,  and  damages  result  from  the  plaintiff's
justified  reliance  on  it,  the  defendant  may  be  held  liable.  It  may  be
argued  successfully  that  by  concealing  the  crack,  the  seller  falsely
asserted  that  it  did  not  exist.  No  liability  will  result  from  that
assertion, however, unless the buyer relied on it. A plaintiff relies on
a  misrepresentation  when  it  is  a  significant  factor  in  the  plaintiff's
decision.  Since  the  buyer  discovered  the  crack,  the  assertion  that  it
did not exist could not have been a factor in his decision to buy the
car. For that reason, he did not rely on it and is not entitled to recover
damages.

1016

A  is  incorrect  because  a  court  would  probably  hold  that  the
affirmative act of concealing the crack was an assertion that it did not
exist.  Since  the  buyer  did  not  rely  on  the  seller's  representation,  it
does not matter whether such reliance would have been justified. C is
therefore  incorrect.  Since  the  facts  indicate  that  the  buyer  was
required  to  spend  $500  on  repairs,  D  is  an  inaccurate  statement  of
fact and is therefore incorrect.

37. B Under the all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence, a plaintiff is
completely  barred  from  recovering  damages  if  his  or  her  own
unreasonable conduct contributed to the occurrence. Since the second
driver  saw  the  first  driver  in  the  intersection,  it  was  probably
unreasonable, and therefore contributorily negligent, for him to enter
the intersection when he did.

The doctrine of last clear chance does no more than negate the effect
of  a  plaintiff's  contributory  negligence.  If  a  defendant  had  “the  last
clear  chance”  to  avoid  injuring  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant  might  be
held  liable  in  spite  of  the  plaintiff's  negligence.  The  plaintiff  never
loses  a  case,  however,  simply  because  that  plaintiff  had  “the  last
clear chance” to avoid being injured. A is therefore incorrect. C and
D  are  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  presumption  that  results
from  a  defendant's  violation  of  a  statute  (sometimes  called
negligence  per  se)  may  ordinarily  be  rebutted  by  proof  that  the
violation resulted from circumstances beyond the defendant's control,
and  second,  even  if  the  first  driver  could  not  rebut  the  presumption
that he was negligent, the second driver's contributory negligence is
still available to him as a defense.

38.  A  Although  the  phrase  “AS  IS”  disclaims  implied  warranties  of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, it does not free a
seller  from  the  duty  of  acting  reasonably.  Since  it  probably  was
foreseeable that the purchaser of a refrigerator would plug it in even
after being advised that it did not work, the store owner had a duty to
take reasonable precautions against the harm that might result. If her
failure to warn the customer was unreasonable, it was negligence that
was a proximate cause of harm and would result in liability.

B is incorrect because the phrase “AS IS” is an effective disclaimer
of the implied warranty of merchantability (i.e.,  fitness  for  ordinary
use). C  is  incorrect  because  the  store  owner  is  still  liable  under  a
negligence theory. D is based on a misinterpretation of the doctrine of

1017

last clear chance, which accomplishes nothing more than undoing the
effect of a plaintiff's contributory negligence. (If a defendant had “the
last clear chance” to avoid injuring the plaintiff, the defendant might
be  liable  in  spite  of  the  plaintiff's  negligence.  The  plaintiff  never
loses  a  case,  however,  simply  because  that  plaintiff  had  “the  last
clear chance” to avoid being injured.)

39. B Self-defense is a privilege to use reasonable force to defend oneself
against a threatened contact. Reasonable force is that force that would
appear necessary to the reasonable person. Courts generally hold that
it  is  reasonable  to  use  deadly  force  in  defense  against  what
reasonably appears to be a threat of deadly force.

A is incorrect because it is never reasonable to use deadly force for
the  sole  purpose  of  preventing  a  trespass  to  land  or  chattel.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  defendant's  initial  use  of  gentle  force  was
privileged in defense of property, making the plaintiff's response to it
a  threatened  battery.  The  plaintiff's  trespass  did  not  end  when  he
completed  his  entry  but  continued  so  long  as  he  refused  to  leave  in
response to the defendant's demand. D is therefore incorrect.

40.  A  One  who  keeps  a  wild  animal  is  strictly  liable  for  harm  that
proximately results from keeping it. An animal is “wild” if it comes
from  a  species  that  cannot  ordinarily  be  kept  safely  without  special
training or restraint. For this purpose, the wildcat was a wild animal
even though it had been tamed.

The  terms  foreseeable  and  unforeseeable  are  mutually  exclusive.
Thus if the cat's behavior was unforeseeable, it could not have been
foreseeable.  B  is  incorrect  for  this  reason,  and  because  the
foreseeability of harm is not in itself sufficient to result in liability. C
is  incorrect  for  several  reasons:  First,  res  ipsa  does  not  apply  in
strict  liability  cases;  second,  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  the
injury  would  not  ordinarily  have  occurred  without  negligence;  and
third, res ipsa  does  not  apply  when  there  is  direct  evidence  of  the
defendant's  conduct.  D  is  incorrect  because  private  nuisance  is  an
interference with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy realty, and there
was no interference with the plaintiff's right to use or enjoy realty.

41.  D  If  a  product  fails  to  live  up  to  an  express  assertion  of  fact  that  a
supplier made about it, the supplier may be liable without regard to
fault on theories of breach of express warranty and misrepresentation.

1018

For  this  purpose,  an  assertion  of  fact  may  be  made  by  the  use  of
models  or  pictures.  The  photo  on  the  box  probably  was  an  express
assertion that the helmet was suitable for use as a motorcycle helmet.
Since  it  was  not  suitable  for  such  use,  the  company  is  liable  for
breach of express warranty and misrepresentation. In addition, strict
products  liability  may  be  imposed  for  damage  that  results  from  a
defect  in  a  product  supplied  by  a  defendant.  For  this  purpose,  a
product  is  defective  if  its  condition  would  defeat  the  reasonable
expectations of the reasonable consumer. Since the photo on the box
showed the helmet being used as a motorcycle helmet, the reasonable
person probably would have expected it to be suitable for such use.
Since it was not, the company is strictly liable for damage.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  misrepresentation  and  strict  products
liability  theories  discussed  above  do  not  require  privity  between
defendant  and  plaintiff,  and  because  under  the  express  warranty
theory,  it  has  been  held  that  the  necessary  privity  exists  between
anyone who made the express assertion and anyone who relied on it.
B is incorrect because even if the product was not intended for use as
a motorcycle helmet, the photo on the box probably was an assertion
that  it  was  suitable  for  such  use.  C  is  incorrect  for  three  reasons:
First, the jurisdiction's “pure comparative negligence” system would
diminish the plaintiff's recovery in proportion to his own fault, but it
would not completely bar that recovery; second, since the purpose of
a  motorcycle  helmet  is  to  protect  the  user  in  an  accident,  the
defendant's  assertion  and  the  reasonable  person's  expectation  might
have been that the helmet would be effective even if the accident was
the  wearer's  own  fault;  and  third,  most  jurisdictions  hold  that
comparative negligence is not a defense to actions that are not based
on fault (i.e., breach of warranty, misrepresentation, or strict products
liability).

42. A The statute given is typical of the “owner-consent” statute that exists
in a number of jurisdictions. It requires the owner to pay for the tort
committed  by  the  driver.  Whenever  the  law  imposes  vicarious
liability on one for damage that another has caused, the one who pays
is entitled to complete indemnity from the one who should have paid.

B  would  be  correct  if  the  accident  resulted  from  some  fault  by  the
owner in addition to that of the mechanic, but it is incorrect because
there  is  no  indication  that  the  owner  acted  unreasonably.  C  is

1019

incorrect  because  there  is  no  factual  basis  for  determining  that  the
owner  is  himself  responsible  for  any  portion  of  the  loss.  D  is
incorrect because of the owner's right of indemnity.

43. A  Commercial  suppliers,  such  as  the  wholesaler,  are  strictly  liable  if
they sell a defective product that injures a foreseeable plaintiff, such
as  a  purchaser.  Here,  the  seeds  were  defective  since  they  were
poisonous, and the breeder was a foreseeable plaintiff.

Since  the  dealer  sold  the  seeds  in  the  same  package  in  which  they
came, the dealer's failure to inspect them was foreseeable whether or
not  it  was  reasonable.  B  is  incorrect  because  a  foreseeable
intervention,  even  if  unreasonable,  does  not  free  an  antecedent
wrongdoer  from  liability.  Although  liability  for  breach  of  warranty
may  require  privity,  the  theories  of  negligence  and  strict  liability  in
tort  do  not.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  strict
liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a  defective
condition when sold, without regard to the possibility that some other
seller of the same product might be liable. Thus, a manufacturer and
retailer of a defective product may be jointly and severally liable as
joint tortfeasors.

44. A  Since  the  coming  of  a  rescuer  is  generally  viewed  as  a  foreseeable
result  of  peril,  negligence  that  causes  peril  is  often  held  to  be  a
breach of a duty owed to a rescuer. Thus, if the swimmer's negligence
caused the need for the rescuer to rescue him, it was a breach of duty
owed to the rescuer.

B is incorrect because if the swimmer had not acted negligently, there
would be no basis for holding him liable to the rescuer. The phrase
“danger  invites  rescue”  is  often  used  to  explain  why  one  who
imperils another owes a duty of reasonable care to a rescuer attracted
by  that  peril.  If  that  principle  had  any  application  to  these  facts,  it
would  be  to  establish  liability,  not  to  free  the  swimmer  from  such
liability.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  An  intervening  cause  does  not
prevent  an  antecedent  wrongdoer  from  being  liable  unless  the
intervention was unforeseeable. D is therefore incorrect.

45. B  There  is  some  question  about  whether  it  is  defamatory  to  say  that  a
person is impoverished or on the verge of bankruptcy. But even if the
defendant's  statement  was  defamatory,  it  was  oral  and,  therefore,
classified  as  slander.  Ordinarily,  there  is  no  liability  for  slander

1020

unless the plaintiff establishes actual damage to his or her reputation.
Since the company did not believe what the defendant told him, there
was no damage to the plaintiff's reputation, and the defendant will not
be held liable for saying it.

A is incorrect because mental suffering is not an essential element of
defamation.  Since  liability  for  defamation  is  imposed  on  the
publisher  of  a  defamatory  statement,  the  fact  that  the  defendant  was
only repeating what he heard would not in itself protect him against
liability.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  Since  publication  is  defined  as
communication to any person other than the plaintiff, D is incorrect.

46. C Since negligence is defined as a failure to act reasonably in the face
of a foreseeable risk, the defendant cannot be called negligent if the
reasonable  person  in  the  defendants'  situation  would  not  have  acted
any differently than the defendant did.

Assumption of the risk requires that the plaintiff have knowledge of
the  risk  that  he  or  she  is  voluntarily  encountering.  Since  there  is  no
indication  that  the  plaintiff  knew  of  the  risks  associated  with
exposure  to  the  material,  A  is  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the
defendant's  lack  of  knowledge  would  not  prevent  liability  if  the
reasonable  person  in  the  defendant's  situation  would  have  known.
Workers'  compensation  may  be  the  exclusive  remedy  against  an
injured party's employer, but since the plaintiff did not work for the
defendant, D is incorrect.

47. B A claim for private nuisance can be asserted only by a plaintiff who
claims that the defendant's conduct interfered with his or her use and
enjoyment  of  realty  in  which  he  or  she  has  a  present  or  future
possessory interest. Since the gardener held a leasehold interest and
the  landlord  a  reversion,  they  can  successfully  assert  a  private
nuisance claim.

A is incorrect because as a tenant, the gardener had sufficient interest
in the realty. C and D are incorrect because, since the employee was
only  an  employee  of  the  gardener,  he  lacked  the  property  interest
necessary to the assertion of the claim.

48.  A  Trespass  to  chattel  is  intentional  interference  with  the  plaintiff's
chattel  resulting  in  damage.  For  this  purpose,  intent  consists  of  a
desire or knowledge that the chattel will be involved, without regard
to whether the defendant knows that the chattel is the plaintiff's or that

1021

the plaintiff's rights are being violated. Interference can consist of any
act regarding the chattel that only its rightful possessor is entitled to
perform. Since the defendant desired to take that particular coat, she
had the necessary intent, regardless of her belief that the coat was her
own.  Since  only  the  plaintiff  was  entitled  to  take  the  coat,  the
defendant  interfered  with  it.  Since  the  coat  was  destroyed  while  the
defendant  possessed  it,  her  interference  resulted  in  damage  to  the
plaintiff. The defendant is therefore liable to the plaintiff for trespass
to chattel.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  tort  was  committed  when  the  defendant
took the coat and the tort led to the coat's destruction. In trespass to
chattel, intent does not require knowledge that the chattel belongs to
another, or that the defendant's act will affect the rights of another. C
is  therefore  incorrect.  Trespass  to  chattel  was  committed  when  the
defendant  took  the  coat.  If  she  had  succeeded  in  returning  the  coat,
damages might have been mitigated (i.e., reduced), but the tort would
not  have  been  undone.  D  is  incorrect  because  her  unsuccessful
attempt to return the coat could not even mitigate damages.

49. C Liability is imposed on a defendant for damage that was proximately
caused  by  the  defendant's  negligence.  Since  it  is  given  that  the
hospital was negligent in keeping the trucker waiting six hours, it is
necessary  to  determine  whether  that  negligence  was  a  proximate
cause of his injury in the earthquake. Conduct is a proximate cause of
harm  if  it  was  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  that  harm.  Conduct  is  a
factual cause of harm if the harm would not have occurred without it.
Since the trucker would not have been struck by the debris that fell in
the earthquake if he had not been present, the delay occasioned by the
hospital's negligence was a factual cause of his injury. If conduct is a
factual cause of harm, it is a legal cause if the harm was foreseeable.
Thus,  if  it  was  foreseeable  that  the  trucker  would  be  injured  by  an
earthquake, the hospital's negligence was a legal cause of that injury
and the hospital is liable for it. Otherwise, the hospital is not liable.
Here,  the  fact  that  an  earthquake  had  never  occurred  before  likely
made the earthquake unforeseeable.

“Good  Samaritan”  statutes,  where  they  exist,  only  protect  doctors
who  voluntarily  render  emergency  aid  at  the  scenes  of  accidents.  A
is,  therefore,  incorrect.  Although  the  liability  of  an  antecedent
wrongdoer  might  depend  on  whether  subsequent  intervention  was

1022

foreseeable,  since  the  doctor's  conduct  preceded  the  hospital's,  the
hospital's  liability  does  not  depend  on  whether  the  doctor's  conduct
was  foreseeable.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  too  absolute  a
statement to be correct. Even if a hospital owes its patients some duty
with respect to natural disasters, that duty is only to act reasonably in
the face of them.

50. D If the seller of a product knows the buyer's purpose in buying it, and
he knows also that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill in selecting
a product to suit that purpose, the sale is accompanied by an implied
warranty  that  the  product  is  fit  for  the  buyer's  particular  purpose
(UCC  §2-315),  even  where  that  purpose  is  identical  to  the  ordinary
use of such a product. Similarly, even where the implied warranty of
fitness  for  the  buyer's  particular  purpose  is  present,  the  implied
warranty  of  merchantability  accompanies  every  sale  by  a  merchant
(UCC §2-314) unless it is effectively disclaimed.

51. D The defendant is not liable for harm unless its conduct was a factual
and legal cause of it. Its conduct was a factual cause of harm only if
the  harm  would  not  have  occurred  without  it.  If  the  force  of  the
collision would have caused a good pole to fall, then the fact that the
pole was rotten is not a factual cause of its falling.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  they  do  not  establish  that  the
defendant's conduct was a factual cause of harm, and liability cannot
be  imposed  unless  it  was.  If  the  defendant's  conduct  was  a  factual
cause of harm, the driver's intervention might be a superseding cause
that protects the defendant from liability, but only if the intervention
was  unforeseeable.  This  does  not  necessarily  depend  on  whether  it
was criminal or grossly negligent. C is therefore incorrect.

52.  A  The  statute  given  is  typical  of  the  “pure  comparative  negligence”
approach. Since the car driver's loss amounted to $10,000, and since
it  was  40  percent  his  own  fault,  40  percent  of  $10,000  (or  $4,000)
must be deducted from his recovery. The balance that he is entitled to
collect is $6,000. Therefore, B, C, and D are incorrect.

53.  A  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective condition when sold. Since the bolt was cracked when the
sled left the sled factory, the sled company would be held liable if the
crack constituted a defect.

B and C are incorrect because the use or sale by the boy would not

1023

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

prevent  the  imposition  of  strict  liability  if  the  sled  was  defective
when  it  left  the  sled  factory,  so  long  as  such  use  or  sale  did  not
substantially  change  its  condition.  D  is  incorrect  because  strict
liability  in  tort  does  not  depend  on  unreasonable  conduct  by  the
defendant.

54. A Negligence is the failure to act as a reasonable person would act in
the  face  of  risks  that  are  foreseeable  or  known  to  exist.  Since  a
reasonable person would not ordinarily subject others to unnecessary
risks, it would probably have been unreasonable (i.e., negligent) for
the attorney to subject the client to the danger of a defective elevator
if  the  attorney  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the  danger.  Here,
leading the client to the elevator minutes after it plunged downward
was likely unreasonable.

However,  if  the  attorney  did  not  act  unreasonably,  he  would  not  be
negligent even though he occupied the entire second floor. Thus, B is
incorrect.  Ordinarily,  obligations  in  a  lease  flow  only  between
parties  to  that  lease.  Some  jurisdictions  hold  that  a  landlord's  lease
obligation  to  keep  premises  in  good  repair  may  impose  on  the
landlord  a  duty  to  invitees  of  tenants.  C  is  incorrect,  however,
because the attorney continues to be liable for the proximate results
of his own negligence even though the landlord might also be liable.
While  a  tenant  might  not  have  an  obligation  to  repair  the  leased
premises, D is incorrect because the attorney might be liable for his
negligence in allowing the client to use the elevator.

55. C One who enters the realty of another to retrieve a chattel that got there
through no fault of his or her own has a qualified privilege to do so,
but he or she must compensate the landholder for any actual damage
that results.

A  and  D  are  therefore  incorrect.  Unless  damage  to  the  realty  of
another  results  from  participation  in  an  abnormally  dangerous
activity, liability for it is imposed only if the entry resulted from fault
(i.e., was intentional or negligent). Since transporting gravel is not an
abnormally  dangerous  activity,  and  since  the  gravel  was  spilled
without any fault on the part of the trucker, the trucker is not liable for
damage resulting from spilling the gravel. B is therefore incorrect.

56. D One who voluntarily encounters a known risk assumes that risk and is

not entitled to damages resulting from it.

1024

A, B, and C are all incorrect since assumption of risk is available as
a defense in claims based on negligence or strict liability. In addition,
B is incorrect because horses are not regarded as wild animals, and
C is incorrect because the fact that the trainer had been warned of the
animal's  propensity  indicates  that  the  horseman's  conduct  was
reasonable.

57.  A  The  phrase  “AS  IS”  disclaims 

the 

implied  warranty  of
merchantability.  In  addition,  it  may  be  argued  that  it  modifies  any
express  warranties  or  representations  that  resulted  from  the  car
dealer's  assurance  that  he  believed  the  car  to  be  in  good  condition,
and that it would have placed the reasonable consumer on notice that
the  car  might  not  be  in  good  condition.  In  any  event,  A  contains  the
only combination of conclusion and reason that are reasonably related
to each other.

B is incorrect because all jurisdictions permit an action for breach of
the implied warranty of merchantability to be brought by any member
of  the  purchaser's  household.  C  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the
phrase “AS IS” disclaimed the implied warranty that the car was fit
for ordinary use.

58. A In an action for conversion, the defendant is liable for the full value of
the  chattel  at  the  time  of  conversion.  Consequently,  the  plaintiff  can
recover  the  value  of  the  car  at  the  time  she  delivered  it  to  the
defendant. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

59.  D  Negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct.  If  the  company  did  not  act
unreasonably, it could not have been negligent. Although a court might
not come to this conclusion, the argument in D is the only one listed
that could possibly support the company's defense.

A  is  incorrect  because  contributory  negligence  is  unreasonable
conduct  by  a  plaintiff.  In  this  case,  the  plaintiff  is  the  girl,  not  the
cleaner. B and C are incorrect because an intervening cause of harm
does not cut off a wrongdoer's liability unless that intervening cause
was unforeseeable.

60. B A landholder is entitled to use reasonable force to prevent a trespass.
Serious or deadly force is not regarded as reasonable, however, since
human life is much more valuable than mere property. The use of such
force is therefore a battery.

1025

Negligence  is  the  breach  of  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  owed  by  the
defendant  to  the  plaintiff.  Ordinarily,  a  defendant  owes  a  plaintiff  a
duty  of  reasonable  care  if  the  defendant's  conduct  creates  a
foreseeable risk to the plaintiff. Thus, if the risk to persons entering
on legitimate business was foreseeable, the warehouse owner owed a
duty of reasonable care to such persons. This does not mean that he
owed  such  a  duty  to  everyone,  however,  or  that  he  owed  it  to  the
burglar. A is incorrect for this reason and because of a rule applied
by  most  jurisdictions  that  a  landholder  owes  no  duty  of  reasonable
care to trespassers. C  is  incorrect  because  no  rule  of  law  prohibits
the  use  of  mechanical  devices  unless  they  inflict  excessive  force.
Although courts have made statements like that in D, it is irrelevant
here  since  the  device  did  not  injure  an  innocent  bystander.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

61. A  An  intentional  exercise  of  dominion  and  control  over  a  chattel  by  a
defendant  is  a  conversion  if  the  plaintiff  was  lawfully  entitled  to
possession of the chattel, and if he or she was thereby damaged. In a
conversion  case,  “intent”  means  a  desire  (or  knowledge  with
certainty)  that  the  defendant's  act  will  affect  the  particular  chattel
involved.  In  this  case,  the  neighbor's  desire  to  make  the  television
hers and to carry it off satisfies the intent requirement, even though it
was reasonable for her to believe that the sale was legitimate.

B and C are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect since the plaintiff need
not be in possession of the chattel at the time of conversion, so long
as he or she had a right to possess it.

62. B  A  guest  rides  free.  If  something  of  value  —  like  rides  on  alternate
days  —  is  given  in  return  for  passage,  courts  will  conclude  that  the
passenger  was  not  a  guest  for  purposes  of  the  automobile  guest
statute.

In  a  negligence  claim,  the  existence  of  insurance  coverage  is  not
relevant  in  determining  liability.  A  is  incorrect  for  this  reason  and
because  the  “guest”  statute  was  originally  created  to  protect
insurance  companies  against  collusive  claims.  Recklessness  or
aggravated negligence is usually held to be actionable in the face of a
statute that prohibits actions for negligence. C is incorrect, however,
because  the  facts  do  not  indicate  the  conscious  disregard  of  an
obvious  and  serious  risk  that  aggravated  negligence  requires.  D  is
probably  an  accurate  statement.  It  is  incorrect,  however,  because  it

1026

does not justify non-enforcement of the statute.

63. B A defendant manufacturer can be relieved of strict products liability if
an  intermediate  handler  of  the  product  substantially  changes  the
product before sending it on through the stream of commerce.

Strict  liability  may  be  imposed  regardless  of  whether  the  defendant
was negligent. Since the basis of the volunteer firefighter's action is a
claim that the product was defective (i.e., strict liability in tort), the
fact  that  the  company  acted  reasonably  would  not  furnish  it  with  an
effective  defense.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  plaintiff  assumes  the
risk when he or she knows of it and voluntarily encounters it. Since
the  volunteer  firefighter  had  never  heard  of  the  device  before,  he
could  not  have  known  of  the  risk  or  assumed  it.  C  is  therefore
incorrect. An intervening cause of harm is one that came between the
defendant's  conduct  and  the  plaintiff.  It  is  “independent”  if  it  is  not
related to the risk created by the defendant. D is incorrect because a
plaintiff's  own  conduct  is  not  usually  regarded  as  an  intervening
cause of harm.

64. B Since it is given that the injury to the baker's nose resulted from the

eye doctor's negligence, the eye doctor is liable for it.

It  is,  of  course,  possible  for  harm  to  have  more  than  one  proximate
cause. Thus, even if the neighbor's conduct was a proximate cause of
the injury, the eye doctor's conduct may also be a cause of it, making
the eye doctor liable as a joint tortfeasor. (In most jurisdictions, joint
tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable.) A is therefore incorrect.
Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm  would  not  have
occurred  without  it.  Since  the  injuries  to  the  baker's  elbow  and
shoulder would have occurred even without the negligence of the eye
doctor, his conduct was not a factual cause of those injuries, and the
eye doctor could not be held liable for them. C and D are therefore
incorrect.

65.  A  One  who  holds  himself  or  herself  out  to  be  an  attorney,  even  if
unlicensed,  is  required  to  act  like  a  reasonable  attorney.  If  the
attorney did not, he will be held liable for damages that proximately
resulted.

Negligence does not lead to liability unless it is a cause of damage.
Thus,  although  violation  of  a  statute  sometimes  results  in  a
presumption of negligence, it does not result in liability unless it was

1027

a cause of the plaintiff's damage. Negligence is not a cause of damage
that  would  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  licensed  attorneys
sometimes  lose  cases,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  attorney  would  not
have lost the case if he had had a license. B and C are incorrect for
this  reason  and  because  courts  usually  hold  that  violation  of  a
licensing statute does not result in a presumption of negligence. D is
incorrect because even though an attorney does not guarantee results,
he or she is liable for damages that result from his or her negligence.

66. C Consent means willingness, and the affirmative defense of consent is
effective  because  of  the  rule  that  a  plaintiff  who  is  willing  for  a
particular thing to happen to him or her has no right to complain when
it does. For this reason, a defendant does not commit a tort when he
or  she  does  something  to  which  the  plaintiff  has  consented.  If  the
defendant  induces  his  or  her  consent  by  fraud,  however,  the  consent
does  not  have  this  effect  and  does  not  privilege  the  defendant's
conduct.  A  defendant  induces  consent  by  fraud  when  he  or  she
knowingly misrepresents the nature of the act to which the plaintiff is
consenting. Thus, if the hypnotist told the plaintiff that the cattle prod
would produce no real discomfort when he knew that this was false,
he  fraudulently  induced  her  consent  to  contact  with  it  and  was  not
privileged by her consent.

the  hypnotist  was  not  always  successful 

In A, the plaintiff consented to the contact even though she was aware
in  hypnotizing
that 
volunteers,  and  that  if  he  was  not  successful  in  hypnotizing  her,  the
cattle prod might cause discomfort. Since she knew the nature of the
act  to  which  she  was  consenting,  her  consent  would  furnish  the
hypnotist with a privilege. A is therefore incorrect. In B, although the
hypnotist defrauded the plaintiff by promising money that he did not
intend to pay, the fraud did not relate to the nature of the act to which
she  was  consenting.  He  would,  therefore,  be  privileged  by  her
consent, and B is therefore incorrect. A mistake that induces consent
does  not  destroy  the  effect  of  that  consent  unless  the  defendant  is
aware  of  the  mistake.  Since  there  is  no  indication  in  D  that  the
hypnotist was aware of the plaintiff's mistake regarding the effect of a
cattle prod, her consent privileged him, and D is therefore incorrect.

67. A A statement is defamatory if it is likely to cause a substantial group of
respectable  people  to  lose  respect  for  the  person  about  whom  it  is
made. A statement that the professor drank a large quantity of alcohol

1028

might  be  defamatory  because  many  people  regard  such  conduct  as
disreputable,  and  because  it  implies  that  the  professor's  public
statements were dishonest. A statement that she drank a large quantity
of  fruit  juice  clearly  would  not  be  defamatory.  If  an  allegedly
defamatory statement is ambiguous (i.e., has two possible meanings),
it is held to mean what the reasonable person would think it means.
Thus,  the  statements  made  in  the  photo  and  caption  would  not  have
been defamatory if the reasonable person would have believed them
to mean that the professor drank fruit juice. If the reasonable person
would have read the story, he or she would have known that this was
what the statements in the photo and caption meant.

B  and  C  are  incorrect  because  the  standard  used  to  determine  the
meaning of an ambiguous statement is objective and does not depend
on  what  any  particular  group  of  persons  thought.  D  is  incorrect
because  if  the  reasonable  person  would  not  have  read  the  story,  the
photo  and  caption  might  mean  that  the  professor  had  drunk  a  large
quantity of alcohol, and thus it might be a defamatory statement.

68. D Liability for misrepresentation may be imposed upon a defendant who
makes  an  intentionally  (or,  in  some  jurisdictions,  negligently)  false
assertion  of  fact  upon  which  the  plaintiff  justifiably  relies  to  his  or
her  detriment.  The  athlete's  only  assertion  of  fact  was  that  he  ate
candy  bars  for  energy.  There  is  no  indication,  however,  that  this
assertion was false. The athlete made no assertion about the flavor of
the  candy  bar,  so  even  if  the  plaintiff's  dislike  of  the  flavor  can  be
regarded as damage, it is not damage that proximately resulted from
his reliance on an assertion by the athlete.

A is incorrect because misrepresentation liability can be imposed on
anyone  who  makes  a  misrepresentation,  and  also  because  the  facts
indicate  that  the  athlete  is  in  the  business  of  selling  candy.  If  the
athlete's  statements  were  misrepresentations,  the  fact  that  he  said
them  could  result  in  liability  even  though  they  were  written  by
someone  else.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because
liability for intentional misrepresentation may be imposed to benefit
anyone  who  was  damaged  by  his  or  her  justified  reliance  on  the
misrepresentation, regardless of privity.

69.  B  Although  blasting  is  generally  recognized  to  be  an  ultra-hazardous
activity,  strict  liability  applies  only  to  harm  that  resulted  from  the
risks that made the activity ultra-hazardous. The possibility of noise

1029

frightening  animals  accompanies  a  great  many  activities  that  are  not
ultra-hazardous,  so  it  is  probably  not  one  of  the  risks  that  makes
blasting ultra-hazardous.

A is incorrect because the breeder's phone call announcing that harm
was  occurring  on  his  farm  made  it  foreseeable  that  harm  would
continue  to  occur  there  if  the  activity  was  continued.  C  is  incorrect
because  strict  liability  may  be  imposed  even  though  the  defendant
acted reasonably. While the demolition contractor's relationship with
the builder might impose liability on the builder as well, it would not
relieve  the  demolition  contractor  from  liability  for  his  acts.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

70. C An invitee is one whose presence confers an economic benefit on the
landholder.  That  which  enables  a  tenant  to  do  business  on  the
premises  confers  economic  benefit  on  the  landholder  by  making  the
premises  attractive  to  the  tenant.  This  applies  to  the  presence  of  a
tenant's  employees,  and  makes  them  invitees  of  the  landlord.
Contributory (comparative) negligence is unreasonable conduct by the
plaintiff. If the reasonable person in the employee's shoes would have
seen and avoided the dangerous condition, then the employee's failure
to do so was negligent.

71. C Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer is vicariously
liable for the negligence of an employee committed within the scope
of  employment.  An  employee  is  acting  within  the  scope  of
employment if his or her conduct is intended to further the interests of
his or her employer and if his or her employer has a right to control
his or her conduct. Since the building inspector was attempting to find
out  whether  the  drapes  were  fire-retardant,  which  was  part  of  what
the city hired her to do, and since the city had the right to tell her how
to  test  drapes,  she  was  acting  within  the  scope  of  her  employment
even if she was violating specific instructions that she received from
the city.

A is therefore incorrect. B is a fabrication with no basis in law, since
even  when  an  employee's  conduct  is  unsupervised,  respondeat
superior may result in the imposition of vicarious liability on his or
her employer. D is incorrect because under respondeat superior, an
employer is vicariously liable only for that for which the employee is
liable.

1030

72. C It may have been unreasonable for the defendant to leave his keys in
the  ignition.  If  so,  he  was  negligent.  Even  if  his  conduct  was  not
unreasonable, his violation of the ignition key statute may result in a
presumption  of  negligence  if  the  statute  was  designed  to  prevent
accidents  involving  stolen  cars.  Negligence  does  not  result  in
liability,  however,  unless  it  is  a  proximate  (i.e.,  factual  and  legal)
cause of harm. Conduct is a factual cause of harm if the harm would
not  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  the  monkey  probably  would  not
have moved the defendant's car and struck the plaintiff with it had the
defendant not left his key in the ignition, the defendant's conduct was a
factual  cause  of  the  plaintiff's  injury.  A  factual  cause  of  harm  is  a
legal cause if the harm was foreseeable and not brought about by an
unforeseeable intervening cause (i.e., a superseding cause). Since the
accident would not have occurred without the monkey's conduct, and
since the monkey's conduct came between the defendant's conduct and
the  plaintiff's  injury,  it  was  an  intervening  cause.  If  it  was
unforeseeable, it was a superseding cause of the plaintiff's harm, and
the  defendant's  conduct  was  not  a  proximate  cause  of  it.  Thus,  the
plaintiff will lose his case against the defendant unless it is found that
the monkey's intervention was foreseeable. This is unlikely.

Even if the defendant's conduct was reasonable, his violation of the
statute  might  result  in  a  presumption  of  negligence.  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  Even  if  the  violation  of  the  statute  does  not  result  in  a
presumption  of  negligence,  the  defendant's  conduct  might  have  been
unreasonable  and  therefore  negligent.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  an  intervening  cause  of  harm  is  not  superseding
unless it was unforeseeable.

73. A  Appropriation  of  identity  is  committed  when  the  defendant,  without
the plaintiff's permission, uses the plaintiff's identity for a commercial
purpose. Since the photographer sold games that were imprinted with
the  governor's  likeness,  a  court  could  conclude  that  he  is  liable  for
appropriation.

Public disclosure is committed when the defendant publicly discloses
a  private  fact  about  the  plaintiff,  the  disclosure  of  which  would
offend the reasonable person in the plaintiff's position. Since a photo
of  the  governor's  face  as  it  appeared  in  a  public  place  is  obviously
not  a  private  fact,  B  is  incorrect.  Intrusion  is  committed  by
intentionally  invading  the  plaintiff's  private  space  in  a  manner  that

1031

would offend the reasonable person in the plaintiff's position. Since
the  photographer  snapped  the  photo  in  a  public  place,  he  did  not
invade the governor's private space, and C is incorrect. False light is
committed  by  publishing  false  statements  about  the  plaintiff  that,
although not defamatory, are in some way embarrassing or damaging.
Since  the  photographer  did  not  publish  any  statements  about  the
governor, D is incorrect.

74.  D  False  imprisonment  requires  intentional  confinement,  which  is  an
overcoming  of  the  plaintiff's  will  to  leave.  Since  a  sleeping  person
has no will to leave, the student was not confined by the locked door.

A is therefore incorrect. B is based on an inaccurate statement since
the risk probably was not a foreseeable one, but it is incorrect in any
event  because  false  imprisonment  requires  intent.  If  the  professor
intentionally confined the student, she would be held liable for all the
harm that foreseeably resulted. C is incorrect, however, because she
did not confine him.

75.  A  In  a  defamation  action  by  a  private  person  against  a  professional
publisher  (media  defendant),  the  plaintiff  must  prove  either  actual
malice or negligence. If the newspaper knew the statement to be false,
it  had  actual  malice.  If  the  reasonable  publisher  would  have  known
the statement to be false, the newspaper acted negligently.

B describes actual malice and is incorrect because a plaintiff who is
not  a  public  person  is  not  required  to  prove  actual  malice.  C  is
incorrect because no liability can be imposed unless the newspaper
knew, or reasonably should have known, that the statement was false.
D  is  incorrect  since  liability  without  fault  cannot  be  imposed  in  an
action  for  defamation  against  a  professional  (media  defendant)
publisher.

76. C Strict liability means that the seller of a product is liable without fault
for personal injuries or other physical harm caused by the product if
the product is sold in a defective condition. Once a defect is found,
the  seller  is  liable  even  if  he  or  she  used  all  possible  care.
Importantly,  strict  liability  applies  not  only  to  the  manufacturer,  but
also to the retailer and any other person in the distribution chain who
is in the business of selling such products. Consequently, a retailer is
strictly liable for selling the defective product even if the retailer is
non-negligent  and  even  if  the  retailer  could  not  have  discovered  the

1032

defect.  Here,  since  the  defendant  sold  the  defective  product,  he  is
liable  even  though  he  sold  the  saws  without  opening  the  boxes  and
could not have possibly discovered the defect before the plaintiff was
injured. A and B are therefore incorrect.

There was no indication that selling saws made by the manufacturer
was unreasonable. D is therefore incorrect.

77.  A  Holders  of  land  owe  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  travelers  who
foreseeably  deviate  onto  the  land  for  reasons  related  to  their  use  of
the  adjacent  public  way.  Here,  the  fact  that  the  road  was  curvy  and
known  for  numerous  accidents  likely  made  the  driver's  accident
foreseeable.

B is incorrect because the mere fact that the homeowner knew drivers
used  the  neighboring  road  is  not  enough.  C  is  incorrect  because
although the reason given explains why the homeowner's conduct was
not  negligent,  it  fails  to  explain  why  he  had  no  duty.  Although  a
landholder generally owes no duty of reasonable care to a trespasser,
D  is  incorrect  because  a  strayed  traveler  as  described  above  is
entitled to reasonable care as an exception to the general rule.

78.  C  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm  would  not  have
occurred  without  it.  Since  medical  assistance  was  summoned  just  a
moment later, and since the facts do not indicate that the truck driver
was  worse  off  for  the  momentary  delay,  the  carpenter's  failure  to
summon aid was not a cause of harm.

Most jurisdictions agree that a landholder owes no duty of reasonable
care  to  a  trespasser.  When  the  landholder  knows  of  the  trespasser's
presence, however, and knows that the trespasser has been imperiled
by some affirmative act of the landholder, the landholder does have a
duty to act reasonably to protect the trespasser from that act. Since the
carpenter knew that his act of throwing the hammer created the need
for aid, he probably did owe the truck driver a duty to act reasonably
in summoning it. A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Punitive  damages  may  be
available  against  a  defendant  who  intended  harm  by  his  or  her  act.
Intent  requires  a  substantial  certainty  that  the  harm  will  probably
occur, however. Knowledge that harm is possible is not intent and is
not sufficient to result in liability for punitive damages. B is therefore
incorrect.  A  user  of  the  public  way  who  enters  upon  private  land
foreseeably and in connection with his or her use of the public way is

entitled to some measure of reasonable care. D is incorrect, however,
because  he  or  she  does  not  thereby  become  an  invitee,  and,  further,
because  the  truck  driver's  entry  onto  the  carpenter's  realty  was  not
connected with the truck driver's use of the public way.

79. C  A  private  individual  may  sue  for  public  nuisance  only  if  his  or  her
damages  were  different  in  kind  from  those  sustained  by  the  general
public.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  the  fact  that  the  defendant's  conduct
preexisted  the  plaintiff's  presence  is  not,  by  itself,  a  defense  to
nuisance unless it can be shown that the plaintiff came to the nuisance
specifically for the purpose of instituting litigation. D is an incorrect
statement  of  the  law;  even  a  lawful  activity  may  constitute  a  public
nuisance if it is conducted in a way that unreasonably interferes with
the rights of the public.

80.  C  Consent  —  the  plaintiff's  willingness  —  is  a  complete  defense  to
most  intentional  tort  actions.  Consent  is  implied  if  the  reasonable
person  would  infer  from  the  plaintiff's  conduct  and  the  surrounding
circumstances  that  the  plaintiff  is  willing  for  the  defendant's  act  to
occur. The fact that the defendant and the plaintiff have been enjoying
each  other's  jokes  for  years  could  result  in  the  inference  that  the
plaintiff was willing to have a joke played upon him. Although it is
not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the argument in
C is the only one listed that could support the defendant's defense.

A  is  incorrect  because  assault  requires  apprehension  of  harmful
contact  but  not  necessarily  of  battery.  Ordinarily,  the  apprehension
experienced  by  the  plaintiff  must  be  such  as  a  reasonable  person  in
his or her shoes would experience. B is incorrect, however, because
an exception to this objective standard is made when the plaintiff has
a  special  sensitivity  about  which  the  defendant  knows,  and  the
defendant  knew  that  the  plaintiff  was  terrified  of  spiders.  D  is
incorrect  because  assault  requires  an  intent  to  cause  apprehension,
not necessarily an intent to cause injury.

81.  C  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm  would  not  have
occurred  without  the  conduct.  Since  there  is  no  way  of  knowing
whether  the  defendant's  shot  struck  the  plaintiff,  it  cannot  be
established  that  the  plaintiff's  harm  was  factually  caused  by  the
defendant's conduct. (Note: Do not confuse these facts with the rule

1034

of Summers v. Tice, 199 P.2d 1 (1948) where both negligent persons
were named as defendants.)

The  defendant's  duty  of  reasonable  care  might  not  require  the  same
vigilance that would be required in an urban area, but A is incorrect
because  the  possibility  that  someone  would  come  by  required  some
vigilance. Since it is likely that a person struck by a pellet shot from a
slingshot would be seriously injured, it is probably unreasonable to
shoot a slingshot without taking some precaution against hitting other
persons.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  If  the  defendant's  conduct  was  a
factual cause of the harm, it was a legal cause of the harm if the harm
was foreseeable. Since it is clearly foreseeable that a person struck
by a slingshot pellet will sustain an injury, D is incorrect.

82.  C  Although  the  law  recognizes  a  special  standard  for  judging  the
negligence  of  children,  it  is  applied  only  when  the  youth  of  the
defendant  is  likely  to  prevent  him  or  her  from  exercising  the  same
mature  judgment  as  an  adult.  When  a  child  is  old  enough  to  have
acquired the judgment of an adult with respect to a particular activity,
the child standard no longer applies. It is rare for a court to apply the
child standard to persons over the age of 14 years.

A is therefore incorrect. An adult activity is one that is substantially
more  likely  to  be  dangerous  when  performed  by  a  child  than  by  an
adult, or one in which only adults traditionally engage. B is incorrect
because fishing is neither. The balancing test that is sometimes used
to  determine  whether  conduct  is  negligent  weighs  the  risks  that
foreseeably  result  from  acting  a  certain  way  against  the  utility  of
acting that particular way. D is incorrect because it distorts that rule
by weighing the risk of handling a fishhook in whatever way the girl
was handling it against the utility of fishing in general.

83.  A  Strict  liability  in  tort  is  imposed  on  the  supplier  of  a  product  for
damages that result from a defect in the product that existed at the time
it  left  that  supplier's  hands  and  that  made  the  product  unreasonably
dangerous.  Since  a  defect  is  a  condition  that  would  defeat  the
reasonable  expectations  of  the  reasonable  consumer,  and  since  the
reasonable  consumer  probably  does  not  expect  to  find  a  rat's  tail  in
food  products,  the  presence  of  a  rat's  tail  was  probably  a  defect.
Since  a  product  is  unreasonably  dangerous  if  the  benefits  of  its
condition are outweighed by its disadvantages, and since the presence
of a rat's tail has no advantage and is likely to be a source of disease

1035

and disgust in a person eating it, the presence of a rat's tail in a food
product probably makes that product unreasonably dangerous.

B is incorrect because strict liability in tort may be imposed for the
benefit  of  any  plaintiff  whose  contact  with  the  product  was
foreseeable,  without  regard  to  the  existence  of  a  contractual
relationship  (i.e.,  privity).  Although  the  sale  of  a  product  by  a
merchant implies a warranty that the product is merchantable (i.e., fit
for ordinary use), C is incorrect because the question stem specifies
the theory of strict liability in tort, and this theory does not depend on
the existence of an implied promise. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur
is  applied  to  establish  an  inference  that  the  defendant  acted
unreasonably. Since the reasonableness of the defendant's conduct is
not relevant to the imposition of strict liability, D is incorrect.

84.  C  A  parent's  claim  for  medical  bills  incurred  as  a  result  of  injuries
negligently  inflicted  on  a  child  is  a  derivative  one,  subject  to  any
defenses that could have been raised in response to an action by the
child.  Here,  the  boy's  negligence  could  be  asserted  by  the  driver  in
response to a claim by the boy. Additionally, since the mother is the
plaintiff, her negligence can be asserted by the driver. Consequently,
the driver can raise both the boy's and the boy's mother's negligence
as a defense.

85. D Violation of a statute is relevant to the question of negligence only if
the  statute  violated  was  designed  to  protect  a  class  of  persons  to
which the plaintiff belongs against risks like the one that resulted in
harm  to  the  plaintiff.  Since  insurance  would  not  have  prevented  the
trailer  hitch  from  failing,  the  statute  was  not  designed  to  protect
against the risk that it would. Its violation is therefore not relevant.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  violation  is  not
relevant  unless  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect  against  the  risk
involved. Public policy generally prohibits disclosing to a jury that a
defendant was or was not insured. Such disclosure is not absolutely
prohibited, however, since there are circumstances under which such
disclosure could be made to a jury (e.g., to establish ownership of a
vehicle). C  is  thus  based  on  an  over-inclusive  statement  of  the  law
and is therefore incorrect.

86. C An inference of negligence may be established under the doctrine of
res ipsa loquitur when the accident was one that would not ordinarily

1036

have  occurred  without  negligence,  and  the  circumstances  eliminate
the  probability  that  the  negligence  was  anyone's  but  the  defendant's.
Bottles  don't  usually  explode  unless  the  company  that  was  in
exclusive control of the bottling process acted negligently, so res ipsa
frequently  is  applied  in  exploding  bottle  cases.  But  where,  as  here,
some  other  event  was  as  likely  a  cause  of  the  explosion,  res  ipsa
cannot be applied.

A and B are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because the fact that
the bottles were not in the defendant's possession when the accident
occurred is not in itself sufficient to eliminate the probability that the
negligence was anyone's other than the defendant's.

87. B A person who sells services rather than goods does not generally fall
within standard strict liability. Consequently, since the contractor was
not  selling  the  glue  itself,  he  could  not  be  held  strictly  liable  for  its
defect. However, the neighbor could recover in strict liability against
the  manufacturer,  because  the  glue  was  defective,  was  sold  by  the
manufacturer, and proximately caused the injury to the neighbor.

A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

88.  C  An  essential  element  of  tort  liability  for  misrepresentation  is  the
defendant's  intent  to  induce  the  plaintiff's  reliance  with  his  or  her
statement. If the dealer did not know that the buyer would rely on the
statements that she made to the collector, she could not have intended
to  induce  the  buyer's  reliance  on  those  statements.  Since  there  is  no
indication that the dealer was aware that the buyer had overheard her
conversation with the collector, C is correct.

A  is  over-inclusive  and  therefore  incorrect.  Statements  of  opinion,
especially  when  made  by  experts,  may  be  regarded  as  assertions  of
fact  (i.e.,  the  fact  that  the  speaker  actually  held  that  particular
opinion).  Since  the  buyer  paid  $225,000  for  something  worth  only
$600  based  on  his  belief  in  what  he  had  overheard,  he  did  sustain
damage  as  a  result  of  his  reliance  on  the  dealer's  statement.  B  is
therefore incorrect. D is incorrect for two reasons. First, as indicated
above, an expert may incur misrepresentation liability by stating that
he  or  she  holds  an  opinion  that  he  or  she  doesn't  actually  hold.
Second,  the  dealer's  statement  was  not  only  an  evaluation  of  the
painting's value, but also a statement about who had painted it.

89.  D  Intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  requires  intentional,

1037

outrageous  conduct  that  results  in  severe  mental  suffering.  Since  the
plaintiff  did  not  experience  any  mental  injury,  the  defendant  is  not
liable to her for this tort.

Conduct  is  “outrageous”  if  it  exceeds  all  bounds  normally  tolerated
by decent society and is calculated to cause mental suffering. Conduct
is “calculated to cause mental suffering” if suffering in the mind of a
reasonable  person  is  an  almost  inevitable  result.  The  defendant's
conduct probably was both. A and B are incorrect, however, because
the  plaintiff  sustained  no  mental  injury.  Outrageous  conduct  is
“intentional”  if  the  defendant  desired  or  knew  with  substantial
certainty that it would result in mental suffering in the plaintiff. C is
incorrect  because  the  defendant  might  have  had  such  a  desire  or
knowledge, even though his motive was only to play a joke.

90.  D  A  seller  of  products  owes  his  or  her  customers  the  duty  to  act
reasonably.  If  it  would  be  reasonable  to  inspect  a  product  before
selling it, then the druggist owes his customers a duty of doing so.

A, B, and C are over-inclusive statements. Since some of the harmful
side  effects  or  defects  associated  with  a  particular  drug  might  be
unknown even to the reasonable druggist, a druggist cannot be said to
have a duty to know them all. (Note: A druggist who sells a defective
drug  may  be  held  strictly  liable  for  damages  that  result.  This  is
because  strict  liability  is  not  based  on  fault,  however,  and  does  not
justify the conclusion set forth in C.)

91. D Persons engaged in a concert of action are regarded as members of a
joint  enterprise.  As  such,  they  are  vicariously  liable  for  torts
committed by other members of the enterprise. Thus, the man and his
friend may each be held liable for the other's tort.

To  recover  against  either  or  both  of  them,  the  plaintiff  need  prove
only that his injury was caused by the negligence of some member of
the  enterprise.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  suggests  that  one  thing
cannot be a cause of harm if some other thing is. Since any effect may
have  more  than  one  cause,  B  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because
nothing can be a legal cause of harm unless it is a factual cause of that
harm.

92. D Negligence does not result in liability unless it was a proximate cause
of  damage.  Although  the  attorney's  failure  to  commence  the  patient's
action  against  the  doctor  was  probably  negligent,  no  liability  will

1038

result  unless  the  attorney's  negligence  was  a  proximate  cause  of
damage. If the patient would have lost her lawsuit against the doctor
anyway,  the  attorney's  failure  to  institute  it  did  not  result  in  damage
since the patient lost nothing as a result. If the doctor's use of the drug
did not result in damage to the patient, the doctor would not have been
liable to her even if her conduct was negligent. If the drug saved the
patient's  life  at  the  expense  of  her  eye,  it  probably  did  not  result  in
damage, since what the patient gained from its use exceeded what she
lost. This means that the patient would have lost her lawsuit against
the doctor, and that the attorney's failure to assert it did not result in
damage.

A  is  incorrect  because  even  an  inexperienced  lawyer  is  required  to
act  as  the  reasonable  attorney.  The  attorney's  honest  belief  is  no
defense unless the reasonable attorney would have held it. B and C
are therefore incorrect.

93. C Under pure comparative negligence statutes, a plaintiff's recovery in a
negligence  action  is  diminished  in  proportion  to  the  plaintiff's  fault,
but  it  is  not  barred  by  the  plaintiff's  own  negligence.  Thus,  the
plaintiff  would  be  entitled  to  recover  part  of  any  damages  that  she
sustained  as  a  result  of  the  defendant's  conduct  if  the  defendant's
conduct was unreasonable.

In most jurisdictions, a landholder owes a duty of reasonable care to
an  invitee  but  owes  no  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  a  trespasser.  For
this purpose, an invitee is one whose presence confers an economic
benefit on the landholder, and a trespasser is one who enters without
permission.  Since  the  plaintiff's  use  of  the  defendant's  pool  was
consideration  for  valuable  services  that  she  rendered,  she  was  an
invitee. Under the “attractive nuisance” doctrine, a trespassing child
may be entitled to reasonable care, but it is inapplicable here because
the  plaintiff  was  an  invitee  rather  than  a  trespasser.  A  and  B  are
therefore  incorrect.  If  the  plaintiff's  conduct  was  unreasonable,  the
amount  of  her  damages  would  be  diminished  accordingly.  The
language  of  option  D  may  suggest  defenses  based  on  comparative
negligence and on assumption of the risk. If it suggests a comparative
negligence  defense,  it  is  incorrect  because  in  a  pure  comparative
negligence system, the plaintiff's recovery is diminished in proportion
to  his  or  her  own  fault  but  is  not  barred  completely.  In  most
jurisdictions, assumption of the risk is a complete bar to recovery by

1039

the plaintiff. A plaintiff assumes the risk when he or she voluntarily
encounters  a  risk  of  which  he  or  she  knows.  The  knowledge
requirement is subjective, meaning that unless the plaintiff himself or
herself  was  aware  of  the  risk,  the  fact  that  the  reasonable  person
would  have  been  aware  is  irrelevant.  D  is  also  incorrect  for  this
reason,  and  because  the  facts  indicate  that  the  plaintiff  dove  in
without looking and was thus unaware that the pool was empty.

94. C Since the plaintiff entered without the company's permission, she was
a trespasser. Ordinarily, a landholder owes trespassers, even if they
are  children,  no  duty  of  reasonable  care  with  respect  to  dangerous
conditions  of  the  premises.  A  trespassing  child  may  be  entitled  to
reasonable  care,  however,  if  it  was  foreseeable  that  children  would
trespass,  it  was  foreseeable  that  a  child  who  trespassed  would  be
injured,  and  if  the  child  was  too  young  to  comprehend  the  danger.
Thus,  if  the  plaintiff  was  old  enough  to  comprehend  the  danger
associated  with  an  attempt  to  climb  the  pole,  the  company  owed  no
duty of reasonable care to protect her against it. Although a minority
of  jurisdictions  holds  that  a  landholder  owes  a  duty  of  reasonable
care  to  all  who  enter,  C  is  correct  because  it  is  the  only  argument
listed that could provide the company with an effective defense in any
jurisdiction.

A  is  incorrect  because  under  the  rule  stated  above,  a  duty  of
reasonable care may be owed to a trespassing child. The fact that no
child had ever before attempted to climb the pole would not prevent
the rule from being applied if it was foreseeable that a child would
do  so  in  the  future.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because
even if the company could not repair the fence, there may have been
other  steps  that  the  reasonable  person  in  the  company's  position
would have taken to prevent the danger that resulted in the plaintiff's
injury.

95.  B  The  homeowner's  lawsuit  may  be  founded  either  on  negligence  or
upon  strict  products  liability.  Negligence  involves  unreasonable
conduct.  If  the  explosives  were  properly  labeled,  the  company's
conduct was not unreasonable. Strict liability is imposed only if the
product that caused harm left the defendant in a defective condition. A
product may be defective because of the way in which it is labeled,
but  if  the  labels  were  properly  affixed  when  the  cases  left  the
company's plant, the product was not defective at the time it left the

1040

company's hands.

A is incorrect because strict liability may be imposed even though the
defendant acted reasonably. C is incorrect because the negligence of
a company employee would be imputed to the company. Although the
storage  of  explosives  is  usually  regarded  as  an  ultra-hazardous
activity, resulting in the imposition of strict liability upon one storing
it,  D  would  not  furnish  the  company  with  a  defense  since  the
imposition  of  liability  on  the  warehouse  would  not  prevent  liability
from being imposed on the company.

96. D A private nuisance is liability-forming conduct by the defendant that
unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy his
or her property. Liability is formed if the defendant intends to invade
the  plaintiff's  rights.  After  speaking  with  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant
now intends his invasion because he is now acting with either desire
or  substantial  certainty  that  the  interfering  conduct  will  occur.
Consequently,  if  the  interference  is  unreasonable,  the  defendant  is
liable. This is the only theory listed that could result in a judgment for
the plaintiff.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  theory  requires  some  physical  intrusion
into the plaintiff's presence, and there is no indication the restaurant
or the college kids are doing so. B is incorrect because the plaintiff is
not complaining of or seeking damages for severe mental suffering. C
is  incorrect  because  trespass  requires  tangible  entry  onto  the
plaintiff's land, and none has occurred.

97. D Misappropriation of identity is an invasion of privacy that consists of
the  unauthorized  use  of  the  plaintiff's  identity  for  a  commercial
purpose. Since the cigar company used the comedian's name without
his permission for the purpose of selling its product, it has committed
this tort against the comedian.

Although the truth of the statement made in the advertisements might
justify  its  publication  for  some  purposes,  its  use  for  a  commercial
purpose  is  not  privileged.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Although  the
protection  of  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution
has been extended to commercial expression, it has not been extended
to  the  unauthorized  use  of  another's  identity  for  a  commercial
purpose. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because liability for
misappropriation of identity does not depend on the foreseeability of

1041

the defendant's conduct.

98. A Tort liability may be imposed only for harm that resulted from intent,
negligence, or any activity for which strict liability may be imposed.
Since there is no indication that the defendant intended the harm, and
since  her  activity  was  not  an  abnormally  dangerous  one,  the  only
theory available to the plaintiff is negligence. Negligence is a breach
of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  The  duty  exists  if  the  defendant's
conduct creates a foreseeable risk to the plaintiff. Since the operation
of a motor vehicle on a roadway creates foreseeable risks to persons
owning property along the roadway, the operator of a vehicle owes a
duty of reasonable care to such persons. The question of whether the
defendant breached that duty depends on whether the defendant acted
reasonably.

A professional seller of products (i.e., a merchant) may be held liable
for damage resulting from a defect in a product that he or she supplied
on theories of strict liability in tort or breach of the implied warranty
of  merchantability.  Since  the  defendant  did  not  supply  the  trailer,
however,  neither  of  these  theories  can  be  applied  to  her.  Thus,  the
questions of whether the hitch was defective or whether the defendant
was  a  merchant  are  not  relevant.  B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.
Although negligence liability is often made to depend on whether the
reasonable  person  in  the  position  of  the  defendant  would  have
foreseen  the  harm,  D  is  incorrect  because  it  is  never  necessary  that
the harm be foreseeable to the plaintiff.

99. A  The  old  rule  that  “he  or  she  who  holds  the  land  holds  upward  unto
heaven”  is  no  longer  true.  All  jurisdictions  agree  that  a  flight  over
land is a trespass to the land only if it was below a certain altitude
(although  they  frequently  disagree  about  what  that  altitude  is).  Thus,
unless the woman can prove the altitude at which the pilot hovered,
she cannot establish a trespass.

B is incorrect because damage is not an essential element of an action
for trespass to land. C is incorrect since an action for trespass is not
one  for  invasion  of  privacy,  but  rather  for  invasion  of  the  right  to
exclusive  possession  of  realty.  D  is  incorrect  because  even  one
whose possession is unlawful may sue for trespass.

100. D A person entitled to possess a chattel who enters the realty of another
for the purpose of recovering that chattel is privileged to make such

1042

entry,  provided  that  he  or  she  does  so  in  a  reasonable  manner  (and
provided further that the chattel did not get onto the realty through any
fault  of  his  or  her  own).  The  woman's  entry  onto  the  homeowner's
realty  was  therefore  privileged.  Since  the  woman's  entry  was
privileged, the homeowner was not entitled to use force against her to
defend his realty, and his use of such force constituted a battery.

A  privilege  to  use  force  against  the  wrongful  dispossessor  of  a
chattel  exists  only  when  that  force  is  used  in  hot  pursuit  of  the
dispossessor.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  hot  pursuit  is  not  a
prerequisite to the privilege to enter realty to recover a chattel. B is
incorrect  because  injury  is  not  an  essential  element  of  battery.  C  is
incorrect  because  a  possessor  of  realty  is  privileged  to  use
reasonable force to prevent a trespass to that realty.

101.  C  An  action  for  misrepresentation  requires  proof  that  the  defendant
made  a  statement  that  he  or  she  knew  or  should  have  known  was
false,  for  the  purpose  of  inducing  plaintiff's  reliance,  and  that  the
plaintiff  was  damaged  by  his  or  her  justified  reliance  on  the
statement.  The  facts  given  establish  that  the  employee  made
statements to the husband for the purpose of inducing him to settle his
claim.  The  husband's  independent  consultation  with  the  attorney
would at least create a jury question about whether the husband was
acting  in  reliance  on  the  employee's  statements.  The  fact  that  the
wrongful death suit would have resulted in a judgment for the husband
in  excess  of  $1,000  would  have  to  be  proven  to  establish  that  the
employee's  statements  were  false  and  that  the  husband's  reliance  on
them led to damages. The fact that the employee knew or should have
known  that  the  statements  were  false  would  have  to  be  proven  to
show that the employee had the necessary fault.

102.  D  Private  nuisance  may  consist  of  an  intentional  and  unreasonable
interference with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy his or her realty.
Interference is intentional if the defendant is substantially certain that
it will occur. Since the company continued testing dog whistles after
the breeder notified it that the testing procedure was interfering with
the  breeder's  business,  the  interference  with  the  breeder's  use  and
enjoyment  of  land  was  intentional.  The  interference  was  not
unreasonable,  however,  unless  the  company's  conduct  would  have
interfered with ordinary use or enjoyment of the breeder's realty. So,
if the breeder's damage resulted from an unusually sensitive use of the

1043

breeder's  land,  it  would  not  be  the  result  of  an  unreasonable
interference.  Since  only  dogs  could  hear  the  sound,  and  since  most
people  are  not  in  the  business  of  keeping  dogs,  the  argument  in  D
might  be  successful.  Of  the  arguments  listed,  it  is  the  only  one  that
could possibly be successful.

A  is  incorrect  because  even  a  lawful  business  may  constitute  a
private nuisance if it is operated in a way that unreasonably interferes
with  the  use  and  enjoyment  of  the  plaintiff's  realty.  B  is  incorrect
because  if  a  defendant's  activity  unreasonably  interferes  with
plaintiff's  use  and  enjoyment  of  his  or  her  realty,  the  fact  that  the
defendant was engaging in it before the plaintiff arrived is not in itself
sufficient  to  prevent  that  activity  from  being  characterized  as  a
nuisance.  Since  the  intent  requirement  is  satisfied  by  the  company's
knowledge  that  its  activity  was  interfering  with  the  breeder's  use  of
his land, C is also incorrect.

103. A An express warranty is a representation regarding a condition of the
product sold. Liability for breach of express warranty is imposed on
the warrantor, regardless of fault, if the product's failure to be what it
was  represented  to  be  results  in  damage.  If  the  label  said  that  the
product would not harm the skin, the fact that it harmed the plaintiff's
skin would be a breach of warranty.

Although  liability  may  be  imposed  for  the  breach  of  an  implied
warranty  of  fitness  for  ordinary  use  (i.e.,  merchantability),  express
warranty liability requires some assertion of fact about the product. B
is  therefore  incorrect.  Liability  for  breach  of  express  warranty  is
imposed on whoever made the warranty that was breached. A retailer
who delivers a product makes whatever warranties are printed on its
label.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  liability  for
breach of express warranty is imposed without regard to fault.

104.  A  As  a  general  rule,  the  courts  hold  that  the  coming  of  a  rescuer  is
foreseeable. This is what is meant by the well-known phrase “Danger
invites  rescue.”  For  this  reason,  one  who  unreasonably  creates  a
danger to any human being — including himself or herself — creates
a  risk  to  a  potential  rescuer  as  well  and  owes  a  potential  rescuer  a
duty  of  reasonable  care.  Thus,  if  the  defendant's  conduct  was
unreasonable, it was a breach of a duty he owed the plaintiff.

B is based on an over-inclusive statement of law — a rescuer's right

1044

to  collect  from  the  person  whom  he  or  she  rescued  must  be  based
either  on  the  breach  of  duty  to  act  reasonably  or  on  an  implied
contract.  An  officious  intermeddler  is  a  person  who  acts  without  a
legitimate reason. C  is  incorrect  because  a  human  life  was  at  stake,
giving  the  plaintiff  a  legitimate  reason  to  act.  The  rule  that  is
characterized  by  the  phrase  “Danger  invites  rescue”  makes  D
incorrect  because  the  rescuer's  attempt  to  rescue  the  defendant  is
regarded as foreseeable for the reason given.

105. B Negligence is a failure to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable
risk. If it was not foreseeable that the contents of the package would
cause  harm  to  a  passenger  in  her  car,  the  defendant's  conduct  with
respect  to  the  package  could  not  have  been  negligent.  Although  it  is
not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the argument in
B is the only one listed that is supported by the facts.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  rule  limiting  the  duty  owed  to  a  licensee
applies  only  to  conditions  of  realty  occupied  by  a  defendant.
Contributory negligence is unreasonable conduct by the plaintiff that
contributes to the happening of the accident. Since the plaintiff could
not have known that the contents of the package were caustic, there is
no  reason  to  conclude  that  his  conduct  was  unreasonable.  C  is
therefore incorrect. A plaintiff is said to have assumed the risk when
he or she voluntarily encounters a known risk. D is incorrect because
the  plaintiff  did  not  know  that  the  contents  of  the  package  were
caustic, and touching it did not, therefore, constitute an encounter with
a known risk.

106. A Strict liability in tort may be imposed upon a professional supplier of
products who places a defective product into the stream of commerce.
Since  a  tattoo  artist  does  not  sell  tattoo  needles  to  his  or  her
customers, he or she does not place them in the stream of commerce,
and  he  or  she  cannot  be  held  strictly  liable  for  damage  that  results
from his or her customer's contact with them.

B  is  incorrect  because  strict  liability  is  imposed  regardless  of  fault
and therefore may be imposed on a defendant although he or she did
not  exercise  any  control  over  the  quality  of  the  product.  A  plaintiff
assumes a risk when he or she knows of it and voluntarily encounters
it. Although the defendant informed the plaintiff that the process was
likely to be a painful one, there is no indication that the plaintiff knew
that the needle would break off in her skin. C is therefore incorrect.

1045

Strict  liability  may  be  imposed  upon  the  supplier  of  defective
products  without  regard  to  whether  those  products  would  be
dangerous  without  the  defect  (i.e.,  inherently  dangerous).  D  is
therefore incorrect.

107.  C  False  imprisonment  consists  of  the  intentional  confinement  of  the
plaintiff. Confinement is an overcoming of the plaintiff's will to leave
in  a  manner  that  would  overcome  the  reasonable  person's  will  to
leave. Since the reasonable person usually obeys the directions of a
police officer, the police officer's words would have been sufficient
to overcome the reasonable person's will to leave. For this reason, if
the  police  officer's  language  overcame  the  walker's  will  to  leave,  it
confined him.

A is incorrect because if it was reasonable for the walker to believe
that an attempt to leave would result in some harm to him, then he was
confined even though no physical barriers prevented him from getting
out  of  the  police  car.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  police  officer's
assertion of legal authority and threatening language would have made
any protest by the walker a futile — and thus unnecessary — gesture.
D  is  incorrect  because  damage  is  not  an  essential  element  of  false
imprisonment.

108.  B  A  defendant  owes  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  a  plaintiff  if  the
defendant's  conduct  creates  a  foreseeable  risk  to  that  plaintiff.  A
foreseeable  risk  is  a  danger  that  a  reasonable  person  would
anticipate.  If  the  driver's  conduct  created  no  foreseeable  risks  to
persons in the hospital, the driver did not owe such persons a duty of
reasonable care and could not be held liable to them for negligence.

is  so,  however,  only 

The intervening act of a third person may be a superseding cause of
harm,  relieving  the  original  wrongdoer  of  liability  for  the  plaintiff's
injuries.  This 
intervention  was
unforeseeable. A is incorrect because the negligence of a surgeon is
usually  regarded  as  foreseeable.  C  is  similarly  incorrect  because
even aggravated negligence may be foreseeable. Since any result may
have  several  causes,  the  fact  that  the  scars  were  caused  by  the
conduct  of  the  doctor  does  not  establish  that  they  were  not  also
caused by the negligence of the driver. D is therefore incorrect.

the 

if 

109.  B  There  can  be  no  liability  for  making  defamatory  statements  unless
those  statements  are  false.  Statements  that  are  expressions  of  the

1046

writer's  feelings  regarding  subjective  matters  are  statements  of
opinion, and opinions are neither true nor false. Since the quality of
the plaintiff's writing is a subjective matter, the defendant's statements
are  opinions.  Statements  of  opinion  can  be  defamatory  only  if  the
reasonable  person  would  interpret  the  statements  as  fact.  Here,  the
nature  of  the  defendant's  statements  makes  them  unlikely  to  be
interpreted as facts.

A media defendant may be held liable for defaming a public figure if
the defamatory statements were made with actual malice. A and C are
therefore  incorrect.  Although  a  businessperson  may  be  privileged  to
compete  by  making  unflattering  reference  to  his  or  her  competitor's
products,  D  is  incorrect  because  the  privilege  is  qualified  by  the
requirement of good faith.

110. A A professional supplier who sells a product in a defective condition
is  strictly  liable  for  harm  that  proximately  results  from  the  defect.
Here, since the jury found the machine was the proximate cause of the
employee's injury, the manufacturer is strictly liable for it.

B is incorrect because the manufacturer's liability would not be based
on  whether  it  was  reasonable  in  its  offers  to  make  a  repair.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  machine  was  defective  when  it  was  placed  in
the  stream  of  commerce,  and  nothing  happened  to  change  its
condition.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  unreasonable  conduct  of  an
intervenor  is  not  a  superseding  cause  of  harm  unless  it  is
unforeseeable.  Here,  an  owner  of  the  machine  not  wanting  to  pay
$1,000 for a repair is likely foreseeable.

111.  C  A  defendant  is  liable  only  for  harm  caused  by  his  or  her  conduct.
Conduct is a cause of harm only if the harm would not have occurred
without  that  conduct.  If  the  passenger's  harm  would  have  occurred
without  the  man's  conduct,  the  man's  conduct  could  not  have  been  a
cause of the passenger's harm.

Although  the  violation  of  a  statute  is  relevant  to  the  issue  of
negligence  if  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect  persons  like  the
plaintiff against risks like that which produced the plaintiff's harm, A
would not be an effective defense for two reasons. First, the fact that
the statute was designed to protect schoolchildren does not prove that
it  was  not  also  designed  to  protect  automobile  passengers.  Second,
even  if  the  statutory  violation  is  not  relevant  to  the  issue  of

1047

negligence, the passenger might succeed in establishing common law
negligence (i.e., that the man failed to act reasonably). An intervening
cause  of  harm  may  be  a  superseding  cause  that  shifts  responsibility
from the original wrongdoer to the intervenor, but only if the conduct
of the intervenor was unforeseeable. Since the negligence of motorists
is  a  common  occurrence,  the  woman's  negligence  was  probably
foreseeable. B and D are therefore incorrect.

112.  B  Since  the  two  defendants  were  found  to  be  jointly  and  severally
liable, the plaintiff can collect the entire amount of his judgment from
either  of  them  or  from  both  of  them  in  any  combination.  Under  the
pure  comparative  negligence  statute  that  existed  in  the  jurisdiction,
the  plaintiff's  judgment  should  be  for  the  amount  of  his  damages,
diminished in proportion to his own fault. Since the plaintiff's injury
was  found  to  have  resulted  20  percent  from  the  plaintiff's  own
negligence, his judgment should be for $100,000 less 20 percent, or
$80,000.

A is incorrect because it does not diminish the plaintiff's recovery in
proportion  to  his  fault.  C  is  incorrect  because  joint  tortfeasors  are
jointly  and  severally  liable.  In  an  all-or-nothing  contributory
negligence  jurisdiction,  a  plaintiff  who  was  contributorily  negligent
will  receive  nothing,  even  though  the  defendant  may  have  been
negligent  as  well.  Under  the  “pure  comparative  negligence”  statute
given,  however,  the  plaintiff's  recovery  is  not  completely  barred  by
his negligence. D is therefore incorrect.

113.  D  Vicarious  liability  only  occurs  when  there  is  an  employment
relationship (or, occasionally, an independent contractor relationship)
between  the  defendant  and  the  tortfeasor.  While  the  defendant  could
be liable for inadequate security or negligently allowing the tortfeasor
to come onto the premises, the defendant cannot be found liable under
the principle of vicarious liability for torts committed by a customer.
A  is  therefore  incorrect.  “General  liability”  is  not  a  principle  for
holding a party liable. B is therefore incorrect. Strict liability comes
into  play  with  defective  products,  keeping  wild  or  other  dangerous
animals,  or  carrying  out  abnormally  dangerous  activities.  Here,  the
question  involves  none  of  these  three  scenarios.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.

114. D Invasion of privacy by public disclosure of private facts consists of
publishing offensive and previously unknown facts about the plaintiff.

1048

The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held,  however,  that  First
Amendment guarantees of free expression prohibit imposing liability
for the publication of facts that are already matters of public record.
The  Court  said  that  this  rule  applies  even  to  facts  that  are  not
commonly known, since the press often serves as eyes and ears for a
public too busy to search public records for itself.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  for  the  above  reason.  B  is  also  incorrect
because a privilege to publish information about one who is involved
in a matter of public interest may exist even though that person is not a
public employee. C  is  incorrect  because  although  publication  of  the
truth  cannot  lead  to  liability  for  defamation,  publication  of  private
facts  that  are  not  newsworthy  may  result  in  liability  when  it  would
offend the reasonable person, even if those facts are true.

115. C  Trespass  to  land  consists  of  intentional  unauthorized  entry  on  realty
possessed by the plaintiff. There is no requirement of damage. Since
the landowner's complaint gave the factory knowledge that dust from
its operation was settling on the cabin, and since the factory thereafter
continued  operating  as  it  had  been,  the  necessary  intent  is  present
(i.e.,  the  factory  was  substantially  certain  that  entry  would  occur).
Some  cases  have  held  that  the  settling  of  dust  constitutes  a  tangible
entry on affected realty; other cases have held that it does not. For this
reason,  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  find  that  a  trespass
occurred.  Of  all  the  theories  listed,  however,  trespass  to  land  is  the
only one that might possibly result in a judgment for the landowner.

Invasion  of  privacy  by  intrusion  involves  an  interference  with  the
plaintiff's  interest  in  solitude  and  requires  some  kind  of  prying  into
the  plaintiff's  affairs  or  private  life.  This  did  not  occur  here.  Other
privacy  theories  —  appropriation,  public  disclosure,  false  light  —
are  not  even  remotely  applicable.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Unlike
trespass,  which  requires  no  damage,  nuisance  liability  is  imposed
only  where  the  plaintiff  has  sustained  some  substantial  harm.  An
individual may assert a public nuisance claim only if the harm that he
or she sustained differed from that sustained by the general public. B
is  incorrect  for  these  reasons.  An  abnormally  dangerous  activity  is
one  that  necessarily  involves  a  serious  risk  of  harm  that  cannot  be
eliminated  by  acting  reasonably.  Since  there  are  no  facts  indicating
that the use of unbagged cement is such an activity, D is incorrect.

116. D When tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable, a plaintiff is entitled

1049

to  collect  all  his  or  her  damages  from  any  one  of  them  (i.e.,
“severally”), or to collect his or her damages from them together (i.e.,
“jointly”)  in  any  combination  whatsoever.  Since  the  court  held  the
company,  the  employee,  and  the  driver  to  be  jointly  and  severally
liable  to  her,  the  passenger  is  entitled  to  collect  100  percent  of  her
damages from the employee if she chooses to do so.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect. (Note: Comparative negligence
statutes  determine  the  effect  of  the  plaintiff's  fault.  Since  the  jury
found the plaintiff to be free of fault, the existence of a comparative
negligence  statute 
law
contribution systems give joint tortfeasors certain rights against each
other, but do not affect a plaintiff's right to collect from them jointly
and/or severally.)

irrelevant.  Statutory  and  common 

is 

117. C That joint tortfeasors are “jointly and severally liable” means that the
plaintiff  may  collect  all  his  or  her  damages  from  either  of  them  or
from  both  of  them  in  any  combination.  Obviously,  however,  the  fact
that there are multiple tortfeasors does not entitle a plaintiff to collect
his or her damages more than once. Since the defendants were jointly
and  severally  liable  to  the  plaintiff  for  $100,000,  the  plaintiff  is
entitled  to  collect  $100,000  from  either  or  both  of  them  in  any
combination.  Since  the  plaintiff  has  already  received  $10,000  from
the  first  defendant,  she  is  entitled  to  collect  the  remaining  $90,000
from the second defendant.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  a  statute  basing  contribution  on
apportionment  of  fault  affects  the  rights  that  joint  tortfeasors  have
against  each  other,  but  it  does  not  affect  their  joint  and  several
liability  to  the  plaintiff.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff  has
already received $10,000 from the first defendant, and to allow her to
collect  an  additional  $100,000  from  the  second  defendant  would
result in her collecting her damages more than once.

118. B In jurisdictions that follow pure comparative negligence, the plaintiff's

Consequently,  the  $100,000  in  damages  was  75  percent  the  fault  of
the plaintiff, so he should only recover 25 percent of the damages, or
$25,000.

A  is  incorrect  because  in  a  pure  comparative  fault  jurisdiction,  the

not  relieve  the  defendant  from  liability.  C  is  incorrect,  because  the

plaintiff would not be entitled to damages that could be attributed to

be reduced by the amount of his negligence.

119. B Self-defense is a privilege to use reasonable force to protect oneself
against  a 
tortious  contact  or  confinement.  Some
jurisdictions hold that it is never reasonable to use deadly force when
it is reasonably safe to retreat. But even in those jurisdictions that do
not  require  retreat,  the  defendant's  privilege  is  likely  to  turn  on
whether he knew or should have known that he could safely retreat. In
connection  with  the  privilege  of  self-defense,  “reasonable  force”
means the force that would have appeared necessary to the reasonable
person  in  the  defendant's  situation.  If  the  defendant  knew  or  should
have known that he could safely and easily retreat without sustaining
harm, the reasonable person in his situation would probably not have
considered it necessary to use any force at all in self-defense. On the
other hand, if the defendant could not have known that he could safely
and  easily  retreat,  the  reasonable  person  in  his  situation  might  have
considered the use of a knife necessary because of the extreme danger
facing a person who has a pistol pointed at him.

Deadly force may be reasonable in self-defense if the person using it
is  being  threatened  by  what  reasonably  appears  to  be  deadly  force.
Since the plaintiff was threatening the defendant with a pistol, the use
of a knife — even if it was deadly force — may have been privileged
in  self-defense.  For  this  reason,  A  is  incorrect.  If  the  defendant
initiated the aggression by slapping the plaintiff, then the plaintiff was
privileged  to  use  reasonable  force  to  defend  himself  against  the
possibility of further blows by the defendant. Thus, if the force with
which the plaintiff threatened the defendant was reasonable, it would
have  been  privileged  and  therefore  not  tortious.  If  that  was  so,  then
the defendant would not have been privileged to use force to defend
himself against it. (This reasoning accounts for the rule that an initial
aggressor is not privileged to use force to defend himself or herself
against a reasonable response to his or her aggression.) If, however,
the plaintiff's use of a pistol was unreasonable (i.e., excessive force),
it  was  not  privileged  by  self-defense.  Then,  the  contact  with  which
the  plaintiff  threatened  the  defendant  would  have  been  tortious,  and
the defendant would have been privileged to defend himself against it
by using reasonable force. Thus, even if the defendant was the initial
aggressor,  he  might  have  been  privileged  to  use  a  knife  to  defend

1051

himself  against  the  plaintiff's  use  of  a  gun.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.
Since reasonable force depends on what the reasonable person in the
defendant's  situation  would  have  considered  necessary, 
the
defendant's  privilege  depends  on  how  the  defendant  perceived  or
should  have  perceived  the  threat  with  which  he  was  confronted.
Whether  or  not  the  plaintiff  knew  that  the  pistol  was  loaded,  the
defendant's  use  of  a  knife  might  have  been  reasonable  if  the
defendant  believed  that  the  pistol  was  loaded.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

120. D  A  person  who  keeps  a  wild  animal  is  strictly  liable  for  all  damage
done by that animal so long as that damage results from a dangerous
propensity that is typical of the animal's species. Importantly, the fact
that the average person fears a particular type of animal is part of that
animal's dangerous propensities. Here, although the lion may not have
harmed  the  plaintiff  in  any  way,  the  defendant  is  strictly  liable
because humans' fear of unrestrained lions is part of what makes lions
dangerous. Importantly, that fear caused the plaintiff to drop the pot of
grease  onto  her  foot.  C is  therefore  incorrect.  Whether  an  animal  is
known to be dangerous comes into play when determining liability for
domestic  animals.  A  lion  is  certainly  not  a  domestic  animal  (like  a
cat, dog, or hamster). A is therefore incorrect. Because the defendant
can be held strictly liable, the defendant's negligence is irrelevant. B
is therefore incorrect.

121. C The law of torts knows only three possible bases of liability: intent,
negligence,  and  strict  liability.  Since  intent  is  desire  or  knowledge
with  substantial  certainty  that  harm  will  occur,  and  since  the  store
owner did not desire or know that any person would be struck by the
door,  no  recovery  is  possible  on  an  intent  theory.  Although  strict
liability  is  imposed  on  the  sellers  of  defective  products,  strict
liability  is  not  available  against  the  store  owner  because  the  store
owner  did  not  sell  the  product  that  injured  the  customer.  The  only
remaining theory is negligence, which involves unreasonable conduct
in  the  face  of  a  duty  of  reasonable  care.  Since  the  customer  entered
the premises for the purpose of making a purchase, he is an invitee.
The duty owed to an invitee is to keep the premises reasonably safe
by making reasonable inspections and reasonable repairs. Thus, if a
reasonable  inspection  would  have  disclosed  the  problem,  then  the
store  owner  was  either  negligent  in  not  inspecting  or  negligent  in
failing  to  discover  what  a  reasonable  inspection  would  have

1052

disclosed.

A is incorrect because only a professional seller of products like the
one  that  caused  injury  can  be  held  strictly  liable  for  defects  in  that
product.  The  liability  of  a  defendant  does  not  depend  upon  the
availability of remedies against others. Thus, even if the fact that the
contractor  was  not  negligent  might  leave  the  customer  without  a
remedy,  it  would  not  affect  the  liability  of  the  store  owner.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  A  landholder  owes  an  invitee  a  duty  of
reasonable care to keep the premises reasonably safe, while he or she
owes  a  lesser  duty  to  licensees  and  trespassers.  For  this  reason,  it
might be relevant to determine whether the customer entered the store
owner's premises as an invitee. An invitee is one whose presence is
likely to confer an economic benefit on the landholder or one who has
entered the premises in response to a public invitation. Supermarkets
ordinarily  invite  the  public  (either  expressly  or  impliedly)  to  enter
their premises for the purpose of examining their wares. In addition,
the courts usually hold that a person who is likely to buy confers an
economic  benefit  by  entering  business  premises,  even  if  he  or  she
does not actually make a purchase while there. For these two reasons,
the customer was an invitee whether or not he made a purchase before
leaving. D is therefore incorrect.

122.  C  Battery  is  committed  by  intentionally  causing  harmful  or  offensive
contact  with  another  person.  Since  there  was  no  contact  with  the
plaintiff, he could not successfully maintain a battery claim.

A, B, and D are incorrect for the above reason.

123. B  False  imprisonment  is  committed  by  intentionally  confining  another
person.  For 
the
plaintiff's will to leave. If the ex-husband's father did not prevent the
plaintiff from leaving, he did not confine her and could not be liable
to her for false imprisonment.

this  purpose,  “confining”  means  overcoming 

A  is  incorrect  because  damage  is  not  an  essential  element  of  false
imprisonment.  Although  the  ex-husband's  father's  conduct  may  have
prevented the plaintiff from obtaining physical custody of her son, the
plaintiff cannot maintain an action for false imprisonment unless she
herself was confined. C and D are therefore incorrect.

124. A Since the facts do not indicate that the defendant intended contact with
the boy or harm of any kind to the plaintiff, the only claim that could

1053

possibly  succeed  against  him  would  be  one  founded  on  negligence.
Negligence  is  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  Generally,  a
defendant owes a duty of reasonable care to a plaintiff only if his or
her conduct created a risk to that plaintiff that was foreseeable to the
reasonable  person.  Thus,  if  the  reasonable  person  would  not  have
expected  (i.e.,  foreseen)  harm  to  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant  would
have  owed  her  no  duty  of  reasonable  care  and  could  not  be  held
liable  to  her  for  negligence.  Many  jurisdictions  apply  the  “zone  of
danger” rule, which holds that a plaintiff may not recover for mental
suffering  that  he  or  she  experienced  upon  seeing  another  person
sustain  a  physical  injury  unless  he  or  she  was  in  the  same  zone  of
physical  danger  as  the  injured  person.  In  those  jurisdictions,  the
plaintiff  could  not  succeed  against  the  defendant  even  if  the  harm  to
her  was  foreseeable.  A  is  correct,  however,  because  of  all  the
additional facts listed, it is the only one that could possibly result in a
judgment for the plaintiff.

B is incorrect because the doctrine of transferred intent applies only
when the defendant's intent was tortious to begin with. Since the facts
do not indicate that the defendant desired or knew with certainty that
his car would strike the boy, he had no tortious intent. C is incorrect
because there is no rule of tort law that transfers consequences that is
known  as  the  “doctrine  of  transferred  consequences.”  Liability  for
intentionally inflicting emotional distress requires outrageous conduct
by  the  defendant.  This  tort  also  requires  that  the  defendant  intend  to
cause mental suffering or be reckless in creating the risk of emotional
distress,  however.  Since  the  defendant  lacked  such  intent  (while  he
was  speeding,  “reckless”  requires  the  defendant  to  act  in  deliberate
disregard of a high degree of probability that emotional distress will
occur,  and  there  are  no  facts  indicating  this),  he  could  not  be  held
liable  for  intentionally  inflicting  mental  distress  even  if  his  conduct
was outrageous. D is therefore incorrect.

125.  C  Negligence  is  the  breach  of  a  duty  of  reasonable  care.  In  some
jurisdictions, the duty that a landholder owes to a plaintiff who enters
the  land  depends  on  the  plaintiff's  status  as  trespasser,  licensee,  or
invitee.  In  other  jurisdictions,  the  duty  does  not  depend  on  the
plaintiff's  status.  All  jurisdictions  agree,  however,  that  a  defendant
does not owe a plaintiff anything more than reasonable care, no matter
what the plaintiff's status. Since the lawn had recently been mowed,
and  since  the  ladder  was  in  plain  view,  it  probably  was  reasonable

1054

for  the  homeowner  to  believe  that  the  employee  saw  it.  If  so,  the
homeowner's  failure  to  warn  the  employee  about  it  probably  was
reasonable as well, and therefore probably was not negligent. While
it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  the
argument in C  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  support  the
homeowner's defense.

The  fact  that  the  homeowner  did  not  know  with  certainty  that  the
employee would be injured means that he did not intend her injury. A
is  incorrect,  however,  because  negligence  liability  does  not  require
intent or knowledge with certainty that harm will result. B is incorrect
because  a  landholder's  obligation  to  warn  or  protect  others  against
dangerous conditions of his or her land may extend to conditions that
he  or  she  did  not  create.  D  is  an  incorrect  statement  of  the  law;  in
general,  a  government  employee  entering  on  official  business  is  at
least a licensee, entitled to be warned of dangerous conditions known
to the landholder and hidden from the licensee's view.

126.  D  Under  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur,  an  inference  that  the
defendant acted unreasonably can be drawn if the injury involved was
one that does not usually occur without unreasonable conduct and the
defendant was the only person whose conduct could have caused the
injury (i.e., the defendant had exclusive control of the circumstances).
If  an  expert  witness  testifies  that  surgeons  do  not  usually  leave
instruments  inside  a  patient  unless  they  are  acting  unreasonably,  the
patient  can  rely  on  the  inference  established  by  res  ipsa  loquitur  if
she can show that the doctor was the only person who could have left
the instrument inside her. Since the doctor was the only person who
had  ever  performed  surgery  on  the  patient,  the  doctor  is  the  only
person who could have left the instrument inside her.

A is incorrect because it is based on an inaccurate statement of law;
there are many medical malpractice cases in which the plaintiff was
permitted  to  rely  on  res  ipsa  loquitur.  (Note:  These  frequently
involve  foreign  objects  that  were  left  in  the  plaintiff's  body  during
surgery). Ordinarily, in drawing an inference of negligence under the
doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur,  a  jury  relies  on  what  it  knows  about
human experience to determine whether a particular accident is of a
kind  that  does  not  usually  occur  without  negligence.  Because  of  its
lack  of  specialized  knowledge,  a  jury  is  not  competent  to  decide
whether  the  particular  result  of  a  professional's  conduct  is  one  that

1055

would  not  usually  occur  without  negligence.  Once  a  jury  has  heard
testimony to that effect from an expert witness, however, it may base
an  inference  of  negligence  on  its  decision  about  whether  or  not  it
believes  that  witness.  This  is  a  decision  that  a  jury  is  uniquely
competent  to  make.  For  this  reason,  B  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect
because  res  ipsa  loquitur  is  not  dependent  on  the  existence  of  any
“absolute duty,” but rather on circumstantial evidence that justifies the
inference that a particular defendant acted unreasonably.

127.  A  In  an  all-or-nothing  contributory  negligence  jurisdiction,  a  plaintiff
whose own negligence contributed to the accident cannot recover any
damages for injuries that he or she sustained. Under pure comparative
negligence  statutes,  a  plaintiff's  negligence  does  not  bar  his  or  her
recovery, but results in a reduction of damages in proportion to his or
her  own  fault.  Since  the  jury  found  the  pedestrian's  damage  to  be
$100,000  and  found  the  pedestrian  to  be  20  percent  at  fault,  the
pedestrian  is  entitled  to  collect  $100,000  reduced  by  20  percent.
When  two  defendants  are  “jointly  and  severally”  liable  to  the
plaintiff,  the  plaintiff  may  collect  the  entire  amount  of  his  or  her
judgment from either of them (several liability), or may collect it from
both of them in any combination whatsoever (joint liability). Since the
court  found  both  defendants  to  be  jointly  and  severally  liable  to  the
pedestrian, the pedestrian can collect the full amount of his judgment
from the first driver alone.

B is incorrect because of the “collateral source rule,” which provides
that money that a plaintiff receives from parties other than tortfeasors
or  their  representatives  is  irrelevant  in  determining  his  or  her
damages.  For  this  reason,  the  sum  of  $10,000  that  the  pedestrian
received  from  his  own  hospitalization  insurer  plays  no  part  in
determining the amount that he can collect from the defendants. C is
incorrect  because  the  court  found  the  defendants  to  be  jointly  and
severally liable to the pedestrian as explained above. D is incorrect
under the collateral source rule as explained above.

128. D A person is strictly liable for any damages that occur while he or she
is  conducting  an  abnormally  dangerous  activity.  An  activity  is
abnormally dangerous if there is a high degree of risk of some harm to
others, the harm that results is likely to be serious, the risk cannot be
eliminated  by  the  exercise  of  reasonable  care,  the  activity  is  not
common,  the  activity  is  not  appropriate  for  the  place  where  it  is

1056

carried  on,  and  the  danger  outweighs  the  activity's  value  to  the
community. There are some types of activities that are generally held
to be abnormally dangerous, such as the use or storage of explosives,
crop  dusting  or  spraying  with  pesticides,  and  the  operation  of  a
nuclear  reactor.  Here,  since  the  defendant  is  operating  a  nuclear
reactor, it is strictly liable for the harm done to the plaintiff. A and C
are  therefore  incorrect.  Ordinary  contributory  fault  will  not  usually
bar  a  plaintiff  from  recovery  under  strict  liability.  B  is  therefore
incorrect.

129. C Under the “but for” rule of causation, a defendant's conduct is a cause
of a plaintiff's injury if the plaintiff's injury would not have occurred
without it. Since the pedestrian would not have been injured without
the  girl's  intoxication,  and  since  the  girl  would  not  have  become
intoxicated  without  the  second  tavern's  conduct,  the  second  tavern's
conduct was a cause of the pedestrian's injury.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons.  First,  given  the  facts,  it  is  uncertain
whether the first tavern's conduct was a substantial factor in making
the  girl  intoxicated.  Second,  even  if  the  first  tavern's  conduct  was  a
cause  of  the  harm  (i.e.,  a  substantial  factor  in  producing  it),  the
second tavern's conduct was also a cause of that harm. B is incorrect
because the language  of  the  statute  (“.  .  .  any  person  who  sold  said
minor  the  alcohol  which  resulted  in  said  minor's  intoxication  .  .  .”)
indicates  that  liability  depends  on  a  causal  relationship  between  the
defendant's  conduct  and 
the
the  minor's 
pedestrian's  injury  would  not  have  occurred  without  the  girl's
intoxication, any cause of the girl's intoxication must also have been a
cause of the pedestrian's injury. D is therefore incorrect.

intoxication.  Since 

130. C Negligence is unreasonable conduct in the face of a foreseeable risk.
If  the  contractor  acted  reasonably  in  relying  on  the  architect's
instructions, she could not have been negligent.

A  plaintiff  may  be  prevented  from  recovering  for  damages  resulting
from  a  defendant's  negligence  if  the  plaintiff  “assumed  the  risk”  by
voluntarily  encountering  a  risk  of  which  he  or  she  knew.  A  is
incorrect  because  this  concept  applies  only  to  the  conduct  of  a
plaintiff.  B  is  incorrect  because  a  defendant  owes  a  duty  of
reasonable care to all persons who are placed at a foreseeable risk as
a result of that defendant's conduct. Since it was foreseeable that the
landowner would hire a mover to bring furniture into the new house,

1057

the  contractor  thus  owed  the  mover  a  duty  to  act  reasonably  in
building the house and could be liable to the mover for breaching it.
D is incorrect because a ritualistic protest is not sufficient to absolve
a person of liability for the results of his or her conduct if that conduct
is unreasonable.

131. C The manufacturer of a product is strictly liable for damage that results
from a defect in the product that existed at the time the manufacturer
placed that product in the stream of commerce. In this connection, a
product is defective if its condition would defeat the expectations of
the  reasonable  consumer.  Since  a  reasonable  consumer  would  not
expect liquor to contain poison, the liquor was defective. Since that
defect  existed  when  the  liquor  left  the  factory,  the  factory  is  strictly
liable for the pedestrian's injuries.

A  is  incorrect  because  strict  liability  is  imposed  regardless  of  the
reason  for  the  existence  of  the  defect.  B  is  incorrect  because  strict
liability  is  applied  for  the  benefit  of  any  foreseeable  plaintiff
regardless  of  whether  he  or  she  was  a  purchaser,  consumer,  or
bystander. D is incorrect because strict liability (i.e., liability without
fault) does not depend on the defendant's unreasonable conduct.

132. A  Strict  liability  (i.e.,  liability  without  fault)  may  be  imposed  on  one
who engages in an abnormally dangerous activity. In this connection,
an activity is sufficiently dangerous to result in strict liability if it is
not a common activity and necessarily involves a serious risk of harm
that cannot be eliminated by reasonable care. While it is not certain
that a court would come to this conclusion, A is the only option that
could possibly be correct.

Although the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur may permit an inference of
negligence  to  be  drawn  from  circumstantial  evidence,  it  does  not
impose  negligence  liability  on  a  defendant  who  was  not  negligent.
Since  the  facts  indicate  that  the  rocket  company  acted  reasonably,
negligence liability should not be imposed. B  is  therefore  incorrect.
Although  tort  liability  is  sometimes  limited  by  the  concept  of
foreseeability,  the  amount  of  damage  need  not  be  specifically
foreseeable  so  long  as  the  type  of  damage  is  foreseeable.  C  is
therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  a  type  of  harm  may  be
foreseeable  even  though  it  never  happened  before  (e.g.,  it  is
foreseeable  that  a  person  will  die  even  though  he  or  she  has  never
died before). The fact that no such damage had ever occurred in the

1058

past is therefore not sufficient to make that damage unforeseeable.

133. C A manufacturer is strictly liable for injuries that result from a defect
in its product if the defect existed when the manufacturer placed the
product in the stream of commerce. The company will thus be strictly
liable  if  the  absence  of  an  acceleration  suppressor  was  a  defect.  A
defect  is  a  condition  that  would  defeat  the  expectations  of  the
reasonable  consumer.  Unless  the  belt  truck  is  equipped  with  an
acceleration  suppressor,  it  will  lurch  forward  if  the  belt  idle  is
adjusted  improperly.  The  reasonable  consumer  probably  does  not
expect  a  vehicle  to  lurch  forward  when  it  is  being  used  for  its
intended purpose. Since persons who maintain belt trucks frequently
adjust the belt idle improperly, belt trucks will frequently lurch in the
absence  of  an  acceleration  suppressor.  Its  absence,  therefore,  is
probably a defect.

those  subsequent  acts  (i.e., 

The absence of an acceleration suppressor was a factual cause of the
employee's injury because the employee would not have been injured
if the truck had been equipped with one. The fact that the injury would
not  have  occurred  without  the  subsequent  acts  of  others  (i.e.,
intervening causes) would not prevent the company from being liable
intervening  causes)  were
unless 
unforeseeable (i.e., superseding causes). Since humans are frequently
negligent,  the  unreasonable  conduct  of  the  first  airline  and  the
contractor may have been foreseeable. For this reason, A and B are
incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  it  is  based  on  an  inaccurate
statement.  Sometimes  the  relationship  between  two  persons  makes
one of them responsible for conduct of the other (i.e., conduct of one
is  imputed  to  the  other).  There  is  no  relationship  between  the
contractor  and  the  company  that  would  result  in  such  an  imputation,
however.

134. D Private nuisance involves a tortious invasion of the plaintiff's right to
use  and  enjoy  realty.  Although  the  fumes  invaded  the  homeowner's
right  to  use  and  enjoy  his  realty,  their  emission  was  not  a  nuisance
unless it resulted from liability-forming (i.e., tortious) conduct by the
company.  Since  the  homeowner  has  alleged  that  the  company's
conduct  was  liability-forming  in  that  it  was  negligent,  liability  will
depend  on  whether  the  company's  conduct  was  unreasonable  (i.e.,
is
negligent).  Ordinarily, 
unreasonable,  it  is  necessary  to  weigh  the  risks  resulting  from  such
conduct  against  the  burdens  of  eliminating  those  risks.  Additionally,

in  determining  whether  conduct 

1059

courts  will  weigh  the  social  value  and  utility  of  the  defendant's
activity  against  the  harm  done  to  the  plaintiff.  Here,  the  company  is
making an insecticide that is very important to the state's orange crop,
and the plaintiff is having the paint on his home damaged. If the cost
(i.e.,  the  burden)  of  eliminating  the  fumes  would  drive  the  company
out  of  business,  a  court  might  find  that  the  burden  was  so  much
heavier  than  the  risk  that  it  would  eliminate  that  it  was  not
unreasonable for the company to continue emitting the fumes, and that
the company, therefore, was not negligent. While it is not certain that
a court would come to this conclusion, D is the only argument listed
that could possibly provide the company with an effective defense.

A  is  incorrect  because  nuisance  requires  an  invasion  of  plaintiff's
rights in realty, but it does not require a physical invasion of the realty
itself. For an individual to prevail in a claim for public nuisance, he
or  she  must  show  that  the  harm  that  he  or  she  sustained  was
substantially different from that sustained by the general public. B is
incorrect,  however,  because  no  such  showing  is  required  in  a  claim
for private nuisance. If the homeowner's claim were based on intent,
it would be necessary for him to show that the company knew that its
activity  was  interfering  with  his  right.  Since  his  claim  is  based  on
negligence,  however,  it  is  sufficient  for  him  to  show  that  such
interference was foreseeable. C is therefore incorrect.

135. C Strict liability in tort is imposed, regardless of fault, on a professional
supplier who sells a product while it is in a defective condition. If a
product  is  more  dangerous  than  would  be  contemplated  by  the
ordinary  consumer,  the  product  is  defectively  dangerous.  If  the
ordinary consumer would not have expected the product to irritate the
scalp  of  a  person  with  the  plaintiff's  allergy,  then  the  product's
condition  would  defeat  the  reasonable  expectation  of  the  ordinary
consumer and was defective.

Under  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur,  an  inference  of  negligence
can be drawn from the fact that a particular kind of accident does not
usually  occur  without  negligence.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because
the plaintiff's theory is strict liability in tort, and since strict liability
is imposed without regard to fault, an inference that the defendant was
negligent is not relevant to it. The facts in B and D would suggest that
the company knew or should have known about the plaintiff's allergy.
This  knowledge  is  not  sufficient,  however,  to  establish  that  the

1060

product's  condition  would  have  defeated  the  reasonable  expectation
of  the  ordinary  consumer  (i.e.,  that  the  product  was  defective).  For
this reason, B and D are incorrect.

136. D Negligence can be based on an unreasonable omission, so long as the
potentially negligent party had a duty to act. Generally, a person has a
duty to act only when his or her conduct causes a need for such action.
This can happen when a person's conduct causes a plaintiff to fail to
protect himself or herself against already existing risks because he or
she  reasonably  believes  that  the  person  would  protect  him  or  her.
Consequently,  since  the  defendant's  past  conduct  had  caused  the
plaintiff  to  reasonably  believe  there  would  be  no  leaves  on  the
sidewalk,  the  defendant  could  be  found  negligent  under  these
circumstances.  This  would  be  so  whether  or  not  the  danger  was
created by the defendant or located on his or her property. Therefore,
A and C are incorrect. B is incorrect because the plaintiff's potential
negligence would not necessarily insulate the defendant from liability.

137. A Res ipsa loquitur permits an inference of unreasonable conduct to be
drawn  where  the  accident  is  one  that  would  not  ordinarily  have
occurred  without  negligence,  and  the  defendant  was  in  exclusive
control of the circumstances that produced the harm. Since the bread
company  was  in  exclusive  control  of  the  baking  process,  res  ipsa
loquitur  would  apply  if  reasonable  care  in  baking  would  ordinarily
have eliminated the slivers (i.e., if the accident would not ordinarily
have occurred without negligence).

B  is  incorrect  because  liability  for  negligence  (which  is  the  only
theory  to  which  res  ipsa  loquitur  applies)  does  not  depend  on
whether a product is defective. The customer's harm  was  caused  by
the presence of the metal slivers in the bread. C is incorrect because
even if the farmer's negligence caused the slivers to be in the wheat,
the bread company may be liable for the harm if its negligence caused
them to be in the bread. If reasonable care would have prevented the
slivers from getting in the bread, it does not matter how they got into
the  wheat.  Thus,  even  if  the  breaking  of  the  farmer's  blade  was
unforeseeable, the bread company might be liable to the customer for
its  negligence  in  failing  to  keep  the  slivers  out  of  the  bread.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

138. C A defendant is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress if,
with  the  intent  to  cause  mental  distress,  he  or  she  engages  in

1061

outrageous conduct that causes severe mental distress. The defendant
intends  the  plaintiff's  mental  distress  if  he  or  she  desires  or  knows
that  it  will  result  from  his  or  her  conduct.  Because  of  the  affection
normally  associated  with  the  mother-daughter  relationship,  the
kidnapper probably intended that his threats to injure or kill the girl
would cause her mother to experience mental distress. If his conduct
was  outrageous  and  caused  her  to  experience  mental  distress,  the
kidnapper  is  liable  to  her  for  the  mental  distress  and  any  physical
manifestations of it.

A is incorrect because the passage of time is not sufficient to prevent
liability  for  an  injury  that  was  caused  by  the  defendant's  tortious
conduct.  If  the  reasonable  person  would  not  have  experienced  any
suffering  as  a  result  of  the  kidnapper's  conduct,  then  a  plaintiff  who
did  experience  suffering  might  not  be  permitted  to  recover  for  it
because the law does not seek to benefit a supersensitive plaintiff. If
the  reasonable  person  would  have  experienced  some  suffering,
however,  a  plaintiff  will  be  permitted  to  recover  for  his  or  her
suffering even if a preexisting condition makes it unusually severe. B
is therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because liability for intentional
infliction of mental distress requires intent, not merely a foreseeable
risk.

139.  C  Assumption  of  the  risk  is  a  defense  in  all  approaches  to  products
liability (although some jurisdictions have merged it with the concept
of  comparative  fault),  and  it  occurs  when  the  plaintiff  voluntarily
encounters a known risk. If the plaintiff knew that the paper suit was
likely  to  dissolve  when  wet  and  wore  it  anyway,  she  voluntarily
encountered (and therefore assumed) a known risk.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  department  store  may  be  held  liable
without fault for selling a defective product. B is incorrect because a
sign like the one described is not sufficient to apprise the buyer that
the product is being sold without any warranty of merchantability or
to prevent the reasonable consumer from expecting the bathing suit to
hold  together  when  wet.  Although  a  product  retailer  who  is  held
liable for selling a defective product has a right to be indemnified by
the product's manufacturer, the right of the injured plaintiff to recover
does not depend on this right of the retailer. D is therefore incorrect.

140.  B  Normally,  a  minor  child  is  held  to  the  same  standard  of  care  as  a
reasonable  child  of  similar  “age,  intelligence,  and  experience.”

1062

However, if the child engages in an adult activity, the child is held to
an adult standard of care. An adult activity is one normally undertaken
only  by  adults  and  for  which  adult  qualifications  are  required.
Driving a motorcycle is such an activity (usually, it requires a license
and has age restrictions). Consequently, the boy would be held to an
adult standard of care. According to the question, a reasonable adult
would have known to slow down, so the boy is liable for not adhering
to that standard.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  boy  is  not  automatically  liable  for  the
simple fact he is driving a motorcycle. C is incorrect because it states
the  wrong  standard  of  care.  D  is  incorrect  because  following  the
posted speed limit would not necessarily absolve him from liability.

141. B Negligence is a failure to act reasonably. Thus, if it was unreasonable
for the dog trainer to work the dog in her front yard, her conduct was
negligent  and  could  result  in  liability.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  a
court would come to this conclusion, the argument in B is the only one
listed that could possibly support the walker's claim.

Strict liability for damage resulting from a product defect is imposed
only  against  a  professional  supplier  who  placed  the  product  in  the
stream of commerce. Since the dog trainer was a user of the device
rather  than  a  supplier  of  it,  A  is  incorrect.  Conduct  that  causes
damage  can  result  in  tort  liability  only  if  the  damage  was  intended,
resulted from negligence, or resulted from an activity for which strict
liability  is  imposed.  Without  establishing  one  of  these  bases  of
liability, calling the dog trainer's conduct a cause of harm would not
be sufficient to result in liability. For this reason, the argument in C is
incomplete,  making  C  incorrect.  Although  some  special  standard  of
care might be imposed because of the dog trainer's profession, D  is
incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  that  the  standard  was
breached.

142.  D  Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  product  that  is  in  a
defective  condition  when  sold.  If  the  presence  of  the  toxic  material
was a defect, the company would be strictly liable.

A is incorrect because strict liability is imposed regardless of fault or
knowledge by the defendant. Although the classification of a product
as  “inherently  dangerous”  was  significant  during  a  certain  historical
period  in  the  development  of  the  law  of  torts,  this  is  no  longer  the

1063

case. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because strict liability in
tort does not depend on the reasonableness of the defendant's conduct.

143.  A  A  person  whose  conduct  is  negligent  is  liable  for  damage  that  is
proximately caused by that negligence. Conduct is a proximate cause
of harm if it is a factual and legal cause of that harm. Thus, because
the  driver's  negligence  was  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  the
pedestrian's broken leg, the driver is liable for it.

B is incorrect because there was no relationship between the driver
and  the  taxi  that  would  result  in  such  an  imputation.  C  is  an
impossibility since nothing can be regarded as a legal cause of harm
unless  it  was  a  factual  cause  of  that  harm.  The  reasoning  of  D
establishes that the taxi's conduct was a cause of harm, but it does not
establish  that  the  other  driver's  conduct  was  not.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

144. D A statement is defamatory if it would tend to hold the plaintiff up to
shame,  disgrace,  or  ridicule  in  the  minds  of  a  substantial  group  of
respectable people. Since most respectable people believe that theft
is  disgraceful,  an  accusation  that  the  plaintiff  is  a  thief  is  probably
defamatory.

Because  the  employee  did  not  return  the  tools,  the  employer's
statement  is  literally  true.  However,  the  literal  truth  of  the  statement
would not prevent the employer from being liable since there is some
dispute as to whether the employee was justified in taking the tools. A
is  therefore  incorrect.  A  defendant  may  be  privileged  to  make
defamatory  statements  in  a  reasonable  and  good  faith  attempt  to
protect  a  legitimate  interest.  In  deciding  whether  a  former  employer
was  acting  in  good  faith  when  making  a  defamatory  statement  to  a
plaintiff's prospective employer, courts frequently look to whether the
former employer made the statement gratuitously (making it less likely
that he or she was acting in good faith) or in response to a request for
information (making it more likely that he or she was acting in good
faith). B is incorrect, however, because this fact alone is not sufficient
to  privilege  a  defendant's  publication.  C  is  incorrect  because  if  the
defendant was acting reasonably and in good faith, the interest that a
former  employer  has  in  common  with  a  prospective  employer  might
be sufficiently legitimate to make the privilege apply.

145.  C  While  a  defendant  can  be  held  strictly  liable  for  carrying  on  an

1064

abnormally  dangerous  activity  such  as  transporting  high  explosives,
the  defendant  is  only  strictly  liable  for  damage  that  results  from  the
kind  of  risk  that  made  the  activity  abnormally  dangerous.  While
transporting  high  explosives  may  be  abnormally  dangerous,  the
plaintiff's  injuries  did  not  result  from  the  kind  of  risk  that  made  this
activity  abnormally  dangerous  (namely  explosions).  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  assumption  of  the  risk  involves
situations where the plaintiff has voluntarily consented to take his or
her  chances  that  a  harm  will  occur.  This  usually  involves  situations
where the plaintiff is engaging in some type of activity, such as going
to a baseball game, bungee jumping, skiing, etc. Here, the plaintiff's
actions  were  more  correctly  categorized  as  contributory  negligence.
Importantly,  in  a  jurisdiction  that  follows  comparative  negligence
principles,  this  negligence  will  not  completely  bar  the  plaintiff's
recovery.  It  will  only  lessen  the  amount  recovered.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

146. D Negligence is the failure to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable
risk  created  by  the  defendant's  conduct.  Since  it  probably  was
foreseeable  that  the  used  car  dealer  would  show  a  customer  the  car
after  buying  it  for  resale,  the  seller  owed  such  customers  a  duty  of
reasonable care that probably was breached by his failure to disclose
the  crack.  Although  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this
conclusion, D is the only argument listed that could possibly lead to
recovery by the customer.

Battery  is  committed  by  intentionally  causing  a  harmful  or  offensive
contact  with  the  plaintiff.  In  a  battery  case,  intent  means  a  desire  or
knowledge  that  there  will  be  harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  the
plaintiff  or  that  the  plaintiff  will  become  apprehensive  of  such
contact. Although the seller knew that the engine was cracked, there is
no  indication  that  he  desired  or  knew  that  the  crack  would  result  in
harmful or offensive contact with any person, or that it would cause
apprehension  of  such  contact.  Although  these  risks  may  have  been
foreseeable,  battery  liability  cannot  be  imposed  without  intent.  For
this  reason,  A  is  incorrect.  Misrepresentation  liability  is  imposed
only  for  the  benefit  of  a  plaintiff  who  justifiably  relied  on  the
defendant's  false  representation.  Since  the  customer  did  not  rely  on
any  express  or  implied  statement  made  by  the  seller,  B  and  C  are
incorrect.

1065

147.  A  When  a  defendant  negligently  causes  physical  injury  or  property
damage to one party, but only pure economic loss to the plaintiff, the
traditional rule is that the plaintiff may not recover anything. This is
because  a  defendant  could  have  open-ended  liability  (for  example,
the restaurant's suppliers could sue, other waiters, etc.). Some courts
recognize  case-by-case  exceptions  to  this  rule,  but  only  in  cases
where the injury to the plaintiff was relatively foreseeable, relatively
few plaintiffs would be permitted to sue, and the defendant's conduct
was  relatively  blameworthy.  As  stated  above,  if  plaintiffs  are
allowed  to  sue  for  pure  economic  loss  in  this  case,  there  is  a
potentially  limitless  number  of  plaintiffs.  C  and  D  are  therefore
incorrect.  Because  the  defendant  would  be  liable  in  certain
exceptional cases, B is incorrect.

148.  B  A  private  individual  can  successfully  assert  a  claim  for  public
nuisance only if the harm that he or she sustained was different from
that sustained by the general public (i.e., “particular” harm). Since no
fact  indicates  this  to  be  so  of  the  resident,  she  may  not  assert  the
public nuisance claim.

A is incorrect because if the resident had sustained “particular” harm,
the decision of the city attorney would not prevent her from suing for
damages. Although it is generally held that a private individual may
not  seek  an  injunction  on  a  public  nuisance  theory,  C  is  incorrect
because  there  are  other  theories  on  which  a  private  individual  may
receive an injunction against environmental polluters. D is incorrect
because a private individual who sustains particular harm as result of
a public nuisance may sue for damages.

149.  D  It  is  given  that  the  doctor's  conduct  was  negligent.  Even  if  a
defendant's  conduct  was  negligent,  however,  the  defendant  is  not
liable for the plaintiff's injuries unless they were proximately caused
by  that  conduct.  Conduct  is  a  proximate  cause  of  an  injury  if  it  is  a
factual  and  legal  cause  of  the  injury.  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of
injury  if  the  injury  would  not  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  the
trucker would not have been in the hospital and injured by the falling
of the hospital structure except for the doctor's conduct, the doctor's
conduct was a factual cause of the trucker's injury. If conduct was a
factual  cause  of  harm,  it  was  a  legal  cause  of  that  harm  if  the  harm
was  foreseeable  and  not  brought  about  by  superseding  causes.  A
is
superseding  cause  of  harm 

intervening  cause 

is  an 

that 

1066

unforeseeable  or  independent  of  the  risks  created  by  the  defendant's
conduct. Thus, because the earthquake was a superseding cause of the
trucker's  fractured  skull,  it  prevented  the  doctor's  negligence  from
being a legal or proximate cause of the fractured skull.

A  establishes  that  the  doctor's  conduct  was  a  factual  cause  of  the
fractured  skull,  but  it  is  incorrect  because  it  does  not  deal  with  the
problem of legal cause. The doctor's conduct was not a legal cause of
the fractured skull unless the fractured skull was a foreseeable result
of  it.  The  fact  that  the  wait  might  have  been  foreseeable  does  not
make  the  fractured  skull  foreseeable.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C
establishes that the presence of the cherry pit was a factual cause of
the trucker's injury, but it does not establish that the doctor's conduct
was not also a cause of it. C is therefore incorrect.

150. D The statute given is typical of the “modified” comparative negligence
approach. A deduction is made from the plaintiff's recovery based on
the percentage of fault which was the plaintiff's. But if the plaintiff's
fault exceeds the defendant's, the plaintiff receives nothing. Since the
jury  found  the  plaintiff  to  be  60  percent  at  fault,  he  can  recover
nothing. A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

151. C Even if a defendant's conduct is negligent, the defendant is not liable
for the plaintiff's injuries unless they were proximately caused by that
conduct. Conduct is a proximate cause of harm if it was a factual and
legal cause of the harm. Conduct is a factual cause of harm if the harm
would not have occurred without it. Since the client would not have
been hurt if the landlord had fixed or warned him about the elevator,
the  landlord's  failure  to  do  so  was  a  factual  cause  of  the  client's
injuries. Conduct that is a factual cause of harm is a legal cause if the
harm  was  a  foreseeable  result  of  it  and  not  brought  about  by  an
unforeseeable intervening cause (i.e., a superseding cause). Since the
client would not have been hurt if the attorney had not permitted him
to  use  the  elevator,  the  attorney's  conduct  was  also  a  cause  of  the
client's injury. Thus, if it was not foreseeable that the attorney would
permit  the  client  to  use  the  elevator,  the  attorney's  conduct  was  a
superseding cause of the client's injury. While it is not certain that a
court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  C  is  the  only  argument  listed
that could possibly support the landlord's defense.

Although  the  landlord's  promise  to  repair  the  elevator  might  not  be
enforceable  by  the  client,  A  is  not  an  effective  argument  because,

1067

apart  from  the  promise,  one  who  holds  realty  owes  a  duty  of
reasonable  care  to  invitees.  An  invitee  is  a  person  whose  presence
confers  an  economic  benefit  on  the  landholder.  The  client  was  the
attorney's client, and the attorney would not have rented space in the
building  unless  his  clients  could  come  to  see  him  there.  For  this
reason,  the  client's  presence  did  confer  an  economic  benefit  on  the
landlord, and the client was the landlord's invitee. (Note: It is usually
held that invitees of a tenant are also invitees of the landlord.) B  is
therefore incorrect. Although an unforeseeable intervening cause may
be  superseding  (i.e.,  prevent  the  antecedent  wrongdoer  from  being
liable), the fact that it was unreasonable is not sufficient to make it
superseding. D is therefore incorrect.

152. A If the harm to the daughter was foreseeable, then the exterminator had
a duty to act reasonably in the face of it. His failure to do so would
constitute  negligence,  for  which  he  may  be  liable  to  the  daughter.
Although a court might not come to this conclusion, the argument in A
is the only one listed that could possibly support the daughter's claim.

Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  seller  of  a  defective  product,  but
since  the  store  owner  did  not  sell  the  pellets  to  the  janitor,  B  is
incorrect.  Courts  impose  a  duty  to  act  reasonably  in  designing  or
producing  a  product  on  the  manufacturers  of  all  products.  For  this
reason, the question of whether a product is inherently dangerous is of
no  importance,  and  C  is  incorrect.  Unless  the  exterminator  was
negligent,  questions  of  causation  are  irrelevant.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

153. A Consent (i.e., willingness) is a defense to all intentional torts. While
it is not likely that this inference would be drawn, it would give the
girlfriend a complete privilege if it was.

B is incorrect because the plaintiff has a right to elect whether to sue
for  conversion  or  trespass  to  chattel.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
neighbor's liability would not prevent the girlfriend from being liable
as  well.  The  remedy  for  trespass  to  chattel  is  money  damages.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

154.  D  Negligence  means  failing  to  act  like  the  reasonable  person.  If  the
defendant  can  convince  the  trier  of  fact  that  the  reasonable  person
occasionally takes his or her eyes off the road while driving, and that
his  conduct  was  therefore  not  negligent,  the  plaintiff's  negligence

1068

action  against  him  will  fail.  While  a  court  might  not  come  to  this
conclusion, D is the only argument listed that might be effective in the
defendant's defense.

A  is  incorrect  because  assumption  of  the  risk  requires  a  voluntary
encounter  with  a  known  risk.  For  this  purpose,  a  risk  is  “known”  if
the  plaintiff  is  substantially  certain  that  harm  will  probably  occur.
Recognition  of  a  mere  possibility  of  harm  is  not  sufficient.  B  is
incorrect  because  although  it  establishes  that  the  other  car's  sudden
stop  was  a  cause  of  the  accident,  that  does  not  mean  that  the
defendant's  conduct  was  not  also  a  cause.  C  is  incorrect  since  the
special rules about duties owed to licensees apply only to accidents
that occur on a defendant's land.

155. A It was probably unreasonable for the fire chief (who knew the device
could  be  dangerous)  to  permit  the  volunteer  firefighter  (whom  he
knew to be untrained) to use it. Although a court might not find that the
fire chief was negligent, A is the only theory listed that could result in
a judgment for the woman.

Unless  the  fire  chief  had  a  substantial  certainty  that  harm  would
result,  he  lacked  the  intent  to  make  him  liable  for  battery.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  Strict  products  liability  is  imposed  only  on  a
professional supplier of a defective product. Since the fire chief was
not  in  the  business  of  supplying  the  device,  C  is  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  res ipsa  permits  an  inference  of  negligence  to  be
drawn from the circumstances only when there is no direct evidence
of the defendant's conduct.

156. C A defendant is liable for damage that was proximately caused by his
or her negligence. A defendant's conduct is a proximate cause of harm
if  it  is  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  that  harm.  Conduct  is  a  factual
cause of harm if the harm would not have occurred without it. Since
the  plaintiff  would  not  have  sustained  any  injuries  at  all  were  it  not
for  her  neighbor's  negligence,  her  neighbor's  negligence  is  a  factual
cause of all her injuries. Conduct that is a factual cause of harm is a
legal cause of that harm if the harm was foreseeable and not brought
about  by  unforeseeable  or  independent  interventions.  Courts  usually
hold that in treating injuries inflicted by a defendant, the malpractice
of a physician is neither unforeseeable nor independent of the conduct
that  caused  the  initial  injuries.  For  this  reason,  all  complications
caused by the malpractice of the doctors were proximately caused by

1069

the  neighbor,  making  the  neighbor  liable  for  them.  C  is  therefore
correct. (Note: The negligent doctors may also be held liable as joint
tortfeasors.)

157. D  A  statement  is  defamatory  if  it  would  expose  the  plaintiff  to  hatred,
contempt,  disgrace,  or  ridicule.  Here,  if  many  people  continue  to
believe that members of the group engage in improper activities, the
statement would do so.

A is incorrect since a judgment for the minister will not violate either
the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause. B is incorrect
because  what  matters  is  what  a  substantial  group  of  people  would
believe about the plaintiff as a result of the statement. The fact that a
substantial  group  of  right-thinking  people  would  not  associate  the
plaintiff with shame or disgrace does not prevent the statement from
being  defamatory  if  there  is  also  a  substantial  group  of  people  who
would. C is therefore incorrect.

158. D Negligence is the failure to act reasonably in the face of a foreseeable
risk.  If  the  risk  was  not  foreseeable,  the  company's  failure  to  guard
against it was not negligence.

A is incorrect since an expert is expected to know only that which the
reasonable  expert  would  know.  If  the  risk  that  it  will  wear  out  was
not foreseeable, knowledge that harm would occur if it did wear out
does  not  result  in  a  duty  to  protect  against  its  wearing  out.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  employee's  action  is
based on negligence.

159. A  Negligence  is  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  Most  cases
hold that a defendant does not owe a duty of reasonable care unless it
is foreseeable (i.e., the reasonable person would anticipate) that his
or her act will cause harm. If it was reasonable for the carpenter to
believe  that  his  act  would  cause  no  harm,  he  owed  no  duty  of
reasonable care. If the carpenter owed no duty of reasonable care, the
carpenter could not have been negligent.

B  is  incorrect  because  custom  does  not  determine  what  reasonable
care is. Although the man's contributory negligence might prevent him
from recovering, there is no indication that the man's failure to see the
hammer  was  negligent.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because  of  the  rule  that  a  defendant  takes  the  plaintiff  as  he  or  she
finds  him  or  her.  (Note:  What  this  means  is  that  if  an  injury  to  the

1070

plaintiff  is  foreseeable,  the  full  extent  of  that  injury  is  foreseeable
even  though  some  special  sensitivity  of  the  plaintiff  was  a
contributing factor to its extent.)

160. C Negligence consists of a failure to act reasonably. Since the question
specifies  an  action  for  negligence,  the  man  cannot  win  without
establishing  that  the  grocery  store  was  negligent  (i.e.,  acted
unreasonably).

A is incorrect because it is based on an inaccurate statement of law:
The  negligence  of  a  manufacturer  is  not  ordinarily  imputed  to  a
retailer selling products made by that manufacturer, although a retailer
may  be  held  strictly  liable  for  damages  resulting  from  a  defect  that
existed  when  the  product  was  sold  by  that  retailer.  B  is  incorrect
because  negligence  liability  is  not  imposed  unless  the  defendant
acted  unreasonably.  D  is  incorrect  because  it  is  based  on  an
inaccurate  statement  of  law;  a  retailer  owes  its  customers  a  duty  of
acting  reasonably,  which,  depending  on  the  circumstances,  may
require the inspection of products packaged in sealed containers.

161. C  Negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct.  Thus,  if  the  driver  was  acting
unreasonably,  he  was  negligent  and  should  be  liable  for  the  boy's
injuries.  Under  the  all-or-nothing  rule  of  contributory  negligence,
however, a plaintiff is completely barred from recovery if his or her
own  negligence  contributed  to  the  happening  of  the  accident.
Contributory negligence is unreasonable conduct by a plaintiff. Thus,
if  the  boy's  injury  resulted  from  his  own  unreasonable  conduct  (i.e.,
contributory negligence), he will not recover in spite of the fact that
the driver was also negligent.

A  child  is  said  to  have  been  negligent  if  he  failed  to  act  like  a
reasonable child of the same age, experience, and intelligence. A  is
therefore  incorrect.  Res  ipsa  loquitur  permits  an  inference  that  the
defendant  was  negligent  to  be  drawn  from  certain  circumstantial
evidence. Since the driver's negligence is given, res ipsa loquitur is
inapplicable,  and  B  is  incorrect.  Unreasonable  conduct  by  a  third
person  is  not  imputed  to  a  plaintiff  as  contributory  negligence,  even
when  the  third  person  is  the  minor  plaintiff's  parent.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

162. B A defendant's conduct is a proximate cause of harm if it was a factual
and legal cause of that harm. Conduct is a factual cause of harm if the

1071

harm would not have occurred without it. Since the woman would not
have been injured by the bottle if the grocery store had not restacked
and sold the bottles, the grocery store's conduct was a factual cause of
the woman's injury. Conduct that is a factual cause of harm is a legal
cause of that harm if the harm was a foreseeable result of it. Since the
contents  of  bottles  of  soda-pop  are  under  pressure,  it  is  probably
foreseeable that a crack in the bottle will result in an explosion and
injury. The grocery store's conduct was thus a proximate cause of the
woman's injury. A defendant is liable for the proximate results of his
or  her  negligence.  For  this  reason,  since  the  grocery  store's  conduct
was negligent, the woman is likely to win her lawsuit against it.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff's  helplessness  is  not  in  itself  a
basis  of  the  defendant's  liability.  C  is  incorrect  because  harm  may
have more than one proximate cause. The fact that the conduct of the
officers was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm does not mean
that the negligence of the grocery store was not. Since privity is not an
essential element of a negligence action, D is also incorrect.

163. D Since the buyer received something for his money, the measure of his
damages  must  consider  the  value  that  he  has  received.  In  some
jurisdictions,  damage  for  misrepresentation  is  measured  by  the
difference between what the plaintiff received and what the defendant
told him or her he or she would be receiving (“benefit of the bargain”
theory). In this case, that would be $250,000 less $600, or $249,400.
In  other  jurisdictions,  the  damage  is  measured  by  the  difference
between what the plaintiff paid and what he or she actually received
(“out-of-pocket”  theory).  In  this  case,  that  would  be  $225,000  less
$600 or $224,400. D is therefore correct.

A and C are incorrect because they ignore the value of what the buyer
actually  received.  B  is  incorrect  because  it  describes  a  rescission
remedy, which may be available in a claim for breach of contract but
is not available in this tort claim for damages.

164. A  If  the  likelihood  of  injury  is  great,  a  defendant  may  be  required  to
anticipate the negligence of others. Here, a reasonable person would
not  have  lent  the  car  to  the  friend,  considering  the  fact  he  had  his
license revoked for reckless driving.

B is incorrect because the man's liability in this instance is based on
his loan of the car, not his ownership of it. C is incorrect because the

1072

man was negligent when he lent the car to his friend, so the fact the
friend lied to him about his intentions does not change the analysis. D
is  incorrect  because  the  woman's  motivation  for  suing  the  man  does
not affect the man's liability for negligence.

165. A  The  term  merchantable  means  “fit  for  ordinary  use.”  Proof  that  the
plaintiff's  allergic  reaction  was  the  only  one  that  ever  occurred
indicates  that  it  was  an  unusual  one.  If  the  plaintiff's  allergy  was
unusual enough to be regarded as extraordinary, the product may have
been fit for ordinary use (i.e., by ordinary persons) although unfit for
use by the plaintiff. While a court might not come to this conclusion,
A  is  the  only  fact  listed  that  could  possibly  support  the  defendant's
defense.

Most  jurisdictions  hold  all  members  of  the  chain  of  commercial
product distribution liable for a condition of the product that breaches
the  implied  warranty  of  merchantability.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.
Although  reasonable  inspection  may  have  revealed  that  the  product
was  safe  for  persons  with  “normal”  skin,  C  is  incorrect  for  two
reasons.  First,  warranty  liability  does  not  depend  on  unreasonable
conduct  by  the  defendant,  and  second,  ordinary  use  may  include  use
by  persons  with  skin  that  is  not  normal.  D  is  incorrect  because
government  approval  or  compliance  with  government  requirements
does not prevent common law liability.

166. C For the violation of a statute to constitute negligence per se, the type
of harm that occurred must be the type of harm the statute intended to
protect against. Here, the purpose of the statute was to protect people
from  falling  debris,  not  poisoning,  so  the  construction  company's
violation of it would not constitute negligence per se in this instance.
Therefore, A is incorrect.

B  and  D  are  incorrect  because  issues  of  control  or  the  child's
negligence would not change the initial negligence per se analysis.

167.  D  Defamation  is  a  tort  that  protects  a  person's  interest  in  their
reputation.  It  is  split  into  two  sub-torts,  libel  and  slander.  Libel
consists  mainly  of  all  written  and  printed  matter,  while  slander
involves  oral  statements.  To  establish  a  prima  facie  case  for  either
libel  or  slander,  the  plaintiff  must  prove  there  was  a  false  and
defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff, a communication of that
statement to some person other than the plaintiff, fault on the part of

1073

the  defendant,  and  either  special  harm  or  other  actionability.
Importantly,  the  communication  of  the  statement  has  to  be  either
intentional  or  negligent.  There  is  no  strict  liability.  Here,  since  the
defendant was not negligent in making the statement and did not intend
for others to hear it, he is not liable for either form of defamation. A,
B, and C are therefore incorrect.

168. B Under the given “pure comparative negligence” statute, the plaintiff's
damage should be diminished by 20 percent, since 20 percent of his
injury resulted from his own negligence. Under the collateral source
rule,  applied  in  most  jurisdictions,  money  that  the  plaintiff  has
received from collateral sources (i.e., those other than tortfeasors) is
not relevant to his or her rights against tortfeasors who caused his or
her injury. The insurance money that the plaintiff received was from a
collateral  source  and  should  therefore  not  play  any  role  in
determining the damages.

A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

169.  D  Contributory  negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct  by  the  plaintiff
without  which  his  or  her  injury  would  not  have  occurred.  Since  the
man would not have been injured if he had not accepted a ride from
his neighbor, and since doing so was obviously unreasonable, the man
was contributorily negligent. Assumption of the risk occurs when the
plaintiff voluntarily encounters a known risk. Since the man knew that
his  neighbor  was  drunk  and  voluntarily  rode  with  him,  the  man
assumed all the risks that normally accompany riding in a car driven
by a person who is drunk. Both of these would be effective arguments
in the neighbor's defense.

170. A Tortious appropriation of identity is committed by making commercial
use  of  the  plaintiff's  name,  likeness,  or  identity  without  his  or  her
permission.  It  has  been  repeatedly  held,  however,  that  newsworthy
publications about the plaintiff do not constitute commercial use and
therefore cannot result in liability for this tort. It has also been held
that information may be regarded as “newsworthy” for this purpose,
even though the group to which it is of interest is a limited one.

Since the use of a non-celebrity's identity might be put to commercial
gain (e.g.,  the  photograph  of  an  unknown  but  muscular  person  in  an
advertisement  for  exercise  equipment),  it  is  not  necessary  that  the
plaintiff be a public figure. Many of the cases imposing liability for
this  tort  have  involved  plaintiffs  who  were  not  celebrities.  B  is

1074

incorrect  for  this  reason  and  because  every  article  of  interest  to  a
publication's readers enriches the publisher by increasing the demand
for its product. Although the publication of facts that are contained in
public records is protected by the First Amendment, the commercial
use of such information is not necessarily protected. For this reason,
although C  would  be  an  effective  defense  against  a  claim  of  public
disclosure, it is not necessarily an effective defense against a claim of
appropriation.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  indicated  that
liability for false light privacy invasions cannot be imposed without a
showing of actual malice, but no such requirement exists for the tort
of appropriation. D is therefore incorrect.

171.  D  Damage  is  an  essential  element  of  a  negligence  action.  There  are
circumstances  under  which  a  plaintiff's  mental  suffering,  although
unrelated  to  physical  injury,  may  be  regarded  as  damage.  Mere
annoyance,  however,  is  probably  not  damage  sufficient  to  justify
recovery  for  negligence.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  this  argument
would defeat the claim of the landowner, D is the only argument listed
that could possibly lead to a judgment for the factory.

The reasonableness of a defendant's conduct is ordinarily determined
by weighing the risks that it creates against the benefits that it confers.
The  argument  set  forth  in  A  is  not  an  effective  defense,  however,
because  it  considers  only  the  benefit  resulting  from  the  use  of
unbagged concrete without balancing it against the resulting risks. A
is  therefore  incorrect.  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  any  result  that
would  not  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  the  landowner  would  not
have  experienced  annoyance  if  the  factory  had  not  used  unbagged
cement,  the  use  of  unbagged  cement  was  a  factual  cause  of  the
landowner's annoyance. B is therefore incorrect. A plaintiff assumes a
risk  when  he  or  she  knows  of  it  and  voluntarily  encounters  it.  C  is
incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  that  the  landowner's
encounter with the dust was voluntary.

172.  D  Although  the  plaintiff  can  still  collect  her  judgment  from  either  of
them or from both of them in any combination, as between themselves,
the defendants' contributive shares will be in proportion to their fault.
Thus,  the  plaintiff  could  collect  $100,000  from  the  first  defendant.
After  paying  this  sum,  however,  the  first  defendant  is  entitled  to
contribution from the second defendant in a sum proportionate to the
second defendant's fault. Since the second defendant was 60 percent

1075

at fault, the first defendant is entitled to collect 60 percent of what he
paid, or $60,000.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  jurisdiction  recognizes  a  right  of
contribution. B  is  incorrect  because  the  court  found  that  the  second
defendant  was  60  percent  at  fault.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  given
statute based contribution on apportionment of fault.

173. D The doctrine of respondeat superior makes an employer vicariously
liable to a plaintiff for torts committed by an employee acting within
the scope of employment. But the concept of indemnity may shift the
burden of payment from the one who actually did pay to the one who
should have paid. Therefore, an employer who has been required to
pay  for  a  tort  committed  by  an  employee  is  entitled  to  complete
indemnity (i.e., repayment) from the employee.

The  concept  of  vicarious  liability  determines  a  plaintiff's  rights
against a tortfeasor's employer, but it does not determine the rights of
that  employer  against  its  employee.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  When
parties are found to be jointly and severally liable to a plaintiff, the
plaintiff may collect all of his or her damages from any one of them or
from all of them in any combination whatsoever. For this reason, one
of the joint tortfeasors may be required to pay more than its fair share
of the plaintiff's damages. After this happens, most jurisdictions allow
the one who has paid to seek partial repayment from the others so that
each ends up paying a fair share. The majority of jurisdictions apply
the  equal  apportionment  approach,  determining  fair  shares  by
dividing the amount paid by the number of joint tortfeasors (treating
an  employee  and  employer  who  is  vicariously  liable  for  his  or  her
tort  as  a  single  unit  for  this  purpose).  In  these  jurisdictions,  joint
tortfeasors  who  pay  more  than  their  fair  share  are  said  to  seek
“contribution.”  Other  jurisdictions  apply  the  apportionment  of  fault
approach, basing the determination of fair shares on the relative fault
of  the  joint  tortfeasors.  In  these  jurisdictions,  joint  tortfeasors  who
pay more than their fair share are said to seek “partial indemnity.” B
and  C  are  both  incorrect,  however,  because  all  jurisdictions
recognize that a party who pays only because he or she is vicariously
liable for the tort committed by another person is entitled to complete
indemnity from that person.

174. A One who is negligent is liable for all harm proximately caused by that
negligence.  Negligence  is  a  proximate  cause  of  harm  if  that

1076

negligence  was  a  factual  cause  of  the  harm  and  if  the  harm  was  a
foreseeable consequence of the negligence. Since the biker's right leg
would not have been broken without the second driver's negligence,
and since a broken leg is a foreseeable consequence of being run over
by a car, the second driver's negligence was a proximate cause of the
biker's  broken  right  leg.  However,  since  the  biker's  left  leg  would
have been broken without the second driver's negligence, the second
driver's  negligence  was  not  a  factual  cause  of  it,  and  the  second
driver cannot be held liable for it.

175. C A defendant's conduct is a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm if it
was both a factual and legal cause of that harm. Conduct is a factual
cause of harm if the harm would not have occurred without it. Since
the truck would not have leaked gas if it had not been parked in front
of the builder's construction site where it was struck by falling debris,
the driver's parking it there was a factual cause of the woman's harm.
Conduct is a legal cause of harm if the harm was a foreseeable result
of  it  and  was  not  brought  about  by  an  unforeseeable  intervention.
Since the explosion would not have occurred if debris had not fallen
onto  the  truck  after  the  driver  parked  it,  the  falling  debris  was  an
intervening cause of the woman's harm. If that intervening cause was
foreseeable, however, the driver's conduct could still be regarded as
a legal cause of the explosion. On the other hand, if the intervention of
the falling debris was unforeseeable, the driver's conduct would not
be regarded as a legal cause of the explosion, and the driver could not
be held liable for the resulting damage. Whether the driver could have
anticipated  that  debris  would  fall  and  damage  the  truck  cannot  be
determined from the facts, but C is the only argument listed that could
possibly be effective in the driver's defense.

A  superseding  cause  of  harm  is  an  unforeseeable  intervening  cause.
An intervening cause is something that happened after the defendant's
conduct,  and  without  which  the  accident  would  not  have  occurred.
Although  the  builder's  use  of  poor-quality  steel  was  a  cause  of  the
woman's injury (because the injury would not have occurred without
it), it preceded the driver's conduct and thus was not an intervening
cause. It could not, therefore, have been a superseding cause. For this
reason,  A  is  incorrect.  The  fact  that  the  explosion  would  not  have
occurred  if  the  man  had  not  thrown  a  lit  cigarette  into  the  street
proves that the man's conduct was a cause of the woman's harm. The
fact  that  the  man's  act  occurred  after  the  driver's  conduct  makes  the

1077

man's  act  an  intervening  cause.  B  is  incorrect,  however,  because
unless  its  occurrence  was  unforeseeable,  the  fact  that  there  was  an
intervening cause is not sufficient to prevent the driver's conduct from
being a proximate cause of the woman's injury. Since any result may
have  several  proximate  causes,  it  is  never  correct  to  conclude  that
one thing was not a proximate cause because another thing was. D is
incorrect because the driver's conduct and the earthquake could both
have been proximate causes of the woman's injury.

176. A Although the manufacturer of a defective product may be held liable
without  fault  to  a  person  injured,  it  is  necessary  for  the  plaintiff  to
show that his or her injury was proximately caused by the product's
defect. If there was a superseding intervening cause of the harm, the
defect was not the proximate cause. An intervening cause of harm is a
superseding cause if its occurrence was unforeseeable. Thus, if it was
unforeseeable  that  the  contractor  would  disregard  the  warning,  the
contractor's conduct would be a superseding cause of the customer's
injury.  Although  cases  have  held  that  intervening  negligence  is
foreseeable, many cases have held that when the intervention involves
the disregard of a known risk, it is unforeseeable. For this reason, it
is  impossible  to  tell  whether  the  contractor's  intervening  conduct
would  be  found  to  be  unforeseeable.  Of  all  the  arguments  listed,
however,  A  is  the  only  one  that  could  possibly  be  effective  in  the
manufacturer's defense.

B  is  incorrect  because  strict  liability  may  be  applied  to  make  the
manufacturer of a defective product liable without regard to whether
it  acted  reasonably.  C  is  incorrect  because  strict  products  liability
may be imposed to benefit any injured person whose contact with the
defective product was foreseeable, without regard to the existence of
a  business  relationship  between  the  defendant  and  plaintiff.  D  is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  the
reasonable  person  in  the  store  owner's  position  would  not  have
selected  the  contractor  to  do  the  job,  and  second,  intervening
negligence by a third party is not a superseding cause of harm unless
it was unforeseeable.

177. D If the plaintiff is a public figure, he or she can recover in defamation
only  if  he  or  she  shows  that  the  statement  was  made  either  with
knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard to
its truth. However, if the plaintiff is a private figure, he or she is not

1078

required to prove that the defendant knew the statement was false or
recklessly  disregarded  its  truth  or  falsity.  However,  even  if  the
plaintiff is a private figure, he or she has to show at least negligence
by  the  defendant  regarding  the  truth  of  the  statement.  If  the  plaintiff
does  prove  that  defendant  was  negligent  in  not  ascertaining  that  the
communication was false, most states allow the plaintiff to recover if
the plaintiff is not a public figure. Here, the plaintiff has shown that
the defendant was at least negligent in making the statement. A and B
are  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  a  plaintiff  in  a
defamation  case  does  not  have  to  prove  that  the  defendant  actually
intended to cause harm to the plaintiff's reputation.

178. A Under the all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence, unreasonable
conduct by a plaintiff is a complete bar to recovery. Since the ladder
was in plain view, it was probably unreasonable (i.e., contributorily
negligent) for the employee not to see it. Although it is not certain that
a  jury  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  A  is  the  only  argument  listed
that could possibly provide the painter with an effective defense.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  special  rules  that  limit  the  duty  owed  to
trespassers protect only the landholder, and no one but he or she or a
member  of  his  or  her  household  may  successfully  assert  them  in
defense.  C  is  incorrect  because  a  defendant  owes  a  duty  of
reasonable care to any person who may foreseeably be injured by his
or her conduct, whether such persons are licensees of another or not.
One  whose  negligence  proximately  causes  an  injury  to  another  is
liable for damages even though there were other causes of that injury.
For this reason, D is incorrect.

179. D Under the “substantial factor” rule of causation, a defendant's conduct
is a cause of a particular consequence if it was a substantial factor in
bringing that consequence about. Conduct that would have produced a
particular  consequence  all  by  itself  was  a  substantial  factor  in
producing that consequence even if other factors happened to combine
with  that  conduct  to  bring  the  consequence  about.  Since  either
defendant's  conduct  alone  would  have  made  the  driver  intoxicated,
each  was  a  substantial  factor  in  making  the  driver  intoxicated.  Each
was,  therefore,  a  cause  of  the  driver's  intoxication.  Under  the  “but
for”  rule  of  causation,  a  condition  is  a  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm
would not have occurred without that condition. Since the plaintiff's
injury  would  not  have  occurred  had  the  driver  not  been  intoxicated,

1079

the driver's intoxication was a cause of the plaintiff's injury. Since the
conduct  of  both  defendants  were  causes  of  the  driver's  intoxication,
and since the driver's intoxication was a cause of the plaintiff's injury,
the conduct of both drivers were causes of the plaintiff's injury.

180.  A  The  fact  that  an  accident  occurred  is  not  enough  to  prove  that  the
architect was negligent, even if he could have avoided the accident by
using  two  pillars.  Negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct.  If  the
architect's conduct was reasonable, it could not have been negligent.
Since the facts are not sufficient to permit a conclusion as to whether
or not the architect's conduct was reasonable, it is not certain that a
jury would be convinced by the architect's contention. A  is  the  only
argument  listed,  however,  that  could  possibly  provide  the  architect
with an effective defense.

A  defendant  owes  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  all  persons  who  are
placed  at  foreseeable  risk  as  a  result  of  that  defendant's  conduct.
Since  it  was  foreseeable  that  the  landowner  would  hire  a  mover  to
bring furniture into the new house, the architect thus owed the mover a
duty  to  act  reasonably  in  designing  the  house  and  could  be  liable  to
the mover for breaching it. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  doctrine  of
“last clear chance” has become obsolete in most jurisdictions. All it
ever did (and all it does in those jurisdictions in which it survives) is
excuse  a  plaintiff  from  the  consequences  of  his  own  contributory
negligence. It was never an argument that a defendant would advance
because it never benefitted any party but a plaintiff. For these reasons,
it is inapplicable to this problem, and C is incorrect. D is incorrect
because the unreasonable exercise of professional judgment in making
a decision is negligence (or malpractice) and may result in liability.

181.  B  Violation  of  a  statute  may  establish  the  violator's  negligence  (or
liability)  in  a  particular  case  if  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect
against the risk that led to the plaintiff's harm. The pedestrian was not
hurt  because  the  man  was  drunk  but  because  the  man  had  been
poisoned.  (Note  that  the  facts  indicate  that  the  man  was  driving
reasonably.) If the statute was not meant to protect against the risk of
drinking poison, then its violation would not be relevant in the case of
an  injury  that  resulted  from  drinking  poison.  Since  poison  could  as
easily be drunk in non-alcoholic drinks, it is unlikely that the statute in
this case was designed to protect against drinking poison.

A is incorrect because the language of the statute appears to prohibit

1080

the  sale  of  alcohol  to  a  person  who  is  already  intoxicated  without
regard  to  how  he  got  intoxicated.  C  is  based  on  an  inaccurate
statement.  Conduct  is  a  cause  of  harm  if  that  harm  would  not  have
occurred without the conduct. Since the man's death and the resulting
accident  would  not  have  occurred  if  the  man  had  not  drunk  the
poisoned liquor, service of the liquor was a cause of the pedestrian's
injuries. C is therefore incorrect. If an intervening cause of harm was
unforeseeable,  it  may  be  called  a  superseding  cause  and  relieve  a
defendant of liability because his or her conduct was not a “legal” or
“proximate” cause of the injury. Causes that existed or occurred prior
to  the  defendant's  conduct  are  not  intervening  causes,  however,  and
therefore  cannot  be  superseding  causes  of  harm.  D  is  incorrect
because  the  employee's  conduct  preceded  the  bartender's  service  of
liquor to the man.

182. A Negligence is unreasonable conduct in the face of a foreseeable risk.
Thus,  unless  the  risk  that  the  contractor  created  was  foreseeable,  it
was not negligent for the contractor to create it. Adjusting the belt idle
improperly does not cause a belt truck to lurch if it is equipped with
an  accelerator  suppressor.  Thus,  if  belt  trucks  are  usually  equipped
with  acceleration  suppressors,  it  might  not  be  foreseeable  that
adjusting the belt idle improperly would cause a belt truck to lurch. If
this  risk  was  not  foreseeable,  the  contractor  was  not  negligent  in
creating  it.  Although  it  is  not  certain  that  a  jury  would  come  to  this
conclusion,  the  additional  fact  listed  in  A  is  the  only  one  that  could
possibly result in a judgment for the contractor.

Under  the  all-or-nothing  rule,  a  plaintiff  whose  own  negligence
contributed  to  the  accident  is  prevented  from  recovering.  B  is
incorrect,  however,  because  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  it  was
negligent  for  the  employee  to  attempt  to  activate  the  belt  while
standing on the ground. C and D are incorrect because a defendant is
liable  for  damage  that  was  proximately  caused  by  his  or  her
negligence  even  though  there  are  other  causes  or  other  parties  who
may also be liable.

183.  A  Public  nuisance  is  a  tortious  invasion  of  some  right  of  the  general
public. Ordinarily, a public nuisance action is brought on behalf of the
general  public  as  an  entity,  and  it  may  result  in  a  judgment  for
damage,  an  injunction,  or  both.  An  individual  may  bring  a  public
nuisance action on his or her own behalf, but only by showing that the

1081

public  nuisance  that  the  defendant  created  caused  the  individual
plaintiff  to  sustain  harm  so  different  from  that  of  the  general  public
that his or her damages would not be included in a judgment on behalf
of the general public. Most jurisdictions hold that in such an action,
the plaintiff's only remedy is a judgment for those damages. Since the
son's  claim  is  for  an  injunction  rather  than  for  the  son's  special
damage, public nuisance is not an appropriate vehicle for it.

An activity that does not disturb anyone but a super-sensitive plaintiff
is  probably  not  a  public  nuisance  since  it  does  not  interfere  with  a
public  right.  If  an  activity  does  disturb  the  general  public,  however,
and is therefore a public nuisance, the fact that the plaintiff's damage
resulted  from  a  special  sensitivity  will  not  prevent  him  or  her  from
recovering for that damage. (Note: This is the essence of the famous
“eggshell  skull”  hypothetical,  in  which  the  defendant  accidentally
drops  an  object  that  strikes  the  head  of  a  plaintiff  whose  skull  is  as
thin as an eggshell. If it was not foreseeable that dropping the object
would injure the ordinary person, the defendant was not negligent in
dropping it. But if it was foreseeable that dropping it would injure the
ordinary person, then the defendant was negligent in dropping it and
would be liable for the full extent of the plaintiff's injury even though
the ordinary person in the plaintiff's shoes would not have sustained
an injury as serious as that of the plaintiff.) B is therefore incorrect. A
plaintiff “assumes  the  risk”  when  he  or  she  voluntarily  encounters  a
risk  of  which  he  or  she  has  knowledge.  Although  assumption  of  the
risk  is  a  complete  defense  in  many  jurisdictions,  C  is  incorrect
because  the  claim  was  asserted  on  behalf  of  the  son,  and  the
homeowner  could  not  “assume  the  risk”  for  his  son.  D  is  incorrect,
because, although violation of a statute sometimes helps to establish
tort liability, compliance with a statute does not ordinarily prevent a
defendant from being liable in tort.

184. B A seller of a product that is defective at the time it was sold is held
strictly  liable  for  damages  that  result.  Thus,  if  the  product  was
defective when the drugstore sold it, the drugstore would be strictly
liable  to  the  doctor.  A  product  is  “defective  as  labeled”  if  its
condition  would  defeat  the  expectations  that  the  reasonable  person
would form upon reading its label. While it is not certain that a court
would come to this conclusion about the product, the argument in B is
the only one listed that could possibly support the doctor's claim.

1082

A  is  incorrect  because  the  negligence  of  a  manufacturer  is  not
ordinarily  imputed  to  a  retailer.  C  is  incorrect  because  any  express
warranty that was made referred to “normal hair or scalp” and would
therefore be inapplicable to the doctor. Although a drugstore might be
under  the  type  of  duty  set  forth  in  D,  there  is  no  indication  that  the
drugstore  failed  to  act  reasonably  in  pursuit  of  such  a  duty.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

185. C The statute given is typical of the “modified” comparative negligence
approach. Since the plaintiff was not at fault at all, however, it has no
relevance to her rights. No matter what approach a jurisdiction takes
to  contributory  or  comparative  negligence,  most  agree  that  joint
tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable to the injured plaintiff. In
this case, the court specifically held that the defendants are jointly and
severally  liable.  This  means  that  the  plaintiff  can  collect  all  her
damage from the first defendant, or the second defendant, or the two
of them in any combination.

186. A  In  general,  the  plaintiff  in  a  defamation  case  must  allege  and  prove
special damages to his or her reputation that occurred because of the
defendant's statements. However, if the defendant accuses the plaintiff
of having a “loathsome” disease (such as leprosy, venereal diseases,
or AIDS), the plaintiff is not required to show damages.

Consequently, B, C, and D are incorrect.

187.  B  All  the  products  liability  theories  require  proof  that  the  plaintiff
sustained damage as a result of his or her contact with the product. If
the man did not, he cannot succeed against the company on any theory.

A  is  incorrect  because  some  of  the  approaches  to  products  liability
(i.e., strict liability in tort and breach of warranty) do not depend on
the  unreasonableness  of  the  defendant's  conduct.  C  is  incorrect
because  compliance  with  a  statute  is  not  a  defense  to  any  products
liability  theory.  A  seller  who  recommends  a  particular  product,
knowing why the purchaser wants it and that the purchaser is relying
on the seller's judgment, may be held liable for breach of warranty if
the product is unfit for the buyer's particular purpose. D is incorrect,
however,  because  imposing  liability  on  the  grocery  store  would  not
prevent its being imposed on the company.

188.  C  Under  the  private  necessity  doctrine,  a  person  may  enter  another
person's  property  if  the  entry  is  necessary  to  protect  someone  from

1083

serious  harm.  This  is  a  complete  defense  to  a  trespass  claim.
However,  the  person  still  has  to  pay  for  any  damage  caused.  Here,
while the pilot was protecting himself from a plane crash, he would
still be liable for the damage to the crops. Therefore, A is incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  pilot's  lack  of  negligence  in  actually
landing the plane would not change the analysis in regards to private
necessity.  D  is  incorrect  because  although  the  pilot  could  probably
have made it back to the airport, the private necessity doctrine would
not require the pilot to be 100 percent sure that he could only avoid
serious harm by trespassing in the farmer's field.

189.  A  Intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  requires  outrageous
behavior that intentionally results in severe mental suffering. Because
the  plaintiff  was  only  embarrassed  by  the  incident,  the  defendant's
actions likely did not result in liability.

B is incorrect because even if the defendant was only joking, he may
still  have  had  the  required  mental  state  to  satisfy  the  intent
requirement if he desired or knew that mental suffering would result
from  his  act.  C  is  incorrect  because  although  some  jurisdictions
require  some  physical  manifestation  of  the  mental  suffering,  the
question  stated  the  plaintiff  was  only  embarrassed  and  suffered  no
physical  injury.  D  is  incorrect  because,  although  throwing  a
firecracker at someone could be outrageous, the plaintiff still did not
suffer the necessary harm.

190.  B  Negligence  is  a  breach  of  the  duty  to  act  reasonably.  A  defendant
owes such a duty to a plaintiff when the defendant's conduct creates a
foreseeable risk to the plaintiff. Since the installation of an automatic
door-opener  creates  obvious  risks  to  future  users  of  the  device,  the
installer owes them a duty to install it in a reasonable manner. If the
contractor  failed  to  do  so,  he  was  negligent.  Whether  or  not  it  was
unreasonable to disregard the warning is probably a question of fact
for the jury. The argument in B  is  the  only  one  listed,  however,  that
could possibly support the customer's claim.

When  the  defendant's  conduct  is  unknown,  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa
loquitur allows an inference that the defendant acted unreasonably to
be established circumstantially by proof that the accident was one that
would  not  ordinarily  have  occurred  without  negligence.  It  is
inapplicable  when  the  defendant's  conduct  was  known  and  the

1084

question to be determined is whether that conduct was unreasonable.
A is incorrect for this reason, and because there is no fact indicating
that  this  kind  of  accident  would  not  ordinarily  occur  without
negligence by the installer. According to UCC §2-314, every sale by a
merchant  implies  a  warranty  that  the  product  sold  is  fit  for  its
ordinary  use  (i.e.,  merchantable).  C  is  incorrect,  however,  because
the  contractor  did  not  sell  the  automatic  door-opener  and  therefore
did not impliedly warrant its fitness. The seller of a defective product
may  be  held  strictly  liable  for  damage  resulting  from  the  product's
defect. D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  contractor  was  not  the
seller of the automatic door-opener.

191. A Although damage is not an essential element of an action for trespass
to land, it is an essential element of a negligence action. Since there is
no indication that the homeowner was damaged, A is correct.

B is incorrect because, even in an emergency, a person is expected to
act as the reasonable person would under the circumstances (although
conduct that would ordinarily be regarded as unreasonable might be
reasonable in an emergency). While necessity is a defense to actions
for  intentional  tort,  it  is  not  a  defense  to  actions  founded  in
negligence.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  probably  an  accurate
statement, but its effect is to impose a duty of reasonable care on the
homeowner, not to relieve the driver of liability for negligence.

192.  A  The  doctor  can  only  be  liable  if  he  or  she  acted  unreasonably  in
treating  the  patient.  Here,  the  court  found  the  doctor  acted
unreasonably, so the doctor would be liable for the patient's damages.

If  there  is  no  evidence  as  to  what  the  defendant  did,  the  doctrine  of
res ipsa loquitur might allow an inference regarding the defendant's
conduct.  This  doctrine  applies  when  the  accident  is  one  that  would
not  ordinarily  occur  without  negligence  and  the  defendant  is  in
exclusive control of whatever caused the harm. Here, the defendant's
conduct is known, and the defendant was not in exclusive control of
the tanks when the manufacturer filled them. Therefore B is incorrect.
C and D are incorrect, because under the circumstances, the fact the
patient's death likely resulted from the manufacturer's negligence did
not  establish  that  the  death  did  not  also  result  from  the  doctor's
negligence.

QUESTIONS
____________________
PRACTICE MBE — A.M. EXAM

PRACTICE MBE — A.M. QUESTIONS

1. A man was looking out through the open window of his house when he
saw a robber knock down an old woman and snatch her handbag. As
the robber ran off with the woman's purse, the man grabbed a wooden
board and jumped through his window. After chasing the robber for
two blocks, the man caught up with him and struck him on the head
with the wooden board. The man retrieved the purse and returned it to
the woman. The robber subsequently died as the result of being struck
by the man.

If the man is prosecuted for criminal homicide, his most effective
argument in defense would be that he used force that

(A) the woman would have been privileged to use to defend herself.

(B) the reasonable person in the man's position would have used to

defend the woman.

(C) the reasonable person in the woman's position would have used to

defend her property.

(D) the reasonable person in the man's position would have used to

prevent the robber's escape from a crime.

2. At the trial of an action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant
for damages resulting from breach of contract, the plaintiff's attorney
called the witness as a witness on the plaintiff's direct case. After the
witness was sworn, the plaintiff's attorney asked only one question:
“Are you employed by the defendant in this case?” The witness
answered, “Yes.” The plaintiff's attorney then said, “I have no further
questions.”

On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the witness, “Do
you have any personal knowledge of the contract that is the basis of

1086

this lawsuit?”

If the plaintiff's attorney objects to the question, which of the following
would be the most effective argument in support of that objection?

(A) The defendant may not impeach its own witness.

(B) The question is leading.

(C) The question is argumentative.

(D) The question goes beyond the scope of cross-examination.

3. After being informed that members of a college fraternity were

engaged in the unlawful sale of cocaine, police officers obtained a
warrant to search the fraternity house. While searching, the officers
discovered the defendant, a guest of one of the fraternity's members,
sitting on a bed in a room of the house. Under the bed was a locked
trunk. Inside the trunk, the officers found a box of cocaine. They
immediately placed the defendant under arrest for possession of
cocaine and, upon searching her, found a plastic bag in her pocket
containing marijuana. Subsequently charged with the unlawful
possession of marijuana, the defendant moved to suppress use of the
marijuana as evidence against her.

Which of the following would be the prosecution's most effective
argument in response to the defendant's motion?

(A) Marijuana found in the defendant's possession could properly be

seized as “fruit of the poisonous tree.”

(B) The defendant's proximity to the trunk gave the officers probable
cause to believe that she was guilty of possessing cocaine.

(C) The officers searching the fraternity house were entitled to frisk all
persons present to protect themselves against the possibility of
physical attack.

(D) A warrant authorizing the search of specified premises permits the
arrest of all persons present at the time the warrant is executed.

4. Upon inheriting her aunt's ranch, the seller subdivided it into 1,000
separate numbered parcels of realty and offered them for sale. After
inspecting a parcel that had no building on it, the buyer and his attorney
went to see the seller in her sales office. After negotiation, the seller
accepted the buyer's offer to purchase the parcel for $15,000. At the

1087

buyer's request, the attorney prepared a contract of sale, using a printed
form that the attorney had brought with her. While doing so, the
attorney asked the seller how to identify the parcel involved. Although
its correct identification was “Parcel 241,” the seller inadvertently
referred to it as “Parcel 341.” None of them were aware of the seller's
error. As soon as the attorney finished preparing it, the seller and the
buyer signed a contract that described the realty as Parcel No. 341.

Although Parcels No. 241 and No. 341 were the same size, Parcel No.
341 had a valuable building on it that made it worth $80,000. Prior to
the date set for closing, the seller realized her mistake. She
immediately informed the buyer of the error. If the buyer sues the
seller for an order directing her to convey Parcel No. 341 to him for
$15,000, which of the following would be the seller's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) The buyer should have known that realty with a building on it was

more valuable than realty without a building on it.

(B) The buyer selected the attorney to prepare the contract.

(C) Parcel No. 341 was substantially more valuable than Parcel No.

241.

(D) Both the seller and the buyer were mistaken about the identity of the

parcel described in the contract.

5. A state law provides that no person may hold elective state office
while acting as a practicing member of the clergy of any religious
organization. The plaintiff, a practicing member of the clergy, asked the
state commissioner of elections to enter his name as a candidate for the
office of state legislator. The commissioner advised the plaintiff that
under the state law described above, she could do so only if the
plaintiff resigned his position.

If the plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of the state law on the
ground that it violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First
Amendment, which of the following arguments best supports the
conclusion that the statute is unconstitutional?

(A) A state may not set qualifications for elective state office that are

different from those for elective federal office.

(B) The state may not set qualifications for practicing members of the

1088

(C) The statute creates political divisiveness along religious lines.

(D) The statute discriminates against persons because of their religious

affiliations.

6. A girl's mother, a citizen of State A, brought suit in federal district

court in State A against a saddle maker, a citizen of State B, after the
girl fell during a riding lesson. The mother bought the saddle from the
saddle maker online, and the saddle maker shipped it to her directly in
State A. State A's long-arm statute stated that service could be made on
out-of-state individuals by first-class mail, so long as the alleged
injury occurred within State A. State B did not allow service by mail.

Is service proper if the girl's mother sends it to the saddle maker by
first-class mail?

(A) Yes, because the federal district court sits in State A.

(B) Yes, because it is allowed under federal law.

(C) No, because it is not allowed under federal law.

(D) No, because State B does not allow it.

7. The victim, who was employed as a security guard, was required to
carry a loaded pistol on the job. While traveling to and from his job,
however, he kept the pistol unloaded. Driving to work one day, the
victim's car was struck from behind by a car operated by the defendant.
In the discussion that ensued, the defendant used language that the
victim found offensive. At that point, the victim turned his back on the
defendant and attempted to walk away. Angry, the defendant ran after
the victim and slapped him in the face. Although the victim did not
intend to shoot the defendant, he pulled his pistol from its holster and
began loading it, hoping that the defendant would become frightened
and leave him alone. When the defendant saw the victim loading the
pistol, he thought of running away, but he was afraid that the victim
would shoot him if he tried to do so. Drawing a knife from his pocket,
the defendant stabbed the victim in the chest. The defendant was
subsequently arrested and charged with assaulting the victim with a
deadly weapon.

If the defendant asserts the privilege of self-defense, he should be
found

1089

(A) guilty, because as the initial aggressor, the defendant had no

privilege to use deadly force.

(B) guilty, because the defendant could have successfully escaped in his

car without being shot by the victim.

(C) not guilty, because the defendant's fear of being shot by the victim

was reasonable.

(D) not guilty, because the victim should have known that by loading his
pistol, he was inviting the use of deadly force by the defendant.

8. The plaintiff was a passenger on a motorcycle operated by her friend
when it collided with a car operated by the defendant. As a result of
the collision, the plaintiff sustained injuries that required her
hospitalization. Although the plaintiff's hospital bills were high, they
were paid in full by the insurance company under a policy that the
plaintiff had purchased previously. In litigation by the plaintiff against
the defendant for negligence, a jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of
$50,000. Prior to the entry of judgment, the defendant's attorney made
an appropriate motion asking the court to reduce the damage award by
the amount that the plaintiff had already received from the insurance
company.

The motion to reduce the plaintiff's damage award should be

(A) denied, because the insurance company was not acting for any

person liable to the plaintiff for negligence.

(B) denied, because payment by the insurance company was not the

result of a judicial determination.

(C) granted, because the plaintiff should not be permitted to receive a

double recovery.

(D) granted, because the defendant is entitled to partial indemnity.

9. The defendant operated a computer repair business, servicing the

computers of several large organizations with the assistance of her
daughter. When the defendant decided to retire, she sold the entire
business to her daughter. As part of the sale, she assigned to her
daughter a written contract to repair and service all the plaintiff's
computers for a period of three years in return for a fixed monthly
payment.

1090

The day after her assignment to her daughter, the defendant notified the
plaintiff about it by telephone. Because the plaintiff knew that the
daughter had worked on his computers in the past, he consented to the
assignment and orally agreed to release the defendant from all further
obligation or liability under their contract. The plaintiff subsequently
became dissatisfied with the daughter's service, however, and asserted
a claim against the defendant for breach of contract.

If the defendant's only defense is that the plaintiff agreed to release her
from all further obligation or liability under their contract, which of
the following would be the plaintiff's most effective argument in
response to that defense?

(A) The defendant is attempting to use parol evidence to contradict or

modify the terms of an unambiguous written agreement.

(B) There was no consideration for the plaintiff's agreement to release

the defendant of further obligation or liability under the contract.

(C) The agreement to release the defendant of further obligation or

liability under the contract was not in writing.

(D) The defendant's delegation to her daughter and the plaintiff's
agreement to release the defendant constituted an accord and
satisfaction.

10. A doctor sued a truck driver in state court in State A for injuries he

received in an automobile accident. Under State A law, any negligence
on a plaintiff's part barred the plaintiff from recovery. The court found
in favor of the doctor and awarded him $100,000 in damages. The
truck driver then brought a negligence suit against the doctor in state
court in State A to recover the damages done to his truck. State A law
did not require any claim to be a compulsory counterclaim.

May the truck driver bring his action against the doctor?

(A) No, because the issue of the doctor's negligence was already

litigated.

(B) No, because the property damage arose from the same transaction

or occurrence.

(C) Yes, because State A does not require any claim to be a compulsory

counterclaim.

1091

(D) Yes, because the truck driver is bringing his action in a state court

in State A.

11. Congress passes a law providing that no one who has been a member
of an organization that uses unlawful means to deprive any group of
persons of their rights under the United States Constitution is eligible
for employment by the federal government. If the constitutionality of
that law is challenged, it should be held

(A) unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.

(B) unconstitutional, because it prohibits members of certain

organizations from holding public office without regard to whether
those members knew the purpose of the organizations to which they
belonged.

(C) constitutional, because employment by the federal government is

not a right but a privilege.

(D) constitutional, because the federal government has the right to
protect itself by not employing persons who hold views
inconsistent with the United States Constitution.

12. A river is located entirely within the state. Acting under authority

granted by Congress, the Federal Transportation Commission awarded
a contract to the company for the construction of a bridge over the river
so road users could enter a neighboring state for business. The contract
required that all materials used in constructing the bridge be purchased
within the state.

A state statute imposes a 6 percent sales tax, to be paid by the buyer,
on any purchases made within the state. Upon purchasing steel in the
state for use in the construction of the bridge, the company refused to
pay the sales tax. As a result, the state prosecuted the company for
violating the sales tax statute.

If the company's only defense is that in fulfilling a contract with the
federal government, it was immune from the state sales tax statute, the
court should find the company

(A) not guilty since the bridge was to be used in interstate commerce.

(B) not guilty, because the state lacks power to tax activities of the

federal government.

1092

(C) guilty, because independent contractors working for the federal

government are subject to state taxes.

(D) guilty, because the company's contract with the Federal

Transportation Commission was not on a cost-plus-fixed-profit
basis.

13. When the plaintiff applied for a job as a nurse at a hospital, the

hospital's personnel department sent questionnaires to doctors on its
staff, requesting information about the plaintiff. The defendant, a doctor
on staff, knew the plaintiff from when they had both been employed at
another clinic. Since the defendant had heard another doctor who was
very well respected as a trainer and mentor of nurses at that clinic
accuse the plaintiff of incompetence resulting in the death of a patient,
the defendant disliked the plaintiff. In fact, however, the doctor who
made the accusation had mistaken the plaintiff for another nurse, and
the plaintiff had been cleared of blame by a clinic board of inquiry.

Hoping that the plaintiff's job application would be rejected, the
defendant wrote on the questionnaire, “I once heard that the plaintiff's
incompetence resulted in the death of a patient.” The hospital did not
hire the plaintiff.

If the plaintiff asserts a defamation claim against the defendant for the
defendant's statement in the questionnaire, the court should find for

(A) The defendant, because the defendant reasonably believed that the

plaintiff's incompetence resulted in the death of a patient.

(B) The defendant, because the statement clearly indicated that the

defendant had heard the accusation from another.

(C) The plaintiff, because the defendant's dislike of the plaintiff and the
defendant's hope that the plaintiff's job application would be
rejected amounted to actual malice.

(D) The plaintiff, because the statement resulted in the hospital not

hiring the plaintiff.

14. In December 2009, the seller, a manufacturer of packaging materials,
entered into a written agreement with the buyer, a wholesaler of
melons. The agreement provided that the buyer would purchase from
the seller all the boxes required by the buyer for packaging melons in
2012, but that in no event would the number of boxes required be less

1093

than 2,000.

After the agreement was executed, the price of melons fell from $1 per
melon to $0.80 per melon. As a result, the buyer notified the seller in
January 2012 that he intended to package melons in bags instead of
boxes and that he would not order any boxes from the seller in 2012.

In January 2012, the seller instituted an action against the buyer for
damages. If the buyer asks the court to dismiss the seller's action,
should the court do so?

(A) Yes, because the buyer might still order 2,000 boxes by the end of

2012.

(B) Yes, because the provision that required the seller to furnish all the
boxes required by the buyer in 2012 makes it impossible for the
court to determine the seller's damages.

(C) No, because damages are presumed to result from every breach of

contract.

(D) No, because the buyer has stated that he will not fulfill his

obligations under the contract.

15. A riot broke out during a political rally in the town. Subsequently, a
newspaper published an editorial about the rally and the ensuing
disruption. The editorial stated that “Police present at the rally beat
and kicked innocent bystanders and engaged in other acts of senseless
and unnecessary brutality.” Following publication of the editorial, the
four police officers who were present at the rally asserted a
defamation claim against the newspaper.

The only argument raised by the newspaper in defense is that the
statements contained in the editorial did not identify the plaintiffs. The
court should find for

(A) the plaintiffs, because the number of police present at the rally was
so small that readers who knew the plaintiffs would believe that
the statement had been made about them.

(B) the plaintiffs, because they were engaged in their official duties as

police officers.

(C) the plaintiffs, because the statement was slander per se.

1094

(D) the newspaper, because the statement did not specifically name the

plaintiffs.

16. A woman was called as a juror in a claim brought in federal district
court. The action involved a man's claim that he was unlawfully
targeted and beaten by several local police officers because of his
race. During voir dire, the woman stated she would find it hard to keep
an open mind because she believed that police officers and
departments habitually discriminated against minorities. However, she
said she had no strong feelings or prior knowledge about the case or
the parties involved. Both the woman and the man were black, while
the police officers involved were white.

Based on her statements during voir dire, would it be proper for the
juror to be excused?

(A) No, because the juror cannot be excused based on her race.

(B) No, because the juror stated she had no strong feelings or prior

knowledge about the case or parties.

(C) Yes, because the juror stated it would be hard to keep an open

mind.

(D) Yes, because the juror had an implied bias in the man's favor.

17. The plaintiff asserted a tort claim against the defendant for battery but
died of cancer before the trial. At the trial, the witness was called as a
witness by the attorney for the plaintiff's estate. The witness testified
that she was a police officer called to the scene of a shooting, and that
when she arrived, she found the plaintiff lying on the ground in a pool
of blood. The witness stated that when she asked the plaintiff to tell her
what happened, the plaintiff replied, “Tell my wife to meet me at the
hospital and tell her that the defendant shot me.”

The defendant objected. If the court finds that the plaintiff's statement
to the witness was not a dying declaration, it will probably be because

(A) the plaintiff did not believe that he was dying when he made the

statement.

(B) the plaintiff did not die as a result of the shooting.

(C) the witness's testimony was not being offered at the trial of a

criminal prosecution.

1095

(D) the plaintiff's statement was not made spontaneously.

18. A man was injured when a boiler in his building exploded. The man

sued the owner of the building. The man hired an accident investigator
who talked to one of the building's maintenance workers. The
maintenance worker told the investigator that the boiler exploded
because the building owner failed to make necessary repairs. The man
also hired an expert in boiler explosions. The expert read the
investigator's report. The expert then testified on behalf of the man,
saying the boiler exploded because the building owner failed to make
necessary repairs. She based her testimony in part on the maintenance
worker's statement because other experts in boiler explosion analysis
would do so.

Assuming the maintenance worker's statement is inadmissible hearsay,
may the expert base part of her testimony on the statement?

(A) No, because the maintenance worker's statement is not

substantively admissible.

(B) No, because the expert did not interview the maintenance worker

herself.

(C) Yes, because the expert's use of the statement in her testimony

makes the statement substantively admissible.

(D) Yes, because other experts in the field would rely on the

maintenance worker's statement.

19. After serving a portion of his sentence in a state prison, the plaintiff

applied for parole in accordance with state law. His application was
denied following a State Parole Board hearing at which the plaintiff
was not permitted to appear either in person or by counsel. The
plaintiff subsequently instituted a proceeding in a state court in which
he claimed that the hearing violated his right to due process under the
federal and state constitutions. The state court found for the plaintiff.
On appeal by the State Parole Board, the highest appellate court in the
state affirmed. In its decision, the court refused to consider claims
under the federal constitution but concluded that the state constitution
had been violated.

On application by the State Parole Board, is judicial review by the
United States Supreme Court available?

1096

(A) No.

(B) Yes, by certiorari only.

(C) Yes, by appeal only.

(D) Yes, by either certiorari or appeal.

20. The defendant was charged with violating a state law that made it a

crime to knowingly issue a worthless check. On the presentation of its
direct case at trial, the prosecution offered into evidence a properly
authenticated judgment showing that the defendant had been convicted
of violating the same law three years earlier. The defendant's counsel
objected. Which of the following statements is correct about the
judgment of conviction?

(A) It is admissible as substantive evidence of modus operandi.

(B) It is admissible to impeach the defendant's credibility.

(C) It is admissible both as substantive evidence of modus operandi

and to impeach the defendant's credibility.

(D) It is inadmissible.

21. A landowner conveyed a large nature area “to the county, but if the
land ceases to be used as a nature park, to my friend and his heirs.”
What interests are created by this conveyance?

(A) The county has a fee simple absolute.

(B) The county has a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, and

the friend has an executory interest.

(C) The county has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and

the friend has a right of entry.

(D) The county has a fee simple determinable, and the friend has a

possibility of reverter.

22. A landowner decided to make a gift to his son of a parcel of land he
owned. He properly prepared a deed for the transfer of the land
according to state law and handed it to his son, saying “I want you to
own this land.” Nine months later, the landowner met a woman and fell
deeply in love with her. Soon thereafter, he had a fight with his son
about the woman. He told his son to return or destroy the deed because
he was “revoking his gift.” The son made a photocopy of the deed and
gave the deed back to the landowner. The landowner then threw the

1097

deed in a fire. Two months later, the landowner died, leaving all of his
real and personal property to the woman.

Who owns the land?

(A) The woman, because the son returned the deed to the landowner.

(B) The woman, because the landowner told the son he was revoking

his gift.

(C) The son, because he kept a photocopy of the deed.

(D) The son, because the landowner gave him the deed.

23. A woman purchased a food and beverage processing machine as a gift
for her husband. The machine was manufactured by the company and
was purchased by the woman from a store, a retailer. When the woman
got home, she unpacked the machine, placed it on the kitchen counter,
and plugged it into an electrical outlet. When she started the machine,
however, she noticed a jarring vibration. She immediately switched the
machine off and telephoned the store. After she described the vibration
to a store employee, the employee said, “If the processor vibrates like
that, it is defective. Don't try to use it. It's inherently dangerous.”

The woman left the processing machine on the counter, still plugged in,
and went out for the evening. The husband arrived home soon
afterwards. With him was a neighbor. When the husband saw the
processing machine on the counter, he decided to use it to mix drinks
for the neighbor and himself. After placing the necessary ingredients in
the machine's glass container, the husband switched it on. The machine
immediately began to vibrate, causing the glass container to shatter.
The neighbor was seriously injured by flying glass.

The neighbor asserts a claim against the store for damages resulting
from a defect in the processing machine. Which of the following
would be the store's most effective argument in defense against that
claim?

(A) The neighbor was a bystander.

(B) The woman had assumed the risk by leaving the processing

machine plugged into the electrical outlet.

(C) The processing machine was defective at the time it left the

company's factory.

1098

(D) The woman's conduct in leaving the processing machine plugged
into the electrical outlet was a superseding cause of harm.

24. The plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of a state law that

provides that no contraceptive device that requires insertion into a
cavity of the human body may be sold without a prescription. If the
only argument used by the plaintiff is that the statute violates the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because only women
use such devices, which of the following would be the most effective
argument in opposition to the plaintiff's claim?

(A) Gender is not a suspect classification.

(B) The statute has a rational basis because devices inserted into the

human body are more likely to cause harm than devices
manufactured solely for external use.

(C) The right to protect citizens against their own lack of judgment is

included in the state's police powers.

(D) The statute bears a substantial relationship to an important

government interest because devices inserted into the human body
are more likely to cause harm than devices manufactured solely for
external use.

25. On January 10, the plaintiff, a builder, entered into a written contract

with the defendant to construct a building on the defendant's realty. The
contract required the plaintiff to build to specifications furnished by the
architect and required the defendant to make periodic payments to the
plaintiff during construction. A final payment of $30,000 was to be
made when the building was complete. The contract provided,
however, that “In no event shall said final payment be required unless
the plaintiff obtains and presents to the defendant prior to July 30 a
Certificate of Satisfactory Completion issued by the architect
following final inspection by the architect.”

On July 15, after making all periodic payments required by the
contract, the defendant asked the architect to delay issuing a
Certificate of Satisfactory Completion until after July 30. The architect
agreed to do so. On July 20, the plaintiff notified the architect that the
building was complete and requested final inspection. The architect
did not inspect the building or issue a Certificate of Satisfactory
Completion until August 15. On August 16, the plaintiff requested final
payment from the defendant, presenting the Certificate. The defendant

1099

refused to make payment on the ground that the plaintiff did not obtain
the Certificate prior to July 30, as required by the contract.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for breach of
contract, which of the following would be the plaintiff's most effective
argument?

(A) The contract between the plaintiff and the defendant imposed upon

the architect an obligation to act reasonably in issuing the
Certificate of Satisfactory Completion.

(B) The plaintiff substantially performed all conditions of the contract

by completing the building prior to July 30.

(C) As a result of the defendant's request that the architect delay issuing
the Certificate of Satisfactory Completion, the plaintiff was not
required to obtain it prior to July 30.

(D) Applying an objective standard, satisfactory completion was

achieved prior to July 30.

26. At the defendant's trial on criminal charges, undisputed evidence
established that the defendant and his friend had planned to take a
certain fur coat from the victim's fur shop by threatening the victim
with a pistol carried by the friend; that when they did so, the victim
began shooting at them; and that the friend shot back with his pistol,
intentionally killing the victim.

Testifying on behalf of the prosecution, the friend stated that the
defendant knew that the friend's pistol would be loaded. He also stated
that the victim had handed the defendant the coat; that the friend had
returned his own gun to his pocket; and that he and the defendant were
on their way out of the victim's shop when the victim began shooting at
them.

The defendant testified that the coat in question had previously been
stolen from her by the victim, and that she and the friend were trying to
retrieve it.

Statutes in the jurisdiction define first degree murder as the intentional
unlawful killing of a human being, and second degree murder as the
unintentional killing of a human being by the defendant or an
accomplice during the course of a burglary, robbery, rape, kidnapping,

1100

or arson committed by the defendant.

The defendant is charged with first degree murder on the ground that
as a co-conspirator and accomplice, she is vicariously liable for the
friend's shooting of the victim. If the jury does not believe the
testimony of the friend or of the defendant, the defendant should be
found

(A) guilty, because she and the friend planned to take the coat by

threatening the victim with the friend's pistol.

(B) guilty, because she was present when the friend shot the victim.

(C) not guilty, because the victim shot first.

(D) not guilty, because she did not aid 

or abet the friend in shooting the victim.

27. On February 1, the landowner conveyed a parcel of realty to his friend
as a gift. The landowner executed the deed in the presence of a notary
public, and the notary affixed his seal as required by law. On March 1,
after the landowner learned that his friend had not recorded his title,
the landowner purported to convey the same parcel of realty to his
neighbor for value. The neighbor was unaware that the landowner's
friend held any interest in the 
realty. On March 15, the friend recorded the deed that he had received
from the landowner in February. In June, the neighbor executed a deed
conveying the realty to the notary. The notary immediately recorded the
deed.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “No transfer of an interest in
real property shall be good against a subsequent purchaser for value
without notice of such transfer unless it shall have been recorded.” In
litigation between the friend and the notary, who should be declared
owner of the realty?

(A) The friend, because the notary had notice that the realty had first

been conveyed to him.

(B) The friend because the landowner conveyed the property to him

first.

(C) The neighbor, because he purchased the property for value.

(D) The notary, because the neighbor 

1101

purchased the realty from the landowner before the friend recorded
his deed.

28. A boy and a girl were dating when they decided it was time for them to

try sexual intercourse. The girl was 17 years old. A statute in the
jurisdiction provided that any male who has sexual intercourse with a
female whom he knows to be under the age of 18 shall be guilty of
second degree rape.

If the boy is charged with second degree rape under the above statute,
which of the following facts or inferences, if it was the only one true,
would provide the boy with his most effective defense to that charge?

(A) The boy was 17 years of age at the time of the alleged crime.

(B) The boy did not know that the girl was below the age of 18 years

when he had sexual intercourse with her.

(C) The boy was intoxicated at the time he had sexual intercourse with

the girl.

(D) The girl was not intoxicated, and, in fact, consented to having

sexual intercourse with the boy.

29. A man sued a moving company for $100,000 in state court in State A
after the man was injured by one of the moving company's trucks. His
claim was based on State A motor vehicle law. The man was a citizen
of State A. The moving company was incorporated in State B and had
70 percent of its business operations in State A. However, all of the
company's directors and top management worked in State C.

Because of a large amount of local bad press, the moving company had
a good faith belief that any action against it in State A would be unfair.
May it remove the action to federal district court?

(A) No, because the man's claim was based on State A motor vehicle

law.

(B) No, because the moving company was a citizen of State A.

(C) Yes, because the moving company's directors and top management

worked in State C.

(D) Yes, because the moving company had a good faith belief that any

action against it in State A would be unfair.

1102

30. The defendant was driving her truck across a bridge when the bridge
collapsed, causing a car driven by the plaintiff to fall into the river.
The plaintiff subsequently asserted a negligence claim against the
defendant for injuries that he sustained in the fall.

A statute in the jurisdiction prohibits the operation of a vehicle
weighing more than 20,000 pounds at a speed in excess of 25 miles
per hour on any bridge in the state. At the trial, it was proven that the
defendant's truck weighed 30,000 pounds, and that the defendant was
driving it at a speed of 40 miles per hour when the bridge collapsed. It
was also proven that a truck weighing 30,000 pounds would have been
more likely to cause the bridge to collapse if driven across it at a
speed under 25 miles per hour than at a speed over 25 miles per hour.

The court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant's violation of the statute was

negligence per se.

(B) the plaintiff, because the defendant's violation of the statute raises a
presumption that the defendant's negligence was a proximate cause
of the plaintiff's injuries.

(C) the defendant, because the defendant's violation of statute was not a

factual cause of the plaintiff's injury.

(D) the defendant, because the defendant did not violate a statute that
was designed to protect a class of persons to which the plaintiff
belonged.

31. The landowner conveyed a lakefront parcel of realty to the buyer

“unless the realty is used for non-residential purposes, in which case
grantor or his successors may re-obtain possession.” Two years later,
by a properly executed document that was subsequently recorded, the
buyer granted a fisherman a license to enter the realty for a period of
five years to fish from the lake on which it fronted. If the landowner
commences an appropriate proceeding seeking possession of the realty,
the buyer's most effective argument in defense would be that

(A) the condition contained in the landowner's deed to the buyer

violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(B) fishing is a residential use of the realty.

(C) the landowner's deed created a fee simple subject to a condition

1103

subsequent.

(D) the condition contained in the landowner's deed to the buyer is void

as a restraint on alienation.

32. A sculptor and a famous architect entered into a contract to design a

new studio for the sculptor. The sculptor told the architect that she was
hiring her because she believed in her unique vision. The written
contract also provided that “neither party shall assign or delegate this
contract without the other party's written approval.”

The sculptor subsequently hired a builder who began construction of
the architect's design. As work progressed, the sculptor and the
architect argued frequently. When the building was 85 percent
complete, the architect refused to continue working for the sculptor
and executed a document purporting to assign the contract to another
architect. The architectural work that remained involved personal
services. The sculptor immediately ordered the builder to stop
construction and sued the architect for an order directing her to
specifically perform her obligations under the contract.

Should the court grant the relief requested by the sculptor?

(A) Yes, because the architectural work that remained to be completed
at the time of the architect's assignment involved personal services.

(B) Yes, because the agreement between the sculptor and the architect

prohibited assignment.

(C) No, because an agreement not to assign destroys the power but not

the right to make a valid assignment.

(D) No, because the architectural work that remained to be completed

at the time of the architect's assignment involved personal services.

33. At the trial of a breach of contract action brought by the plaintiff

against the defendant, the plaintiff testified in her own behalf. The
plaintiff stated that a man who called her on the telephone said that he
was the defendant and ordered goods from her at an agreed price. She
said that when she tried to deliver the goods, the defendant refused to
accept them. The plaintiff stated further that she had never spoken to
the defendant before or after that telephone conversation, but that she
had heard his voice in the judge's chambers immediately before the
trial began and that she recognized it as the voice of the person to

1104

whom she had spoken on the telephone.

If the defendant's attorney asks the court to exclude the plaintiff's
testimony regarding the identification of the voice on the telephone, the
plaintiff's statement should be

(A) admitted, because the plaintiff heard the defendant's voice in the

judge's chambers before testifying.

(B) admitted, because the person to whom the plaintiff spoke on the

telephone identified himself as the defendant.

(C) excluded, because the plaintiff had never spoken to the defendant

prior to the telephone conversation.

(D) excluded, because the plaintiff had not dialed the defendant's
telephone number before speaking to him on the telephone.

34. A chemical used in the manufacture of munitions is frequently found
floating, as dust, in the air of munitions factories. Since prolonged
inhalation of the chemical can cause lung disease, Congress passes an
Act to limit use of the chemical. Among other things, the Act prohibits
the operation of any munitions factory in which the chemical's airborne
levels exceed specified standards. The Act also establishes an Agency,
authorizes it to inspect munitions factories, and empowers it to issue
Closure Orders, enforceable by the Department of Justice, and
directing the closing of any factory operating in violation of the Act.
Section 34 of the Act provides that Closure Orders do not become
effective until 10 days after their approval by the National Defense
Committee of the Senate.

After determining that airborne levels of the chemical exceed statutory
standards in a munitions factory operated by the company, the Agency
issues a Closure Order, sending copies to the United States
Department of Justice and to the Senate National Defense Committee
as required by the Act. The Senate National Defense Committee
refuses to approve the Closure Order.

If the Department of Justice challenges the constitutionality of Section
34 of the Act in an appropriate proceeding, the court should find this
section

(A) constitutional, because circumstances known only to the Senate

National Defense Committee might make the continued operation of

1105

a particular munitions factory necessary to national security.

(B) constitutional, because after delegating its power to an

administrative agency, Congress may continue to act in a
supervisory capacity.

(C) unconstitutional, because Congress may not delegate to an

administrative agency the power to impose criminal or quasi-
criminal sanctions.

(D) unconstitutional, because Section 34 would allow the passage of

legislation by a committee of Congress.

35. The victim, who lived alone, was a collector of antiques. One day, the
defendant followed the victim to work. Knowing that the victim's
valuable antiques collection was stored in her home, the defendant
phoned the victim at work and told her that he had placed a bomb in
her home. He said that if she immediately paid him $1,000 in cash, he
would give the police information necessary for them to defuse the
bomb. If she did not pay him, he said would detonate the bomb,
destroying her home and her collection of antiques. The victim paid the
defendant as instructed. In reality, the defendant had not placed a bomb
in the victim's home.

What is the most serious offense of which the defendant is likely to be
convicted?

(A) Robbery.

(B) Extortion.

(C) Larceny by trick.

(D) Embezzlement.

36. A state law requires a permit for the use of certain recreational

facilities in state parks and fixes the annual fee for such permits at $25
for residents and $200 for non-residents. If a non-resident of the state
challenges the law as unconstitutional, the LEAST effective argument
in support of that claim would be that the law violates

(A) the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) the Obligation of Contracts Clause of Article I.

(C) the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

1106

(D) the Commerce Clause of Article I.

37. The seller and the buyer entered into a valid written contract for the
sale of the seller's home to the buyer. Subsequently, the seller's
neighbor, the defendant, telephoned the seller and said, “If you don't
back out of your contract with the buyer, there's going to be an accident
and one of your children is going to be seriously hurt. Understand?”
Before the seller had a chance to answer, the defendant hung up. The
seller became so frightened by the defendant's threat that he suffered an
immediate heart attack.

If the seller asserts a claim against the defendant for assault, which of
the following would be the defendant's LEAST effective argument in
defense against that claim?

(A) The defendant's statement did not justify apprehension of immediate

harm.

(B) The defendant told the seller that he could avoid harm by

complying with a specified condition.

(C) The defendant's threat was not directed against the person of the

seller.

(D) The defendant committed no physical act.

38. At his trial on a charge of arson committed in the city, the defendant
testified that on the day of the fire, he was not in the city but was
actually 1,000 miles away in another state. The prosecution
subsequently called a witness who testified that on the day of the fire,
she was in a liquor store in the city when the defendant came into the
store with a gun and robbed its owner. Over timely objection by the
defendant's attorney, the witness's testimony should be

(A) admitted for impeachment only.

(B) admitted as substantive evidence only.

(C) admitted for impeachment and as substantive evidence.

(D) excluded.

39. The landowner was the owner of a parcel of realty on which there

were several buildings and a gold mine. The landowner lived in one of
the buildings and personally worked the gold mine, earning a
comfortable living by selling the gold that he removed. The other

1107

buildings were vacant. When the landowner died, his will devised the
realty “to my friend, but if my friend should die without issue from his
wife, to the mailman.” The landowner's friend and his wife did not
have any children.

Which of the following statements is correct about the mailman's
interest in the realty?

(A) The landowner's will gave the mailman a vested remainder in the

property.

(B) The landowner's will gave the mailman a contingent remainder in

the property.

(C) The landowner's will gave the mailman a shifting executory interest

in the realty.

(D) The mailman has no interest in the realty.

40. After she was fired from her job, a saleswoman brought an action

against her former employer in federal district court in State A. The
saleswoman sought $50,000 in damages. The saleswoman was a
citizen of State A, while her former employer was incorporated in
State B and had its primary place of business in State C. The
saleswoman's action included claims for violation of federal
employment laws and for breach of contract under State A law. The
employer moved to dismiss the breach of contract claim.

How should the court rule?

(A) Grant the motion, because the contract claim is based on state law.

(B) Grant the motion, because the saleswoman is only claiming

$50,000 in damages.

(C) Deny the motion, because the saleswoman can bring all claims she

has against the company in her action.

(D) Deny the motion, because all of her claims arose from the

saleswoman's loss of her job.

41. At the defendant's trial on a charge of rape, the victim testified that on
March 1, the defendant forced her to have sexual intercourse with him
against her will. Testifying in his own defense, the defendant admitted
that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim on that date,
but he claimed that the victim had consented. The defendant stated

1108

further that the victim had not accused him of rape until April 3, when
she discovered that he was married and was living with his wife.

The prosecutor subsequently offered a properly authenticated public
record indicating that the defendant had been convicted of state income
tax fraud in another jurisdiction two years earlier. In both the
jurisdiction where the defendant was convicted and the jurisdiction
where the defendant was being tried for rape, state income tax fraud
was a felony. On objection by the defendant's attorney, the record
should be

(A) admitted.

(B) admitted, because state income tax fraud is a felony in the

jurisdiction where the defendant was convicted.

(C) admitted, because state income tax fraud is a felony in the
jurisdiction where the defendant was being tried for rape.

(D) excluded.

42. The defendant had been convicted of fraud on three separate occasions
and served three different prison sentences as a result. Soon after his
most recent release, the defendant proclaimed himself to be a minister
and began conducting prayer meetings on Sunday nights. During these
meetings, the defendant stated that his vows as minister prevented him
from working for money, and he asked the people present to make cash
contributions to provide for his personal needs. After collecting
several hundred dollars in this fashion, the defendant was arrested and
charged with fraud under a state law that prohibits any person from
making statements that he or she knows to be false for the purpose of
obtaining money from others.

In defense, the defendant asserted that a court could not convict him
without questioning the sincerity of his religious beliefs, and that the
prosecution therefore violated his First Amendment rights to freedom
of religion. He asked that the court dismiss the prosecution on that
ground.

Should the prosecution be dismissed?

(A) Yes.

(B) No, because a court may determine the sincerity of a person's

1109

religious beliefs without violating First Amendment rights to
freedom of religion.

(C) No, because First Amendment rights to freedom of religion cannot

be used to justify what would otherwise be a criminal act.

(D) No, because First Amendment rights to freedom of religion protect

beliefs, but not actions.

43. In which one of the following fact situations is the defendant most

likely to be properly convicted of violating a state law that prohibits
depriving any person of a right conferred by the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution?

(A) The defendant, the president of a university operated by a religious
organization, refused to admit certain students solely because of
their religion.

(B) The defendant, a federal court official, prevented certain persons
from serving on federal juries solely because of their race.

(C) The defendant, the principal of a public high school, expelled

certain students solely because they were pregnant.

(D) The defendant, the vice president of a bank, refused to grant loans
to certain applicants solely because of their place of national
origin.

44. The defendant was the manufacturer of a chemical used by photo
processors. A professional photographer customarily used the
chemical in his processing laboratory. On August 15, 2012, while
working in his laboratory, the photographer read the label of a bottle of
the chemical that he had purchased several months earlier. The label
said, “Best when used prior to June 1, 2012.” Although the
manufacturer knew that the chemical's fumes were extremely toxic, the
label contained no other statements. The photographer poured the
contents of the bottle down a drain that emptied into a municipal sewer.
Because the sewer was cracked, toxic fumes entered the home of the
plaintiff, causing the plaintiff to become seriously ill. The plaintiff's
home was located a half-mile from the photographer's laboratory.

The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim for damages against the
defendant manufacturer on the ground that the absence of a warning on
the bottle made the product defective and unreasonably dangerous.

1110

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would provide the defendant with its most effective
defense to the plaintiff's claim?

(A) The reasonable person would not have anticipated that the plaintiff

would come into contact with the chemical or its fumes.

(B) The photographer acted negligently in pouring the chemical down

the drain.

(C) The plaintiff's damage would not have occurred but for the crack in

the municipal sewer.

(D) The photographer had purchased the chemical from a retail store

that had purchased it from a wholesaler that had purchased it from
the defendant.

45. A man was injured when he was hit by a taxi. He sued the taxi driver in

federal district court in State A. Under the applicable statute of
limitations, the action had to be commenced by June 16 and an action
was deemed commenced when it was filed with the court. The man
filed his action on June 11. On June 12, he served the complaint on the
taxi driver. On June 13, he received a call from the owner of the taxi
company asking whether he would be brought into the action as well.
The man filed an amended complaint on June 17 that added the owner
as a co-defendant. On June 22, the man served the amended complaint
on both the taxi driver and the owner. The owner moved to dismiss the
complaint, arguing it was barred by the statute of limitations.

How should the court rule?

(A) Grant the motion, because the complaint was served on the owner

more than 10 days after the action commenced.

(B) Grant the motion, because the complaint was amended on June 17.

(C) Deny the motion, because both claims related to the taxi accident.

(D) Deny the motion, because the owner called to ask about the original

complaint.

46. A woman was the owner of a parcel of realty on which she lived with
her husband. The woman was admitted to a hospital following a severe
heart attack. While her husband was visiting her in the hospital, the
woman said, “I know I'm dying, and I want to be sure that you have the
land after I'm gone. Please have our lawyer take care of it.” The

1111

following day, the husband asked the family attorney to prepare a
quitclaim deed to the land for execution by the woman. The husband
brought the document to the woman in the hospital, where she executed
it according to the requirements of law. After signing the quitclaim
deed, the woman handed the document to the husband and said, “Please
put it in the safe deposit box at the bank.” The husband did so, but he
never recorded the quitclaim.

The woman subsequently recovered from her heart attack and was
moved from the hospital to a rest home, where she resided until 30
years later, when she died from other causes. At the woman's request,
the husband continued to occupy, maintain, and pay taxes on the land
throughout that period of time. During the last nine years of her life in
the rest home, the woman was attended by a nurse. When the woman
died, her will purported to leave the land “to my faithful nurse.” The
husband and the nurse subsequently asserted conflicting claims to the
land.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
husband?

(A) The woman intended the quitclaim deed to be a testamentary

substitute.

(B) The quitclaim deed to the husband was a gift causa mortis.

(C) The safe deposit box into which the woman asked the husband to
put the quitclaim deed was held jointly by the woman and the
husband.

(D) The statutory period for adverse possession is less than 30 years.

47. Assuming that the appropriate objection is made, in which of the

following fact situations is the offered evidence LEAST likely to be
excluded under the original document rule?

(A) In an action for breach of contract, the plaintiff offers a photocopy
of the contract, asserting that the original is kept at the plaintiff's
branch office, which is located in a foreign country.

(B) In a prosecution of the defendant for forging a check, the

prosecution — without producing the check or explaining its
absence — offers to call a witness who will testify that the

1112

defendant paid the witness for merchandise with a check to which
the defendant signed the name “James Grant.”

(C) In a personal injury action, the defendant — without producing the
X-ray or explaining its absence — calls a medical expert who
testifies that based solely on the examination of an X-ray, it is her
opinion that the plaintiff did not sustain a fracture of the skull.

(D) In a lawsuit by the plaintiff against the state tax collector, the

plaintiff offers to testify to the contents of her state income tax
return, asserting that she sent the original to the state tax collector
as required by law, and that she did not keep a copy.

48. A woman from the Southern District of State A was injured in a boating
accident in the Eastern District of State B. The woman sued two other
boaters involved in the accident in a federal action based on diversity.
The first was a doctor from the Western District of State C. The second
was a nurse from the Eastern District of State C.

In which judicial districts would venue be proper for the woman's
action?

(A) The Eastern District of State B.

(B) The Southern District of State A and the Eastern District of State B.

(C) The Western District of State C and the Eastern District of State C.

(D) The Eastern District of State B, the Western District of State C, and

the Eastern District of State C.

49. The defendant was employed by an attorney to clean his office and to
sweep the parking lot every night. While sweeping one evening, the
defendant found the attorney's wallet where he had dropped it in the
parking lot. The wallet contained $300. Planning to return it to the
attorney the next morning, the defendant took the wallet home for
safekeeping. That night, however, realizing that nobody knew that she
had it. the defendant decided to keep the attorney's wallet. She went out
and spent $4 of the attorney's money on ice cream. The following
morning, the defendant felt guilty about keeping the attorney's money.
She replaced what she had spent and returned the wallet and cash to
the attorney.

If the defendant is prosecuted for crimes resulting from the above
incident, she may properly be convicted of

1113

(A) larceny only.

(B) embezzlement only.

(C) neither larceny nor embezzlement.

(D) larceny and embezzlement.

50. The defendant purchased property in a popular resort area and

constructed a restaurant on it. The defendant's restaurant was equipped
with a walk-up window so that people who chose to do so could
purchase food and soft drinks without entering the restaurant. The
defendant kept his restaurant and walk-up window open every night
until 2 A.M. Soon, large noisy crowds of young people began
congregating in front of the defendant's restaurant, making occasional
purchases at the walk-up window and remaining there until it closed.
On many nights, members of the crowd openly smoked marijuana and
used profane language in loud voices. The plaintiff, who resided in a
house next to the restaurant, telephoned the defendant. The plaintiff
complained that the value of his home was being diminished by the
walk-up window and by noise from the restaurant. He asked the
defendant to close the restaurant each night at 11 P.M., but the defendant
refused.

If the plaintiff subsequently asserts a claim against the defendant for
damages resulting from the reduction of his home's value, which of the
following theories would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
plaintiff?

(A) Trespass to land.

(B) Intentional infliction of emotional distress.

(C) Private nuisance.

(D) Invasion of privacy.

51. Because of severe economic recession, the state has enacted a statute

imposing a tax on corporations that have gross sales within the state in
excess of $1 million during a calendar year. The statute applies to all
such corporations, whether incorporated inside or outside the state. It
establishes a sliding-scale tax schedule with a maximum tax rate of 10
percent of gross sales in excess of $1 million.

Which of the following persons or entities is most likely to have

1114

standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on the ground
that it violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution?

(A) The governor of a neighboring state.

(B) The stockholders of a state corporation with annual gross sales of

$1.5 million in the state.

(C) The stockholders of an out-of-state corporation with annual gross

sales of $500,000 in the state.

(D) A taxpayer in the state.

52. When the landowner died, she left a one-half interest in a parcel of
realty to her niece and the niece's husband, as joint tenants with full
right of survivorship, and a one-half interest in the realty to the 13-
year-old unmarried daughter of the landowner. One year later, the
niece, the husband, and the daughter were killed simultaneously in an
automobile accident.

Which of the following statements correctly describes ownership of
the realty following their deaths?

(A) The heirs of the daughter hold a one-half interest, the heirs of the

niece hold a one-quarter interest, and the heirs of the husband hold
a one-quarter interest.

(B) The entire property is held by the heirs of the daughter.

(C) The heirs of the daughter hold a one-third interest, the heirs of the
niece hold a one-third interest, and the heirs of the husband hold a
one-third interest.

(D) The heirs of the niece hold a one-half interest and the heirs of the

husband hold a one-half interest.

53. The landowner was the owner of a large tract of realty located in a

heavily forested area. In January 2012, the landowner leased the realty
to a friend for a period of 20 years. In March 2012, the landowner sold
the realty to an artist, executing a general warranty deed containing
covenants of seisin, quiet enjoyment, the right to convey, and a
covenant against encumbrances. In April 2012, the artist conveyed the
realty to a baker by a deed containing covenants substantially identical
to those contained in the deed that the artist had received from the
landowner. In May 2012, the artist became insolvent. In June 2012, the
baker attempted to move onto the realty and was prevented from doing

1115

so by the friend, who claimed a superior right.

If the baker subsequently asserts a claim for damages against the
landowner, the baker's most effective theory would be that the
landowner breached the warranty

(A) of seisin.

(B) against encumbrances.

(C) of the right to convey.

(D) of quiet enjoyment.

54. The defendant was the operator of a summer camp for children. The
plaintiff was a nine-year-old child staying at the camp, her parents
having paid the defendant a fee. The plaintiff was playing softball with
other children on a field that the defendant set aside for this purpose.
When one of the children hit the ball, it rolled into a group of bushes
alongside the field. Running into the bushes after the ball, the plaintiff
tripped on a tree root that was covered by a pile of leaves. The tree
root would have been discovered and removed by a reasonable
summer camp operator.

The plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant, alleging that the
defendant's negligence was a proximate cause of injuries that the
plaintiff sustained when she tripped on the tree root. The court should
find for

(A) the defendant, because the tree root was a natural condition of the

land.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff assumed the risk by chasing the

ball into the grove of bushes.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant owed her an absolute duty to

keep the premises safe.

(D) the plaintiff, because a reasonable person in the defendant's
position would have discovered and removed the tree root.

55. The seller owned a 10-acre parcel of realty. On March 6, the seller

offered to sell the land to the buyer for $80,000. The buyer said that he
might be interested but that he would not be in a position to make up
his mind until July. The seller said that she would hold the realty for
the buyer until then and signed a paper on which she wrote:

1116

I  hereby  offer  to  sell  Blackacre  to  the  buyer  for  $80,000  cash.  In
return  for  $1  that  I  have  on  this  date  received,  I  promise  to  hold  this
offer open until July 15.

On July 1, the buyer told the seller that he was ready to purchase the
land, but the seller told him that she had changed her mind and did not
want to sell. The buyer asserted a claim against the seller based on her
written promise to keep the offer open until July 15. At the trial, the
seller proved that she never actually received $1 from the buyer in
return for her promise. In deciding the buyer's claim, the court should
find for

(A) the buyer, because the parol evidence rule prevents the seller from
relying on oral evidence that she did not actually receive $1.

(B) the buyer, because the buyer detrimentally relied on the seller's

promise to keep the offer open until July 15.

(C) the seller, because the realty is obviously worth more than $1.

(D) the seller, because nothing was bargained for or given in exchange

for the seller's promise to keep the offer open until July 15.

56. A woman sued a company in federal district court in State A. She

claimed that she had been injured by one of the company's products and
could no longer work. The company's attorney did not believe the
woman was as injured as she claimed and would like to have the
woman physically examined by a doctor.

What should the company's attorney do?

(A) File notice of request to take a physical examination.

(B) Serve the woman with a notice of deposition.

(C) Obtain a court order requiring the woman to undergo an

examination.

(D) Subpoena the woman to appear at a physical examination.

57. The plaintiff, who was four years of age, was the plaintiff in a battery
action against the defendant, who was seven years of age. At trial, the
plaintiff's attorney called the plaintiff to testify on the plaintiff's direct
case. After interviewing her, the trial judge ruled that because of the
plaintiff's youth, she was unable to appreciate her duty to testify
truthfully and therefore was not a competent witness. The plaintiff's

1117

attorney subsequently called a witness, the plaintiff's neighbor. The
witness testified that, immediately after the incident in question, the
plaintiff had come running up to her on the street, crying and with her
nose bleeding. The witness testified further that at that time the plaintiff
said, “The defendant pushed me and gave me a bloody nose.”

If the defendant's attorney objects to the witness's statement about what
the plaintiff said to her, the court should rule that evidence

(A) admissible as an excited utterance.

(B) admissible because the plaintiff's incompetence to testify made her

a presently unavailable declarant.

(C) inadmissible because it is hearsay.

(D) inadmissible because the plaintiff was incompetent to testify.

58. The plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for injuries that the

plaintiff received when she was struck by a truck owned by the
defendant and driven by one of the defendant's employees. At trial, the
plaintiff's attorney called a woman as a witness on the presentation of
the plaintiff's direct case. In response to questions asked by the
plaintiff's attorney, the witness stated that she was presently employed
by the defendant and that she had been driving the defendant's truck on
the day of the accident. The plaintiff's attorney then asked, “You were
going faster than 35 miles per hour, weren't you?” The defendant's
attorney objected to the question on the ground that it was leading.

If the objection of the defendant's attorney is overruled, it will
probably be because

(A) the witness is employed by an adverse party.

(B) the witness is a hostile witness.

(C) leading questions are permitted on cross-examination.

(D) the question was not leading.

59. The defendant, the owner of a gasoline delivery service, operated a

tank truck for delivering gasoline. The defendant's truck was 35 feet in
length and had the words “DANGER — GASOLINE” printed on it.
One day, while on the way to a gasoline delivery, the defendant
stopped at a bank. Although she saw an official sign that prohibited
parking in that location, the defendant parked her truck directly in front

1118

of the bank. A statute in the jurisdiction prohibited parking any vehicle
longer than 30 feet on a city street. Another statute prohibited parking
any vehicle directly in front of a bank. The defendant was aware of
both statutes.

While the defendant was in the bank, a driver, who was driving down
the street, lost control of her car and struck the defendant's truck. As a
result, a large quantity of gasoline in the defendant's delivery tank
exploded, injuring the driver. The plaintiff, a bank employee who was
sitting at his desk inside the bank, was also injured in the explosion.

The plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for his injuries. If
the plaintiff's claim is successful, it will most likely be because

(A) the statute that prohibited parking vehicles longer than 30 feet on a

city street was a traffic safety statute.

(B) the defendant was aware that a statute prohibited parking any

vehicle in front of a bank.

(C) the reasonable person would not park a vehicle in violation of an

official sign that prohibits parking.

(D) transporting large quantities of gasoline is an abnormally dangerous

activity.

60. A seven-year-old girl was admitted to a hospital unconscious. Doctors

who examined her asked the girl's parents to consent to a blood
transfusion for the girl, stating that the girl would probably die
otherwise. The girl's parents refused, saying that they did not believe in
blood transfusions.

A state statute provides that if a child is admitted to a hospital with a
life-threatening disease or injury, and the parents of that child refuse to
consent to treatment that in the opinion of hospital officials is
necessary to save the child's life, the court shall designate the hospital
administrator to act as the child's guardian for the purpose of
consenting to such treatment. The hospital administrator immediately
commenced a proceeding in a state court to have herself declared the
girl's guardian under that statute. The girl's parents petitioned a federal
court to enjoin the state court from granting the hospital administrator's
application on the ground that the state law is unconstitutional on its
face. Prior to the disposition of either proceeding, the girl died.

1119

If the statute is found to be unconstitutional, it will most likely be
because the statute

(A) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) is vague.

(C) violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

(D) interferes with a fundamental right.

61. After a man died without a will, the state treasurer instituted a

proceeding for a declaration that the man's assets should escheat to the
state, on the ground that there were no living persons eligible to inherit.
A woman opposed the proceeding, claiming that she was the man's
niece and therefore his heir under the state law of intestate distribution.
In support of her claim, the niece offered a Bible. She testified that the
Bible had belonged to her deceased mother, and that her mother had
made notations in it indicating that her husband, the niece's father, was
the man's brother, and indicating the date of birth of her daughter, the
niece. The state treasurer objected to admission of the Bible.

If the notation in the Bible is admitted into evidence, it will probably
be as

(A) an ancient document.

(B) a statement of the mother's personal history or pedigree.

(C) a transaction recorded under the “dead man's statute.”

(D) a record of vital statistics.

62. The defendant and his friend agreed to rob a bank and planned the

robbery for several weeks. According to their plan, the defendant's car
would be used as the getaway vehicle. The defendant was to drive to
and from the robbery and wait in the car while his friend went into the
bank to hold it up. While driving to the bank with his friend on the day
the robbery was to take place, however, the defendant began to have
second thoughts. After a brief conversation with his friend, the
defendant stopped the car. Taking his car keys with him, he told his
friend he wasn't going through with it and went into a store, where he
telephoned the police and told them about the planned robbery. While
the defendant was in the store, his friend left and robbed the bank
himself. The information provided by the defendant's call led to the
apprehension and conviction of his friend.

1120

If the defendant is subsequently arrested and prosecuted for conspiracy
to commit bank robbery, he should be found

(A) not guilty, because he removed his keys from the car when he got

out to phone the police.

(B) not guilty, because he notified his friend that he had changed his

mind about going through with the plan.

(C) not guilty, because the defendant's telephone call to the police led

to the apprehension and conviction of his friend.

(D) guilty.

63. The defendant was the owner and operator of a hotel. Because
electrical wiring in the hotel was beginning to deteriorate, the
defendant hired a licensed electrician to repair it. The electrician was
hired as an independent contractor. If the defendant had done any
investigation regarding the electrician, he would have discovered many
complaints and citations regarding poor work done by the electrician.
While repairing the wiring, the electrician negligently connected the
wiring in room 201 to a dangerous high-voltage supply line instead of
to a safe low-voltage supply line. Reasonable inspection by the
defendant would not have disclosed the error. The following day, when
the plaintiff registered at the hotel, the defendant assigned him to room
201. That evening, while the plaintiff was attempting to adjust the
electric heater in room 201, he received a severe electric shock as a
result of the fact that the room had been connected to a high-voltage
supply line.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damage
resulting from the electric shock, the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the defendant hired the electrician as an

independent contractor.

(B) the defendant, because reasonable inspection by the defendant

would have failed to disclose the electrician's error.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant failed to use adequate care in

hiring the electrician.

(D) the plaintiff, because the electrician's error made the wiring in

room 201 ultra-hazardous.

64. When the landowner's mother died, she left him a 640-acre parcel of

1121

realty known as the Smith and Baker tract. Soon afterwards, the
landowner executed a general warranty deed to his sister, conveying
realty described as “the north 40 of the parcel of land known as the
Smith and Baker tract.” The landowner thereafter executed a quitclaim
deed in favor of his wife to “all my rights, title, and interest in a parcel
of realty known as the Smith and Baker tract.” The Smith and Baker
tract was a famous piece of land in the area, and was easily
identifiable by its name. However, the jurisdiction was one in which
reference to government survey markers was customarily used in
describing realty in general warranty deeds. If the wife subsequently
institutes a proceeding against the sister seeking to declare herself the
owner of the entire Smith and Baker tract, should the court grant the
relief requested by the wife?

(A) No, because one who executes a quitclaim deed does not warrant

that he or she holds any interest in the property described.

(B) No, because the description in the landowner's deed to the sister
was reasonably sufficient to identify the property conveyed.

(C) Yes, because the jurisdiction is one in which reference to

government survey markers is customarily used in describing realty
in general warranty deeds.

(D) Yes, because a deed that conveys a portion of a parcel of realty

must describe the portion conveyed in terms of “metes and bounds”
or other survey terminology.

65. A newspaper published an article stating that the plaintiff had once

been convicted of armed robbery. In fact, the plaintiff had never been
convicted of any crime. If the plaintiff asserts a defamation claim
against the newspaper, which one of the following additional facts or
inferences, if it was the only one true, would be most likely to result in
a judgment for the newspaper?

(A) Official government records indicating that the plaintiff had never

been convicted of robbery were available for public inspection.

(B) Officials of the newspaper responsible for publishing the article

reasonably believed the statement to be true.

(C) The plaintiff was a public figure.

(D) The plaintiff failed to prove that damage resulted from the

statement.

1122

66. A woman was the owner of a house in which she lived with her 23-

year-old son, the defendant. After receiving a tip that the defendant was
involved in the unlawful sale of drugs, two police officers went to the
woman's home for the purpose of questioning the defendant. When they
arrived, the defendant was not in, but the woman admitted them to the
house. The officers explained why they had come and asked whether
they could see the defendant's room. The woman showed them to the
defendant's room and permitted them to enter, saying that the defendant
never locked his door. When the officers saw a footlocker in the room,
they asked the woman whether they could look inside it. She told them
that the defendant was the only one who had a key to the footlocker, but
she said if they could find some way to open it, she had no objection to
their looking inside. While the woman watched, one of the officers
picked the lock and opened the footlocker. In it, they found a plastic
bag containing cocaine. The officers left the plastic bag there and
returned later with a search warrant that they obtained by swearing that
they had seen cocaine in the defendant's footlocker. After seizing the
cocaine, they arrested the defendant for unlawful possession of a
dangerous drug. Prior to trial, the defendant asked the court to suppress
use of the cocaine as evidence.

The defendant's motion should be

(A) denied, because the woman gave the police permission to open the

footlocker.

(B) denied, because the woman had apparent authority to permit the

search of the defendant's room.

(C) granted.

(D) denied, because the officers had probable cause to believe that they

would find cocaine in the footlocker.

67. After negotiation, the buyer and the seller entered into a valid written
contract for the sale to the buyer of the seller's realty. The contract
provided for closing of title “on or before June 15” because the buyer
was moving into the area on June 15 and needed to move into the realty
immediately. The contract also stated that “time is of the essence.” On
June 12, the seller informed the buyer that she would not be able to
close until June 16. On June 16, the seller tendered a conveyance.
Although the seller complied with the requirements of the contract in
all other respects, the buyer refused to accept the conveyance on the

1123

ground that the date for performance had passed.

If the seller asserts a claim against the buyer as a result of the buyer's
refusal to accept the seller's conveyance on June 16, the court should
find for

(A) the buyer, because circumstances contemplated by the parties at the
time the contract was formed made it essential that the conveyance
occur on or before June 15.

(B) the buyer, because the contract contained the phrase “time is of the

essence.”

(C) the seller, because there was no indication that a conveyance after

June 15 would cause damages to the buyer.

(D) the seller, because she made a reasonable effort to comply with the

terms of the contract.

68. The defendant was the manufacturer of a gas sold for commercial use.
The defendant produced the gas at its factory and stored it in a large
tank located behind the factory building. Although the defendant made
reasonable inspections of its storage tank at reasonable intervals, a
leak in the tank allowed some gas to escape. A wind carried the
escaped gas to the home of the plaintiff, located a half-mile from the
defendant's factory. The plaintiff died as a result of his exposure to the
gas.

In a strict liability claim against the defendant for damages resulting
from the plaintiff's exposure to gas, which of the following must the
plaintiff's personal representative prove to prevail?

(A) The tank in which the defendant stored the gas was defective.

(B) The gas was defectively designed.

(C) The gas was defectively manufactured.

(D) The gas is extremely deadly.

69. After a man died in a plane crash, the man's family sued the airline in
federal district court. The family's attorney hired an expert in airplane
accidents to create a model of the man's accident. Based on his
research, the expert planned to testify that the accident was caused by
pilot negligence.

1124

The airline's attorney would like to know the details of the expert's
research before trial. How may the airline's attorney do so?

(A) The airline's attorney doesn't have to do anything to learn the

details of the expert's research.

(B) The airline's attorney may serve interrogatories on the expert.

(C) The airline's attorney may depose the expert.

(D) The airline's attorney may not know the details of the expert's

research because it is protected work product.

70. The plaintiff asserted a negligence claim against the defendant for
personal injuries sustained when the plaintiff fell down a stairway
while leaving the defendant's restaurant. The defendant asserted a
defense of contributory negligence. At trial, the defendant's attorney
called a witness. After answering several preliminary questions, the
witness testified that she observed the plaintiff leaving the restaurant
just before the accident and that the plaintiff appeared to be
intoxicated. The witness said she based her opinion on the fact she
heard the plaintiff slurring her words and the plaintiff appeared to
almost walk into a wall. The plaintiff's attorney objected, and the judge
found that the witness's opinion appeared to be rationally based on the
witness's personal perceptions. The witness's statement that the
plaintiff appeared to be intoxicated should be

(A) admitted.

(B) excluded, because the witness is not an expert on intoxication.

(C) admitted, but the judge should instruct the jury to disregard it unless

the jury decides that the witness is an expert on intoxication.

(D) admitted, but the judge should instruct the jury to disregard it unless
the jury decides that the witness's opinion is rationally based on
her personal perceptions.

71. The Department of Sanitation was established for the purpose of

providing free sanitation services to the people of the state. Since its
inception, the Department's activities have included garbage collection
and street cleaning. The plaintiff, an alien residing within the state,
applied for a job as a Director of Public Policy with the Department of
Sanitation. The Director had broad discretion regarding policies in the
Department of Sanitation. Although he qualified in all other respects,
the state Personnel Division rejected the plaintiff's application on the

1125

sole ground that he was not a United States citizen. A statute of the state
provides in part that “no person shall be eligible for employment as
Director of Public Policy in the Department of Sanitation who is not a
citizen of the United States.” The plaintiff challenged the
constitutionality of that statute in an appropriate proceeding.

The statute should be found constitutional

(A) because street cleaning is a traditional government activity in the

state.

(B) because there is a rational basis for restricting employment by the

state to citizens of the United States.

(C) because the job the plaintiff applied for appears to involve policy-
making functions and includes broad discretion in the execution of
public policy.

(D) unless employment by the state is found to be a fundamental right.

72. A shoe company sued an athlete in federal district court in State A. The

case was tried in front of a jury.

Which of the following statements is correct?

(A) The jury must have at least five members.

(B) The jury can have no more than nine members.

(C) A jury can hear the case if the company seeks an injunction.

(D) The jury verdict must be unanimous.

73. A woman, a citizen of State A, sued a company for violations of the

federal National Labor Relations Act in federal district court in State
A. The company was incorporated in State B and had most of its
factories in State A (including the factory where the woman's claim
arose). The company president and most of its decision-makers
worked in an office in State C just across the border from State B. The
woman claimed $80,000 in damages.

Does the federal district court in State A have subject matter
jurisdiction over the claim?

(A) No, because most of the company's factories are in State A.

(B) No, because the woman's claim arose from a company factory in

1126

State A.

(C) Yes, because the woman is suing under the National Labor

Relations Act.

(D) Yes, because the company president and most of its decision-

makers work in an office in State C.

74. The defendant kept a pet cougar in a yard that was surrounded by a
wire chain-link fence. The plaintiff, who lived in the vicinity,
frequently walked on the public sidewalk adjacent to the defendant's
yard. One day, while the plaintiff was standing on the public sidewalk
looking at the cougar through the defendant's fence, the cougar sprang
toward the plaintiff. Because the fence was badly deteriorated, it
collapsed under the cougar's weight and fell on the plaintiff, inflicting
serious injuries. The defendant knew the fence was in need of repair.

If the plaintiff asserts a negligence claim against the defendant as a
result of her injuries, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the keeping of a wild animal is prima facie

negligent.

(B) the plaintiff, because a reasonable person in the defendant's

position would have repaired the fence.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant knew that the fence was in need

of repair.

(D) the defendant, because the plaintiff assumed the risk by standing by

the fence and looking at the cougar.

75. On March 1, a farmer entered into a written contract with the worker.
By its terms, the worker agreed to plow the farmer's fields by April 1,
using the worker's own tractor. In return, the farmer promised to pay
$2,000 upon completion of the work. On March 25, while the worker
was plowing the farmer's field, her tractor broke down. The worker
informed the farmer that because the tractor needed extensive repairs,
it would be impossible to finish the job by April 1 unless she rented
another tractor. The worker said that she could rent one for $600, but
she would not do so unless the farmer agreed to add the rental charge
to the worker's fee for preparing the field. The farmer agreed without
complaint, afraid that the value of his crop would be reduced if the
field was not plowed in time. The worker returned to work after
renting a tractor for $600.

1127

After the worker finished plowing the farmer's field, however, the
farmer refused to pay her any more than $2,000.

If the worker asserts a claim against the farmer on account of the
farmer's promise to pay an additional $600 for the rental of a tractor,
which of the following would be the farmer's most effective argument
in defense?

(A) The farmer's promise to pay for the tractor rental was not in

writing.

(B) The farmer's promise to pay for the tractor rental was unsupported

by consideration.

(C) The farmer's promise to pay for the tractor rental was induced by

economic duress.

(D) The farmer detrimentally relied on the worker's original promise to
complete plowing of the field by April 1 at a price of $2,000.

76. A landowner conveyed a parcel of land “to my son for life, remainder
to my daughter.” Two years later, without the landowner's permission,
the son quitclaimed all of his interest in the land to his wife.

What is the state of the land's title?

(A) Life estate in daughter, remainder in fee simple to landowner.

(B) Fee simple absolute in daughter.

(C) Life estate per autre vie in wife, remainder in fee simple in

daughter.

(D) Life estate in wife, remainder in fee simple in daughter.

77. A man went to a car dealer. The dealer showed him a car that he said

was “brand new.” The man checked the odometer, which showed it had
been driven 10 miles, and checked the interior and engine, which
looked new. After the man bought the car for $2,000 less than the
suggested list price, he discovered the car was actually a used car that
had been completely submerged in a flood. On further investigation, he
learned the car dealer had rolled back the odometer back from 10,000
miles and had covered up the flood damage with paint.

What crime, if any, can the car dealer be charged with?

(A) Larceny by trick.

1128

(B) False pretenses.

(C) Embezzlement.

(D) No crime.

78. In determining what law to apply in a case brought in federal court
based on diversity, which of the following statements is incorrect?

(A) A court of appeals should defer to a district court's decision

regarding unsettled state law.

(B) A district court should apply the substantive law of the state in

which it sits.

(C) A district court should apply federal procedural law.

(D) A district court should apply the statute of limitations rules of the

state in which it sits.

79. A police officer was walking by a home when he heard screaming. The
officer ran to the front door, announced himself, and then entered the
house. When he went into the kitchen, the officer saw a large amount of
cocaine and a scale sitting in an open kitchen cupboard. He placed
both of the men under arrest.

At their trial for drug crimes, the men argued that the court should
suppress the evidence against them because their arrests were the
result of a warrantless search. What result?

(A) The evidence should be suppressed because the warrantless entry

violated the men's Fourth Amendment rights.

(B) The evidence should not be suppressed because the officer could
enter the premises without a warrant based on the plain view
doctrine.

(C) The evidence should not be suppressed because there were exigent

circumstances supporting the officer's warrantless entry.

(D) The evidence should not be suppressed because there was

probable cause for the officer to enter the premises to make the
arrests.

80. A lumber supplier entered into a contract with a new home builder.
The contract stated that the builder would purchase all the wood
required by the builder for new homes he was building in 2013, but

1129

that in no event would the amount be less than 20,000 board-feet of
wood. In making the agreement, neither party contemplated a decline in
new home starts. After the agreement, new home starts fell
dramatically. As a result, the builder informed the supplier he would
not be ordering any wood in 2013.

The supplier sued the builder for damages. At trial, the builder tried to
testify that in the home-building industry it was generally understood
that minimum requirements set forth in contracts for the supply of
wood were of no effect when new home starts fell dramatically. The
supplier objected. Should the builder's testimony be admitted?

(A) Yes, because evidence of a regularly observed business practice
may be offered to explain the terms of a written agreement.

(B) No, because the written agreement was intended by the parties to

be a final expression of their agreement.

(C) No, because the parties did not contemplate a decline in new home

starts.

(D) No, because the fact that the parties specified a minimum

requirement of 20,000 board-feet shows that they did not intend to
be bound by any preexisting industry standards.

81. A local newspaper published an editorial claiming that the majority of
firefighters at the local fire department were dangerously out of shape
and had recently failed their physicals. Following publication, several
firefighters sued the newspaper for defamation.

All parties agree that the newspaper lacked actual malice in making
the statement and that this is the only defense raised by the newspaper.
Which of the following arguments would be most likely to result in a
judgment for the newspaper?

(A) There is no such thing as a false idea.

(B) The plaintiffs were in a position of apparent control over public

affairs.

(C) The editorial and resulting lawsuit made the public familiar with

the plaintiffs.

(D) The plaintiffs were public employees.

82. The plaintiff, a manufacturer of police equipment, obtained a patent for

1130

a bulletproof vest made entirely of recycled aluminum cans. On April
1, a police department entered into a written contract with the plaintiff
providing for the purchase and sale of 30 of the plaintiff's bulletproof
vests per month for the next year at a specified price. For the following
three months, both parties performed as required by the agreement. On
July 5, soon after the third delivery, the plaintiff's only factory burned
completely to the ground without any fault on the part of the plaintiff.
On July 10, officials of the police department wrote to the plaintiff,
asking whether the plaintiff would continue to deliver as agreed. When
the plaintiff failed to respond within a reasonable time, the police
department entered into an agreement with another company for the
purchase of 30 bulletproof vests per month.

After the police department contracted with another company for the
purchase of bulletproof vests, the plaintiff delivered 30 bulletproof
vests to the police department, but the police department refused to
accept them. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the police
department for breach of contract, which of the following would be the
police department's most effective argument in defense against that
claim?

(A) The destruction of the plaintiff's factory reasonably appeared to

frustrate the purpose of the contract between the police department
and the plaintiff.

(B) The plaintiff's failure to respond to the police department's letter of

July 10 resulted in a prospective inability to perform.

(C) The plaintiff's contract with the police department was divisible.

(D) The police department's contract to purchase bulletproof vests from

another company was a repudiation of its contract with the
plaintiff.

83. A group of teenagers hired a stretch limousine for their prom. While

driving to the prom, the limousine driver saw a dog crossing the road
in front of the vehicle. He swerved to avoid it and ended up crashing
into a tree. Several of the teenagers were injured. A state statute
required that all limousine drivers carry at least a $100,000 minimum
accident liability policy. The limousine driver was uninsured. If the
limousine driver is found liable for the teenagers' injuries, it will be

(A) under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, because an accident like

this would not normally occur without negligence.

1131

(B) under the doctrine of negligence per se, because the driver

violated the state insurance statute.

(C) because his conduct in swerving to avoid the dog was

unreasonable.

(D) because he owed a special duty to the teenagers in his care.

84. At the defendant's trial on criminal charges, undisputed evidence
established that the defendant and his friend had planned to take a
certain coat from the victim's shop by threatening the victim with a
pistol carried by the friend; that when they did so, the victim began
shooting at them; and that the friend shot back with his pistol,
intentionally killing the victim.

Testifying on behalf of the prosecution, the friend stated that the
defendant knew that the friend's pistol would be loaded. He also stated
that the victim had handed the defendant the coat; that the friend had
returned his own gun to his pocket; and that he and the defendant were
on their way out of the victim's shop when the victim began shooting at
them.

The defendant testified that the coat in question had previously been
stolen from her by the victim, and that she and the friend were trying to
retrieve it.

Statutes in the jurisdiction define first degree murder as the intentional
unlawful killing of a human being, and second degree murder as the
unintentional killing of a human being by the defendant or an
accomplice during the course of a burglary, robbery, rape, kidnapping,
or arson committed by the defendant.

The jury believes the testimony of the defendant but does not believe
the testimony of the friend. Which of the following would be the
defendant's most effective argument in defense against a charge of
second degree murder?

(A) It was unforeseeable that the victim would begin shooting.

(B) The defendant did not know that the friend's pistol would be

loaded.

(C) The victim's death did not occur during the course of one of the

1132

crimes specified in the applicable statute.

(D) The statute was not intended to impose criminal liability on one

person for the acts of another.

85. On February 1, the landowner conveyed a parcel of realty to his cousin
as a gift. The landowner executed the deed in the presence of a notary
public, and the notary affixed his seal as required by law. On March 1,
after the landowner learned that his cousin had not recorded his title,
the landowner purported to convey the same parcel of realty to his
barber for value. The barber was unaware that the landowner's cousin
held any interest in the realty. On March 15, the landowner's cousin
recorded the deed that he had received from the landowner in
February. On March 17, the barber recorded his deed. In June, the
barber executed a deed conveying the realty to the notary. The notary
immediately recorded the deed.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “Every conveyance of real
estate which shall not be recorded is void as against any subsequent
purchaser of the same real estate in good faith and for a valuable
consideration whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.” In
litigation between the landowner's cousin and the notary, who should
be declared owner of the realty?

(A) The notary, because the landowner's cousin did not purchase the

realty from the landowner for value.

(B) The notary, because the barber recorded his deed prior to

conveying the realty to the notary.

(C) The landowner's cousin, because the barber recorded his deed after

the landowner's cousin recorded his deed.

(D) The landowner's cousin, because any recording by the barber was

outside the chain of title.

86. One night, the defendant looked out his window and saw a robber

taking something from his garage. The defendant went outside with a
pistol and saw that the robber was already backing down the
defendant's driveway in his getaway car. The defendant yelled, “Stop
or I'll shoot you right through the windshield!” The robber stopped and
started to get out of the car with a large axe in his hand. Before the
robber could get to his feet, the defendant shot the robber in the head,
killing him instantly. The defendant was charged with manslaughter. At

1133

trial, the defendant claimed he acted in self-defense. If the defendant is
found guilty of manslaughter, it will because

(A) the harm being defended against was not reasonably imminent.

(B) the defendant used more force than necessary.

(C) the robber had already withdrawn.

(D) the defendant provoked the robber.

87. A man's brother went away for a week on business. The man agreed to
stay in his brother's apartment to watch his dogs. While he was staying
in the apartment, he smoked marijuana several times. The neighbors
called the police to complain about the marijuana smell and told the
police the owner was away. The police went to the apartment and
knocked on the door. When the man answered the door, the police
forced their way in. Once they entered the apartment, they immediately
saw a large amount of marijuana on the kitchen table and arrested the
man. At trial, the man argued that the search of the apartment was
unlawful and the marijuana should be suppressed.

How should the court rule?

(A) The evidence should be suppressed, because the man was staying

at the apartment for a week.

(B) The evidence should not be suppressed, because the police officers

saw the marijuana in plain view.

(C) The evidence should not be suppressed, because the neighbors

smelled the marijuana.

(D) The evidence should not be suppressed, because the man did not

own the apartment.

88. The landowner was the owner of a parcel of realty on which there

were several buildings and a gold mine. The landowner lived in one of
the buildings and personally worked the gold mine, earning a
comfortable living by selling the gold that he removed. The other
buildings were vacant. When the landowner died, his will devised the
realty “to my best friend, but if my best friend should die without issue
from his wife, to my accountant.” Soon after the landlord's death, the
landowner's friend entered into a contract with a mining company.
Pursuant to the contract, the company was to work the gold mine for 10
years and to pay the landowner's friend 50 percent of the gross

1134

proceeds from the sale of gold removed from the mine. In addition, the
landowner's friend leased all the buildings on the realty to the company
for 10 years for use by the company employees as living quarters. He
never had any children with his wife.

His wife died two years later, and the accountant then demanded that
the landowner's friend pay the accountant all funds that the friend
would subsequently receive from the company as proceeds of the
company's gold mining operation on the realty and as rent on the
buildings. The accountant is entitled to receive

(A) proceeds of the gold mining operation only.

(B) rent on the buildings only.

(C) proceeds of the gold mining operation and rent on the buildings.

(D) neither the proceeds of the gold mining operation nor rent on the

buildings.

89. A concert promoter sued a rock singer for breach of contract in federal
district court after the rock singer failed to perform at a charity concert
in State A. The federal district court ruled in favor of the rock singer,
finding his signature had been forged on the contract. The concert
promoter appealed, arguing the signature was really the rock singer's.

What standard of review should the appellate court use?

(A) De novo, because the validity of the signature is a question of law.

(B) Clearly erroneous, because the validity of the signature is a

question of fact.

(C) Abuse of discretion, because the validity of the signature is a

question of law.

(D) Abuse of discretion, because the validity of the signature is a

question of fact.

90. At the defendant's trial on a charge of rape, the victim testified that on
March 1, the defendant forced her to have sexual intercourse with him
against her will. Testifying in his own defense, the defendant admitted
that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim on that date,
but he claimed that the victim had consented. The defendant stated
further that the victim had not accused him of rape until April 3, when
she discovered that he was married and was living with his wife.

1135

The prosecutor subsequently called the victim's neighbor to the stand.
The neighbor testified that while she was conversing with the victim
on March 7, the victim suddenly burst into tears and told her that she
had been raped by the defendant a week before. Upon objection by the
defendant's attorney, the neighbor's statement should be

(A) admitted, because the victim's statement was an excited utterance.

(B) excluded, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

(C) admitted, because it contradicts the defendant's claim that the

victim did not accuse him of rape until she learned that he was
married.

(D) admitted, because the victim's statement was a present sense

impression.

91. A woman was the owner of a parcel of realty on which she lived with
her husband. The woman was admitted to a hospital following a severe
heart attack. While her husband was visiting her in the hospital, the
woman said, “I know I'm dying, and I want to be sure that you have the
land after I'm gone. Please have our lawyer take care of it.” The
following day, the husband asked the family attorney to prepare a
quitclaim deed to the land for execution by the woman. The husband
brought the document to the woman in the hospital, where she executed
it according to the requirements of law. After signing the quitclaim
deed, the woman handed the document to the husband and said, “Please
put it in the safe deposit box at the bank.” The husband did so but never
recorded the quitclaim.

The woman subsequently recovered from her heart attack and was
moved from the hospital to a rest home, where she resided until 30
years later, when she died from other causes. At the woman's request,
the husband continued to occupy, maintain, and pay taxes on the land
throughout that period of time. During the last nine years of her life in
the rest home, the woman was attended by a nurse. When the woman
died, her will purported to leave the land “to my faithful nurse.” The
husband and the nurse subsequently asserted conflicting claims to the
land.

Which of the following arguments would be most likely to lead to a
judgment for the nurse?

(A) The husband did not record the quitclaim.

1136

(B) A quitclaim deed is relevant only in disputes between grantor and

grantee.

(C) No warranties of seisin or quiet enjoyment are created by a

quitclaim deed.

(D) The woman did not intend for the quitclaim to be effective until

after her death.

92. A boy decided to play a prank on his babysitter. He took one of his

play swords and swung it at his babysitter's head, acting like he was
going to hit her (although he had no intention of doing so). The
babysitter raised her arms in defense. At the same moment, the boy's
little sister walked out of the bathroom, saw her brother swinging the
sword, and ducked, thinking she was about to be hit by the sword. Due
to a manufacturing defect in the sword, the blade flew off and struck
the babysitter in the head. Which statement is most correct?

(A) The boy could not be held liable for battery of the babysitter

because he did not have the necessary intent.

(B) The boy's sister could claim assault under the doctrine of

transferred intent.

(C) Since the boy only intended to frighten the babysitter, he did not

have the necessary intent for assault.

(D) Because the boy did not bear malice or hostility toward the

babysitter, he could not be held liable for battery.

93. On March 1, the buyer, a well-known collector of antique automobiles,
mailed to a newspaper an advertisement that read, in part: “I will pay
$100 for information leading to purchase of an antique car.” On March
2, before the advertisement appeared in the newspaper and without
knowing about it, the seller phoned the buyer collect and offered to sell
him an antique car. The advertisement was published on March 3.

On March 3, a man saw the advertisement and remembered meeting
someone who owned an antique car. After calling a few friends, the
man obtained the owner's name and address and mailed it to the buyer
with a request for the $100 reward.

On March 4, the buyer looked at the seller's antique car and purchased
it. Later that day, the buyer mailed to the newspaper for publication a
second advertisement that in part read: “No reward for antique car. I

1137

hereby withdraw my previous request for information about an antique
car.” The second advertisement did not appear in the newspaper until
March 6.

On March 5, the buyer received the man's letter, but discarded it
because he had purchased the seller's antique car.

If the man asserts a claim against the buyer for $100, the court should
find for

(A) the buyer, because he mailed the second advertisement before

receiving the man's letter.

(B) the buyer, because the man's letter did not lead to the purchase of an

antique car.

(C) the man, because he mailed the letter to the buyer before the buyer

purchased an antique car.

(D) the man, because the buyer received the man's letter before the

second advertisement was published.

94. A man who suffered from severe skin allergies purchased a topical

cream online. A statute required the drug manufacturer to insert into the
cream's packaging a warning of its potential adverse side effects. The
manufacturer failed to insert an appropriate warning of a particular
side effect, skin discoloration, into the cream's packaging. The man
used the cream for several months until his skin began to turn a dark
blue color. Even though the man continued to use the cream, the man
sued. At trial, the man testified that neither he nor anyone in his
household ever read warnings that accompanied drugs.

How should the court rule?

(A) In favor of the manufacturer, because no one in the man's household

read drug warnings.

(B) In favor of the manufacturer, because the man continued to use the

cream.

(C) In favor of the man, because the manufacturer violated the statute by

failing to include the warning.

(D) In favor of the man, because the type of harm caused could have

been avoided by an adequate warning.

1138

95. A seven-year-old girl was admitted to a hospital unconscious. Doctors

who examined her asked the girl's parents to consent to a blood
transfusion for the girl, stating that the girl would probably die
otherwise. The girl's parents refused, saying that they did not believe in
blood transfusions.

A state statute provides that if a child is admitted to a hospital with a
life-threatening disease or injury, and the parents of that child refuse to
consent to treatment that in the opinion of hospital officials is
necessary to save the child's life, the court shall designate the hospital
administrator to act as the child's guardian for the purpose of
consenting to such treatment. The hospital administrator immediately
commenced a proceeding in a state court to have herself declared the
girl's guardian under that statute. The girl's parents petitioned a federal
court to enjoin the state court from granting the hospital administrator's
application on the ground that the state law is unconstitutional on its
face. Prior to the disposition of either proceeding, the girl died.

If the proceeding instituted by the girl's parents is dismissed, it will
most likely be because

(A) the girl's death has turned the controversy into a non-justiciable

political question.

(B) the girl's death has made the proceeding moot.

(C) the court lacks jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment.

(D) the issues are not ripe since the highest state court has not yet ruled

on the constitutionality of the statute.

96. Because of a deficit in the city budget, the city institutes a “pay-to-

throw” system where people must buy special trash bags if they want
to throw out their trash. The bags cost $2 a piece, and are burdensome
on low-income families. If a person or organization with standing
challenges the new system, its constitutionality will be based on

(A) whether the new system has a rational basis.

(B) whether it is necessary to serve a compelling interest of the state.

(C) whether it is found to interfere with a fundamental right.

(D) whether it is found to discriminate against a discrete class of

persons.

1139

97. A man was at the beach when he saw a small dog being washed out to
sea. He jumped into the ocean and rescued the dog. As soon as the man
and the dog were back on the beach, the dog's owner ran up to the man
and said, “That's my prize show dog! I promise to pay you $1,000 for
rescuing him!” The man accepted. In celebration, the man bought
himself a new motorcycle on credit based on his expected reward
money. Several months passed, and the man called the dog's owner to
ask when he might be paid so he could pay off the motorcycle. The dog
owner refused to pay the $1,000 he had promised, claiming it was
unsupported by any consideration. Which of the following would be
the man's most effective argument in support of his claim?

(A) The dog owner's promise was given in exchange for the man's

rescue of his dog.

(B) The dog owner was morally obligated to compensate the man for

rescuing his dog.

(C) Allowing the dog owner to avoid compensating the man for
rescuing the dog would unjustly enrich the dog owner.

(D) The man detrimentally relied on the dog owner's promise by buying

the motorcycle.

98. At the defendant's trial for murder, the prosecution proved that the

defendant was driving while intoxicated when his car struck another
car, killing all its occupants. The defendant appealed his conviction for
voluntary manslaughter.

Which of the cases below is most applicable as precedent?

(A) Believing that the victim was attacking her, the defendant swung a
tennis racket at the victim, hoping to frighten the victim away but
not meaning to strike the victim with it. The tennis racket struck the
victim in the head, causing his death. At the defendant's trial, over
the defendant's objection, the judge instructed the jury to find the
defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter if the force used by the
defendant was excessive. The defendant's conviction for
involuntary manslaughter was affirmed.

(B) The defendant's wife was admitted to the intensive care unit of a

hospital following an automobile accident. While visiting her, the
defendant overheard doctors saying that there was no hope of
saving the life of a certain patient who would be in intense pain

1140

and paralyzed for as long as she lived. Mistakenly believing that
they were talking about his wife, the defendant subsequently
smothered her to death with a pillow while she was asleep in the
hospital bed. The defendant was convicted of murder after the
court refused to charge the jury that if the defendant believed that
his wife was hopelessly ill and in intense pain, they could find him
guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The defendant's conviction for
murder was reversed.

(C) While the defendant was robbing a tavern, the bartender attempted

to grab the defendant's gun. During the struggle, the gun
accidentally went off, seriously injuring the bartender. At the
defendant's trial for attempted murder, the court instructed the jury
to return a verdict of not guilty if they found that the defendant did
not intend to cause the bartender's death. The defendant's acquittal
was affirmed.

(D) After the defendant quarreled with her lover, she fired a gun at him
while he was with his wife. The bullet missed the defendant's lover
but struck and killed his wife. At the defendant's trial, it was
established that she fired with the intention of frightening both her
lover and his wife, but that she did not mean to strike either of
them. The defendant was convicted of murder after the court
refused to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter. The
conviction was affirmed.

99. After receiving a warrant, police officers went to the defendant's

address to arrest him. They arrested the defendant on the street outside
his residence and placed him in a police car. The officers then knocked
on the front door of the house, and the defendant's girlfriend answered.
She gave the officers consent to search a back bedroom she shared
with the defendant “most of the time.” Inside the bedroom, the officers
found drugs and guns.

At trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence on the grounds
that his girlfriend had no authority to search the bedroom. How should
the court rule?

(A) Grant the motion, because the girlfriend only shared the bedroom

“most of the time.”

(B) Grant the motion, because by her statements it was clear she was

not the owner of the property.

1141

(C) Deny the motion, because the girlfriend had joint authority over the

bedroom.

(D) Deny the motion, because the police could reasonably believe she

could give consent to search the bedroom.

100. A buyer signed a sales contract to buy a new house from the seller. The
contract stated that it was “subject to and conditional upon the buyer
obtaining a 30-year mortgage from a bank or other lending institution
in the amount of $200,000 at an interest rate of less than 2 percent.”
The buyer went to several banks in the area, but no bank would lend
him the money at an interest rate of less than 2 percent. The seller
offered to set up a private financing plan between the two parties that
would bring the interest rate down to less than 2 percent for the buyer
over the course of the loan. The buyer refused to close the deal. The
seller argued that with the private financing in place, the net result of
the loan was the same and the contract should be enforced.

What is the result of the buyer's failure to obtain an interest rate of less
than 2 percent?

(A) The buyer is discharged from his duty to close the sale.

(B) Since the net result of the private financing is the same, the buyer is

required to close the sale.

(C) The seller can sue the buyer for specific performance to complete

the sale.

(D) The seller can sue the buyer for any damages he suffered under the
contract due to the buyer's failure to obtain a loan at less than 2
percent interest.

PRACTICE MBE — P.M. EXAM

PRACTICE MBE — P.M. QUESTIONS

101. The homeowner, who owned a home in a residential development,

decided to have his driveway paved. He called the plaintiff, a licensed
contractor who specialized in residential driveways, and asked for an
estimate on the job. Although the standard market price to pave a
driveway the size of the homeowner's was $2,750, the plaintiff was
willing to do the job for $2,500 since business was slow. The
homeowner agreed to hire him to do the job at that price and filled out
and signed a detailed work order for the plaintiff's work crew. Since
the 
homeowner was planning to go on vacation for two weeks, he and the
plaintiff agreed that the job would be finished by the time the
homeowner returned.

Three days later, the plaintiff's work crew went out to do the job
described in the homeowner's work order. By mistake, they paved the
neighbor's driveway, which was identical to the homeowner's except
that it was on a different street. The neighbor was out of town at the
time. The job cost the plaintiff $2,600 in labor and materials and
increased the value of the neighbor's realty by $2,100. The homeowner
did not communicate with the plaintiff while away on vacation. When
he returned and discovered that his driveway had not yet been paved,
he demanded that the plaintiff perform as agreed, but the plaintiff
refused.

The plaintiff asserts a claim against the neighbor on a quasi-contract
theory. If the plaintiff is successful, he is entitled to

(A) $2,100 (the increase in the value of the neighbor's realty).

(B) $2,500 (the agreed price in the contract between the plaintiff and

the homeowner).

1143

(C) $2,600 (the plaintiff's cost in paving the neighbor's driveway).

(D) $2,750 (the standard price of the paving job).

102. The plaintiff and the defendant, both residents of the state, entered into
an installment contract for the sale of goods. When a dispute arose
between them under the contract, the plaintiff asserted a claim for
$52,000 against the defendant in a United States district court in the
state. The defendant moved to dismiss the claim on jurisdictional
grounds. A state statute grants concurrent state and federal jurisdiction
over contract disputes, and a federal statute grants jurisdiction to hear
such a claim to the United States district court.

Did the United States district court have jurisdiction to adjudicate the
claim?

(A) Yes, because a statute of the state grants concurrent state and

federal jurisdiction over contract disputes.

(B) Yes, because a federal statute 

grants jurisdiction to hear such a claim to the United States district
court.

(C) No, under Article III of the United States Constitution.

(D) No, under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States

Constitution.

103. The company was a major corporation with shares of stock traded on
several stock exchanges. When rumors began to circulate that the
company was experiencing financial difficulties, the price of the
company stock fell drastically. The reporter was a journalist who
wrote a financial news column for a daily newspaper.

One day, while the reporter was discussing the company rumor with
her friend, the friend said, “I wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing
was some kind of stunt to manipulate the price of stock.” The reporter
was aware that the friend knew nothing about the stock market or about
the company. The following day, based solely upon what she had
heard from the friend, the reporter made the following statement in her
column:

Don't be fooled by rumors that the company is in trouble. Insiders say
that  the  whole  thing  is  a  stunt  to  manipulate  the  price  of  the  stock.  I
say the company is still a good investment.

1144

After reading the column, the plaintiff invested in the company's stock
in reliance on the reporter's statement. Two days later, the company
filed a petition in bankruptcy, and its stock became worthless. If the
plaintiff asserts a claim against the reporter for misrepresentation,
which one of the following facts or inferences, if it were the only one
true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the reporter?

(A) At the time the plaintiff purchased the company's stock, the

company's financial condition was a matter of public record.

(B) The reporter's statement “I think the company is a good investment”

was an expression of opinion.

(C) The plaintiff did not purchase the edition of the newspaper that

contained the reporter's statement, but read it after finding it on a
bus.

(D) The reporter did not know that any person would rely on her

statement.

104. Upon borrowing money from her accountant, the landowner executed a
note and a mortgage on her realty in favor of her accountant. The
accountant immediately and properly recorded the mortgage. One
month later, the landowner borrowed money from her brother,
executing a note and a mortgage on the realty in her brother's favor.
The landowner's brother immediately and properly recorded the
mortgage. The landowner died soon afterwards, leaving a will that
devised the realty to her nephew for life, remainder to her niece. Her
nephew subsequently moved onto the realty. Neither the accountant nor
the landowner's brother received payment as required by the notes
executed by the landowner.

Without notifying or serving process on the landowner's nephew and
niece, the accountant asks a court to order a foreclosure sale of the
realty. The court should

(A) order the sale of a life estate only.

(B) order the sale of a remainder only.

(C) order the sale of a fee interest.

(D) deny the accountant's request.

105. The defendant and the victim, who resided in the city, purchased rifles.

Because neither of them had ever fired a rifle before, they decided to

1145

take them to the municipal dump to try them out. Although both
believed that the dump was outside city limits, it was actually within
city limits. At the dump, the defendant shot his rifle in the victim's
direction, aiming slightly to the right to miss the victim. The bullet
struck a rock and ricocheted, hitting the victim in the back and causing
his death.

A city ordinance provides that “Any person who shall discharge a
firearm knowing that he or she is within the municipal limits shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $100.”
Which of the following is the most serious crime of which the
defendant may properly be convicted?

(A) Murder.

(B) Voluntary manslaughter.

(C) Attempted murder.

(D) Discharging a firearm within the municipal limits.

106. The plaintiff asserted a personal injury claim against the defendant for
injuries that she sustained when their cars collided at an intersection.
At the trial, the witness, an eyewitness to the accident, testified that
when it occurred, the traffic light at the intersection was red against the
plaintiff. In a prior deposition given under oath, the witness had stated
that, at the time of the accident, the light was green in the plaintiff's
favor.

The witness was called by the defendant and her testimony was given
on direct examination by the defendant's attorney. On cross-
examination, the witness authenticated the deposition described above,
and the plaintiff's attorney offered it in evidence. Over the defendant's
objection, the deposition should be

(A) admitted for impeachment only.

(B) admitted as substantive evidence only.

(C) admitted for impeachment and as substantive evidence.

(D) excluded.

107. A waiter worked for a catering service owned by a chef. One night

while the waiter was working a dinner party in State A, he dumped hot
soup on a professor. The professor was a citizen of State B and the

1146

chef was a citizen of State A. The professor sued the chef in federal
district court in State A based on diversity jurisdiction. The professor
claimed $100,000 in damages. The professor had the summons served
on the chef personally at her kitchen in State A. The chef wanted to
implead the waiter as a third-party defendant. The waiter lived in State
C, 60 miles away from the district court in State A. The chef had the
summons served on the waiter personally at her home. Under State A's
long-arm statute, state courts did not have personal jurisdiction over
defendants who could not be personally served within the state itself.

Would the federal district court in State A have personal jurisdiction
over the chef's third-party claim?

(A) No, because the district court must follow the long-arm statute of

State A.

(B) No, because there is no indication the waiter would be liable for at

least $75,000 in damages.

(C) Yes, because the waiter lived 60 miles away.

(D) Yes, the chef is diverse from the waiter.

108. Which of the following constitutional provisions is most likely to give
Congress the power to pass a law making it a federal crime for
persons or corporations in the construction industry to practice racial
discrimination in their hiring practices?

(A) The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

(B) The Involuntary Servitude Clause of the Thirteenth Amendment.

(C) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(D) The Previous Condition of Servitude Clause of the Fifteenth

Amendment.

109. On March 1, the seller entered into a written agreement with a licensed
real estate broker. By its terms, the seller agreed to pay the broker a
commission equal to 6 percent of the price if, prior to April 15, the
broker procured a buyer ready, willing, and able to pay $50,000 for
the seller's realty. In return, the broker agreed to make reasonable
efforts to sell it.

After the agreement was executed, the broker advertised the seller's
property and showed it to several prospective buyers. On April 10,

1147

the buyer signed a document agreeing to purchase the seller's realty for
$50,000 but stating that her agreement was contingent upon her success
in obtaining the necessary financing. The same day, the broker
presented to the seller the document that the buyer had signed. The
seller read it, thought for a moment, and handed it back to the broker,
saying, “I won't even consider a deal built around a contingency.”
Although the broker protested that the agreement between him and the
seller did not specify a sale without contingencies, the seller refused
to discuss the matter any further.

On April 11, the broker informed the buyer of the seller's response.
The buyer then obtained a cashier's check for $50,000 payable to the
seller. She delivered the check to the broker, together with a signed
document in which she agreed to purchase the seller's realty for that
sum. On April 14, the broker presented the second document to the
seller with the cashier's check. The seller said, “I've changed my
mind. I'm not interested in selling.”

If the broker asserts a claim against the seller for a commission, the
court should find for

(A) the seller, because he did not agree to sell the realty to the buyer.

(B) the seller, because his rejection of the buyer's offer on April 10

terminated his agreement with the broker.

(C) the broker, because the seller's oral rejection of the buyer's written

offer of April 10 was invalid under the Statute of Frauds.

(D) the broker, because on April 14 the buyer was ready, willing, and

able to purchase the seller's realty for $50,000.

110. The defendant was speeding in her car 15 miles per hour above the
speed limit when the car's steering mechanism failed, causing her to
lose control of the vehicle. The vehicle spun approximately 250
degrees before skidding across the plaintiff's lawn and colliding with
the side of the plaintiff's house, causing serious structural damage to
the building.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damage to his
realty, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant entered his realty without his

permission.

1148

(B) the plaintiff, because the defendant negligently operated her car by

speeding.

(C) the plaintiff, because the defendant had the last clear chance to

avoid damaging his realty.

(D) the defendant, because she was privileged by necessity to enter the

plaintiff's realty.

111. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the plaintiff claimed

that the defendant breached a contract to market the plaintiff's products.
At trial, the plaintiff testified that she and the defendant had reached an
agreement at a conference held in the office of the plaintiff's attorney
on October 15. She stated that she and the defendant discussed five
separate products on that occasion. On direct examination of the
plaintiff, the attorney asked her to name the products that had been
discussed. The plaintiff named four of them, but said she could not
remember the fifth. After having them properly marked for
identification, the attorney offered to show the plaintiff notes that the
attorney had made during the conference, asking whether looking at
them would refresh the plaintiff's recollection. The defendant's
attorney objected to the plaintiff's looking at the notes. The objection
should be

(A) sustained, because the notes had not been made by the plaintiff.

(B) sustained, because the notes were not in evidence.

(C) sustained, because the attorney's question was leading.

(D) overruled.

112. A state law empowers any municipality within the state to collect a

property tax from its landowners if a plan to do so is proposed by its
governing body and approved by a majority of its eligible voters. The
township is a municipality governed by a Township Council. Pursuant
to the above law, the Township Council proposed a property tax plan
and scheduled a special election for August 15 to submit the plan for
voter approval. The Township Council declared that only persons
owning land within the township were eligible to vote in the special
election and that eligible voters were required to register for that
purpose at the Township Hall between the hours of 1 P.M. and 3 P.M. on
Tuesday, July 15. The constitutionality of the special election was
challenged in an appropriate proceeding by a petitioner with standing.

1149

If the special election is found to be unconstitutional, it will probably
be because

(A) the eligibility requirements violated the Fifteenth Amendment by

excluding a discrete class of persons.

(B) the registration requirement had the effect of imposing a residence

qualification for voter eligibility.

(C) all persons who did not own land were excluded from the voting

process.

(D) conducting the special election on an at-large basis could have the
effect of diluting the political power of a particular interest group.

113. The plaintiff was the manufacturer of a chair that she usually sold only
to furniture dealers. When the plaintiff recently stopped making the
product, she found that she had only 75 of the chairs left. As a result,
the plaintiff published the following advertisement in a popular
magazine:

For  Sale  to  the  Public.  Chairs  at  $100  each  (or  $80  each  in  orders  of
10 or more). Act fast. There are only 75 left. When they're gone, don't
ask for any more.

On February 12, the defendant, a furniture dealer, saw the
advertisement and wrote to the plaintiff, “We will purchase all 75
Chairs at the wholesale price.”

On February 15, the plaintiff received the defendant's letter and wrote
to the defendant, saying, “This will confirm our agreement to the sale
of 75 Chairs at $80 each. Shipment to follow immediately.”

On February 20, the defendant telephoned the plaintiff to say that he
had changed his mind and did not want the chairs after all. Within the
next two weeks, the plaintiff sold all the chairs for $80 each to
individuals who purchased one chair each.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from breach of contract, the court should award the plaintiff

(A) a sum equivalent to the profit that the plaintiff would have made by

selling all the chairs to the defendant.

(B) a sum equivalent to the total of the difference between $100 per

1150

chair and the price that the plaintiff actually received.

(C) a sum equivalent to the difference between the price that the

defendant had agreed to pay and the actual market value of the
chairs.

(D) nothing, because the plaintiff sustained no loss as a result of the

defendant's failure to purchase the chairs.

114. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for injuries that he
sustained when a gas stove that he purchased from the defendant
exploded while he was attempting to use it. At trial, the plaintiff
produced a snapshot photograph that he said had been taken by him
prior to the accident and which he said was an accurate representation
of the stove. On behalf of the defendant, the defendant's employee
testified that he had installed the stove. The employee produced a
photograph from an advertising brochure and stated that it fairly and
accurately represented the stove that the plaintiff had purchased from
the defendant and that the employee had installed. The stove in the
photograph offered by the defendant was clearly different from the
stove in the photograph offered by the plaintiff.

Both photographs were offered into evidence, and each party's
attorney objected to admission of the other party's photograph. In
response to the objections, the court should

(A) admit both photographs and allow the jury to decide whether either

of them accurately represents the stove in question.

(B) admit only the photograph offered by the plaintiff.

(C) admit only the photograph offered by the defendant.

(D) not admit either photograph.

115. The landlord, the owner of a seven-story office building, leased the

entire sixth floor to an attorney for a period of five years by a written
lease that fixed the rent at $2,000 per month. There were only two
offices on the sixth floor, identified as Office 6A and Office 6B. A
clause in the lease provided that in the event it ever became necessary
to determine how the rent payments were apportioned, it was
understood that $900 of each month's rent was to be applied to Office
6A, $900 was to be applied to Office 6B, and $200 was to be applied
to the hallways and other common areas. The lease prohibited
assignment by the attorney without the landlord's written permission

1151

and provided that such permission would not be unreasonably
withheld.

One year after executing the lease, the attorney entered into a written
agreement with a second attorney. Under its terms, the second attorney
was to occupy Office 6A for the balance of the attorney's term at a
monthly rental of $1,500 payable to the attorney. The second attorney
was an attorney with a better reputation and a more lucrative practice
than the first attorney's.

The landlord refused to consent to the attorney's arrangement with the
second attorney. The landlord subsequently asserted a claim against
the attorney for breaching the lease provision prohibiting assignment.
Which of the following would be the attorney's most effective
argument in response to that claim?

(A) The attorney's agreement with the second attorney was not an

assignment because the rent paid by the second attorney was not in
the same sum as the rent paid by the first attorney.

(B) The attorney's agreement with the second attorney was not an

assignment because it only gave the second attorney the right to
occupy part of the sixth floor.

(C) The clause prohibiting assignment was an invalid restraint on

alienation.

(D) The landlord's refusal to consent was not reasonable because the
second attorney's credit was as good as the first attorney's.

116. The defendant wrote a column about life in suburbia that appeared

regularly in a newspaper of general circulation. In one of his columns,
the defendant mentioned his neighbor, the plaintiff, by name, and
referred to him as “a silly pig.” If the plaintiff asserts a defamation
claim against the defendant as a result of this reference, which of the
following would be the defendant's most effective argument in
defense?

(A) The defendant did not have actual malice when he made the

statement.

(B) Reasonable persons would not believe that the statement asserted a

fact about the plaintiff.

(C) Reasonable persons would not believe the statement to be true.

1152

(D) At the time the defendant made the statement, he was of the opinion

that it was an accurate assertion of fact.

117. A brick supplier wrote to a builder, stating “We will sell you bricks at

$1 per brick for as many bricks as you would like to purchase, up to
100,000 per quarter.” The brick supplier signed the letter. The builder
did not refrain from entering any other deals or otherwise rely on the
letter, but he did write back, “I accept your offer to sell any bricks I
need to me for $1. We will likely order some bricks this summer.” The
builder signed the letter. Six months later, the builder placed an order
for 50,000 bricks at a $1 per brick. The brick supplier responded that
due to transportation costs outside of its control, the price of bricks
was now $1.50.

The builder sued the supplier for breach of contract. May the builder
recover?

(A) Yes, because the offer was in writing and signed by the supplier.

(B) Yes, because the acceptance was in writing and signed by the

builder.

(C) No, because the revocation was based on increased transportation

costs.

(D) No, because the builder did not provide sufficient consideration.

118. After inheriting a large tract of land, the landowner subdivided it into

60 numbered lots pursuant to state law, filing a plat map and
development scheme that indicated that all lots in the subdivision
would be restricted to residential use. The landowner thereafter
conveyed Lot 1 to his brother and Lot 2 to his sister by deeds
containing a condition restricting the lots to residential use.

The landowner's sister announced her intention to erect a motorcycle
repair shop on Lot 2, and her brother instituted a proceeding seeking to
prevent his sister from doing so. Which of the following additional
facts or inferences, if it was the only one true, would be most likely to
result in a decision in the brother's favor?

(A) The brother's deed to Lot 1 was recorded prior to his sister's

purchase of Lot 2.

(B) The brother purchased Lot 1 before his sister purchased Lot 2.

1153

(C) The brother was aware of the landowner's development scheme

when he purchased Lot 1 from the landowner.

(D) The sister was aware of the landowner's development scheme

when she purchased Lot 2 from the landowner.

119. The plaintiff was hired as a probationary employee by an agency of the
state pursuant to a written contract. The contract provided that at the
end of one year, the parties could agree to renew the contract for an
additional one-year period, but that either party could, without cause,
elect not to renew.

Eleven months after hiring him, the agency informed the plaintiff in
writing that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the year.
The plaintiff asked the agency for a hearing on his fitness to be
rehired, but his request was denied. The plaintiff subsequently
instituted a proceeding to challenge the decision of the agency on the
ground that its failure to hold a hearing before deciding not to rehire
him violated his right to due process.

Which of the following would be the agency's most effective argument
in response to the plaintiff's challenge?

(A) Due process was not required, since the decision not to rehire the

plaintiff did not deprive him of life, liberty, or property.

(B) State employment is a privilege rather than a right, since no person

is guaranteed employment by the state.

(C) There would be no point in holding a hearing in the plaintiff's case,

since the hearing officer would be an employee of the agency and
the findings would necessarily support the decision already made
by the agency.

(D) The plaintiff's constitutional rights could not have been violated by
the decision not to renew his contract, since the contract provided
that the decision could be made without cause.

120. The plaintiff purchased realty in the county in 2000 and has lived on it
since then. The realty is located approximately one mile from a private
airport owned and operated by the defendant. At the time of the
plaintiff's purchase, county ordinances restricted the use of the
defendant's airport to aircraft of a particular type. Noise from the
airport was not disturbing to the plaintiff. Recently, however, the

1154

county adopted an ordinance allowing other kinds of aircraft to use the
airport. Since then, noise levels from the airport have increased,
disturbing the quiet atmosphere of the plaintiff's home.

If the plaintiff desires to assert a claim against the defendant on
account of noise from the airport, which of the following would be his
most effective theory of recovery?

(A) Private nuisance.

(B) Prescriptive aeronautical easement.

(C) Inverse condemnation.

(D) Continuing trespass.

121. While the defendant and his wife were standing in line outside a movie
theater, the defendant whispered to his wife that he had committed a
series of robberies the previous week. The defendant was
subsequently arrested and charged with the robberies in a jurisdiction
that holds that confidential marital communications are privileged.

A prosecution witness attempted to testify that he overheard the
defendant's whispered statement to his wife while standing behind
them in the movie line. If the defendant objects to this testimony, his
objection should be

(A) sustained, because communications made within a marriage are

presumed to be confidential.

(B) sustained, because the statement is inadmissible hearsay.

(C) overruled, because the statement is admissible as an admission.

(D) overruled, because a communication concerning a crime is not

subject to the marital privilege.

122. After he was fired, a man filed suit in state court in State A against a

company. The man's complaint alleged a single federal discrimination
claim and a number of state law claims. The company removed the
case to federal district court. The man then amended his complaint to
remove the discrimination claim because he believed it was untenable
and moved to have the case remanded to state court.

May the federal district court remand the case to state court?

(A) No, because the case must be dismissed.

1155

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

(B) No, because the state claims were in federal court based on

pendent jurisdiction.

(C) Yes, because the claim was originally brought in state court.

(D) Yes, because of judicial economy.

123. The defendant was charged with assaulting the victim. At the trial, the

victim testified that he accidentally bumped into the defendant while
walking on a crowded street, and that the defendant responded by
repeatedly hitting and punching him. As part of his defense, the
defendant denied that he had ever struck any person intentionally and
testified that any contact between the victim and him had been
accidental.

The prosecutor subsequently called a witness. The witness testified
that she and the defendant were divorced, but that she had been
married to him for 10 years. She stated that during the period of their
marriage, the defendant had frequently struck her with his fists in
public places. The jurisdiction recognized a privilege for marital
communications. If the defendant's attorney objects and asks the court
to exclude the witness's testimony, the testimony should be

(A) excluded, because the jurisdiction recognizes a privilege for

marital communications.

(B) excluded, because it is not relevant to a material issue.

(C) admitted, because it bears on the defendant's reputation for truth

and veracity.

(D) admitted, because the defendant testified in his own defense.

124. The plaintiff showed his silver coins to the defendant and asked

whether the defendant would be interested in trading them for
chickens. After inspecting the coins, the defendant and the plaintiff
placed them in a bag that they sealed together and left with a banker
whom they both knew. Then, in a writing signed by both of them, they
agreed to the trade.

Pursuant to the terms of their agreement, the defendant was to deliver
6,000 fryer chickens to the plaintiff on July 1, at which time the bag of
coins would be turned over to the defendant as payment in full. In May,
weather conditions were such that the price of fryer chickens
increased to three times what it had been when the agreement was

1156

signed. Although it was foreseeable that the market price for fryer
chickens would change dramatically, neither party knew that the
marker price of fryer chickens would change,

On July 1, the defendant refused to deliver 6,000 fryer chickens to the
plaintiff. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for breach
of contract, the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because neither party knew that the market price of

fryer chickens would change.

(B) the defendant, because the likelihood of fluctuation in the value of

money makes this contract aleatory.

(C) the plaintiff, because it was foreseeable that the market price of

fryer chickens would change dramatically.

(D) the plaintiff, because the transaction was not a sale as defined by

the UCC.

125. The defendant, a water supply company, owned a well adjacent to the
plaintiff's land. By a conveyance that properly described the size and
location of the easement, the plaintiff granted the defendant an
easement across his realty “for the installation of underground pipe or
pipes for the transport of water to customers of the defendant.”
Pursuant to the easement, the defendant subsequently installed a single
underground pipe across the plaintiff's land. After the installation, the
defendant regularly entered the plaintiff's land to service its
underground pipe, occasionally excavating for that purpose. Twenty
years after the easement had been granted, construction of a nearby
housing development caused the number of the defendant's customers
to double, making it necessary for the defendant to transport more
water than the single pipe could carry. The defendant notified the
plaintiff that it planned to install a second underground pipe alongside
the first within the area over which the defendant had an easement. The
plaintiff objected and instituted an appropriate proceeding to stop the
defendant from installing a second underground pipe.

Which of the following arguments would be most likely to result in a
judgment for the plaintiff?

(A) Twenty years of continuous use by the defendant established the

scope of the easement.

1157

(B) The initial installation of a single pipe by the defendant established

the scope of the easement.

(C) When the easement was granted, neither party could have

anticipated that the number of the defendant's customers would
double.

(D) The plaintiff's grant to the defendant did not specify the number of

pipes that could be installed.

126. By a contract calling for the delivery of marketable title, the seller

agreed to sell the buyer a parcel of realty consisting of four adjacent
lots. On the date set for closing, the seller informed the buyer that one
of the four lots was encumbered by a utility company easement. The
seller said that it was unlikely that the utility company would ever
attempt to exercise its easement and offered to either execute a general
warranty deed to the entire parcel, including a covenant against
encumbrances, or to convey the remaining three lots to the buyer,
deducting from the purchase price the reasonable value of the
encumbered lot. The buyer refused both offers.

In litigation between the seller and the buyer for breach of contract, a
court should find for

(A) the seller, because a covenant against encumbrances would have

given the buyer sufficient protection.

(B) the seller, because title to the remaining three lots was marketable
and abatement of the purchase price would assure the buyer of
receiving the value for which he had bargained.

(C) the buyer, because the seller knew of the easement at the time the

contract of sale was formed.

(D) the buyer, because the seller failed to deliver marketable title.

127. At the trial of a personal injury action brought by the plaintiff against
the defendant and arising out of an automobile accident, the plaintiff
attempted to testify that immediately following the accident, the
defendant offered to pay $500 to fix the plaintiff's car. Over objection
by the defendant's attorney, the plaintiff's statement should be

(A) excluded, because to admit such evidence would violate public

policy.

(B) admitted, because the court could give the defendant an opportunity

1158

to explain his offer.

(C) admitted, as a declaration against the defendant's pecuniary interest.

(D) admitted, as an implied admission of a party.

128. The defendant was out walking when she saw the plaintiff, a seven-

year-old child, suddenly chase a ball into the street in the path of a car
driven by a driver. Afraid that the plaintiff would be hit by the car, the
defendant ran into the roadway and pushed the plaintiff out of the way.
The driver's car struck the defendant. The plaintiff was not hit by the
driver's car, but he hurt his knees when he fell to the ground as a result
of being pushed by the defendant. The jurisdiction applies the all-or-
nothing rule of contributory negligence.

If the plaintiff asserts a negligence claim against the defendant for the
injuries to his knees, which one of the following additional facts or
inferences, if it was the only one true, would be most likely to result in
a judgment for the defendant?

(A) The plaintiff's injury was proximately caused by the negligence of

the driver.

(B) If the defendant had not pushed him out of the way, the plaintiff

would have been struck by the driver's car and killed.

(C) The defendant was severely injured as a result of being struck by

the driver's car.

(D) The situation confronted the defendant with an emergency.

129. At a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of aggravated assault. On
appeal, the defendant's conviction was reversed on the ground that, as
a matter of law, the evidence against her was insufficient to establish
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Subsequently, the prosecutor
attempted to try the defendant again on the same charge. If the
defendant asserts that the subsequent prosecution violates the
constitutional protection against double jeopardy and moves to dismiss
it, her motion should be

(A) denied, because the reversal of her conviction ended any jeopardy

that attached as a result of the initial prosecution.

(B) denied, because the reversal amounted to a declaration that the trial
was a nullity and that she had, therefore, never been in jeopardy as
a result of the initial prosecution.

1159

(C) denied, because the defendant waived the constitutional protection

against double jeopardy by appealing her conviction.

(D) granted.

130. After he was injured during surgery, a man sued a doctor in federal
district court. The doctor's lawyer hired a private investigator, who
interviewed several witnesses to the surgery, including the head nurse.
The investigator filmed all of the interviews with his phone and made
transcripts of them. During the head nurse's interview, she stated
certain facts regarding what happened during the surgery that were
only known to the head nurse. Shortly after the interview, the head
nurse died. Is the man entitled to a copy or transcript of the interview?

(A) Yes, because the head nurse is dead.

(B) Yes, because the investigator was the one who filmed and

transcribed the interviews.

(C) No, because the interview was prepared in anticipation of

litigation.

(D) No, because the interview was prepared by another on the

attorney's behalf.

131. The state published an advertisement calling for bids “for a contract to
be the exclusive supplier of fuel for state vehicles.” The plaintiff
submitted a bid and, after negotiation, entered into a written contract to
supply at a specified price per gallon for a period of one year “all fuel
ordered by the state.” Several months after executing the contract, the
plaintiff learned that the state was purchasing substantial amounts of
fuel from other suppliers.

The plaintiff asserted a claim against the state for breach of contract.
At the trial, state attorneys offered the written contract into evidence
and pointed out that its language did not specifically state that the
plaintiff was to be the exclusive supplier. When the plaintiff attempted
to offer a copy of the advertisement calling for bids into evidence,
state attorneys objected on the ground that the advertisement was
inadmissible under the parol evidence rule. The plaintiff's most
effective argument in response to the state's objections would be that
the advertisement

(A) tends to show that the written contract was ambiguous.

1160

(B) was in writing.

(C) was a communication that led to a written contract.

(D) was an invitation to negotiate.

132. In 2008, the landowner conveyed a parcel of realty to her oldest son in
fee simple absolute as a gift. At the landowner's request, the oldest son
did not record the conveyance. In 2010, the landowner borrowed
$10,000 from a neighbor, executing a note purporting to be secured by
a mortgage on the land. The neighbor did not record the mortgage. In
2012, the landowner purported to convey the land in fee simple to her
youngest son as a gift. The youngest son immediately recorded the
deed. On default by the landowner, the neighbor now seeks to
foreclose on the land.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides that “No transfer of an interest in
real property shall be good and effectual in law or equity against
creditors or subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless
it shall be recorded.”

Is the neighbor entitled to foreclose on the land?

(A) No, because his mortgage was not recorded.

(B) No, because the youngest son recorded his deed in 2012.

(C) Yes.

(D) No, because the oldest son owns the land in fee simple absolute.

133. The plaintiff bought from the defendant, a car dealer, a new car

manufactured by the manufacturer. The vehicle was equipped with a
seat belt warning indicator, although the law did not require such a
device. The indicator was designed to cause a bright red light on the
dashboard to begin glowing when the engine was started and to remain
lit until the driver's seat belt was fastened. When the car was delivered
to the plaintiff, an employee of the defendant explained to the plaintiff
that the seat belt warning indicator was not working, but that the
defendant would repair it without charge as soon as the necessary
parts were received.

The following day, the plaintiff was involved in an accident while
driving the new car. As a result of the impact, she was thrown from the
vehicle and sustained an injury when her head struck the pavement. If

1161

she had been wearing a seat belt at the time, she would not have been
injured.

The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim against the defendant for
her injuries on the ground that the failure of the seat belt warning
indicator made the vehicle defective. Which of the following would be
the defendant's most effective argument in response to that allegation?

(A) When the plaintiff drove the vehicle, she was aware that the seat

belt warning indicator was not working.

(B) The law did not require the vehicle to be equipped with a seat belt

warning indicator.

(C) It is impossible to prove with certainty that the plaintiff would have

worn a seat belt if the seat belt warning indicator had been
working.

(D) The failure of the seat belt warning indicator was the result of the

negligence of the manufacturer.

134. A man owned a home worth $200,000. He had three mortgages on the
property. The first mortgage was for $150,000 and was owed to first
bank. The second mortgage was for $30,000 and was owed to second
bank. The third mortgage was for $10,000 and was owed to third bank.
The first mortgage was foreclosed, and the bid at the foreclosure sale
was $200,000. The attorney's fees and foreclosure expenses were
$15,000, and the accrued interest on the first mortgage was $5,000.

How will the funds from the foreclosure sale be distributed?

(A) $5,000 to the accrued interest, $15,000 to attorneys and foreclosure
expenses, $150,000 to the first mortgage, $30,000 to the second
mortgage, and nothing to the third mortgage.

(B) $5,000 to the accrued interest, $15,000 to attorneys and foreclosure
expenses, $150,000 to the first mortgage, $20,000 to the second
mortgage, and $10,000 to the third.

(C) $5,000 to the accrued interest, $15,000 to attorneys and foreclosure
expenses, $140,000 to the first mortgage, $30,000 to the second
mortgage, and $10,000 to the third mortgage

(D) $15,000 to attorneys and foreclosure expenses, $150,000 to first
mortgage, $30,000 to second mortgage, $5,000 to third mortgage,

1162

nothing to the accrued interest.

135. After the plaintiff instituted litigation against the defendant, the

defendant's attorney demanded that the plaintiff furnish the answers to
a list of interrogatories as provided by the state code of civil
procedure. Interrogatory #4 was “List the plaintiff's gross sales
receipts for each month during the four-year period in controversy.” In
response to this interrogatory, the plaintiff responded, “Gross receipts
for the period in question are contained in an industry publication.”
The court provided judicial notice that the industry publication was a
reputable source that reasonably well informed people regarded as
accurate.

At trial, the defendant's attorney attempted to offer into evidence those
portions of the industry publication listing the plaintiff's gross receipts
for the months in question. Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney,
the court should rule those portions of the industry publication

(A) inadmissible, because the contents of the industry publication have

not been shown to be accurate.

(B) inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.

(C) admissible as an admission of a party.

(D) admissible, because the industry publication was shown to be a
reputable source that reasonably well informed people regard as
accurate.

136. After the victim lost all his money to the defendant in a dice game, the
two men began to argue. During the course of the argument, the
defendant stabbed the victim in the leg with a knife. The victim
staggered home and pounded on the door, begging his wife to let him
in. The wife realized that the victim needed medical attention because
he was bleeding badly, but she was so angry at him for gambling that
she refused to open the door or call a doctor. The victim collapsed on
the doorstep and died an hour later from loss of blood. The wife could
have secured immediate medical attention for the victim, and if she had
done so, the victim would not have died.

If the defendant is prosecuted for the murder of the victim, which of
the following would be his most effective argument in defense?

(A) The defendant did not cause the victim's death because the victim

1163

would not have died if the wife had secured prompt medical
attention.

(B) Leg wounds do not usually result in death.

(C) It was unforeseeable that the wife would refuse to secure medical
attention for the victim when she knew that he needed it so badly.

(D) The wife's omission to secure medical attention was a substantial

factor in producing the victim's death.

137. A state statute grants state employees an annual 5 percent salary

increase. Another statute provides that upon retirement, a state
employee shall receive an annual pension equivalent to 60 percent of
the salary received during the year immediately prior to retirement.
The state also maintains a group health insurance plan for state
employees. After determining that the health insurance plan could be
operated less expensively if it did not include persons over the age of
65, the state legislature passed a compulsory retirement law requiring
state employees to retire at the age of 65.

The plaintiff, who was employed by the state as a station engineer,
reached the age of 65 several years after the compulsory retirement
law was passed. His job did not require any skills or abilities related
to age. When he was informed that he was required to retire, the
plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory retirement
law. In support of his challenge, the plaintiff proved that a federal law
permits station engineers employed by the federal government to
continue working until they are 70.

In deciding the plaintiff's claim, the court should hold that the state's
mandatory retirement law is

(A) invalid under the Supremacy Clause.

(B) invalid, because the plaintiff's job did not require skills or abilities

that were related to age.

(C) valid, because the state could operate its employee health insurance

plan on a more economically efficient basis by mandating
retirement at 65.

(D) valid, because the federal government may not impose economic

burdens on the state.

1164

138. A banker, a citizen of State A, was injured in a car accident with a
doctor, a citizen of State A, and a lawyer, a citizen of State B. The
banker sued both the doctor and the lawyer in state court for $100,000.
The banker then voluntarily dismissed the doctor. Twenty-five days
later, the lawyer sought removal to the federal district court.

May the lawsuit be removed to federal court?

(A) Yes, because there is now complete diversity of citizenship.

(B) Yes, because the lawyer sought removal within 30 days of the

doctor's dismissal.

(C) No, because the lawyer did not seek removal within 14 days of the

doctor's dismissal.

(D) No, because the banker voluntarily dismissed the doctor.

139. The Department of Highway Transportation is the agency of state

government responsible for maintaining state highways. While driving
on a state highway, the defendant attempted to pass the plaintiff's
vehicle on the right. As she did so, one of the defendant's wheels
struck a pothole, causing her car to go out of control and strike the
plaintiff's car. The pothole existed because the Department of Highway
Transportation was negligent in maintaining the road surface, and there
were many potholes in the area. The defendant would not have lost
control of her car if she had not hit the pothole while driving at an
unreasonably fast rate of speed. A statute in the jurisdiction prohibits
passing on the right. The jurisdiction has also abolished the concept of
governmental immunity.

The plaintiff subsequently asserted a negligence claim against the
defendant for injuries sustained in the accident. If the defendant's only
argument in defense is that the pothole was a superseding cause of
harm, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant's attempt to pass the plaintiff on

the right was a violation of an automobile safety statute.

(B) the plaintiff, because potholes are often found on the road surfaces

where the accident occurred.

(C) the plaintiff, because the concept of governmental immunity has

been abolished in the jurisdiction.

1165

(D) the defendant, because the accident would not have happened but

for the existence of the pothole.

140. The plaintiff had an exclusive five-year contract to sell products
manufactured by the defendant. When the defendant canceled the
contract in its third year, the plaintiff entered into a similar contract
with another manufacturer. The plaintiff then asked an attorney to sue
the defendant for breach of contract. Because the compensation plans
in the plaintiff's contracts with the defendant and the other company
were extremely complex, the attorney was unable to determine whether
the defendant's breach had damaged the plaintiff. Before agreeing to
represent the plaintiff, the attorney therefore arranged for the plaintiff
to meet with the witness, an accountant. At the attorney's request, the
witness interviewed the plaintiff, obtained certain facts from her, and
made mathematical calculations that she submitted to the attorney.

The attorney subsequently commenced a lawsuit against the defendant
on the plaintiff's behalf. At the trial, the defendant's attorney called the
accountant as a witness and attempted to question her about her
interview with the plaintiff. If the attorney objects to the examination
of the witness, the most effective argument in support of her objection
would be that statements made by the plaintiff to the witness are

(A) privileged as part of an attorney's work product.

(B) records kept in the course of business.

(C) inadmissible hearsay.

(D) confidential communications between client and attorney.

141. A man and a woman were residents of a local housing project in the

center of the city. Because the housing project was thought of as a
hotbed of crime and gang activity, the city wanted to tear down the
project and relocate the project's 800 residents to several smaller
apartment buildings spread out among the far suburbs. The man and the
woman filed suit against the city housing authority in federal district
court, claiming that the city's plan violated their federal due process
rights. The man and the woman wanted to certify a class made up of
the current project residents. The best law firm in the city agreed to
take the case, and the man and the woman were longtime residents of
the project who each owned small successful businesses. Their action
sought an injunction to stop the planned demolition and relocation from
going forward.

1166

Can the action go forward as a class action?

(A) Yes, because the injunction would likely be worth more than

$75,000.

(B) Yes, because the requested injunction is appropriate to the class as

a whole.

(C) No, because a class action cannot be based on a request for an

injunction.

(D) No, because joinder of the project residents would be more

appropriate.

142. A man was negligently flying his new drone when it hit a woman
walking on the sidewalk nearby. According to Federal Aviation
Authority law, drones were aircraft that needed to be registered. The
man's drone was not. The drone did not hit the woman very hard, but it
did cause her to fall on the ground. Although an ordinary person would
have suffered at most slight scrapes or bruises, the woman had a rare
brain condition that made any fall extremely dangerous to her optic
nerves. Because of the fall, the woman's optic nerves disconnected and
she became blind. The woman sued the man for damages related to
loss of her sight.

May the woman recover?

(A) Yes, because the man failed to register his drone.

(B) Yes, because the man negligently hit her with the drone.

(C) No, because the blindness was caused by the woman's rare medical

condition.

(D) No, because an ordinary person would only have suffered slight

scrapes or bruises.

143. At the jury trial of an action by a bank against the defendant on a

promissory note, the defendant testified that the signature on the note
was not his. An employee of the bank testified that she recognized the
signature as the defendant's. The judge believed the signature on the
promissory note was the defendant's. Accordingly, the judge decided
that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the signature
on the note was the defendant's. The jury was also given an
authenticated sample of the defendant's signature so that they could

1167

decide whether the signature on the promissory note was the
defendant's.

If the bank's attorney offers the promissory note into evidence, it
should be

(A) admitted, because any dispute regarding the genuineness of a

signature should be decided by the jury.

(B) admitted, because the judge decided that the evidence was

sufficient to support a finding that the signature on the note was the
defendant's.

(C) admitted, because the jury was given an authenticated sample of the

defendant's signature so that they could decide whether the
signature on the promissory note was the defendant's.

(D) admitted, because the judge believed that the signature on the

promissory note was the defendant's.

144. A plaintiff belongs to an ethnic minority that constitutes 10 percent of
the general population of the city. Approximately 10 percent of the
motorists driving on a particular road are members of the plaintiff's
ethnic minority. One day, while the plaintiff was driving her
automobile on the road, a police officer stopped her and issued a
traffic summons charging her with driving in excess of the statutory
speed limit. In her defense, the plaintiff asserted that the traffic statute
was unconstitutional as applied.

Which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were
the only one true, would best support the plaintiff's assertion?

(A) In the past two years, the plaintiff has received three such

summonses from the officer, but she has never received one from
another officer.

(B) In the past two years, the officer has issued a total of 300

summonses for driving in excess of the statutory speed limit on the
road, all of which were issued to members of the plaintiff's ethnic
group.

(C) Properly compiled statistics indicate that members of the plaintiff's
ethnic group do not customarily drive faster than members of any
other ethnic group.

1168

(D) At the time the officer issued the summons to the plaintiff, many

people who did not belong to the plaintiff's ethnic group were
driving on the road at speeds in excess of the plaintiff's speed, and
the officer did not issue summonses to any of them.

145. A defendant knew that he often became intoxicated upon drinking small

quantities of alcoholic beverages. He frequently visited the
neighborhood tavern because he liked the atmosphere, but he usually
ordered orange juice or some other non-alcoholic beverage. While at
the tavern one night, the defendant drank half of a friend's glass of beer.
Soon afterwards, he began shouting and throwing objects about the
tavern. A chair that he hurled across the room struck the bartender,
injuring her severely. As a result, the defendant was subsequently
arrested and prosecuted. At the defendant's trial, the defense attorney
called a psychiatrist to the witness stand to testify that the defendant
suffered from a mental illness that made him extremely susceptible to
the effects of alcohol. The psychiatrist offered to testify further that
even a small quantity of beer was likely to make the defendant become
physically violent, and that when this happened to him, he was not
aware that his conduct would result in injury to others.

The defendant's prosecution was for criminal battery. If the prosecutor
moves to exclude the psychiatrist's testimony, the motion should be

(A) granted, because the defendant knew that he often became

intoxicated upon drinking small quantities of alcoholic beverages.

(B) granted, because the sanity of a defendant is a question of fact to be

determined by a jury.

(C) denied, because a jury might find that the defendant's intoxication
prevented him from forming the intent to injure the bartender.

(D) denied, because that testimony could establish that the defendant's

intoxication was involuntary.

146. The buyer and the seller signed a written document agreeing to the sale

of the seller's realty to the buyer. The document adequately described
the realty, required the seller to deliver marketable title by a general
warranty deed, and set the date for closing. It also stated that the price
would be determined by agreement of the parties prior to the date of
closing. The value of real estate in the area could be objectively
determined rather easily. Three weeks before the date set for closing,
the buyer telephoned the seller to discuss the price of the realty. At that

1169

time, the seller told the buyer that she had changed her mind and would
not sell the realty to the buyer at any price. If the buyer asserts a claim
against the seller for breach of contract, the court should find for

(A) the seller, because the Statute of Frauds requires a contract for the

sale of realty to be in writing and to state the price.

(B) the seller, because the parties did not agree on a method for

determining the price.

(C) the buyer, because the value of real estate in the area can be

objectively determined.

(D) the buyer, because where a written contract omits the price term,

the price is to be a reasonable price.

147. The defendant was a college student preparing to take an important

exam. Before the exam, she sneaked into the professor's office, hoping
to steal a copy of the exam answer. The exam answer was locked
securely in the dean's safe, however, and the defendant was therefore
unable to find it. While she was looking, the professor discovered her
in his office, and the defendant told him her reason for being there. A
state statute prohibits the theft of certain specifically defined
“information,” which specifically included “exam answers.” The
defendant did not believe an exam answer was “information” under the
statute. If the defendant is charged with attempting to violate the
statute, she should be found

(A) not guilty, because the exam answers were, in fact, securely locked
in the dean's safe and the defendant could not possibly have stolen
them.

(B) not guilty, because an exam answer is “information” as defined by

the statute, but the defendant believed that it was not.

(C) guilty, because the theft of an exam answer by one preparing to take

the exam is “inherently immoral.”

(D) guilty, because an exam answer is “information” as defined by the

statute, even though the defendant believed that it was not.

148. A group of friends were playing a pickup soccer game. The plaintiff
was dribbling the ball down the field when the defendant kicked the
ball away, tripping the plaintiff and injuring him. If the plaintiff sues
the defendant for battery, the defendant's best defense is

1170

(A) by playing in the game, the plaintiff assumed the risk of the contact.

(B) by playing in the game, the plaintiff consented to the contact.

(C) the defendant did not intend to injure the plaintiff

(D) being tripped in a soccer game is not offensive to a reasonable

sense of dignity.

149. A will devised a parcel of real estate to a brother and his sister as
joint tenants with full right of survivorship. The brother died after
quitclaiming his interest in the realty to his wife. Subsequently, the
sister died, leaving a will that purported to devise her interest in the
realty to her daughter. Which of the following statements most
accurately describes the rights of the wife and the daughter after the
deaths of the brother and the sister?

(A) The wife is the sole owner of the realty.

(B) The daughter is the sole owner of the realty.

(C) The wife and the daughter hold the realty as joint tenants.

(D) The wife and the daughter hold the realty as tenants in common.

150. Congress authorizes a federal agency to lease federally owned land to

livestock ranchers for grazing purposes at specified rental rates. The
plaintiff also owns land in the area that it leases for grazing purposes.
The plaintiff complains that the rates charged by the federal agency are
significantly lower than those charged by the plaintiff and that this has
resulted in unfair competition that will cause the plaintiff an immediate
loss of revenue. In an appropriate proceeding, the plaintiff challenges
the constitutionality of the federal lease.

Which of the following arguments would be most effective IN
OPPOSITION TO the plaintiff's claim?

(A) The Property Clause of Article IV of the Constitution empowers

Congress to dispose of federal land as it sees fit.

(B) The lease of federal land is valid under the Commerce Clause.

(C) The plaintiff lacks standing because the activities of the federal

agency do not affect it directly.

(D) The federal government is immune from claims based on

allegations of unfair competition.

1171

151. A breeder agreed to sell a farmer a cow, which both parties believed
to be barren. The contract price was $200. Prior to delivery of the
cow, the breeder realized the cow was pregnant and refused to deliver
her because her value as a breeding cow was at least $1,000. May the
breeder rescind the contract?

(A) Yes, because the characteristic on which the parties were mistaken

was a basic assumption of the contract.

(B) Yes, because the cow is worth much more as a breeding cow.

(C) No, because the mistake merely went to the adequacy of price.

(D) No, because the farmer merely received an unexpected benefit in

the deal.

152. At the trial of a robbery prosecution, a witness for the prosecution

testified that the robber walked with a limp. While the witness was on
the stand, the prosecutor asked the defendant to walk across the
courtroom. If the defendant objects, asserting his Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination, his objection should be

(A) sustained, because the defendant has not waived the privilege by

testifying in his own behalf.

(B) sustained, because the jury is likely to interpret a refusal by the

defendant to walk across the courtroom as evidence that he is
guilty.

(C) overruled, because the Fifth Amendment privilege applies only to

testimony.

(D) overruled, because the defendant has waived the privilege by

personally appearing in the courtroom.

153. Following her indictment by a grand jury for bank robbery, the
defendant voluntarily surrendered at police headquarters.

The officers went to lunch and returned to headquarters an hour later.
Upon their return, they ordered the defendant to appear in a lineup for
identification purposes in connection with the bank robbery. At first,
the defendant refused. When the officer threatened to use force to
compel her appearance, however, the defendant appeared without
resisting. Witnesses at the lineup identified her as the bank robber.

If the defendant objects to the admission of evidence of the lineup

1172

identification, which of the following would be her most effective
argument in support of her objection?

(A) The defendant was deprived of her right to have an attorney present

during the lineup.

(B) The lineup deprived the defendant of the right to confront her

accusers.

(C) The lineup violated her right against self-incrimination.

(D) Police officers coerced the defendant into appearing in the lineup.

154. A man was snowmobiling with his friend as a passenger. The man
negligently cut across a road and an oncoming car struck the
snowmobile. The friend was severely injured. The driver of the car
called an ambulance, and the ambulance picked up the friend. Because
of the serious nature of the friend's injuries, the ambulance drove in
excess of the speed limit and crashed into a pole. The friend was
killed in the crash. The friend's estate sued the man.

Assuming the estate may recover for the injuries sustained during the
initial car crash, can it recover for the friend's death?

(A) No, because the ambulance broke the chain of liability.

(B) No, because the ambulance was negligent by speeding.

(C) Yes, because the ambulance's rescue attempt was foreseeable.

(D) Yes, because the death was preceded by the friend's serious

injuries.

155. By a properly executed and recorded deed, the landowner conveyed a

parcel of real estate with a building on it as follows:

to the church for as long as the land is used by the church for church
purposes;  and  when  the  land  ceases  to  be  so  used,  to  the  hospital  for
as long as the land shall be used by the hospital for hospital purposes;
and  when  the  land  ceases  to  be  so  used,  to  my  son  if  my  son  is  then
living.

The church moved onto the real estate, using the building as a house of
worship.

If the validity of the interest held by the son is challenged on the sole
ground that it violates the Rule Against Perpetuities, the interest of the

1173

son should be declared

(A) valid, because the church and the hospital are charitable

institutions.

(B) valid.

(C) void, because there is no assurance that the interest of the son will

vest during the period established by the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(D) void, because the interest of the hospital is void.

156. After a nuclear power plant was built in the state, the state passed the
Nuclear Waste Act. The Act regulates the storage of radioactive
wastes and authorizes the construction of radioactive waste storage
facilities at specified locations within the state. Section 40 of the Act
provides that “No radioactive waste storage facility in the state shall
store or accept for storage any radioactive waste resulting from
activities conducted more than five miles from said storage facility.”
All storage facilities within the state that are authorized by the Nuclear
Waste Act are located more than five miles from the state line.

If the constitutionality of Section 40 is challenged in an appropriate
proceeding, it is LEAST likely to be declared unconstitutional under
the

(A) Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

(B) Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(C) Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(D) Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

157. A married couple lived in State A. The wife moved to State B and

filed for divorce in State B state court. The husband was visiting State
B on business and to see his daughters when he was served with the
divorce papers. In a special appearance, the husband moved to quash
service, arguing he had insufficient contacts with State B to confer
personal jurisdiction.

Does the State B court have personal jurisdiction over the husband?

(A) Yes, because the divorce action was filed in state court in State B.

(B) Yes, because the husband was personally served in State B.

(C) No, because the husband was only in State B on business and to see

1174

his daughters.

(D) No, because there is no indication the husband consented to

jurisdiction.

158. The security guard of a warehouse was making his rounds after closing

time one night when he found the defendant walking around inside the
warehouse. When the guard asked him what he was doing there, the
defendant replied that he had been driving past the warehouse when he
noticed that its door was open, and that he had entered to report this to
the guard. The guard called the police, and the defendant was arrested
and charged with violating a statute providing that “any person
entering the building of another for the purpose of committing a crime
therein is guilty of burglary.”

At the defendant's trial, the prosecutor tried to prove that the
defendant's van, parked outside the warehouse at the time of the
defendant's arrest, had license plates on it that had been stolen from an
out-of-state vehicle the day before the defendant's arrest.

Over objection by the defendant's attorney, evidence that the license
plates had been stolen should be

(A) inadmissible, because the defendant was not on trial for stealing

license plates.

(B) inadmissible, because the defendant was not convicted of stealing

license plates.

(C) admissible, because it tends to establish that the defendant was

likely to engage in criminal behavior.

(D) admissible, because it tends to establish that the defendant made

special preparations for the commission of a crime.

159. The farmer was the owner of a peach orchard. On May 15, the seller
contracted in writing to sell the land to the buyer for $200,000 under
terms specified. The agreement called for the delivery of marketable
title and set July 15 as the date for closing. The seller did not own the
land on May 15 but planned to acquire title to it prior to the closing.
On June 1, the buyer assigned his rights under the contract to an
attorney. On June 15, the seller acquired title to the land by purchasing
it from the farmer for $150,000. On July 15, the seller tendered a
general warranty deed, but the buyer and the attorney both refused to

1175

go through with the transaction.

If the seller asserts a breach of contract claim for damages against the
buyer, the court should find for

(A) the seller, because at the time of closing, the seller held marketable

title to the realty.

(B) the seller, under the doctrine of estoppel by deed.

(C) the buyer, because at the time of contracting, the seller did not hold

title to the land.

(D) the buyer, because at the time of closing, the seller's interest was

outside the chain of title.

160. A businessman, a citizen of State A, sued a real estate company in

federal district court in State A for breach of contract. The real estate
company was incorporated in State B and was run by a group of
executives based in State A. However, the majority of its apartments
were located in State C. The businessman claimed that after he was
injured in one of the company's luxury apartments, the company gave
him a free apartment for life in exchange for his promise not to file
suit. However, three years after giving him the free apartment, the
company started charging him rent. The company defended its decision
to start charging the businessman rent by pointing to a new law enacted
by Congress that made gifts of free apartments illegal because of
concerns free apartments were being used to bribe foreign
businessmen and other officials. After a trial, the district court ruled in
favor of the businessman. The company appealed, arguing the case
should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

How should the court rule?

(A) The case should be dismissed, because the company was a citizen

of State A.

(B) The case should be dismissed, because the majority of the

company's apartments were in State C.

(C) The case should not be dismissed, because the company did not

challenge jurisdiction in the initial trial.

(D) The case should not be dismissed, because the company's defense

is based on a law passed by Congress.

1176

161. After police officers arrested the defendant for driving with a

suspended license, the officers handcuffed the defendant and placed
him in their patrol car. The police officers then searched the
defendant's car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the
backseat. At trial, the defendant argued that the search of his car was
unlawful. If the court rules in the defendant's favor, it will be because

(A) searches conducted without prior approval by a judge or magistrate

are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

(B) the defendant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons

or evidence at the time of the search.

(C) the search of the car was not the result of a valid inventory search.

(D) the interior of a car is always within the immediate control of an

arrestee.

162. An insurance salesman sued a company in federal district court after

he was passed over for a promotion. The salesman's claim arose under
federal employment law. In the salesman's complaint, he gave a short
statement claiming he was entitled to relief, but the complaint did not
contain details regarding the alleged employment discrimination and it
set out three different claims that were inconsistent with each other. In
response, the company filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a
claim.

How should the court rule?

(A) Deny the motion, because the complaint contained a short and plain

statement of the claim.

(B) Deny the motion, because the complaint gave the company notice of

the lawsuit.

(C) Grant the motion, because the complaint did not adequately allege a

prima facie case.

(D) Grant the motion, because the complaint contained inconsistent

claims.

163. A man told his friend, a druggist, that he was planning to kill his wife

and asked the druggist to help him by furnishing a poison. Although the
druggist did not actually intend to help the man kill his wife, he said
that he would because he did not want his friend to be angry at him.
The druggist gave the man a commonly used antibiotic, telling him that

1177

it was a deadly and undetectable poison. The druggist knew that the
antibiotic was not supposed to be dispensed without a prescription and
that about 2 percent of the people who received it developed an
allergic reaction to it, but he did not believe that it would hurt the wife.
That night while the wife was asleep, the man injected her with the
antibiotic that the druggist had given him. Because she was allergic to
the drug, the wife became seriously ill and nearly died.

If the druggist is prosecuted for attempted murder, he should be found

(A) guilty, because giving the man the antibiotic without a prescription
with knowledge that the man would give it to his wife shows a
reckless disregard for human life.

(B) guilty, because he did not attempt to stop the man from killing his

wife.

(C) guilty, because he furnished the drug knowing that the man would

use it to attempt to kill his wife.

(D) not guilty, because he did not believe that the wife would die.

164. The defendant was arrested and charged in a state court with the

unlawful possession of a dangerous drug. As his defense, the defendant
asserted that he was an undercover officer in a special division of the
state police department and that he had possessed the drug lawfully as
part of an undercover assignment. During the presentation of its case,
the prosecution called the witness, an official of the state police
department. The witness testified that he was the custodian of a
personnel file that contained the names of all undercover officers
employed by the special division of the state police department and
that he had studied the file before coming to court. He said that all
entries in the file were made by the person who selected its personnel
and issued their assignments when the special division was formed
and as new personnel were added.

The prosecution then offers to have the witness testify that the file
contains no mention of the defendant. The defendant's attorney objects.
Which of the following additional facts and inferences, if it was the
only one true, would be most likely to result in the admission of the
witness's testimony?

(A) The file itself is unavailable.

1178

(B) The person who makes the entries in the file is unavailable.

(C) The person who made the entries in the file is dead.

(D) The personnel file is available for inspection by the public.

165. The homeowner, who owned a home in a residential development,

decided to have his driveway paved. He called the plaintiff, a licensed
contractor who specialized in residential driveways, and asked for an
estimate on the job. Although the standard market price to pave a
driveway the size of the homeowner's was $2,750, the plaintiff was
willing to do the job for $2,500 since business was slow. The
homeowner agreed to hire him to do the job at that price and filled out
and signed a detailed work order for the plaintiff's work crew. Since
the 
homeowner was planning to go on vacation for two weeks, he and the
plaintiff agreed that the job would be finished by the time the
homeowner returned.

Three days later, the plaintiff's work crew went out to do the job
described in the homeowner's work order. By mistake, they paved the
neighbor's driveway, which was identical to the homeowner's except
that it was on a different street. The neighbor was out of town at the
time. The job cost the plaintiff $2,600 in labor and materials and
increased the value of the neighbor's realty by $2,100. The homeowner
did not communicate with the plaintiff while away on vacation. When
he returned and discovered that his driveway had not yet been paved,
he demanded that the plaintiff perform as agreed, but the plaintiff
refused.

After the driveway was paved, the neighbor promised to pay the
plaintiff $2,000 for the job. In a jurisdiction that adopts the view of the
Restatement (2d) of Contracts, if the neighbor then refused to pay and
the plaintiff sued him for breaching his promise, which of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one true,
would be most likely to result in a judgment for the plaintiff?

(A) When the neighbor promised to pay, the neighbor knew that the

plaintiff had already paved his driveway.

(B) When the neighbor promised to pay, the neighbor did not know that

the plaintiff had already paved his driveway.

(C) The neighbor decided to have his driveway paved before speaking

1179

with the plaintiff.

(D) The neighbor did not decide to have his driveway paved until

speaking with the plaintiff.

166. The landlord leased an apartment to a new tenant. The lease provided
that the tenant could not assign or sublease without the landlord's
consent. Soon thereafter, the tenant assigned the lease to his friend. The
landlord accepted the friend's first rent payment without any protest.

The landlord then realized he didn't like the idea of having the friend
as a tenant, so he declared the lease terminated. May he do so?

(A) Yes, because assignments were prohibited by the lease.

(B) Yes, because the landlord protested within a reasonable time.

(C) Yes, because the landlord had a superior property interest to the

tenant and the friend.

(D) No, because the landlord waived his right to terminate the lease.

167. The defendant suffered from severe anxiety. One day, he had a job
interview at a new company. Because he was so nervous about the
interview, he took three times the amount of anxiety pills that were
prescribed for him and drank a bottle of beer. The pills and the beer
made him severely intoxicated. On the way to the interview, the
defendant was driving his car when a man in another car ran a red
light. The resulting collision ended up killing the man. A police
investigation showed the defendant was driving at the correct speed
and obeyed all other traffic regulations.

The defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter. How
should the court rule on the involuntary manslaughter charge?

(A) Guilty, because the defendant was grossly negligent in taking three
times the drugs prescribed for him and drinking a beer before
driving.

(B) Guilty, because the defendant was negligent under the totality of the

circumstances.

(C) Guilty, because driving while intoxicated is malum in se.

(D) Not guilty.

168. The defendant's husband owed money to the plaintiff. This was

1180

evidenced by a promissory note. When the note became due, the
defendant signed the back of it and promised to pay the note if her
husband did not. In return, the plaintiff promised he would not put the
note in his bank for immediate collection. Instead, he agreed to “hold it
until the time I want my money.” The plaintiff did not collect on the
note for two years. The plaintiff then sued the defendant based on her
endorsement. If the court does not enforce the agreement, it will be
because

(A) there was no consideration for the promise.

(B) the plaintiff did not detrimentally rely upon the promise.

(C) the defendant's husband was the primary debtor.

(D) the agreement was unconscionable.

169. On March 1, the seller entered into a written agreement with a licensed
real estate broker. By its terms, the seller agreed to pay the broker a
commission equal to 6 percent of the price if, prior to April 15, the
broker procured a buyer ready, willing, and able to pay $50,000 for
the seller's realty. In return, the broker agreed to make reasonable
efforts to sell it.

After the agreement was executed, the broker advertised the seller's
property and showed it to several prospective buyers. On April 10,
the buyer signed a document agreeing to purchase the seller's realty for
$50,000 but stating that her agreement was contingent upon her success
in obtaining the necessary financing. The same day, the broker
presented to the seller the document that the buyer had signed. The
seller read it, thought for a moment, and handed it back to the broker,
saying, “I won't even consider a deal built around a contingency.”
Although the broker protested that the agreement between him and the
seller did not specify a sale without contingencies, the seller refused
to discuss the matter any further.

On April 11, the broker informed the buyer of the seller's response.
The buyer then obtained a cashier's check for $50,000 payable to the
seller. She delivered the check to the broker, together with a signed
document in which she agreed to purchase the seller's realty for that
sum. On April 14, the broker presented the second document to the
seller with the cashier's check. The seller said, “I've changed my
mind. I'm not interested in selling.”

1181

If the buyer institutes a proceeding against the seller for an order
directing the seller to sell her the realty for $50,000, the court should
find for

(A) the seller, because he did not agree to sell the realty to the buyer.

(B) the seller, because his attempt to orally modify his written

agreement with the broker was invalid.

(C) the buyer, because she can show that the realty is unique.

(D) the buyer, because her written agreement to purchase was delivered

with the cashier's check prior to April 15.

170. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the plaintiff claimed

that the defendant breached a contract to market the plaintiff's products.
At trial, the plaintiff testified that she and the defendant had reached an
agreement at a conference held in the office of the plaintiff's attorney
on October 15. She stated that she and the defendant discussed five
separate products on that occasion. On direct examination of the
plaintiff, the attorney asked her to name the products that had been
discussed. The plaintiff named four of them but said she could not
remember the fifth. After having them properly marked for
identification, the plaintiff's attorney offered to show the plaintiff notes
that the attorney had made during the conference, asking whether
looking at them would refresh the plaintiff's recollection.

The defendant's attorney did not object to the plaintiff's looking at the
notes, and the plaintiff stated that looking at the notes refreshed her
recollection. After looking at the notes, the plaintiff named the fifth
product, and the plaintiff's attorney then offered the notes in evidence.
If the defendant's attorney objects to admission of the notes in
evidence, the objection should be

(A) overruled, because the notes constitute a business record.

(B) overruled, because the plaintiff used the notes to refresh her

recollection while testifying.

(C) sustained, because the notes are hearsay not within any exception.

(D) sustained, because the notes constitute an attorney's work product.

171. A state law empowers any municipality within the state to collect a

property tax from its landowners if a plan to do so is proposed by its
governing body and approved by a majority of its eligible voters. The

1182

township is a municipality governed by a Township Council. Pursuant
to the above law, the Township Council proposed a property tax plan
and scheduled a special election for August 15 to submit the plan for
voter approval. The Township Council declared that only persons
owning land within the township were eligible to vote in the special
election and that eligible voters were required to register for that
purpose at the Township Hall between the hours of 1 P.M. and 3 P.M. on
Tuesday, July 15. The constitutionality of the special election was
challenged in an appropriate proceeding by a petitioner with standing.

The petitioner argued that the registration schedule was
discriminatory, proving that a substantial percentage of persons who
owned land in the township were males who commuted to work in a
city 45 miles away and were unable to register during the scheduled
hours without missing a day's work and incurring a loss of income. In
response, the Township Council argued that the registration schedule
had a rational basis, proving that its timing allowed the process to be
carried out with volunteer labor that would save the Township the cost
of hiring special registration personnel. If these are the only arguments
made, the court should declare the registration schedule invalid
because

(A) it discriminates against commuters on the basis of their lifestyle.

(B) it discriminates on the basis of wealth by excluding those who

cannot afford to lose a day's work.

(C) it results in benign sex discrimination.

(D) the right to vote is a fundamental right.

172. The landlord, the owner of a seven-story office building, leased the

entire sixth floor to an attorney for a period of five years by a written
lease that fixed the rent at $2,000 per month. There were only two
offices on the sixth floor, identified as Office 6A and Office 6B. A
clause in the lease provided that in the event it ever became necessary
to determine how the rent payments were apportioned, it was
understood that $900 of each month's rent was to be applied to Office
6A, $900 was to be applied to Office 6B, and $200 was to be applied
to the hallways and other common areas. The lease prohibited
assignment by the attorney without the landlord's written permission
and provided that such permission would not be unreasonably
withheld.

1183

One year after executing the lease, the attorney entered into a written
agreement with a second attorney. Under its terms, the second attorney
was to occupy Office 6A for the balance of the attorney's term at a
monthly rental of $1,500 payable to the attorney. The second attorney
was an attorney with a better reputation and a more lucrative practice
than the first attorney's.

The landlord consented to the arrangement between the two attorneys,
but one month before the term expired, the second attorney vacated the
premises and made no further payments. After the second attorney
moved out, the office that the second attorney had occupied remained
vacant. For the final month of the lease term, the first attorney paid
only $1,100 to the landlord, although the landlord demanded an
additional $900. In an appropriate proceeding, the landlord can
collect $900 from

(A) the first attorney only.

(B) the second attorney only.

(C) Either attorney.

(D) Neither attorney.

173. A woman sued a company in federal district court in State A after she
was injured by one of the company's products. After trial, the jury
ruled in favor of the woman and awarded her damages.

If the trial judge believed the compensatory damages awarded by the
jury were inadequate because the jury was prejudiced against the
woman, what should she do?

(A) Amend the judgment through additur.

(B) Offer the defendant a choice between a higher damage award or a

new trial.

(C) Order a new trial.

(D) Enter judgment as a matter of law.

174. The owner of one piece of land granted an easement to his neighbor,

the owner of the adjacent piece of land. The easement allowed the
neighbor to use a 12-foot-wide strip of the owner's land to drive his
car from his property to the public highway. The strip crossed a
bridge, but the easement document was silent regarding any repairs to

1184

it. After the grant of the easement, the bridge washed out. The neighbor
asked the owner who granted him the easement to repair the bridge,
and he refused to do so. Does the owner who granted the easement
have a duty to repair the bridge?

(A) No, because the owner of the servient estate is not required to

repair or maintain the property used in the easement.

(B) No, but he will have to reimburse his neighbor if his neighbor

chooses to repair it.

(C) Yes, because without the bridge, the neighbor has no way to get to

the public highway.

(D) Yes, because he expressly granted an easement for his neighbor to

be able to reach the highway.

175. The plaintiff was hired as a probationary employee by an agency of the
state pursuant to a written contract. The contract provided that at the
end of one year, the parties could agree to renew the contract for an
additional one-year period, but that either party could, without cause,
elect not to renew.

Eleven months after hiring him, the agency informed the plaintiff in
writing that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the year.
The plaintiff asked the agency for a hearing on his fitness to be
rehired, but his request was denied. The plaintiff subsequently
instituted a proceeding to challenge the decision of the agency on the
ground that its failure to hold a hearing before deciding not to rehire
him violated his right to due process.

If it was the only one true, which of the following additional facts or
inferences would be most likely to lead to an order requiring the
agency to hold a hearing before deciding not to rehire the plaintiff?

(A) During the same year, the agency held hearings before deciding

whether to rehire certain other probationary employees.

(B) The decision not to rehire the plaintiff was based in part on the fact
that, while employed by the agency, he had actively campaigned for
a political candidate.

(C) The decision not to rehire the plaintiff was likely to damage the

plaintiff's reputation.

1185

(D) The job held by the plaintiff was vital to the efficient operation of

the agency.

176. While the defendant and his wife were standing in line outside a movie
theater, the defendant whispered to his wife that he had committed a
series of robberies the previous week. The defendant was
subsequently arrested and charged with the robberies in a jurisdiction
that holds that confidential marital communications are privileged.

The wife is called as a prosecution witness, and the prosecutor
attempts to question her about the statement that the defendant made to
her while they were waiting in the movie line. Which of the following
statements is most correct?

(A) The court should exclude this testimony if the wife is willing to

testify but the defendant objects to her testimony.

(B) The court should exclude this testimony even if the defendant and

his wife make no objection to it.

(C) The court should exclude this testimony even if the defendant and 

his wife make no objection to it, 
or if the wife is willing to testify but the defendant objects to her
testimony.

(D) The court should admit the testimony.

177. The defendant showed his silver coins to the plaintiff and asked

whether the plaintiff would be interested in trading them for chickens.
After inspecting the coins, the defendant and the plaintiff placed them
in a bag that they sealed together and left with a banker whom they
both knew. Then, in a writing signed by both of them, they agreed to the
trade.

Pursuant to the terms of their agreement, the plaintiff was to deliver
6,000 fryer chickens to the defendant on July 1, at which time the bag
of coins would be turned over to the plaintiff as payment in full. In
May, weather conditions were such that the price of fryer chickens
increased to three times what it had been when the agreement was
signed.

In May, the plaintiff notified the defendant that because of the increase
in the price of chickens, the plaintiff would not be able to accept the
bag of coins as payment for 6,000 fryer chickens in July. The

1186

defendant immediately sold the coins to a third person. On July 1, the
plaintiff attempted to deliver 6,000 fryer chickens to the defendant, but
the defendant refused to accept delivery. If the plaintiff asserts a claim
against the defendant for breach of contract, the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the plaintiff said that she would not accept

the coins as payment for the chickens.

(B) the defendant, because the defendant's sale of the coins has resulted

in the defendant's prospective inability to perform.

(C) the plaintiff, because the sale of the coins by the defendant has

made performance by the defendant impossible.

(D) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff tendered the chickens as required

by the contract.

178. While out hunting for wolves, the defendants saw a large furry animal

that they believed was a wolf running through the trees. The defendants
opened fire, killing the creature. When they got closer, they realized
they had just shot a dog that was owned by a local farmer. The dog did
in fact look exactly like a wolf. The farmer sued the defendants for
damages, and the defendants countered that they shot the dog by
mistake and were acting in good faith. What result?

(A) The defendants are not liable for the farmer's damages because

their mistake was made in good faith.

(B) The defendants are not liable for the farmer's damages because

their mistake was reasonable.

(C) The defendants are liable for the farmer's damages because it is

unreasonable to mistake a dog for a wolf.

(D) The defendants are liable for the farmer's damages even though they

may have been acting in good faith.

179. After many residents of the state complained of being annoyed by calls
received from robocall computers, the state legislature enacted a
statute that prohibited operating such a device from within the state.

The company, a manufacturing company doing business in the state,
planned to use the robocall computer to market its products within the
state. After passage of the law, the company attempted to hire an out-
of-state company to set up a robocall computer system connected to
phone lines outside the state for the purpose of making calls to

1187

telephones within the state. When the company learned that the cost of
doing so would far exceed the cost of setting up such a system inside
the state, the company challenged the constitutionality of the state law.

The company's only claim is that the statute violates the First
Amendment protection of freedom of expression. The company's most
effective argument in support of that conclusion is that the statute is

(A) overbroad because it could interfere with non-commercial

communications as well as with commercial communications.

(B) content-related because it is more likely that the telephone
solicitation computer would be used for commercial
communications than for non-commercial communications.

(C) likely to have a chilling effect on expression because of the

increased cost of using the telephone solicitation computer from
locations outside the state.

(D) not justified because prohibiting use of the telephone robocall

computer from locations within the states does not directly advance
a substantial government interest.

180. The farmer was the owner of a small farm that had been in his family

for many generations and which had become a well-known community
landmark. The farmer had a son and a daughter. Because the farmer
was advanced in age, he was concerned about what would happen to
the property after his death. He wanted to keep it in the family for as
long as possible, and he wanted the son to have the use of it throughout
his lifetime.

The farmer died, leaving a will that devised the property “to my son
for life, but if within 40 years my son attempts to sell or mortgage his
interest, to my daughter for life.” If, in an appropriate proceeding, the
son challenges the validity of the restrictions on his estate, his most
effective argument would be that the restrictions

(A) constitute a disabling restraint on alienation.

(B) constitute a forfeiturial restraint on alienation.

(C) constitute a promissory restraint on alienation.

(D) violate the Rule Against Perpetuities.

181. A police officer was going door-to-door in a neighborhood handing

1188

out flyers related to several recent burglaries. A homeowner invited
the police officer in for some coffee. The police officer sat down in
the living room while the homeowner went into the kitchen to get the
coffee. While the officer was sitting there, he noticed a large gun case
on the floor. The case wasn't locked, so he opened it. Inside was a
fully automatic machine gun, which was unlawful in the state. The
police officer arrested the homeowner. The homeowner moved to have
the evidence against her suppressed.

Should the evidence be suppressed?

(A) Yes, because the homeowner was not in the room when the officer

opened the case.

(B) Yes, because the homeowner did not give the officer permission to

open the case.

(C) No, because the homeowner had invited the officer into her home.

(D) No, because the illegality of the evidence was readily apparent.

182. After determining that the health insurance plan could be operated less

expensively if it did not include persons over the age of 65, the state
legislature passed a compulsory retirement law requiring state
employees to retire at the age of 65.

The plaintiff, an employee of the state, sued, claiming that she reached
65 several years after the passing of the new law.

The plaintiff's only argument was that the mandatory retirement law
violated the Obligation of Contracts Clause of Article I of the United
States Constitution. If it was the only one true, which of the following
additional facts or inferences would best support the plaintiff's claim?

(A) The plaintiff was a state employee prior to the time the mandatory

retirement law was passed.

(B) The plaintiff borrowed money for the purchase of a retirement

home, planning to pay it back from his salary as a state employee.

(C) The plaintiff is as physically fit as the average person who is 60

years of age.

(D) The plaintiff's job as a state employee does not require any

physical labor or strain.

1189

183. After executing a contract with the defendant, the plaintiff advertised

that he would be showing the defendant's world-famous hog at the state
fair. All his advertising emphasized that the hog, the American
champion, would be exhibited at the fair. On June 20, the hog
contracted a highly contagious and frequently fatal disease of hogs.
The defendant notified the plaintiff on June 22 that, because of the
disease, he could not exhibit the hog as agreed. When the plaintiff
advised the public that the hog would not be appearing, many people
who had planned to purchase tickets changed their minds and did not
do so. The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim against the defendant
for damages resulting from the defendant's refusal to exhibit the hog as
agreed.

Which of the following additional facts, if it were the only one true,
would be most likely to result in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff?

(A) On May 1, the defendant was aware that many hogs in the area had

contracted the hog disease.

(B) On June 21, the state learned that the hog had contracted the hog
disease and issued an order prohibiting the exhibition of the hog.

(C) On June 22, the defendant owned a hog with qualities equivalent to

the other hogs.

(D) On the day of the trial, the plaintiff could prove exactly how much
revenue the plaintiff lost as a result of the defendant's failure to
exhibit the hog.

184. The tenant leased a parcel of real estate from the landlord for one year
at a monthly rent of $2,000 with an option to buy it for a specified
price at the termination of the lease. After moving onto the realty, the
tenant erected a storage building on it. The construction cost of the
building was $6,000, but when it was completed, its value was
$8,000. The tenant's employer subsequently transferred him to a
company office located in a different state. As a result, the tenant
vacated the realty four months before the expiration of the lease,
advising the landlord that he would not exercise his purchase option.
On the same day, the landlord conveyed the property to the buyer.

The buyer moved onto the realty on the day the tenant vacated it, and
all parties agreed that therefore the tenant would have no further
obligation to pay rent. If the tenant wishes to remove the storage

1190

building, but the landlord and the buyer object, which of the following
statements is correct?

(A) The landlord and the buyer may prevent removal of the building by
declaring it to be realty and tendering its reasonable value to the
tenant.

(B) If a court prevents the tenant from removing the building, declaring
it has been annexed to the realty, the tenant is entitled to receive its
reasonable value from the landlord or the buyer.

(C) The landlord and the buyer may prevent the removal of the building
by declaring it to be realty and tendering its reasonable value to the
tenant, and if a court prevents the tenant from removing the
building, declaring it has been annexed to the realty, the tenant is
entitled to receive its reasonable value from the landlord or buyer.

(D) If the building has become part of the realty, the landlord and the

buyer owe nothing.

185. The company is the manufacturer of an agricultural insecticide. Since
the county in which the company is located is primarily devoted to
farming, the company has manufactured the agricultural insecticide at
its factory there for the past 50 years. Although the insecticide is an
important product commonly used by farmers for the control of an
insect highly destructive to food crops, only three other companies
have a similar product.

Due to the manufacture of the insecticide, fumes that issue from the
company factory frequently have an unpleasant odor. These fumes
cause no physical harm to persons, property, or crops, but residents of
the county frequently complain about the foul smell. All the factories
that manufacture a product similar to the insecticide produce the same
odor.

The farmer began growing crops on a field near the company factory
less than a year ago. The farmer leases the field from its owner in
return for a percentage of his crop. When he telephoned the company
to complain about the bad smell emanating from its factory, a company
official told him that nothing could be done about it.

The farmer asserts a claim against the company based on private
nuisance, seeking damages for discomfort that he experiences as a

1191

result of the bad smell produced by the company's factory. Which one
of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one
true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the company?

(A) There is no other factory within 1,000 miles that manufactures a

product similar to the insecticide.

(B) The farmer does not own realty in or reside in the county.

(C) It is impossible to manufacture a product similar to the insecticide

without producing a bad smell.

(D) The farmer's discomfort does not differ substantially from the
discomfort experienced by other residents of the county.

186. At the jury trial of an action by the bank against the defendant on a

promissory note, the defendant testified that the signature on the note
was not his. An employee of the bank testified that she recognized the
signature as the defendant's.

The defendant's attorney asserts that the promissory note is hearsay.
The bank's most effective response to that assertion would be that

(A) the promissory note is a business record.

(B) the promissory note is an original document.

(C) the promissory note is not being offered to prove that any statement

that it contains is true.

(D) the defendant is in court.

187. Three men all agreed to carry loaded fully automatic machine guns for
a robbery of a pharmacy. The men entered the pharmacy, and to scare
everyone, one of the men fired about 30 bullets into the ceiling. The
pharmacy was in an antique building with a tin ceiling. A bullet
ricocheted off the metal and killed a customer. All three men were
arrested and charged with murder. The jurisdiction does not apply the
felony-murder rule. What is the most severe crime committed by the
two men who did not shoot into the ceiling?

(A) Conspiracy.

(B) Involuntary manslaughter.

(C) Voluntary manslaughter.

(D) Depraved-indifference murder.

1192

188. A stockbroker brought an action in federal district court in State A

against a car salesman after the stockbroker was injured while taking a
test drive in a new car he was thinking about buying. The stockbroker,
a citizen of State A, sought $1 million in damages. The salesman was a
citizen of State B. The salesman brought a counterclaim against the
stockbroker for damages he claimed he received during the same
accident. The salesman joined to the counterclaim the car dealer he
was working for at the time of the accident. The car dealer was a
citizen of State B. The salesman claimed the car dealer and the
stockbroker were both liable to him for $50,000 in damages based on
the accident. The salesman also joined to the counterclaim a claim for
breach of contract against the car dealer because the car dealer fired
him shortly after the accident.

May the court hear the salesman's claim for breach of contract?

(A) Yes, because the claim is part of the same case or controversy.

(B) Yes, because the federal court would have supplemental

jurisdiction over the related claim.

(C) No, because the counterclaim would contain additional facts from

the main claim.

(D) No, because the salesman and the dealer are citizens of the same

state.

189. An astronaut, who is a resident of the Western District of State A, sued
an engineer, who was a resident of the Eastern District of State B, and
a videogame designer, who was a resident of the Southern District of
State C, in federal district court for damages related to an automobile
accident. The accident occurred in the Western District of State D. The
astronaut brought suit in the Western District of State A. After the
defendants submitted their answers, they realized venue was improper
and moved to have the case transferred to the Western District of State
D. However, the district judge found that in the interest of
convenience, the district court in the Western District of State A should
hear the case.

Is venue proper in the Western District of State A?

(A) No, because neither the defendants nor the accident have any

connection to the Western District of A.

1193

(B) No, because neither defendant is a citizen of State A.

(C) Yes, because the defendants have already filed their answers.

(D) Yes, because venue decisions are discretionary.

190. The defendant and the victim are adults. During an argument, the

defendant slammed a glass door against the victim, causing the victim
to sustain serious cuts on her hand. After the victim received medical
treatment for her injuries, she spoke to the defendant's mother about it.
The victim told the mother that she was thinking of suing the defendant
for her medical expenses, but that if the mother would agree to pay the
victim $250, the victim would make no claim against the defendant for
medical expenses. The mother agreed in writing that she would do so.

Two weeks later, the defendant was prosecuted criminally as a result
of the injuries that he had inflicted on the victim. The victim told the
defendant's mother that the prosecutor had asked the victim to testify
against the defendant at the proceeding. The mother begged her not to.
Finally, the victim said that if the mother gave her an additional $1,000
for her pain and suffering, she would not testify against the defendant.
The defendant's mother orally agreed to do so.

The defendant's mother paid $250 to the victim, but refused to pay an
additional $1,000. If the victim asserts a claim against the defendant's
mother on account of the mother's failure to pay the additional $1,000,
which of the following would be the mother's most effective argument
in defense?

(A) The defendant's mother was not legally obligated to pay for damage

done by her adult son.

(B) The defendant's mother's promise to pay an additional $1,000 to the

victim was not supported by consideration.

(C) The defendant's mother's payment of $250 to the victim was an

accord and satisfaction.

(D) The defendant's mother's promise to pay the debt of the defendant

was not in writing.

191. Following her indictment by a grand jury for bank robbery, the
defendant voluntarily surrendered at police headquarters. After
booking her, police officers advised the defendant that she had a right
to remain silent, that anything she said might be used against her, that

1194

she was entitled to have an attorney present during questioning, and
that if she could not afford an attorney, one would be furnished without
cost to her. The defendant said that she did not wish to answer any
questions until her attorney arrived.

The officers went to lunch and returned to headquarters an hour later.
Upon their return, they ordered the defendant to appear in a lineup for
identification purposes in connection with the bank robbery. At first,
the defendant refused. When the officer threatened to use force to
compel her appearance, however, the defendant appeared without
resisting. Witnesses at the lineup identified her as the bank robber.

Following the lineup, the officers asked the defendant whether she
knew anything about a series of residential burglaries. Although they
did not think that she had committed the burglaries, they thought that
she might know the people who had. The defendant admitted
participating in the burglaries, however. She was subsequently
prosecuted for bank robbery and the burglaries.

If the defendant moves to exclude evidence that she admitted
participating in the burglaries, her motion should be

(A) denied, because the police did not suspect her of being involved in

the burglaries when they asked her about them.

(B) denied, because she received Miranda warnings before being

questioned about the burglaries.

(C) granted, because she stated that she did not wish to answer any

questions until her attorney arrived and did not in any other manner
waive her Miranda rights.

(D) granted, because the police did not advise her that she was

suspected of committing the burglaries before they questioned her
about them.

192. By a properly executed and recorded deed, the landowner conveyed a

parcel of real estate with a building on it as follows:

to the church for so long as the land is used by the church for church
purposes;  and  when  the  land  ceases  to  be  so  used,  to  the  hospital  for
so long as the land shall be used by the hospital for hospital purposes;
and  when  the  land  ceases  to  be  so  used,  to  my  son  if  my  son  is  then
living.

1195

The church moved onto the real estate, using the building as a house of
worship.

Five years after the landowner's conveyance, the size of the
congregation of the church increased, creating the need for more
space. As a result, church officials sold the realty, planning to use the
proceeds to buy a bigger church, and executed a deed purporting to
convey the realty to a real estate development company. In subsequent
litigation to determine the rights of the church, the hospital, and the
company, which of the parties should be found to have a present
possessory interest in the realty?

(A) The company, because the church plans to use the proceeds of the

sale to purchase realty for church use.

(B) The company, because the hospital's interest is void under the Rule

Against Perpetuities.

(C) The hospital, because the conveyance to the company terminated

the estate of the church.

(D) The church, because its conveyance to the company was invalid

under the grant from the landowner.

193. After a nuclear power plant was built in the state, the state passed the
Nuclear Waste Act. The Act regulates the storage of radioactive
wastes and authorizes the construction of radioactive waste storage
facilities at specified locations within the state. Section 40 of the Act
provides that “No radioactive waste storage facility in the state shall
store or accept for storage any radioactive waste resulting from
activities conducted more than five miles from said storage facility.”
All storage facilities within the state that are authorized by the Nuclear
Waste Act are located more than five miles from the state line.

The constitutionality of Section 40 is challenged on the sole ground
that it violates the Commerce Clause. Which of the following
additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one true, would be
most likely to result in a conclusion that Section 40 is constitutional?

(A) Prohibiting the storage of radioactive wastes generated outside the
state reduces the expense of operating nuclear power plants within
the state.

(B) The transportation of radioactive wastes within the state over

1196

distances greater than five miles would pose a significant health
and safety hazard to state residents.

(C) There are only a few locations within the state where radioactive

wastes can be stored safely.

(D) There are many locations outside the state where radioactive

wastes can be stored safely.

194. The security guard of a warehouse was making his rounds after closing

time one night when he found the defendant walking around inside the
warehouse. When the guard asked him what he was doing there, the
defendant replied that he had been driving past the warehouse when he
noticed that its door was open, and that he had entered to report this to
the guard. The guard called the police, and the defendant was arrested
and charged with violating a statute providing that “any person
entering the building of another for the purpose of committing a crime
therein is guilty of burglary.”

At the defendant's trial, the prosecutor tried to prove that the
defendant's van, parked outside the warehouse at the time of the
defendant's arrest, had license plates on it that had been stolen from an
out-of-state vehicle the day before the defendant's arrest.

The prosecutor subsequently offered evidence that the defendant had
previously been convicted of a crime other than burglary. Which of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it was the only one true,
would be most likely to result in the exclusion of that evidence?

(A) The defendant testified in his own behalf at the burglary trial and

stated that he had never been convicted of a crime.

(B) The defendant did not testify in his own behalf at the burglary trial.

(C) The defendant's prior conviction was for involuntary manslaughter.

(D) The defendant's prior conviction was rendered in the court of

another state.

195. A man sued a boxer in federal district court in the Western District of
State A for injuries the man sustained during a bar fight. The boxer's
attorney wanted to get a copy of the police report. The police
department was located in the Western District of State A, the same
District in which the fight occurred.

1197

How can the boxer's attorney get a copy of the police report?

(A) Serve a request to produce documents on the police department.

(B) Cause the court clerk to issue a subpoena duces tecum on the police

department.

(C) Serve a notice of deposition on the police officer that wrote the

report.

(D) Serve interrogatories on the police officer that wrote the report.

196. The plaintiff, a dentist, owned an apparatus for putting patients to sleep
while she operated on their teeth. The apparatus consisted of two
canisters, one filled with oxygen and the other filled with anesthetic
gas. By manipulating valves attached to the canisters, the plaintiff used
the apparatus to mix and administer a proper combination of gases to
patients. Noticing that one of the valves was beginning to wear out, the
plaintiff sent the apparatus to its manufacturer for repairs. After fixing
the valve, the manufacturer negligently filled the oxygen canister with
anesthetic gas and the anesthetic gas canister with oxygen.

After the manufacturer returned the apparatus to the plaintiff, she
attempted to use it on a patient. While treating the patient, the plaintiff
decided that it was necessary to administer pure oxygen and
manipulated the valves accordingly. Because of the manufacturer's
error in refilling the oxygen canister with anesthetic gas, however, the
plaintiff administered pure anesthetic instead. As a result, the patient
died in the plaintiff's office.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the manufacturer for mental
suffering that she experienced as a result of the patient's death in her
office, which of the following would be the plaintiff's most effective
argument in support of her claim?

(A) The manufacturer's error was outrageous because it created a high

probability of serious harm.

(B) It was likely that the manufacturer's error would lead the plaintiff to

experience mental suffering.

(C) The plaintiff assumed all risks associated with using anesthetic gas.

(D) There was substantial certainty that the plaintiff would use the

apparatus on a patient.

1198

197. A man told his friend, a druggist, that he was planning to kill his wife

and asked the druggist to help him by furnishing a poison. Although the
druggist did not actually intend to help the man kill his wife, he said
that he would because he did not want his friend to be angry at him.
The druggist gave the man a commonly used antibiotic, telling him that
it was a deadly and undetectable poison. The druggist knew that the
antibiotic was not supposed to be dispensed without a prescription and
that about 2 percent of the people who received it developed an
allergic reaction to it, but he did not believe that it would hurt the wife.
That night while the wife was asleep, the man injected her with the
antibiotic that the druggist had given him. Because she was allergic to
the drug, the wife became seriously ill and nearly died.

If the man is prosecuted for conspiracy to murder his wife, which of
the following would be his most effective argument in defense?

(A) His wife did not die.

(B) The druggist did not believe that the wife would die.

(C) The drug that the man gave his wife was not likely to cause her

death.

(D) The inchoate crime and the substantive crime merge when the
defendant's overt act brings him or her substantially close to
achieving his or her intended result.

198. The defendant was arrested and charged in a state court with the

unlawful possession of a dangerous drug. As his defense, the defendant
asserted that he was an undercover officer employed by the Special
Division of the State Police Department and that he had possessed the
drug lawfully as part of an undercover assignment. During the
presentation of its case, the prosecution called the witness, an official
of the State Police Department. The witness testified that he was the
custodian of a personnel file that contained the names of all
undercover officers employed by the Special Division of the State
Police Department and that he had studied the file before coming to
court. He said that all entries in the file were made by the person who
selected its personnel and issued their assignments when the Special
Division was formed and as new personnel were added.

The prosecution offers the file itself into evidence for the purpose of
showing that it contains no mention whatsoever of the defendant. If the

1199

defendant's attorney objects, the personnel file should be

(A) admitted as a business record.

(B) admitted as past recollection recorded.

(C) excluded, because government documents may only be used against

the government.

(D) excluded, because it calls for an inference to be drawn from

negative evidence.

199. A company brought a claim for violations of federal securities laws
against a bank in federal district court. The case was tried before a
jury. The company's case consisted of one witness: the company
president, who presented a few emails that allegedly proved the
company had been harmed by insider trading committed by the bank.
The bank then presented its case, which included dozens of documents
and several expert witnesses regarding the financial actions taken by
the bank. The experts all agreed that the bank's actions were legal. The
case was then submitted to the jury. The jury found in favor of the
company. The bank made a motion for judgment as a matter of law,
arguing there was no way a reasonable jury could have ruled in favor
of the company.

How should the court rule?

(A) Deny the motion, because the bank provided no new evidence to

dispute the claim.

(B) Deny the motion, because the bank did not move for judgment as a

matter of law before the case was submitted to the jury.

(C) Grant the motion, based on the 

insufficiency of the company's evidence.

(D) Grant the motion, because the jury's decision was clearly

erroneous.

200. A pipe company filed a complaint in state court in State A for breach

of contract against a builder. The company did not serve the builder
then, but emailed a “courtesy copy” of the complaint to one of the
builder's vice presidents. The company officially served the builder
two weeks later. Twenty-nine days after service, but 44 days after
receiving the email, the builder removed the case to federal district
court in State A. The company moved to remand the case to state court.

1200

How should the court rule?

(A) Deny the motion, because the builder removed the claim within 30

days after it was served.

(B) Deny the motion, because the “courtesy copy” was not sent by

certified mail.

(C) Grant the motion, because the builder did not remove the claim

within 30 days of receiving notice of the complaint.

(D) Grant the motion, because the builder did not challenge notice

when it received the initial email.

PRACTICE MBE — ANSWERS TO A.M.
QUESTIONS

1. D A private citizen or police officer is privileged to use whatever non-
deadly force he or she reasonably believes is necessary to prevent the
escape  of  a  criminal  from  a  crime.  Although  there  is  some  doubt
whether the force used by the man against the robber was reasonable,
or indeed whether it was non-deadly, D is the only argument listed that
could possibly result in an acquittal.

In some jurisdictions, a person defending another against a threat of
immediate bodily harm is privileged to use whatever force the person
being  defended  would  have  been  privileged  to  use.  In  other
jurisdictions,  a  person  defending  another  against  a  threat  of
immediate bodily harm is privileged to use the force that reasonably
appears necessary to the defendant himself or herself. Both A and B
are  incorrect,  however,  because  the  robber  was  in  the  process  of
running away at the time of the man's blow, and therefore the man was
not  defending  the  woman  against  a  threat  of  bodily  harm.  A  person
who  owns  or  is  in  charge  of  property  may  use  reasonable  force  to
protect it. This may privilege the use of force to stop a person who is
in the process of unlawfully carrying that property off. C is incorrect,
however,  because  the  man  was  not  the  owner  or  custodian  of  the
woman's handbag and therefore had no privilege to protect it.

2. D Under FRE 611(b), as well as the common law majority rule, cross-
examination  is  limited  to  matters  to  which  the  witness  testified  on
direct  examination.  Because  the  witness  did  not  testify  about  the
contract,  the  question  asked  by  the  defendant's  attorney  probably
exceeds the scope of cross-examination. Since the trial court is given
discretion  in  determining  how  far  the  scope  of  cross-examination
extends, it is not certain that the court would sustain the objection on
this ground. Of all the arguments listed, however, the one set forth in D
is  the  only  one  that  could  possibly  be  effective  in  support  of  the
objection.

A is incorrect for two reasons: First, the witness was called by the
plaintiff, and therefore she is not the defendant's witness, and second,
under  FRE  607,  a  party  may  impeach  its  own  witness.  A  leading
question  is  one  that  contains  a  suggestion  that  would  cause  the
ordinary  person  to  believe  that  the  questioner  desires  one  answer

1203

instead of another. B  is  incorrect  because  the  question  asked  by  the
defendant's attorney contains no such suggestion and because leading
questions  are  permitted  on  cross-examination.  Argumentative
questions are those that are used to emphasize some point to the jury
rather than to elicit information. Although argumentative questions are
improper,  C  is  incorrect  because  the  question  asked  by  the
defendant's attorney did not seek to emphasize any particular point to
the jury.

3. B For the purpose of discovering weapons or preventing the destruction
of evidence, officers may make an incidental search of a person who
has been lawfully arrested. Thus, if the defendant's arrest was lawful,
the  search  of  her  person  was  lawful  as  an  incident  to  that  arrest.  An
officer may make an arrest without a warrant if there is probable cause
to believe that the person arrested has committed or is in the process
of committing a felony. Thus, if the defendant's proximity to the trunk
gave  the  officers  probable  cause  to  believe  that  she  was  guilty  of
possessing cocaine, her arrest and incidental search were lawful.

Probable cause means a belief that the defendant is guilty, supported
by  facts  that  would  lead  a  reasonable  person  to  entertain  such  a
belief. While it is not certain that the officers had probable cause to
believe  the  defendant  guilty,  the  argument  set  forth  in  B  is  the  only
one  listed  that  might  provide  the  prosecution  with  an  effective
argument in response to the defendant's motion.

It  is  sometimes  said  that  evidence  discovered  by  violating  a
defendant's rights is inadmissible because it is “fruit of the poisonous
tree.” A is incorrect because evidence so classified is excluded, not
admitted. Many states hold that officers executing a warrant to search
premises  are  entitled  to  frisk  all  persons  present  for  weapons.  The
frisk,  however,  consists  of  a  patting  down  of  the  outside  of  the
clothing and does not justify reaching into pockets unless the patdown
has  revealed  something  that  feels  like  a  weapon.  Since  there  is  no
indication that the bag of marijuana felt like a weapon, C is incorrect.
D  is  incorrect  because  although  a  warrant  to  search  premises  might
authorize a search of persons present, it does not justify their arrest
unless there is probable cause to believe that they have committed or
are committing a felony.

4.  D  To  be  enforceable,  a  contract  requires  mutuality  of  assent.  If  both
parties are mistaken about a basic assumption of their agreement (i.e.,

1204

there  is  a  bilateral  mistake),  there  is  no  mutuality  of  assent  and  no
enforceable  agreement  can  be  formed.  Both  the  seller  and  the  buyer
believed  that  they  were  contracting  for  the  purchase  and  sale  of  one
parcel of realty, when in fact the written contract identified a different
parcel of realty. Their bilateral mistake thus prevented the mutuality of
assent necessary to make their “contract” enforceable.

If  the  mistake  had  been  the  seller's  alone  (i.e.,  unilateral),  it  would
not have prevented the formation of a contract unless the buyer knew
or  should  have  known  about  it.  For  this  reason,  if  the  buyer  had
known that the parcel described in the writing (#341) had a building
on  it,  while  the  parcel  that  he  had  inspected  (#241)  did  not,  the
seller's mistake would have prevented the formation of a contract. A
is incorrect, however, because the buyer did not know this at the time
the  writing  was  signed.  If  the  only  mistake  in  the  formation  of  a
contract is made by an intermediary chosen by one of the parties, that
mistake is charged to the party who selected the intermediary. (If, for
example, the attorney had said, “My client wants to buy #341,” and
the seller and the buyer had agreed on a price for #341, then the buyer
would  have  been  obligated  to  buy  #341  because  his  unilateral
mistake would not have prevented the formation of a contract.) In this
case,  however,  the  error  was  bilateral  —  both  the  seller  and  the
buyer  believed  that  they  were  contracting  for  the  purchase  of  a
different parcel. For this reason, B is incorrect. C is incorrect for two
reasons: First, if the seller's mistake had been unilateral, the fact that
she would suffer a substantial loss as a result would not be enough to
free  her  of  obligations  under  the  contract,  and  second,  the  bilateral
mistake  regarding  a  basic  assumption  of  the  contract  prevented  the
formation of an enforceable contract for the sale of #341 whether it
was more valuable than #241 or not.

5.  D  The  First  Amendment  prohibits  laws  that  interfere  with  the  free
exercise  of  religion.  A  law  that  makes  a  benefit  available  to  some
people  but  denies  it  to  others  because  of  their  religious  affiliations
may violate this provision because it imposes a burden on the exercise
of  a  religious  belief.  In  1978,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court
specifically  held  (McDaniel  v.  Paty,  435  U.S.  618  (1978))  that  a
statute  that  prohibited  members  of  the  clergy  from  running  for  public
office  was  invalid  for  this  reason.  Even  without  this  decision,
however, the argument set forth in D is the only one listed that could
possibly support the plaintiff's position.

1205

Although a state may not set qualifications for state office that violate
rights  protected  by  the  United  States  Constitution,  there  is  no
constitutional  requirement  that  qualifications  for  state  office  be
consistent  with  qualifications  for  federal  office.  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  statute  in  question  does  not
attempt to set qualifications for practicing members of the clergy. C is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  although  the  creation  of  political
divisiveness along religious lines may make a law invalid under the
Establishment  Clause,  this  is  not  relevant  to  rights  protected  by  the
Free Exercise Clause, and second, prohibiting members of the clergy
from holding public office is not likely to have that effect.

6. A If the long-arm statute of the state in which the federal district court sits
permits a certain type of service against an out-of-state defendant, the
federal district court will permit that type of service as well. See Fed.
R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1).

Therefore, B, C, and D are incorrect.

7.  C  The  privilege  of  self-defense  excuses  a  defendant  from  criminal
liability when he or she is using reasonable force to protect himself or
herself  against  the  commission  of  a  crime.  One  is  never  justified  in
using  deadly  force  in  self-defense,  however,  unless  he  or  she
reasonably  believes  that  he  or  she  is  in  imminent  danger  of  death  or
great  bodily  injury.  The  defendant  was  not  justified  in  slapping  the
victim's  face;  however,  if  the  victim  exceeded  his  privilege  of  self-
defense when he began loading his pistol in apparent retaliation, this
made him the aggressor. If the defendant then had a reasonable (even
though mistaken) belief that his life was in danger, he was justified in
using deadly force to defend himself.

During the course of a fight, the role of aggressor may shift from one
person  to  the  other.  Although  a  person  is  not  privileged  to  defend
himself or herself against a privileged (i.e., reasonable) response to
his or her own aggression, he or she is privileged to defend himself
or herself against an unprivileged attack. Although the defendant was
the  initial  aggressor,  he  may  have  been  privileged  to  use  force  to
defend himself against the victim's response to the slap if the victim's
response was excessive (i.e., unprivileged). A is therefore incorrect.
What force is reasonable in self-defense depends not so much on the
facts as upon the way the facts were perceived by the defendant and
how they would have been perceived by the reasonable person in the

1206

defendant's  position.  Thus,  even  in  jurisdictions  that  require  a
defendant to make reasonable attempts to escape before using lethal
force in self-defense, the fact that the defendant could have escaped
would  not  be  relevant  unless  the  reasonable  person  in  his  shoes
would  have  realized  that.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because  a  determination  of  what  force  is  reasonable  in  self-defense
depends  on  the  state  of  mind  of  the  defendant,  not  on  that  of  the
victim.

8.  A  Under  the  collateral  source  rule,  sums  that  a  plaintiff  receives  from
anyone  other  than  a  tortfeasor  or  a  tortfeasor's  representative  are  not
relevant in determining the amount of damages to which the plaintiff is
entitled.  This  is  because  a  benefit  that  is  given  to  an  injured  person
should not be used to the advantage of the person who injured him or
her. Since the insurance company paid under a policy that the plaintiff
had purchased, the defendant should not derive a benefit from it by the
reduction of damages that he is required to pay.

If  a  plaintiff  has  received  payment  from  a  tortfeasor  (e.g.,  in
settlement),  the  amount  of  such  payment  may  be  deducted  from  the
plaintiff's  damage  to  reduce  the  liability  of  other  tortfeasors.  B  is
incorrect  since  this  is  true  whether  or  not  such  payment  was  made
pursuant  to  a  judicial  determination.  C  is  incorrect  under  the
collateral source rule for the reasons stated above. Ordinarily, when
one joint tortfeasor pays more than his or her fair share of a judgment,
he or she is entitled to recover part of it from other joint tortfeasors.
Some  jurisdictions  base  this  recovery  on  equal  apportionment,
referring  to  it  as  “contribution”  between  joint  tortfeasors.  Other
jurisdictions  base  this  recovery  on  the  relative  fault  of  the  joint
tortfeasors, referring to it as “partial indemnity.” Since the insurance
company was not a joint tortfeasor with the defendant, use of the term
partial indemnity is not applicable. D is therefore incorrect.

9. B Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  it  was  supported  by
consideration. Consideration is something of value given in exchange
for the promise. Since the defendant gave nothing of value in return for
the plaintiff's agreement to release her, his agreement was unsupported
by  consideration  and  is  therefore  unenforceable.  A  novation  is  an
agreement  to  substitute  the  performance  of  a  third  party  for  that  of  a
promisor coupled with the promisee's express agreement to release the
original  promisor  from  further  obligation.  In  a  novation,  the  third

1207

party's  promise  to  perform  for  the  promisee  is  consideration  for  the
promisee's agreement to release the original promisor. (For example,
X and Y have a contract requiring Y to perform. X, Y, and Z then agree
that  Z  will  perform  instead  of  Y,  and  Y  is  released  from  further
obligation. Z's promise to perform is consideration for X's agreement
to release Y.) A court could find that there was no novation in this case
because  the  daughter's  promise  to  perform  had  already  been  made,
and, therefore, it was not given in return for (i.e., as consideration for)
the plaintiff's agreement to release the defendant. While it is not certain
that a court would come to this conclusion, the argument given in B is
the only one listed that might be effective in response to the defendant's
claim.

The  parol  evidence  rule  prohibits  evidence  of  a  prior  or
contemporaneous oral agreement to contradict or modify the terms of
certain  writings.  Since  the  plaintiff's  oral  agreement  to  release  the
defendant was made after  their  written  contract,  the  parol  evidence
rule  does  not  apply  to  it.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  original
contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was for a three-year
period (i.e., could not be performed within a year). For that reason,
the Statute of Frauds required it to be in writing. Since the plaintiff's
agreement  to  release  the  defendant  had  instant  effect,  however,  the
Statute  of  Frauds  does  not  apply  to  it.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.
Accord  occurs  when  contracting  parties  agree  to  substitute  a  new
obligation  for  an  existing  one;  satisfaction  occurs  when  that  new
obligation  is  fulfilled.  Since  the  defendant's  delegation  to  her
daughter did not create any new obligation between the plaintiff and
the  defendant,  it  was  not  an  accord;  thus,  there  could  have  been  no
satisfaction. D is therefore incorrect.

10. A Issue preclusion (also known as collateral estoppel) bars a party from
re-litigating  issues  that  were  actually  litigated  and  necessary  for  the
judgment  in  the  first  action.  Here,  the  doctor's  potential  negligence
was  litigated  in  the  first  case  and  it  was  necessary  to  the  decision
because State A rules stated that any negligence on the doctor's part
would  bar  him  from  recovery.  Since  the  court  found  in  favor  of  the
doctor,  it  necessarily  found  that  the  doctor  was  not  negligent  in  any
way.

B  is  incorrect  because  a  subsequent  action  may  not  necessarily  be
barred even if it arose from the same transaction or occurrence. C is

1208

incorrect because, although the action did not have to be brought as a
compulsory counterclaim, the truck driver could still be collaterally
estopped from forcing the doctor to re-litigate the negligence issue. D
is incorrect because the fact the truck driver is bringing his action in
the same state court would not allow the truck driver to re-litigate the
negligence issue.

11.  B  Freedom  of  association  is  a  corollary  of  the  First  Amendment
freedoms  of  expression  and  assembly.  For  this  reason,  it  has  been
held  that  neither  the  federal  nor  the  state  government  can  impose  a
disability  on  a  person  as  a  result  of  membership  in  an  organization
unless the organization advocates illegal conduct and the person is an
active member who knows the organization's unlawful purposes and
specifically intends to further them. Since the law in question would
impose a disability (i.e., ineligibility for federal employment) solely
because  of  membership  in  an  organization,  without  regard  to
knowledge of the organization's purposes or the intent to further those
purposes, it is unconstitutional.

An ex post facto  law  is  one  that  imposes  a  criminal  penalty  on  the
basis  of  something  that  occurred  before  the  law  was  passed.  Since
the law in question does not impose a criminal penalty, it is not an ex
post  facto  law.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Whether  government
employment is a privilege or a right, ineligibility for it is a disability.
Since  the  disability  cannot  be  constitutionally  imposed  for  mere
membership in an organization, C is incorrect. D may be incorrect for
several  reasons,  but  at  least  because  the  law  does  not  take  into
account the views held by the persons to which it applies.

12. C The  federal  government  is  immune  from  taxation  by  the  states.  It  is
generally  understood,  however,  that  this  immunity  does  not  shield
private  parties  from  state  tax  liability,  even  though  they  have  a
contractual  relationship  with  the  federal  government.  Although
Congress has the power to specifically exempt a particular contractor
from  state  sales  tax  liability,  there  is  no  fact  here  indicating  that
Congress exercised that power.

A  state  attempt  to  regulate  interstate  commerce  may  violate  the
Commerce  Clause  of  the  United  States  Constitution.  A  is  incorrect,
however,  because  a  sales  tax  imposed  on  the  purchase  of  materials
used  to  build  a  bridge  does  not  regulate  interstate  commerce,  even
though  interstate  vehicles  may  eventually  use  the  bridge.  While  the

1209

state  lacks  power  to  tax  the  federal  government,  B  is  incorrect
because so long as it does not discriminate against them, the state is
free to tax persons doing business with the federal government. This
has  been  held  to  be  so  even  though  the  cost  of  such  taxes  may
eventually  be  passed  along  to  the  federal  government  via  cost-plus-
fixed-profit contracts. D is therefore incorrect.

13. A A person seeking to protect a legitimate interest is privileged to make
defamatory  statements  that  he  or  she  reasonably  believes  to  be  true,
under circumstances where the publication is reasonable in its scope.
Clearly, a doctor has a legitimate interest in attempting to prevent the
hiring  of  incompetent  nurses  by  a  hospital.  Since  the  defendant's
response  to  the  personnel  department  questionnaire  was  likely  to
reach only those people who could decide whether or not to hire the
plaintiff,  it  was  probably  reasonable  in  scope.  Also,  because  the
other  doctor  was  a  well-respected  trainer  and  mentor  of  nurses,  it
was likely reasonable to believe his statements regarding the nurse's
competence.  Therefore,  because  the  defendant  reasonably  believed
the statement, it was privileged, and the defendant would not be liable
for defamation.

The publication of a false defamatory statement — unless privileged
— ordinarily results in liability, even though the publisher heard the
statement from another and so indicates when making the statement. B
is  therefore  incorrect.  The  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  has
held  that  a  plaintiff  who  is  a  public  person  may  prevail  in  a
defamation  action  only  by  proving  that  the  defendant  had  “actual
malice.” C is incorrect, however, because the Court has stated that, in
a defamation action, “actual malice” means that when publishing the
statement,  the  defendant  either  knew  that  it  was  false  or  entertained
serious  doubts  about  its  truth.  C  is  also  incorrect  because  actual
malice alone is not sufficient to result in defamation liability. In some
defamation  actions,  the  plaintiff  must  prove  that  the  defendant's
publication  resulted  in  actual  damage  to  the  plaintiff.  Proof  of
damage,  however,  is  not  sufficient  to  result  in  defamation  liability
where other elements of the plaintiff's case have not been established
or where the defendant was privileged. D is therefore incorrect.

14. D A positive statement by the promisor to the promisee indicating that
the  promisor  will  not  perform  his  or  her  contractual  duty  is  a
repudiation of the contract. Even though performance was not yet due

1210

at the time of repudiation, the non-repudiating party may usually sue
on a theory of anticipatory breach as soon as the repudiation occurs.
Therefore, the seller acquired an immediate right of action as soon as
the buyer communicated that he would not order any boxes in 2012.

A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect for two reasons: First, UCC
the  validity  of  “requirements”
§2-306  specifically  recognizes 
contracts  and  specifies  the  manner  in  which  their  terms  should  be
construed,  and  second,  damages  for  failing  to  order  the  specified
minimum  requirement  could  be  fixed  with  certainty.  A  party  who
seeks  damages  for  breach  of  contract  is  required  to  prove  those
damages;  they  are  not  presumed.  C  is  incorrect  for  this  reason,  and
because — strictly speaking — a repudiation is not a “breach,” but
an “anticipatory breach.”

15. A To prevail in an action for defamation, a plaintiff must prove that the
defendant  published  a  defamatory  statement  about  the  plaintiff.  A
defamatory  statement  is  about  the  plaintiff  if  the  reasonable  person
who  knows  the  plaintiff  would  recognize  the  plaintiff  from  the
statement. For this reason, a defamatory statement made about a group
to  which  the  plaintiff  belongs  identifies  the  plaintiff  so  long  as  the
group is small enough to lead the reasonable person who knows that
the plaintiff is a member of the group to believe that 
the statement about the group is being made about the plaintiff.

The  issue  here  is  what  was  said  in  the  newspaper,  not  whether  the
police  officers  were  engaged  in  their  official  duties  or  not.  This
makes B incorrect. A spoken defamation is called “slander per se” if
it  accuses  the  plaintiff  of  a  crime  of  moral  turpitude,  of  having  a
loathsome disease, of being an unchaste woman, or of being unfit for
the  plaintiff's  occupation.  In  certain  cases  of  slander  per  se,  the
plaintiff  may  be  relieved  of  the  need  to  prove  actual  damage.  C  is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  statement  cannot  be  called
slander  because  it  was  in  writing,  and  second,  calling  a  statement
slander per se does not eliminate the need to prove that the statement
was made about the plaintiff. If the group of police officers present at
the  rally  was  small  enough,  the  statement  about  the  group  identifies
the plaintiffs (for reasons given above) even though it does not name
them. D is therefore incorrect.

16. C If questioning during voir dire reveals a juror is biased, the juror may
be excused for cause. A juror has an actual bias if the juror indicates

1211

he or she would use predetermined beliefs or principles instead of the
facts  presented  to  determine  a  case.  Since  the  woman  stated  she
would have a hard time keeping an open mind because she believed
the  police  habitually  discriminated  against  minorities,  she  can  be
excused for cause.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  question  specifically  asks  about  her
statements. There is no indication any of the attorneys want the juror
dismissed based on her race. B is incorrect because although she said
she had no strong feelings or private knowledge, she did indicate she
had  an  actual  bias  regarding  the  issue  presented  by  the  case.  D  is
incorrect because an implied bias refers to the situation where a juror
states  he  or  she  is  not  biased,  but  an  average  person  in  that  juror's
position would likely be partial to one of the parties (for example, if
one of the parties was related to the juror). Here, the woman stated an
actual bias.

17.  A  Under  FRE  804(b)(2),  a  statement  is  admissible  as  a  dying
declaration if it was made about the cause and circumstances of death
by a presently unavailable declarant with a sense of impending death,
was based upon the declarant's personal knowledge, and is offered at
the  trial  of  a  criminal  homicide  prosecution  or  of  any  civil  action.
Since the plaintiff asked the witness to tell his wife to meet him at the
hospital, it is possible that a court would find that he did not believe
himself to be dying. This conclusion is, of course, not certain (since
he may have been telling her where to claim his body), but A is the
only reason listed that could possibly justify finding that the plaintiff's
statement was not a dying declaration.

B  is  incorrect  because  while  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  (FRE)
require  the  declarant  to  be  unavailable,  it  does  not  require  that  he
have died from the incident described in his statement, or even that he
is  dead.  Although  some  controversy  exists  at  common  law  about
whether a dying declaration is admissible in anything but a criminal
homicide  prosecution,  the  FRE  specifically  permit  its  use  in  a  civil
action.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  common  law  provides  that  an
excited  utterance  may  be  admissible  under  an  exception  to  the
hearsay  rule,  but  only  if  the  statement  was  spontaneous  (e.g.,  not  in
response  to  a  question).  The  FRE  exception  for  excited  utterance
does  not  specifically  mention  spontaneity,  but  some  cases  indicate
that excited utterances should be excluded under the FRE if they were

1212

made  in  response  to  a  question.  D  is  incorrect,  however,  because
neither the common law nor the FRE require that a dying declaration
be made spontaneously.

18. D Under FRE 703, “[i]f experts in the particular field would reasonably
rely  on  those  kinds  of  facts  or  data  in  forming  an  opinion  on  the
subject, they need not be admissible for the opinion to be admitted.”
Consequently,  if  other  experts  in  the  field  would  rely  on  the
maintenance  worker's  statement,  the  expert  may  do  so  even  if  it  is
inadmissible. Therefore, A is incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  the  expert  did  not  interview  the
maintenance  worker  herself  does  not  change  the  analysis.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  expert's  use  of  the  statement  in  her  testimony
does not change the inadmissible statement to an admissible one.

19.  A  Although  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  interprets  the  federal
constitution, it does not have the power to interpret state constitutions.
Therefore, if it reviewed the decision of the state court, it could not
disturb  the  holding  that  the  due  process  requirement  of  the  state
constitution  was  violated.  Since  that  holding  alone  is  sufficient  to
support  the  state  court's  finding  on  behalf  of  the  plaintiff  (i.e.,  the
finding  is  based  on  an  adequate  and  independent  state  ground),  the
United  States  Supreme  Court  lacks  the  power  to  overturn  the  state
court decision. For this reason, review by the United States Supreme
Court is not available. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

20. D Under FRE 803(22), a judgment of conviction may be admissible as
an exception to the hearsay rule. For any evidence to be admissible,
however,  it  must  be  logically  and  legally  relevant.  Whether  a  past
conviction for passing bad checks is logically related to any material
issues  in  the  defendant's  prosecution  is  uncertain,  but  there  is  little
doubt  about  the  legal  relevancy  of  such  evidence.  Because  of  its
capacity  for  arousing  prejudice,  evidence  bearing  on  a  person's
character is not admissible as circumstantial evidence that his or her
conduct  on  a  particular  occasion  was  consistent  with  that  character.
Thus,  the  defendant's  conviction  for  passing  worthless  checks  is
inadmissible if offered to support an inference that because he passed
bad  checks  that  time,  it  is  likely  that  he  did  it  again  this  time.  If  the
crime  charged  had  been  committed  in  a  highly  distinctive  way,
evidence  that  the  defendant  previously  used  that  same  distinctive
modus operandus (MO) would tend to establish that he was familiar

1213

with  it.  It  could  be  admissible  since  its  purpose  would  not  be  to
circumstantially  establish  conduct  by  showing  character.  A  is
incorrect, however, because there is no fact indicating that the crime
with which the defendant is now charged and the crime of which he
was  previously  convicted  involved  the  same  distinctive  MO.  Since
the  fact  that  a  person  has  committed  a  crime  involving  dishonesty
suggests that his or her statements are not worthy of belief, evidence
that a witness has been convicted of such a crime may be admissible
for  the  purpose  of  impeaching  that  witness's  credibility.  Since  the
defendant has not testified, however, his credibility is not in question.
B is therefore incorrect.

the  Rule  Against  Perpetuities  and 

21. A A fee simple subject to an executory limitation allows for an estate to
pass to a third person upon the happening of a stated event. The third
person who may gain the estate holds an executory interest. However,
the  issue  here  is  that  executory  interests  are  subject  to  the  Rule
Against  Perpetuities.  The  Rule  Against  Perpetuities  states  “No
interest  is  good  unless  it  must  vest,  if  at  all,  not  later  than  21  years
after some life in being at the creation of the interest.” Here, since the
friend's interest might not vest until more than 21 years after all lives
in being at the time the landowner conveyed the interest, the executory
interest  violates 
is  void.
Consequently, the county is simply left with a fee simple absolute. B
is  incorrect  because  of  the  executory  interest's  violation  of  the  Rule
Against  Perpetuities.  C  is  incorrect  because,  although  a  fee  simple
subject  to  a  condition  subsequent  also  takes  into  account  the
happening of a certain event, it does not automatically end when the
event occurs. In addition, it is the grantor, not a third party, who has
the  right  to  take  back  the  property.  Phrases  that  create  a  fee  simple
subject  to  a  condition  subsequent  use  words  such  as  “upon  express
condition  that”  or  “provided  that.”  D  is  incorrect  because  a  fee
simple determinable is created by using phrases such as “so long as”
or “until.” Importantly, the grantor is left with a possibility of reverter
if the stated event occurs.

22. D Title passes immediately from the grantor to the grantee once a deed
is  validly  executed  and  delivered.  Consequently,  returning  or
destroying the deed has no effect on the conveyance. If the landowner
wanted  to  get  the  land  back,  he  should  have  required  his  son  to
execute  and  deliver  a  new  deed  to  him.  Therefore,  A  and  B  are
incorrect.

1214

C  is  incorrect  because  whether  or  not  the  son  made  a  photocopy
wouldn't change the analysis.

23.  D  A  professional  seller  who  supplies  a  defective  product  is  strictly
liable for damage that proximately results from the product's defect. A
defect is a proximate cause of harm if it was both a factual and a legal
cause of it. A defect is a factual cause of harm if the harm would not
have occurred without it. Assuming that the vibrations resulted from a
defect, the defect was a factual cause of the neighbor's injury since the
injury would not have occurred without it. A defect is a legal cause of
harm if the harm was a foreseeable result of the defect, not the result
of unforeseeable interventions (i.e., superseding causes). Thus, if the
intervening  conduct  of  the  woman  was  a  superseding  cause  of  the
harm, then the product defect — although a factual cause of the injury
—  was  not  a  legal  cause  of  it.  Although  it  might  take  a  jury  to
determine  whether  the  woman's  conduct  was  unforeseeable  (i.e.,  a
superseding cause), D is the only argument listed that might result in a
judgment for the store.

If all other requirements are satisfied, strict liability may be imposed
to  benefit  any  plaintiff  whose  contact  with  the  product  was
foreseeable,  regardless  of  whether  the  plaintiff  is  classified  as  a
bystander.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  plaintiff  who  voluntarily
encounters a known risk assumes that risk. B  is  incorrect,  however,
because the woman was not the plaintiff, and only a plaintiff is said
to assume a risk. If the processing machine was defective when it left
the  company's  factory,  the  company  might  be  strictly  liable  for  the
neighbor's injuries that proximately resulted. C is incorrect, however,
because  if  the  product  was  defective  when  it  left  the  company's
factory, it must have been defective when it left the store's premises,
making the store strictly liable as well.

24. D A statutory system of classification that regulates social or economic
interests is valid under the Equal Protection Clause if it has a rational
basis. On the other hand, if it discriminates against a suspect class of
persons, it is valid only if it is necessary to serve a compelling state
interest. (Note: To withstand a constitutional challenge based on the
claim that a statute interferes with a fundamental right, the statute must
be necessary to serve a compelling state interest. Since the plaintiff's
challenge  is  not  based  on  that  claim,  however,  the  compelling  state
interest  standard  does  not  apply.)  Although  it  has  been  held  that  a

1215

statutory classification based on gender does not discriminate against
a  suspect  class,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  developed  a
third,  or  middle,  level  of  scrutiny  (sometimes  called  “rational  basis
with  a  bite”)  for  such  classifications.  It  has  been  held  that  gender
classifications  are  valid  only  if  they  are  substantially  related  to  an
important governmental interest. Since the plaintiff's sole claim is that
the statute discriminates against women, the statute would be valid if
it satisfied this middle level of scrutiny. Although it is not certain that
the statute would satisfy the requirements of this test, the argument set
forth  in  D  is  the  only  one  listed  that  might  possibly  be  effective  in
opposition to the plaintiff's claim.

A is incorrect because the fact that a system of classification does or
does not discriminate against a suspect class determines the standard
to  be  applied,  but  it  does  not  itself  determine  whether  the  statute  is
constitutional. B is incorrect because a rational basis is not sufficient
to  make  constitutional  a  statute  that  discriminates  on  the  basis  of
gender. C is incorrect because police powers, like all other powers
of  the  state,  may  not  be  exercised  in  a  way  that  is  inconsistent  with
the United States Constitution.

25. C The terms of a contract may provide that a party's performance is not
required  until  the  happening  of  a  specified  event  (i.e.,  a  condition
precedent). If so, the duty to perform does not become absolute until
that  event  has  occurred  (i.e.,  the  condition  precedent  has  been
satisfied). In this contract, the defendant's duty to make final payment
was  conditioned  upon  the  plaintiff's  obtaining  a  Certificate  of
Satisfactory Completion from the architect prior to July 30. Thus, the
defendant's duty to pay would not become absolute until the plaintiff
satisfied  the  condition  precedent  by  obtaining  the  certificate  by  that
date. It is understood, however, that a party who wrongfully interferes
with  the  other  party's  fulfillment  of  a  condition  may  not  rely  on  that
unfulfilled condition to avoid performing. Sometimes this conclusion
is based on what is referred to as a breach of the “implied promise to
cooperate.”  Sometimes  courts  simply  say  that  wrongful  interference
excuses performance of the condition precedent. Either way, since the
defendant's  request  caused  the  architect  to  delay  issuing  the
certificate,  the  defendant's  duty  to  make  final  payment  may  become
absolute in spite of the plaintiff's failure to fulfill that condition of the
contract.

1216

A  is  incorrect  because  the  architect  was  not  a  party  to  the  contract
between  the  defendant  and  the  plaintiff,  and  that  contract  therefore
could not have imposed duties on the architect. It is sometimes said
that express conditions of a contract must be fully satisfied, but that
“substantial performance” satisfies constructive conditions. Since the
condition requiring the plaintiff to obtain a Certificate of Satisfactory
Completion  by  July  30  was  express,  substantial  performance  would
not  have  been  sufficient.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Sometimes  in  a
contract calling for performance to the satisfaction of the other party,
a dispute arises as to whether that satisfaction is to be subjective or
based  on  objective  standards.  Usually,  in  the  absence  of  a  clear
agreement  to  the  contrary,  the  standard  is  understood  to  be  an
objective one. In this case, however, the express condition required
not only satisfactory completion, but the obtaining of a certificate by a
particular  date.  For  this  reason,  the  application  of  an  objective
standard would not be sufficient to defeat the defendant's claim. D is
therefore incorrect.

26. A One who intentionally aids, abets, or facilitates the commission of a
crime is an accomplice and not only is guilty of the crime that he or
she  aided,  but  also  is  vicariously  liable  for  all  its  reasonably
foreseeable consequences. One who agrees with another to commit a
crime is guilty of conspiracy and is vicariously liable for any crimes
committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy. Since
the  jury  did  not  believe  the  defendant's  testimony,  the  friend  was
committing a robbery when he used a threat of force to steal the coat
from the victim. Since the defendant assisted him in doing so, she was
an accomplice. Since she agreed to do so, she was a co-conspirator.
As an accomplice, she is probably liable vicariously for the friend's
intentional killing of the victim because her knowledge that the friend
would be using a gun to coerce the victim into handing over the coat
probably made it foreseeable that he would shoot the victim with the
gun.  As  a  co-conspirator,  she  is  vicariously  liable  for  the  shooting
since  it  was  clearly  in  furtherance  of  the  robbery  that  she  agreed  to
commit.

B  is  incorrect  because  being  present  while  a  crime  is  committed  is
not sufficient to make a defendant an accomplice or a co-conspirator.
Self-defense is a privilege to use reasonable force to defend oneself
against the use of force. A person who is being shot at may, therefore,
be  privileged  to  defend  himself  or  herself  by  shooting  back.  C  is

1217

incorrect,  however,  because  self-defense  does  not  privilege  the  use
of  force  in  response  to  force  which  itself  was  privileged  by  self-
defense. Since the friend was menacing the victim with a pistol, the
victim  was  privileged  to  use  a  pistol  in  self-defense.  Since  the
victim's use of force was privileged, the friend was not privileged to
use  any  force  in  defense  against  it.  D  is  incorrect  because  as  a  co-
conspirator and accomplice to the crime of robbery, the defendant is
vicariously 
that  was  a  foreseeable
the  shooting 
consequence and done in furtherance of the robbery.

liable  for 

27. D Since the notary received his interest from the neighbor, the validity
of the notary's title depends on the validity of the neighbor's title. For
this reason, if the neighbor's title is superior to the friend's, then the
notary's title is superior to the friend's. The validity of the neighbor's
title  depends  on  the  recording  statute.  The  statute  given  is  a  typical
“notice”  statute.  According  to  its  provisions,  the  interest  of  a
subsequent grantee for value and without notice is superior to that of a
prior grantee unless the prior grantee's interest was recorded prior to
the time the subsequent grantee received his or her interest. Since the
friend's deed was not recorded prior to the landowner's conveyance
to  the  neighbor,  the  neighbor's  interest  is  superior  to  the  friend's.
Since the notary derives his interest from 
the  neighbor's  grant,  the  notary's  interest  is  also  superior  to  the
friend's.

As a result of this reasoning, it is correct to say that one who derives
his or her interest from a bona fide purchaser for value (i.e., BFP) is
protected by a recording statute even if he or she is not a BFP himself
or herself. Thus, the notary's possible knowledge would not deprive
him of the protection of the recording statute, and A is incorrect. B is
incorrect  because  it  fails  to  take  into  account  the  effect  of  the
recording  statute.  While  the  neighbor  did  purchase  for  value,  he
clearly  executed  a  deed  conveying  the  property  to  the  notary.  C  is
therefore incorrect.

28.  B  Under  the  common  law,  rape  consists  of  sexual  intercourse  with  a
female  not  the  wife  of  the  defendant  without  that  female's  consent.
Under  most  statutory  rape  laws,  a  female  below  a  given  age  is
determined to be incapable of consent, meaning that any male who has
sexual  intercourse  with  her  does  so  without  her  consent.  For  this
reason, knowledge of the victim's age is not ordinarily an element of

1218

statutory  rape.  Under  the  statute  given  in  this  question,  however,
knowledge  of  the  female's  age  is  specifically  required.  For  this
reason, the boy could not be convicted if he did not know that the girl
was under the age of 18 years.

So long as a male defendant is old enough to be convicted of a crime,
he may be convicted of statutory rape even though his age is the same
as or younger than that of the female victim. A is therefore incorrect.
Intoxication  is  a  defense  to  a  criminal  charge  only  if  it  made  the
defendant  incapable  of  possessing  the  necessary  state  of  mind
required. C is incorrect because there is no indication that the boy's
intoxication  affected  his  knowledge  regarding  the  girl's  age  or
prevented  him  from  knowing  that  he  was  having  sexual  intercourse
with  her.  Statutory  rape,  of  which  the  crime  charged  is  a  form,  is
based on the concept that certain persons are incapable of consenting
to  sexual  intercourse.  For  this  reason,  the  victim's  consent  never
furnishes a defense, and D is incorrect.

29. C If a plaintiff brings an action in state court that could have originally
been  brought  in  federal  court,  a  defendant  can  have  it  removed  to
federal court. See 28 U.S.C.§1441. Federal courts have subject matter
jurisdiction over claims where the plaintiff and defendant are citizens
of different states and the amount in controversy is over $75,000. The
man is claiming $100,000, so he meets the jurisdictional amount. He
is also a citizen of State A. A corporation is a citizen of the state it is
incorporated  in  and  a  citizen  of  the  state  where  it  has  its  principal
place of business. Courts determine “principal place of business” by
looking  at  where  the  corporation's  top  management  direct  the
corporation's business activities. Consequently, the moving company
is a citizen of State B based on incorporation, and a citizen of State C
based  on  its  principal  place  of  business.  Thus,  there  is  diversity  of
citizenship between the parties, and the moving company can remove
the  claim  to  federal  court  because  it  could  have  originally  been
brought there.

A is  incorrect  because  the  claim  can  still  be  removed  even  if  it  is
based on State A motor vehicle law. B is incorrect because although
the moving company did 70 percent of its business in State A, it is not
a  citizen  of  State  A.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  company's  belief
federal  subject  matter
regarding 
jurisdiction.

fairness  would  not  create 

1219

30.  C  Although  a  defendant's  violation  of  a  statute  may  help  the  plaintiff
establish  that  the  defendant  was  negligent,  that  negligence  does  not
result  in  liability  unless  it  was  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  the
plaintiff's  damage.  Conduct  is  a  factual  cause  of  harm  if  the  harm
would  not  have  occurred  without  it.  Since  obeying  the  speed  limit
was more likely to cause the collapse than exceeding it, the accident
would  have  occurred  if  the  statute  had  been  obeyed.  Since  the
collapse  would  have  occurred  without  it,  the  violation  was  not  a
factual cause of the collapse.

In some jurisdictions, the violation of a statute may be negligence per
se; in others, it may raise a rebuttable presumption of negligence; and
in  others,  it  may  merely  raise  an  inference  of  negligence.  A  is
incorrect,  however,  because  negligence  does  not  result  in  liability
unless it was a factual cause of harm, and the defendant's violation of
a statute — even if it establishes negligence — was not a cause of the
plaintiff's  harm.  Although  violation  of  a  statute  may  raise  a
presumption of negligence, it does not result in any presumption as to
causation  and  is  usually  not  relevant  to  issues  of  causation.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  Unless  the  statute  violated  was  designed  to
protect  a  class  of  persons  that  includes  the  plaintiff,  its  violation  is
not  relevant  to  the  question  of  negligence  at  all.  D  is  incorrect,
however,  because  it  is  generally  understood  that  traffic  laws  are  at
least designed to protect other users of the roads.

31. B Since the condition imposed by the landowner's deed prohibited non-
residential use, the buyer's grant of a license to fish does not violate it
if fishing is a residential use. Whether or not this is so is uncertain,
but B is the only argument listed that could possibly provide the buyer
with an effective defense.

Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good if it can vest
after a particular period of time. The creation of an interest that might
vest after the period is thus void under the Rule, but the Rule has no
effect on the termination of an existing interest. A is incorrect for this
reason and because the Rule Against Perpetuities is not applicable to
future interests of a grantor. The fee simple determinable and the fee
simple subject to a condition subsequent are possessory interests that
may  be  terminated  on  the  happening  of  a  specified  event.  The  most
important difference between them is that the fee simple determinable
terminates  automatically  on  the  happening  of  that  event,  and  the  fee

1220

simple  subject  to  a  condition  subsequent  does  not  terminate  without
some action being taken. The language of the landowner's deed makes
it difficult to determine which of those interests was conveyed to the
buyer, but the difference is insignificant to the buyer since his interest
is  subject  to  termination  in  either  event.  For  this  reason,  C  is
incorrect.  A  restraint  on  alienation  is  a  condition  that  attempts  to
control the alienability (i.e., power to convey an interest) of realty. If
the condition attempts to do so directly (e.g., the condition prohibits
selling  or  mortgaging  the  realty),  it  may  be  declared  void  under
certain  circumstances.  Although  use  restrictions  are  likely  to  affect
the alienability of realty, policy does not require that they be declared
void  for  this  reason  alone  because  their  effect  is  indirect.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

32. D Ordinarily, specific performance is available as a remedy for breach
of  contract  when  damages  would  not  be  an  adequate  remedy.  For
several reasons, however, courts do not grant specific performance of
contracts  calling  for  personal  service.  These  reasons  include  the
involuntary  servitude  and  of
constitutional  protections  against 
freedom of association, as well as practical considerations that make
it unwise for courts to become unduly involved in the supervision of
performance.  Thus,  if  the  architectural  work  that  remained  to  be
completed  involved  personal  services,  specific  performance  would
not be granted.

A is therefore incorrect. An agreement not to assign usually destroys
the  right  but  not  the  power  to  make  an  effective  assignment.  This
means  that  an  assignment  made  in  the  face  of  such  an  agreement  is
usually  valid,  although  the  assignor  might  be  liable  for  damages
resulting  from  the  assignment  and  from  his  or  her  own  failure  to
perform.  For  this  reason,  damages  are  usually  the  only  remedy
available  for  breach  of  a  promise  not  to  assign.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. C is a misstatement of the above rule. While an agreement
not to assign may destroy the right to make a valid assignment (i.e.,
one who violates it may be liable for breach of contract), it does not
ordinarily  destroy  the  power  to  assign  (i.e.,  an  assignment  made  in
violation of the assignor's promise may be valid). For this reason, C
is  incorrect.  (Note:  The  obligation  to  perform  personal  services  is
not  usually  assignable  or  delegable.  This  rule  is  not  relevant  here,
however,  because  the  question  asks  not  about  the  validity  of  the
assignment,  but  about  the  availability  of  specific  performance  as  a

1221

remedy.)

33. A Under FRE 901(5) (and at common law), a voice may be identified by
any  person  who  testifies  that  he  or  she  recognizes  it  based  upon
hearing the voice under circumstances connecting it with the alleged
speaker. Although the plaintiff may not have known whose voice she
was  hearing  when  she  had  the  telephone  conversation,  if  she
subsequently  heard  the  defendant's  voice  and  recognized  it  as  the
same voice that she heard on the telephone, she is competent to testify
that it was the defendant's voice that she heard on the telephone. This
is true even though her first real opportunity to connect the defendant
with the voice occurred on the morning of trial.

If a person's telephone number is listed in the telephone book, there is
a presumption that one who properly dialed that number reached the
premises  of  the  person  listed.  Under  FRE  901(6),  this  presumption
combined  with  other  circumstances,  including  self-identification  of
the speaker as the person listed, may justify the admission of voice-
identification  testimony  by  a  witness  who  dialed  the  number.  Since
the plaintiff did not look up the defendant's number in the telephone
book  or  dial  it,  the  defendant's  self-identification  is  insufficient  to
make the plaintiff's testimony admissible. B is therefore incorrect. C
is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff's  subsequent  hearing  of  the
defendant's  voice  is  sufficient  to  make  her  voice-identification
testimony  admissible.  The  fact  that  the  plaintiff  had  not  dialed  the
defendant's number before speaking to him would prevent her voice-
identification testimony from being admissible under the special FRE
provision  discussed  above  regarding  telephone  identifications.  D  is
incorrect, however, because the fact that she recognized the telephone
voice  as  the  defendant's  after  hearing  the  defendant's  voice  in  the
judge's  chambers  is  sufficient  to  make  her  testimony  admissible
without that special provision.

34. D Since the Act prohibits the operation of munitions factories in which
airborne  levels  of  the  chemical  exceed  statutory  standards,  it  would
take a new law to permit the company's factory to operate in violation
of  those  standards.  In  effect,  by  giving  the  Senate  National  Defense
Committee the power to permit such operation, Section 34 purports to
give  it  the  power  to  make  a  law.  Article  I  of  the  United  States
Constitution provides that federal legislation must be passed by both
houses of Congress and then presented to the President for approval.
An  attempt  to  legislate  without  fulfilling  these  requirements  violates

1222

the Constitution.

The committee system in Congress exists, in part, because it enables
certain  questions  to  be  considered  by  bodies  that  have  had  an
opportunity  to  develop  expertise  in  certain  areas.  The  principle  of
bicameralism  established  by  Article  I  prevents  those  committees
from  legislating,  however.  For  this  reason,  A  is  incorrect.  Although
Congress may supervise the activities of administrative agencies that
it has created, the scope of such supervision is, of course, limited by
the provisions of the Constitution. As indicated above, the system of
supervision created by Section 34 exceeds constitutional limitations
because it purports to give a Senate committee the power to legislate.
B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,
Congress  may  authorize  an  administrative  body  to  impose  quasi-
criminal sanctions (although not to create them), and second, Section
34  does  not  give  an  administrative  agency  the  power  to  impose
sanctions but purports to limit that power.

35. B Extortion  consists  of  obtaining  property  from  another  by  threatening
future  harm  to  persons,  property,  or  economic  interests.  Since  the
defendant obtained money from the victim by threatening to blow up
her real and personal property, he can be convicted of extortion.

Robbery  consists  of  obtaining  property  from  another  by  using  or
threatening force against a person. Since the defendant made no threat
of  harm  to  a  person,  A  is  incorrect.  Larceny  by  trick  is  a  larceny
committed  by  making  a  misrepresentation  that  induces  the  victim  to
part with temporary possession of personal property. Since the victim
did  not  expect  her  cash  to  be  returned,  she  was  not  parting  with
temporary  possession  of  it,  and  C  is  incorrect.  Embezzlement  is  a
criminal conversion of personal property by one in lawful custody of
it.  Since  the  defendant  was  not  in  lawful  custody  of  the  victim's
money, D is incorrect.

36. B Article I, Section 10, provides in part that no state shall pass any law
impairing  the  obligation  of  contracts.  This  prevents  states  from
repudiating  their  own  contractual  obligations  or  interfering  with
private  contractual  obligations  except  by  regulations  that  are
reasonable  and  appropriate  to  a  significant  state  purpose.  Since  the
statute  in  question  does  not  result  in  a  repudiation  of  the  state's
contractual  obligations  or 
interfere  with  private  contractual
obligations, it does not violate the Obligation of Contracts Clause.

1223

it  discriminates  against 

The  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits  states  from  invidiously
discriminating.  Since  the  statute  requires  higher  fees  from  non-
residents, 
them.  Although  some  such
discrimination has been held to be valid, it is possible that this statute
is not. A  therefore  could  be  an  effective  argument  in  support  of  the
constitutional  challenge,  making  A  incorrect.  The  Privileges  and
Immunities  Clause  of  Article  IV  of  the  United  States  Constitution
provides  that  “The  citizens  of  each  state  shall  be  entitled  to  all
privileges and immunities of the citizens in the several states.” Since
this  has  been  held  to  prohibit  certain  discrimination  against  out-of-
staters,  C  also  could  be  an  effective  argument  in  support  of  the
constitutional  challenge  and  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  Commerce
Clause  prohibits  the  states  from  discriminating  against  or  imposing
undue burdens on interstate commerce. Violations have been found on
both  grounds  in  laws  that  denied  to  out-of-staters  advantages  that
were available to state residents. For this reason, D also could be an
effective argument and is therefore incorrect.

37.  B  An  assault  is  committed  by  intentionally  inducing  the  plaintiff's
reasonable apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact. It
has been held that a threatening act is not an assault if accompanied
by words that make clear that the threat will not be carried out, since
any  apprehension  experienced  by  the  plaintiff  would  not  be
reasonable. It is understood, however, that a defendant is not free to
avoid assault liability by demanding compliance with a condition that
he  or  she  has  no  legal  right  to  impose.  Since  the  defendant  had  no
legal  right  to  require  the  seller  to  back  out  of  his  contract  with  the
buyer, the fact that he told the seller that he could avoid the threatened
harm by doing so would not prevent the defendant from being liable
for assault. B is therefore not an effective argument in the defendant's
defense and is therefore correct.

Since  it  was  obvious  from  the  defendant's  statement  that  the
threatened  harm  would  not  occur  until  sometime  in  the  future,  A
would  be  an  effective  defense  and  is  therefore  incorrect.  Since  the
threat  was  of  harm  to  the  seller's  children  and  not  to  the  seller,  C
would be an effective defense and is therefore incorrect. Courts have
generally argued (although this argument is not always credible) that
apprehension  induced  by  the  defendant's  mere  use  of  words  is  not
reasonable. This has led to a rule that there can be no assault liability
unless the defendant has performed some physical act. D is therefore

1224

an effective defense and is therefore incorrect.

38.  C  Although  extrinsic  evidence  of  unconvicted  bad  acts  is  not  usually
admissible  for  the  purpose  of  proving  that  a  person  has  a  bad
character  or  was  inclined  to  commit  other  bad  acts,  such  evidence
may be admissible for other purposes. Proof that a fact is not as stated
by the defendant may be admissible for the purpose of impeachment
(i.e., to show that his or her testimony is not to be believed). If such
proof is extrinsic (i.e., not from the defendant's own mouth) it may be
used  to  impeach,  but  only  if  it  relates  to  a  material  issue  in  the
controversy.  Since  the  defendant  claimed  to  be  1,000  miles  away
from where the crime of arson was committed, his whereabouts on the
day  of  the  crime  are  of  consequence  (i.e.,  material)  in  the  arson
prosecution.  The  witness's  testimony  is  therefore  admissible  to
impeach  the  defendant.  In  general,  evidence  is  admissible  as
substantive proof if it is relevant to some fact of consequence in the
controversy.  Since  the  defendant's  whereabouts  on  the  day  of  the
crime  are  material  to  the  arson  prosecution,  the  witness's  testimony
— which tends to establish that the defendant was in the city on the
day of the fire — is admissible as substantive evidence.

39.  C  Since  a  will  speaks  upon  the  death  of  the  testator,  the  mailman's
interest  was  created  upon  the  death  of  the  landowner.  An  executory
interest  is  a  future  interest  in  a  grantee  that  will  become  possessory
only upon the termination of a prior estate, the termination of which is
not inevitable. Since, according to the devise, the friend's interest was
to terminate only if he died without issue from his wife, and since it
was not inevitable that this would happen, it was executory. Since the
mailman's interest was to replace that of the friend, it was a shifting
interest.

Consequently, A, B, and D are incorrect.

40. D If a claim is brought in federal court based on a question of federal
law, the federal court will also have jurisdiction over any state law
claims  arising  from  the  same  case  or  controversy.  See  Hurn  v.
Oursler,  289  U.S.  238  (1933).  Because  both  the  federal  law  claim
and the breach of contract claim arise from the woman's loss of her
job,  the  federal  court  would  have  jurisdiction  over  the  breach  of
contract  claim  even  if  it  is  based  on  state  law.  Therefore,  A  is
incorrect.

B  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  amount  in  the  controversy

1225

requirement for federal question jurisdiction. C is incorrect because
the  saleswoman  would  not  be  able  to  bring  a  claim  against  the
company if it did not arise from the same case or controversy.

41.  A  Under  FRE  609,  evidence  that  a  witness  has  been  convicted  of  a
crime is admissible for the purpose of attacking his or her credibility
under two distinct sets of circumstances. Such evidence is admissible
if the crime was a felony and the court determines that the probative
value outweighs the prejudicial effect to the defendant. Such evidence
is  also  admissible,  however,  if  the  crime  is  one  that  involved
dishonesty.  Since  tax  fraud  is  a  crime  involving  dishonesty,  the
evidence  is  admissible  whether  or  not  the  crime  was  a  felony,  and
without  an  affirmative  finding  that  its  probative  value  outweighs  its
prejudicial effect.

B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

42.  B  In  Wisconsin  v.  Yoder,  406  U.S.  205  (1972),  the  United  States
Supreme  Court  specifically  held  that  in  determining  whether  a
defendant's  conduct  is  privileged  by  First  Amendment  rights  to
freedom of religion, it was proper to consider whether the defendant's
religious beliefs were sincere.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Ordinarily,  a  state  may  prohibit  specified
activities  whenever  such  prohibition  serves  a  rational  basis.  Under
the  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment,  however,  a  state
may  not  interfere  with  acts  performed  in  the  exercise  of  religious
beliefs  unless  the  interference  bears  a  rational  relationship  to  a
compelling state interest. This means that there are some acts that the
state  may  validly  declare  to  be  criminal  and  prohibit  because  the
prohibition has a rational basis, but which may still be performed by
persons who are doing so in the exercise of their religious beliefs if
the prohibition does not bear a rational relationship to a compelling
state  interest.  Thus,  First  Amendment  rights  to  freedom  of  religion
might justify acts that would otherwise be criminal. For this reason,
C and D are both incorrect.

43. C The Equal Protection Clause provides that no state shall deny to any
person  within  its  jurisdiction  the  equal  protection  of  the  law.  This
means  that  any  state  agency  that  employs  a  system  of  classification
granting  rights  or  privileges  to  some  persons  while  denying  them  to
others  may  be  violating  rights  conferred  by  the  Equal  Protection
Clause.  Some  systems  of  classification  are  valid  if  they  have  a

1226

rational  basis;  other  systems  are  valid  only  if  they  are  necessary  to
serve a compelling state interest. It is uncertain whether the exclusion
of pregnant students from a public high school system is valid. Of the
fact situations given, however, C is the only one that could possibly
involve a violation of rights granted by the Equal Protection Clause.
This  is  because  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  regulates  only  state
action, and C is the only fact situation involving state action.

The  defendant  in  A  is  employed  by  a  religious  organization.  The
defendant  in  B  is  a  federal  official.  The  defendant  in  D  works  in
private enterprise. Since none of them is an agency of the state, A, B,
and D are incorrect.

is  defective  and  unreasonably  dangerous, 

44. A Strict  liability  is  imposed  on  the  professional  supplier  of  a  product
that 
that  defect
proximately causes harm to a plaintiff whose contact with the product
was foreseeable. If the reasonable person could not have anticipated
the  plaintiff's  contact  with  the  chemical  (i.e.,  the  plaintiff's  contact
with  it  was  unforeseeable),  strict  liability  cannot  be  imposed  to
benefit the plaintiff.

if 

If the plaintiff's harm was produced by an unforeseeable intervening
event,  the  product  defect  was  not  a  proximate  cause  of  it.  B  is
incorrect,  however,  because  intervening  negligence  may  be  (and
usually is) regarded as foreseeable. If the plaintiff's injury would not
have  occurred  but  for  the  crack  in  the  sewer,  the  crack  was  also  a
cause  of  harm.  The  existence  of  an  additional  cause  of  harm  is  not
sufficient  to  relieve  any  defendant  of  liability,  however,  unless  that
additional cause was unforeseeable. Since there is no indication that
the  crack  in  the  sewer  was  unforeseeable,  C  is  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  strict  products  liability  does  not  depend  on  the
existence  of  a  commercial  relationship  (i.e.,  privity)  between  the
defendant and any other person.

45. D Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c), if a party wants to amend a pleading to
change  the  party  against  whom  a  claim  is  asserted,  the  amendment
will relate back to the date of the original pleading if the claim arises
out  of  the  same  occurrence  as  the  original  pleading,  so  long  as  the
new party is served within 90 days after the complaint is filed (Fed.
R. Civ. P. 4(m)) and “(i) received such notice of the action that it will
not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and (ii) knew or should
have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for

1227

a  mistake  concerning  the  proper  party's  identity.”  The  owner  was
served on June 22, so it was within 90 days. Additionally, the man's
amended complaint arose from the same accident and the owner knew
that an action would be brought against him (based on his phone call
to the man). Therefore, B is incorrect.

A is incorrect because it states the wrong deadline for service. C is
incorrect because it is not enough that the claim arose from the same
occurrence. Importantly, the new party must have had some notice or
knew of the likelihood of being sued.

46. C An inter vivos conveyance of realty is not effective without delivery.
Delivery occurs when the grantor, by some words or act, manifests an
intent that the deed have a present operative effect. While the woman
indicated that she wanted to be sure that the husband had the property
after her death, she may have intended the quitclaim deed to transfer
an  interest  immediately.  If,  instead  of  handing  the  document  to  the
husband, she had locked it in a safe deposit box to which only she had
access,  it  would  be  clear  that  she  did  not  intend  an  immediate
transfer. On the other hand, if she simply handed it to the husband, it
would  be  clear  that  she  did  intend  an  immediate  transfer.  Here,
because  she  was  unable  to  leave  the  hospital,  she  could  not
personally place it in a safe deposit box. When she handed it to the
husband  with  the  request  that  he  put  it  in  the  box,  she  may  have
intended  to  “deliver”  it  to  him,  or,  without  intending  any  present
effect, she may have been asking him to lock it away for her since she
was  physically  unable  to  do  so  herself.  From  the  facts  given,  it  is
impossible to determine with certainty what her intention was. If the
safe  deposit  box  was  held  jointly  by  the  woman  and  the  husband,
however,  it  is  likely  that  she  intended  an  immediate  transfer,  since
putting the quitclaim deed in the box would place it in the husband's
immediate possession. C is correct since it is the only fact listed that
could possibly result in a judgment for the husband.

Since the formal requirements for wills are usually more demanding
than those for deeds, a deed that is intended to take effect only on the
death  of  a  grantor  (i.e.,  a  testamentary  substitute)  is  invalid.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  a  gift  causa  mortis  is
revoked  by  operation  of  law  if  the  donor  recovers  from  the  illness
that  threatened  his  or  her  life  at  the  time  the  gift  was  made.  D  is
requires  possession
adverse  possession 
incorrect  because 

1228

inconsistent  with  the  rights  of  the  owner,  and  the  husband's
possession of the land was at the woman's request.

47.  A  Under  the  best  evidence  rule  (aka  the  original  document  rule),
secondary  evidence  of  a  writing  is  not  admissible  to  prove  the
contents of the writing unless the original or a qualified duplicate is
shown to be unavailable. If the writing involved is in the hands of a
person  located  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court,  it  may  be
regarded as unavailable. This is not so, however, if the person who
has  it  is  the  party  offering  secondary  evidence.  Since  the  original
contract is in the hands of the plaintiff, it therefore cannot be regarded
as  unavailable.  Nevertheless,  the  copy  that  the  plaintiff  offers  in  A
will not be excluded under the best evidence rule, since the FRE treat
all photocopies as originals.

In B,  the  defendant  is  charged  with  forging  a  check.  This  obviously
places the contents of the check in issue. Since the check has not been
shown  to  be  unavailable,  the  best  evidence  rule  will  exclude  oral
testimony  as  to  its  contents.  Ordinarily,  an  expert  witness  may  base
his or her opinion on things that are not in evidence. In C, however,
the expert has based her opinion solely on her examination of the X-
ray. In effect, this means that all she is really doing is telling the court
what the X-ray says. By doing so, she placed the contents of the X-
ray  in  issue.  Under  the  best  evidence  rule,  her  testimony  is  thus
inadmissible unless the X-ray is produced or its absence explained. If
the writing in question is in the control of an adverse party who has
failed  to  produce  the  original  after  receiving  notice  to  do  so,  the
document may be regarded as unavailable. In D, however, there is no
indication  that  the  state  tax  collector  was  asked  to  produce  the
plaintiff's  original  tax  return  or  refused  to  do  so.  Until  the  plaintiff
establishes  this,  or  otherwise  establishes  that  the  tax  return  is
unavailable,  the  best  evidence  rule  will  prevent  the  admission  of
secondary evidence of its contents.

48. D Under 28 U.S.C. §1391, venue is proper in “(1) a judicial district in
which  any  defendant  resides,  if  all  defendants  are  residents  of  the
State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a
substantial  part  of  the  events  or  omissions  giving  rise  to  the  claim
occurred,  or  a  substantial  part  of  property  that  is  the  subject  of  the
action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may
be otherwise brought as provided in this section, any judicial district

1229

in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction
with  respect  to  such  action.”  Because  both  the  doctor  and  the  nurse
are  citizens  of  State  C,  either  of  the  districts  in  State  C  are  proper.
Additionally,  since  the  accident  occurred  in  the  Eastern  District  of
State B, that is also a proper venue.

Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.

49. B Embezzlement is criminal conversion of personal property known to
be  another's  with  intent  to  defraud,  committed  by  one  in  lawful
possession  of  that  property.  (Note:  Some  jurisdictions  require  that
there be a fiduciary relationship between victim and defendant. Since
the defendant's possession of the wallet resulted from her employment
relationship with the attorney, she may be found to have possessed it
as  his  fiduciary.)  When  the  defendant  spent  some  of  the  attorney's
money on ice cream, she converted it. Since she planned to keep the
money (i.e.,  use  it  as  her  own)  she  had  the  intent  to  defraud.  At  the
time,  she  was  in  lawful  possession  of  the  wallet.  Her  use  of  the
attorney's  money  for  the  purchase  of  ice  cream  was,  therefore,  an
embezzlement.  Once  a  crime  has  been  committed,  it  cannot  be
uncommitted. Thus, her returning the money to the attorney would not
prevent her from being convicted.

C is therefore incorrect. Larceny is a trespassory taking and carrying
off  of  personal  property  known  to  be  another's  with  the  intent  to
permanently deprive. A taking is trespassory if it violates the rights of
the  owner.  When  the  defendant  found  the  attorney's  wallet  in  the
parking lot and carried it off, she did not commit a trespassory taking
since her purpose prevented the taking from violating the rights of the
attorney.  For  this  reason,  and  because  she  then  lacked  the  intent  to
permanently  deprive  the  attorney,  she  did  not  commit  larceny  by
taking  the  wallet  home.  When  she  formed  the  intent  to  permanently
deprive  the  attorney,  and  when  she  acted  on  that  intent  by  spending
some of the money, the wallet was already in her possession, so she
did  not  “take”  or  carry  it  off.  For  this  reason,  she  did  not  commit
larceny. A and D are therefore incorrect.

50. C Private nuisance involves liability-forming conduct by the defendant
that unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy
his or her realty. A defendant's conduct may be liability-forming if it
involves  an  intentional  invasion  of  the  plaintiff's  rights.  A  defendant
“intends”  a  particular  result  if  he  or  she  acts  with  the  desire  or

1230

substantial  certainty  that  it  will  occur.  Here,  as  a  result  of  his
conversation  with  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant  knew  with  substantial
certainty  that  his  conduct  was  interfering  with  the  plaintiff's  use  and
enjoyment of his realty — and, therefore, by definition he intended the
interference.  Thus,  if  the  interference  was  an  unreasonable  one,  the
defendant  is  liable  for  nuisance.  Although  the  (un)reasonableness  of
the  invasion  depends  on  many  factors  not  given,  private  nuisance  is
the only theory listed that could possibly result in a judgment for the
plaintiff.

Trespass  to  land  requires  an  intentional  unauthorized  entry  onto  the
plaintiff's  realty  by  something  tangible.  Since  there  was  no  tangible
entry onto the plaintiff's land, A is incorrect. Intentional infliction of
emotional  distress  requires  outrageous  conduct  by  which  the
defendant  intentionally  inflicts  severe  mental  suffering  upon  the
plaintiff. B  is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff  does  not  seek  damages
for  mental  suffering  but  for  reduction  in  the  value  of  his  realty.
Although  an  invasion  of  privacy  may  be  committed  by  intentionally
and offensively interfering with the plaintiff's solitude, D is incorrect
because  this  theory  requires  some  physical  intrusion  into  the
plaintiff's presence.

51. B The  requirement  of  standing  exists  to  assure  that  a  person  making  a
constitutional  challenge  will  have  incentive  to  fully  and  vigorously
litigate  the  issues.  For  this  reason,  standing  requires  that  a  person
challenging  the  constitutionality  of  a  statute  show  some  actual  or
immediately threatened concrete personal injury that will be avoided
if the court grants the relief requested. Since the tax will reduce their
profits,  the  stockholders  of  a  corporation  with  sales  in  the  state  in
excess  of  $1  million  will  suffer  an  actual  injury  under  the  statute.
Since a finding that it violates the Commerce Clause would result in a
declaration that the statute is invalid and will therefore prevent the tax
from being collected, the injury will be avoided if the court grants the
relief  requested.  These  stockholders  therefore  have  standing  to
challenge the statute.

A is incorrect because there is no fact indicating that the people of the
neighboring  state  face  any  injury  under  the  statute,  and  additionally
because a state government does not have standing as a representative
of its residents. Since the corporation in C does not have annual gross
sales in excess of $1 million within the state, the statute imposes no

1231

tax on it. Thus, the corporation's stockholders lack standing because
they face no actual or immediately threatened injury under the statute.
C  is  therefore  incorrect.  Some  cases  have  held  that  state  taxpayers
have  standing  to  challenge  certain  expenditures  of  state  funds.  D  is
incorrect,  however,  because  this  statute  provides  for  acquisition
rather than expenditure of state funds.

its 

language  specifies  otherwise.  Since 

52.  A  A  transfer  of  realty  to  co-owners  is  presumed  to  convey  equal
interests  unless 
the
landowner's  will  made  the  niece  and  the  husband  joint  tenants  with
full right of survivorship as to a one-half interest, each is presumed to
have  received  an  equal  interest  in  the  one-half  interest,  or  a  one-
quarter interest in the whole. Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership
best  known  for  the  right  of  survivorship.  This  means  that  upon  the
death of a joint tenant, his or her interest passes to the surviving joint
tenant. Since a one-half interest was held by the niece and the husband
as  joint  tenants  with  full  right  of  survivorship,  the  death  of  either
spouse  would  cause  his  or  her  one-quarter  interest  in  the  realty  to
pass to the surviving spouse. Since neither spouse survived the other,
however, the interest of each passes to his or her heirs. A conveyance
to  co-owners  that  does  not  specify  the  form  of  co-ownership  is
presumed to create a tenancy in common. Since the landowner's will
did not specify the form of the daughter's co-ownership, it made her a
tenant in common with the niece and the husband. Co-owners do not
have a right to survive to the interest of a tenant in common. For this
reason, the daughter's one-half interest passes to her heirs.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  daughter's  tenancy  in  common  with  the
niece  and  the  husband  gave  her  no  right  to  their  interest.  C  is
incorrect because the landowner's will did not make the shares of the
co-owners  equal  but  specified  that  the  daughter  held  a  one-half
interest, and that the other one-half interest was held by the niece and
the  husband.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  landowner's  will  gave  the
daughter a one-half interest.

53. D The  covenant  of  quiet  enjoyment  is  a  promise  that  the  grantee  shall
peaceably  and  quietly  enjoy  possession  without  interference  by  the
grantor or anyone with a lawful claim. This covenant is breached only
when an actual eviction or other interference with possession occurs.
For this reason, it flows from the covenantor to the grantee and his or
her  successors.  Since  the  friend  interfered  with  the  baker's

1232

possession under a lawful claim of right, the warranty was breached.
Since  it  flowed  from  the  landowner  to  successors  of  the  artist,  the
landowner may be liable to the baker for damages resulting from the
breach.

The  covenant  of  seisin  is  a  promise  that  the  grantor  has  title  to  and
possession  of  the  realty.  The  covenant  against  encumbrances  is  a
promise  that  no  other  person  has  encumbrances  or  liens  against  the
realty. If the realty is not as covenanted, these covenants are breached
the  moment  a  deed  containing  them  is  delivered  to  a  grantee.  Since
the covenants are breached upon delivery of the deed, however, they
do  not  flow  to  successors  of  the  covenantor's  grantee.  Since  the
landowner did not have a right to possession (i.e., he had leased the
realty  to  a  friend),  and  since  the  friend  held  a  lien  on  the  realty
(resulting  from  the  lease),  these  covenants  were  breached  by  the
landowner when he conveyed the realty to the artist in March. Since
they do not flow to the artist's successors, however, the baker could
not  succeed  against  the  landowner  on  these  theories.  A  and  B  are
therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because a covenant of the right to
convey  does  not  include  a  promise  that  the  grantor  is  entitled  to
possession, and this covenant was not breached by the landowner at
any time.

54. D Negligence  is  the  breach  of  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  owed  to  the
plaintiff  by  the  defendant.  Ordinarily,  a  defendant  owes  a  plaintiff  a
duty  of  reasonable  care  if  the  defendant's  conduct  creates  a
foreseeable  risk  to  the  plaintiff.  Most  jurisdictions  limit  this  duty  if
the  plaintiff  is  a  trespasser  on  the  defendant's  land.  Since  the
plaintiff's  parents  had  paid  a  fee  for  her  to  stay  at  the  defendant's
camp, however, she was an invitee to whom a duty of reasonable care
was owed. Since the defendant set aside a particular area for use by
children  as  a  playing  field,  she  owed  the  children  who  used  it  (i.e.,
her  invitees)  the  duty  of  making  reasonable  inspections  and  taking
reasonable steps to protect the children against dangerous conditions.
Thus,  because  the  reasonable  person  would  have  discovered  and
removed the tree root, the defendant's failure to do so was negligent
(i.e., unreasonable).

Many  jurisdictions  have  held  that  a  landholder  is  not  obligated  to
protect  even  invitees  against  dangers  that  result  solely  from  natural
conditions of the land. Since the way softball is played and the nature
of children make it foreseeable that children using the field would run

1233

into the bushes, however, the defendant's designation of the field as a
playing field for children resulted in a risk greater than that created
by  nature  (i.e.,  the  tree  root's  existence).  Her  creation  of  this  risk
imposed  upon  her  a  duty  to  act  reasonably  to  protect  the  children
against it. A is therefore incorrect. A plaintiff assumes the risk when
he or she voluntarily encounters a danger of which he or she actually
(i.e., subjectively) knows. Since the pile of leaves covering the tree
root prevented the plaintiff from knowing about it, she did not assume
the  risk  by  encountering  it.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Some  writers
have said that an invitee is owed “the highest duty of care.” This is a
much-misunderstood  statement,  however.  All  it  really  means  is  that
the  duty  owed  to  invitees  is  generally  higher  than  that  owed  to
trespassers or licensees. Basically, it is a duty of reasonable care, not
an  absolute  duty  to  keep  invitees  safe.  It  simply  makes  landholders
liable if they fail to act reasonably. C is therefore incorrect.

55.  D  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration 
is  a  bargained-for  exchange  of
something of value for the promise. Because parties should be free to
strike whatever bargains appeal to them, courts do not usually inquire
into the relative values of the promise and the thing given in return for
it.  For  this  reason,  the  payment  of  $1  could  be  consideration  for  a
promise to hold open an offer to sell realty for $80,000. This is true,
however,  only  if  the  payment  of  $1  was  bargained-for  and  given  in
exchange for that promise. Since the seller did not ask for or receive
anything  in  exchange  for  her  promise,  it  was  unsupported  by
consideration  and  therefore  unenforceable.  In  a  few  jurisdictions,  a
recital like the seller's might be held to create a promise to pay $1,
and  that  promise  might  be  held  to  be  consideration  for  the  seller's
agreement  to  keep  the  offer  open.  D  is  correct,  however,  because  it
contains  the  only  reason  listed  that  could  possibly  support  the
conclusion that accompanies it.

The  parol  evidence  rule  prevents  the  use  of  extrinsic  evidence  of
prior  negotiations  or  agreements  to  modify  the  terms  of  an
unambiguous written contract that the parties intended as a complete
record  of  their  agreement.  Since  the  written  statement  that  she  had
received $1 was not a term of agreement but merely a recital of fact,
the parol evidence rule does not prevent the use of extrinsic evidence
to contradict it. A is therefore incorrect. When a promisee justifiably
relies  to  his  or  her  detriment  on  a  promise,  his  or  her  detrimental

1234

reliance may make the promise enforceable without consideration. B
is  incorrect,  however,  because  there  are  no  facts  indicating  that  the
buyer  changed  his  position  as  a  result  of  the  seller's  promise  (i.e.,
relied on the promise), the reasonable person would have relied on it
(i.e.,  that  reliance  was  justified),  or  the  buyer  was  damaged  (i.e.,
suffered detriment) as a result of such reliance. C is incorrect for two
reasons:  First,  courts  do  not  ordinarily  consider  whether
consideration  was  equal  in  value  to  a  promise  that  it  purports  to
support,  and  second,  the  dollar  was  not  consideration  for  the  realty
itself, but for an option to buy it.

56. C A party can only require another party to undergo a physical or mental
examination by obtaining a court order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 35(a). An
order to submit to a physical or mental examination may only be made
if the other party's physical condition is “in controversy” and there is
a showing of “good cause.”

Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

57. A Under FRE 803(2), a statement is admissible as an excited utterance
if it was made about a startling event while the declarant was under
the  stress  of  excitement  caused  by  that  event.  Since  being  pushed
down and injured is a startling event, and since the plaintiff's bleeding
and crying indicate that she was under the stress of excitement that it
produced, her statement qualifies as an excited utterance.

The  fact  that  a  declarant  is  presently  unavailable  is  never  in  itself
sufficient  to  permit  the  admission  of  his  or  her  out-of-court
statements.  B  is  incorrect  for  this  reason,  and  because  the  excited
utterance exception does not require that the declarant be unavailable.
C is incorrect, because although the plaintiff's statement is hearsay, it
is  admissible  under  the  excited  utterance  exception  to  the  hearsay
rule.  The  court  found  that  the  plaintiff  was  incompetent  to  testify
because  she  could  not  appreciate  her  duty  to  testify  truthfully.  The
reason that hearsay is customarily excluded is the fact that the hearsay
declarant was under no duty to speak truthfully when making the out-
of-court  statement.  The  excited  utterance  exception  to  the  hearsay
rule,  however,  is  based  on  the  inherent  trustworthiness  of  certain
statements made even while the declarant was under no legal duty to
tell the truth. For this reason, the plaintiff's inability to appreciate her
duty to tell the truth does not prevent her excited utterance from being
inherently trustworthy. D is therefore incorrect.

1235

58. A Leading questions are those that would give the ordinary person the
impression that the questioner desires one answer rather than another
and are ordinarily improper if asked on direct examination. FRE 611
recognizes  an  exception  to  this  rule,  permitting  leading  questions  to
be  asked  in  direct  examination  of  a  witness  associated  with  an
adverse  party.  Since  the  witness  is  employed  by  the  plaintiff's
adversary, the defendant, the objection should be overruled.

Leading  questions  may  also  be  asked  of  hostile  witnesses.  B  is
incorrect,  however,  because  a  hostile  witness  is  one  who  has
manifested  hostility  or  prejudice  under  examination,  and  there  is  no
indication  that  the  witness  did  so.  While  leading  questions  are
permitted on cross-examination, C is incorrect because the question
was  asked  on  direct  examination.  (Note:  The  facts  indicate  that  the
witness  was  called  by  the  plaintiff's  attorney  to  testify  on  the
presentation of the plaintiff's direct case.) Since the question made it
clear  that  the  examiner  wanted  an  affirmative  answer,  it  was  a
leading question. Thus, D is incorrect.

59.  D  One  who  engages  in  an  abnormally  dangerous  activity  is  strictly
liable for harm that proximately results from the dangerous nature of
that activity. Most jurisdictions hold that transporting large quantities
of any explosive substance is such an activity.

If  a  statute  is  designed  to  protect  a  class  of  persons  to  which  the
plaintiff  belongs  against  risks  like  the  one  that  resulted  in  harm,  its
violation may raise an inference or a presumption of negligence and
may  even  be  termed  negligence  per  se.  Since  the  statute  prohibited
parking  without  regard  to  a  vehicle's  contents,  it  was  obviously  not
designed  to  protect  against  risks  resulting  from  the  explosion  of  a
large quantity of gasoline. A and B are therefore incorrect. Since the
“No Parking” sign was also not designed to protect against this risk,
its violation is not relevant to determining whether the defendant was
negligent. For this reason, C is also incorrect.

60.  B  The  state  statute  could  result  in  depriving  the  girl's  parents  of  the
liberty  to  decide  what  treatment  their  daughter  should  receive.  The
Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require
that a law that regulates a liberty interest must be clear enough to be
understandable by the person of ordinary intelligence. Otherwise, the
law may be void for vagueness. The statutory use of the phrase “life-
threatening” could violate this requirement, since the meaning of that

1236

phrase may depend on the opinion of the person using it. The statutory
reference  to  “hospital  officials”  may  also  be  vague  since  it  is
impossible to tell which officials the statute designates. Although the
court might find that the statute is not vague, the argument set forth in
B  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  the  conclusion
that it is unconstitutional.

The  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits  invidious  discrimination  by
the states. A is incorrect because there is no indication that the statute
discriminates against any particular group. The Free Exercise Clause
prohibits  the  government  from  interfering  with  the  exercise  of
religious  beliefs.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  girl's  parents  have  not
claimed  that  their  refusal  to  consent  to  the  blood  transfusion  was
related  to  any  religious  belief  that  they  held.  (Note:  Beware  of
reading into a question facts that the examiners did not write into it.)
Determining  whether  a  statute  does  or  does  not  interfere  with  a
fundamental  right  is  relevant  in  selecting  the  standard  that  it  must
meet  to  be  valid.  D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  fact  that  a
statute interferes with a fundamental right is never in itself sufficient
to justify the conclusion that it is unconstitutional.

61.  B  Statements  by  a  now-unavailable  declarant  concerning  —  among
other things — the declarant's marriage, or relationship by blood or
marriage,  are  admissible  under  the  FRE  hearsay  exception  for
statements of personal history, and under the common law exception
for statements of pedigree. Since the mother was deceased at the time
of  trial,  she  was  unavailable.  Since  the  notations  contained  in  the
Bible were statements by the mother about her marriage to the man's
brother, about her relationship by marriage to the man, and about her
relationship  by  blood  to  the  niece,  it  qualifies  for  admission  under
both FRE 803(13) and the common law.

The  FRE  permit  the  admission,  as  an  “ancient  document,”  of  a
properly authenticated writing that is at least 20 years old. Common
law  usually  requires  30  years.  A  is  incorrect  under  both  systems,
however,  because  there  is  no  fact  indicating  the  age  of  the  mother's
notation in the Bible. In some jurisdictions, a law known as the “dead
man's  statute”  prevents  the  admission  of  certain  evidence  regarding
certain transactions with a person who is now deceased. Although the
dead  man's  statute  may  prevent  the  admission  of  evidence,  it  never
justifies  the  admission  of  evidence.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  Under

1237

FRE 803(9), “records of vital statistics,” including birth, death, and
marriage,  may  be  admissible  if  such  records  were  kept  by  a  public
office pursuant to the requirements of law. D is incorrect because the
notation  that  the  niece  offered  into  evidence  was  not  reported  to  or
kept by a public office pursuant to the requirements of law.

62. D Criminal conspiracy consists of an agreement between two or more
persons to commit a crime. When the defendant and the friend agreed
to  rob  a  bank,  the  crime  of  conspiracy  was  complete  —  whether  or
not they ever actually went through with the plan.

In  most  jurisdictions,  once  a  defendant  has  become  guilty  of  a
conspiracy (by agreeing to commit a crime), he or she cannot avoid
criminal  responsibility  for  the  crime  of  conspiracy  by  withdrawing
from or renouncing their plan. A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

63. C A defendant is liable for harm that proximately results from his or her
breach of a duty of reasonable care. Since a hotel keeper obviously
owes a duty of reasonable care to hotel guests, the defendant's failure
to  use  adequate  care  in  hiring  the  electrician  would  be  a  breach  of
that  duty,  making  the  defendant  liable  for  injuries  resulting  from  the
electrician's error.

Although  one  who  employs  an  independent  contractor  is  not
vicariously liable for torts committed by the contractor, the employer
may be liable for his or her own negligence in failing to use adequate
care in selecting the contractor. A is therefore incorrect. If reasonable
inspection  by  the  defendant  would  have  failed  to  disclose  the
electrician's  error,  then  the  defendant's  failure  to  discover  the
electrician's error would not be negligence. This alone would not be
enough to result in a judgment for the defendant, however, because the
defendant  may  have  committed  some  other  act  of  negligence  (e.g.,
failing  to  use  adequate  care  in  selecting  the  electrician)  for  which
liability can be imposed. B is therefore incorrect. Strict liability may
be imposed upon one who engages in (or employs another to engage
in)  an  ultra-hazardous  activity.  Strict  liability  does  not  apply,
however,  to  an  ordinary  activity  that  has  become  ultra-hazardous
because of a negligent error made by the person engaging in it. D is
therefore incorrect.

64. B A quitclaim deed conveys the interest held by the grantor at the time of
its execution. The wife could not own the entire Smith and Baker tract

1238

if  the  landowner  had  already  conveyed  part  of  it  to  the  sister.
Although  certain  methods  of  describing  realty  are  popular  or
traditional,  any  description  is  adequate  if  it  identifies  the  land
conveyed  with  reasonable  clarity.  Thus,  if  the  description  contained
in  the  landowner's  deed  to  the  sister  was  reasonably  sufficient  to
identify the property conveyed, it effectively conveyed that property.

A  conveyance  by  deed  usually  implies  a  warranty  of  title  which,  if
breached, may give the grantee a right of action against the grantor. A
quitclaim deed does not. But although one who receives a quitclaim
deed has no right of action for breach of warranty against the grantor,
the  quitclaim  deed  may  effectively  convey  whatever  interest  the
grantor  did  possess.  Thus,  if  the  landowner's  deed  to  the  sister  did
not  effectively  convey  part  of  the  Smith  and  Baker  tract,  his
conveyance  to  his  wife  by  quitclaim  could  have  been  sufficient  to
make her the owner of the entire Smith and Baker tract. A is therefore
incorrect. C and D are incorrect because a description is sufficient if
it identifies the realty conveyed with reasonable clarity.

65. B The United States Supreme Court has held that a public person suing
for defamation must prove “actual malice,” and that a private person
suing  a  media  defendant  for  defamation  must  prove  either  “actual
malice” or negligence. A defendant had “actual malice” if, at the time
he or she made a defamatory statement, he or she knew the statement
to be false or entertained serious doubts about its truth. A defendant
was negligent if at the time he or she made a defamatory statement, he
or  she  did  not  know  that  the  statement  was  false,  but  would  have
known  had  he  or  she  been  acting  reasonably.  If  officials  of  the
newspaper  believed  the  statement  was  true,  they  lacked  “actual
malice.”  If  their  belief  was  reasonable,  they  were  not  acting
negligently.  Thus,  if  they  had  a  reasonable  belief  in  the  truth  of  the
statement, the newspaper would not be liable for defamation.

Although some states recognize a privilege to publish false statements
that are contained in public records, there is no privilege to misstate
the contents of a public record. A is therefore incorrect. A defendant
who defamed a public figure may be liable if he or she had “actual
malice”  as  defined  above.  Thus,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  was  a
public  figure  would  not  be  sufficient  in  itself  to  protect  the
newspaper  against  liability  for  defaming  him.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.  A  plaintiff  asserting  a  claim  for  written  defamation  (i.e.,

1239

libel)  is  not  required  to  prove  damage  to  make  out  a  case  if  the
written  statement  was  defamatory  on  its  face.  Thus,  the  plaintiff's
failure to prove damage is not sufficient to prevent recovery. For this
reason, D is incorrect.

66.  C  The  Fourth  Amendment  guarantee  against  unreasonable  search  and
seizure  is  ordinarily  violated  when  a  search  is  conducted  without  a
warrant.  To  enforce  this  guarantee,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court
has ruled that the fruits of an unlawful search should be excluded from
evidence. A search occurs when there has been an invasion of an area
as  to  which  a  defendant  had  a  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy.
Since  the  defendant  was  the  only  person  who  had  a  key  to  the
footlocker, it was reasonable for him to expect that its contents would
remain  private.  For  this  reason,  the  officers'  first  look  into  the
footlocker  was  a  search.  Since  the  warrant  was  issued  because  of
what the officers found, its issuance was one of the fruits of that first
unlawful  search.  For  this  reason,  the  defendant's  motion  to  suppress
the  cocaine  must  be  granted.  (Note:  There  are  some  special
exceptions to the rule that a warrantless search is unlawful. The facts
in this case do not satisfy the requirements of any of these exceptions,
but  the  nature  of  the  question  only  makes  it  necessary  to  eliminate
those listed in the options.)

Consent by a third party to search the property of a defendant makes a
warrantless search lawful, but only if the person who consented had
rights in the property that were equal to those of the defendant. Since
the defendant was the only person who had a key to the footlocker, the
woman  did  not  have  rights  to  its  contents  that  were  equal  to  the
defendant's.  Thus,  her  consent  did  not  eliminate  the  need  for  a
warrant to search it. A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Even  the  consent  of  a
person who does not have an equal right to the premises might justify
a warrantless search if the police officers reasonably believed that he
or  she  had  such  a  right  (i.e.,  the  person  who  consented  had  the
“apparent authority” to do so). B is incorrect, however, because even
if  the  woman  had  apparent  authority  to  consent  to  a  search  of  the
room,  the  fact  that  the  defendant  had  the  only  key  to  the  footlocker
should have made it obvious to the officers that the woman's authority
did  not  extend  to  its  contents.  Probable  cause  justifies  an  arrest
without  a  warrant  but  does  not  justify  a  search  without  a  warrant.
Thus,  probable  cause  could  not  justify  the  first  search.  Although  a
search warrant may be issued upon a showing of probable cause, it is

1240

invalid  if  that  probable  cause  was  itself  the  fruit  of  an  unlawful
search.  Thus,  probable  cause  does  not  justify  the  issuance  of  the
warrant or the second search that was conducted pursuant to it. D is
therefore incorrect.

67.  A  Although  a  breach  of  contract  may  entitle  the  wronged  party  to
suspend his or her own performance, it does not always give him or
her the right to terminate the contract entirely. Fairness and the courts
ordinarily  require  that  the  breaching  party  be  allowed  a  reasonable
period of time in which to cure the breach. If it is cured within that
period, the breaching party may enforce the contract against the non-
breaching  party,  although  he  or  she  may  be  liable  for  damages
resulting  from  his  or  her  breach.  In  determining  whether  the  breach
was cured in a reasonable time, the courts consider the nature of the
contract  itself  and  the  circumstances  surrounding  its  formation.
Because  the  circumstances  contemplated  by  the  parties  made  it
essential that the conveyance occur on or before June 15, the court is
likely  to  determine  that  a  conveyance  on  June  16  did  not  cure  the
breach.

Sometimes  the  phrase  “time  is  of  the  essence”  is  inserted  in  a
contract  to  make  it  clear  that  the  circumstances  contemplated  by  the
parties did make it essential that performance occur by a certain date.
Since  those  circumstances  may  be  found  to  exist  even  without  the
insertion  of  specific  language,  however,  its  insertion  is  not  the  only
thing  that  would  result  in  a  judgment  for  the  buyer.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. Even if the seller's breach resulted in damage to the buyer,
a court could find that the breach was cured within a reasonable time,
and that therefore the buyer's only remedy is damages. C is therefore
incorrect. D  is  incorrect  because  contract  liability  does  not  depend
on fault and may be imposed in spite of reasonable efforts to comply
with the contract.

68.  D  One  who  engages  in  an  ultra-hazardous  or  abnormally  dangerous
activity  is  strictly  liable  for  damage  that  proximately  results
therefrom. Since most jurisdictions agree that storing poisonous gases
is an ultra-hazardous or abnormally dangerous activity, proof that the
gas is extremely deadly would be sufficient to result in the imposition
of strict liability on the defendant.

One who places a defective product — whether defective in design
or in manufacture — in the stream of commerce may be held strictly

1241

liable  for  damage  resulting  from  the  product  defect.  A  is  incorrect,
however, because the defendant did not place the tank in the stream of
commerce. B and C are incorrect because the defendant did not place
the gas that injured the plaintiff in the stream of commerce.

69. A Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(b), the party using an expert witness
must automatically supply a written report containing “(i) a complete
statement  of  all  opinions  the  witness  will  express  and  the  basis  and
reasons  for  them;  (ii)  the  facts  or  data  considered  by  the  witness  in
forming them; [and] (iii) any exhibits that will be used to summarize
or support them.” Consequently, the airline's attorney does not need to
do anything to know the details of the expert's research before trial.

Therefore, B, C, and D are incorrect.

70. A Lay witnesses are generally permitted to testify only to facts. When it
would be helpful to a clear understanding of the witness's testimony,
however,  the  opinion  of  a  lay  witness  may  be  admissible  if  it  is
rationally based on the perceptions of the witness. The decision as to
whether this is so and as to whether the lay opinion is admissible is
made in the court's discretion. Therefore, if the judge decides that the
witness's  opinion  is  rationally  based  on  her  perceptions,  it  is
admissible.  Conversely,  unless  the  judge  so  decides,  the  witness's
opinion should be excluded.

So long as they do not go beyond matters in common knowledge, lay
opinions  about  the  physical  and  mental  condition  of  another  are
usually  admissible.  For  this  reason,  an  opinion  that  another  person
was intoxicated is admissible (so long as it is rationally based on the
witness's  perceptions)  even  if  the  witness  is  not  an  expert  on
intoxication.  B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  The  admissibility  of
opinion evidence is a question of law for the judge. This means that
the  judge  cannot  admit  the  witness's  opinion  testimony  unless  he  or
she finds it to be rationally based on the witness's perceptions, and he
or  she  cannot  delegate  that  responsibility  to  the  jury.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

71. C The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits
a  state  from  denying  persons  within  its  jurisdiction  the  equal
protection of the law. A system of classification contained in social or
economic  legislation  is  usually  presumed  to  comply  with  this
requirement  so  long  as  it  has  some  rational  basis.  When  the

1242

classification is a “suspect” one, the presumption of constitutionality
is inverted, and the statute is unconstitutional unless it is necessary to
serve  a  compelling  state  interest.  Since  alienage  is  a  “suspect
classification,” a statute that discriminates against aliens is ordinarily
required  to  meet  the  compelling  state  interest  test.  Under  the
“political function” exception, however, a statute that prevents aliens
from holding a particular state job may be constitutionally valid if the
job is one that should be performed only by people familiar with and
sympathetic to American traditions. The Supreme Court has held that
the only jobs falling into this category are those that invest the public
employee with the power to make policy or with broad discretion in
executing public policy.

A is incorrect because not all “traditional” government activities fall
into  this  category.  Since  alienage  is  a  suspect  classification,  B  is
incorrect  because  a  rational  basis  is  not  sufficient  to  justify  a
classification  based  on  alienage.  Statutes 
interfere  with
fundamental interests — like those based on “suspect classifications”
—  are  also  subject  to  the  compelling  state  interest  standard.  D  is
incorrect,  however,  because  a  classification  based  on  alienage  is
“suspect,”  making  the  compelling  state  interest  standard  applicable
even if the right with which the statute interferes is not a fundamental
one.

that 

72.  D  Unless  the  parties  stipulate  otherwise,  a  jury  verdict  must  be

unanimous. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 48(b).

A and B are incorrect because the jury must have between 6 and 12
members. C is  incorrect  because  the  Seventh  Amendment  generally
does  not  give  a  right  to  a  jury  trial  for  parties  seeking  an  equitable
claim such as an injunction.

73. C Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over claims that arise
under federal law. See 28 U.S.C. §1331. Since the woman is making a
claim based on the federal National Labor Relations Act, the federal
district court in State A has jurisdiction over the matter.

Because the woman is bringing a federal claim, any issues regarding
the  citizenship  of  the  parties  are  irrelevant.  Therefore,  A, B,  and  D
are incorrect.

74. B Negligence  is  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  This  duty  is
breached  by  a  defendant's  failure  to  act  like  the  reasonable  person.

1243

Thus, unless the reasonable person would have repaired the fence, the
defendant's failure to do so was not negligent.

In  most  jurisdictions,  a  person  who  keeps  a  wild  animal  is  strictly
liable  for  damage  that  it  causes.  The  jurisdictions  that  do  not  apply
this  rule  generally  hold  that  keeping  a  wild  animal  is  prima  facie
negligent.  Neither  rule  is  applied,  however,  unless  the  injury
sustained by the plaintiff resulted from the wild and dangerous nature
of  the  animal  involved.  Since  even  a  domestic  animal  might  knock
over a fence that has become badly deteriorated, the plaintiff's injury
did not result from the wild and dangerous nature of the defendant's
cougar.  For  this  reason,  A  is  incorrect.  In  deciding  whether  a
defendant's  conduct  was  negligent,  it  is  compared  to  that  of  the
reasonable  person.  What  matters  is  not  what  the  defendant  actually
knew  about  the  risks,  but  what  the  reasonable  person  in  the
defendant's  position  would  have  known  about  those  risks.  C  is
incorrect because the issue was whether a reasonable person would
repair  the  fence.  A  plaintiff  assumes  a  risk  when,  knowing  that  it
exists,  he  or  she  voluntarily  encounters  it.  D  is  incorrect  because
there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  the  plaintiff  knew  that  the  fence  was
deteriorated enough to create a risk that the cougar would injure her.

75.  B  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  unenforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration 
is  a  bargained-for  exchange  of
something  of  value  given  in  return  for  and  to  induce  a  promise.  It
usually  consists  of  some  benefit  conferred  upon  the  promisor  or  of
some  detriment  incurred  by  the  promisee.  Consistent  with  this
definition  is  the  rule  that  a  promisee's  undertaking  to  do  something
that he or she is already legally obligated to do (i.e., performance of a
preexisting  duty)  is  not  consideration  for  a  new  promise  by  the
promisor because it does not confer on the promisor any benefit that
he or she was not already entitled to receive and does not impose on
the  promisee  any  detriment  that  he  or  she  had  not  already  incurred.
Since all that the worker gave the farmer in return for his promise to
pay  for  the  tractor  rental  was  her  promise  that  she  would  finish
plowing by April 1, and since she was already legally obligated to do
so,  the  farmer  may  successfully  argue  that  his  promise  was
unsupported  by  consideration.  [Note:  Although  UCC  §2-209(1)
permits the modification of a sales contract between merchants to be
enforced  without  consideration,  it  is  inapplicable  here  because  this
was not a contract for sale.]

1244

Although the Statute of Frauds makes an oral contract for the purchase
of goods with a price of $500 or more unenforceable over objection,
A  is  incorrect  because  the  agreement  between  the  farmer  and  the
worker was not for the sale of goods. Duress is some compulsion or
restraint  that  deprives  a  contracting  party  of  the  ability  to  exercise
free will and usually involves some physical force or threat. A few
cases  have  recognized  the  possibility  of  economic  duress,  but  this
defense  is  rarely  applied,  and  when  it  is,  it  involves  much  more
desperate  economic  threats  than  any  indicated  by  the  facts  in  this
case. C is incorrect for this reason and because a party to a contract
is  expected  to  show  reasonable  firmness  in  asserting  his  or  her
contract  rights.  Since  the  farmer  failed  to  object  to  the  additional
charge, it is unlikely that a court would conclude that he did so under
duress. When a promise would ordinarily be unenforceable because
it  is  unsupported  by  consideration  or  because  it  fails  to  satisfy  the
Statute of Frauds, justified detrimental reliance by the promisee may
result  in  enforcement  on  a  theory  of  promissory  estoppel.  D  is
incorrect,  however,  because  the  farmer's  reliance  on  the  worker's
promise is not relevant to the worker's attempt to enforce the farmer's
promise.

76. C The landowner's conveyance made his son a life tenant. A life tenant
may convey that interest. When the son quitclaimed his interest in the
land,  the  wife  gained  a  life  estate  per  autre  vie,  or  a  life  estate
measured by the life of another. Here, the wife would get what the son
had, specifically a life estate measured by the son's life. The daughter
continued  to  hold  a  remainder  in  fee  simple,  since  the  conveyance
gave  “the  remainder  to  my  daughter”  without  any  limitation.
Ultimately,  the  daughter  would  get  the  land  from  the  wife  when  the
son died. The fact that the landowner did not give the son permission
to quitclaim his interest does not change the analysis.

Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

77. B False pretenses consists of obtaining title to another's property by a
knowing  false  statement  of  present  or  past  fact  with  the  intent  to
defraud.  Here,  the  dealer  obtained  title  to  the  man's  money  by
knowingly  lying  about  the  fact  the  car  was  not  a  new  car.
Consequently,  he  could  be  charged  with  this  crime,  and  D  is
incorrect.

A is incorrect because larceny by trick happens when a victim merely

1245

transfers  custody  of  his  or  her  property,  not  title.  C  is  incorrect
because embezzlement requires the person to convert property he or
she is already in lawful possession of. Here, the dealer was clearly
not already in lawful possession of the man's money before the man
gave it to him based on his belief he was buying a new car.

78.  A  Federal  courts  of  appeal  review  a  district  court's  determination
regarding  unsettled  state  law  de  novo.  Consequently,  a  court  of
appeals should not defer to a district court's decision.

B is incorrect because a federal court sitting in diversity must apply
the  substantive  law  of  the  state  in  which  it  is  sitting.  See  Erie
Railroad  v.  Tompkins,  304  U.S.  64  (1938).  C  is  incorrect  because
federal courts follow federal procedural law. D is incorrect because
statutes of limitations are substantive law when determining whether
to  apply  federal  or  state  law.  See  Guaranty  Trust  Co.  v.  York,  326
U.S.  99  (1945).  Consequently,  a  federal  court  should  follow  the
statute of limitations rules of the state in which it is sitting.

79. C Exigent circumstances justify a warrantless entry into a home if police
officers  are  assisting  an  injured  occupant  or  preventing  imminent
injury.  Exigent  circumstances  also  include  preventing  the  imminent
destruction of evidence and searching in “hot pursuit” for a suspect.
Here,  the  officer  heard  the  men  fighting,  and  entered  the  home  to
prevent  imminent  injury.  He  then  discovered  the  drug  evidence  in
plain  view.  A  is  incorrect  because  exigent  circumstances  were
present.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  plain  view  doctrine  applies  to
situations  where  police  see  evidence  of  a  crime  from  a  location
where they have a right to be. Here, the plain view doctrine does not
address  the  officer's  initial  entry  into  the  house.  D  is  incorrect
because the issue here is exigent circumstances, not probable cause.
Additionally,  the  validity  of  a  search  does  not  depend  on  whether
there was probable cause for the suspect's ultimate arrest.

80. A UCC §1-205 defines usage of trade as a practice or method of dealing
that  is  regularly  observed  in  a  particular  industry.  UCC  §2-202
permits  evidence  of  usage  of  trade  to  explain  the  terms  of  a  written
contract, even when the contract was intended to be a final expression
of the agreement of the parties.

B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Ordinarily,  parties  to  a  contract  are
understood  to  accept  the  economic  risks  resulting  from  subsequent

1246

events  that  were  within  their  contemplation  at  the  time  the  contract
was formed. This means that if the parties did contemplate a decline
in new home starts, a strong argument could be made that the builder
should  be  bound  by  the  20,000-board-feet  minimum  set  forth  in  the
contract. The fact that they did not contemplate such a decline in new
homes, if relevant at all, is thus more likely to support the builder's
position than it is to support the supplier's. In any event, although the
contemplation of the parties might help determine the meaning of the
terms that they used, it is not the only factor to be considered. In fact,
the  UCC  specifically  permits  evidence  of  trade  usage  to  be
considered as well. C is therefore incorrect. Ordinarily, in construing
contracts, courts consider the manifest intentions of the parties and do
so by examining the language of the written agreement between them.
A problem may arise, however, since the words used may have meant
different things to the different parties. Since trade usage may indicate
the  meaning  that  certain  terms  generally  have  for  people  in  the
industry  involved,  the  UCC  provision  regarding  trade  usage  is
designed to help determine what the parties meant by the terms they
used.  If,  for  example,  it  was  generally  understood  in  the  trade  that
minimum  requirements  were  inapplicable  in  times  of  falling  prices,
the parties might have specified a minimum number, meaning it to be
applicable only if prices did not fall, even though this intention would
not be apparent to persons not in the trade. The argument set forth in
D, however, is based on what the language means to people who are
unaware of its special trade usage. For this reason, D is incorrect.

81. B The United States Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment of
the  United  States  Constitution  requires  a  public  official  or  public
figure  suing  for  defamation  to  prove  that  the  defendant  had  actual
malice  in  making  the  defamatory  statement.  The  Court  defined  a
public official as a public employee who has or reasonably appears
to  have  substantial  control  over  the  conduct  of  public  affairs.  The
plaintiffs  are  clearly  public  employees.  Whether  they  reasonably
appear to have substantial control over the conduct of public affairs
may be a question of fact, but B is the only argument listed that could
possibly result in a judgment for the newspaper.

The United States Supreme Court has said that there is no such thing
as  a  false  idea.  Since  defamation  liability  cannot  be  imposed  for
publication of the truth, this statement by the Supreme Court prevents
defamation  liability  from  being  imposed  for  the  publication  of  an

1247

opinion.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  —  even  though  it  was
contained  in  an  editorial  —  the  statement  that  the  majority  of
firefighters  were  dangerously  out  of  shape  and  had  recently  failed
their physicals is obviously an assertion of fact. The Supreme Court
has  defined  a  public  figure  as  either  one  who  has  achieved  such
“pervasive  fame  and  notoriety”  that  he  or  she  is  known  to  the  great
mass of humanity, or one who has voluntarily “mounted the rostrum”
in  an  attempt  to  influence  public  opinion  on  a  matter  of  public
controversy.  C  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that
either  definition  applies  to  the  plaintiffs.  In  addition,  C  is  incorrect
because  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  a  defendant  may  not
successfully  argue  that  the  plaintiff  has  become  a  public  figure  as  a
result of the defamatory statements that the defendant published about
the  plaintiff.  D  is  incorrect  since  the  Supreme  Court's  definition  of
“public official” makes it clear that not all public employees fit into
this category.

82. B Under UCC §2-609, whenever it reasonably appears that a party to a
sales contract will be unable to perform as required, the other party
may  demand  an  adequate  assurance  of  performance.  If  the  party  on
whom  such  demand  is  made  fails  to  respond  within  a  reasonable
period  of  time,  the  party  making  that  demand  may  treat  the  other
party's  prospective  inability  to  perform  as  a  repudiation.  Since  the
destruction of the plaintiff's only factory raised reasonable questions
about whether the plaintiff would be able to perform as required, the
police department was entitled to demand assurances as it did in its
letter  of  July  10.  When  the  plaintiff  failed  to  respond  within  a
reasonable  time,  the  police  department  was  relieved  of  any  further
obligation to perform.

When unforeseen circumstances eliminate the underlying reasons for
contracting,  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose  may  excuse
performance by the parties. (If, for example, all the criminals in the
city stopped using guns so that there was no longer any reason for the
police  department  to  need  bulletproof  vests,  the  doctrine  of
frustration  of  purpose  might  relieve  it  of  its  obligation  to  continue
purchasing  vests  from  the  plaintiff.)  A  is  incorrect  because  the
underlying reasons for the agreement between the police department
and  the  plaintiff  (i.e.,  the  police  department's  need  for  bulletproof
vests)  continued  to  exist  even  though  the  plaintiff's  factory  was
destroyed. An agreement calling for a series of performances by the

1248

parties may be regarded as a single contract or as a series of separate
ones. Calling it “divisible” simply means that the court will treat it as
a  series  of  separate  contracts.  It  is  difficult  to  tell  from  the  facts
whether the contract between the defendant and the police department
is  or  is  not  “divisible.”  In  either  event,  however,  whether  it  is  a
breach of a single agreement calling for a series of performances, or
of one of the separate agreements that result from calling the contract
divisible, the defendant's failure to deliver bulletproof vests might be
a breach. Therefore, determining that the contract was divisible is not
relevant  in  determining  whether  failure  to  perform  constitutes  a
breach,  so  C  is  incorrect.  Even  before  the  time  of  performance,  a
party  may  treat  the  other  party's  repudiation  as  a  breach.  Thus,  a
repudiation by the police department might provide the plaintiff with
an  argument  in  support  of  its  position,  but  it  would  not  provide  the
police  department  with  support  for  its  position.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

83.  C  Negligence  is  unreasonable  conduct  when  one  has  a  duty  to  act
reasonably.  Importantly,  a  person  cannot  be  negligent  if  he  or  she
acted  reasonably.  Consequently,  only  unreasonable  conduct  on  the
limousine driver's part can result in a judgment against him. Here, if a
court finds it was unreasonable for the driver to swerve to avoid the
dog,  he  would  be  liable  for  negligence.  A  is  incorrect  because  the
doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is  used  in  cases  where  the  defendant's
conduct  is  unknown.  In  that  case,  it  allows  a  plaintiff  to  create  an
inference  that  the  defendant  acted  unreasonably  by  relying  on
circumstantial  evidence.  In  that  case,  the  evidence  has  to  show  that
the accident was one that would not normally have occurred without
negligence,  under  circumstances  that  eliminated  all  probabilities
other than the negligence of the defendant. Here, such circumstantial
evidence  is  unnecessary  because  the  limousine  driver's  conduct  in
swerving to avoid the dog was known. Under negligence per se, the
defendant is negligent if, without excuse, he or she violates a statute
that  is  designed  to  protect  against  the  type  of  accident  that  the
defendant's conduct causes, and the accident victim is within the class
of  persons  the  statute  is  designed  to  protect.  The  important  point  is
that  the  violation  must  cause  the  accident.  Since  the  accident  would
have happened even if the limousine driver had insurance, there is no
causal link between the violation and the statute. Thus, B is incorrect.
D  is  incorrect  because  even  if  the  limousine  driver  owed  some

1249

special  duty  to  the  teenagers,  he  still  would  have  had  to  act
unreasonably before he could be found liable.

84. C Under the statute, the defendant can be guilty of second degree murder
only if the victim dies during the course of the commission of one of
the  enumerated  felonies.  Nothing  in  the  facts  suggests  that  the
defendant or the friend was committing a rape, kidnapping, burglary,
or arson. Robbery is a larceny that is committed by force or a threat
of  force  against  a  human  being.  Larceny  is  a  trespassory  taking  and
carrying off of personal property known to be another's with the intent
to  permanently  deprive  the  other  of  it.  Since  the  jury  believed  the
defendant's testimony, the coat that she was attempting to obtain from
the victim was her own. Her taking it could not, therefore, constitute a
larceny, and her use of force to take it was not a robbery.

A and B are incorrect because if a death occurs during the course of
one  of  the  felonies  specified,  the  felony  murder  rule  is  frequently
applied  even  though  the  death  was  unforeseeable.  Since  the  statute
provides  that  an  unintentional  killing  is  second  degree  murder  if
perpetrated by the defendant or an accomplice during the course of a
listed crime, D is obviously incorrect.

85. C Since the notary received his interest from the barber, the validity of
the notary's title depends on the validity of the barber's title. For this
reason,  if  the  barber's  title  is  superior  to  that  of  the  landowner's
cousin, then so is the notary's. The validity of the barber's title (and
therefore of the notary's) depends on the recording statute. The statute
given  is  a  typical  “race-notice”  statute.  According  to  its  provisions,
the  interest  of  a  subsequent  grantee  for  value  and  without  notice  is
superior to that of a prior grantee unless the prior grantee's interest is
recorded  before  the  subsequent  grantee's  interest  is  recorded.  Thus,
since  the  landowner's  cousin's  interest  was  recorded  before  the
barber's, it was superior to the barber's (and therefore to the notary's).

A  is  incorrect  because  although  the  statute  makes  the  payment  of
value  a  condition  for  the  superiority  of  a  subsequent  grantee's
interest, it does not impose such a requirement on the prior grantee.
Since the “race” aspect of the statute makes priority depend on who
recorded first, the fact that the barber recorded before selling to the
notary  would  not  defeat  the  landowner's  cousin's  interest  since  the
barber  recorded  after  the  cousin  did.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.
Recording  is  “outside  the  chain  of  title”  if  it  could  not  have  been

1250

discovered  by  a  reasonable  title  search.  (For  example,  since  the
cousin recorded before the barber, a reasonable title search might not
have disclosed a record of the deed from the landowner to the barber.
This is because after finding a record of the landowner's grant to the
cousin,  the  searcher  would  have  expected  that  the  next  grant  of  an
interest in the property was by the cousin and would have no reason
to search for a subsequent grant by the landlord.) Most jurisdictions
hold that a recording outside the chain of title is no recording at all
since  it  does  not  give  the  reasonable  searcher  notice  of  the
transaction. D is incorrect, however, because if the barber recorded
prior  to  the  cousin,  the  recording  of  the  landowner's  grant  to  the
barber would have been within the chain of title.

86. D If the defendant is the initial aggressor, he or she may not claim self-
defense. Importantly, the defendant can be an aggressor, and lose the
right of self-defense, even if the defendant did not actually strike the
first  blow.  If  a  defendant  does  an  unlawful  act  that  intentionally
provokes the physical conflict, the defendant becomes the aggressor.
Here, the defendant provoked the robber by telling the robber that the
defendant would shoot him through the windshield if the robber tried
to  leave.  Consequently,  the  defendant  became  the  aggressor  and  lost
his claim of self-defense.

For  a  self-defense  claim,  the  harm  being  defended  against  must  be
reasonably imminent. While the danger that someone will be attacked
tomorrow  is  likely  insufficient  to  support  a  claim  of  self-defense,
courts will not make the defendant wait until the absolute last second
before he or she can defend himself or herself. Here, even though the
robber  was  still  getting  out  of  his  car,  a  court  would  likely  find  the
danger  was  reasonably  imminent.  Thus,  A  is  incorrect.  In  a  self-
defense  claim,  the  defendant  may  not  use  more  force  than  seems
reasonably necessary in the circumstances. Here, a large axe is likely
a use of deadly force. Consequently, the defendant's use of the pistol
was not more force than was necessary and B is incorrect. While the
robber  had  already  attempted  to  withdraw,  the  real  issue  is  the
defendant's provocation, so C is incorrect.

87.  A  In  Minnesota  v.  Olson,  495  U.S.  91  (1990),  the  United  States
Supreme Court held that an overnight guest has a legitimate interest in
privacy in the residence where he or she is staying. Consequently, the
police had to obtain a search warrant before they could lawfully enter

1251

the apartment because the man was staying there for a week and was
thus an overnight guest. Therefore, D is incorrect.

B is  incorrect  because  the  plain  view  exception  only  applies  when
the  police  see  evidence  from  a  place  they  are  lawfully  able  to  be.
Here, the police only saw the marijuana once they unlawfully entered
the apartment. C is  incorrect  because  even  if  the  neighbors  smelled
the marijuana, this was not an exigent circumstance or other exception
that would relieve the police from having to obtain a search warrant.

88. D One who holds a present possessory interest in real estate is entitled
to make all normal uses of the land and to keep the profits from those
uses so long as he or she does not unreasonably decrease its value to
the holders of future interests. This means, among other things, that the
holder  of  a  present  possessory  interest  in  realty  is  permitted  to  rent
the realty and to keep the rent. For this reason, the accountant has no
right to the rents. On the other hand, since the permanent removal of
minerals from the land will inevitably reduce the value of the realty,
limitations  on  the  removal  of  minerals  are  imposed  on  holders  of
certain present possessory interests. If, however, the grantor had been
actively  removing  minerals  from  the  realty,  it  is  presumed  that  in
granting a present possessory interest, the grantor intended to grant the
right to continue removing minerals as well. Since the landowner had
been  mining  the  gold  on  the  land,  it  is  presumed  that  he  intended  to
grant the friend the right to continue doing so, even though the friend's
interest in the realty was less than a fee. Thus, the accountant is not
entitled to proceeds from the mining operation, either.

For  the  combination  of  reasons  given  above,  A,  B,  and  C  are
incorrect.

89. B. A question of fact is an issue in the case that is decided by looking at
the facts in evidence. The validity of the rock singer's signature would
be a question of fact. A trial court's findings regarding a question of
fact  will  not  be  disturbed  unless  they  are  “clearly  erroneous.”  See
Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6).

A  is  incorrect  because  a  question  of  law  is  an  issue  that  must  be
decided by applying legal principles (for example, whether a police
officer had probable cause to arrest a suspect). C and D are incorrect
the
because  abuse  of  discretion  is  the  standard  applied  to 
discretionary decisions of a trial court, such as leaves to amend.

1252

90.  C  FRE  801(d)(1)(B)  specifies  that  a  prior  consistent  statement  of  a
declarant is not hearsay if the declarant has testified and is available
for cross-examination, and if the statement is offered to rebut a claim
of  recent  fabrication.  Since  the  victim  testified  that  the  defendant
raped her, and since the defendant claimed that the victim's complaint
was  fabricated  on  April  3,  evidence  that  the  victim  made  that  same
complaint  to  the  neighbor  on  March  7  tends  to  rebut  the  defendant's
claim. The neighbor's testimony is therefore admissible.

Under FRE 803(2), a statement is admissible as an excited utterance
if it was made about a startling event while the declarant was under
the stress of excitement caused by that event. Ordinarily, this requires
the  statement  to  have  been  made  either  during  the  event  or
immediately  thereafter.  Since  a  week  passed  between  the  alleged
rape and the victim's statement to the neighbor, it probably does not
qualify  as  an  excited  utterance.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Hearsay  is
defined  as  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  for  the  purpose  of
proving the truth of the matter asserted in that statement. If the victim's
out-of-court statement to the neighbor is not offered to prove the truth
of what she asserted (i.e., that the defendant raped her) but is offered
to prove that she did not fabricate her complaint after learning that the
defendant  was  married,  it  is  not  hearsay.  FRE  801(d)(1)(B)
specifically  provides  that  such  a  statement  “is  not  hearsay.”  This
means that in addition to being admissible for the purpose of rebutting
the defendant's claim of recent fabrication, the victim's statement may
be  admissible  as  substantive  evidence  as  well.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. FRE 803(1) recognizes a hearsay exception for a statement
of  the  declarant's  sense  impressions.  This  exception  applies,
however, only when the declarant's statement describing an event is
made  during  or  immediately  after  the  event.  Since  the  victim's
statement to the neighbor was made a week after the incident that it
purported to describe, D is incorrect.

91.  D  Since  the  formal  requirements  for  wills  are  more  demanding  than
those for deeds, a deed that is intended to take effect only on the death
of the grantor (i.e.,  a  testamentary  substitute)  is  invalid.  Thus,  if  the
woman  intended  for  the  quitclaim  deed  to  have  no  effect  until  after
her  death,  it  is  invalid.  Although  the  facts  make  it  impossible  to
determine  with  certainty  what  the  woman's  intention  was,  D  is  the
only  argument  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  a  judgment  for  the
nurse.

1253

A  is  incorrect  because  recording  statutes  protect  only  those  who
purchase  for  value.  Since  the  nurse  received  by  will  and  without
consideration,  the  husband's  failure  to  record  would  not  give  the
nurse  a  priority.  Although  a  quitclaim  deed  does  not  imply  any
warranties  or  covenants,  it  does  serve  to  transfer  whatever  interest
the  grantor  held  at  the  time  of  its  execution.  B  and  C  are  therefore
incorrect.

92. B Assault  is  the  intentional  causing  of  an  apprehension  of  harmful  or
offensive  contact.  Importantly,  the  doctrine  of  transferred  intent
applies  to  assault.  Under  this  doctrine,  if  the  defendant  had  the
necessary intent with respect to one person, he or she will be held to
have  committed  an  intentional  tort  against  any  other  person  who
happens to be injured. Here, the boy clearly intended to frighten the
babysitter. Thus, even though the boy intended to scare his babysitter,
the  fact  that  his  sister  was  nearby  and  was  put  in  apprehension  of
harmful  or  offensive  contact  (i.e.,  she  ducked)  was  enough  for
liability. A  is  incorrect  because  the  boy  could  also  have  been  held
liable for battery since he did in fact hit the babysitter. Importantly, a
defendant has the necessary intent for battery if he intended to cause
an  imminent  apprehension  on  the  plaintiff's  part  of  a  harmful  or
offensive  contact.  Basically,  the  intent  to  commit  an  assault  is
sufficient for battery. C is incorrect because if the defendant intends
to  frighten  the  plaintiff,  he  has  the  necessary  intent  for  assault.  D  is
incorrect because in the case of battery or assault, it is not necessary
that the defendant bear malice or hostility toward the plaintiff.

93. B It has been said that the offeror is monarch of the offer. This means, of
course,  that  the  person  who  institutes  the  contractual  process  by
making an offer is in complete control of that offer's terms and, upon
acceptance,  is  not  bound  to  any  terms  other  than  those.  Since  the
buyer's offer was to pay $100 for information “leading to purchase of
an  antique  car,”  he  is  not  required  to  pay  unless  the  information
furnished  actually  leads  to  the  purchase  of  an  antique  car.  Since  the
man's letter did not, it does not qualify the man to receive the reward.

A is incorrect because an offer to the general public that is made by
advertisement  ordinarily  is  not  revoked  until  a  withdrawal  is  given
approximately  equal  publicity.  C  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the
buyer only offered to pay for information leading to purchase, and the
man's did not.

1254

94  A  When  a  safety  statute  is  violated,  courts  will  find  an  unexcused
violation  of  that  statute  negligence  per  se.  There  are  three  main
requirements  for  application  of  negligence  per  se:  1)  the  defendant
violated  a  statute,  2)  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect  against  the
same  type  of  accident  that  occurred,  and  3)  the  accident  victim  is  a
member  of  the  class  of  persons  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect.
Here,  all  three  elements  were  satisfied  because  the  manufacturer
failed  to  provide  a  warning,  the  warning  would  have  protected
against the man's skin discoloration, and the man was a member of the
class  (a  user  of  the  cream)  that  the  statute  was  designed  to  protect.
However,  even  when  negligence  per  se  applies,  the  plaintiff  must
still  show  a  causal  link  between  the  violation  and  the  injury.  Here,
since the man admitted that no one in his household read the warnings,
there was no causal link, since the harm would have occurred even if
the warning was inside the packaging. B is incorrect because the main
issue  here  is  the  lack  of  the  warning  in  the  package,  not  the  man's
continued  use  of  the  cream.  C  is  incorrect,  because  there  was  no
causal link between the harm and the failure to provide the warning.
D is  incorrect  because  it  fails  to  take  into  account  whether  the  man
would have read or even followed the warning.

95. B A proceeding is moot when there are no contested material issues for
the  court  to  decide.  Since  the  girl  has  died,  the  state  court  can  no
longer  appoint  the  hospital  administrator  her  guardian.  Since  the
purpose  of  the  federal  proceeding  was  to  stop  the  state  proceeding,
and since the state proceeding must terminate in any event, there is no
longer  any  contested  issue  before  the  federal  court.  The  issues  have
thus  become  moot.  An  exception  to  the  mootness  rule  exists  when  a
controversy  is  capable  of  repetition  and  evading  judicial  review.
Under this exception, the federal court might decide to hear the case
even though the girl's death has made it moot. Mootness, however, is
the only argument listed that could possibly result in dismissal of the
proceeding brought by the girl's parents.

A  non-justiciable  political  controversy  is  a  case  in  which  a  federal
court is asked to interfere with the operation of a co-equal branch of
the  federal  government.  A  is  incorrect  because  the  challenge  raised
by the girl's parents is to a state law, not to an action of the federal
government.  The  Eleventh  Amendment  prohibits  federal  courts  from
hearing  certain  claims  against  state  governments.  C  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  Eleventh  Amendment  does  not  prevent  the

1255

federal  courts  from  hearing  claims  that  state  action  violates  the
United  States  Constitution.  Where  a  pending  state  court  proceeding
might  result  in  an  interpretation  of  or  a  conclusion  about  a  state
statute that would resolve a federal challenge to it, federal courts are
usually  unwilling  to  enjoin  enforcement  of  that  statute.  The  reason
given is sometimes said to be “equitable restraint.” It is not related,
however,  to  the  question  of  ripeness.  So  long  as  there  is  someone
who can actually benefit from a resolution of the issues, and so long
as the issues are fully developed and clearly defined, those issues are
ripe. Thus, although the issues in this case may no longer be “ripe,”
this is not because the highest state court has not decided, but because
there  is  no  longer  any  person  who  will  actually  benefit  from  a
resolution of the issues. D is therefore incorrect.

96. A Economic  regulation  by  the  state  is  constitutionally  valid  if  it  has  a
rational basis. The “pay-to-throw” program is an economic regulation
and therefore is subject to the rational basis standard. Obviously, any
legal requirement of payment may have the effect of discriminating in
favor  of  the  wealthy  against  the  poor.  However,  the  United  States
Supreme  Court  has  rejected  arguments  that  classifications  based  on
wealth  are  “suspect.”  Consequently,  B  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect
because  even 
interference  with  a  fundamental  right  may  be
constitutional  if  it  is  necessary  to  serve  a  compelling  state  interest.
laws  discriminate  against  somebody  (e.g.,  penal  codes
All 
discriminate  against  criminals).  Thus,  unless  a  law  has  no  rational
basis (in the case of certain kinds of regulation) or is not necessary to
serve  a  compelling  interest  of  the  state  (as  in  other  kinds  of
regulation),  the  fact  that  it  discriminates  against  a  discrete  class  of
persons is not enough to make it unconstitutional. Thus, D is incorrect.

97.  B  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  there  was
consideration  for  it  (i.e.,  something  given  in  exchange  for  and  to
induce  the  promise).  Since  the  man  had  already  rescued  the  dog
without expectation of payment, the rescue was not given in exchange
for  or  to  induce  the  dog  owner's  promise  and  is  therefore  not
consideration for it. Some cases have held, however, that a promise
to  do  that  which  the  promisor  is  morally  obligated  to  do  should  be
enforceable  even  without  consideration.  Although 
is  an
infrequently  applied  exception  to  the  requirement  of  consideration,
the argument set forth in B is the only one listed that could possibly
provide the man with effective support for his claim.

this

Since  the  man  had  already  rescued  the  dog  without  expecting
compensation, the rescue was not given in exchange for or to induce
the  dog  owner's  promise.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  In  determining
whether  to  rescind  a  contract  because  of  mutual  mistake,  fraud,
duress,  or  undue  influence,  the  court  may  attempt  to  decide  whether
its  failure  to  rescind  would  unjustly  enrich  one  of  the  parties.
Ordinarily, however, the fact that a party will be unjustly enriched by
something  is  not  in  itself  sufficient  to  result  in  the  imposition  of
contractual  duty  on  the  party.  C  is  incorrect  for  this  reason  and
because the fact that the man rescued the dog without expectation of
payment  probably  prevents  the  dog  owner's  enrichment  from  being
unjust.  Sometimes  a  promise  that  is  unsupported  by  consideration
will  be  enforced  under  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  if  the
promisee  justifiably  relied  upon  it  to  his  or  her  detriment.  D  is
incorrect, however, because while the man did rely on the promise to
his  detriment,  there  is  no  indication  the  dog  owner  should  have
foreseen such reliance.

98. D Since there is no evidence that the defendant in the question scenario
intended  to  cause  death  or  great  bodily  harm,  the  issue  in  the
defendant's  case  is  whether  a  person  who  lacks  such  intent  can  be
convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Although voluntary manslaughter
requires  such  intent,  murder  does  not.  In  D,  the  defendant  was
convicted of murder after bringing about the death of another person
without the intent to kill or inflict injury. The affirmance of her murder
conviction  established  that  the  trial  court  was  correct  in  refusing  to
charge  on  voluntary  manslaughter  where  the  defendant  lacked  the
intent to kill. Since this has a direct bearing on whether the defendant
(who  also  lacked  the  intent  to  kill)  can  be  convicted  of  voluntary
manslaughter, D is applicable to the defendant's case.

The  effect  of  A  is  to  hold  that  one  who  acts  unreasonably  may  be
guilty  of  involuntary  manslaughter.  Since  it  does  not  say  anything
about  what  it  would  take  to  justify  a  conviction  for  voluntary
manslaughter,  it  is  inapplicable  to  the  defendant's  case,  and  A  is
therefore incorrect. Since the defendant in B had the intent to kill and
the defendant in the question scenario did not, the decision in B that
the  court  should  have  charged  on  voluntary  manslaughter  is
inapplicable  to  the  defendant's  case.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Like
voluntary manslaughter, attempted murder requires the specific intent
to  cause  death  or  great  bodily  harm.  For  this  reason,  C  appears  at

1257

first glance to raise an issue similar to that raised in the defendant's
case.  Since  the  crimes  charged  in  the  two  cases  were  different,
however, C is not really applicable as a precedent in the defendant's
case.  (That  is,  a  holding  that  the  defendant  cannot  be  guilty  of
attempted murder without specific intent does not logically relate to
the  question  of  whether  a  defendant  can  be  guilty  of  voluntary
manslaughter without specific intent.) C is therefore incorrect.

99. C People have joint authority over a place when there is mutual use of
the  property  by  persons  generally  having  joint  access  or  control  for
most purposes. Here, the girlfriend stated that she shared the bedroom
with  the  defendant  “most  of  the  time.”  Consequently,  she  had  joint
authority over the bedroom and could give valid consent to search it.
A is incorrect because “most of the time” does not lessen the fact that
she appears to have joint access or control for most purposes. In fact,
“most  of  the  time”  could  mean  99.9  percent  of  the  time  because  the
girlfriend  did  not  limit  her  statement  in  any  way.  B  is  incorrect
because  she  does  not  need  to  be  the  owner  of  the  property  to  give
valid consent, as long as she actually has or is reasonably believed by
the  police  to  have  joint  authority  over  the  premises.  D  is  incorrect
because the girlfriend's statement made it clear she had joint authority
over  the  premises.  There  is  no  indication  in  the  question  that  the
police made any kind of mistake regarding her ability to consent to a
search,  so  the  police  would  not  have  to  argue  that  they  were
reasonable in their belief regarding the girlfriend's ability to consent.

100. A Contracts are sometimes subject to a condition precedent. A condition
precedent  is  any  event,  other  than  a  lapse  of  time,  that  must  occur
before  performance  under  the  contract  is  due.  Importantly,  strict
compliance with an express condition is ordinarily necessary. Here,
since  the  buyer  could  not  find  adequate  financing,  he  is  discharged
from  any  of  his  obligations  under  the  sales  contract.  B  is  incorrect
because even if the seller helped subsidize the interest payments, the
express  condition  precedent  still  failed  to  occur.  C  is  incorrect
because  the  failure  of  the  express  condition  precedent  meant  no
contract  was  formed.  Finally,  D  is  incorrect  because  there  was  no
contract until the condition was fulfilled, so the seller could not suffer
any damages under it.

ANSWERS
____________________
PRACTICE MBE — P.M. EXAM
101.  A  A  person  who  renders  a  measurable  benefit  to  another,  with  the
reasonable  expectation  of  payment  and  not  as  an  officious
intermeddler,  may  be  entitled  to  recovery  on  a  theory  of  quasi-
contract  (i.e.,  restitution  for  unjust  enrichment).  (Note:  Since  the
neighbor  did  not  request  the  plaintiff's  performance,  and  since  the
neighbor did not become aware of it until after it had occurred, it is
not at all certain that a court would find in favor of the plaintiff on this
theory. But since the question calls for the assumption that the plaintiff
would be successful in his claim, it is necessary to consider the relief
to which he would be entitled if successful.) Ordinarily, recovery on
this theory is based on the benefit received by the person from whom
payment  is  sought.  This  benefit  may  be  measured  in  terms  of  net
enrichment  or  cost  avoided.  If  these  amounts  are  unequal,  the  court
will usually award the lower of the two. In this case, the neighbor's
net enrichment is the increase in his realty's value — $2,100. The cost
avoided is what he would have had to pay another for the job (i.e., the
standard  market  price)  —  $2,750.  Since  the  net  enrichment  is  the
lesser of these two figures, the plaintiff would be entitled to receive
$2,100.

B and C are incorrect because the benefit received by the neighbor is
unrelated  to  the  plaintiff's  agreement  with  the  homeowner  or  to  the
plaintiff's cost. D  is  incorrect  because  it  exceeds  the  net  enrichment
that the neighbor received.

102.  C  Article  III  of  the  United  States  Constitution  vests  federal  judicial
power in the United States Supreme Court and in such inferior federal
courts  as  Congress  shall  establish.  In  addition,  by  specifying  what
cases they may hear, Article III establishes limits on the jurisdiction
that may be exercised by the federal courts. Although it gives federal
courts  the  power  (i.e.,  jurisdiction)  to  hear  controversies  between
citizens  of  different  states,  or  between  citizens  of  the  same  state
claiming lands under grants of different states, it does not give the

1259

federal courts any power to hear contract disputes between residents
of the same state. Since the United States Constitution is the supreme
law  of  the  land,  neither  Congress  nor  a  state  legislature  can  confer
this power on the United States district courts.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  The  Eleventh  Amendment  only
prohibits the federal courts from hearing certain claims against a state
and  is  inapplicable  because  the  plaintiff's  claim  is  not  against  the
state. D is therefore incorrect.

103. D  A  misrepresentation  is  a  false  assertion  of  material  fact  intended  to
induce  the  plaintiff's  reliance.  A  defendant  intends  to  induce  the
plaintiff's reliance if he or she knows with substantial certainty that a
class of persons to which the plaintiff belongs will rely on his or her
statement. If the reporter did not know that any person would rely on
her  statement,  she  could  not  have  intended  to  induce  any  person's
reliance. Her statement would therefore not be a misrepresentation.

In addition, misrepresentation liability cannot be imposed unless the
plaintiff  was  justified  in  relying  (i.e.,  the  reasonable  person  in  the
plaintiff's  situation  would  have  relied)  on  the  defendant's  false
statement.  Since  the  reasonable  person  might  believe  a  newspaper
account instead of personally checking public records, however, A is
incorrect. B is incorrect for two reasons: First, an expert's statement
of opinion may be a misrepresentation because it asserts as a fact that
the  expert  actually  holds  that  opinion,  and  second,  the  reporter's
statement that “Insiders say . . . (etc.)” is an assertion of fact on which
misrepresentation  liability  could  be  based.  In  actions  for  negligent
misrepresentation,  it  is  frequently  held  that,  without  privity,  the
defendant owes the plaintiff no duty of reasonable care. In this case,
however,  since  the  reporter  knew  that  there  was  no  basis  for  her
statement,  her  misrepresentation  was  intentional.  C  is  incorrect
because  privity  is  not  a  prerequisite  to  liability  for  intentional
misrepresentation.

104. D One who inherits an interest in realty takes it subject to any existing
prior interests. Since the landowner's accountant and brother received
interests prior to the death of the landowner, and since both of those
interests  were  immediately  recorded,  the  landowner's  nephew  and
niece  took  their  interests  in  the  realty  subject  to  those  of  the
accountant and the brother. Thus, the accountant is entitled to succeed
in a foreclosure proceeding. Because of the constitutional requirement

1260

of due process, however, persons who may be deprived of property
as  the  result  of  a  judicial  proceeding  must  be  given  notice  of  an
opportunity  to  be  heard  in  that  proceeding.  For  this  reason,  all
persons  with  existing  present  or  future  interests  in  the  realty  are
necessary parties who must be served with process in a foreclosure
proceeding. Deciding who must be served thus requires nothing more
than determining who holds a property interest — present or future —
in  the  realty.  Since  the  landowner's  nephew  is  the  holder  of  a  life
estate (i.e.,  has  a  present  interest),  and  the  landowner's  niece  is  the
holder of a remainder (i.e., has a future interest), both are necessary
parties. Since neither has been served or brought into the proceeding,
the accountant's request for a foreclosure sale must be denied.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

105.  A  Murder  is  the  unlawful  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought. Malice aforethought consists of a wanton disregard for
human life, or of the intent to kill, inflict great bodily harm, resist a
lawful  arrest,  escape  from  custody,  or  commit  a  dangerous  felony.
Because  it  was  very  likely  to  lead  to  death  or  serious  injury,  the
defendant's firing slightly to the right of the victim probably showed a
wanton disregard for human life. This is particularly so in view of the
fact that the defendant had never fired a rifle before, and therefore he
could not have been sure that he would miss the victim. Thus, since
the defendant caused the unjustified killing of the victim with malice
aforethought,  he  could  properly  be  convicted  of  murder.  While  it  is
not certain that he would be convicted, murder is the only crime listed
of which he could possibly be properly convicted.

Voluntary  manslaughter  is  the  intentional  killing  of  a  human  being
under mitigating circumstances. Since the defendant did not intend to
hit  the  victim  with  the  bullet,  he  cannot  be  guilty  of  voluntary
manslaughter.  Thus,  B  is  incorrect.  A  person  is  guilty  of  a  criminal
attempt when, with the intent of bringing about a criminally prohibited
result,  he  comes  largely  close  to  achieving  that  result.  Thus,  while
murder does not require the intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm,
attempted  murder  does.  The  defendant  did  not  intend  to  inflict  harm
upon the victim, so he cannot be guilty of attempted murder. Thus, C
is  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  knowledge  that  the  location  is
within  the  municipal  limits  is  an  essential  element  of  guilt,  and  the
defendant did not know the dump was within these limits.

1261

106. C The fact that a witness has made prior statements that are inconsistent
with her testimony suggests that her testimony is not worthy of belief.
For  this  reason,  such  statements  are  admissible  for  purposes  of
impeachment.  In  general,  substantive  evidence  is  admissible  if  it
tends to establish a fact in issue. Since the color of the traffic light is
material  to  the  determination  of  the  plaintiff's  rights  against  the
defendant (i.e., is a fact in issue), the deposition in which the witness
said  that  the  light  was  green  for  the  plaintiff  is  relevant  evidence.
Hearsay is ordinarily defined as an out-of-court statement offered to
prove  the  truth  of  the  matter  that  it  asserts.  FRE  801(d)(1)(A)
specifically provides, however, that a deposition given under oath is
not hearsay so long as the person who gave it is available for cross-
examination. Thus, the witness's deposition is not hearsay although it
was  made  out  of  court  and  is  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  a  matter
asserted  in  it.  For  this  reason,  it  is  admissible  as  substantive
evidence. A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

107.  C  Under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  4(k)(1)(B),  “serving  a  summons  or  filing  a
waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant
. . . who is a party joined under Rule 14 or 19 and is served within a
judicial district of the United States and not more than 100 miles from
where  the  summons  was  issued.”  Here,  the  chef  is  impleading  the
waiter under Fed. R. Civ. P. 14(a)(1), since the waiter may be liable
to the chef for all or part of the professor's claim. Consequently, since
the waiter lives within 100 miles of the court where the summons was
issued, the federal district court in State A has personal jurisdiction
over her.

A is incorrect because of the 100-mile rule stated above. B and D are
incorrect because the amount in controversy and the citizenship of the
parties  is  irrelevant  to  the  question  of  whether  the  federal  district
court in State A would have personal jurisdiction over the parties.

108. B The Thirteenth Amendment provides that, except as a punishment for
crime,  “Neither  slavery  nor  involuntary  servitude  .  .  .  shall  exist
within the United States,” and grants Congress the power to enforce
that  provision.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  the
prohibition against slavery was directed at individuals as well as at
government action. This, the Court stated, gives Congress the power
to  define  badges  of  servitude  and  to  eliminate  them  by  enacting
legislation  regulating  private  conduct.  The  Court  further  ruled  that

1262

racial discrimination could constitute a badge of slavery.

individual  rights.  Since 

The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  has  been  held  to
the  Fifth
protect  certain  substantive 
Amendment  protects  only  against  action  by  the  federal  government,
however, it could not justify the regulation of private conduct. Thus,
A  is  incorrect.  Since  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits  only
invidious discrimination by states, C is incorrect for the same reason.
The Fifteenth Amendment provides that the right to vote shall not be
denied  on  account  of  race  or  previous  condition  of  servitude.  Since
the legislation in question does not protect the right to vote, it cannot
be justified by the Fifteenth Amendment. D is therefore incorrect.

109. D A contract may make the happening of a particular event a condition
precedent to the performance of a contractual duty. If so, one party's
strict  compliance  with  the  condition  makes  the  other  party's
conditional  duty  absolute.  The  terms  of  the  commission  agreement
made the broker's delivery prior to April 15 of a buyer ready, willing,
and  able  to  pay  $50,000  for  the  realty  a  condition  precedent  to  the
seller's duty to pay a commission. Since the broker complied with that
condition by presenting the buyer's offer on April 14, the seller's duty
to pay has become absolute.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  commission  agreement  did  not  make
completion of the sale a condition precedent to the seller's obligation
to pay a commission. If an agreement specifies its own duration, then
the  obligations  that  it  creates  are  understood  to  exist  for  the  period
specified.  The  commission  agreement  required  the  broker  to  make
reasonable  efforts  to  sell  the  realty  until  April  15  and  required  the
seller to pay a commission if the broker procured a buyer prior to that
date.  Those  obligations,  therefore,  continued  to  exist  until  April  15.
The seller's rejection of the buyer's offer of April 10 terminated the
buyer's offer but did not affect the obligations created by the seller's
contract  with  the  broker.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  Statute  of
Frauds  simply  provides  that  certain  agreements  are  unenforceable
over objection unless they are in writing and signed by the party to be
charged. The Statute of Frauds would thus prevent the enforcement of
any  contract  that  is  claimed  to  have  been  formed  as  a  result  of  the
buyer's  April  10  offer.  C  is  incorrect  for  this  reason  and  because
while the Statute of Frauds may prevent an alleged oral contract from
being  enforced,  it  does  not  have  any  effect  on  the  validity  of  the

1263

rejection of an offer.

110. B  There  are  only  three  potential  bases  of  liability  in  a  tort  action  —
intent, negligence, and liability without fault (i.e., strict liability). It is
clear from the facts that the defendant's entry onto the plaintiff's realty
was  not  intentional.  Operating  an  automobile  is  not  one  of  the
activities  for  which  strict  liability  is  imposed.  The  only  possible
basis of liability is therefore negligence. Thus, the defendant can be
liable only if she was negligent. Here, she was negligent because she
was driving 15 miles per hour above the speed limit.

A  is  incorrect  because  an  unauthorized  entry  onto  realty  is  not  a
trespass unless it is intentional. The doctrine of “last clear chance” is
practically  obsolete,  but  where  it  is  applicable,  its  only  effect  is  to
relieve a plaintiff of the consequences of his or her own contributory
negligence. Since the defendant is not the plaintiff, whether or not she
had  the  “last  clear  chance”  to  avoid  an  accident  is  irrelevant.  C  is
therefore incorrect. The privilege of necessity permits the reasonable
violation  of  property  rights  in  the  face  of  an  emergency.  D  is
incorrect, however, for two reasons: First, necessity is available only
as  a  defense  to  intentional  tort,  and  second  —  even  under  the
privilege  of  necessity  —  one  who  invades  the  property  rights  of
another  to  protect  his  or  her  own  interests  must  pay  for  any  actual
damage that results from that invasion.

111. D  It  is  generally  understood  that  even  while  testifying,  a  witness  may
look at any document (in fact, at anything at all) that serves to refresh
his  or  her  recollection  about  the  matters  to  which  he  or  she  is
testifying.  Although  there  are  dangers  connected  with  this  rule,  it  is
thought  that  these  can  be  averted  by  investing  the  judge  with
discretion to determine, while listening to the testimony, whether the
witness's recollection has really been refreshed by consulting such a
document, or whether the witness has no real present recollection but
is  simply  reading  from  the  document.  Since  the  plaintiff  had  not  yet
looked at  the  notes  or  stated  that  looking  at  them  would  refresh  her
recollection,  the  judge  is  not  yet  in  a  position  to  exercise  this
discretion and must overrule the objection.

A  is  incorrect  because  any  material  may  be  used  to  refresh  the
recollection of a witness, without regard to the origin of that material.
B is incorrect because even material that has not been admitted or is
not  capable  of  being  admitted  may  be  used  to  refresh  a  witness's

1264

recollection.  A  leading  question  is  one  that  suggests  a  particular
answer.  C  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  there  are  occasions
when a direct examiner is permitted to stimulate a witness's memory
through the use of leading questions, and second, since the attorney's
question did not suggest a particular answer, it was not leading.

112.  C  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  constitutional
requirements  of  equality  in  the  electoral  process  prohibit  the  use  of
property ownership as a qualification for voter eligibility in general
elections. An exception to this rule has been recognized for special-
purpose  elections  on  matters  that  relate  only  to  the  interests  of
landowners.  The  election  in  question  does  not  fit  this  exception,
however, since municipal revenues and their source are of interest to
all residents of the municipality. For this reason, the land ownership
requirement probably makes the special election invalid.

The  Fifteenth  Amendment  only  prohibits  exclusion  of  persons  from
the  electoral  process  on  the  basis  of  race,  color,  or  previous
condition of servitude. A  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication
that any persons will be excluded from voting in the special election
on this basis. B is incorrect because the United States Supreme Court
has held that states can constitutionally limit the vote to residents and
has specifically upheld residence requirements of up to 50 days, and
because persons owning land within the township are not necessarily
residents of the township. D is incorrect for two reasons: First, unlike
the  election  of  representatives,  which  may  be  conducted  by  district,
this is an election that could not be conducted in any other way but at-
large,  and  second,  in  the  absence  of  a  specific  intent  to  dilute  the
power of a particular interest group, at-large elections are valid even
if they have that effect.

113. D  Upon  breach  by  a  buyer,  UCC  §2-706  provides  that  the  seller  may
resell  the  goods  in  a  commercially  reasonable  manner  and  recover
damages equivalent to the difference between the contract price and
the price that the seller actually received upon the resale. Here, since
the plaintiff resold the chairs at the same price that she had agreed to
accept from the defendant, she has sustained no damage at all. (Note:
If the plaintiff incurred extra expense in making 75 individual sales of
one chair each, rather than a single sale of 75 chairs as agreed by the
defendant,  recovery  for  the  extra  expense  might  be  available  as
incidental damages. D  is  correct,  however,  because  the  facts  do  not

1265

indicate that any extra expense was actually incurred, and because no
other  answer  listed  correctly  describes  damages  that  might  be
available.)

Where  the  goods  that  a  breaching  buyer  contracted  to  buy  are  in
unlimited supply, the seller may be entitled to recover the profit that
the seller would have realized if not for the breach. Since there were
a limited number of chairs, however, and since the plaintiff succeeded
in  selling  them  all,  she  is  not  entitled  to  this  remedy.  A  is  therefore
incorrect. B  is  incorrect  because  the  defendant  did  not  agree  to  pay
$100  per  chair,  and  C  is  incorrect  because  when  the  seller  resells
under  UCC  §2-706,  the  damages  are  measured  by  the  difference
between the contract price and the price that she actually received.

114. A Generally it is the judge's function to decide whether offered evidence
may  be  considered  by  the  jury  (i.e.,  is  admissible),  and  the  jury's
function to decide what weight to give evidence that the judge decides
they  may  consider.  To  find  them  admissible,  a  judge  must  determine
whether  photographs  offered  into  evidence  have  been  properly
authenticated.  A  party  seeking  to  authenticate  a  photograph  must
establish that the photograph is an accurate representation of what it
purports  to  picture.  The  plaintiff  has  authenticated  his  photo  by
testifying that he took it of the stove in question and that it accurately
represents  the  stove.  The  employee  has  authenticated  his  photo  by
testifying  that  it  accurately  represents  the  stove  in  question.  Both
photos  have  thus  been  sufficiently  authenticated  to  be  admitted  into
evidence.  It  will  then  be  the  jury's  job  to  decide  which  witness  it
believes — if any — and which photo it therefore believes to be an
accurate representation of the stove in question.

B is incorrect because the employee's testimony that his photo fairly
and  accurately  represents  the  stove  sufficiently  authenticates  it  even
though  he  was  not  the  photographer.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
plaintiff's  testimony  that  he  took  the  snapshot  and  that  it  accurately
represents the stove sufficiently authenticates it. D is incorrect for a
combination of the reasons that make B and C incorrect.

115.  B  Restraints  on  the  alienation  of  leasehold  interests  are  generally
regarded  as  valid  but  are  strictly  construed.  For  this  reason,  a
restraint  against  assignment  is  held  not  to  prohibit  sublease.
Assignment of a lease takes place when a lessee transfers to another
his or her entire remaining interest in the premises. If any interest less

1266

than  this  is  transferred,  the  transfer  is  a  sublease  rather  than  an
assignment.  Since  the  attorney  retained  a  right  to  one  of  the  offices,
his transfer to the second attorney was not an assignment and did not
breach the lease provision prohibiting assignments.

A  is  incorrect  because  if  a  transfer  of  the  lessee's  entire  remaining
interest occurs, the transfer is an assignment even though the terms in
the agreement between assignor and assignee are not identical to the
terms  in  the  agreement  between  the  landlord  and  assignor.  Although
courts generally disfavor restraints on the alienation of fee interests in
realty, C  is  incorrect  because  clauses  prohibiting  the  assignment  of
leasehold  interests  are  generally  regarded  as  valid.  The  financial
status  of  a  prospective  tenant  is  only  one  of  the  factors  which  a
landlord  considers  in  deciding  whether  to  rent  to  him  or  her.  (For
example,  a  landlord  might  be  unwilling  to  rent  to  a  person  with  a
good  credit  rating  if  that  person  has  a  history  of  damaging  leased
premises or engages in an occupation inconsistent with other uses of
the premises.) D is therefore incorrect.

116. B  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  because  defamation
liability can be imposed only for a false statement, and because there
is  no  such  thing  as  a  false  opinion,  defamation  liability  cannot  be
imposed  for  an  assertion  of  opinion.  The  Supreme  Court  also  ruled
that a statement is an assertion of opinion if reasonable readers would
recognize that it was an expression of the writer's feelings and would
not  believe  that  it  was  intended  to  assert  a  fact.  Thus,  if  reasonable
readers would not believe that the statement asserted a fact, it was an
expression  of  opinion  and  therefore  not  subject  to  defamation
liability.

Although  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  a  public  person  suing  for
defamation  must  prove  actual  malice  (i.e.,  knowledge  of  falsity  or
reckless  disregard  for  truth),  this  requirement  has  not  been  imposed
on private persons. For this reason, the defendant could be liable for
publishing  a  defamatory  statement  about  the  plaintiff  that  he
negligently believed to be true, even if he did not have actual malice
when he made it. A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  statement,  even  if  it  is
defamatory,  will  not  subject  its  publisher  to  defamation  liability
unless it is false. But a defamatory statement is said to be false if it is
not substantially true, without regard to whether or not the reasonable
person would believe it. If damage results from the publication of a

1267

statement  found  to  be  defamatory  (which  does  depend  on  what  the
reasonable  person  would  think  it  means)  and  false  (which  does  not
depend at all on what the reasonable person would think), defamation
liability is imposed. Although the amount of damage will probably be
related  to  the  number  of  people  who  believed  the  defamatory
statement  and  held  it  against  the  plaintiff,  it  does  not  depend  on
whether  or  not  those  who  did  so  were  reasonable  people.  The
argument  in  C  would  not  therefore  be  an  effective  defense  for  the
defendant. Although (for reasons stated above) defamation liability is
not  imposed  for  stating  an  opinion,  it  may  be  imposed  for  a  false
assertion of fact even though the maker of that statement believed it to
be  true.  Thus,  if  the  defendant's  statement  was  defamatory,  and  if  it
was a false assertion of fact, the defendant could not escape liability
by  proving  that  he  believed  it  (i.e.,  in  his  opinion  it  was  accurate)
unless his belief was reasonable. D is therefore incorrect.

117. D An illusory promise is a statement that appears to make a promise but
does  not  commit  the  promisor  to  do  anything.  Illusory  promises  are
insufficient consideration to support a contract. Here, the builder has
not bound himself to do anything since he's only agreed to buy bricks
for $1 if he decides to buy bricks. Because the builder's promise did
not actually bind him in any way, it did not provide consideration for
the  brick  supplier's  promise.  Consequently,  the  brick  supplier  could
not be bound to its promise.

A is incorrect because it appears to be referencing the rules for a firm
offer  under  UCC  §  2-205.  Under  that  section,  a  promise  to  keep  an
offer  open  is  enforceable  without  consideration  if  the  promisor  is  a
merchant,  offering  to  buy  or  sell  goods  in  a  signed  writing,  and  the
writing  gives  assurances  that  it  will  be  held  open.  In  that  case,  the
offer is not revocable for lack of consideration during the time stated,
or if no time is stated, for a reasonable time (in no event exceeding
three  months).  Here,  it  doesn't  seem  that  the  supplier  is  giving  any
assurances  regarding  holding  the  offer  open,  the  supplier's  letter
includes no promised time, and the builder made his order six months
later, so the rules regarding a firm offer could not apply. Importantly,
this is not the situation of a requirements contract, as the builder made
no  promise  to  buy  his  required  brick  from  the  brick  supplier.  B  is
incorrect because the letter sent by the builder was not an acceptance.
As stated above, it was an illusory promise. C is  incorrect  because
the reason for the price increase is irrelevant to the analysis.

1268

118. C Since the restriction to residential use was contained in the deed by
which  the  sister  received  her  interest  in  Lot  2,  there  is  no  question
about whether the restriction is enforceable against her. But since her
brother was not a party to the transaction in which the restriction on
his sister's use was created (i.e., the conveyance of Lot 2), a question
exists  about  whether  that  restriction  is  enforceable  by  the  brother.
The  facts  are  unclear  about  who  purchased  first.  (If  the  sister
purchased  before  her  brother,  the  question  would  be  an  easier  one.
Then,  the  benefit  that  the  landowner  received  from  the  restriction  in
his sister's deed probably ran with the landowner's land and probably
passed to the brother with the conveyance of Lot 1. Unfortunately, this
is not one of the options.) Even if the brother purchased first, he may
be able to enforce the restriction in his sister's deed if, at the time of
his purchase, he relied on a representation by the landowner that Lot
2  would  be  similarly  restricted.  In  that  event,  the  brother  might
succeed  on  two  theories:  first,  that  he  was  an  intended  creditor
beneficiary  of  his  sister's  covenant,  and  second,  that  there  were
implied  reciprocal  servitudes.  One  way  of  establishing  reliance  on
such  a  representation  would  be  to  show  that  at  the  time  of  his
purchase,  the  brother  was  aware  that  the  restriction  was  part  of  the
landowner's development scheme. The additional fact in C might thus
result in a decision for the brother.

If  the  brother  purchased  before  his  sister,  the  benefit  that  the
landowner  received  from  the  restriction  in  his  brother's  deed
probably passed to his sister with Lot 2 because that benefit ran with
the land. For this reason, the facts in A and B might be relevant if the
sister was trying to enforce the restriction contained in her brother's
deed.  They  are  irrelevant  to  the  brother's  attempt  to  enforce  the
restriction contained in his sister's deed, however. For this reason, A
and  B  are  incorrect.  If  the  sister  purchased  before  her  brother,  she
might  be  able  to  enforce  the  restriction  in  her  brother's  deed  by
showing that she was aware of the landowner's development scheme
when  he  purchased.  But  since  the  question  involves  the  brother's
attempt to enforce the restriction in his sister's deed, D is incorrect.

119.  A  The  Fifth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United  States
Constitution provide in part that no person shall be deprived of life,
liberty,  or  property  without  due  process  of  law.  Since  the  plaintiff's
claim is that the agency's decision violated his right to due process,
his claim must fail unless the decision deprived him of life, liberty, or

1269

property.  If  it  did  not,  he  was  not  entitled  to  due  process  in  the
decision-making  process.  Cases  have  held  that  if  a  state  employee's
contract  provides  that  the  state  may  decide  not  to  rehire  him  or  her
without  cause,  the  employee's  expectation  of  being  rehired  is  not  a
sufficient property interest to require due process. Thus, the argument
in  A  would  probably  be  successful.  Even  without  these  cases,
however, A would be the only argument listed that could possibly be
an effective response to the plaintiff's challenge.

Although no person has a right to state employment (i.e., no person is
guaranteed employment by the state), the distinction between right and
privilege 
is  an
“entitlement”  that  is  seen  to  be  a  property  interest.  B  is  therefore
incorrect.  C 
the  hearing  officer  would
presumably  act  properly  in  considering  whatever  evidence  the
plaintiff  might  submit  and  therefore  might  not  come  to  the  same
conclusion  as  the  agency.  D  is  incorrect  because  it  is  based  on  an
over-inclusive  statement;  even  though  the  contract  provided  that  the
decision not to renew could be made without cause, it could still have
been  made  for  a  reason  (e.g.,  based  on  race)  or  in  a  manner
inconsistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  Constitution,  thus  violating
the plaintiff's constitutional rights.

120. A Private nuisance is a tortious interference with the plaintiff's right to
use  and  enjoy  realty,  and  it  may  be  committed  without  any  physical
intrusion onto the realty. Although the county ordinance permitted use
of the airport by certain aircraft, the defendant could still be liable for
private nuisance if he was operating the airport in a manner other than
that  contemplated  by  the  ordinance.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  the
plaintiff  would  recover  on  this  theory,  private  nuisance  is  the  only
theory listed that could possibly result in a judgment in his favor.

It  is  sometimes  held  that  repeated  overflights  for  a  given  period  of
time  result  in  a  prescriptive  aeronautical  easement.  B  is  incorrect,
however,  because  this  conclusion  would  privilege  the  continuing
overflights, thus providing the defendant with a defense to an action
brought  by  the  plaintiff.  The  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States
Constitution  prohibits  the  taking  by  government  of  private  property
for  public  use  without  just  compensation.  If  the  county  ordinance
resulted  in  a  reduction  in  the  value  of  the  plaintiff's  realty,  the  Fifth
Amendment might require that the county pay just compensation to the

1270

plaintiff.  Although  this  right  would  be  enforceable  in  an  inverse
condemnation  proceeding,  C  is  incorrect  because  this  theory  is
available only against an agency of the government. Trespass to land
and  the  variant  known  as  continuing  trespass  require  a  physical  or
tangible  entry  onto  the  realty.  D  is  incorrect  because  noise  is  not
tangible.

121. C  An  “admission”  is  a  statement  by  a  party  offered  against  that  party.
Under the common law, it is admissible as an exception to the hearsay
rule;  under  FRE  801(d)(2),  it  is  not  hearsay.  Since  the  defendant's
statement  to  his  wife  is  offered  against  the  defendant,  it  is  an
admission and therefore admissible.

The marital privilege is designed to protect the confidentiality of the
marital  relationship.  For  this  reason,  it  prevents  either  spouse  from
testifying over objection by the other to a confidential communication
made during the marriage. For the same reason, however, it does not
prevent a stranger to the marriage from testifying to a communication
that  he  or  she  overheard  between  the  spouses.  Thus,  although
communications  made  within  the  marriage  are  presumed  to  be
confidential, A  is  incorrect  because  the  witness  did  not  receive  the
communication within the marriage (i.e., as a marriage partner). B is
incorrect  because  an  admission  is  not  hearsay  under  FRE  801(d)(2)
and it is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under common
law.  Communications  that  advance  a  crime  are  not  protected  by
privilege.  The  defendant's  statement  did  not  advance  a  crime,
however,  because  it  was  about  a  crime  that  had  already  been
committed. The fact that it concerned a crime is not enough to take it
out of the protection of the marital privilege, making D incorrect.

122. D If an action is in federal court based on federal question jurisdiction,
a federal court has discretion to remand the case to state court once
all  the  federal  questions  have  been  resolved  based  on  principles  of
fairness  and  judicial  economy.  See  Carnegie-Mellon  University  v.
Cohill,  484  U.S.  343  (1988).  Here,  considering  the  action  was
originally brought in state court and only state claims remain, it would
be  more  practical  and  fair  to  remand  the  case  to  the  state  court.
Therefore, A and B are incorrect.

C  is  incorrect  because  the  district  court's  discretion  to  remand  the
case  to  state  court  is  not  based  on  the  simple  fact  the  case  was
originally brought in state court.

1271

123. B A basic principle of the law of evidence is that only evidence that is
relevant to a material issue may be received in evidence. Evidence is
logically relevant to a material issue if it has any tendency to prove or
disprove a fact of consequence. Since the defendant is charged with
assaulting the victim, not the witness, his beating of the witness could
not  tend  to  prove  or  disprove  a  fact  of  consequence  in  the
prosecution.  (It  might  seem  logical  to  argue  that  the  witness's
testimony  tends  to  establish  that  the  defendant  is  the  kind  of  person
who is likely to have committed the crime with which he is charged.
All  jurisdictions  agree,  however,  that  evidence  of  a  defendant's
character  is  not  admissible  to  create  the  inference  that  he  or  she
engaged in particular conduct on a particular occasion.)

In  some  jurisdictions,  confidential  marital  communications  are
privileged  and  cannot  be  revealed  —  even  after  the  marriage  has
terminated — over the objection of the spouse against whom they are
offered.  There  is  some  disagreement  about  whether  this  privilege
applies  to  acts  as  well  as  communications.  It  is  generally  agreed,
however, that communications or acts are privileged only if they were
intended to be confidential. The fact that the acts to which the witness
testified  occurred  in  public  places  indicates  that  they  were  not
intended  to  be  confidential,  and  the  privilege  therefore  does  not
apply. A is incorrect for this reason and because, as explained above,
the  testimony  may  be  excluded  even  if  the  jurisdiction  did  not
recognize  the  marital  privilege.  The  credibility  of  a  witness  may  be
impeached by evidence relating to his or her reputation for truth and
veracity. C is incorrect, however, for two reasons: First, the witness's
testimony does not logically relate to the defendant's reputation at all,
and second, FRE 608(b) specifically provides that extrinsic evidence
(except  for  convictions)  of  specific  conduct  may  not  be  used  to
impeach  the  credibility  of  a  witness.  Although  a  defendant  who
testifies  in  his  or  her  own  behalf  may  be  impeached  by  cross-
examination (i.e.,  intrinsically)  regarding  past  conduct,  FRE  608(b)
prevents the use of extrinsic evidence of specific acts of unconvicted
bad conduct. D is therefore incorrect.

124. C  Under  the  doctrine  of  impossibility  of  performance,  a  party  may  be
excused from obligations under a contract if an unforeseeable change
in  circumstances  has  made  performance  vitally  different  than  that
which  was  contemplated  by  the  parties  at  the  time  the  contract  was
formed.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  change  that  occurred  was

1272

foreseeable, the fact that it increases a party's burden of performance
is  not  in  itself  sufficient  to  excuse  that  performance.  Because
contracts  must  remain  stable  even  when  the  market  does  not,  it  is
generally  understood  that,  for  this  purpose,  fluctuations  in  market
price are foreseeable. In any event, if dramatic fluctuation in the price
of chickens was foreseeable, then the increase in market price would
not excuse the defendant's performance.

A  is  incorrect  because  if  the  change  was  foreseeable,  it  does  not
matter  whether  the  parties  actually  knew  that  it  would  occur.  In  an
“aleatory” contract, one party agrees to confer a benefit on the other
upon the happening of a fortuitous event over which neither party has
control (e.g., X agrees to pay Y if Y's roll of the dice comes up 7).
Since the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant was not
conditioned upon the happening of any event over which neither had
control, it was not aleatory. B is therefore incorrect. (Note: Under the
reasoning of option B, all contracts for the future payment of money
would be aleatory and invalid.) D is incorrect for two reasons: First,
the  rights  of  the  parties  would  be  the  same  under  common  law  as
under  the  UCC,  and  second,  the  transaction  is  deemed  a  sale  by  the
language of the UCC, which defines a sale as a passing of title from
the seller to the buyer for a price.

125.  C  When  an  easement  is  created  by  grant,  the  language  of  the  grant
determines the scope of the easement. When that language is unclear,
the courts most often determine the scope of the easement on the basis
of  what  could  reasonably  have  been  anticipated  at  the  time  the
easement  was  created.  Although  there  are  insufficient  facts  to
determine whether the argument in C would result in a judgment for
the plaintiff, it is the only argument listed that could possibly support
his position.

If  an  easement  is  created  by  adverse  use  over  a  specified  period  of
time  (i.e.,  by  prescription),  the  use  over  that  period  determines  the
scope of the easement. If the easement is created by grant, however,
its scope is determined by the language of the grant, construed in the
light of what the parties contemplated at the time of its creation. A is
therefore  incorrect.  The  initial  installment  of  a  single  pipe  by  the
defendant might be evidence of what the parties contemplated at the
time the easement was created. It is not conclusive, however, because
the  scope  of  an  easement  is  usually  understood  to  include  those

1273

changes in the activities of the dominant estate that could reasonably
have  been  foreseen.  Thus,  although  the  defendant  installed  only  one
pipe, it may be found that the parties anticipated that the installation
of a second pipe might one day be necessary. If so, that anticipation
would  be  relevant  in  determining  the  scope  of  the  easement  granted
by the language given. B is therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because
where the granting language is not sufficiently specific, the scope of
the easement is determined as explained above.

126. D  Since  the  sales  contract  called  for  delivery  of  marketable  title  to  a
parcel  consisting  of  four  lots,  the  buyer  could  not  be  required  to
accept  anything 
including
easements  —  make  a  title  unmarketable.  Since  one  of  the  four  lots
was  encumbered  by  an  easement,  the  seller  was  unable  to  deliver
marketable title and was, therefore, in breach of contract.

less.  Outstanding  encumbrances  — 

A  covenant  against  encumbrances  is  breached  if  an  encumbrance
exists at the time of conveyance, and it gives rise to an action against
the covenantor for any damage resulting from the existence of such an
encumbrance.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  marketable  title
means a title that can be enjoyed without the likelihood of litigation,
and  title  to  encumbered  realty  is  likely  to  lead  to  litigation.  Since
there may be reasons why the buyer would want to purchase a parcel
consisting  of  four  lots  but  not  a  parcel  consisting  of  three  lots,  he
cannot be required to accept less than what he bargained for. Having
bargained for a parcel consisting of four lots, he cannot therefore be
compelled  to  accept  a  deed  to  only  three  of  them.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. In a tort action for intentional misrepresentation, it would
be  necessary  for  the  buyer  to  show  that  the  seller  knew  that  the
easement  existed  when  he  promised  to  deliver  marketable  title.
Breach of contract liability is not based on fault, however, and may
be imposed simply because the promisor has failed to keep a promise
that he or she made. Since the seller promised to deliver marketable
title (i.e., title free of encumbrances), he may be liable for breaching
that  contract  without  regard  to  whether  he  knew  that  it  would  be
breached when he made it. For this reason, C is incorrect.

127.  A  For  various  reasons,  the  law  recognizes  a  policy  to  encourage
settlements. Since a party might refrain from making a settlement offer
if  he  or  she  believed  that  his  or  her  offer  could  be  used  as
circumstantial evidence of his or her liability, this policy prohibits the

1274

admission as evidence of the offerer's liability of an offer to settle or
compromise a claim.

Since the offerer's explanation for his or her offer would not always
prevent  the  offerer  from  convincing  a  jury  of  his  or  her  liability,
policy would prevent the admission of evidence of the offer even if
the  offerer  was  given  an  opportunity  to  explain  it.  B  is  therefore
incorrect. Although a declaration against pecuniary interest may be an
exception to the hearsay rule, and although the admission of a party is
an exception to the hearsay rule under common law, and not hearsay
at  all  under  FRE  801(d)(2),  C  and  D  are  incorrect  since  the
settlement  offer  is  being  excluded,  not  because  it  is  hearsay,  but
because of the policy to encourage settlements.

128. B The plaintiff in a negligence action must establish that the defendant
breached  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  and  that  the  breach  was  a
proximate  cause  of  damage.  In  concept,  a  plaintiff  has  sustained
damage  as  a  result  of  a  defendant's  act  if  the  plaintiff  would  have
been better off without that act. If the plaintiff otherwise would have
died, then the defendant's act saved the plaintiff's life at the expense
of his injured knees. Since the plaintiff's life was more important (i.e.,
valuable)  than  his  knees,  he  would  not  have  been  better  off  without
the defendant's act and therefore sustained no damage.

Since a result might have several proximate causes, any damage that
the  plaintiff  did  sustain  could  have  been  proximately  caused  by  the
negligence of the defendant and by the negligence of the driver. This
would make the defendant and the driver joint tortfeasors — in most
jurisdictions,  jointly  and  severally  liable  for  the  plaintiff's  damage.
For this reason, the fact that the driver's negligence was a proximate
cause of the plaintiff's injury is not likely to result in a judgment for
the defendant. A is therefore incorrect. If the plaintiff was damaged as
a  proximate  result  of  the  negligence  of  the  defendant,  the  defendant
would be liable for the plaintiff's damage. This is true regardless of
any  injuries  that  the  defendant  might  have  sustained.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.  Ordinarily,  a  person  who  acts  is  required  to  act  as  the
the  same  circumstances.  Since
reasonable  person  would 
emergencies call for quick response without time for cool reflection,
a person confronted with an emergency is not required to act as he or
she would if not confronted by an emergency. He or she is, however,
required  to  act  like  the  reasonable  person  would  if  confronted  with

in 

1275

the same emergency. Thus, the fact that an emergency existed does not
excuse  a  defendant  from  the  obligation  of  acting  reasonably.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

129. D The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that
no person shall for the same offense be placed twice in jeopardy of
life or limb. In general, this prevents a person from being tried twice
for  the  same  crime.  Since  the  defendant  has  already  been  tried,  the
subsequent  prosecution  violates  this  constitutional  protection.  D  is
correct for this reason, and because none of the reasons listed in the
other options is sufficient to result in a denial of her motion.

For  the  protection  against  double  jeopardy  to  be  violated  by
prosecution  for  a  crime,  it  must  be  found  that  the  defendant  has
already been in danger (i.e., jeopardy) of losing his or her liberty as a
result  of  a  prosecution  for  the  same  crime  and  that  the  danger  has
ended.  If  the  danger  to  the  defendant  that  was  created  by  the  first
prosecution  has  ended,  subsequent  prosecution  would  place  her  in
danger  again,  thus  violating  the  Double  Jeopardy  Clause.  A  is
therefore incorrect. It is sometimes argued that a reversal based on a
legal  flaw  in  the  trial  results  in  the  conclusion  that  the  trial  was  a
nullity and that jeopardy therefore never attached in the first place. If
this  were  so,  subsequent  prosecution  would  not  violate  the  Double
Jeopardy  Clause  because  the  defendant  was  never  in  danger  as  a
result of the previous prosecution. B  is  incorrect,  however,  because
the reversal by the appellate court was not based on a legal flaw but
on insufficiency of the evidence that is equivalent to an acquittal after
trial.  Usually  a  convicted  defendant  who  appeals  his  or  her
conviction thereby waives the constitutional protection against double
jeopardy. A reversal based on insufficiency of the evidence, however,
indicates  that  the  initial  trial  should  have  resulted  in  an  acquittal,
which would have barred re-prosecution, and so in such a case, the
defendant does not waive his or her rights under the Double Jeopardy
Clause. C is therefore incorrect.

130. A Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3), a statement prepared by a party “in
anticipation  of  litigation”  is  protected  by  work-product  immunity.
However, since the statement is simply the statement of the head nurse
and does not appear to contain any mental conclusions or impressions
by  the  investigator,  it  is  probably  only  protected  by  qualified
immunity.  In  that  case,  the  man  can  get  the  statement  if  he  shows  he

1276

has  “substantial  need  for  the  materials  .  .  .  and  [he]  cannot,  without
undue  hardship,  obtain  their  substantial  equivalent  by  other  means.”
Since the head nurse related information that was known only to her
regarding  what  happened  during  the  surgery,  the  fact  she  has  died
means  the  man  is  likely  entitled  to  the  information.  Therefore,  C  is
incorrect.

the 

lawyer  and  work  prepared  by 

B is incorrect because work-product immunity applies both to work
prepared  by 
the  party's
“representative  (including  the  other  party's  attorney,  consultant,
surety,  indemnitor,  insurer,  or  agent).”  Consequently,  the  fact  it  was
the  investigator  who  did  the  interview  and  not  the  lawyer  is
irrelevant. D is incorrect because the issue doesn't revolve around the
question of whether the information was obtained by another working
on the attorney's behalf.

131. A Under the parol evidence rule, extrinsic evidence of prior agreements
or  negotiations  is  not  admissible  to  contradict  or  modify  an
unambiguous written contract that the parties intended as a complete
expression  of  their  agreement.  The  rule  does  not  prevent  the  use  of
extrinsic  evidence  for  other  purposes,  however.  Virtually  all
jurisdictions  permit  its  use  to  show  that  the  written  contract  is
ambiguous  and  to  clear  up  the  ambiguity.  Since  the  phrase  “all  fuel
ordered by the state” might mean all the fuel that the state chooses to
order  from  the  plaintiff,  or  all  the  fuel  that  the  state  orders  at  all
during that period, the contract is probably ambiguous on its face. If it
is not ambiguous on its face, the fact that the advertisement calling for
bids indicated that the contract would be exclusive tends to show an
ambiguity since it might mean that the parties intended the plaintiff to
be  the  exclusive  supplier  even  though  the  written  contract  does  not
specifically say so. The advertisement is probably admissible for this
reason.  Although  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this
conclusion, the argument set forth in A is the only one listed that might
provide  the  plaintiff  with  an  effective  response  to  the  state's
objection.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  parol  evidence  rule  may  prevent  the
admission of extrinsic evidence, whether it is oral or written. C and
D  are  incorrect  because  the  parol  evidence  rule  excludes  extrinsic
evidence  of  statements  made  prior  to  and  during  negotiations  if
offered to modify the terms of an unambiguous written contract.

132.  C  At  common  law,  priorities  were  determined  by  the  dates  of  the
transactions  involved.  The  person  who  received  his  or  her  interest
first  had  priority  over  all  others.  In  all  jurisdictions  in  the  United
States, recording statutes have modified the common law rule. Under
the  statute  given  (typical  of  the  “notice”  variety)  an  unrecorded
interest does not defeat the rights of a subsequent taker for value and
without notice. Since the youngest son received the property as a gift
(i.e., did not give value), however, he is not protected by the statute.
For  this  reason,  the  interest  of  the  neighbor,  since  it  was  created
before that of the youngest son, has priority over it. Since the neighbor
did give value for his interest, and since the facts do not indicate that
he was aware of the oldest son's interest, the neighbor is protected by
the recording statute. Under the statute, the oldest son's interest is not
good  against  the  neighbor,  since  the  oldest  son's  deed  was  not
recorded.  Thus,  the  interest  of  the  neighbor  has  priority,  and  the
neighbor is entitled to foreclose.

Although  the  neighbor  did  not  record  his  mortgage,  it  has  priority
over  the  youngest  son's  interest  because  the  youngest  son  —  not
having given value — is not protected by the recording statute. Under
the  statute,  the  interest  of  the  neighbor  —  which  is  protected  by  the
recording statute — has priority over the previously created interest
of  the  oldest  son  because  the  oldest  son's  interest  was  unrecorded
when the neighbor received the mortgage. A is therefore incorrect. B
is incorrect because the youngest son is not protected by the recording
statute  for  the  reasons  given  above.  Since  the  neighbor's  interest  is
superior  to  the  oldest  son's  under  the  recording  statute,  the  oldest
son's  interest  is  subject  to  the  mortgage  held  by  the  neighbor.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

133. A The plaintiff's allegation that the vehicle was defective means that her
claim is based on the theory of strict liability in tort. Assumption of
the risk may be raised as an effective defense to such a claim. Since a
plaintiff  assumes  the  risk  when  he  or  she  voluntarily  encounters  a
danger of which he or she knows, the plaintiff may have assumed the
risk by driving with the knowledge that the seat belt warning indicator
light was not working.

B  is  incorrect  because  a  product  might  be  defective  even  though  it
does  not  violate  a  safety  statute.  If  the  plaintiff  would  have  ignored
the seat belt warning indicator light, its failure to operate was not a

1278

factual  cause  of  her  harm,  and  the  defendant  could  not  be  liable  for
her  injury.  Factual  cause  is  a  question  of  fact  for  the  jury,  however,
and a plaintiff needs to prove it only by a fair preponderance of the
evidence. Thus, even if the plaintiff cannot prove with certainty that
she  would  have  worn  the  seat  belt  had  the  indicator  been  working,
she may still win her case if the jury finds it more likely than not that
she would have. C is therefore incorrect. A professional seller who
supplies  a  defective  product  is  strictly  liable  for  resulting  harm
whether  or  not  the  defect  resulted  from  that  seller's  fault.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

134. A In a foreclosure sale, the proceeds are first used to pay the attorney's
fees and other expenses of the sale, the principal and interest on the
foreclosed  loan,  and  then  any  junior  mortgages  in  the  order  of  their
priority. If there is anything left over, it goes to the mortgagor. On the
other hand, if the proceeds are insufficient to pay the mortgage debt,
the  mortgagee  can  bring  a  personal  action  against  the  mortgagor
unless  such  an  action  is  prohibited  by  state  law.  Here,  A  correctly
states  these  rules.  If  it  is  not  prohibited  by  state  law,  the  third  bank
may  sue  for  a  personal  judgment  against  the  man  to  recover  the
$10,000 it is owed under the third mortgage.

B  is  incorrect  because  junior  mortgage  holders  do  not  split  the
remaining  proceeds.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  junior  mortgage
holders  do  not  have  priority  over  the  foreclosed  mortgage.  D  is
incorrect because the principal and interest on the first mortgage must
be paid before any proceeds can go to other mortgagees.

135. C  An  admission  is  a  declaration  by  a  party  offered  against  that  party.
Under  the  common  law,  admissions  are  admissible  as  exceptions  to
the  hearsay  rule;  under  FRE  801(d)(2),  admissions  are  not  hearsay.
Matters  to  which  a  party  has  stipulated  on  the  record  are  known  as
“judicial admissions” and are conclusive in the proceeding in which
they  were  made.  Since  the  plaintiff  specified  that  the  information
contained in the industry publication was to be used as its response to
the  defendant's  interrogatories,  the  appropriate  portions  of  the
industry publication may be regarded as a judicial admission.

A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect because an admission is either
admissible hearsay (under common law) or not hearsay at all (under
the  FRE).  A  court  may  take  judicial  notice  of  facts  contained  in  a
reference  work  that  is  shown  to  be  a  reputable  source  beyond

1279

reasonable dispute. Since the portions of the industry publication are
admissible  as  admissions,  however,  judicial  notice  is  not  the  only
way that they would be admissible. D is therefore incorrect.

136.  C  Murder  is  the  unlawful  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought. Among other things, malice aforethought may consist of
the intent to cause serious bodily harm or of a reckless disregard for
human life. Stabbing with a knife is evidence of both these states of
mind. Therefore, if the defendant's stabbing of the victim proximately
caused  the  victim's  death,  it  was  probably  murder.  An  act  is  a
proximate  cause  of  death  if  it  was  a  factual  and  legal  cause  of  the
death.  The  defendant's  act  was  a  factual  cause  of  the  victim's  death
because  the  victim's  death  would  not  have  occurred  without  it.
Conduct is a legal cause of death if the death was a foreseeable result
of it, and if there were no superseding intervening causes. The wife's
conduct  was  also  a  cause  of  the  victim's  death,  since  the  victim's
death  would  not  have  occurred  if  the  wife  had  secured  medical
attention. Further, her failure to do so was an intervening cause of the
victim's death because it came after the defendant's act and before the
victim's  death.  If  the  wife's  conduct  was  unforeseeable,  it  can  be
called a superseding intervening cause of death. Under the definition
given above, this would prevent the defendant's conduct from being a
legal (or proximate) cause.

As indicated above, the defendant's conduct was a factual cause of the
victim's  death,  since  the  death  would  not  have  occurred  if  the
defendant  had  not  stabbed  the  victim.  The  wife's  failure  to  secure
prompt  medical  attention  was  also  a  factual  cause  of  the  victim's
death,  since  it  would  not  have  occurred  if  she  had  secured  prompt
medical  attention.  Any  result  may  have  several  causes;  the  fact  that
the wife's conduct was a cause does not establish that the defendant's
was  not.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  If  the  victim's  death  was  an
unforeseeable result of the defendant's act, the defendant's act was not
a proximate cause of it. The term foreseeable, however, means “that
which  the  reasonable  person  would  anticipate.”  Thus,  even  an
unusual  result  may  be  foreseeable.  For  this  reason,  the  fact  that  leg
wounds  do  not  usually  cause  death  does  not  necessarily  justify  the
conclusion that the victim's death was an unforeseeable result of the
defendant's act. B is therefore incorrect. If the wife's conduct was a
substantial  factor  in  producing  the  victim's  death,  it  was  a  factual
cause  of  that  death.  Any  result  may  have  several  proximate  causes,

1280

however. D is incorrect because the defendant's act was also a cause
of the victim's death.

137. C Unless it involves a fundamental right (i.e.,  voting,  or  marriage  and
procreation) or discriminates on the basis of a suspect classification,
state  regulation  of  social  or  economic  interests  is  valid  if  it  has  a
rational  basis.  Since  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that
age is not a suspect classification, the state mandatory retirement law
is valid if it has a rational basis. Under this test, if any state of facts
can be imagined that would make the legislative choice a reasonable
way  to  achieve  a  legitimate  legislative  purpose,  the  law  will  be
upheld.  Since  providing  state  employees  with  the  best  insurance
protection  at  the  lowest  cost  is  a  legitimate  legislative  purpose,  the
mandatory retirement law probably has a rational basis that makes it
valid. (Note: Although it is possible to conclude that the law does not
have  a  rational  basis  because  mandatory  retirement  is  not  a
reasonable  means  of  achieving  this  objective,  C  is  the  only  answer
that could possibly be correct.)

Under the Supremacy Clause, a state law is invalid if it conflicts with
a  valid  federal  law  covering  the  same  subject  matter.  Since  the
federal  law  fixes  the  retirement  age  for  federal  employees,  and  the
state  law  fixes  the  retirement  age  for  state  employees,  the  two  laws
do  not  cover  the  same  subject  matter  and  are  therefore  not
inconsistent  with  each  other.  A  is  thus  incorrect.  A  law  may  have  a
rational  basis  even  though  its  application  to  one  particular  person
does not advance its objective. Thus, if many other state jobs require
skills  or  abilities  that  are  related  to  age,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff's
does  not  will  not  be  sufficient  to  invalidate  the  law.  B  is  therefore
incorrect.  D  is  too  general  a  statement  to  be  correct;  the  federal
government  may  impose  some  economic  burdens  on  the  states  (e.g.,
may tax certain state activities).

138. B If a case is initially not removable to federal court, a defendant has 30
days  to  file  a  notice  of  removal  after  the  case  becomes  removable.
See  28  U.S.C.  §1446(b)(3).  Here,  the  case  became  removable  to
federal  court  once  the  doctor  was  dismissed  because  there  is  now
complete diversity between the plaintiff and defendant and the amount
in  controversy  is  over  $75,000.  Because  the  lawyer  sought  removal
within 30 days, the case can be removed.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  there  is  now  complete  diversity  of

1281

citizenship,  the  lawyer  would  still  need  to  seek  removal  within  30
days of the doctor's dismissal. Consequently, B is a better answer. C
is  incorrect  because  the  lawyer  has  30  days  to  seek  removal.  D  is
incorrect because the fact the banker voluntarily dismissed the doctor
does not change the analysis.

139. B An intervening cause is an event without which the accident would not
have occurred and which took place after the defendant's negligence.
The defendant's encounter with the pothole was, thus, an intervening
cause  of  the  collision.  A  superseding  cause  is  an  unforeseeable
intervening  cause.  In  this  context,  the  word  unforeseeable  may  be
used  to  mean  either  something  that  the  reasonable  person  would  not
have anticipated, or something which, in retrospect, appears to have
been extraordinary. If potholes are frequently found on road surfaces
in  the  area,  the  presence  of  the  pothole  was  foreseeable  (in  either
sense of the word), and could not have been a superseding cause of
harm.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  violation  of  a  statute  may  establish
that  the  defendant  was  negligent,  it  does  not  establish  that  the
defendant's  conduct  was  causally  related  to  the  plaintiff's  injury.  A
superseding  cause  may  relieve  a  defendant  of  liability  by  justifying
the conclusion that his or her conduct was not a legal cause of harm,
whether or not the person responsible for the superseding cause can
be  required  to  compensate  the  plaintiff.  Thus,  the  plaintiff's  liability
does  not  depend  on  whether 
the  Department  of  Highway
Transportation is liable for its negligence or on whether governmental
immunity  has  been  abolished.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  fact  that
the accident would not have occurred without the pothole proves that
the pothole was one of its factual causes. Unless the presence of the
pothole was an unforeseeable intervening cause, however, it was not
a superseding cause of the plaintiff's harm and would not relieve the
plaintiff of liability.

140. D The majority of jurisdictions recognize a client's privilege to prevent
disclosure of a confidential communication that he or she made to his
or her attorney while seeking legal advice even before retaining him
or her. In addition, the privilege applies to confidences that the client
communicates  to  an  agent  of  the  attorney  in  connection  with  the
subject  of  the  attorney-client  relationship.  Since  the  plaintiff's
communication  with  the  witness  was  at  the  attorney's  request  to

1282

enable the attorney to make decisions relative to her representation of
the plaintiff, it is protected by the attorney-client privilege.

A document prepared by or for an attorney that contains the attorney's
mental impressions may be privileged as an attorney's work product.
A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  conversation  between  the
plaintiff and the witness was not a document and did not contain the
attorney's mental impressions. B is incorrect because there is no rule
of  privilege  that  protects  records  kept  in  the  course  of  business
simply  because  of  that  fact.  (Note:  Records  kept  in  the  course  of
business are sometimes admissible under an exception to the hearsay
rule.) An admission is a declaration by a party that is offered against
that  party.  Under  common  law,  admissions  are  admissible  hearsay;
under FRE 801(d)(2), 
admissions are not hearsay at all. Since the defendant seeks to offer
the plaintiff's statements against the plaintiff, they cannot be classified
as inadmissible hearsay. C is therefore incorrect.

141. B Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), the requirements for a class action are
numerosity,  common  questions  of  law  or  fact,  typicality  of  claim  or
defenses, and adequate representation. Here, there are 800 residents
who  are  all  being  forcibly  removed  from  their  homes  by  the  city,
which  is  apparently  doing  so  in  an  effort  to  combat  crime.  The  best
law firm in the city has taken the case, and the two named members
are  longtime  residents  and  business  owners.  Consequently,  it  seems
as if the four requirements are met. Importantly, an injunction can be
the basis of a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) so long as
“the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds
that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or
corresponding  declaratory  relief  is  appropriate  respecting  the  class
as  a  whole.”  Here,  an  injunction  to  stop  the  city's  plans  would  be
appropriate  respecting  the  class  as  a  whole.  Therefore,  C  is
incorrect.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  action  would  be  heard  in  federal  court
based the alleged violation of federal law, not based on diversity of
the parties. D is incorrect because 800 residents are likely too large a
group of people to make joinder feasible.

142. B Generally, if a tortfeasor negligently causes an injury, the tortfeasor is
liable for the full consequences of the injury even though a unique or
rare  medical  condition  causes  the  injury  to  be  much  worse  than  it

1283

would  have  been  for  an  ordinary  person.  Since  the  man's  negligent
flying  of  the  drone  knocked  over  the  woman,  the  fact  her  medical
condition caused blindness when the injury would not have done so in
an ordinary person does not relieve the man from liability. Therefore,
C and D are incorrect.

A is incorrect because the man's failure to register the drone had no
relation to his negligently hitting the woman with it. Negligence per se
only  applies  when  a  violation  of  a  law  leads  to  the  plaintiff  being
injured (i.e., speed limits).

143. B Ordinarily, a relevant object is admissible into evidence if a witness
testifies that he or she recognizes it. Because writings are particularly
subject  to  fraud,  however,  special  rules  have  developed  regarding
their  admission.  Where  the  legal  significance  of  a  writing  depends
upon  its  authorship,  the  writing  cannot  be  admitted  unless  the  court
(i.e., judge) finds that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding
regarding its authorship.

that 

the  court  determines

Unless 
authentication, the jury should not be given an opportunity to see the
document. A  is  therefore  incorrect.  FRE  901(b)(3)  and  the  common
law permit the jury to consider an authenticated exemplar of a party's
signature in determining whether a document in question was signed
by the party. C is incorrect, however, because this is not the only way
of getting the promissory note before the jury. D is incorrect because
once the court determines that there is sufficient evidence to justify a
finding  by  the  jury  regarding  the  genuineness  of  a  signature,  the
question of whether it actually is genuine is one of fact for the jury.

144. B A statute that establishes a system of classification that discriminates
against  members  of  a  particular  ethnic  group  may  violate  the  Equal
Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States
Constitution.  Even  if  a  statute  does  not  establish  such  a  system  of
classification,  however,  it  may  be  enforced  in  a  way  that  makes  it
unconstitutional as applied. In determining whether the application of
a  statute  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  the  United  States
Supreme  Court  has  examined  statistical  evidence  that  the  statute  is
being  enforced  in  a  discriminatory  manner.  Since  the  fact  that  100
percent of the officer's speeding tickets were issued to members of an
ethnic minority constituting only 10 percent of the population suggests
a  discriminatory  application  of  the  speed  limit  statute,  that  fact

1284

furnishes effective support for the plaintiff's assertion.

On  the  other  hand,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  has  received  such
summonses  only  from  the  officer  does  not  indicate  a  discriminatory
application  of  the  statute  by  the  officer  unless  it  is  coupled  with
information  about  other  summonses  issued  by  the  officer.  A  is
incorrect for this reason and because three incidents are probably not
enough to justify any generalization. Coupled with the facts in option
B,  the  facts  in  option  C  might  support  the  conclusion  that
discrimination  was  behind  the  apparent  inequity  in  the  officer's
issuing  of  speeding  tickets.  Standing  alone,  however,  the  fact  that
members of the plaintiff's minority do not drive any differently from
members of other groups does nothing to show that the summons was
issued  to  the  plaintiff  on  a  discriminatory  basis.  C  is  therefore
incorrect. It is, of course, physically impossible for a police officer to
apprehend all violators of a particular statute. This means that some
will be apprehended, while others will not. For this reason, the fact
that one member of a particular ethnic group was apprehended while
some  persons  who  did  not  belong  to  that  ethnic  group  were  not
apprehended is not in itself sufficient to indicate that the apprehension
of  the  plaintiff  was  the  result  of  discrimination.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

145.  A  Criminal  battery  consists  of  the  intentional,  reckless,  or  criminally
negligent application of force to the body of another person. One who
knows  that  he  or  she  often  becomes  intoxicated  upon  drinking  small
quantities  of  alcoholic  beverages  may  be  guilty  of  recklessness  or
criminal negligence by drinking half a glass of beer in the company of
other  people.  Since  this  is  all  the  mens  rea  required  for  a  battery
conviction,  the  fact  that  it  was  the  alcohol  that  made  the  defendant
become  violent  would  not  be  relevant  to  any  material  issue  in  the
case. For this reason, the psychiatrist's testimony should be excluded.

The psychiatrist's testimony had no bearing on the defendant's sanity
under  any  definition  of  that  term  currently  applied  in  the  United
States,  but  it  might  be  admissible  for  some  other  reason.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  criminal  battery  may  be
committed  recklessly  or  criminally  negligently  without  the  intent  to
injure (i.e., criminal battery is a general-intent crime). A defendant's
intoxication  is  involuntary  if  the  intoxicant  was  taken  against  his  or
her will or without knowledge of its intoxicating properties. Since the

1285

defendant  was  aware  that  even  a  small  quantity  of  alcohol  could
intoxicate  him,  he  cannot  be  said  to  have  become  intoxicated
involuntarily. The psychiatrist's testimony would simply confirm what
the defendant already knew about himself when he drank the beer, and
therefore it could not establish that the intoxication was involuntary.
D is therefore incorrect.

146. B  To  be  enforceable,  a  contract  must  be  definite  and  certain  in  all  its
basic terms. One way of determining whether a purported agreement
is sufficiently definite and certain is to ask whether its terms make it
possible  for  a  court  to  fashion  a  remedy  for  its  breach.  Most  of  the
time,  this  requires  that  the  agreement  identify  the  parties  and  show
that they have agreed to the subject matter, the time for performance,
and the price. The writing between the buyer and the seller leaves the
price  to  be  determined  by  a  later  agreement.  But  if  the  parties  have
not agreed as to how that subsequently-to-be-agreed-on price shall be
determined, there is no way that a court could fashion a remedy for its
breach.  The  writing  would  thus  fail  because  it  is  not  sufficiently
definite and certain.

The Statute of Frauds requires that an agreement to transfer an interest
in  real  estate  be  in  writing.  A  writing  might  satisfy  its  requirements
even  though  it  does  not  specify  a  price,  so  long  as  it  indicates  the
method  that  the  parties  have  agreed  to  use  in  setting  the  price.  For
example, if the parties have agreed to set “a reasonable price” in the
future,  the  writing  might  satisfy  the  Statute  of  Frauds  even  though  it
does not specify what the price will be. A is therefore incorrect. C is
incorrect  because  the  parties  did  not  agree  to  be  bound  by  the
objective value of the property, even if it could be determined. D is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  UCC  provision  that  deems  an
omitted  price  term  to  call  for  a  reasonable  price  applies  only  to
transactions in goods, and second, this contract did not omit the price
term  but  provided  that  it  would  be  set  by  mutual  agreement  in  the
future.

147. D A person is guilty of an attempt when, with the intent to bring about a
result  that  is  criminally  prohibited,  he  or  she  commits  some  act  that
brings  him  or  her  substantially  close  to  accomplishing  that  result.  If
the result that the defendant intended is criminally prohibited, and if
the  defendant  came  substantially  close  to  accomplishing  it,  she  is
guilty of attempting it. If an exam answer is “information” as defined

1286

by the statute, its theft would be a crime whether the defendant knew
it or not. Similarly, if she intended to steal it and came substantially
close to doing so, she is guilty of an attempt to violate the statute even
though  she  did  not  know  that  what  she  was  attempting  to  do  was  a
crime.

A person may be guilty of attempting to commit a crime even though
facts unknown to him or her would have made successful completion
of  the  crime  impossible.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  As  a  matter  of
policy, all persons are irrebuttably presumed to know the law. Thus, a
defense  cannot  be  based  on  the  defendant's  ignorance  of  the  statute
that  prohibits  his  or  her  conduct  (i.e.,  ignorance  of  the  law  is  no
excuse). B is therefore incorrect. Since criminal attempt requires the
intent  to  bring  about  a  result  that  is  criminally  prohibited,  a  person
cannot be guilty simply because the result that he or she intended to
achieve was immoral. C is therefore incorrect.

148. B Battery  is  the  intentional  infliction  of  a  harmful  or  offensive  bodily
contact.  However,  consent  is  a  complete  defense  to  battery,  and  a
plaintiff's consent can be implied by the plaintiff's actions. Here, by
taking  part  in  the  soccer  game,  the  plaintiff  impliedly  consented  to
having  the  ball  kicked  away  from  him  (a  common  occurrence  in  the
game). While the defense of consent can be lost if the defendant goes
beyond the consented-to level of contact, the defendant's actions here
do not seem to rise to that level (e.g., if he had punched the plaintiff
or intentionally kicked him directly in the leg). A is incorrect because
assumption of the risk is a defense in negligence actions that generally
applies in clearly dangerous situations where the plaintiff voluntarily
takes  his  or  her  chances  that  a  particular  harm  will  occur  (e.g.,  sky
diving). C is incorrect, because a defendant does not need to intend to
injure the plaintiff, so long as he or she intends to cause a harmful or
offensive  contact.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  contact  here  was  truly
“harmful”  in  that  it  injured  the  plaintiff.  “Offensive  to  a  reasonable
sense of dignity” involves situations where the plaintiff is not actually
harmed by the contact.

149. D  The  right  of  survivorship  is  the  best  known  characteristic  of  a  joint
tenancy.  It  means  that  if  one  of  the  joint  tenants  dies,  the  survivor
becomes the owner of the deceased tenant's share. Thus, if the brother
died while he and his sister were joint tenants, the sister would have
become the sole owner of the realty. When a joint tenant conveys his

1287

or her interest, however, the joint tenancy is severed, and his or her
grantee  becomes  a  tenant  in  common  with  the  remaining  co-owner.
Tenants  in  common  do  not  have  a  right  of  survivorship.  Since  a
quitclaim deed conveys the grantor's interest, the brother's quitclaim
to his wife severed his joint tenancy with his sister and made his wife
and his sister tenants in common. When the sister died, her daughter
inherited the sister's interest, thus becoming a tenant in common with
the wife.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  for  the  reasons  given  above.  C  is  incorrect
because  the  brother's  quitclaim  deed  to  his  wife  severed  the  joint
tenancy.

150. A  Article  IV,  Section  2,  paragraph  2  of  the  United  States  Constitution
contains what is known as the Property Clause: “Congress shall have
power  to  dispose  of  and  make  all  needful  rules  and  regulations
respecting  .  .  .  property  belonging  to  the  United  States.”  The  United
States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  the  Property  Clause  leaves  the
lease or other disposition of federal property within the discretion of
Congress.

Although the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate
interstate commerce, B is incorrect because there is no fact indicating
that the lease of grazing land was for that purpose or would have that
effect. A person has standing to assert a constitutional challenge if he
or she is faced with some actual or immediately threatened concrete
harm that the court could avoid by granting the relief requested. If the
low rate will cause the plaintiff to lose revenue, the plaintiff faces an
immediately  threatened  concrete  harm.  If  the  court  declares  the
federal  lease  unconstitutional,  the  problems  created  by  competition
with  the  federal  government  will  be  solved,  and  the  harm  will  be
averted.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  This  proceeding  challenges  the
constitutionality of the action of Congress and the agency to which it
delegated  power.  The  authority  of  Congress  and  the  federal
government  is  limited  by  the  Constitution.  If  the  federal  government
were immune from such a challenge, constitutional limitations on its
exercise  of  power  would  be  meaningless.  Whether  the  federal
government is immune from tort claims based on allegations of unfair
competition is irrelevant. D is therefore incorrect.

151. A Under the Restatement approach, whether the breeder could rescind
the contract would depend on whether the characteristic on which the

1288

parties were mistaken was a “basic assumption.” Here, the belief of
the  parties  that  the  cow  was  barren,  and  the  huge  price  difference
between a barren and breeding cow, shows that the characteristic was
a basic assumption of the contract. B is incorrect because that answer
choice  only  mentions  the  price  difference,  and  does  not  take  into
account  whether  it  was  a  basic  assumption  of  the  contract.  C  is
incorrect  because  the  mistake  concerned  a  basic  assumption  of  the
contract, not merely the price. D is incorrect for the same reason.

152. C  The  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  provides  in
part that “No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be
a  witness  against  himself.”  The  privilege  only  prohibits  the
government from requiring a testimonial communication, however. It
does  not  protect  a  person  against  being  required  to  participate  in
identification procedures that might lead to his or her conviction. For
this  reason,  the  Fifth  Amendment  privilege  does  not  protect  the
defendant against being required to walk across the courtroom.

required 

to  utter 

A defendant who testifies in his or her own behalf thereby waives the
privilege  and  may  even  be 
testimonial
communications  that  might  tend  to  incriminate  him  or  her.  Since  the
include  non-testimonial
Fifth  Amendment  privilege  does  not 
communications, however, the question of waiver is irrelevant. A is
therefore  incorrect.  A  prosecutor  may  not  comment  on  a  defendant's
assertion  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  privilege;  the  jury  may  not  draw
inferences  from  it.  B  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  Fifth
Amendment does not privilege the defendant to refuse to walk across
the courtroom. Since no penalty can be imposed for the assertion of a
constitutional 
right,  and  since  a  criminal  defendant  has  a
constitutional  right  to  be  present  at  his  or  her  own  trial,  the
defendant's presence in the courtroom cannot be a waiver of any other
right. D is therefore incorrect.

153. A The United States Supreme Court has held that because manipulation
of  circumstances  surrounding  a  lineup  could  create  considerable
likelihood of inaccuracy, and because it would be difficult at trial to
fully  develop  evidence  regarding  such  manipulation,  the  Sixth
Amendment  requires  the  presence  of  counsel  at  a  post-indictment
lineup. For this reason, the defendant's objection would probably be
sustained for the reason given in A.

The constitutional right to confront witnesses requires that a defendant

1289

be given an opportunity to cross-examine such witnesses at a trial. It
does not require, however, that the defendant be given an opportunity
to question those witnesses at any other stage of the proceeding (i.e.,
at a lineup). B is therefore incorrect. The Fifth Amendment protection
against self-incrimination applies only to testimonial communication.
For this reason, it does not prohibit compelling a defendant to show
himself  or  herself  to  witnesses  for  identification  purposes.  C  is
therefore  incorrect.  Since  a  defendant  has  no  constitutional  right  to
refuse to appear in a lineup, police may compel or coerce him or her
to  do  so  by  the  use  or  threat  of  reasonable  force.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

154.  C  A  negligent  defendant  is  liable  for  additional  damage  caused  by
foreseeable rescue efforts. This is true even if these rescue efforts are
negligent in themselves. When faced with a severally injured person,
it is foreseeable that an ambulance driver would drive faster than the
speed limit and negligently crash into a pole. Consequently, the man is
also liable for his friend's death in the ambulance accident.

A is incorrect because a foreseeable rescue does not break the chain
of  liability.  B  is  incorrect  because  it  was  foreseeable  that  the
ambulance  might  drive  negligently  and  crash  into  a  pole.  D  is
incorrect because the simple fact the death happened after the friend's
injuries  would  not  make  the  man  liable  for  the  friend's  death.
Importantly, there is no connection between the accident injuries and
the actual death.

155. B Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, no interest is good unless it must
vest if at all within a period measured by a life or lives in being plus
21  years.  Thus,  a  future  interest  that  might  never  vest  at  all  is  valid
under the Rule so long as the language that created it will prevent it
from vesting after the prescribed period (i.e., if it vests, it will do so
during  the  prescribed  period).  Since  the  church  might  never  cease
using  the  land  for  church  purposes,  and  since,  even  if  it  did,  the
hospital might never cease using the land for hospital purposes, it is
possible  that  the  son's  interest  as  created  by  the  landowner's  deed
will never vest at all. The language of the landowner's deed provides,
however, that in no event is the interest of the son to vest unless the
son is alive when the conditions precedent are satisfied. Thus, since
the interest of the son must vest if at all during a period measured by a
life in being (i.e., the son's life), it does not violate the Rule Against

1290

Perpetuities.

Many  jurisdictions  recognize  an  exception  to  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities  for  the  interest  of  a  charitable  organization  that  follows
the  interest  of  another  charitable  organization.  The  son  is  not  a
charitable organization, however, so this exception would not prevent
the Rule Against Perpetuities from applying to the son's interest. A is
therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities  does  not  require  that  the  interest  in  question  will  vest
during  the  prescribed  period,  but  that  if  it  vests  at  all,  it  will  be
during  that  period.  In  a  jurisdiction  that  does  not  recognize  an
exception  for  the  interest  of  a  charity  that  follows  the  interest  of
another  charity,  the  hospital's  interest  would  be  void  under  the  Rule
Against  Perpetuities.  This  is  because  the  condition  that  would  make
its  interest  vest  (i.e.,  cessation  of  use  for  church  purposes)  might
occur after the period established by the rule. Since the landowner's
deed provides that the interest of the son cannot vest unless it does so
during the life of the son, however, the interest of the son would not
violate the Rule even if the interest of the hospital did. D is therefore
incorrect.

156. D Although the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (applied to
state  action  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment)  prohibits  the  arbitrary
regulation of economic interests, it is almost never used to justify the
conclusion that an economic regulation is unconstitutional. In general,
so  long  as  such  a  regulation  employs  a  means  reasonably  related  to
accomplishing a purpose within the scope of a state's general police
power and does not amount to a “taking,” it will be regarded as valid
under  the  Due  Process  Clause.  Since  regulating  the  storage  of
radioactive  wastes  is  reasonably  related  to  the  legitimate  police
power objective of protecting the public good, and since there is no
indication that Section 40 drastically interferes with the operation of
out-of-state  power  plants,  the  Section  does  not  violate  the  Due
Process Clauses. Although it is not certain that Section 40 would be
declared unconstitutional, due process is the only argument listed that
could not possibly result in such a declaration.

The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV prohibits a state
from  arbitrarily  discriminating  against  out-of-staters.  Since  Section
40  effectively  denies  the  use  of  state  storage  facilities  to  out-of-
staters,  it  might  violate  this  clause.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The

1291

Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment
prohibits  a  state  from  interfering  with  any  of  the  rights  that  go  with
United  States  citizenship.  One  of  these  is  the  right  to  travel  freely
from  state  to  state.  Since  the  Section  effectively  prevents  the
importation  of  radioactive  wastes  from  outside  the  state,  it  may  be
unconstitutional  because  it  interferes  with  this  freedom.  For  this
reason,  B  is  incorrect.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibits
invidious  discrimination  by  a  state.  Since  Section  40  effectively
disqualifies  out-of-state  producers  of  radioactive  waste  from  using
facilities  available  to  in-state  producers,  it  discriminates  against
them.

157. B The United States Supreme Court has upheld a state court's personal
jurisdiction over a defendant when the defendant is personally served
with  process  while  he  or  she  is  within  the  state's  borders.  See
Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604 (1990). This is true even if
the defendant is only in the state for a short time. Therefore, C and D
are incorrect.

A is  incorrect  because  the  fact  the  action  was  filed  in  state  court  in
State  B  would  not  automatically  confer  personal  jurisdiction  over  a
defendant.

158.  D  In  general,  all  evidence  is  admissible  if  it  is  relevant  to  a  fact  of
consequence in the litigation. The fact that there were stolen license
plates on the defendant's van tends to establish that he was attempting
to  avoid  recognition,  and  therefore  that  he  was  planning  to  commit
some crime. Since the burglary statute requires an intent to commit a
crime inside the entered premises, the defendant's plan is relevant to a
fact  of  consequence.  For  this  reason,  evidence  of  the  stolen  license
plates may be admissible in the burglary prosecution.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  It  is  generally  understood  that  evidence  of
unconvicted bad acts by a defendant is inadmissible for the purpose
of establishing that he or she had a criminal disposition. Where such
evidence is offered not merely to prove that defendant had a criminal
disposition,  however,  but  to  establish  an  inference  that  he  or  she
committed the act charged, it may be admissible. Here, evidence that
the  defendant  made  special  preparations  for  a  crime  justifies  the
inference that he entered the warehouse to commit a crime therein. B
is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because evidence of unconvicted

1292

acts  is  inadmissible  for  the  purpose  of  establishing  a  criminal
disposition.

159. A Generally, in the absence of an agreement by the promisee to release
the  promisor  from  his  or  her  obligations  under  a  contract,  the
promisor  continues  to  be  bound  by  his  or  her  promise  even  after
assigning his or her rights. Thus, any rights that the seller had against
the  buyer  under  the  contract  of  sale  survived  the  assignment  by  the
buyer  to  the  attorney.  Even  in  the  absence  of  a  specific  provision
requiring it, a contract for the sale of real property is understood to
impose upon the seller an obligation to deliver marketable title. But
the seller satisfies this obligation if his or her title is marketable at the
time set for performance (i.e., the closing). Since the seller acquired
title  to  the  land  prior  to  the  closing,  he  is  entitled  to  enforce  the
contract of sale against the buyer.

The doctrine of estoppel by deed provides that when a seller acquires
title to realty that he or she has already purported to grant to another
person, he or she acquires it on behalf of that grantee and is estopped
from  denying  the  validity  of  his  or  her  previous  conveyance.  It  is
inapplicable to this case because the seller obtained title to the land
before attempting to convey it to the buyer. B is therefore incorrect. C
is incorrect because the contract did not require the seller to deliver
marketable title until July 15, and on that date he did hold marketable
title. An interest is said to be outside the chain of title if it could not
have been discovered by a reasonable title searcher. Sometimes this
occurs  when  a  person  claims  to  have  received  an  interest  from  a
grantor after a transfer of that same interest by the same grantor had
previously  been  recorded.  (For  example,  O  transfers  to  A.  O  then
transfers  to  B.  B  records  before  A.  A's  interest  may  be  outside  the
chain of title, because a reasonable title searcher finding O's transfer
to B in the record would not look for any subsequent transfers of the
same interest by O.) D is incorrect, however, for two reasons: First,
this argument is normally relevant only in determining the priority of
two  different  interests,  and  second,  there  is  no  indication  that  the
farmer  had  previously  conveyed  the  land  to  another  person  or  that
such a conveyance had been recorded before the farmer's conveyance
to the seller.

160. A An action must be dismissed if the federal court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over the action. For a federal court to have subject
matter jurisdiction over an action, the plaintiff and defendant must be

1293

citizens of different states or the action must arise under federal law.
Here,  the  businessman  is  a  citizen  of  State  A.  A  corporation  is  a
citizen  of  where  it  is  incorporated  and  where  its  principal  place  of
business  is  located.  A  corporation's  principal  place  of  business  is
where  the  corporation's  high-level  officers  control  the  business.
Consequently,  the  company  is  a  citizen  of  State  B,  where  it  is
incorporated,  and  State  A,  where  its  executives  are  based.  Because
both  the  businessman  and  the  company  are  citizens  of  State  A,  the
action should be dismissed.

B is incorrect because the issue presented here is not one regarding
personal  jurisdiction,  and  the  location  of  the  majority  of  the
company's  apartments  does  not  affect  its  citizenship  in  regards  to
determining  subject  matter  jurisdiction.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
appeals  court  would  be  required  to  dismiss  the  action  for  lack  of
subject  matter  jurisdiction  even  if  the  company  did  not  challenge
jurisdiction.  D  is  incorrect  because  federal  question  jurisdiction
cannot be based on a defendant's defense.

161. B Police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only
if  the  arrestee  is  within  reaching  distance  of  the  passenger
compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the
vehicle  contains  evidence  of  the  offense  of  arrest.  When  these
justifications  are  absent,  a  search  of  an  arrestee's  vehicle  will  be
unreasonable  unless  police  obtain  a  warrant  or  show  that  another
exception to the warrant requirement applies. Here, the defendant was
secured  in  the  police  car  at  the  time  of  the  search,  and  there  is
unlikely  to  be  any  evidence  relating  to  his  offense.  While  searches
conducted without prior approval are unlawful, this statement is too
broad because it fails to note the exceptions to this rule. A is therefore
incorrect. C is incorrect because an inventory search is not the only
way  a  police  officer  can  lawfully  discover  evidence  contained  in  a
car. D is incorrect because there is no rule stating that the interior of a
car is always within the immediate control of an arrestee.

162. A Generally, the federal rules only require that a complaint contain “a
short  and  plain  statement  of  the  claim  showing  that  the  pleader  is
entitled to relief.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9,
certain  other  matters,  such  as  fraud,  mistake,  and  special  damages
require  a  party  to  give  more  detail.  Here,  since  the  man  is  simply
making a claim under federal employment law, he does not need to do

1294

more than make a short and plain statement of the claim.

B is incorrect because the relevant analysis requires more than mere
notice. For example, a plaintiff could not simply file a complaint that
stated “I'm suing defendant!” In that case, while the defendant would
certainly  have  notice,  the  defendant  would  know  nothing  about  the
claim. C is incorrect because the salesman does not need to set out a
prima facie case. D is incorrect because “a party may state as many
separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.” See
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3).

163. D A person is guilty of a criminal attempt when, with the specific intent
to  bring  about  a  criminally  prohibited  result,  he  or  she  does  some
significant  act  that  brings  him  or  her  substantially  close  to
accomplishing  that  result.  Thus,  although  a  person  may  be  guilty  of
murder  without  actually  intending  to  bring  about  a  death,  he  or  she
cannot be guilty of attempted murder without the intent to bring about
a death. Since the druggist did not really believe that the wife would
die, he could not have intended to bring about her death and cannot be
guilty of attempting to murder her.

Murder  is  the  unlawful  killing  of  a  human  being  with  malice
aforethought.  Malice  aforethought  includes  a  reckless  disregard  for
human life. If the druggist's conduct showed a reckless disregard for
human life, and if it resulted in the death of the wife, then the druggist
would  be  guilty  of  murder.  A  is  incorrect,  however,  because  no
person can be guilty of attempted murder without the specific intent to
bring about a death or to cause great bodily harm. B is incorrect for
the same reason, and because ordinarily a person is under no duty to
stop  another  from  committing  a  crime.  Since  the  druggist  did  not
believe the drug that he furnished would harm the wife, he lacked the
specific intent necessary to make him guilty of attempting to kill her.
C is therefore incorrect.

164. A  Under  FRE  803(8),  the  file  itself  may  be  admissible  as  an  official
written statement since it was made at or near the time of the matter
recorded  by  a  public  official  regarding  matters  in  the  declarant's
personal  knowledge  in  the  course  of  the  declarant's  duties.  (Note:
The  file  may  also  be  admissible  as  a  business  record.)  Even  if  the
personnel  file's  contents  are  admissible,  however,  the  witness's
testimony about its contents might not be. Under the common law and
FRE  1002,  the  best  evidence  rule  prohibits  secondary  evidence  to

1295

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

prove the terms of a writing unless the writing itself is shown to be
unavailable. Since the purpose of the witness's testimony is to prove
the  contents  of  the  file,  he  will  not  be  permitted  to  do  so  unless  the
file is shown to be unavailable.

If  the  requirements  of  the  best  evidence  rule  are  satisfied,  the
witness's  testimony  would  be  as  admissible  as  the  file  itself.  Since
the  FRE  make  business  records  and  official  written  statements
admissible without regard to the availability of the person who made
entries  in  them,  B  and  C  are  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
official  written  statement  exception,  although  it  is  sometimes  called
the “public document” exception, does not require that the record be
one that is available for public inspection.

165. A  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  something  of  value
(i.e.,  consideration)  was  given  in  return  for  it.  Since  the  plaintiff
paved the driveway before the neighbor promised to pay, he could not
have  done  so  in  return  for  the  promise.  The  paving  job,  therefore,
could not have been consideration for the neighbor's promise. Under
the  view  of  the  Restatement  (2d)  of  Contracts,  however,  a  promise
made in recognition of a benefit previously received by the promisor
from  the  promisee  is  binding  to  the  extent  necessary  to  prevent
injustice.  Thus,  if  the  neighbor  knew  that  the  plaintiff  had  paved  his
driveway and made the promise to pay in recognition of this benefit,
the promise would be enforceable.

B  is  incorrect  because  the  neighbor's  promise  could  not  have  been
given  in  recognition  of  the  paving  job  if  the  neighbor  did  not  know
about it at the time he made the promise. Since the paving job done by
the  plaintiff  was  not  given  in  return  for  the  neighbor's  promise,  it
would  not  be  consideration  for  that  promise  no  matter  when  the
neighbor  decided  to  have  the  job  done.  C  and  D  are  therefore
incorrect.

166. D A landlord's failure to take prompt action when he or she learns of an
attempted assignment or sublease constitutes a waiver of the right to
block  it.  Here,  the  landlord  will  probably  not  be  permitted  to
terminate  the  lease  since  he  likely  waived  his  right  to  do  so  by
accepting rent and failing to take prompt action when he discovered
the assignment. Consequently, A is incorrect. B is incorrect because,
by accepting rent and waiting to protest, the landlord did not appear
to be protesting within a reasonable time. C is incorrect because the

1296

issue  involves  the  landlord's  actions,  not  the  nature  of  the  property
interests.

167. D If a person's behavior is grossly negligent, he or she may be liable for
involuntary manslaughter if his or her conduct results in the death of
another person. Nearly all states hold that the defendant's negligence
must be something more than ordinary negligence. “Gross negligence”
usually  means  the  defendant  disregarded  a  substantial  danger  of
serious  bodily  harm  or  death.  However,  there  must  be  a  causal  link
between the gross negligence and the death. Consequently, if the death
would  have  occurred  even  without  the  defendant's  gross  negligence,
involuntary manslaughter wouldn't apply. Here, the facts state that the
defendant drove the correct speed and obeyed all traffic regulations.
Consequently, his gross negligence, specifically his intoxication, was
not the cause in fact or proximate cause of the man's death. Thus, A is
incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because,  even  though  courts  look  at  the
totality  of  the  circumstances  in  determining  gross  negligence,  the
important  point  is  that  the  defendant's  gross  negligence  was  not  the
cause  of  the  accident.  C  is  incorrect  because,  even  if  a  violation  is
malum  in  se  (dangerous  in  itself),  there  still  needs  to  be  a  causal
relation between the negligence and the death.

168.  A  An  illusory  promise  is  a  statement  which  appears  to  promise
something,  but  in  fact  does  not  commit  the  promisor  to  anything.
Importantly,  such  a  promise  will  not  give  sufficient  consideration  to
support  a  contract.  Here,  there  was  no  consideration  for  the
endorsement because the plaintiff could have sued immediately if he
decided  he  wanted  his  money.  Thus,  he  really  didn't  promise  to  do
anything at all. The fact that the plaintiff in fact did not collect on the
note  for  two  years  is  irrelevant.  Under  promissory  estoppel,  a
promise is binding if “. . . (c) the promisor should reasonably expect
the promise to induce action or forbearance of a substantial character
on  the  part  of  a  promisee  or  a  third  person,  and  the  promise  does
induce such action or forbearance.” Here, a court might find that the
defendant's guarantee should reasonably have been expected to induce
the plaintiff to refrain from suing, that it did have this effect, and that
this  was  of  a  substantial  character.  In  such  an  event,  the  defendant
would have been bound. Based on the facts here, a court could find
that the plaintiff did in fact rely to his detriment on the promise. Thus,
B is incorrect, and A is a stronger answer. C is incorrect because the
fact  that  the  husband  is  the  primary  debtor  does  not  change  the

1297

analysis. Unconscionability arises in situations where an agreement is
grossly  unfair.  Here,  there  is  no  indication  of  any  unfairness  in  the
agreement, so D is incorrect.

169. A Specific performance is a remedy available for breach of a contract
for  the  sale  of  something  unique.  Since  each  parcel  of  realty  is
regarded  as  unique,  specific  performance  is  usually  available  as  a
buyer's remedy for a seller's breach of a contract for the sale of realty.
Unless  such  a  contract  has  been  formed  and  breached,  however,  no
remedy is available at all. A contract is formed by the acceptance of
an  offer.  An  offer  is  an  expression  of  an  unequivocal  willingness  to
enter into a contract with another on specified terms. Since the seller
never indicated a willingness to enter into a contract with the buyer
on  any  particular  terms,  he  never  made  an  offer  to  the  buyer.  The
buyer  twice  made  offers  to  the  seller,  but  the  seller  did  not  accept
either of them. Thus, no contract was ever formed between the seller
and  the  buyer  or  breached  by  the  seller.  The  buyer  is  therefore
without any remedy.

Whether  the  seller's  statement  to  the  broker  on  April  10  was  an
attempt to modify an existing agreement is not at all certain under the
facts regarding that agreement. B is incorrect in any event because the
agreement between the seller and the broker did not require the seller
to accept an offer procured by the broker, and it is not relevant to the
buyer's  rights  against  the  seller.  Specific  performance  is  not  usually
available as a remedy for the breach of a contract for sale unless the
subject of the contract is unique or damages would be an inadequate
remedy.  C  is  incorrect,  however,  because  —  for  the  reasons  given
above  —  there  has  been  no  breach,  and  the  buyer  therefore  has  no
remedy  at  all.  Since  the  seller  made  no  offer  to  the  buyer,  the
document  that  was  presented  to  the  seller  on  April  14  was  nothing
more  than  an  offer.  Since  the  seller  did  not  accept  it,  no  contract
between him and the buyer was formed. D is therefore incorrect.

170.  C  Hearsay  is  defined  as  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  for  the
purpose  of  proving  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  that  statement.
Since the plaintiff's attorney's notes were made out of court, and since
the only apparent reason to offer them is to establish the truth of their
contents, they are hearsay.

FRE  803(6) 
for  properly

authenticated business records recorded as part of the regular course

1298

of business, while the transaction recorded was fresh in the entrant's
mind, regarding facts within the entrant's personal knowledge or from
an  inherently  reliable  source.  Since  the  facts  do  not  indicate  what
information was contained in the attorney's notes, there is no way to
determine whether all the information actually contained in them was
within  the  attorney's  personal  knowledge  or  from  an  inherently
reliable  source.  An  additional  question  exists  as  to  whether  an
attorney's notes regarding a negotiation between a client and another
party are kept in the regular course of business. No matter how these
questions  are  resolved,  however,  the  attorney's  notes  cannot  be
admitted  as  a  business  record  unless  they  are  authenticated  by  a
person  who  testifies  to  the  record's  identity  and  its  mode  of
preparation.  Since  no  one  has  testified  as  such,  A  is  incorrect.
Documents  that  have  been  used  to  refresh  a  witness's  recollection
while  testifying  may  be  consulted  by  an  adverse  party  in  cross-
examining  that  witness.  In  addition,  an  adverse  party  may  introduce
into evidence those portions of the document that are relevant to the
witness's testimony. B  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the  fact  that  a
party  used  a  document  to  refresh  his  or  her  recollection  is  not
sufficient  to  justify  its  introduction  by  the  party  that  used  it.  Under
certain circumstances, an attorney may resist discovery of his or her
own  work  product  and  prevent  it  from  being  received  in  evidence.
This  privilege  belongs  to  the  attorney  (and  his  or  her  client),
however, not to his or her adversary. For this reason, the defendant's
attorney could not successfully object on the ground that the document
was the plaintiff's attorney's work product. D is therefore incorrect.

171. D The Equal Protection Clause prohibits invidious discrimination by the
state,  but  not  all  discrimination  is  invidious.  Ordinarily,  statutory
systems  of  classification  (i.e.,  discrimination)  are  valid  so  long  as
they have a rational basis. If the discrimination is based on a suspect
classification  or  interferes  with  a  fundamental  right,  however,  it  is
presumed  invalid  unless  it  is  proven  to  be  necessary  to  achieve  a
compelling state interest. The Supreme Court has held that the right to
vote  is  a  fundamental  right.  For  this  reason,  the  Township  Council's
assertion that the registration schedule had a rational basis would not
be sufficient to prevent it from being declared unconstitutional.

Discrimination on the basis of lifestyle or wealth has been held not to
involve  a  suspect  classification.  A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.
Some  forms  of  sex  discrimination,  referred  to  as  “benign”  because

1299

they  are  aimed  at  compensating  for  the  demonstrated  economic
disadvantages of women, have been found constitutional. Some forms
of sex discrimination, called “benign” because they are based on old
thought patterns about sex roles and the dependency of women, have

172. C Unless a landlord specifically agrees to release a tenant from further
obligations under a lease, assignment or sublease does not relieve the
original  tenant  from  those  obligations.  For  this  reason,  the  landlord
can collect unpaid rent from the first attorney. Since the landlord was
an intended third-party creditor beneficiary of the agreement between
the attorneys, the landlord can also collect from the second attorney.
A, B, and D are therefore incorrect.

173. C Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(d), a district court can order a new trial on
its  own  for  any  reason  that  would  justify  granting  one  on  a  party's
motion.  Because  inadequate  damages  could  be  the  basis  for  a  new
trial, the trial judge can order a new trial.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  additur,  or  offering  a  defendant  a
choice between a higher damage award or a new trial, had been found
to  be  a  violation  of  the  Seventh  Amendment  (although  this  does  not
apply to state courts). D is incorrect because a motion for judgment as
a matter of law must be made by a party before the case is submitted
to a jury.

174.  A  Unless  the  parties  expressly  agree  otherwise,  the  owner  of  the
servient estate is not required to repair or maintain the property used
in  the  easement.  Here,  there  was  no  express  agreement  regarding
repair  between  the  parties,  so  the  owner  who  granted  the  easement
has no duty to repair the bridge. B is incorrect, because, although the
holder of the easement has an implied right to maintain the property
used in the easement, if the servient estate holder does not enjoy any
of the benefits of the easement, he is under no obligation to reimburse
for  repairs.  Here,  there  is  no  indication  that  the  owner  who  granted
the easement uses the easement. C is incorrect because the owner of
the  servient  estate  has  no  obligation  of  repair,  even  if  the  lack  of
maintenance means that the easement holder cannot use the easement
as the parties intended. D is incorrect because the fact that this was an
express easement does not change the analysis.

1300

175. B State action that imposes a penalty for the exercise of a constitutional
right  is  a  deprivation  of  liberty.  If  the  decision  not  to  renew  the
plaintiff's  contract  was  based  on  his  speech  (an  exercise  of  First
Amendment rights), it interfered with a liberty interest. Since the Fifth
and  Fourteenth  Amendments  protect  against  deprivation  of  liberty
without due process, the additional fact set forth in B could result in a
finding that a hearing (i.e., due process) was required.

A is incorrect because there is no indication that the contracts of the
probationary  employees  who  received  hearings  permitted  non-
renewal  without  cause,  as  did  the  plaintiff's.  C  is  incorrect  because
the United States Supreme Court has specifically held that state action
does  not  require  a  prior  hearing  merely  because  it  interferes  with
reputation, particularly since a tort action for defamation is available
to  prevent  abuse.  Sometimes  urgency  plays  a  role  in  the  court's
decision  about  whether  a  prior  hearing  is  required  for  a  particular
action.  For  example,  it  has  been  held  that  because  the  denial  of
welfare  benefits  could  leave  a  person  in  a  desperate  financial
situation, a prior hearing is required. Similarly, if delaying governing
action until after a hearing is held is likely to result in serious harm to
the government, it might be appropriate to act without holding a prior
hearing.  The  fact  set  forth  in  D  might  justify  the  conclusion  that
keeping the plaintiff on the job until a hearing is held would result in
serious harm to the state. In that case, it would hurt rather than help
the plaintiff's cause.

176. A In jurisdictions that recognize the spousal privilege, a spouse is not
permitted  to  testify  to  a  confidential  communication  received  during
marriage  if  the  spouse  who  made  the  communication  objects  to  the
testimony.  For  this  reason,  the  court  should  exclude  his  wife's
testimony if the defendant objects to it.

In  general,  all  evidence  that  tends  to  establish  a  material  fact  is
relevant and should be admitted unless excluded by some rule of law.
Since  the  defendant's  statement  that  he  committed  the  crimes  he  is
charged with tends to establish that he did so, it is relevant. Hearsay
is  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  matter
asserted in that statement and is inadmissible unless it falls within an
exception to the hearsay rule. A statement by a party offered against
that  party  is  an  admission,  however.  An  admission  is  admissible
under  common  law  as  an  exception  to  the  hearsay  rule  and  is  not

1301

hearsay under FRE 801(d)(2). Thus, the defendant's statement should
be  admitted  unless  excluded  by  the  spousal  privilege.  A  privilege
may only be asserted by one who holds it. In some jurisdictions (and
the FRE follow local state law as to privileges), the spousal privilege
can  be  asserted  only  by  the  spouse  who  made  the  confidential
communication.  In  other  jurisdictions,  the  privilege  may  also  be
asserted  by  the  spouse  who  received  the  communication.  But  all
jurisdictions agree that the communication may be excluded only if a
person  holding  it  objects.  Therefore,  if  neither  spouse  asserts  the
privilege, it cannot be used to exclude the wife's testimony. B, C, and
D are therefore incorrect.

177. A A party's unequivocal statement that he or she will not perform is an
anticipatory  repudiation  and  entitles  the  other  party  to  all  rights
resulting  from  a  breach.  The  plaintiff's  statement  that  she  would  not
accept the coins in payment for the chickens was such a statement. Its
result was to free the defendant from any further obligation under the
contract  and  to  give  the  defendant  a  right  to  an  immediate  action
against the plaintiff for breach of contract.

A  prospective  inability  to  perform  occurs  when  a  party  engages  in
some  conduct  that  divests  that  party  of  the  ability  to  perform.  All
jurisdictions  agree  that  one  party's  prospective  inability  to  perform
excuses  the  other  party's  performance,  and  some  jurisdictions  hold
that  it  gives  him  or  her  an  immediate  right  to  sue.  B  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  defendant's  prospective  inability  to  perform
would not in any jurisdiction give the defendant a right of action. For
the reason stated above, the defendant's refusal to accept delivery of
the  chickens  was  excused  by  the  plaintiff's  anticipatory  repudiation
and  was  therefore  not  a  breach.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  (Note:  C
may  be  confusing  because  of  its  use  of  the  word  impossible.  If  an
unforeseeable  change  in  circumstances  makes  it  impossible  for  a
party  to  perform  his  or  her  obligation  under  a  contract,  his  or  her

impossibility of performance. Since the defendant's refusal to accept
delivery  did  not  result  from  an  unforeseen  change  in  circumstances
but  rather  from  his  decision  to  treat  the  plaintiff's  repudiation  as  an
immediate breach, the doctrine of impossibility of performance is not
relevant  to  this  case.  If  it  were  relevant,  it  would  tend  to  defeat  the
plaintiff's claim, not support it.) Since the defendant chose to treat the
plaintiff's  anticipatory  repudiation  as  an  immediate  breach,  the

1302

plaintiff cannot subsequently undo the breach by offering to perform.
D is therefore incorrect.

178. D A defendant's conduct is not privileged solely by virtue of the fact that
he  or  she  made  a  mistake.  Consequently,  while  the  defendants  may
have  made  a  good  faith  mistake  in  mistaking  the  farmer's  dog  for  a
wolf, they will still be liable for the farmer's damages.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

179. D Expression with a primarily commercial purpose may be regulated so
long  as  the  regulation  directly  advances  a  substantial  government
interest by the least burdensome means necessary. Whether protecting
the  public  against  annoyance  by  computerized  telephone  calls  is  a
substantial  government  interest  and  whether  the  prohibition  against
the  use  of  the  robocall  computer  within  the  state  directly  advances
that interest are two questions open to debate. If the answer to either
question  is  “no,”  then  the  statute  violates  the  First  Amendment.  It  is
far  from  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  this  conclusion,  but  the
argument  set  forth  in  D  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly
support the company's position.

Because  of  the  importance  of  free  expression,  the  rules  of  standing
are  ordinarily  relaxed  for  First  Amendment  challenges  based  on  a
claim  of  overbreadth.  Thus,  a  person  whose  speech  can  be
constitutionally  punished  may  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  a
statute that punishes it on the ground that the statute is “overbroad” in
that  it  also  punishes  speech  that  cannot  be  constitutionally  punished.
The  purpose  of  this  rule  is  to  prevent  the  “chilling”  of  First
Amendment  rights  by  state  regulations.  Since  it  is  believed  that
advertisers  are  unlikely  to  be  chilled  by  such  regulations,  however,
this  rule  does  not  apply  in  commercial  speech  cases.  A  is  therefore
incorrect.  The  selection  of  a  standard  to  be  applied  in  deciding  the
constitutional validity of a law regulating expression may depend on
whether the regulation is content-related. This fact alone, however, is
never sufficient to justify the conclusion that the regulation is invalid.
B is therefore incorrect. A statute is said to have a “chilling” effect on
freedom of expression if its terms are so unclear that the reasonable
person  could  not  tell  what  forms  of  expression  are  prohibited  and
might  therefore  be  afraid  to  engage  in  unprohibited  forms  of
expression.  Although  the  high  cost  of  using  telephone  solicitation
computers  outside  the  state  to  call  numbers  inside  the  state  might

1303

discourage  people  from  doing  so,  this  will  not  be  because  they  are
uncertain about what expression the law forbids. Thus, the law cannot
be said to have a chilling effect for this reason, making C incorrect.

180. A A direct restraint on alienation is a covenant or condition that attempts
to control the alienability of the estate granted. A disabling restraint
purports  to  withhold  the  grantee's  power  to  alienate.  A  promissory
restraint  consists  of  a  covenant  not  to  alienate.  It  does  not  withhold
the  covenantor's  power  to  alienate  but  subjects  the  covenantor  to
liability  for  damages  for  breaching  the  covenant  by  alienating.  A
forfeitural restraint terminates the estate upon an attempt to alienate it,
causing the property to vest in someone else. Direct restraints on the
alienation of fee simple estates are generally void and unenforceable,
whether  they  are  disabling,  promissory,  or  forfeiturial.  While
disabling restraints on the alienation of life estates are similarly void,
promissory  or  forfeiturial  restraints  on  the  alienation  of  life  estates
may be valid if reasonable. From the language of the farmer's will, it
is  difficult  to  determine  whether  the  restraint  that  it  creates  is
disabling or forfeiturial. The argument presented in A is the only one
listed, however, that might possibly support the son's claim.

B and C are incorrect because promissory and forfeiturial restraints
on the alienation of life estates may be enforceable. D is incorrect in
spite of the 40-year period that it specifies, because the son could not
possibly alienate his interest except during his own lifetime. Thus, the
vesting  of  the  daughter's  interest  could  not  possibly  occur  beyond  a
period measured by a life in being (the son's) plus 21 years, making
the Rule Against Perpetuities inapplicable to it.

181. B The “plain view” doctrine allows a police officer to seize evidence
falling  into  the  officer's  “plain  view”  when  that  officer  sees  the
evidence from a place where it is lawful for the officer to be. Here,
by consenting to have the officer in her home, the police officer was
lawfully  in  the  living  room.  However,  the  question  in  such
circumstances  is  what  the  homeowner  would  have  reasonably
believed her consent amounted to. Importantly, if one consents to have
another person in his or her home, that does not mean there is consent
for the person to open things he or she finds in the home. People do
not  expect  casual  guests  to  open  boxes,  dig  through  closets,  etc.
Therefore,  the  plain  view  doctrine  would  not  apply  because  the
homeowner did not give her consent to open the gun case. Therefore,

1304

C is incorrect.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  homeowner  leaving  the  room  did  not
change the analysis. D is incorrect because the police officer simply
saw a gun case. In many instances, guns and gun cases are perfectly
lawful. Here, the police officer did not know about the illegality until
the case was opened.

182. A  Article  I,  Section  10  of  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  the
states  from  passing  laws  impairing  the  obligation  of  contracts.  This
prevents  a  state  from  unjustifiably  repudiating  its  own  contractual
obligations or interfering with the contract rights of individuals. If the
plaintiff  was  a  state  employee  prior  to  the  time  the  mandatory
retirement  law  was  passed,  the  state  owed  him  certain  obligations
under the employment contract. Under the laws that then existed, these
included the obligations to grant an annual salary increase and to pay
a  retirement  pension  based  on  the  salary  he  earned  the  year
immediately  prior  to  this  retirement.  Accompanying  all  contract
obligations  is  the  implied  warranty  that  the  promisor  will  not
willfully prevent the promisee from enjoying the benefits thereunder.
By  mandating  retirement  at  65,  the  state  has  prevented  the  plaintiff
from  further  increasing  his  annual  salary  and  thus  increasing  the
amount  of  his  retirement  pension.  Since  he  had  this  right  under  the
employment  contract  that  existed  prior  to  passage  of  the  mandatory
retirement  law,  the  law  may  be  held  to  impair  an  obligation  of
contracts.

On the other hand, unless the plaintiff was a state employee prior to
the  passage  of  the  mandatory  retirement  law,  he  has  no  contractual
expectation  of  continued  employment  after  65.  This  is  true  even
though  he  undertook  financial  obligations  in  contemplation  of
continued employment, because although he might have detrimentally
relied  on  that  expectation,  such  reliance  was  not  justified.  B  is
therefore  incorrect.  The  fact  that  the  plaintiff  was  fit  for  continued
employment after the age of 65 would not result in a finding that the
mandatory retirement law impairs the obligation of contracts because
his  fitness  did  not  create  a  contractual  expectation  unless  he  was
employed  prior  to  passage  of  the  law.  C  and  D  are  therefore
incorrect.

183. A There are various theories that might exclude performance because of
a  change  in  circumstances,  but  all  require  that  the  change  in

1305

circumstances be unforeseeable at the time the contract was formed. If
the  defendant  knew  on  May  1  that  many  hogs  in  the  area  had
contracted  the  disease,  it  was  probably  foreseeable  to  him  that  the
hog would contract it also. If the hog's disease was foreseeable to the
defendant, it would not excuse his performance under any theory.

If  performance  required  by  a  contract  becomes  illegal  after  the
contract is formed, both parties are excused from further performance.
Thus, if the state issued an order prohibiting the exhibition of the hog,
the  defendant  would  be  excused  from  exhibiting  him,  and  the  court
would  find  against  the  plaintiff.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is
incorrect because the contract called for the exhibition of the hog, and
not merely for the exhibition of a hog with the other hog's qualities, so
the  fact  that  the  defendant  had  a  hog  like  him  is  irrelevant.  D  is
incorrect  because  if  the  change  of  circumstances  that  resulted  in  the
plaintiff's loss was unforeseeable, the plaintiff cannot collect for that
loss even if it can be established with particularity.

184.  D  Under  the  doctrine  of  accession,  the  owner  of  realty  becomes  the
owner of anything that becomes part of it as well. Thus, if the storage
building has become part of the realty, the tenant may not remove it.
Unless  the  parties  agree,  however,  the  decision  as  to  whether  the
building has become part of (i.e., annexed to) the realty can be made
only by a court. A is incorrect because the landlord does not have the
power to decide it unilaterally. B is incorrect because if the building
has become part of (i.e., annexed to) the realty, the landlord is already
its owner by accession, and cannot be required to pay for it. For the
above reasons, C is also incorrect.

185. C Private nuisance is a tortious interference with the plaintiff's right to
use and enjoy real property in which he or she has a present or future
possessory interest. In effect, a plaintiff suing a defendant for private
nuisance is claiming that the defendant's use of its realty unreasonably
violates the plaintiff's right to use his or her realty. For this reason, in
deciding  a  claim  for  private  nuisance,  the  courts  must  balance  the
rights of the plaintiff and defendant in an attempt to determine which
right is more worthy of protection. In doing so, courts consider many
factors,  including  the  relative  importance  of  the  plaintiff's  and  the
defendant's activities, the appropriateness of each to the location, and
the  ability  of  each  to  avoid  the  harm  complained  of.  Because  the
insecticide is an important agricultural product, the fact that it cannot

1306

be manufactured without producing bad smells could lead a court to
conclude that the production of bad smells is not a nuisance. It is by
no means certain that a court would come to this conclusion, but of all
the  additional  facts  listed,  C  is  the  only  one  that  might  result  in  a
judgment for the company.

the 

to  obtain 

There  was  a  time  when  a  1,000-mile  distance  might  have  made  it
impossible  for  farmers 
insecticide  from  other
manufacturers.  Then,  in  balancing  the  rights  of  the  company  against
those of the farmer, a court might have concluded that the importance
of the company's activity outweighed the importance of the farmer's,
and  that  the  manufacture  of  the  insecticide  was  therefore  not  a
nuisance.  Modern  transportation  makes  that  argument  unpersuasive,
however.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  a  tenant
(i.e.,  the  holder  of  a  leasehold  interest)  has  sufficient  possessory
interest in realty to maintain an action for private nuisance against one
who  interferes  with  his  or  her  right  to  use  or  enjoy  it.  A  private
individual may not maintain an action for public nuisance unless his
or  her  harm  is  substantially  different  from  that  sustained  by  the
general public. No such requirement is imposed on the plaintiff in a
private nuisance action, however. He or she must show only that the
defendant tortiously interfered with his or her right to use and enjoy
his or her realty. D is therefore incorrect.

186.  C  Hearsay  is  defined  as  an  out-of-court  statement  offered  for  the
purpose  of  proving  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted  in  that  statement.
The  language  of  a  promissory  note  creates  an  indebtedness.  It  is
offered into evidence for the purpose of establishing that indebtedness
(i.e.,  for  its  independent  legal  significance),  not  for  the  purpose  of
establishing  the  truth  of  any  facts  that  it  incidentally  communicates.
For this reason, it is not hearsay.

A  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  that  the  note  was
prepared  in  the  regular  course  of  business,  which  is  one  of  the
requirements  of  a  business  record.  Under  the  best  evidence  rule,
secondary evidence to prove the terms of a writing is not admissible
unless the writing itself is shown to be unavailable. This rule is thus a
rule  of  exclusion.  Although  it  may  prevent  the  admission  of  a
document that is not an original, it does not keep an original document
from being hearsay or permit the admission of an original document
that is inadmissible for other reasons. B is therefore incorrect. If an

1307

out-of-court statement is offered to prove the truth of a matter that it
asserts, it is hearsay. The fact that the declarant (i.e., the person who
made the statement) is in court does not prevent it from being hearsay
or permit its admission. D is therefore incorrect.

187.  D  Most  courts  impose  accomplice  liability  on  a  defendant  when  one
person commits a killing with reckless indifference to human life, and
the defendant, acting with the same reckless indifference, encourages
the person in the conduct leading to the death. A scenario that is likely
to  involve  accomplice  liability  for  depraved-indifference  murder  is
when  multiple  defendants  all  carry  very  dangerous  weapons  into  a
crime  scene.  Even  in  jurisdictions  not  applying  the  felony-murder
rule,  these  defendants  may  have  accomplice  liability  imposed  upon
them. Here, all three men carried extremely dangerous weapons into
the pharmacy, and all three aided and abetted each other in the crime.
The one robber then acted with depraved indifference by shooting 30
bullets into the metal ceiling, where there was a large risk of the sort
of ricochet that caused the death. Consequently, the two men who did
not  fire  their  weapons  are  accomplices  to  the  killing,  making  them
guilty  of  depraved-indifference  murder.  Thus,  A,  B,  and  C  are
incorrect.

188. D Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a), joinder of the additional contract claim
against  the  dealer  would  be  proper.  However,  a  claim  joined  under
Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  18(a)  cannot  be  brought  into  federal  court  based  on
supplemental jurisdiction unless the claims are part of the same case
or  controversy.  Because  the  contract  claim  involves  a  different
“common  nucleus  of  operative  fact”  than  the  accident,  it  must
independently  meet  the  requirements  for  federal  subject  matter
jurisdiction.  Here,  since  the  salesman  and  the  dealer  are  citizens  of
the same state, the claim would fail to do so.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  the  accident  and  the  firing  are
tangentially related, they are not part of the same case or controversy.
One claim involves the facts and evidence related to the car accident,
while the other involves facts and evidence related to the salesman's
contract. B is incorrect because the accident and the firing are not part
of  the  same  case  or  controversy,  as  stated  above.  C  is  incorrect
because all counterclaims would necessarily contain additional facts
from the main claim.

189. C The defense of improper venue is waived if it is not made either as a

1308

pre-answer  motion  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12  or  as  part  of  the
defendant's  answer.  When  the  defendants'  submitted  their  answers
without the defense, they waived it. Once that happened, “nothing . . .
shall impair the jurisdiction of a district court of any matter involving
a party who does not interpose timely and sufficient objection to the
venue.”  See  28  U.S.C.  §1406(b).  Consequently,  the  court  in  the
Western  District  of  State  A  will  get  to  hear  the  case  even  though
venue is technically improper.

Therefore, A, B, and D are incorrect.

190. B The defendant's mother's promise to pay $1,000 is enforceable only if
it is supported by consideration. Consideration is something of value
—  either  benefit  to  the  promisor  or  detriment  to  the  promisee  —
given in exchange for the promise. A promise to do something that the
promisor has no legal right to do cannot be regarded as consideration
because it has no value. Unless a privilege exists, no person has the
right  to  refuse  to  testify  in  a  criminal  prosecution.  Certainly,  no
person  may  do  so  in  return  for  payment.  Thus,  the  victim's  promise
not to testify was a promise to do something that she had no right to
do.  For  this  reason,  it  would  not  have  been  consideration  for  the
mother's promise to pay $1,000.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  the  defendant's  mother  was  not
legally obligated to pay for damage caused by her adult son, she may
have  made  an  enforceable  promise  to  do  so.  An  accord  is  an
agreement to substitute a new obligation for one that already existed.
Satisfaction occurs when the accord is completely performed. Since
the  defendant  may  have  had  a  duty  to  pay  all  the  victim's  medical
expenses resulting from his act, and since the victim agreed to accept
$250 instead, there may have been an accord that was satisfied when
the defendant's mother paid as promised. But this accord existed only
with  respect  to  the  obligation  to  pay  medical  expenses.  Since  the
obligation to pay for pain and suffering is a separate obligation, it is
not  extinguished  by  satisfaction  of  the  accord  regarding  medical
expenses.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  promise  to  pay  the  debt  of
another is unenforceable unless it is written. But a promise to pay in
return for the promisee's forbearance to sue (even a third person) is
not  a  promise  to  pay  the  debt  of  another  but  rather  a  personal
obligation  of  the  promisor.  As  such,  it  need  not  be  in  writing.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

191.  C  The  Fifth  Amendment  right  against  self-incrimination  protects  a
defendant  against  being  coerced  into  answering  questions  asked  by
the  police.  Because  police  interrogation  of  a  person  in  custody  is
inherently  coercive,  a  person  in  custody  is  entitled  to  Miranda
warnings like those given the defendant when she was first taken into
custody.  If,  after  receiving  such  warnings,  the  person  in  custody
asserts his or her right to have an attorney present during questioning,
all  interrogation  must  stop  and  may  not  be  continued  without  the
presence  of  an  attorney  or  a  subsequent  valid  waiver.  Because  any
further interrogation is regarded as coercive, a confession obtained in
its  course  is  not  admissible  in  evidence.  Although  these  rights  were
once  held  to  apply  only  to  a  person  who  was  a  suspect,  it  is  now
clear that they apply to any person in custody.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  upon  receiving  the
warnings, the defendant asserted her right to have an attorney present
during  questioning.  Although  the  police  are  required  to  advise  a
defendant of his or her rights when he or she is in custody, they are
not  required  to  advise  him  or  her  of  their  suspicions  or  of  their
reasons for asking a particular question. D is therefore incorrect.

192. C The grant of an interest in realty “for so long as” a certain condition
continues  to  exist  or  “until”  a  certain  condition  shall  exist  is
traditionally  held  to  create  a  fee  simple  determinable.  One  of  the
characteristics  of  this  particular  interest  is  that  it  terminates
automatically upon the happening of the specified event or condition.
Since the conveyance to the church was “for so long as” the land is
used  for  church  purposes,  it  was  a  fee  simple  determinable,  and  it
was  terminated  automatically  when  the  church  conveyed  the  land.
According to the language of the deed, the interest of the hospital was
to  become  possessory  at  that  time.  Although  this  might  not  have
occurred  within 
the  Rule  Against
the  period  prescribed  by 
Perpetuities,  the  hospital's  interest  is  valid  because  in  most
jurisdictions, the rule does not apply to the future interest of a charity
that follows the interest of another charity. C is correct for this reason
and because it is the only option that could possibly be correct in any
jurisdiction.

The  estate  system,  and  in  particular  the  law  of  future  interests,  was
developed  so  that  a  grantor  could  exercise  some  control  over  the
subsequent  use  of  the  land  conveyed.  For  that  reason,  restrictive

1310

language such as that contained in the landowner's deed is understood
to relate to the way the conveyed land itself is used. Although the sale
by the church might serve to enable the church to continue operation
elsewhere,  it  violates  the  special  limitation  contained  in  the
landowner's deed since it results in a cessation of the use of the land
itself  for  the  purpose  stated  in  that  limitation.  For  this  reason,  A  is
incorrect. B  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons.  First,  as  explained  above,
an  exception  prevents  the  interest  of  the  hospital  from  being  void
under  the  Rule  Against  Perpetuities.  Second,  the  Rule  Against
Perpetuities  prevents  the  vesting  of  certain  interests  but  does  not
prevent the divesting of any interest. Thus, even if the interest of the
hospital  was  void  under  the  Rule,  the  violation  of  the  special
limitation  contained  in  the  landowner's  grant  would  terminate  the
interest of the church no matter when it occurred. The language of the
landowner's grant limited the use for which the realty conveyed could
be  put.  Restrictions  of  this  kind  are  enforceable,  even  though  they
indirectly  restrain  alienation.  The  effect  of  the  language  used  by  the
landowner  is  to  divest  the  church  of  its  interest  when  the  church
ceases to use the land for church purposes. Since the sale would have
that  effect,  the  church  is  divested  of  its  interest,  and  D  is  incorrect.
(Note: Sometimes the language of a conveyance attempts to directly
restrain subsequent alienation of the interest conveyed by prohibiting
such alienation. Most of the time, courts hold that direct restraints on
alienation are invalid. If a restraint on alienation is held to be valid, it
might make the person who violated it liable for damages, but it does
not void the alienation. Thus, even if the conveyance created a direct
restraint on alienation, it would not make the subsequent conveyance
by the church invalid.)

193. B Although the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate
interstate  commerce,  some  regulation  by  the  states  is  permitted  so
long  as  the  effect  is  not  to  discriminate  against  or  impose  an  undue
burden  on  interstate  commerce.  Even  state  regulations  that  do
discriminate  against  interstate  commerce  or  impose  a  burden  on  it
may be constitutional if they are aimed at a legitimate health or safety
objective that cannot be achieved by less drastic means. It is possible
that  the  additional  fact  set  forth  in  B  would  result  in  a  finding  that
Section  40  is  valid  because  it  protects  the  health  and  safety  of  the
people  of  the  state  in  the  least  drastic  way  possible.  It  is  far  from
certain that a court would come to this conclusion, but B is the only

1311

one  of  all  the  additional  facts  listed  that  could  possibly  result  in  a
finding of constitutionality.

One  of  the  purposes  of  the  Commerce  Clause  is  to  ban  artificial
barriers  to  interstate  competition.  Since  the  fact  in  A  would  make
creation  of  a  business  advantage  for  in-state  nuclear  power  plants  a
purpose of the Section, it would show that the statute is designed to
create exactly the kind of artificial barrier that the Commerce Clause
was  designed  to  prevent.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  shortage  of
storage facilities within the state underscores the competition for the
use of such facilities. Thus, C would not justify finding Section 40 to
be  constitutional  since  its  terms  effectively  eliminate  out-of-staters
from  that  competition.  Even  if  there  are  many  safe  storage  locations
outside  the  state,  there  may  be  sound  business  reasons  why  out-of-
staters prefer to use state locations. The discrimination resulting from
the  provisions  of  Section  40  would  thus  not  be  justified  by  the
existence of out-of-state locations. D is therefore incorrect.

194. B It is generally understood that evidence of a person's bad character is
inadmissible  for  the  purpose  of  proving  that  he  or  she  acted  in  a
particular way on a particular occasion. Since evidence of a criminal
conviction is evidence of character, it is usually excluded by this rule.
Under  FRE  609,  a  judgment  of  conviction  may  be  admitted  for  the
purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness, however, because
it tends to establish that the person convicted is untrustworthy. If the
defendant did not testify, there is no reason to impeach his credibility,
and evidence of his prior conviction would be inadmissible.

On the other hand, if he did testify, evidence of his conviction would
be  admissible  under  the  FRE.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Under  FRE
609,  evidence  of  a  conviction  for  a  felony  in  any  state  or  nation  is
admissible  to  impeach  a  witness  without  regard  to  the  nature  of  the
felony.  Since  involuntary  manslaughter  is  a  felony,  C  is  incorrect.
Since the FRE make a conviction from any state or nation admissible,
D is incorrect.

195. B To get a copy of the police report, the boxer's attorney must cause the
clerk of the court to issue a subpoena duces tecum (an order requiring
the  recipient  to  appear  before  the  court  and  produce  documents)  on
the police department under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45.

A is  incorrect  because  a  request  to  produce  documents  may  only  be

1312

served  on  a  party  to  the  suit.  See  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  34. C  is  incorrect
because it is unnecessary to take the deposition of the police officer
in order to get the police report. D is incorrect because only parties to
an action are required to respond to interrogatories. See Fed. R. Civ.
P. 33(a).

196. B A plaintiff who experiences mental suffering as a result of witnessing
the  infliction  of  a  physical  injury  on  another  may  recover  from  a
person  who  negligently  inflicted  that  physical  injury.  Although  the
majority of jurisdictions permit such recovery only when the plaintiff
is  in  the  same  zone  of  physical  danger  as  the  person  who  sustained
physical injury, an important minority permit the plaintiff to recover if
his  or  her  mental  suffering  was  a  foreseeable  result  of  the  physical
injury  that  he  or  she  witnessed.  In  this  minority  of  jurisdictions,  the
plaintiff might recover from the manufacturer for her mental suffering
at witnessing the patient's death if it was likely (i.e., foreseeable) that
the  manufacturer's  negligence  in  causing  the  patient's  death  would
lead to the plaintiff's mental suffering. Because this is a minority rule,
there is no guarantee that it would lead to a judgment for the plaintiff.
Of those listed, however, B is the only argument that could possibly
be effective in support of the plaintiff's claim.

A  defendant  who  engages  in  outrageous  conduct  with  the  intent  to
cause  the  plaintiff  to  experience  mental  suffering  may  be  liable  for
mental  suffering  that  the  plaintiff  experiences  as  a  result.  A  is
incorrect,  however,  for  two  reasons:  First,  outrageous  conduct  is
conduct that exceeds bounds normally tolerated by decent society, not
conduct that creates a high probability of harm, and second, there is
no fact indicating that the manufacturer intended to cause the plaintiff
to  experience  mental  suffering.  When  a  plaintiff  voluntarily
encounters  a  risk  of  which  he  or  she  knows,  he  or  she  assumes  that
risk.  Since  the  plaintiff  did  not  know  that  the  oxygen  tank  contained
anesthetic gas, she could not have assumed the risk resulting from that
fact. C is incorrect for this reason and because assumption of the risk
would prevent the plaintiff from recovering. A defendant who intends
mental  suffering  to  result  from  its  outrageous  conduct  may  be  liable
for  the  intentional  infliction  of  mental  harm.  In  this  regard,  a
substantial  certainty  that  the  suffering  will  occur  is  equivalent  to  an
intent to bring it about. D is incorrect, however, because even if the
manufacturer  was  certain  that  the  apparatus  would  be  used  on  a
patient, it did not intend the plaintiff's suffering unless it was certain

1313

that  the  patient  would  die  and  that  the  plaintiff  would  suffer  as  a
result.

197.  B  A  conspiracy  occurs  when  two  or  more  persons  with  the  specific
intent to commit a crime agree to commit it. Since the druggist did not
believe that the wife would be hurt by the drug that he furnished, he
did  not  have  the  requisite  specific  intent  and  did  not  really  agree  to
commit murder. For this reason, there was never an actual agreement
between him and the man, and therefore no conspiracy.

Conspiracy, if it exists, is separate from the substantive crime and is
complete  when  the  unlawful  agreement  is  made.  For  this  reason,  a
defendant  may  be  guilty  of  conspiring  to  commit  a  particular  crime
even though he or she never succeeded and was not likely to succeed
in  committing  it.  A  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because  it  is  an  inaccurate  statement  of  law:  The  inchoate  crime  of
conspiracy never merges with the substantive crime; a defendant can
be convicted of both.

198. A Under FRE 803(6), a properly authenticated writing may be admitted
under the business record exception to the hearsay rule if it was made
in the regular course of business while fresh in the declarant's mind
about  facts  that  the  declarant  knew  or  learned  from  an  inherently
reliable  source.  Since  the  witness's  testimony  satisfied  all  these
requirements,  the  personnel  file  should  be  admitted  as  a  business
record.  (Note:  Do  not  be  confused  about  a  controversy  that  exists
over whether police records describing an accident  are  kept  in  the
“regular  course  of  business.”  Police  department  personnel  records
clearly are.)

B  is  incorrect  because  to  be  admissible  as  “past  recollection
recorded,” a writing must have been made by the witness himself or
herself,  and  because  under  FRE  803(5)  and  the  common  law,  the
writing may be read aloud but not physically admitted into evidence.
C  is  incorrect  because  business  records  and  official  written
statements  may  be  used  by  any  party.  Although  negative  evidence
presents some special problems, FRE 803(7) specifically permits the
absence  of  a  business  record  to  be  admissible  as  evidence  that  an
unrecorded transaction did not occur.

199. B A motion for judgment as a matter of law is made before the case is
submitted  to  a  jury  and  asks  the  court  for  judgment  in  the  moving
party's favor based on the argument that no reasonable person could

1314

come to a different conclusion. A renewed motion for judgment as a
matter of law comes after entry of judgment and can only be made if
the  moving  party  made  a  motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law
during the trial. Because the bank did not make a motion for judgment
as a matter of law during trial, it cannot now try to make one after the
entry of judgment.

A is incorrect because a motion for judgment as a matter of law does
not  need  to  be  supported  by  new  evidence.  C  and  D  are  incorrect
because the bank had to have made a motion for judgment as a matter
of  law  before  the  jury  verdict  to  have  the  court  grant  the  bank's
attempt at a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law after the
verdict.

200. A  Under  28  U.S.C.  §1446(b),  a  defendant  must  file  notice  of  removal
within  30  days  after  formal  service  of  the  complaint.  Since  the
builder removed 29 days after formal service, the builder's removal
was  timely.  See  Murphy  Brothers  v.  Michetti  Pipe  Stringing,  Inc.,
526 U.S. 344 (1999).

B  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  special  rule  regarding  notice  by
certified mail. C is incorrect because the 30-day period begins when
the defendant receives official service. D is incorrect because there is
no rule regarding challenging notice received by email.

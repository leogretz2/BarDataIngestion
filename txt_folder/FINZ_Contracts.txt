CONTRACTS

1. Immediately after his graduation from college in June, the plaintiff

announced his plan to begin law school the following September and to

237

marry his girlfriend in December. The plaintiff's father was afraid that
marriage during the plaintiff's first year of law school might cause him
to fail or drop out of school. He called the plaintiff on the phone and
said that if the plaintiff postponed his wedding plans until after the
completion of his first year of law school, he would give him a cash
bonus of $1,000 and would pay the plaintiff's tuition for the second
year of law school. The plaintiff agreed and called his girlfriend to tell
her that he wanted to postpone the wedding. She became so angry at
him that she broke off their engagement. Two months later, the
plaintiff's girlfriend married someone else.

The plaintiff's father died soon after the plaintiff began school, but the
plaintiff successfully completed his first year. Although the plaintiff
earned excellent grades, he decided that he was not really interested
enough in the law to want to continue his legal education. After failing
to register for a second year of law school, he notified his father's
administrator of his decision. The plaintiff said that although there
would be no tuition expense, he expected to be paid the $1,000 cash
bonus that his father had promised him. The administrator refused to
pay anything.

If the plaintiff brought suit against the administrator of his father's
estate for $1,000, the plaintiff would probably be

(A) unsuccessful, because his contract with his father violated public

policy.

(B) unsuccessful, because the plaintiff failed to register for a second

year of law school.

(C) unsuccessful, because the plaintiff's death terminated his offer.

(D) successful.

2. A furniture dealer had 500 chairs for sale. The chairs had a fair market
value of $100 each. The manufacturer had discontinued production of
the chairs, however, and they were the last ones the dealer had. For
that reason, the dealer advertised them at $75 each, even though at that
price, her profit would be only $10 per chair. An interior decorator
had contracted with the dealer to provide furniture for a new hotel. On
May 4, after seeing the chairs advertised, the decorator wired the
dealer, “Please ship me 500 chairs as advertised at $75 per chair
COD.” On May 5, immediately upon receipt of the telegram, the dealer

238

wired the decorator, “Accept your offer. Will ship 500 chairs
tomorrow.” The decorator telephoned the dealer immediately upon
receipt of the dealer's telegram on May 6, saying that, after discussing
the chairs with his client, he had decided to cancel the order. On May
7, the dealer sold all the chairs to another buyer at $75 each. If the
dealer sued the decorator for breach of contract, the court should
award the dealer

(A) $5,000 (500 chairs at $10 profit per chair).

(B) $37,500 (500 chairs at $75 per chair).

(C) $12,500 (fair market value of $100 minus contract price of $75

times 500 chairs).

(D) nothing, since the dealer sustained no damage.

3. On March 12, the plaintiff hired the defendant to construct a three-car
garage on the plaintiff's realty. After negotiation, they entered into a
valid written contract that fixed the price at $8,000. According to the
terms of the contract, the plaintiff was to pay $4,000 when the work
was half completed, on or before April 25, and to pay the balance upon
completion. All work was to be completed by June 1. On April 10,
when the work was one-quarter complete, the partial structure was
totally destroyed in a fire that started without fault by either party. The
damage done by the fire made it impossible to complete construction
on time. Because he was committed to begin construction on a hotel on
June 1, the defendant notified the plaintiff on April 12 that he would
perform no further work for the plaintiff. The plaintiff subsequently
hired another contractor to build the garage at a price of $9,000. The
plaintiff instituted an action against the defendant for damages resulting
from breach of contract, and the defendant asserted a defense based on
impossibility of performance. The court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the fire was not his fault.

(B) the defendant, because he has not yet received any compensation

from the plaintiff.

(C) the plaintiff, because the work was only one-quarter complete when

fire destroyed the structure.

(D) the plaintiff, because the defendant's obligation was to work for the

plaintiff until June 1.

4. The buyer agreed to purchase 250 2” × 4” construction-grade wooden

239

studs from the seller by a written contract that provided that the buyer
would make payment prior to inspection. The studs were delivered to
the buyer by truck and were covered with a canvas tarpaulin when they
arrived at the buyer's work site. The driver demanded payment before
he would unload or uncover the studs.

The buyer refused to pay for the studs before inspecting them, and the
driver returned them to the seller. If the seller asserts a claim for
breach of contract against the buyer, the court should find for

(A) the seller, because the buyer's refusal to pay prior to inspection

was a breach.

(B) the seller, because the buyer's refusal to pay prior to inspection was

an anticipatory repudiation.

(C) the buyer, because the contract provision calling for payment prior

to inspection was unconscionable.

(D) the buyer, because the seller failed to deliver the studs.

5. A manufacturer of computer hardware and software was seeking a way
to speed up the operation of its Basic Computer Program. On March 1,
it posted the following notice in the employees' lounge:

The stockholders of this company are offering a cash prize of $200 to
any employee who develops a modification of the Basic Computer
Program that will double its operating speed. Design modification
entries should be submitted to the head of the Basic Program
Department prior to June 1. In the event that modifications are
submitted by more than one employee, the prize will go to the
employee who submits the design which, in the opinion of the Basic
Program Department, can be used most economically.

An engineer employed by the company read the notice on March 5, and
immediately began working on program modifications in his spare
time. On March 8, he wrote and signed a memo that said, “I accept the
stockholders' offer of a $200 prize for redesigning the Basic Computer
Program. I am hard at work on the project and expect to submit my
modification design within a week or two.” The engineer sent the note
to the head of the Basic Program Department by the interoffice
correspondence system, but it was somehow diverted and was never
received by the department head. The notice that was posted on March

240

1 constituted

(A) an offer for a unilateral contract.

(B) an offer for a bilateral contract.

(C) an offer for a unilateral contract that ripened into a bilateral
contract when the engineer wrote the memo on March 8 and
deposited it in the interoffice correspondence system.

(D) a preliminary invitation to deal, analogous to a newspaper

advertisement for the sale of goods.

6. When he moved into a new condo, the owner entered into a written
contract with a gardener. Pursuant to its terms, the gardener was to
perform certain specified gardening services in the yard of the condo
each week for a period of one year, for which the owner was to pay the
sum of $50 per month. The contract contained a clause that stated, “The
condo owner hereby agrees not to assign this contract without the
written permission of the gardener.” Three months after entering into
the agreement, the owner informed the gardener that he was selling the
condominium to the plaintiff, and asked the gardener to consent to the
owner's assignment of the contract to the plaintiff. Because the costs of
landscaping materials had increased dramatically in the last three
months, the gardener was glad for an opportunity to be relieved of his
obligations under the contract and refused to consent to the assignment.
The owner assigned the contract to the plaintiff anyway, but the
gardener refused to perform any further work on the yard. After
formally demanding performance from the gardener, the plaintiff hired
another gardener to do the same work for $75 per month, which was
the best price the plaintiff could negotiate.

In an action by the plaintiff against the gardener for breach of contract,
the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the gardener had no right to unreasonably

withhold consent to the assignment.

(B) the plaintiff, because the assignment was valid in spite of the

gardener's refusal to consent.

(C) the gardener, because the contract prohibited assignment by the

owner without the gardener's consent.

(D) the gardener, because the contract was for personal services.

241

7. On June 1, after arson fires had damaged several city buildings, the
city council voted to offer a reward to aid in apprehension of the
arsonists. On June 2, by order of the city council, signs were posted in
various locations throughout the city. The posters identified the
buildings that had been burned and stated: “$1,000 REWARD is
hereby offered by the city to any person furnishing information leading
to the conviction of persons responsible for setting fire to said
buildings.” A police officer employed by the city saw the posters on
June 5 and resolved to make a special effort to catch the arsonists.
Although he was not officially assigned to the case, he notified his
fellow police officers and his usual underworld informants that he was
especially interested in the case. As a result, another police officer and
an underworld informant passed information to the police officer that
they thought might relate to the arson crimes. The tip the first police
officer received from the other officer proved to be of no assistance,
but the tip he received from the informant led him to conduct a further
investigation. His efforts eventually resulted in the arrest of two men
who pleaded guilty to setting fires in public buildings. The first police
officer demanded that the city council pay him $1,000, but the council
refused.

If the police officer institutes a lawsuit against the city for the $1,000
reward offered in the signs posted on June 2, which of the following
would be the city's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The reward should go to the informant, since it was his information

that eventually led to the arrest of the arsonists.

(B) The reward was not accepted, since the arsonists were not

convicted but pleaded guilty.

(C) The police officer gave no consideration for the city's promise to
pay a reward, since he was already obligated to attempt the
apprehension of the arsonists.

(D) There was no enforceable promise by the city, since the offer was

for a gratuitous cash award.

8. A foreign country is an English-speaking republic on the continent of
Europe. Its unit of currency is the “dollar,” which is worth about 85
U.S. cents. While on a business trip in the United States, the plaintiff,
who owned a glue factory in the foreign country, entered into a written
contract with the defendant. According to the contract, the defendant

242

was to purchase 30 tons of liquid glue from the plaintiff, to be
delivered on or before July 10. The contract stated the total price of the
glue to be “NINE THOUSAND ($9,000) DOLLARS.” After receiving
the shipment, the defendant sent the plaintiff an international money
order for 9,000 of the foreign country's dollars. The plaintiff wrote to
the defendant, claiming that the agreement called for the payment of
9,000 U.S. dollars, but the defendant refused to make any further
payment. The plaintiff instituted an action against the defendant in the
United States and offered to testify that, prior to executing the written
memorandum, she and the defendant agreed that the price expressed in
the writing was to be in U.S. dollars.

If the defendant objects to the testimony, the objection should be

(A) sustained, since the oral agreement about which the plaintiff is

offering to testify was made prior to the execution of the written
memorandum of sale.

(B) sustained, only if the written memorandum was prepared by the

defendant.

(C) overruled, unless the writing is found to be a complete integration

of the agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff.

(D) overruled, because the evidence that the plaintiff is offering to
present does not modify or contradict the terms of the writing.

9. The plaintiff was fishing on her boat when she heard a call for help.

Looking around, she saw a man drowning and flailing his arms over his
head. The plaintiff jumped into the water and swam toward the man,
dropping her fishing gear into the lake and losing it in her effort to aid
the man. She grabbed the man by the hair and swam to the shore,
dragging him out of the water. The man was unconscious, but she gave
him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until he regained consciousness.
When the man opened his eyes, he said, “I know I can never repay you
for saving my life, but I promise to pay you $100 the first of next month
as a token of my gratitude.” A few days later, the man died from causes
not related to the incident.

The following month, the plaintiff made demand upon the man's
executor for the $100 that the man promised her and for an additional
$100, which was the value of the fishing gear that she lost in her
attempt to rescue the man. The executor rejected both demands. If the

243

plaintiff institutes an action for the value of her fishing gear against the
executor of the man's estate, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, on a theory of quantum meruit.

(B) the plaintiff, because danger invites rescue.

(C) the plaintiff, because the reasonable person in the man's position
would have offered to pay for the loss of the fishing gear in
exchange for the plaintiff's attempt to rescue him or her.

(D) the executor of the man's estate.

10. A woman's hobby was restoring and collecting antique automobiles.

After acquiring an antique automobile, she contacted a body shop about
having the car repainted. The body shop said that it would paint the car
for $700 and would sell the woman a new bumper for an additional
$150. Using an order blank from a pad that he purchased at a stationery
store, the body shop's owner wrote out all the terms of the agreement.
On a printed line marked “PAYMENT,” he wrote, “Paint job—$700,
payable $300 in advance and $400 on completion. Bumper—$150
payable on delivery.” Both the body shop's owner and the woman
signed at the bottom of the form. Which of the following statements
most correctly describes the obligations set forth in the writing signed
by the woman and the body shop owner?

(A) Payment by the woman of the initial $300 is a condition precedent
to the body shop's obligation to paint the car, and the body shop's
painting of the car is a condition precedent to the woman's
obligation to pay the additional $400.

(B) Payment by the woman of the initial $300 is a condition precedent
in form and substance to the body shop's obligation to paint the car,
and the body shop's painting of the car is a condition precedent in
form, but subsequent in substance to the woman's obligation to pay
the additional $400.

(C) Payment by the woman and painting of the car by the body shop are

concurrent conditions.

(D) Neither party's obligation to perform is conditioned upon

performance by the other party.

11. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as department manager
pursuant to a written contract. The contract was for a five-year term
and fixed the plaintiff's compensation at $2,000 per month. The

244

plaintiff's work was satisfactory, but two years after entering into the
contract with him, the defendant reorganized the company. As a result
of the reorganization, the plaintiff's department was eliminated, and the
defendant terminated the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff
advertised in the “jobs wanted” section of the newspaper, but he did
not find a job until six months after his discharge, when he went to
work for another company doing the same general sort of work that he
had been doing for the defendant and earning the same salary. In an
action by the plaintiff against the defendant for damages resulting from
breach of the employment contract, the court should give judgment to

(A) the defendant, since the plaintiff's position was eliminated.

(B) the plaintiff, for severance pay in a sum equivalent to two months'

salary.

(C) the plaintiff, in a sum equivalent to the salary that the plaintiff lost
between the time of his discharge and the time he began working
for the new company, plus the cost of advertising in the “jobs
wanted” section of the newspaper.

(D) the plaintiff, in a sum equivalent to the salary that the plaintiff
would have received during the balance of the contract term.

12. The plaintiff was the owner of a fleet of taxis that he leased to

independent drivers in return for 60 percent of the fares that they
collected. All the leases were scheduled to expire on December 31.
Because the cars in his fleet were beginning to look shabby, the
plaintiff decided to have them all painted during the first week of
January, before negotiating new leases with the drivers. At the
beginning of December, he called the defendant's auto-painting
company to inquire about his price for painting all the cars in the
plaintiff's fleet. The defendant said he would do the job for $150 per
car.

The plaintiff said, “I'm talking about 60 cars. That's a lot of business.
I'll give you the job if you'll do it for $125 per car.”

“I'd really like to have your business,” replied the defendant.

“See you the first week in January,” the plaintiff said.

On January 3, the plaintiff brought one of his taxis to the paint shop
and offered to make arrangements for bringing in the rest of the cars to

245

be painted. The defendant said that he had just obtained a contract to
paint some school buses and that he was too busy to do any work for
the plaintiff. The plaintiff subsequently asserted a claim for damages
against the defendant.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the
only one true, would be most helpful to the plaintiff in his action
against the defendant?

(A) The defendant's statement, “I'd really like to have your business,”

implied a promise to paint all the cars in the plaintiff's fleet at $125
per car.

(B) The plaintiff relied on the defendant's statement by bringing the taxi

to the shop.

(C) Immediately prior to January 3, the plaintiff could have had the

taxis painted at another shop for $125 each, but immediately after
January 3, the lowest price he could find was $150.

(D) On January 3, when the defendant told the plaintiff that he was too
busy to do the work, the plaintiff offered to pay the defendant $150
per car and tendered payment of that sum.

13. When the plaintiff's uncle died, he left her a 10-story office building

that had a motion picture theater on its ground floor. The offices in the
building were all occupied when the plaintiff acquired title to it. The
motion picture theater was vacant, however, so she advertised for a
tenant. The defendant had researched the neighborhood and decided
that it was a good location for a pornographic movie theater. When he
saw the plaintiff's advertisement, he contacted her and said that he was
interested in leasing the theater. He did not tell her what type of films
he intended to show because he thought that she might be unwilling to
rent it to him for that purpose. On April 1, they entered into a written
rental agreement for the theater, occupancy to begin on May 1. On
April 15, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the showing
of pornographic films in the neighborhood where the theater was
located. As a result, the defendant advised the plaintiff that he was
canceling the rental agreement.

If the plaintiff sues the defendant for breach of contract, the court
should find for

(A) the defendant, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

246

(B) the defendant, under the doctrine of impossibility of performance.

(C) the defendant, because after the contract had been formed,
government action made its subject matter unlawful.

(D) the plaintiff.

14. A builder contracted to add a room to a homeowner's house for $3,000,
with the understanding that the materials used by the builder were to be
included in that price. The day before work was to begin, the
homeowner wired the builder, “The deal is off. Do not begin work.”
The builder subsequently asserted a claim against the homeowner for
breach of contract. The homeowner raised non-compliance with the
Statute of Frauds as a defense. Which of the following statements is
most correct about the application of the Statute of Frauds to the
contract between the homeowner and the builder?

(A) The contract was required to be in writing if the materials that
would have been required had a price in excess of $500.

(B) The contract was required to be in writing if, at the time of

contracting, the parties intended that the materials required would
have a price in excess of $500.

(C) The contract was required to be in writing if the materials that

would have been required had a price in excess of $500, and the
parties intended that the materials required would have a price in
excess of $500 at the time of contracting.

(D) The contract was not required to be in writing.

15. After the plaintiff said that the defendant owed him $3,000, the

defendant promised to pay $2,000, which the plaintiff agreed to accept
as payment in full. Subsequently, the defendant refused to make
payment, and the plaintiff asserted a claim for $2,000 based on the
defendant's promise. If it was the only one true at the time of the
defendant's promise, which of the following additional facts or
inferences would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
plaintiff?

(A) The defendant honestly believed that he owed the plaintiff $3,000,
but the plaintiff did not believe that the defendant owed him the
money.

(B) The plaintiff honestly believed that the defendant owed him $3,000,
but the defendant did not believe that he owed the plaintiff the

247

money.

(C) The plaintiff was threatening to institute a lawsuit against the

defendant for $3,000 plus costs and interest.

(D) The plaintiff had already commenced a lawsuit against the

defendant for $3,000 plus costs and interest.

16. A building contractor's daughter was about to celebrate her 21st
birthday, and the contractor wanted to give her a gift that would
express his sentiments for her. He was a wealthy and successful
contractor, but he had begun his career as an assistant bricklayer.
Instead of purchasing something for his daughter, he decided to give
her a gift with the labor of his hands. The contractor entered into a
written contract with the defendant. According to its terms, the
contractor agreed to build a brick fireplace for the defendant,
performing all the labor himself. In return, the defendant agreed to pay
the sum of $1,000 to the contractor's daughter on her birthday, February
12, upon completion of the work by the contractor to the defendant's
satisfaction. The daughter did not learn of the transaction until
February 12. Before signing the written contract, the defendant and the
contractor agreed orally that the defendant would make a reasonable
effort to obtain a loan to pay for the work, but that if the defendant was
unsuccessful in doing so by January 1, the agreement between them
would be of no effect. The defendant made efforts to obtain the loan but
could not do so. On January 1, the defendant informed the contractor
that because he was unable to obtain the loan, he was calling off the
deal. In an action for breach of contract brought against the defendant
by the proper party, will the defendant be successful in asserting as a
defense his inability to obtain a loan?

(A) Yes, because obtaining a loan was a condition precedent to the

existence of an enforceable contract.

(B) Yes, because a modification of a construction contract may be by

oral agreement.

(C) No, because the defendant is estopped from denying the validity of

the written agreement.

(D) No, because the agreement concerning the loan is an oral agreement
that was made prior to the writing and it contradicts the terms of
the writing.

17. Assume that the defendant in each of the following fact patterns objects

248

to enforcement of the agreement on the ground that it violates the
Statute of Frauds. In which of the following fact patterns is the
agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant LEAST likely to be
enforced over the defendant's objection?

(A) The defendant orally agreed to purchase a series of porcelain

figurines from the plaintiff to be delivered one per week for 15
weeks at a price of $100 per figurine. Prior to the first delivery, the
defendant advised the plaintiff that he was no longer interested in
receiving the figurines.

(B) The defendant orally agreed to purchase a hand-carved entry door
for the defendant's home with the defendant's coat of arms on it for
a price of $600. After the plaintiff completed the rough carving of
the defendant's coat of arms, the defendant changed her mind and
notified the plaintiff that she would not accept delivery of the door.

(C) The defendant's pleadings admitted making an oral agreement to
purchase a painting from the plaintiff for $900 but asserted as an
affirmative defense that the agreement was unenforceable under the
Statute of Frauds.

(D) The defendant orally agreed to a price of $1,200 for the purchase

of 100 lawn-trimmers manufactured by the plaintiff for resale in the
defendant's store. The plaintiff then sent the defendant a
memorandum signed by the plaintiff and outlining the terms of their
agreement. The defendant did not sign the memorandum or respond
to it in any way.

18. The plaintiff, a minor, purchased a used car from the defendant for

$1,200. The reasonable rental value of the car was $150 per month.
After she had owned the car for two months, the steering failed while
she was driving it, causing it to collide with a tree. Although the
plaintiff was unhurt, the car sustained $400 worth of damage. The
plaintiff returned the damaged car to the defendant and demanded her
money back, but the defendant refused to refund her money. If the
plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant, the court should award
her a judgment in the amount of

(A) $1,200 (the full purchase price of the car).

(B) $900 (the purchase price of the car less its reasonable rental

value).

249

(C) $800 (the purchase price of the car less the damage that it

sustained).

(D) nothing.

19. The seller and the buyer were neighbors who owned homes on

adjoining parcels of realty. They were both in the business of selling
art supplies, each operating an art supply store that engaged in friendly
competition with the other. The seller owned a garden tractor that he
used for cultivating vegetables in the backyard of his home. The buyer,
who wanted to plant a garden in his own backyard, sent the seller a
note in which he offered to buy the tractor from the seller for $500. The
seller responded on February 15 by sending the buyer a letter that
stated, “I will sell you my garden tractor for $600, and not a penny
less. To give you time to think it over, I promise to hold this offer open
until March 15.” On March 5, the buyer noticed a similar garden
tractor in the yard of another neighbor. He called that neighbor on the
phone and offered to buy it for $500, but he said, “Are you kidding? I
just bought it from [the seller] for $600.” On March 6, the buyer went
to the seller's store with $600 in cash, and said, “I've decided to buy
that tractor from you. Here's the money.” The seller refused the money
and told the buyer that he had already sold the tractor to the other
neighbor. If the buyer asserts a claim against the seller for damages
resulting from the seller's refusal to sell the tractor on March 6, the
court should find for

(A) the buyer, because the seller's offer of February 15 was irrevocable

until March 15.

(B) the buyer, because the seller did not notify him that he was

withdrawing his offer to sell the buyer the garden tractor until after
the buyer accepted it.

(C) the seller, because the buyer learned of the sale to the other

neighbor on March 5.

(D) the seller, because his letter of February 15 was a rejection of the

buyer's original offer to purchase the garden tractor.

20. The seller and the buyer entered into a written contract for the sale of
200 electric power drills. Although they orally agreed on a price, they
inadvertently failed to include it among the terms of the written
agreement. In an action for breach of the contract, the court should

(A) admit oral testimony to establish the price that the parties intended.

250

(B) refuse to enforce the contract if it is one that the Statute of Frauds

required to be in writing.

(C) conclude that the contract calls for the payment of a reasonable

price.

(D) disregard the writing since it fails to contain all the essential terms

of the agreement.

21. On May 15, after negotiation, a painter and a homeowner entered into a

written agreement for the painting of the homeowner's home. The
writing stated that the price was to be $300 plus the cost of materials,
that the work was to begin on June 2 and be completed by June 12, that
stucco portions of the house were to be painted yellow and wood trim
was to be painted brown, and that the written memorandum was a full
and final expression of the agreement between the painter and the
homeowner. During litigation between the painter and the homeowner
to enforce the contract, the homeowner offered to testify to the
following additional facts. Which is the LEAST likely to be admitted
into evidence over timely objection by the painter?

(A) Prior to signing the memorandum, the painter and the homeowner
orally agreed that the contract would have no legal effect if the
homeowner sold his house prior to June 2.

(B) Prior to signing the memorandum, the painter and the homeowner
orally agreed that the homeowner would use no paint without first
submitting it for the homeowner's approval.

(C) While signing the memorandum, the painter and the homeowner
orally agreed that any promises made by either of them during
negotiations were to be enforceable, even if they were omitted
from the memorandum.

(D) While signing the memorandum, the painter and the homeowner
orally agreed that the painter would spend no more than $10 per
gallon for paint.

22. On May 20, on a form provided by an air-conditioning company, the
defendant agreed to purchase from the company 100 described air-
conditioning units at a price of $250 each, FOB the company's factory.
The contract contained a clause that prohibited either party from
assigning its rights or obligations under the contract without the consent
of the other party. On June 1, the company's employees loaded the units

251

on a truck owned and operated by an independent trucking company.
When the loading was complete, the air-conditioning company phoned
the defendant that the shipment was on its way. Later that day, the
company executed a document that contained the following language:
“In consideration of $20,000 to me in hand paid by the plaintiff this
date, I hereby assign to the plaintiff all rights under my contract with
the defendant dated May 20.” On June 2, while en route to the
defendant's warehouse, the truck containing the air-conditioning units
overturned, and the entire shipment was destroyed.

The defendant did not consent to the company's assignment of rights to
the plaintiff. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, the
plaintiff will probably recover

(A) the contract price of $25,000 (100 air-conditioning units at $250

each).

(B) the difference between the contract price and the market value of

the air-conditioning units.

(C) nothing, since recovery from the defendant would unjustly enrich

the plaintiff.

(D) nothing, since the contract between the defendant and the plaintiff

prohibited assignment.

23. A world-renowned artist's will left a collection of 30 of his paintings
to his niece, an art dealer. The paintings inherited by the niece were
untitled, but they were identified by the numbers 1 through 30. The
niece had a catalog printed containing photographs and descriptions of
each painting in the collection. On August 1, she sent a copy of the
catalog to another art dealer, with the following cover letter:

I  know  how  much  you  like  my  uncle's  work,  so  I'm  giving  you  an
opportunity to buy some of these paintings before I offer them to any
other  dealers.  The  price  is  $2,000  per  painting,  no  matter  how  many
you  buy.  Telegraph  your  order  within  two  weeks,  or  I'll  put  them  on
the market.

(signed)

On August 2, the art dealer sent the niece a telegram that said, “I
accept your offer to sell painting Number 30 for $2,000. I will come to
your gallery in two days to pick up the painting, and will pay cash at

252

that time.”

On August 3, after receiving the telegram, the niece telephoned the
dealer and said that because of favorable publicity that the collection
had received, she would not sell painting Number 30 for less than
$3,000. The dealer agreed on the telephone to pay $3,000 for painting
Number 30. Between August 1 and August 3 the fair market value of
the painting increased by $1,000.

On August 4, the dealer sent and the niece received a telegram that
said, “I accept your offer to sell your uncle's paintings 1 through 29 for
$2,000 each. I will pick up the paintings tomorrow, and will pay for
them at that time.”

On August 5, the dealer presented herself at the niece's gallery and
tendered payment of $2,000 each for all 30 paintings. However, the
niece refused to sell her any of the paintings except Number 30, for
which the niece insisted the agreed price was $3,000. The dealer left
without buying it, saying that the niece would be hearing from her
lawyer.

If the niece asserts a claim against the dealer for breach of a contract
to purchase painting Number 30 for $3,000, the court should find for

(A) the dealer, because her promise to pay $3,000 for the painting was

not in writing.

(B) the niece, because the fair market value of painting Number 30

increased by $1,000 between August 1 and August 3.

(C) the niece, because she relied on the dealer's promise to pay $3,000

for painting Number 30.

(D) the niece, because she had not received payment from the dealer

prior to their conversation on August 3.

24. On March 1, an aluminum siding contractor entered into a written

contract with the homeowner for the installation of aluminum siding on
the exterior of the homeowner's home. The contract called for
completion of the job by April 1 and contained a clause that prohibited
assignment by either party without the other party's written consent.
The contractor started work immediately upon the signing of the
contract. On March 15, the homeowner sold his house, assigning to the

253

new owner his contract with the contractor.

In which of the following fact situations is the plaintiff LEAST likely
to succeed in his action against the defendant?

(A) The contractor finished the job in a workmanlike manner on March
29 and demanded but did not receive payment. The contractor
instituted an action against the original homeowner for payment.

(B) The contractor finished the job in a workmanlike manner on March
29 and demanded but did not receive payment. The contractor
instituted an action against the new owner for payment.

(C) When the contractor learned of the home-

owner's assignment to the new owner, he refused to do any further
work. The original homeowner instituted an action against the
contractor for breach of contract on April 15.

(D) When the contractor learned of the original homeowner's

assignment to the new owner, he refused to do any further work.
The new owner instituted an action against the contractor for
breach of contract on April 15.

25. On August 1, a wholesaler of office supplies contracted by telephone
to sell 50 cases of typewriter ribbons to a business equipment retailer
at a total price of $450. On August 15, the wholesaler telephoned the
retailer and told him that because of a shortage of materials, the price
that the wholesaler had to pay for typewriter ribbons had increased
drastically. The wholesaler said that if he delivered the ribbons at the
price of $450, he would lose a great deal of money. He asked the
retailer to consent to a higher price, suggesting that the retailer pass the
increase along to his customers. After further discussion, the retailer
and the wholesaler agreed to change the price of the order from $450
to $650. On August 18, the retailer succeeded in purchasing 50 cases
of typewriter ribbons from another supplier for $500. On September 1,
the wholesaler delivered 50 cases of typewriter ribbons to the retailer,
together with a bill for $650. The retailer rejected the delivery.

In an action by the wholesaler against the retailer for breach of
contract, which of the following would be the retailer's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) The wholesaler's demand for more money was unconscionable,
since typewriter ribbons were available at a lower price.

254

(B) The August 15 agreement increasing the price was not in writing.

(C) The retailer's promise to pay $650 was unsupported by

consideration.

(D) An increase in the wholesaler's cost resulting from a shortage of

materials was foreseeable on August 1.

26. The seller was an importer of arts and crafts products from

Mediterranean countries, selling mainly to large department stores and
import shops. To keep his sales force down to a minimum, the seller
did most of his selling by sending catalogs describing products and
prices to prospective customers and taking orders by mail on forms
provided with the catalogs. The phrase “10 percent discount on COD
orders only” appeared on the order form and on each page of the
catalog. After receiving one of the seller's catalogs, the buyer decided
to order 1,000 Greek coffeepots for sale in her import shop. On April
25, she typed the following across the seller's order form: “Send
immediately 1,000 Greek coffeepots (Catalog #6047) at 10 percent
discount. Payment within 10 days of receipt and acceptance.” The
seller received the order on April 27. On April 28, the seller shipped
1,000 Greek coffeepots to the buyer, who received and accepted them
on May 2. On April 29, the seller wrote to the buyer, “I am shipping
pursuant to your request and will expect payment within 10 days. Since
discounts apply only to COD shipments, you are herewith billed at full
price.” The buyer received the letter and enclosed bill on May 3. On
May 4, the buyer sent the seller a check in payment of the amount
billed, less 10 percent.

When was a contract for sale of the coffeepots formed?

(A) On April 25, when the buyer sent the order to the seller.

(B) On April 27, when the seller received the order from the buyer.

(C) On April 28, when the seller shipped the coffeepots to the buyer.

(D) On May 2, when the buyer received the shipment of coffeepots.

27. After lengthy negotiations, the plaintiff purchased a car from the

defendant, a car dealer. The plaintiff was driving it the following day
when the brakes failed due to a defect that existed at the time the
defendant delivered the car to the plaintiff. As a result, the car collided
with a pole and was damaged. The plaintiff asserted a claim against
the defendant for damages resulting from breach of the implied

255

warranty of merchantability. Which one of the following additional
facts, if it were the only one true, would be most likely to result in a
judgment for the defendant?

(A) At the time of the sale, both the defendant and the plaintiff signed a

document stating that the car was being sold “as is.”

(B) The car that the plaintiff bought from the defendant was a used car.

(C) The defect that caused the brakes to fail could not have been
discovered by reasonable inspection prior to the sale.

(D) The plaintiff purchased the car in reliance on the advice of a
mechanic whom she hired to inspect it prior to making the
purchase.

28. The defendant, who broke his leg falling from a ladder, was treated by
a doctor. At the time treatment began, the defendant explained that he
was short of cash, but that his treatment was covered by group
insurance. The doctor agreed to wait for his fee until the insurance
company made payment and offered to bill the insurance company
directly for the services that he rendered to the defendant. The
defendant provided the doctor with claim forms from the company that
insured the defendant's union. The doctor filled out the form, had the
defendant sign a portion of it authorizing the insurance company to
make payment directly to the doctor, and submitted the form to the
company. Because of an error by employees of the insurance company,
the payment was sent to the defendant, who failed to make any payment
at all to the doctor.

If the doctor asserts a claim against the defendant to recover the
amount of the unpaid bill, the court will probably find for

(A) the doctor, because he is a creditor third-party beneficiary of the

group insurance policy that covered the defendant.

(B) the doctor, because the defendant impliedly promised to pay the

doctor for his services.

(C) the defendant, because the doctor agreed to accept payment from

the insurance company.

(D) the defendant, because the doctor billed the insurance company

directly.

29. A landowner wanted to open an amusement park on a parcel of real

256

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

estate that he owned. After negotiation, the landowner hired a
contractor to build a roller coaster and several other amusement
devices on the land according to specifications furnished by the
landowner. The landowner and the contractor entered into a written
contract by which the contractor agreed to begin construction on
August 1, to be finished with everything but the roller coaster by
November 1, and to complete construction of the roller coaster by
December 15. The contract price was $150,000, to be paid as follows:
$50,000 on August 1, $50,000 upon completion of everything but the
roller coaster, and the balance of $50,000 upon completion of the
roller coaster. The contractor began work on August 1, after receiving
$50,000 from the landowner. By November 1, the contractor
completed construction of everything but the roller coaster in
accordance with the specifications.

On November 1, the contractor demanded the landowner pay him
$50,000, but the landowner refused to do so. Which of the following
statements is most correct concerning the rights of the contractor?

(A) The contractor is entitled to damages limited to the sum of $50,000.

(B) The contractor is entitled to damages in the sum of $100,000.

(C) The contractor may refuse to perform any further work without

incurring liability for breach of contract.

(D) The contractor may not sue the landowner for breach of contract

until he completes construction of the roller coaster.

30. A landowner was suffering from a terminal disease and did not expect
to live much longer. She was the owner of a parcel of realty known as
Blackacre and wanted her son to have it. Blackacre was worth
$500,000, but it was subject to a non-assumable mortgage securing a
note with a balance of $100,000. For this reason, the landowner
offered to sell Blackacre to her son for $100,000. Her son said that he
would like to buy it, but that it would take him a while to raise the
money. Fearful that she would die before the transaction could be
completed and that her administratrix would be unwilling to sell the
realty to her son for that price, the landowner wrote and signed a
document that said, “In consideration of $20 paid to me by my son, I
hereby promise to convey my realty known as Blackacre to him for the
sum of $100,000 if he pays the entire purchase price within one
month.” Two days later, the landowner died. One week after that, her

257

son tendered the sum of $100,000 to the administratrix of the
landowner's estate, demanding that she convey Blackacre to him, but
the administratrix refused.

If the son instituted a proceeding against the landowner's
administratrix for an order directing her to sell Blackacre to him for
$100,000, the court should find for

(A) the son, because the document written and signed by the landowner

was a valid option contract.

(B) the son, because the document written and signed by the landowner

was intended to be a testamentary substitute.

(C) the landowner's administratrix, because $20 is not sufficient

consideration for a $100,000 option.

(D) the landowner's administratrix, because $100,000 is not sufficient

consideration for realty valued at $500,000.

31. The plaintiff, a minor who looked older than he was, wished to

purchase a motorcycle. The plaintiff went to the defendant's motorcycle
shop and looked at some of the models on display. Selecting a
motorcycle he liked, he began negotiating with the defendant. The
defendant offered to sell him the motorcycle that was on display in the
showroom, but the plaintiff said that he wanted a new one. The
defendant explained that the display model was the only one she had,
but she said that she was planning to order some new motorcycles from
the manufacturer anyway and would order one for the plaintiff if he
agreed to purchase it. The plaintiff and the defendant entered into a
written contract for the sale of a new motorcycle at a price of $1,000,
to be paid on delivery within two weeks. The following day, the
defendant ordered 10 new motorcycles from the manufacturer, and the
plaintiff purchased materials and began building a storage shed for the
motorcycle.

One week after contracting with the plaintiff, the defendant notified the
plaintiff that the new motorcycle was ready for delivery, but that the
defendant would not deliver it to the plaintiff unless the plaintiff either
proved himself to be over the age of majority or found an adult to act
as co-purchaser of the motorcycle. If the plaintiff immediately
commenced an action against the defendant for breach of contract, the
court should find for

258

(A) the defendant, because if she delivered the motorcycle to the

plaintiff, the plaintiff might subsequently disaffirm the contract and
demand the return of the purchase price.

(B) the defendant, because the plaintiff lacked contractual capacity.

(C) the plaintiff, because he purchased materials for and began

construction of a storage shed for the motorcycle in justified
reliance on the defendant's promise to deliver it.

(D) the plaintiff, because one who contracts with a minor is obligated

to perform.

32. On March 22, by a written memorandum signed by both parties, the

seller agreed to sell and the buyer agreed to buy a described parcel of
realty. The buyer and seller were both in the business of buying and
selling real estate. The contract called for closing of title on May 30
and fixed all other terms, but it did not indicate the price to be paid. On
May 30, the buyer tendered $60,000 cash, but the seller refused to
convey the realty. The buyer subsequently instituted an action against
the seller for specific performance of the contract and offered evidence
that $60,000 was the fair market value of the realty both on March 22
and on May 30. In defense, the seller asserted that the memorandum
failed to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. The buyer's
suit against the seller should

(A) succeed, because the buyer and the seller are both in the business

of buying and selling real estate.

(B) succeed, because under the UCC, a contract that is silent as to price

is presumed to call for payment of fair market value.

(C) fail, because the written contract did not fix the price to be paid.

(D) succeed, because there is likely evidence establishing that the

parties orally agreed that the price to be paid was the fair market
value of the realty.

33. A rescuer saved the life of a man's wife, who subsequently promised to

change her will to leave $500 to the rescuer. The wife later died
intestate, however, survived only by her husband. After the wife's
death, the husband executed a document that read as follows:

In consideration of my wife's promise to leave the rescuer $500, of the
rescuer's saving my wife's life, and of the rescuer's promise not to

259

assert any claim against the estate of my wife, I hereby promise to pay
the rescuer the sum of $500.

The husband died two months after signing the above agreement. The
rescuer submitted a claim for $500 to the administrator of the
husband's estate, but the administrator denied the claim.

Is the fact that the rescuer saved the wife's life sufficient consideration
for the husband's promise to pay him $500?

(A) Yes, because it is recited as consideration in the document that the

husband signed.

(B) Yes, because it materially benefited the husband.

(C) No, because the husband did not ask the rescuer to save his wife.

(D) No, because the value of the service rendered by the rescuer to the

husband was speculative.

34. A woman, who was dying, wanted to leave her house to her niece. The
woman's will left the house to her husband. Because the woman was
unlikely to live long enough for a new will to be drafted, her husband
promised her that if she kept the will the same, he would leave the
niece enough money in his will to make up for the niece not getting the
house. The woman died, and the husband failed to make any changes to
his will. The niece then sued his estate for the value of the house. Will
she recover?

(A) No, because she is not a creditor beneficiary of the agreement

between the wife and her husband.

(B) No, because a will speaks on death, and neither the wife nor the

husband ever changed theirs.

(C) Yes, because she was an intended beneficiary of the agreement

between the wife and her husband.

(D) Yes, because she was a donee beneficiary of the agreement

between the wife and her husband.

35. In preparation for an annual convention that was to be held on January
9, the buyer ordered 500 ballpoint pens from the seller at a total price
of $285, paying for them in advance. Because the pens were to be
given to conventioneers as souvenirs, they were to be imprinted with
the name and slogan of the association and were to be delivered to the

260

buyer on or before January 8. The seller and the buyer entered into a
written contract containing the above terms on November 16. The
seller tendered 475 ballpoint pens to the buyer on January 8.

Which of the following correctly states the legal relationship between
the buyer and the seller on January 8?

(A) The buyer must accept the tendered delivery of 475 pens but may
successfully sue for damages resulting from breach of contract.

(B) The buyer may elect to accept the tendered delivery of 475 pens but

may not successfully sue for breach of contract if it does so.

(C) The buyer may reject the tendered delivery of 475 pens but may
successfully sue only for the return of its advance payment if it
does so.

(D) The buyer may reject the tendered delivery of 475 pens and may
successfully sue for the return of its advance payment and for
damages resulting from breach of contract if it does so.

36. A man texted his friend, “I really want to sell my motorcycle. I would
consider $2,000 for it.” His friend immediately texted back, “I accept!
I'll give you a check immediately!” The friend then went to his bank
and had a cashier's check for $2,000 prepared. He also went out and
bought a motorcycle helmet, motorcycle leathers, and a shed in which
to store his new motorcycle. The next day when the friend showed up
for the motorcycle, the man refused to give it to him. If the friend sues
for specific performance, the court should find for

(A) the friend, because he accepted the man's offer.

(B) the friend, because he detrimentally relied on the man's offer.

(C) the man, because he merely made a statement of future intention.

(D) the man, because he was merely soliciting bids.

37. On June 1, the plaintiff, a licensed real estate broker, entered into a
written contract with the defendant. According to the contract, the
plaintiff was given the exclusive right to sell the defendant's home at a
price of $100,000 for a period of three months. The defendant agreed
to pay the plaintiff a 7 percent commission “upon transfer of title.” On
July 1, as a result of the plaintiff's efforts, a buyer agreed to purchase
the defendant's home at a price of $100,000. According to the terms of
the contract, the defendant was to deliver evidence of clear title prior

261

to July 20. At the defendant's request, an abstract company researched
the chain of title and delivered an abstract to the defendant on July 15
showing clear title. The defendant did not deliver the abstract to the
buyer, however, because his neighbor was unhappy with the prospect
of having the buyer move into the defendant's home and asked the
defendant to try to get out of the deal. On July 21, the buyer notified the
defendant that he would not go through with the transaction because of
the defendant's failure to deliver the abstract of title as agreed.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for a 7 percent commission based on
the defendant's contract with the buyer. Which of the following would
be the plaintiff's most effective argument in support of her claim?

(A) The plaintiff delivered a buyer “ready, willing, and able” to

purchase the defendant's property.

(B) But for a willful breach by the defendant, the buyer would have

taken title to the realty.

(C) The defendant and the buyer entered into a contract for the sale of

the defendant's realty as a result of the plaintiff's efforts.

(D) The defendant's refusal to deliver the abstract frustrated the

purpose of the contract between the defendant and the plaintiff.

38. The seller and the buyer entered into a written contract for the sale of

500 bicycles at a total price of $50,000. The contract required delivery
by the seller prior to June 1 and payment by the buyer within 30 days
after delivery. On May 15, the seller delivered the bicycles to the
buyer, who received and accepted them. On May 21, because the seller
was having cash flow problems, he telephoned the buyer, asking
whether the buyer could pay for the bicycles immediately. The buyer
said that he would pay by May 25 if the seller was willing to accept
$45,000 in cash as payment in full. The seller agreed, but by June 20,
the buyer had made no payment at all. The seller subsequently
instituted an action against the buyer for $50,000. The buyer admitted
the existence of the contract, the delivery of the bicycles, and his non-
payment; but he asserted that he was liable for only $45,000 because of
the agreement that he made with the seller on May 21.

Is the buyer's assertion correct?

(A) No, because the buyer did not pay $45,000 by May 25.

262

(B) No, because a promise to perform a preexisting obligation is not

valuable consideration.

(C) Yes, because there has been a valid novation.

(D) Yes, because there has been a valid agreement of accord.

39. A publisher mailed an offer to publish a writer's first book for

$25,000. The writer immediately mailed back her acceptance. The
acceptance was properly addressed with the correct amount of
postage. However, the post office lost the letter and the publisher never
received it. Is there a contract?

(A) No, because the post office lost the letter.

(B) No, because the publisher was excused from performance since he

did not receive the letter.

(C) Yes, because the acceptance was properly addressed with the

correct amount of postage.

(D) Yes, because the writer mailed her acceptance.

40. When the plaintiff was admitted to law school, her mother was so

proud of the plaintiff that she said, “If you successfully complete your
first year, I'll buy all your books for the following two years. In
addition, I'll give you $250 for every ‘A’ that you earn in your first
year.” The plaintiff made extra efforts to earn “A”s. The plaintiff's
mother died while the plaintiff was in her first year of law school, but
the plaintiff succeeded in earning two “A”s in her first year, and
completed school in two additional years. The plaintiff demanded that
her mother's executrix pay her $250 for each of the two “A”s that she
received in her first year, and pay for the books that she had purchased
in her second and third year, but the executrix refused.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the executrix for $500 for the
two “A”s that she received in her first year of law school, will the
plaintiff's claim be successful?

(A) No, because she was already obligated to use her best efforts while

in law school.

(B) No, because the plaintiff's mother died before the plaintiff received

the “A” grades.

(C) Yes, because prior to her mother's death, the plaintiff made extra

263

efforts in an attempt to earn “A”s.

(D) Yes, because the plaintiff got into law school.

41. In a transaction involving the sale of a bicycle, which of the following

persons is NOT a merchant under the UCC?

(A) The owner of a bicycle store who sells her own personal bicycle
after using it for 14 months by placing an advertisement under the
heading “Used Merchandise” in the classified section of the
newspaper.

(B) The owner of an automobile dealership who buys a bicycle for use
by employees of the dealership's parts department in making
deliveries.

(C) A bicycle mechanic who buys a new bicycle from a retail store to

give as a gift to his nephew.

(D) The owner of a messenger service who employs a full-time bicycle
mechanic to maintain bicycles used in her business, and who sends
the mechanic to inspect a new bicycle before buying it for use by
messengers in her employ.

42. The defendant was the owner and operator of a summer resort located
at a high elevation in the northern part of the country. Because the hotel
was open only during the summer, the defendant usually employed a
single resident caretaker to live and work at the hotel during the winter
months. On August 1, after applying for the job of winter caretaker, the
plaintiff entered into a valid written contract with the defendant.
According to its terms, the plaintiff was to take up residence at the
hotel on October 1, and to remain in residence until the following
April 1, at which time the defendant was to pay him $10,000. During
the plaintiff's period of residence, he was to receive free room and
board and to perform certain maintenance tasks. On August 15, the
plaintiff enlisted in the U.S. Navy, his period of service to begin on
September 25 and to continue for three years. Mention of the plaintiff's
enlistment appeared in the “Hometown Gossip” section of a local
newspaper and was seen by executives of the defendant. The defendant
immediately began seeking another winter caretaker and hired another
caretaker on September 15, entering into a valid written contract with
him on that date that contained terms identical to those in the contract
with the plaintiff.

264

On September 20, the plaintiff failed the physical examination
performed by Navy physicians and was rejected for naval service.
The plaintiff reported for work at the hotel on October 1 but was
advised that his services were not required.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from breach of contract, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, since he was ready, willing, and able to perform as

agreed on October 1.

(B) the plaintiff, since he never informed the defendant that he would

not be reporting to work as agreed.

(C) the defendant, since the plaintiff's enlistment was an anticipatory

repudiation of his contract with the defendant.

(D) the defendant, since the defendant hired another caretaker in

reliance on the reasonable belief that the plaintiff would be unable
to perform as agreed.

43. On May 1, the defendant hired the plaintiff to reshingle the roof of his
house at an agreed price of $5,000, to be paid within 10 days after
completion, and with all work to be completed by July 1. The plaintiff
began work on May 2 and worked diligently until May 15. At that time,
the plaintiff had performed services that were worth $1,500, and which
increased the value of the defendant's house by $1,500. On May 16,
through no fault of either party, the house caught fire and was totally
destroyed. Although the proceeds that the defendant received from his
fire insurance policy were sufficient to cover the cost of building a
new house, the defendant decided to sell the property instead. The
plaintiff demanded payment under the contract, but the defendant
refused to pay.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim for payment against the defendant, a
court should award judgment to the plaintiff in the sum of

(A) $5,000, since it was the price on which the plaintiff and the

defendant agreed.

(B) $1,500, since it was the value of the plaintiff's work.

(C) $0, since the defendant derived no benefit from the plaintiff's work.

(D) $5,000, because the defendant could have rebuilt the house with the

265

proceeds from the fire insurance policy.

44. At the age of 14, the plaintiff designed a program for a computer game.

He demonstrated the program to the defendant, a company in the
business of marketing computer software. The defendant executives
were so impressed by the program designed by the plaintiff that they
hired him as a game program consultant at a salary of $30,000 per
year. In addition, they offered to purchase marketing rights to the game
by a separate contract. According to the terms of the contract that they
offered, the defendant would have the exclusive rights to copy and
market the program for the game and would pay the plaintiff 30 percent
of all revenues derived from the exercise of those rights. After
consulting with his parents and their attorney, the plaintiff accepted the
defendant's offer and signed the contract. Three months later, before the
defendant had begun marketing the plaintiff's game program, the
plaintiff needed cash to purchase expensive computer equipment. For a
large cash payment, he assigned his rights under the contract to his
friend. His friend intended to inform the defendant of the assignment
but neglected to do so. One month later, the plaintiff assigned the same
rights to another software company as security for a credit purchase of
additional computer equipment. The other company was unaware of the
assignment to the plaintiff's friend and never notified the defendant that
the plaintiff had assigned the rights to it. Two months later, the
defendant began marketing the game, realizing high profits from its
sale. Although the plaintiff has demanded payment pursuant to the terms
of his contract, the defendant has refused to make any payments.

If the plaintiff commences an action against the defendant for royalties
equivalent to 30 percent of the revenues generated by the sale of the
game, which of the following would be the defendant's most effective
argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff was a minor at the time he contracted with the

defendant.

(B) The plaintiff has made at least one effective assignment of the

contract rights.

(C) Neither the friend nor the other company notified the defendant

about the assignment from the plaintiff.

(D) An assignment of wages is invalid.

45. A woman and her sister lived together in the woman's house in the

266

town of Wildwood. On March 1, the woman called her daughter on the
telephone and said that she was beginning to have premonitions of her
own death. The woman said that she was willing to deed her home to
her daughter while she was alive rather than put her daughter through
probate expenses. The woman said, however, that she would do so
only if her daughter agreed to permit her aunt to stay in the house for
the rest of her life and to permit her brother, who resided in another
state, to live in the house for as long as he wanted if he should ever
decide to come to Wildwood. The daughter promised to do so, and on
March 15, the woman deeded the home to her as agreed. At the time,
the home had a value of $100,000. The daughter called her brother on
March 10, and told him that their mother had deeded her the house but
did not tell him about her promise to allow her brother to live there.
On March 15, the aunt wrote to the brother:

“I don't think that either your mother or I have much longer to live, and
we both miss you terribly. If you agree to come and live here in
Wildwood for as long as either of us lives, I will leave you my entire
estate.

Love,

(signed)

On March 17, the brother called his sister and told her about the note
that he had received from their aunt. He said that he was thinking of
moving to Wildwood, and that if his sister promised to allow him to
live in the house that their mother had deeded to her until their aunt
died, he would give her 50 percent of the inheritance. The daughter
agreed, and her brother immediately wrote to their aunt, telling her that
he was moving to Wildwood in response to her offer. Their aunt
received the brother's letter on March 20. The brother made
arrangements to move to Wildwood, and did so, at an expense of
$800. Both their mother and their aunt died on March 22, but the
brother did not learn of their deaths until he arrived in Wildwood on
March 24. At that time, his sister refused to allow him to move into the
house.

The brother instituted an action against his sister for damages resulting
from her refusal to allow him to move into the house, and the only
defense asserted by the sister was that her promises were not in

267

writing. Which of the following would be the sister's most effective
argument in support of her position?

(A) Her promises to her mother and her brother were promises to

create an interest in land.

(B) It was possible that the promise that she made to her mother and her

brother would not be performed within a year.

(C) The house had a value in excess of $500.

(D) She received no consideration from her brother for either promise.

46. A painter entered into a contract to paint the homeowner's house for

$5,000. After painting the doors and the trim, the painter got a job offer
in a different state that he had to accept immediately or would lose. He
asked the homeowner if he could get out of the agreement, and the
homeowner, realizing the spot the painter was in, agreed. The painter
then asked if he could be paid for the amount of painting he did do. The
homeowner refused. Can the painter sue to recover the value of the
partial performance he rendered?

(A) No, because the painter was the one who requested to end the

agreement.

(B) No, because there was a mutual rescission of the contract.

(C) Yes, because the homeowner received value from the painter.

(D) Yes, because the painter was entitled to be paid for his part

performance.

47. The defendant, a manufacturer of widgets, entered into a valid written
contract that called for the sale of 2,000 widgets to the plaintiff at a
price of $10 per widget. Several weeks prior to the date set for
delivery, the defendant telephoned the plaintiff and advised her that
because of difficulty in locating a sufficient supply of frammis rods, the
defendant would be unable to deliver more than 1,000 widgets. After
discussion, the plaintiff agreed to accept 1,000 widgets at $10 per
widget instead of 2,000 as originally agreed. After the defendant
delivered 1,000 widgets, however, the plaintiff brought an action
against him for damages resulting from breach of contract. In
adjudicating the plaintiff's claim, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because her agreement to accept 1,000 widgets was

not in writing.

268

(B) the plaintiff, because her promise to accept 1,000 widgets was not

supported by consideration.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff agreed to accept 1,000 widgets.

(D) the defendant, because there has been an accord and satisfaction.

48. A man and the plaintiff were neighbors in a recently created

subdivision. Since both wanted to have landscaping work done, they
decided to join forces in hopes of getting a better price. They hired a
landscaper to plant grass and shrubs in their yards, directing him to bill
each of them for the labor and materials attributable to his separate
realty. After the landscaper completed the work, he submitted his bills
to the man and the plaintiff, who paid them immediately. The following
week, however, the man concluded that the landscaper had erroneously
billed him for some work done on the plaintiff's land. He showed his
calculations to the plaintiff, asking that the plaintiff reimburse him for
the amounts that he claimed to have paid on the plaintiff's account. The
plaintiff was certain that his neighbor was incorrect, but because he
did not want to come to bad terms with his new neighbor, he offered to
hire a gardener to keep the man's lawn mowed and trimmed for the next
two years. The man agreed to accept the offered services in lieu of
payment.

The plaintiff hired the defendant to maintain his lawn and the man's
lawn for the next two years, agreeing to pay him $50 per month for
certain specified services. The plaintiff and the defendant signed a
memorandum of agreement, and the plaintiff gave a photocopy of it to
his neighbor. Two months later, the plaintiff sold his house. At the
closing of title, the plaintiff handed the new homeowner the original
memorandum of his agreement with the defendant and executed an
assignment to the new homeowner of his rights thereunder. The
defendant continued rendering services as agreed for an additional six
months, receiving a check for $50 from the new homeowner each
month. Then, the defendant notified the man and the new homeowner
that he would no longer be able to work on their lawns. The man
wrote to the plaintiff and the new homeowner, demanding that they
make arrangements to have his lawn maintained for the remaining 16
months pursuant to his agreement with the plaintiff, but neither
responded.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for breaching their agreement

269

regarding maintenance of the lawns. Which one of the following facts
or inferences, if it were the only one true, would furnish the
defendant's most effective argument in defense against the plaintiff's
claim?

(A) There are equally competent gardening services in the area which,
for $50 per month, would perform work comparable to that which
the defendant agreed to perform.

(B) The value of labor and materials used in lawn maintenance has

increased dramatically since the signing of the memo.

(C) The agreement between the man and the plaintiff was oral.

(D) The defendant's inability to work on the lawns was the result of a
serious heart attack that led his doctors to advise him against ever
working again.

49. In response to an advertisement that he saw in the newspaper, the

homeowner telephoned the contractor and asked him to come to the
homeowner's home to estimate the cost of providing and installing new
aluminum screens for all the homeowner's windows. After taking
measurements, the contractor returned to his shop and prepared a
written estimate, in which he said that he would do the entire job for
$350. When the homeowner received the contractor's written estimate,
he wrote across it with a red felt-tipped pen, “I'll pay $300, but not a
penny more,” and mailed it to the contractor. When the contractor
received the estimate with the homeowner's statement written on it, he
wrote on the estimate, “I'll do it for $325.” He sent the estimate back to
the homeowner on September 5, but on September 12, having received
no response, he sent the homeowner a note that said, “All right, you
win. I'll do the job for $300. Unless I hear from you to the contrary, I'll
be there with the new screens on September 28. Signed, the
contractor.”

The homeowner received the note on September 14, but made no
response. On September 28, without the homeowner's knowledge and
while the homeowner was at work, the contractor went to the
homeowner's home and installed new aluminum window screens.

Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship
between the homeowner and the contractor AFTER installation of the
window screens on September 28?

270

(A) A contract was formed when the homeowner failed to respond to
the contractor's letter of September 12 within a reasonable time
after he received it.

(B) A contract was formed when the contractor began to install the

screens on September 28.

(C) A quasi-contract was formed when the contractor finished installing
the screens on September 28, obligating the homeowner to pay a
price equivalent to their reasonable value.

(D) No contractual relationship existed between the homeowner and the

contractor.

50. The defendant signed a five-year contract with the plaintiff. According

to the contract, the plaintiff would bag apples produced in the
defendant's orchard. There was a fixed price for each pound bagged,
with a minimum of 5,000 pounds to be bagged each year. A liquidated
damages clause provided that if the defendant requested less than the
5,000-pound minimum, the defendant would still pay the per-pound
bagging price for each pound by which the defendant's order was less
than the minimum. This was so regardless of whether the plaintiff was
required to do any work. In the second year, the defendant requested
significantly less than the 5,000-pound minimum of bagged apples. If
the plaintiff sues for breach and requests damages based on the
liquidated damages clause, the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the liquidated damages clause is a poor

estimate of actual losses.

(B) the defendant, because the liquidated damages clause was an

unenforceable penalty.

(C) the plaintiff, because the liquidated damages clause was a
reasonable estimation of damages under the contract.

(D) the plaintiff, because damages in this situation would be difficult to

calculate.

51 A woman knew that a local writer often gave private lessons in memoir
writing for $50 an hour. The market rate for such courses was closer to
$30 an hour, but the writer had already published two memoirs and
was somewhat famous. One day, the woman ran into the writer at the
grocery store. The woman told the writer how much she admired her
memoir writing. The writer then said, “I can come by your house

271

tomorrow to give you some lessons.” The woman said nothing. The
next day, the writer showed up at the woman's house and the two of
them worked on some of the woman's writing for an hour. For four
weeks, the writer showed up at the woman's house at the same time, on
the same day, and the two of them worked for an hour. At the end of the
month, the writer asked the woman to pay her. How much does the
woman owe?

(A) Nothing, because the woman never agreed to pay the writer.

(B) $120, the fair market value of the writer's lessons since the two of

them never had a formal agreement.

(C) Nothing, because by showing up at the woman's house, the writer

was making a gratuitous gift.

(D) $200, since this represented the writer's standard fee.

52. A boxer, the son of a poor family, grew up on his family's small farm
just outside of town. Despite the handicaps of poverty and lack of
education, the boxer eventually became the world's heavyweight
boxing champion. Proud of the boxer's accomplishments, the town
council voted to erect a statue commemorating the boxer's victory over
his social and economic disadvantages. Pursuant to town ordinances
and regulations, bids were accepted from several sculptors, including
the plaintiff. Because the plaintiff's work was relatively unknown, she
attempted to make her bid more attractive to the council by including a
guarantee that her work would be satisfactory. On February 1, the town
council entered into a written contract with the plaintiff, hiring her to
create the statue, and agreeing to pay her $5,000 upon its installation
on the steps of the town hall on or before June 30. A clause in the
contract provided, “It is expressly understood that the personal
satisfaction of the Mayor is a condition precedent to the council's
obligation to make payment hereunder. Upon completion of the statue,
it shall be made available for inspection by said mayor. If said mayor
is unsatisfied with the work, he shall notify the plaintiff immediately,
and the contract shall be canceled without liability of any party.”

The plaintiff sculpted a likeness of the boxer in farmer's overalls with
his hands in boxing gloves clasped victoriously over his head, which
she completed on June 10. The boxer had been arrested in another
state on May 30, however, and charged with possession of a
dangerous drug. His trial was scheduled for September 10. The town

272

council was fearful that the boxer would be convicted and that the
statue would embarrass the town.

The mayor went to the plaintiff's studio on June 11 after receiving
notice that the statue was ready for inspection. When he arrived, the
statue was covered with a canvas tarpaulin. When the plaintiff
removed the cover, the mayor said, “It's too small. The deal is off.”
The mayor truly believed the statue was too small, even though he was
also fearful of the conviction. The plaintiff subsequently demanded
that the town council pay for the statue, but the council refused. In an
action by the plaintiff against the town council, the court should find
for

(A) the plaintiff, because a reasonable person would have found the

plaintiff's work to be satisfactory.

(B) the plaintiff, because the mayor was fearful that the statue would

embarrass the town if the boxer was convicted.

(C) the town council, because the contract gave the mayor the absolute

right to reject the plaintiff's finished work.

(D) the town council, because the mayor actually believed that the

statue was too small.

53. The plaintiff worked for a corporation for 40 years. The corporation
told the plaintiff that the plaintiff would be given the right to retire at
any time with a lifetime pension. The plaintiff continued to work for a
few more years, then retired after downsizing her home so that her
expenses could be covered by the pension. She received the pension
for several years. After the founder of the corporation died, the
corporation stopped paying the pension. The plaintiff then sued. The
court should rule in favor of

(A) the plaintiff, because she chose to retire when she could have kept

on working.

(B) the plaintiff, because she received the pension in recognition of her

40 years of service.

(C) the plaintiff, because she worked for a few more years after

receiving the pension promise.

(D) the defendant, because there was no consideration supporting the

promise of the pension.

273

54. By a written contract, the plaintiff, the operator of a natural foods

store, agreed to purchase 200 pounds of large nuts from the defendant
at a specified price. A term of the contract provided that “payment
shall be due immediately on delivery and prior to inspection of the
shipment.” When a box containing the nuts was delivered, the plaintiff
paid the agreed price without inspecting its contents. One hour later,
the plaintiff opened the box and discovered that it contained small nuts
instead of large nuts. When the plaintiff telephoned the defendant to ask
that the defendant exchange the small nuts for large ones, the defendant
refused. The plaintiff repackaged the nuts and returned them to the
defendant. Subsequently, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the
defendant for breach of contract.

In considering the contract provision that required payment prior to
inspection, a court is most likely to hold that

(A) it is unconscionable and therefore not subject to enforcement.

(B) it constitutes a waiver of the buyer's right to inspect prior to

acceptance.

(C) it does not impair the buyer's right to inspect prior to acceptance.

(D) it was not enforceable when the contract was made, but since the

plaintiff did pay before inspecting the goods, he waived his right to
a preacceptance inspection.

55. The buyer and the seller were members of the graduating class of a
college. The buyer, who was planning to go to law school, told the
seller that he might need some law books. The seller had recently
inherited a law library, so he compiled a list of the books in the
collection and mailed it to the buyer on July 5 with a note that said,
“Interested in buying?” The buyer wrote the following letter on a copy
of the booklist and mailed it to the seller on Tuesday, July 8:

Dear seller,

I  will  buy  your  law  library  consisting  of  the  books  on  this  list  for
$2,600  cash  if  you  deliver  the  books  to  my  home  by  the  time  I  start
law  school  in  mid-September.  I  promise  to  hold  this  offer  open  until
September 1.

Yours truly,

274

[signed] the buyer

In the buyer's letter of July 8, what was the legal effect of the
statement, “I promise to hold this offer open until September 1”?

(A) The language did not prevent the buyer from revoking the offer.

(B) At common law, the language creates an irrevocable option in the

seller's favor.

(C) Under the UCC, the buyer was prevented from revoking the offer

until September 1.

(D) The language created an option in favor of the seller, subject to the

condition that the buyer actually begin law school.

56. Which of the following is most likely to be regarded as valid

consideration for a man's oral promise to pay his neighbor $1,000?

(A) The fact that his neighbor had saved the man's house from a fire the

day before the man's promise was made.

(B) The fact that at the same time the man made the promise to pay, his
neighbor promised to deliver to the man fire-fighting equipment
valued at $1,000.

(C) The fact that after the man made the promise, his neighbor relied
upon it by committing himself to the purchase of fire-fighting
equipment at a price of $1,000.

(D) The fact that immediately after the man made the promise, his

neighbor sent the man a written memorandum of their agreement, to
which the man did not object within 30 days.

57. An airline agreed to buy all of its jet fuel requirements from a jet-fuel
supplier. The supplier committed to supply those requirements at a
price pegged to the industry-wide posted price for crude oil. Then,
because of a war, the price increased dramatically. The supplier
reneged on the agreement. The airline sued. The court should rule in
favor of

(A) the supplier, because the war was not foreseeable at the time of

contracting.

(B) the supplier, because the plaintiff was not bound to buy any goods

at all.

275

(C) the airline, because it bound itself to act reasonably and in good

faith in estimating the quantity of fuel it required.

(D) the airline, because a mere price increase would not invalidate the

agreement.

58. After the commercial success of a rock music group, its lead singer

entered into a contract with the defendant. According to its terms, the
singer, singing alone, was to record a song for the defendant. The
defendant was to pay $2,000 to the singer 30 days after the record was
made, whether or not it was ever commercially released. If the record
was released, the singer was to receive additional compensation
depending on the number of copies of the record that were sold.

The singer made the record required by the contract on March 1. On
March 15, the singer bought a piano, promising to pay for it when he
received payment from the defendant. As security for his promise, the
singer assigned to the piano seller his right to collect the $2,000 that
the defendant owed him for making the record. The piano seller
immediately notified the defendant of the assignment. On April 1, the
singer purported to assign the same right to his landlord to induce him
to refrain from instituting eviction proceedings based on non-payment
of rent. The landlord immediately notified the defendant of the
assignment. On April 20, the singer sued the defendant for non-
payment of the $2,000.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it were the
only true, would be most likely to result in a judgment for the
defendant?

(A) The singer was an infant at the time of all the transactions

described above.

(B) The singer made at least one effective assignment of the right to

collect the $2,000.

(C) The singer's performance at the March 1 recording session was so

bad that the record can never be commercially released.

(D) A statute in the jurisdiction prohibited the assignment of future

wages by employees.

59. In an agreement made on April 15, the plaintiff agreed to design a coat
of arms for the defendant and to fabricate a wooden door with the coat

276

of arms carved into it for the front of the defendant's home. The
defendant agreed to pay $650 for the door, but it was understood that if
the defendant was not completely satisfied with the coat of arms and
the door, he would be under no obligation to go through with the deal.
Before the plaintiff completed the door, the defendant came to the
conclusion that he did not really want a coat of arms. When the plaintiff
brought the finished door to the defendant, the defendant took a quick
glance at it. Although the coat of arms was properly designed and
carved, and although the door had been fabricated in a workmanlike
manner, the defendant said, “I just don't like it,” and refused to accept
it.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant, which of the
following would be the defendant's best defense?

(A) The agreement was not in writing as required by the Statute of

Frauds.

(B) The agreement was an offer for a unilateral contract that the

defendant rejected by refusing to accept the finished door.

(C) The defendant's subjective satisfaction was a condition precedent

to his obligation to accept the door.

(D) Since the coat of arms was not yet associated with the defendant, it

was possible for the plaintiff to find another buyer for it.

60. Because its property was filling up with a lot of unwanted recycled
plastic it didn't want to pay to have removed, a landfill gave a
construction firm free recycled plastic for use in its construction work.
All the firm had to do was come to the landfill and pick it up. The
plastic turned out to be defective, and the firm sued the landfill for
breach of contract. The landfill argued that there were no contractual
obligations to the firm because any promise it made was not supported
by consideration. The landfill argued it had merely made a gift of the
plastic on the condition that the firm come and pick it up. Can the firm
successfully sue for breach of contract?

(A) Yes, because the firm relied on the 
landfill's promise to its detriment.

(B) Yes, because the landfill wanted the firm to take the plastic and

benefited when it did so.

(C) No, because the landfill did not bargain for the firm's performance.

277

(D) No, because the unwanted plastic was a gift.

61. When the buyer's employer prepared to transfer him to its plant located
in Twin Oaks, the buyer contracted with the seller for the purchase of
the seller's home located in Twin Oaks. According to the contract, title
was to close and the home was to be vacant and ready for occupancy
by the buyer no later than April 20. Because the buyer was arranging to
move his family to Twin Oaks on April 20, at the buyer's insistence the
contract contained a liquidated damages clause. The clause provided
that if the house was not ready for occupancy on April 20, the seller
would pay the buyer $75 for each day thereafter that it remained
unavailable for occupancy. When the buyer and his family moved to
Twin Oaks on April 20, the home was not ready for occupancy. As a
result, the buyer and his family had to stay at a motel. On May 1, the
seller advised the buyer that he did not intend to go through with the
sale of this house. On May 10, the buyer instituted an action against the
seller for specific performance and damages.

With respect to the buyer's demand for specific performance, a court

(A) may find for the buyer, whether or not the liquidated damages

clause is held to be enforceable.

(B) may find for the buyer, because the liquidated damages clause is

unenforceable.

(C) may find for the buyer, because the liquidated damages clause is

enforceable.

(D) must find for the seller.

62. On June 11, the homeowner asked a local handyman whether the

handyman would be interested in painting the homeowner's house.
Following their conversation, they entered into the following
handwritten agreement, which the handyman wrote on the back of an
old envelope and which both signed:

The  homeowner  and  the  handyman  hereby  agree  that  the  handyman
will  paint  the  outside  of  the  homeowner's  house  for  $700  as  follows:
wood trim brown; doors and window frames green; siding yellow (two
coats).

The handyman painted the siding yellow and gave it two coats of
paint. He painted the wood trim brown and the doors and window

278

frames green, but gave them only one coat of paint. The homeowner
refused to pay unless the handyman gave the wood trim, doors, and
window frames a second coat. The handyman instituted an action
against the homeowner for $700. At the trial, the homeowner
attempted to testify that prior to executing the agreement, he and the
handyman agreed orally that the handyman would apply two coats of
paint to the wood trim, doors, and window frames, as well as to the
siding.

The trial judge should rule the homeowner's testimony

(A) admissible only for the purpose of establishing that the phrase

“(two coats)” is ambiguous.

(B) admissible for the purpose of establishing that the phrase “(two

coats)” is ambiguous and for the additional purpose of explaining
the ambiguity.

(C) admissible, because the agreement was written by the handyman.

(D) inadmissible, since the writing was a complete expression of the

agreement of the parties.

63. A man, who had been studying the writings of various mystical

philosophers, decided to sell all his worldly possessions, give the
money to charity, and wander about in the desert for a while to seek
insight and spiritual fulfillment. After about a month in the desert, the
man became ill and collapsed into unconsciousness. When he woke, he
was in the home of a retired surgeon who now lived like a hermit in the
desert, and who had found him in a helpless condition. As the doctor
fed soup to the man, the man said, “I have no money. I can never pay
you for any of this.” The doctor replied, “I'm not doing this for money.”

During the next week, the doctor fed the man and gave him medical
treatment. When the man was well enough to travel, the doctor
borrowed an old pickup truck from a distant neighbor and drove the
man to the house of the man's mother. The following week, after the
man told his mother what the doctor did for him, the man's mother
wrote the doctor: “In gratitude for the services that you rendered my
son, I hereby promise to pay you $350.00 when I get my dividend
check next month.” Before the dividend check arrived, however, both
the man's mother and the doctor died. The plaintiff, the doctor's
administrator, advised the mother's husband of the letter that his wife

279

had sent and indicated that he intended to make a claim against her
estate for $350.

After a discussion with the plaintiff, in which the plaintiff agreed not
to assert a claim against the mother's estate, the husband prepared a
document that read, “In consideration of services rendered by the
doctor to my wife's son, and of the plaintiff's promise to make no
claim against the estate of my wife, I hereby agree to pay $350.00 to
the doctor's estate.” After signing the document, the husband handed it
to the plaintiff. The husband never paid anything to the estate,
however, and the plaintiff instituted suit against him. The husband
defended on the ground that his promise to pay $350 was not
supported by consideration.

If the plaintiff's lawsuit against the mother's husband is successful, it
will most likely be for which of the following reasons?

(A) The document that the husband executed was an offer for a

unilateral contract that the plaintiff accepted by not making a claim
against the mother's estate.

(B) A judgment for the husband would result in his being unjustly

enriched.

(C) The husband is estopped from denying the validity of his agreement

with the plaintiff.

(D) The husband's agreement with the plaintiff was a compromise.

64. On September 10, the company, a well-known publisher of law books,
posted the following notice on the bulletin board at a law school:

As  an  incentive  to  research  and  scholastic  excellence,  the  company
announces  the  institution  of  an  award.  The  award  will  consist  of  a
complete set of the company's encyclopedias and will be presented to
the  student  in  each  graduating  class  of  the  law  school  who  attains  the
highest  overall  cumulative  Grade  Point  Average.  In  the  event  two  or
more  students  graduate  with  the  same  Grade  Point  Average,  the  dean
will  be  asked  to  select  the  winner  from  among  them  based  on  school
service and community involvement.

A student, who had just begun her final year at the law school, saw the
notice. Her grades already placed her toward the top of her class, but
she resolved to work harder than ever before in an attempt to win the

280

company's award. On September 20, she mailed a letter to the
company saying, “I accept your offer for the award and will do my
best to win it.” Her letter was received by the company, but it was lost
in the mailroom before any company officials had an opportunity to
see it.

Which of the following statements is most correct about the company's
notice?

(A) It was an offer for a unilateral contact.

(B) It was an offer for a bilateral contract.

(C) It was an offer for either a unilateral contract or a bilateral contract

at the offeree's option.

(D) It was an offer for a unilateral contract that ripened into a bilateral
contract when the student achieved the highest grade point average
in her class.

65. The defendant's 20-year-old son became ill while traveling. The

plaintiff, a youth hostel operator, let the son stay in one of the hostel's
rooms and nursed the son back to health. The plaintiff contacted the
defendant, who thanked the plaintiff and promised to pay the plaintiff
for any of his expenses. The plaintiff then sent the defendant a bill. The
defendant refused to pay. What result?

(A) There was an enforceable contract based on the plaintiff's promise

to pay the defendant's expenses.

(B) There was no enforceable contract because the defendant's promise

was not supported by consideration.

(C) There was an enforceable contract because the plaintiff

detrimentally relied on the defendant's promise.

(D) There was no enforceable contract because the plaintiff had a

moral obligation to give aid to the son.

66. The plaintiff was a manufacturer of sewing supplies, including thread,

needles, thimbles, and patterns. The defendant was an engineer
employed by the plaintiff in its product design department. Working at
home on his days off, the defendant invented a device that could be
used to increase the fuel efficiency of automobile engines. Without
telling his employer anything about it, the defendant obtained a patent
on the device and sold the patent rights for $100,000 to a motor vehicle

281

manufacturer. The plaintiff subsequently learned about the defendant's
invention and demanded the money that the defendant had received
from the manufacturer. In support of its demand, the plaintiff referred to
a provision of the defendant's employment contract that required him to
devote all his working time and energies to his employment. The
plaintiff's attorneys argued that because of this provision, the device
had been invented on company time, and that the patent rights therefore
belonged to the plaintiff. At a conference with the plaintiff's attorneys,
the defendant signed a promissory note for $50,000, payable to the
plaintiff, and the plaintiff agreed to abandon its claim. When the note
came due, the defendant refused to pay it.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant on the promissory
note, which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was
the only one true, would be most helpful to the defendant's defense?

(A) The employment contract was oral, although the Statute of Frauds

required it to be in writing.

(B) At the time the defendant signed the promissory note, the plaintiff

did not honestly believe that it was entitled to the patent rights, but
the defendant believed that the plaintiff was entitled to the patent
rights.

(C) At the time the defendant signed the promissory note, the plaintiff

honestly believed that it was entitled to the patent rights, but the
defendant did not believe that the plaintiff was entitled to the patent
rights.

(D) The plaintiff was not entitled to the patent rights under the

employment contract.

67. The plaintiff was a manufacturer of wood-finishing products with a

plant in the city. The defendant was a manufacturer of wooden furniture
with a factory located in the town. Pursuant to a written agreement, the
defendant agreed to purchase 50 gallons of wood stain from the
plaintiff at $5 per gallon, “FOB the defendant's factory.” The plaintiff
delivered the wood stain to a trucking company that loaded it safely
onto a truck in the city. While en route to the town, however, the truck
was hijacked by thieves. Its contents were never recovered.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for the agreed price
of the stain, which of the following comments is most correct?

282

(A) The plaintiff fulfilled her obligation to the defendant when the stain

was loaded safely aboard a truck in the city.

(B) The risk of loss passed to the defendant when the plaintiff

delivered the stain to the trucking company, although title to the
stain never actually passed to the defendant.

(C) The risk of loss did not pass to the defendant.

(D) The risk of loss was not on the plaintiff, since the loss was the

result of action by the public enemy.

68. When a landowner's daughter and a painting contractor's son

announced that they were getting married, the landowner and the
contractor decided to give them a house as a wedding present. On
January 1, the two men entered into a written agreement with each
other, pursuant to which they were to have a house built on the
landowner's lot, with the landowner and the contractor each paying
half the cost. It was further agreed that after completion of the house,
the contractor would pay the landowner $10,000 as his share of the
cost of the lot, and the landowner would convey the lot to their
children.

On February 2, the two men entered into a written contract with the
plaintiff, a builder. The contract called for payment in installments,
each payment being due upon completion of a specified stage of
building. In addition to its other terms, the contract contained a clause
providing that as each payment came due, the plaintiff would bill and
collect half of it from the landowner and half of it from the contractor.
In the contract, the plaintiff agreed that neither would be responsible to
him for more than half of the price.

On March 3, the contractor entered into a separate contract with the
plaintiff. Pursuant to this contract, the plaintiff hired the contractor as a
subcontractor to do all the painting required in connection with the
construction of the house. Because the house was being built for his
son, the contractor agreed to do the job for $3,000 although his work
was worth $5,000. The $3,000 was to be deducted from the final
payment that the contractor would owe the plaintiff for construction of
the house.

In April, the contractor became ill. Because he could no longer work,
he sold his painting business to his son, a competent and licensed

283

painting contractor, for about half of what it was actually worth. As
one of the terms of the contract of sale, the contractor's son promised
to do all the painting work on the house that the plaintiff was
constructing. The contractor notified the plaintiff of his agreement with
his son. When the house was ready to be painted, however, the
contractor's son informed the plaintiff that he would not paint it.

The plaintiff hired another painting subcontractor to do the job at a
price of $5,000 and asserted a claim for breach of contract against the
contractor's son. If there was an enforceable contract between the
contractor and his son, the court should find for

(A) the contractor's son, because there was no privity between the

plaintiff and him.

(B) the contractor's son, because a contract for personal services is not

assignable.

(C) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff was an intended donee

beneficiary of the contract between the contractor and his son.

(D) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff was an intended creditor

beneficiary of the contract between the contractor and his son.

69. The seller and the buyer had been friends for years. The seller was the
owner of a rare antique sports car, which the buyer had offered to buy
from her on several occasions but which the seller had never been
willing to sell. On the buyer's birthday, the seller and the buyer went
out for dinner and drinks. After dinner, the seller continued drinking
until she was somewhat intoxicated. During their conversation, the
seller said, “As a birthday present, I've decided that I'm going to sell
you my sports car for $500. And just to make sure that I don't change
my mind after I sober up, I'll put it in writing.” With that, she wrote on
a paper napkin, “We agree to the sale of my sports car to the buyer for
$500, COD,” and signed her name at the bottom. The buyer also signed
the napkin and put it in her purse. The following day, the buyer
tendered $500 in cash to the seller, but the seller refused to sell her the
car, claiming that she had been drunk when she made the offer.

In an action by the buyer against the seller for breach of contract,
which of the following additional facts, if it was the only one true,
would be most helpful to the seller's defense?

(A) The seller was so drunk when she wrote on the napkin that she did

284

not know the legal consequences of her act.

(B) The seller would not have offered to sell the car to the buyer for

$500 if she had not been drunk.

(C) The car was worth more than $500.

(D) The seller changed her mind about selling the car before the buyer

tendered the cash.

70. The defendant was the owner and operator of a store that sold exotic

birds and aviary supplies. The plaintiff was the owner and operator of
a pet shop in which dogs, cats, tropical fish, and exotic birds were
sold. The defendant kept a trained Amazon parrot on a perch near the
sales counter in his store. The bird had an extensive vocabulary and
did tricks on his perch to the great amusement of the defendant's
customers. The plaintiff wished to have the parrot for his own personal
pet and had attempted to purchase him from the defendant on numerous
occasions, but the defendant always indicated that he was unwilling to
sell. On January 5, the plaintiff again asked the defendant if he would
sell the parrot, to which the defendant replied, “I'd consider selling
him to you, but I don't even know what a bird with this parrot's training
is worth.” The plaintiff said that he would do some research to find
out, if the defendant would promise to seriously consider selling the
parrot for whatever they found the proper price to be. Based on their
conversation, the plaintiff and the defendant executed the following
document:

The defendant hereby agrees to sell to the plaintiff one trained Amazon
parrot for a price to be paid in cash and on delivery, said price to be
agreed upon after determining the reasonable value of a bird with the
parrot's training.

The plaintiff contacted five generally acknowledged experts in trained
exotic birds and received opinions from them regarding the parrot's
value that ranged from $700 to $1,000. When the plaintiff attempted to
buy the parrot from the defendant for $1,000, however, the defendant
indicated that he was unwilling to sell the parrot at any price.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for specific
performance of the agreement made on January 5, the plaintiff will

(A) win, because he offered to pay $1,000 for the parrot.

285

(B) win, but he will be required to pay a price for the parrot that the
trier of fact finds to be reasonable in light of expert and other
evidence presented at the trial.

(C) lose, since the January 5 document does not manifest an intent to be

bound.

(D) lose, since specific performance is not available in an action for

breach of a contract for the sale of a chattel.

71. The plaintiff was the owner of an air-conditioning repair company. His
employees did all the repair jobs, but the plaintiff himself did the
estimating and made price quotes to customers. The plaintiff
maintained a fleet of pickup trucks for use by his employees when
traveling to and from repair jobs, but the plaintiff usually drove his
own personal station wagon when going out to give a potential
customer an estimate.

On February 15, the plaintiff ordered a new station wagon from the
defendant, a new-car dealer. Prior to signing the sales contract, the
salesperson who sold him the car explained that the new car could be
obtained by the defendant only from the manufacturer. For this reason,
she said, it might be as long as two weeks before the defendant could
deliver the new car to the plaintiff. The plaintiff said that this would
be all right, but that he definitely needed the car by March 10 for use
in his business. Based on this discussion, it was agreed that the new
car would be ready for him no later than March 5.

Immediately following the signing of the sales contract by the plaintiff
and the defendant, the salesperson contacted the manufacturer's sales
department and placed the order for the plaintiff's car. She explained
to the sales representative at the manufacturer that she had contracted
to deliver the car to the plaintiff no later than March 5, and that if she
was unable to do so, she would probably lose the sale. The sales
representative assured her that the car would be delivered on time.

On March 4, the plaintiff sold his old station wagon because he
believed that he would be receiving the new one the following day.
The manufacturer failed to deliver the new car to the defendant until
March 30, making it impossible for the defendant to deliver it to the
plaintiff on time.

286

The plaintiff instituted an action for breach of contract against the
defendant, and he alleged damages that included lost profits resulting
from his inability to travel to the premises of potential customers for
the purpose of estimating jobs and selling his company's services.
Which of the following would be the defendant's most effective
argument in response to that allegation?

(A) At the time the contract was formed, it was not foreseeable that late

delivery of the automobile would result in business losses.

(B) Late delivery by the manufacturer made performance of the sales

contract by the defendant impossible.

(C) The plaintiff could have mitigated damages by renting another

vehicle or using one of the company pickup trucks while waiting
for delivery of the station wagon.

(D) Consequential damages are not available for the breach of a

contract of sale.

72. A licensed physician was driving home from the hospital where she
worked when she saw a pedestrian fall unconscious to the pavement.
The doctor stopped her car, examined the pedestrian, and diagnosed
that he was experiencing cardiac arrest. After attempting to render
medical treatment, the doctor carried the pedestrian to her car and
drove him to the hospital. There, she continued attempting to treat him
for an hour, after which the pedestrian died without ever having
regained consciousness. At the time she assisted the pedestrian, the
doctor reasonably expected to be compensated for her services. The
doctor subsequently sent the administratrix of the pedestrian's estate a
bill for medical services, but the administratrix refused to pay it.

The jurisdiction had a “Good Samaritan” statute. If the doctor asserts a
claim against the pedestrian's administratrix for the reasonable value
of her medical services, the court should find for

(A) the doctor, because at the time she assisted the pedestrian, she
reasonably expected to be compensated for her services.

(B) the doctor, because a contract was implied-in-fact.

(C) the pedestrian's administratrix, because the pedestrian received no

benefit as a result of the doctor's services.

(D) the pedestrian's administratrix, because the jurisdiction has a

287

“Good Samaritan” statute.

73. The plaintiff was a professional gambler who made his living by
accepting illegal bets on horse races and other sporting events.
Because he suspected that the police had discovered his operation, he
began looking for a new location for his illegal activities. Finding an
empty storefront building on Main Street, he contacted the defendant,
its owner. On December 12, they entered into a lease of the premises
for a six-month period. According to the lease, the plaintiff's
occupancy was to begin on the first of January, at a rent of $200 per
month. The plaintiff paid the first month's rent upon signing the lease.

On December 17, the plaintiff was arrested on charges of illegal
bookmaking. He pleaded guilty and received a nine-month sentence.
The following day, his attorney advised the defendant that the plaintiff
would not be moving into the leased premises after all. The defendant
agreed to release the plaintiff from the lease and immediately rented
the premises to another tenant for $300 per month, occupancy to begin
on December 20. When the plaintiff was released from prison nine
months later, he demanded that the defendant return his $200. The
defendant refused on the ground that the contract that the plaintiff had
made with her had an illegal purpose.

If the plaintiff institutes an action against the defendant, a court should
find for

(A) the defendant, since the courts will not aid either party to an illegal

contract.

(B) the defendant, since she and the plaintiff were not in pari delicto

regarding the illegality of the lease agreement.

(C) the plaintiff, since the lease agreement was not illegal.

(D) the plaintiff, since his sentence to serve nine months in prison made

performance by him impossible as a matter of law.

74. The defendant, an 84-year-old woman, suffered from Parkinson's
disease. She asked the plaintiff, a woman who rented space in her
home, to quit her job so she could care for the defendant. The plaintiff
agreed and quit her job in return for the defendant's promise that when
the defendant died she would leave the house and surrounding farm to
the plaintiff. Three days after the agreement was made, the defendant
made an appointment to see her lawyer to change her will. However,

288

before she could keep the appointment, she fell ill and was
hospitalized. The plaintiff spent a lot of time with her at the hospital,
but a few days later, the defendant died. The plaintiff sued the
defendant's estate for specific performance of the promise to convey
the house and farm. The court should rule in favor of

(A) the plaintiff, because she gave up her employment and agreed to

take care of the defendant.

(B) the plaintiff, because the defendant showed her intent to honor the

agreement by making the appointment with her lawyer.

(C) the defendant's estate, because the house and farm are worth much

more than the services actually performed by the plaintiff.

(D) the defendant's estate, because a will speaks at death.

75. The buyer received an advertising brochure from the seller in the mail.
The brochure contained a photograph of a computer, and above it the
statement, “While they last. All computers on sale at 25 percent below
manufacturer's list price.” The buyer immediately contacted the
company that manufactured the computer pictured in the seller's
brochure and determined that the manufacturer's list price for the 410
was $1,000. She then sent her check for $750 ($1,000 less 25 percent)
to the seller with a cover letter that stated, “I hereby accept your offer
for the sale of a computer. My check is enclosed herewith.” The seller
threw the buyer's letter and check away.

The brochure that the seller sent the buyer is best described as

(A) an invitation for offers.

(B) an invitation for offers that ripened into an offer when the buyer

learned the list price for the computer.

(C) an invitation for offers that ripened into an offer when the buyer

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

relied on it by sending her check and cover letter.

(D) an offer for the sale of a computer.

76. A group of workmen signed contracts at a fixed rate to work on a ship
during the salmon-canning season, as the ship went from San Francisco
to Alaska and back. When the ship arrived in Alaska, the workmen told
the captain that they would not do any more work unless the captain
gave them a very substantial increase in salary. Since the captain had
nowhere to go to get replacement men, he agreed. The workmen then

289

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

worked on the way back to San Francisco. When the captain refused to
pay the extra money, the workmen sued. The court should rule in favor
of

(A) the workmen, because they relied on the captain's promise of an

increased salary.

(B) the workmen, because parties can renegotiate a contract based on a

change in conditions.

(C) the captain, because he agreed to the salary increase while under

duress.

(D) the captain, because the workmen had a pre-existing duty to work

on the way back to San Francisco.

77. The seller was the owner of a lot and building that contained two

residential apartments. The seller resided in the upstairs apartment and
rented the downstairs apartment to a tenant and his family on a month-
to-month basis. The buyer was interested in purchasing the realty from
the seller. After negotiations, the buyer and the seller entered into a
written contract that provided that the seller would sell the house to the
buyer for $60,000 and that delivery of title was to occur on or before
August 1. The seller promised that at the time title was delivered, the
upstairs apartment would be vacant and that the downstairs apartment
would be vacant within three months thereafter. The buyer promised to
pay $58,000 upon delivery of title, and the balance of $2,000 three
months after delivery of title. The contract provided that “The buyer's
obligation to pay $2,000 three months after delivery of title shall be
voided if the downstairs apartment has not been vacated by that time.”

Which of the following statements concerning the order of
performances is LEAST accurate?

(A) The seller's delivery of title on or before August 1 and the buyer's

payment of $58,000 are concurrent obligations.

(B) Vacancy of the upstairs apartment is a condition precedent to the

buyer's obligation to pay $58,000 upon delivery of title.

(C) Payment by the buyer of $58,000 is a condition precedent to the

seller's obligation to deliver title to the premises.

(D) Payment by the buyer of $2,000 is a condition subsequent to the

seller's obligation to have the downstairs apartment vacated within

290

three months after the delivery of title.

78. Article 2 of the UCC applies

(A) only to transactions in goods.

(B) only to transactions involving merchants.

(C) to all commercial transactions.

(D) only to transactions in goods or services.

79. After seeing the small airplane that the pilot was flying go down in

stormy seas, the pilot's wife stood on the shore screaming, “Oh, God,
won't somebody please save my husband?” Upon hearing her appeal
for help, the plaintiff went out in his rowboat and succeeded in
rescuing the pilot. The plaintiff subsequently asked the pilot's wife to
pay him for his trouble, but she refused.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim for payment against the pilot's wife on a
theory of promissory estoppel, which of the following would be the
pilot's wife's most effective argument in defense?

(A) The plaintiff was an officious intermeddler.

(B) The value of the pilot's life is too speculative.

(C) No promise of payment can be reasonably inferred from the wife's

cry for help.

(D) There was no consideration for the wife's promise.

80. The buyer was a collector of antiques who had purchased many

expensive pieces from the seller, an antiques dealer. Knowing that the
seller was traveling to Europe, the buyer wrote to him on March 11, “If
you should come across a good piece in your travels, please purchase
it for me. I don't care about the cost.”

On April 17, the seller wrote to the buyer, “I have found an excellent
settee. The price is $15,000, but I think it's a good buy. Are you still
interested? If so, let me know if the price is acceptable to you.”

The buyer received the seller's letter on April 21, and, on that same
day, texted the seller, “Fifteen thousand is OK. Buy the piece on my
account.”

Soon thereafter, the seller sold the piece to another collector who

291

offered more money.

In litigation between the buyer and the seller, if a court determines that
the seller's letter of April 17 was not an offer, it will most likely be
because that letter

(A) was an acceptance of the offer contained in the buyer's letter of

March 11.

(B) did not specify the terms of payment.

(C) did not manifest a willingness to be bound.

(D) did not specify a manner of acceptance.

81. The defendant, who resided in the city, was the owner of a chain of dry
cleaning stores. Because his stores had been financially successful, he
began selling franchises. By the terms of his franchise agreements, the
defendant permitted franchisees to use the name of his store in return
for an initial fee of $50,000 and 10 percent of the gross revenues.

The plaintiff lived in a distant state. When she heard about the
financial success of the stores, she wrote to the defendant, asking him
to sell her a franchise to operate a dry cleaning store in her state.
Because the defendant had great affection for the plaintiff and wanted
her to live near him, he sent her a letter in which he said, “If you will
come and live here, I will give you a franchise to operate in the city
without any initial fee. All you will have to pay is 10 percent of the
gross revenues.”

The plaintiff immediately wrote the defendant to tell him that she was
coming to live in the city as he requested, and that she was looking
forward to operating a store there. After the plaintiff moved to the city,
however, the defendant told her that his contract with another
franchisee prevented him from giving her a franchise to operate a store
in the city.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for breach of
contract, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, on a theory of bargained-for exchange.

(B) the plaintiff, because she detrimentally relied on the promise made

by the defendant.

292

(C) the defendant, because his promise was for a conditional gift.

(D) the defendant, because his affection for the plaintiff is not sufficient

to support his promise to her.

82. The seller is a manufacturer of wall-coverings that he ordinarily sells
to retailers in boxes containing 10 packages per box. By a valid
written contract, the buyer agreed to purchase, and the seller agreed to
sell, 10 boxes of 107-Blue. When the boxes arrived, the buyer
inspected them and found that 2 of the boxes contained 109-Red
instead of 107-Blue. The buyer immediately notified the seller, who
informed the buyer that he no longer produced 107-Blue and had sent
the buyer his last 8 boxes. The seller said that he had sent 2 boxes of
109-Red as an accommodation, and that the buyer did not have to
accept them unless he wanted to.

Which of the following correctly states the buyer's rights regarding the
shipment?

(A) The buyer may reject the entire shipment.

(B) The buyer may reject the entire shipment, or accept the 8 boxes
containing 107-Blue and reject the 2 boxes containing 109-Red.

(C) The buyer may accept the 8 boxes containing 107-Blue and reject
the 2 boxes containing 109-Red, or accept the entire shipment and
collect damages resulting from its nonconformity to the terms of the
contract.

(D) The buyer may reject the entire shipment, accept the 8 boxes

containing 107-Blue and reject the 2 boxes containing 109-Red, or
accept the entire shipment and collect damages resulting from its
nonconformity to the terms of the contract.

83. By a valid written contract formed on May 7, the builder agreed to

construct a warehouse for the landowner. Pursuant to the terms of the
contract, the building was to be completed no later than November 30.
The agreed price was $60,000, of which the landowner was to pay
$20,000 when the construction was 50 percent complete and the
balance upon completion. The builder began work on May 11 and had
completed 25 percent of the construction by June 5, when the partially
finished structure was struck by lightning and completely destroyed in
the resulting fire. No payment had yet been made by the landowner to
the builder. On June 7, the builder notified the landowner that he was

293

too busy to rebuild the structure and that he would not continue to work
on the project. The landowner subsequently hired another contractor to
build the warehouse at a lower price and rejected all the builder's
demands for payment. If the builder asserts a claim against the
landowner, the builder is entitled to recover

(A) the difference between $60,000 and the price that the landowner

paid to have the warehouse built by another contractor.

(B) the reasonable value of the work performed by the builder prior to

the destruction of the structure by lightning and fire.

(C) 25 percent of $60,000 ($15,000).

(D) nothing.

84. When the defendant's employers transferred him to the West Coast, they
promised to pay all his relocation expenses, including any commission
that he might have to pay for the sale of his home. The defendant
contacted the plaintiff, a real estate broker, and entered into a written
contract with her on September 1. Under its terms, the defendant
agreed that if the house was sold to any buyer who made an offer
during the following two months, he would pay the plaintiff upon the
closing of title a commission equivalent to 6 percent of the actual
selling price of the house. In return, the plaintiff agreed to make
reasonable efforts to find a buyer for the house at a price of $80,000.

On September 15, after the plaintiff showed the defendant's home to
the buyer, the buyer offered to purchase it for $75,000, on condition
that title would close on or before December 1. On September 18, the
defendant accepted the buyer's offer. On September 19, the buyer gave
the defendant $10,000 as a deposit.

On November 15, the buyer notified the defendant that he had changed
his mind and would not go through with the purchase of the house,
agreeing to forfeit the deposit that he had paid in return for the
defendant's agreement not to sue for damages. The following day, the
defendant entered into a contract to sell the house to another buyer for
$80,000. The defendant subsequently rejected the plaintiff's demand
for payment.

If the plaintiff institutes a claim against the defendant for her
commission, she is entitled to collect

294

(A) $4,800 (6 percent of $80,000).

(B) $4,500 (6 percent of $75,000).

(C) $600 (6 percent of $10,000).

(D) nothing.

85. A trash collector contracted with the city to collect garbage. Although
the contract entitled the collector to $150,000 for five years, the
collector requested an additional $10,000 a year from the city council
because his operating costs had substantially increased due to an
unanticipated explosion of new houses. The city made the payments. A
citizen then sued to have the additional payments refunded to the city.
The court should rule in favor of

(A) the collector, because the city council agreed to the additional

$10,000 a year.

(B) the collector, because there was a valid modification of the

contract.

(C) the citizen, because the collector had a pre-existing duty to collect

the city's garbage.

(D) the citizen, because the collector took unfair advantage of the city

by requesting more money to pick up the trash.

86. The defendant and his wife were co-owners of a parcel of realty. After
25 years of marriage, they decided to execute wills. Before executing
the wills, they agreed in writing that each would leave a life estate in
his or her share of the realty to the other, and that the survivor would
leave a fee interest in the realty to their son, the plaintiff. After
executing their wills, they told the plaintiff about their agreement. The
plaintiff had recently contracted for the purchase of a residence but
subsequently canceled the contract. Shortly afterwards, the defendant's
wife died, leaving a life estate in her share of the realty to the
defendant. One year later, the defendant remarried and changed his will
to leave the realty to his second wife. When the defendant died, the
plaintiff learned that the defendant's will left the realty to his second
wife, so he sued the executrix of the defendant's estate for damages
resulting from the defendant's breach of his agreement with his first
wife.

The court should find for

295

(A) the plaintiff, because he canceled his contract for the purchase of a
residence in reliance on the agreement between the defendant and
his first wife.

(B) the plaintiff, because after his mother's death, the plaintiff became a
creditor beneficiary of the agreement between the defendant and his
first wife.

(C) the defendant's executrix, because the plaintiff is a donee

beneficiary of the agreement between the defendant and his first
wife.

(D) the defendant's executrix, because by its terms, the agreement

between the defendant and his first wife might be capable of being
performed within one year.

87. The plaintiff, an unmarried woman, became pregnant. Before the child
was born, she told the defendant that he was the father. The defendant
agreed to pay the expenses of having the child in return for the
plaintiff's promise not to bring a paternity suit. After the child was
born, the defendant refused to pay. A blood test then proved that the
child could not be the defendant's. The plaintiff sued the defendant,
claiming the defendant still needed to live up to the settlement since
she had truly believed he was the father of the child. The court should
rule in favor of

(A) the plaintiff, because she detrimentally relied on the defendant's

promise.

(B) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff had a reasonable subjective

belief that her claim was valid.

(C) the defendant, because forbearance to bring suit cannot count as

consideration for a settlement.

(D) the defendant, because the plaintiff merely surrendered an invalid

claim.

88. When they decided to computerize their paperwork, a law firm

contacted a specialist in the application of computer technology to the
practice of law. After negotiations, the firm entered into a written
contract with the specialist on June 1. According to the terms of the
contract, the specialist was to immediately deliver and install in the
office of the firm a computer and other specified hardware. The
specialist was also required to design and install, by October 15,

296

software consisting of a computer program that would suit the special
needs of the firm's practice. In addition, the specialist agreed to
service and maintain the hardware for a period of six years from the
date of the contract. In return, the firm agreed to pay $5,000 within 30
days after delivery of the hardware, $5,000 within 30 days after
delivery of the software, and $1,000 on the first day of each year that
the contract remained in effect.

The firm also agreed to furnish specifications for the software at least
30 days before the date for its installation. The hardware referred to in
the contract was standard equipment, readily available from and
serviceable by any reputable computer supplier. The software was not
standard, however, and its design required special skill and
knowledge regarding the application of computer technology to the
practice of law. The contract specified that the price of the hardware
was $6,000, the price of the software was $4,000, and the charge for
service and maintenance was $1,000 per year. On June 15, the
specialist installed the agreed hardware in the office of the firm. On
June 20, in satisfaction of an antecedent debt, the specialist assigned to
another computer programmer her rights to receive payment for
hardware already delivered under the contract with the firm. On
August 1, before beginning to work on the design for the agreed
software, the specialist sold her business to an established and
reputable computer dealer. By the terms of the sale, the specialist
assigned to the computer dealer all her rights under the contract with
the firm.

The firm failed to make any payment following the installation of the
hardware, and on August 15, the specialist instituted a claim against
them for $5,000. Which of the following would be the firm's most
effective argument in defense against that claim?

(A) The specialist has not begun work on designing the software

required by the contract.

(B) The specialist has made at least one effective assignment of her

rights under the contract.

(C) The firm has no assurance that the specialist's obligations under the

contract will be fulfilled.

(D) The contract between the specialist and the firm was divisible.

297

89. A drug manufacturer made vaccines and sold them to various

distributors. Just before the drug manufacturer was about to raise the
price of its vaccines, one of the distributors learned of the pending
price increase. On May 19, the distributor placed a large order for
1,000 vials. The distributor's order stated that the distributor was to
receive a price of $64 per vial (the old price), compared with the new
price of $171. On June 3, the manufacturer shipped 50 vials at the old
price, and simultaneously notified the distributor that the remainder of
this order would be priced at the new price. The notice said the
manufacturer was shipping the 50 vials as a favor, and acceptance of
the order was expressly conditioned on the manufacturer's terms. The
notice also said that if the distributor wanted to cancel the balance of
the order, it could do so on or before June 13. The distributor sued for
an order of specific performance compelling the manufacturer to sell it
the remaining 950 vials at the old price. The court should rule in favor
of

(A) the distributor, because the manufacturer accepted the offer by

shipping 50 vials.

(B) the distributor, because the manufacturer breached the contract by

sending only 50 vials.

(C) the manufacturer, because the distributor's actions were

unreasonable.

(D) the manufacturer, because it made a counteroffer.

90. The defendant was a veterinarian who specialized in the treatment of

livestock, including pigs, horses, cows, and sheep. The plaintiff was a
farmer who raised various species of livestock. In addition, the
plaintiff kept a private collection of exotic animals. Because the
plaintiff's livestock frequently needed the attention of a veterinarian, he
entered into a written contract with the defendant on January 1. Under
the terms of the contract, the plaintiff was to pay the defendant $250
per month for one year, in return for which the defendant would render
whatever treatment the plaintiff's livestock required during that period.

On February 10, the local zoo telephoned the defendant, offering to
give her a surplus tiger. Although the defendant had no experience with
exotic animals, she accepted the tiger and put it in a cage in the back of
her office. On February 22, having heard that the defendant had
acquired a tiger, the plaintiff called her. When he asked the defendant

298

if she was interested in selling the tiger for $450, she said, “I was
hoping to get $1,000 for the tiger, but I'll throw it in under our existing
contract without charging you anything at all for it.” On March 10, the
defendant was at the plaintiff's farm for the purpose of inoculating
some of his cattle. When the plaintiff asked why she had not brought
the tiger, the defendant said, “I've changed my mind. If you want the
tiger, you'll have to pay $450 for it.”

The plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant because of her
refusal to deliver the tiger as promised. The court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because although the defendant was not a merchant as

to the sale of a tiger, she was a merchant as to the sale of veterinary
services.

(B) the plaintiff, because his conversation with the defendant on
February 22 resulted in a valid modification of the existing
contract.

(C) the defendant, because her promise to give the plaintiff the tiger

was unsupported by consideration.

(D) the defendant, because her promise to give the plaintiff the tiger

was not in writing.

91. On January 3, a lumber retailer ordered from a lumber wholesaler

1,000 2” × 4” fir boards, each 8 feet in length, for delivery by January
15. When the wholesaler delivered the fir boards on January 15, they
were received by the retailer's manager, who informed the retailer that
delivery was made but that the boards delivered by the wholesaler
were only 7 feet long. The retailer intended to notify the wholesaler
immediately, but he was busy and forgot to do so.

On February 20, the retailer received the wholesaler's bill for the
boards, but he did not pay the bill or communicate with the wholesaler
in any way. On May 15, the wholesaler instituted a claim against the
retailer for the price of the boards, and, in defense, the retailer
contended that the boards delivered did not conform to the contract of
sale. The court should find for

(A) the wholesaler, because the retailer failed to inform him that the

boards were only 7 feet in length.

(B) the wholesaler, because a merchant buyer who accepts delivery of

299

nonconforming goods is bound to pay for them at the contract price.

(C) the retailer, because the boards did not conform to the contract of

sale.

(D) the retailer, because a merchant seller is not entitled to the price of
nonconforming goods if a reasonable inspection prior to shipment
would have disclosed the nonconformity.

92. A manufacturer of tractors had purchased hundreds of motors from an
engine maker in the past at a price of $5,000 each. In 2011, the engine
maker ceased production of the motor. By April 15, 2012, the engine
maker found that she had only three motors left in her warehouse.
Because she wanted to make room for the newer models, the engine
maker signed and sent the following letter to the tractor manufacturer
on April 15, 2012:

I have only three motors left in stock and have stopped manufacturing
them. If you are interested, I will sell you any or all of them for $1,000
each, a fraction of their usual price. Because we have done business in
the past, I promise to hold this offer open until June 1, 2012.

Because the engine maker told the tractor manufacturer that she would
hold the offer open until June 1, the tractor manufacturer went away on
vacation without responding. On May 15, 2012, not having heard from
the tractor manufacturer, the engine maker sold two of the motors to a
car dealer for $1,000 each. Afraid to lose out on any more motors, the
tractor manufacturer then bought the remaining motor when he
returned.

Was the engine maker's statement, “I promise to hold this offer open
until June 1,” supported by consideration?

(A) Yes, because it was a firm offer under the UCC.

(B) Yes, because the tractor manufacturer detrimentally relied upon it

by not responding before May 15.

(C) Yes, because the tractor manufacturer subsequently purchased one

of the motors from the engine maker.

(D) No, because the tractor manufacturer gave nothing in return for the

promise.

93. The defendant and her assistant were working alone late one night

300

when the defendant had a heart attack that rendered her unconscious
and caused her to fall down an airshaft. The assistant believed the
defendant to be dead, but he called for an ambulance and leaped into
the airshaft, sustaining serious injury himself. Finding that the
defendant was still alive, the assistant gave her first aid consisting of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. When the ambulance arrived,
paramedics used stretchers and pulleys to get the defendant and the
assistant out of the airshaft, and then they brought them to the hospital.
Several days later, while she was still in the hospital, a doctor told the
defendant that she would probably have died if not for the assistant's
quick and effective action. The defendant wrote the assistant a note that
said, “In return for your saving my life, I'm going to pay all your
hospital bills. In addition, I'm going to add a bonus of $3,000 per
month to your salary for the rest of your life. If you choose to retire
right now, I'll pay you $3,000 per month for the rest of your life as a
retirement pension.” The defendant paid the assistant's hospital bills,
but because her business took an unexpected downturn, she never paid
him $3,000, and subsequently she informed him that she would not be
able to pay him a bonus or a retirement pension. If the assistant asserts
a claim against the defendant for her failure to pay him the bonus of
$3,000 per month, which of the following would be the assistant's most
effective argument in support of his claim?

(A) The defendant's promise to pay the bonus was in writing.

(B) The assistant detrimentally relied on the defendant's promise.

(C) The defendant's promise was supported by an underlying moral

obligation.

(D) The assistant's rescue of the defendant resulted in a contract

implied-in-fact.

94. An art dealer employed several agents who traveled throughout the
world purchasing art for her to sell in her gallery. One of her agents
sent her a painting that she said was by a famous artist. The dealer had
just received the painting and was about to place it on display when the
buyer, a collector of art, came into the gallery. Seeing the new painting,
he said, “An interesting painting by the famous artist.” The dealer
replied, “Yes, it is. I'm asking $50,000 for it.” The buyer agreed to the
price and immediately wrote a check for the sum of $50,000 payable to
the order of the dealer, writing the words “Payment in full for the
painting by the famous artist” on the back of the check. The dealer

301

accepted the check and delivered the painting to the buyer. If the
painting had actually been by the famous artist, it would have been
worth $50,000. The same day, however, the buyer discovered that the
painting was a forgery, worth only a few hundred dollars, and he
stopped payment on his check before the dealer could cash it.

If the dealer asserts a claim against the buyer for breach of contract,
which of the following would be the buyer's most effective defense?

(A) The contract of sale was not evidenced by a writing signed by both

parties.

(B) At the time of sale, the buyer and the dealer both believed that the

painting was by the famous artist.

(C) It is unconscionable to make the buyer pay $50,000 for a painting

worth only a few hundred dollars.

(D) The painting was not adequate consideration for the buyer's

promise to pay.

95. On February 1, the landlord and the tenant entered into a written

contract. By its terms, the landlord was to rent the tenant a building for
use by the tenant as a “sports book,” which is an establishment where
bets are made on horse races and other sporting events. The tenant's
tenancy was to commence on April 1 and to continue for a period of
two years. Rent was to be $1,000 per month, plus 20 percent of the
tenant's gross profits. Prior to occupancy by the tenant, the landlord
was to remodel the building's interior so that it would be suitable for
the tenant's purpose. Specifically, the contract required the landlord to
install a “tote-board” that could instantaneously compute and display
gambling odds on specified sporting events, a series of projection-
screen televisions with cable connections for the broadcast of sporting
events as they happened, and other equipment suitable only for use in a
“sports book” establishment. Upon signing the contract on February 1,
the tenant gave the landlord a deposit of $2,000. At that time, neither
party could have reasonably anticipated that existing state law would
be changed. On April 1, the landlord had not made the agreed
improvements in the interior of the building and refused to comply with
the tenant's demand for the return of his deposit.

On February 1, existing state law prohibited the operation of a “sports
book,” but on April 1, existing state law permitted the operation of a

302

“sports book.” If the tenant sues the landlord for the return of his
deposit, the court should find for

(A) the landlord, because public policy prohibits the enforcement of

gambling contracts.

(B) the landlord, because the agreement of February 1 had an illegal

purpose.

(C) the tenant, because he and the landlord were in pari delicto.

(D) the tenant, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

96. In January, a farmer planted a field of beans that would be ready for
harvest in June. Because she expected the harvest to yield more than
5,000 bushels of beans, she entered into a written contract with a buyer
on March 1, wherein the farmer agreed to sell and the buyer agreed to
buy 2,000 bushels of beans at $2 a bushel to be delivered during the
month of June. On March 2, the farmer entered into an identical written
contract with a restaurant.

In the first week of April, heavy rains inundated the farmer's field,
destroying part of her crop. As a result, she doubted that she would be
able to fulfill her contract with both the buyer and the restaurant. On
April 15, she called the restaurant and said that because of the storms,
she would not be able to deliver more than 1,000 bushels. The
restaurant said “I'll take whatever you deliver, but I intend to hold you
to the terms of our contract.”

On June 15, the farmer harvested her field. The American Bean
Exchange price on June 15 was $2 per bushel, and beans were readily
available at that price. The farmer's harvest yielded 2,000 bushels of
beans, and on June 15 she delivered 1,000 bushels to the restaurant. If
the restaurant institutes a claim against her for damages resulting from
breach of contract, which of the following would be the farmer's most
effective argument in defense?

(A) Her inability to deliver 2,000 bushels was the result of an Act of

God.

(B) She notified the restaurant on April 15 that she would be unable to

deliver more than 1,000 bushels.

(C) The restaurant sustained no substantial damage, since the contract

price equaled the market price on the day of delivery.

303

(D) Her obligation to the buyer was greater than her obligation to the

restaurant, since her contract with the buyer was formed before her
contract with the restaurant.

97. The homeowner went into his garage one morning and found that
someone had broken in during the night and stolen a hand-carved
milking stool that had been stored there. The stool did not have much
intrinsic worth, but it was a family heirloom and had great sentimental
value for the homeowner. The angry homeowner ran into a bar that was
located near his home. Entering the bar, he said in a loud voice, “I'll
pay $1,000 to anyone who finds the thief that stole a hand-carved stool
out of my garage last night.” The owner of the bar heard the
homeowner's statement and said, “I'll catch that thief for you.”

Which of the following statements most correctly describes the
position of the homeowner and the owner of the bar following 
the incident in the bar?

(A) The homeowner has made an offer for a unilateral contract that

became irrevocable when the owner of the bar said, “I'll catch that
thief for you.”

(B) The homeowner has made an offer for a unilateral contract that the
owner of the bar can accept only by catching the thief before the
homeowner makes an effective revocation of the offer.

(C) The homeowner and the owner of the bar are parties to a bilateral

contract.

(D) The homeowner has not made any offer that can be accepted by the

owner of the bar.

98. The landowner was the owner of two adjoining parcels of unimproved
realty. Although she was interested in improving and selling the realty,
she did not have the necessary capital. After negotiation, the landowner
entered into a written contract with a building contractor. According to
the terms of the contract, the builder was to provide labor and
materials for the construction of a building on one of the parcels
according to certain specifications. All construction was to be
completed by a certain date, at which time the landowner was to
convey the other parcel of realty to the builder as his sole
compensation for the labor and materials supplied. The contract
contained a clause providing for liquidated damages in the event of a
breach by either party.

304

After the builder completed construction as agreed, the landowner
refused to convey the other parcel of realty to him. As a result, the
builder appropriately asserted alternative claims for relief against the
landowner, demanding liquidated damages as provided in the contract,
actual damages, or an order directing the landowner to perform as
agreed.

Which of the following correctly describes the builder's rights against
the landowner?

(A) If the liquidated damages clause established a penalty, the court can
properly enter judgment for any actual damages that resulted from
the landowner's breach.

(B) If the liquidated damages clause did not establish a penalty, the
court can properly direct the landowner to perform as agreed.

(C) If the liquidated damages clause established a penalty, the court can
enter a judgment for any actual damages; if it did not, the court can
direct the landowner to perform as agreed.

(D) The builder has no enforceable rights.

99. An automobile dealer sold an expensive line of imported automobiles.
The company that manufactured the vehicles in Germany sold them to
the dealer at the wholesale price for resale by the dealer at the retail
price.

On January 12, a buyer ordered a new automobile from the dealer,
executing a written contract of purchase and sale at the specified retail
price. The car was to be equipped with certain optional equipment and
was to be delivered on or before March 15. Immediately after
contracting with the buyer, the dealer ordered the car from the
company in Germany.

On February 28, another buyer ordered from the dealer a car identical
to that which had been ordered by the first buyer at an identical price.
The following day, before ordering a car for the second buyer from the
company, the dealer received the car ordered by the first buyer. When
the first buyer was notified, however, he said that he had changed his
mind and would not go through with the transaction. The dealer
therefore delivered the car to the second buyer and did not order a car

305

for the second buyer from the manufacturer.

If the dealer asserts a claim against the first buyer for damages
resulting from breach of contract, the dealer is entitled to recover

(A) nothing, because the car was sold to the second buyer at the same

price that the first buyer agreed to pay.

(B) the difference between the wholesale price of the car and its retail

price.

(C) the difference, if any, between the price that the first buyer agreed

to pay for the car and its reasonable market value.

(D) the difference, if any, between the price that the dealer paid for the

car and its reasonable market value.

100. For several years following his graduation from college, the plaintiff
made no attempt to find employment. During this period, he was
usually intoxicated, and spent most of his time drinking alcohol at the
bar owner's tavern. On September 1, 2012, the plaintiff's mother stated
orally that if the plaintiff promised to go to law school and to stop
drinking for the rest of his life, she would give him $10,000 on July 1,
2013. The plaintiff promised that he would never drink alcohol again
and that he would enroll in law school as soon as possible.

The plaintiff began attending a law school two weeks later. In
December 2012, however, he withdrew from the school, deciding that
he did not like it.

On July 1, 2013, the plaintiff's mother refused to pay, and the plaintiff
asserted a claim against her for $10,000. Which of the following
would be the plaintiff's mother's most effective argument in response
to that claim?

(A) The plaintiff's completion of law school was an implied condition

precedent to his mother's promise to pay $10,000.

(B) The plaintiff's remaining in law school until July 1, 2013, was an

implied condition precedent to his mother's duty to pay.

(C) The plaintiff's mother's promise was not supported by

consideration.

(D) The plaintiff's mother's promise was not in writing.

306

101. The defendant's father earned his living as a crop-duster, using an

airplane to dust farmers' fields with insecticides for a fee. When he
died, he left the business to the defendant. Although the defendant did
not know how to fly an airplane and did not personally participate in
crop-dusting, she continued to run the business by hiring pilots to fly
the crop-dusting planes. Soon after inheriting the business, the
defendant entered into a business contract with the plaintiff, a farmer.
The terms of the contract required the defendant's company to dust the
plaintiff's crop four times per year for a period of four years, at a total
price of $10,000 that the plaintiff paid upon signing the contract.

The defendant's company performed as agreed for two years. At the
end of that period, the defendant sold the entire business to a local
pilot, assigning to the pilot the balance of her contract with the
plaintiff. All the defendant's employees agreed to work for the pilot.

After being notified of the assignment, the plaintiff sued the defendant,
asserting that the defendant's sale of the business to the pilot was a
breach of the defendant's obligation under the contract because crop-
dusting involves a personal service. Which of the following would be
the defendant's most effective argument in response to that claim?

(A) An assignment of contract rights includes a delegation of contract

duties.

(B) The pilot had more expertise at crop-dusting than the defendant did.

(C) The defendant had never personally participated in dusting the

plaintiff's fields.

(D) The defendant's assignment of the plaintiff's contract to the pilot did
not impose an additional burden on the plaintiff since there was no
change in price.

102. The shareholder was a major shareholder of the corporation, a retail
company. In January, the corporation had cash-flow problems that
placed it in danger of insolvency. On January 15, the corporation
applied to the bank for a loan, but the bank said that it would lend the
money requested only if the shareholder agreed to guarantee payment
by the corporation. Fearful of losing her investment in the corporation,
the shareholder promised the bank on January 16 that if the corporation
did not repay the loan as agreed, the shareholder would do so. On
January 17, the bank made the requested loan to the corporation.

307

On May 1, the corporation defaulted in payment, and the bank
threatened to force the corporation into bankruptcy. On May 11, in an
attempt to save the company, the corporation officials offered to turn
some of the corporate assets over to the bank for sale at their market
value, with the understanding that if the market value exceeded the
amount that the corporation owed the bank, the bank would refund the
excess to the corporation.

The bank rejected the corporation's offer of May 11 and asserted a
claim against the shareholder for repayment of the loan. Which of the
following additional facts or inferences, if it were the only one true,
would be most likely to lead a court to find in favor of the
shareholder?

(A) The shareholder's January 16 promise to pay the corporation's debt

was induced by the fear that the corporation could not continue to
exist without the loan.

(B) The shareholder's January 16 promise to pay the corporation's debt

was not in writing.

(C) The shareholder received nothing of value in return for her January

16 promise to pay the corporation's debt.

(D) The assets that the corporation offered to turn over to the bank on

May 11 were sufficient to repay the loan.

103. The landlord was the owner of a storefront building that she leased to
the tenant for a three-year period. The tenant paid the rent for two
years, and then he assigned the balance of his lease to a woman,
advising the landlord in writing that the woman would be paying the
rent from that point on. For the following five months, the woman paid
the rent directly to the landlord. Then the woman moved out and
stopped paying rent. If the landlord asserts a claim against the tenant
for unpaid rent, which of the following arguments would be most
effective in the tenant's defense?

(A) The landlord's accepting rent from the woman resulted in a

novation.

(B) The landlord's accepting rent from the woman resulted in an accord

and satisfaction.

(C) By accepting rent from the woman, the landlord impliedly

consented to the tenant's assignment to the woman.

308

(D) A prohibition against assignment of a leasehold interest is a

restraint against alienation.

104. The defendant owned a trucking company. His wife, the plaintiff, was
a freelance book illustrator. When a book publisher contacted the
defendant to discuss the transportation of his products, the defendant
promised the plaintiff that he would get the publisher to employ her as
a book illustrator for a year. During negotiations with the publisher, the
defendant offered the publisher a lower rate if the publisher would do
so.

The defendant and the publisher subsequently entered into a written
one-year contract for the defendant to transport all the publisher's
products at a specific low rate. At the same time, the publisher orally
agreed that in return for the low rate that the defendant was giving him,
he would employ the plaintiff for a year as his book illustrator, starting
immediately.

When the plaintiff learned of the agreement, she notified all her clients
that she could no longer work for them because illustrating books for
the publisher would take all her time. For the next six months, the
plaintiff did a satisfactory job as the publisher's book illustrator. Then,
she and the defendant were divorced. Following the divorce, the
defendant told the publisher that he was releasing him from his
promise to employ the plaintiff and would give him the same low rate
even if the publisher did not continue to employ the plaintiff for the
rest of the year. The publisher thereupon discharged the plaintiff from
his employ.

The plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for damages that
resulted from his releasing the publisher from the promise to employ
the plaintiff for a year. If the defendant's only defense is that he
received no consideration for promising the plaintiff that the publisher
would employ her for a year, which of the following would be the
plaintiff's most effective argument in response to that defense?

(A) The publisher's promise to employ the plaintiff for one year was
obtained by the defendant as a gift from the defendant to the
plaintiff.

(B) The defendant made an irrevocable assignment to the plaintiff of

rights under his contract with the publisher.

309

(C) No consideration is required to support a promise between husband

and wife.

(D) The publisher's promise to hire the plaintiff for one year was given

in return for the low rate that the defendant gave him.

105. When the seller inherited a valuable painting, he asked the buyer, an
art dealer, if she was interested in buying it. On January 15, after
looking at the painting, the buyer said that she would not have enough
cash to purchase the painting until February 1. At the buyer's request,
the seller signed a document containing a written offer to sell the
painting to the buyer for $50,000 and a written promise to hold the
offer open until February 2.

On January 20, the seller sold the painting to someone else for
$45,000. The following day, after the buyer read about the sale in a
newspaper, she went to the seller's home with $50,000 in cash and
demanded that the seller sell her the painting for that price. The seller
refused, saying that he was withdrawing his offer.

If the buyer asserts a claim for damages resulting from the seller's sale
of the painting to another, the court should find for

(A) the buyer, because she accepted the seller's offer before the seller

withdrew it.

(B) the buyer, because the seller promised in writing to hold the offer

open until February 2.

(C) the seller, because a judgment for damages is not an appropriate

remedy for breach of a contract to sell a unique chattel.

(D) the seller, because when the buyer tendered payment, she knew that

the seller had already sold the painting.

106. The buyer operated a grocery store in which he sold fresh fish and

other food items. The seller was a wholesaler of fresh fish. By a
written contract, the buyer and the seller agreed that the buyer would
purchase from the seller 100 kilograms per week of a fish known as
“rock lurgid” at a specified price that was higher than the market price
of “scmods,” another type of fish. When the seller made the first
delivery under the contract, however, the buyer refused to accept it,
complaining that the fish delivered by the seller was scmods, a species
unrelated to lurgid. The buyer was aware of the fact that scmods is

310

frequently referred to as “rock lurgid.”

The seller subsequently asserted a breach of contract claim against the
buyer. At the trial, the seller attempted to testify that in the fresh fish
industry, scmods is frequently referred to as “rock lurgid.”

If the buyer objects, this testimony should be

(A) excluded, because it modifies the terms of a written contract that
the buyer and the seller intended to be a complete record of their
agreement.

(B) excluded, because the price to which the buyer and the seller

agreed is higher than the market price of scmods.

(C) admitted, because the buyer was aware of the fact that scmods is

frequently referred to as “rock lurgid.”

(D) admitted, to explain the meaning of the term “rock lurgid” as used

in the contract.

107. After serving in the military for 10 years, the plaintiff informed her
father that she had gotten married and was retiring from military
service. Glad to hear the news, the plaintiff's father said, “Because
that's what I always hoped you would do, I'm going to give you a home
as a wedding present.” He showed the plaintiff plans for the
construction of a house and promised that he would have it built on a
lot that he owned and would deed it to her as soon as it was complete.
The plaintiff was so pleased with the plans that her father showed her
that she immediately canceled a contract that she had already made for
the purchase of a home.

The following week, the plaintiff's father contacted the defendant, a
builder. The plaintiff's father showed the defendant the plans and
asked her to build a house according to those plans so that he could
give it to his daughter as a wedding present. By a written contract, the
plaintiff's father and the defendant agreed that the defendant would
build on the father's lot according to the plans on a cost-plus-profit
basis. The plaintiff's father immediately sent a copy of the contract and
plans to the plaintiff.

The defendant subsequently informed the plaintiff's father that soil
conditions would make it necessary to drive piles for the foundation,

311

increasing costs by approximately 600 percent. At the defendant's
suggestion, the plaintiff's father and the defendant agreed to the
construction of a less expensive house instead, to be based on different
plans. When the plaintiff learned about the change, she informed her
father and the defendant that she was dissatisfied with their new
agreement.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant as a third-party
beneficiary of the original contract between the plaintiff's father and
the defendant, the defendant's most effective argument in defense
would be that

(A) the plaintiff was a donee beneficiary because the house was being

built as a wedding present for her.

(B) the plaintiff was a creditor beneficiary because the contract

between her father and the defendant was made after her father
promised the plaintiff that he would give her the house.

(C) the plaintiff did not rely to her detriment on her father's promise to

give her a house built according to any particular plans.

(D) the plaintiff was not an intended third-party beneficiary of the

contract between her father and the defendant.

108. On January 5, because he needed money to pay the rent on his store,

the storeowner sent copies of the following letter to four possible
buyers:

I need to sell my heart-shaped diamond ring by January 15 for $1,500.
I am making this offer to four possible buyers because all of you have
admired the ring. If interested, please contact me before January 15.

On January 14, the storeowner received a letter from the first buyer
agreeing to pay $1,500 for the ring. The storeowner did not respond to
letter. On January 17, the storeowner received a letter from the second
buyer agreeing to pay $1,700 for the ring. On January 17, the
storeowner wrote to the second buyer saying, “I agree to the terms of
your letter.”

The first buyer asserts a claim against the storeowner on account of the
storeowner's refusal to sell the ring to the first buyer for $1,500. The
court should find for

312

(A) the storeowner, because the offer contained in the storeowner's

letter of January 5 was revoked by his letter to the second buyer on
January 17.

(B) the storeowner, because he did not accept the offer contained in the

first buyer's letter.

(C) the first buyer, because the first buyer complied with the terms of

the storeowner's offer.

(D) the first buyer, because the second buyer's letter was not received

by the storeowner until after January 15.

109. The defendant was a retailer of home-gardening supplies. On March 1,
the defendant entered into a written contract with a wholesaler of
seeds. According to the terms, the wholesaler was to furnish the
defendant with seeds in 10-pound bags at a specified price. The
contract provided that for a period of one year, the defendant would
purchase all its seeds from the wholesaler and that the wholesaler
would furnish all the seeds required by the defendant. It provided
further that the defendant would advise the wholesaler of its
requirements by the first of each month, and that the wholesaler would
make delivery by the end of that month. The contract was silent about
the right to assign or delegate.

Upon signing the contract on March 1, the defendant notified the
wholesaler of its seed requirements for that month. The wholesaler
made a delivery to the defendant on March 17. Prior to April 1, the
defendant notified the wholesaler of its requirements for April. On
April 20, the wholesaler sold its entire business to the plaintiff,
including its contract with the defendant, and notified the defendant of
the sale the same day. On April 24, after the defendant received notice
of the assignment, the plaintiff delivered the seed that the defendant
ordered from the wholesaler.

The next day, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, enclosing a check for
the seeds the plaintiff had delivered and demanding that the plaintiff
assure the defendant that it would be able to meet the defendant's seed
requirements in the future. On June 1, not having heard from the
plaintiff, the defendant notified the wholesaler and the plaintiff that it
was canceling the contract.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for breach of

313

contract, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the defendant failed to order seeds as

required by contract.

(B) the plaintiff, because there was no indication that the terms of the

contract would not be performed by the plaintiff.

(C) the defendant, because the plaintiff failed to furnish assurances as

demanded by the defendant.

(D) the defendant, because requirements contracts are not assignable

without consent of the purchaser.

110. The homeowner hired a painting contractor to paint the homeowner's

residence, entering into a valid written contract with the contractor that
fixed the price of the job at $5,000 and provided that the contractor
would deliver a “satisfactory result.” Because the contractor wished to
give his daughter the money that he received from the job as a wedding
gift, a clause of the contract directed the homeowner to pay the money
directly to the daughter. After the contractor finished painting the
house, he sent the homeowner a bill for $5,000. When the homeowner
received the bill, he called the contractor and complained about the
paint job, saying that he did not think it was “satisfactory” as required
by the contract. He said, “I've got half a mind not to pay you at all, but
if you'll take $4,500, I'm willing to call it square.” The contractor
reluctantly agreed to accept $4,500 payable directly to him because he
needed cash. The homeowner paid the $4,500 to the contractor, who
did not give any part of it to the daughter.

The daughter learned about the contract between the contractor and the
homeowner after the contractor received payment from the
homeowner. Which of the following most accurately describes the
rights of the daughter?

(A) The daughter is entitled to collect $5,000 from the homeowner.

(B) The daughter is entitled to collect $4,500 from the contractor.

(C) The daughter is entitled to collect $5,000 from the homeowner or

$4,500 from the contractor, but not both.

(D) The daughter is not entitled to collect anything from either party.

111. When the landowner's daughter told him that she was getting married,
the landowner was so happy that he promised to deed her a parcel of

314

realty that he owned and to have a house built on it for her as a
wedding present. The following day, the landowner entered into a
written contract with the defendant, a building contractor, for the
construction of a house on the landowner's land. The landowner later
gave his daughter a copy of the contract, and, as a result, she canceled
a contract into which she had previously entered for the purchase of a
home. As a result of an argument between the landowner and the
defendant, the defendant never built the house.

The landowner later deeds the land to his daughter, and she asserts a
claim against the defendant for failure to fulfill the obligations under
his contract with the landowner. The court should find for

(A) the daughter, because the landowner intended for her to benefit

from his contract with the defendant.

(B) the defendant, because the contract called for personal services.

(C) the defendant, because the daughter is an incidental beneficiary.

(D) the defendant, because the daughter is a donee beneficiary.

112. The defendant was an investor who frequently bought and sold real
estate on his own account. He had purchased a parcel of realty for
$100,000 and was considering selling it. On September 1, the plaintiff,
another real estate investor, asked whether the defendant would be
willing to accept $125,000 for the property. The defendant said that he
would, but only if payment was in cash. When the plaintiff said that he
would need a month or two to raise that kind of money, the defendant
wrote the following on a sheet of paper and signed it:

I  hereby  offer  to  sell  my  realty  to  the  plaintiff  for  $125,000  cash.  I
promise  to  hold  this  offer  open  until  November  1,  and  I  further
promise  that  I  will  not  sell  the  property  to  anyone  else  before  then.
This is a firm offer.

On October 20, the defendant sold the property to another person for
$110,000 and wrote the plaintiff a note in which he said, “I hereby
withdraw my offer to sell you the property for $125,000.” On October
25, the plaintiff purchased the property from the other person for
$135,000.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for damages
resulting from the defendant's sale of the property to the other person,

315

the court should find for

(A) the defendant, because he received no consideration for his

promise to keep the offer open.

(B) the defendant, because he sold the realty to the other person more

than 30 days after promising the plaintiff to keep the offer open.

(C) the plaintiff, because the document that the defendant signed on

September 1 was a firm offer in writing.

(D) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff customarily engaged in buying

and selling real estate.

113. When he won the state lottery, the defendant bought a new home and
decided to have it landscaped by a well-known landscape architect.
After investigating several sources, the defendant learned that the
landscaper was one of the most famous landscape architects in the
world. Following a series of discussions, the defendant and the
landscaper entered into a written contract that called for the
landscaper to design and execute a landscaping plan for the defendant's
property at a total price of $90,000. Upon completion of the job, the
defendant was to pay $80,000 of this sum directly to the landscaper.
The defendant agreed to pay the balance of $10,000 to the plaintiff
because the landscaper was indebted to the plaintiff for that sum. A
clause of the contract provided that “there shall be no assignment of
rights under this contract.”

The landscaper's design called for a moat to be dug around the
defendant's house and planted with aquatic plants. Although the
landscaper completed the rest of the job himself, he hired an
earthmoving subcontractor to dig the moat, which the earthmoving
subcontractor did in complete conformity with the landscaper's plan.
When the job was completed, the plaintiff executed a document
purporting to assign his rights under the contract to another person.
The entire job was completed in a reasonably workmanlike manner,
but the defendant refused to make any payment under the contract.

The plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for $10,000, which
the plaintiff claims the defendant owes him under the contract. Which
of the following would be the defendant's most effective argument in
defense against that claim?

(A) The plaintiff has made a valid assignment of his rights under the

316

contract.

(B) The plaintiff was not a party to the contract.

(C) The plaintiff was a mere incidental beneficiary of the contract.

(D) There was no mutuality of obligation between the defendant and the

plaintiff.

114. A manufacturer needed a new factory and purchased a parcel of realty
on which he wished to have it constructed. After negotiation, the
manufacturer entered into a valid written contract with a licensed
builder. Pursuant to its terms, the builder was to construct a two-story
building on the manufacturer's realty according to specifications
furnished by the manufacturer, at a total price of $250,000 to be paid in
full upon completion of the building. The builder completed the
building, and the manufacturer paid him $250,000, but subsequently the
manufacturer learned that the building failed to conform to the
specifications. As a result, it would not serve the manufacturer's
purpose. The building had the same value as if constructed in
conformity with the specifications, but it would cost the manufacturer
$12,000 to make it conform to the specifications. Because of an
increase in the costs of construction, it would cost $350,000 to
construct a new building in conformity with the specifications.

If the manufacturer asserts a claim against the builder for breach of
contract, the manufacturer should recover

(A) nothing, because the building had the same value as if built in

conformity with the specifications.

(B) $12,000 (the cost of making the building conform to the

specifications).

(C) $100,000 (the difference between the contract price and the cost of

having a new building constructed in accordance with the
specifications).

(D) $250,000 (the contract price).

115. The seller wanted to sell his piano. Because four buyers had all

expressed interest in it, the seller wrote and signed the following letter
on May 1, sending a photocopy to each of the persons named:

Dear Four Potential Buyers:

317

I know that you are all interested in buying my piano and I need to sell
it. I therefore promise to sell it to whichever of you makes the highest
offer prior to June 15.

(signed)

The seller's letter of May 1 to the four buyers is best described as

(A) a firm offer.

(B) an invitation for offers.

(C) an option to purchase that was given to Able, Baker, Carr, and
Davis but could only be exercised by the first to respond.

(D) an auction.

116. On January 17, a homeowner hired a builder to build a new

greenhouse on his property. After negotiation, they entered into a valid
written contract that fixed the price at $8,000. Work was to be
completed by March 1. On February 1, when the greenhouse was one-
quarter complete, it was totally destroyed in a freak snowstorm. The
damage made it impossible to complete construction by March 1.
Because he was scheduled to begin construction on a new hotel on
March 2, the builder informed the homeowner that he would perform
no further work on the greenhouse. The homeowner subsequently hired
a second builder, who agreed to build the greenhouse for $9,000. The
first builder sued the homeowner on a quasi-contract theory, seeking
compensation for the services that he rendered prior to the storm. The
first builder is entitled to receive

(A) the reasonable value of the work performed by the first builder,
less the difference between the price that the homeowner had
agreed to pay the first builder and the price that the homeowner
agreed to pay the second builder.

(B) the reasonable value of the work performed by the first builder.

(C) one-quarter of the price that the homeowner agreed to pay the first

builder for the completed greenhouse.

(D) nothing, since the homeowner has received no benefit from the first

builder's work.

117. The buyer agreed to purchase 300 commercial-grade metal screws

from the seller by a written contract that provided that the buyer would

318

make payment prior to inspection. The screws were delivered by truck
and were in a closed box. The buyer paid the truck driver before
inspecting the screws. Upon subsequent inspection, however, the buyer
discovered the screws were of domestic rather than commercial grade.
The buyer called the seller, offering to return the screws and
demanding return of his money. The seller refused to take the screws
back or give the buyer a refund. Which of the following is most correct
about the effect of the buyer's payment prior to inspection?

(A) The terms of the contract required an unconditional acceptance
prior to inspection, and payment constituted unconditional
acceptance.

(B) Even if the contract provision calling for payment prior to

inspection was invalid, payment resulted in a waiver of the right to
inspect prior to acceptance.

(C) Payment did not impair the buyer's right to inspect the goods prior

to acceptance.

(D) Payment constituted acceptance, but the buyer was entitled to
revoke acceptance within a reasonable time thereafter.

118. On August 1, a cell phone manufacturer posted a notice in the

employee lounge offering $200 to any employee who could design a
“killer app” by November 1, in time for the Christmas gift-buying
season. A designer employed by the manufacturer saw the notice and
immediately began working on a new phone application in his spare
time. On September 1, the manufacturer removed the old sign and
posted a new notice that said, “The offer of a cash prize for a ‘killer
app’ is hereby withdrawn.” On October 1, the designer submitted his
design for a “killer app,” which was eventually adopted for use by the
manufacturer. The manufacturer refused to pay any money to the
designer. If the designer asserts a claim against the manufacturer in a
jurisdiction that accepts the view expressed in the Restatement of
Contracts, Second, the designer's most effective argument will be that

(A) a bilateral contract was formed when the designer submitted the

design that the manufacturer eventually adopted.

(B) the designer relied on the offer contained in the first notice by
working on the design in his spare time prior to September 1.

(C) the promises contained in the first notice could not be withdrawn

until November 1.

319

(D) the company's attempt to withdraw its offer was unconscionable.

119. A hiker was hiking in the woods when she heard a cry for help. She
then saw a climber hanging from the edge of a cliff, clearly about to
fall. The hiker ran to the cliff's edge and pulled the climber to safety.
The climber was so happy that he said, “In token for saving my life, I
promise to pay you $100 the first of next month.” A few days later, the
climber died falling from another cliff. The jurisdiction has a “Good
Samaritan” statute. If the hiker institutes an action against the executor
of the climber's estate for the $100 that the climber promised to pay
her, the court should find for

(A) the hiker, because the jurisdiction has a “Good Samaritan” statute.

(B) the hiker, because she detrimentally relied on the climber's promise

to pay her.

(C) the climber's executor, because the climber's promise was

unsupported by consideration.

(D) the climber's executor, because it is impossible to calculate the

value of the hiker's services.

120. A parts dealer agreed to deliver a special bumper to a car collector's

home for $150. After the contract was signed, the dealer called the
collector and told him that he would not deliver the special bumper as
agreed. The collector succeeded in buying another one like it in
another town for $130, incurring reasonable travel expenses of $20 in
going to pick it up. In an action by the collector against the dealer, the
court should find for

(A) the collector, in the sum of $20.

(B) the collector, in the sum of $40.

(C) the collector, in the sum of $170.

(D) the dealer.

121. When his daughter was about to turn 21, a builder decided he wanted
to give her some money so she could buy a new car. Consequently, the
builder entered into a written contract with a homeowner to build a
new addition. In return, the homeowner agreed to pay the sum of
$5,000 to the builder's daughter on her birthday upon completion of the
work to his satisfaction. A few weeks before her birthday, the builder's
daughter married a circus clown, and the builder did not approve. The

320

builder asked the homeowner to pay the $5,000 to him directly, which
he did. On her birthday, the builder's daughter learned for the first time
of the written agreement between her father and the homeowner. The
daughter then commences a lawsuit against the homeowner. Will the
lawsuit succeed?

(A) No, because she gave no consideration for the homeowner's

promise to pay her.

(B) No, because the payment by the homeowner to the builder was the

result 
of an effective oral modification of the written contract.

(C) Yes, because the daughter is an intended donee beneficiary of the

contract between the builder and the homeowner.

(D) Yes, because the written contract between the builder and the
homeowner operated as an assignment to the daughter of the
builder's right to payment.

122. By a written agreement, a university agreed to buy 100 air conditioners
from a company at a price of $250 each, FOB the company's factory.
On June 1, the company loaded the air conditioners on a truck owned
by an independent trucking company. The company informed the
university that the air conditioners were on their way. Later that day,
the company assigned its rights under the contract to a parts
manufacturer to which it owed money. The university consented to this
assignment. On June 2, en route to the university, the truck fell off a
bridge and the entire shipment was destroyed. In an action by the
university against the company for damages resulting from the non-
delivery of the air conditioners, which of the following would be the
company's most effective argument in defense?

(A) There has been a valid assignment to the parts manufacturer.

(B) The risk of loss passed to the university when the air conditioners

were loaded onto the truck.

(C) The risk of loss passed to the trucking company when the air
conditioners were loaded onto the trucking company's truck.

(D) Performance of the contract was made impossible by the

destruction of the air conditioners.

123. The seller's grandfather left her a collection of the first 30 Super

Jimmy comics, the only Super Jimmy comics in existence. The seller

321

sold some comics and pop art in her art gallery, so she made up a
catalog showing pictures of the 30 comics, and on August 1, she sent a
copy of the catalog to a comic book dealer with a note:

I  know  how  much  you  love  Super  Jimmy,  so  I  wanted  to  give  you  a
chance  to  buy  some  of  the  comics  before  I  offer  them  to  any  other
dealers or collectors. The price is $200 per comic book, no matter how
many  you  buy.  E-mail  me  your  order  within  two  weeks,  or  I'll  put
them on the market.

On August 2, the dealer sent the seller an e-mail that said, “I accept
your offer to sell Super Jimmy Number 30 for $200. I will come to
your house in two days to pick up the comic and will pay you cash at
that time.” On August 3, after receiving the e-mail, the seller
telephoned the dealer and said that because of favorable publicity that
the collection had received, she would not sell Super Jimmy Number
30 for less than $300. The dealer agreed on the telephone to pay $300
for comic Number 30.

On August 4, the dealer sent an e-mail to the seller that said, “I accept
your offer to sell Super Jimmy comics 1 through 29 for $200 each. I
will pick up the comic books tomorrow and will pay for them at that
time.”

On August 5, the dealer showed up at the seller's home and tendered
payment of $200 each for all 30 comic books, but the seller refused to
sell her any of the comics except for Number 30, for which the seller
insisted the agreed price was $300. The dealer left without buying it.
The dealer sued for an order directing the seller to sell the dealer
comics 1 through 29 for $200 each. Which of the following would be
the seller's most effective argument in defense against that action?

(A) Since the dealer is a comic book dealer, there is an adequate

remedy at law.

(B) The seller's August 1 promise to keep the offer open for two weeks

was unsupported by consideration.

(C) The dealer's e-mail of August 2 was a rejection of the seller's offer

to sell comic books 1 through 29.

(D) The catalog and the seller's cover letter were mere invitations to

negotiate.

322

124. An importer of arts and crafts products from Russia sold his products
mainly to department stores and import shops. To keep his sales force
down, the importer did most of his selling by sending catalogs
describing products and prices to prospective customers and taking
orders by mail on forms provided with the catalogs. The forms
contained the phrase “10 percent discount on COD orders only.” After
receiving one of the catalogs, a coffee shop owner decided to order
some Russian coffeepots for sale in her store. The shop owner had
been doing business with the importer on an “open account” basis. On
July 27, she typed the following across the importer's order form:
“Send immediately 50 Russian coffeepots at 10 percent discount.
Payment within 10 days of receipt and acceptance.” The importer
received the order on July 29. On July 30, the importer shipped 50
coffeepots to the shop owner, who received and accepted them on
August 3. On July 31, the importer wrote to the shop owner, “I am
shipping pursuant to your request and will expect payment within 10
days. Since discounts apply only to COD shipments, you are herewith
billed at full price.” The shop owner received the letter and enclosed
bill on August 4. On August 5, the shop owner sent the importer a
check in payment of the amount billed, less 10 percent. If the importer
asserts a claim against the shop owner for the balance of the amount
billed, the court should find for

(A) the importer, because the shop owner's order was on the importer's

order form.

(B) the importer, because the shop owner was aware that the importer's
catalog and order form specified that the 10 percent discount
applied only to COD shipments.

(C) the shop owner, because she had been doing business with the

importer on an “open account” basis.

(D) the shop owner, because the importer accepted her offer to

purchase at a 10 percent discount.

125. A landowner wanted to open a miniature golf course on a parcel of
real estate that he owned. After negotiation, the landowner hired a
builder to build the golf course and a waterslide. The landowner and
the builder entered into a written contract by which the builder agreed
to begin construction on August 1, to be finished with everything
except the waterslide by November 1, and to complete construction of
the waterslide by December 15. The contract price was $150,000 to

323

be paid as follows: $50,000 on August 1; $50,000 upon completion of
everything but the waterslide; and the balance of $50,000 upon
completion of the waterslide. The builder began work on August 1,
after receiving $50,000 from the landowner. By November 1, the
builder completed construction of everything but the waterslide in
accordance with the specifications. The landowner paid $50,000 to the
builder on November 1, and the builder began construction of the
waterslide, but before it was completed, the builder informed the
landowner that he would not finish the job. Which of the following
statements is correct concerning the landowner's rights against the
builder?

(A) The landowner may recover all payments that he has made to the

builder.

(B) The landowner may recover from the builder the reasonable cost of

completing the waterslide.

(C) The landowner may recover all payments that he has made to the
builder and the reasonable cost of completing the waterslide.

(D) The landowner is not entitled to recover the payments or the

reasonable cost of completing the waterslide.

126. The buyer went to a car dealer to look at some of the cars on display.
Selecting a car, he began negotiating with the dealer. The dealer
offered to sell him the car that was on display in the showroom, but the
buyer said that he wanted to buy a new one. The dealer explained that
the display model was the only one she had, but she was planning to
order some new ones from the manufacturer anyway and would order
one for the buyer if he agreed to purchase it. The buyer and the dealer
entered into a written contract for the sale of a new car at a price of
$10,000, to be paid on delivery within two weeks. The following day,
the dealer ordered 10 new cars from the manufacturer, and the buyer
purchased materials and began building a garage for the car.

One week after contracting with the buyer, the dealer notified him that
the new car was ready for delivery, and the buyer went immediately to
the dealer's showroom to take delivery of it. The buyer tendered his
own personal check in payment of the purchase price, but the dealer
refused to accept it. Which of the following most accurately describes
the legal rights and obligations of the parties upon such refusal by the
dealer?

324

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

(A) The buyer's tender of a check discharged the dealer's obligation

under the contract, since an agreement that is silent as to the manner
of payment is presumed to call for payment in cash.

(B) The buyer's tender of a check discharged the dealer's obligation
under the contract unless the buyer tendered payment in cash
immediately upon being informed of the dealer's refusal to accept
the buyer's check.

(C) The buyer's tender of a check did not discharge the dealer's

obligation under the contract, but the dealer's obligation will be
discharged if the buyer fails to tender cash within a reasonable
time.

(D) The dealer's refusal to accept a check discharged the buyer's

obligation under the contract, since an agreement that is silent as to
the manner of payment is presumed to call for payment in any
manner current in the ordinary course of business.

127. In preparation for a big convention to be held on June 16, the
convention committee ordered 500 bobblehead dolls from the
company at a total price of $500, paying for them in advance. Because
the bobbleheads were to be given to conventioneers as souvenirs, they
were to be imprinted with the name and slogan of the convention and
were to be delivered to the committee on or before June 15. The
company and the committee entered into a written contract containing
the above terms on May 1. The company tendered 475 bobbleheads to
the committee on June 15. The committee instituted an action against
the company for breach of contract. If only one of the following
additional facts were true, which would furnish the company with its
most effective defense to that action?

(A) The company was unable to obtain necessary materials from its
suppliers in time for production of 500 bobbleheads by June 15.

(B) The committee failed to serve the company with notice of its

intention to sue before instituting the action.

(C) Only 400 conventioneers attended the convention.

(D) On June 1, the company advised the committee that it would only
be able to deliver 475 bobbleheads, and the committee orally
agreed to reduce the order to that number.

128. On June 1, a licensed real estate broker entered into a written contract

325

with a homeowner. According to the contract, the broker was given the
exclusive right to sell the homeowner's home at a price of $100,000
for a period of three months. The homeowner agreed to pay the broker
a 7 percent commission “upon transfer of title.” The broker went to
work looking for a buyer.

On August 1, the homeowner entered into a written contract with a
buyer for the purchase and sale of the homeowner's home at a price of
$98,000, with title to close on December 1. The broker was unaware
of the transaction and did not participate in it. On November 1, the
buyer informed the homeowner that he would not be going through
with the deal.

The broker sued the homeowner for a 7 percent commission based on
the homeowner's contract with the buyer. Which of the following
would be the homeowner's most effective argument in defense against
the broker's claim?

(A) The price that the buyer agreed to pay for the purchase of the

homeowner's home was $98,000.

(B) Transfer of title was not to take place until after the three-month

period of the broker's exclusive right to sell.

(C) As a result of the buyer's conduct, transfer of title never took place.

(D) The broker did not participate in the formation of the homeowner's

contract with the buyer.

129. When the plaintiff was accepted to law school, her mother was so

proud of the plaintiff that she said, “If you successfully complete your
first year, I'll buy all your books for the following two years and give
you $250 for each ‘A.’ ” The plaintiff's mother died while the plaintiff
was in her first year of law school, but the plaintiff succeeded in
earning two “A”s in her first year and completed school in two
additional years. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against her mother's
executrix for the cost of the books that she purchased in her second and
third year of law school, which of the following would be the
executrix's most effective argument in defense against the plaintiff's
claim?

(A) The agreement between the plaintiff and her mother was divisible.

(B) The agreement between the plaintiff and her mother was not in

326

writing.

(C) The mother's offer was for payment of a cash bonus.

(D) The mother's promise was unsupported by consideration.

130. A man developed a new phone application that allowed users to

follow the records of their favorite college teams. A company liked the
application and offered the man a job as an in-house designer and 30
percent of the application's revenues if the man would give the
company the exclusive right to market and sell the application. The
man and the company agreed to the arrangement. Soon thereafter, the
man assigned his rights in the contract to the plaintiff in return for some
music equipment. A week after that, the man assigned his rights under
the contract to a software company.

Three months later, the company offered to pay the man $50,000 for all
rights to the application if the man would consent to a mutual
rescission of the contract. The man accepted the offer and received a
payment of $50,000. If the plaintiff subsequently institutes an action
against the company for a sum equivalent to 30 percent of the revenues
derived from the sale of the application, the court should find for

(A) the company, because the rights under which the plaintiff is

claiming were subsequently assigned to the software company.

(B) the company, because the company was unaware of the assignment

to the plaintiff at the time it paid $50,000 to the man.

(C) the company, because the right that the man purported to assign to

the plaintiff was neither identified nor existing at the time of the
purported assignment.

(D) the plaintiff, because he gave value for the right that the man

assigned to him.

131. A woman, who had a son and daughter, agreed to deed to her daughter
her farm so long as the daughter agreed to allow her brother to live on
it for as long as he wished. The daughter agreed, but she did not tell
her brother about their mother's condition that he be allowed to live on
the farm.

The woman's sister lived in the same town. She had always wanted the
woman's son, her only nephew, to live near her, so she wrote him a
letter, telling him that if he moved to the town, she would give him her

327

estate when she died. The son, who knew the farm was deeded to his
sister, told his sister that if she would let him live on the farm until
their aunt died, he would give his sister half of what he received from
the aunt. She agreed, and her brother moved onto the farm. The aunt
passed away soon thereafter.

The aunt's will left her entire estate to the son, but the son refused to
share any portion of it with his sister. If the daughter asserts a claim
against her brother for a share of the inheritance that he received from
their aunt, a court should find for

(A) the daughter, because her brother is estopped from denying the

existence of an enforceable contract between him and his sister.

(B) the daughter, because her brother promised to share the inheritance
with her if she promised to allow him to live on the farm until their
aunt's death.

(C) the son, because his sister's promise to their mother created an

implied condition precedent to her brother's obligation to share the
inheritance with his sister.

(D) the son, because his promise to his sister was not supported by

consideration.

132. The homeowner hired the defendant to maintain his lawn, agreeing to
pay him $50 per month for certain specified services. Two months
later, the homeowner sold his house to the plaintiff. At the closing of
title, the homeowner handed the plaintiff the original memorandum of
his agreement with the defendant and executed an assignment to the
plaintiff of his rights thereunder. The defendant continued rendering
services as agreed for an additional six months, receiving a check for
$50 from the plaintiff each month. Then, the defendant notified the
plaintiff that he would no longer be able to work on the lawn.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for breaching the agreement contained
in the memorandum. The court should find for

(A) the defendant, because the payment by the plaintiff did not result in

a novation.

(B) the defendant, because his only agreement was with the

homeowner.

(C) the defendant, because no consideration flowed from the plaintiff to

328

the homeowner in exchange for the memorandum.

(D) the plaintiff, as assignee of the agreement between the homeowner

and the defendant.

133. When the homeowner purchased her home, she obtained a fire

insurance policy. The policy provided that if the home was destroyed
or seriously damaged by fire, the insurance company would pay
“living expenses necessitated by the loss” until the homeowner's house
was rebuilt or she acquired another house, but in no event for a period
in excess of 90 days. The policy stated that since it was often
impracticable to distinguish between normal living expenses and those
necessitated by fire loss, the insurance company's liability for “living
expenses necessitated by the loss” was fixed at $50 per day.

Subsequently, the homeowner's home was seriously damaged by fire.
The homeowner moved into a hotel and entered into a written contract
with a contractor for repairs to her home. The contract required
payment in advance by the homeowner and completion of repairs by
the contractor within 60 days. One of its clauses provided that if the
contractor failed to complete the job on time, the contractor would pay
the homeowner the sum of $50 per day as liquidated damages. It took
the contractor 70 days to complete the job.

The insurance company paid the homeowner $3,000 (60 days at $50
per day), but refused to pay the additional $500 for the 10-day period
caused by the contractor's late performance. If the homeowner sues the
insurance company for $500, the court should find for

(A) the homeowner, because the insurance company agreed to pay $50

per day until the homeowner's house was reconstructed.

(B) the homeowner, because she can establish that her “living expenses
necessitated by the loss” exceeded whatever amount she was
entitled to receive from the contractor.

(C) the homeowner, because at the time the fire insurance policy was

issued to the homeowner, it reasonably appeared that the
homeowner would expend approximately $50 per day in “living
expenses necessitated by the loss” in the event of fire damage to
her home.

(D) the insurance company, because the homeowner is estopped by the
liquidated damages clause in her contract with the contractor from

329

asserting that her “living expenses necessitated by the loss”
exceeded $50 per day.

134. Proud of a local painter's accomplishments, the town council voted to
erect a statue commemorating the painter's victory over his social and
economic disadvantages. Pursuant to town ordinances and regulations,
bids were accepted from several artists, including the sculptor.
Because the sculptor's work was relatively unknown, she attempted to
make her bid more attractive to the council by including a guarantee
that her work would be satisfactory. On February 1, the town council
entered into a written contract with the sculptor, hiring her to create the
statue and agreeing to pay her $5,000 upon its installation on the steps
of the town hall on or before June 30. A clause in the contract
provided, “It is expressly understood that the personal satisfaction of
the mayor is a condition precedent to the council's obligation to make
payment hereunder. Upon completion of the statue, it shall be made
available for inspection by said mayor. If said mayor is unsatisfied
with the work, he shall notify the sculptor immediately, and the
contract shall be canceled without liability of any party.”

The sculptor sculpted a likeness of the painter in farmer's overalls
with a paintbrush in his teeth, which she completed on June 10. The
painter had been arrested in another state on May 30, however, and
charged with possession of a dangerous drug. His trial was scheduled
for September 10.

At the same time, an art collector came to town, saw the statue, and
offered to buy it from the sculptor for $6,000. Fearful that the painter's
pending trial would induce the mayor to reject her statue, the sculptor
immediately accepted the offer, notifying the town council on June 10
that she would not be submitting a statue for the mayor's approval. In
an action by the town council against the sculptor, the court should find
for

(A) the town council, because the sculptor has committed an

anticipatory breach.

(B) the town council, because the statue that the sculptor created might

have met with the mayor's satisfaction.

(C) the town council, because the price that she received from the art

collector exceeded $5,000.

330

(D) the sculptor, because the town council's promise under the contract

was illusory.

135. By a written contract, the owner of a bar agreed to purchase 200

pounds of large pickled eggs from a farmer at a specified price. A term
of the contract provided that “payment shall be due immediately on
delivery and prior to inspection of the shipment.” When a box
containing the eggs was delivered, the bar owner paid the agreed price
without inspecting its contents. One hour later, the bar owner opened
the box and discovered that it contained small eggs rather than large
eggs. When the bar owner called the farmer to ask that the farmer
exchange the small eggs for large ones, the farmer refused. The bar
owner repackaged the eggs and returned them to the farmer.
Subsequently, the bar owner asserted a claim against the farmer for
breach of contract.

If the bar owner succeeds in an action against the farmer for breach of
contract, a court is most likely to

(A) issue an order directing the farmer to deliver 200 pounds of large

pickled eggs as required by the contract.

(B) award damages consisting of the difference between the value of

large eggs and small eggs.

(C) award damages consisting of the purchase price plus the difference
between the contract price and the market price for large eggs.

(D) require the farmer to return the money that the bar owner paid.

136. The buyer, who was planning to go to law school, told the seller that

he might need some law books. The seller had recently inherited a law
library, so he compiled a list of the books in the collection and mailed
it to the buyer on July 5 with a note that said, “Interested in buying?”
The buyer wrote back to the seller and told him that he would buy the
books if the seller delivered them to his home on September 1.

The seller received the letter on Wednesday, July 9, and immediately
responded by writing, “I accept your offer to buy my library and will
deliver it to you as you require.” He signed the letter and mailed it
properly addressed to the buyer, but due to a fire in the post office, it
was never delivered. When the seller delivered the books on
September 1, the buyer refused to accept them.

331

If the seller instituted an action against the buyer for breach of
contract, which of the following statements is most correct about the
seller's letter of July 9?

(A) It bound both parties to a unilateral contract when it was mailed.

(B) It formed a bilateral contract when mailed because the buyer chose

the mail as the medium of communication.

(C) The letter would have constituted an acceptance if it had been

received, but because it was not received, no contract was formed.

(D) The seller's mailing of the letter did not prevent the buyer from

withdrawing his offer.

137. Because the buyer was arranging to move his family across the country
on April 20, the buyer insisted that the contract for his new home
contain a liquidated damages clause. The clause provided that if the
new home was not ready for occupancy on April 20, the seller would
pay the buyer $75 for each day thereafter that it remained unavailable
for occupancy. When the buyer and his family moved on April 20, the
home was not ready for occupancy. As a result, the buyer and his
family had to stay at a motel. On May 1, the seller advised the buyer
that he did not intend to go through with the sale of this house. On May
10, the buyer instituted an action against the seller for specific
performance and damages pursuant to the liquidated damages clause.

With respect to the buyer's demand for damages pursuant to the
contract's liquidated damages clause, the court's finding will turn on
whether

(A) the motel at which the buyer stayed charged a rate that was

commercially reasonable.

(B) the buyer could have avoided staying at a motel by making a

reasonable attempt to mitigate damages.

(C) at the time the contract was formed, the sum of $75 per day was

reasonably related to what the parties believed the buyer's living
expenses would be.

(D) the buyer's purpose in insisting on a liquidated damages clause was

to encourage the seller to vacate the premises on time.

138. A man, who had been studying the writings of various saints, decided
to sell all his worldly possessions, give the money to charity, and hike

332

for a while to seek insight and spiritual fulfillment. After about a
month, the man became ill and collapsed into unconsciousness. When
he awoke, he was in the home of a retired surgeon who now lived like
a hermit in the mountains, and who had found him in a helpless
condition. As the doctor fed garlic soup to the man, the man said, “I
have no money. I can never pay you for any of this.” The doctor
replied, “I'm not doing this for money.”

In the next week, the doctor fed the man and gave him medical
treatment. When the man was well enough to travel, the doctor
borrowed an old pickup truck from a distant neighbor and drove the
man to the house of the man's mother. The following week, after the
man told his mother what the doctor did for him, the man's mother
wrote the doctor: “In gratitude for the services that you rendered my
son, I hereby promise to pay you $350.00 when I get my dividend
check next month.” Before the dividend check arrived, however, both
the man's mother and the doctor died. The doctor's administrator
advised the mother's husband of the letter that his wife had sent and
indicated that he intended to make a claim against her estate for $350.

After a discussion with the administrator, in which the administrator
agreed not to assert a claim against the mother's estate, the husband
prepared a document that read, “In consideration of services rendered
by the doctor to my wife's son, and of the administrator's promise to
make no claim against the estate of my wife, I hereby agree to pay
$350.00 to the doctor's estate.” After signing the document, the
husband handed it to the administrator. The husband never paid
anything to the estate, however, and the administrator instituted suit
against him. The husband defended on the ground that his promise to
pay $350 was not supported by consideration.

Were the services rendered by the doctor sufficient consideration for
the husband's promise?

(A) They are sufficient consideration because they imposed a

preexisting moral obligation on the husband.

(B) They are not sufficient consideration because they were not

requested by the husband.

(C) The question of whether or not they are sufficient consideration

depends on whether the husband received any material benefit from

333

them.

(D) The question of whether or not they are sufficient consideration
depends upon whether the reasonable value of the services
approximated $350.

139. On September 10, the company, a well-known publisher of law books,
posted a notice in the law school bookstore that it would award
$10,000 to the student with the highest grade point average.

A student, who had just begun her final year at the law school, saw the
notice. Her grades already placed her toward the top of her class, but
she resolved to work harder than ever before in an attempt to win the
company's award. On September 20, she mailed a letter to the
company saying, “I accept your offer for the award and will do my
best to win it.” The following May, because of budget cutbacks, the
company posted a new notice at the law school stating that it would
not be presenting any awards.

In a jurisdiction that applies the Restatement of Contracts, 2d rule, a
court's decision as to whether the company's offer was effectively
revoked by the notice posted in May will most likely depend on
whether

(A) the student saw the second notice before taking her exams.

(B) the second notice was as large and as conspicuously posted as the

first.

(C) the student's letter of September 20 was effective when mailed or

when received.

(D) the student made extra efforts in her studies in reliance on the

September 10 notice.

140. When a landowner's daughter and a painting contractor's son

announced that they were getting married, the landowner and the
contractor decided to give them a house as a wedding present. On
January 1, the two men entered into a written agreement with each
other, pursuant to which they were to have a house built on the
landowner's lot, with the landowner and the contractor each paying
half the cost. It was further agreed that after completion of the house,
the contractor would pay the landowner $10,000 as his share of the
cost of the lot, and the landowner would convey the lot to their

334

children.

On February 2, the two men entered into a written contract with a
builder. The contract called for payment in installments, each payment
being due upon completion of a specified stage of building. In addition
to its other terms, the contract contained a clause providing that as
each payment came due, the builder would bill and collect half the
payment from the landowner and half from the contractor. In the
contract, the builder agreed that neither would be responsible to him
for more than half the price.

On March 3, the contractor entered into a separate contract with the
builder. Pursuant to this contract, the builder hired the contractor as a
subcontractor to do all the painting required in connection with the
construction of the house. Because the house was being built for his
son, the contractor agreed to do the job for $3,000, although his work
was worth $5,000. The $3,000 was to be deducted from the final
payment that the contractor would owe the builder for construction of
the house.

In April, the contractor became ill. Because he could no longer work,
he sold his painting business to his son, a competent and licensed
painting contractor, for about half of what it was actually worth. As
one of the terms of the contract of sale, the contractor's son promised
to do all the painting work on the house that the builder was
constructing. The contractor notified the builder of his agreement with
his son. When the house was ready to be painted, however, the
contractor's son informed the builder that he would not paint it.

The landowner then decided he did not want to convey the property to
his daughter and the contractor's son. The contractor's son then sued
the landowner. Which of the following arguments would furnish the
landowner with his strongest defense?

(A) The contractor's son did not rely or assent to the contract of January

1 between the landowner and the contractor.

(B) The contractor's son's painting of the house was a condition

precedent to the landowner's obligation to convey.

(C) The contractor's son was only an incidental beneficiary of the

January 1 contract between the landowner and the contractor since

335

the landowner's primary intention was to benefit his daughter.

(D) The contract that the contractor made with the builder on March 3
was a breach of a fiduciary obligation that the contractor owed the
landowner.

141. The seller and the buyer had been friends for years. The seller was the
owner of a rare guitar, which the buyer had offered to buy from her on
several occasions but which the seller had never been willing to sell.
On the buyer's birthday, the seller and the buyer went out for dinner
and drinks. After dinner, the seller continued drinking until she was
somewhat intoxicated. During their conversation, the seller said, “As a
birthday present, I've decided that I'm going to sell you my guitar for
$500. And just to make sure that I don't change my mind after I sober
up, I'll put it in writing.” With that, she wrote on a paper napkin, “We
agree to the sale of my guitar to the buyer for $500, COD,” and signed
her name at the bottom. The buyer also signed the napkin and put it in
her purse. The following day, the buyer tendered $500 in cash to the
seller, but the seller refused to sell her the guitar, claiming that she had
been drunk when she made the offer. If the buyer is successful in an
action against the seller, a court is most likely to

(A) issue an order directing the seller to sell the buyer the guitar for

$500.

(B) award damages equivalent to the reasonable market value of the

guitar.

(C) issue an order directing the seller to sell her guitar for $500 and
award damages equivalent to the reasonable market value of the
seller's guitar less $500.

(D) award damages of $500.

142. The plaintiff had long admired the defendant's dog, which was trained
to get the paper and start the coffeepot every morning. The plaintiff
finally convinced the defendant to agree to sell him the dog, and the
defendant wrote out a contract that said, “I agree to sell my dog to the
plaintiff. Price to be decided at delivery.” The plaintiff was seeking to
purchase the dog for resale. When the plaintiff arrived to pick up the
dog a week later, the defendant refused to give the dog to him. The
plaintiff then filed suit. Does the UCC apply to the transaction between
the plaintiff and the defendant?

(A) Yes, because this was a transaction in goods.

336

(B) Yes, because the price and the delivery date terms were missing

from the agreement.

(C) No, because, unless it is a farm animal, a living thing does not fit

the definition of “goods” under the UCC.

(D) No, because the plaintiff was seeking to purchase the dog for

resale.

143. An attorney decided to invest $4,000 in art for her office. On

November 1, she decided to purchase a painting from the defendant,
with delivery to be made to the attorney on December 28 after the
painting was framed.

On November 15, the attorney learned that the defendant had
accidentally sold the painting to another buyer. Based on this
knowledge, the attorney gave another art dealer $4,000 to purchase
another painting.

On November 30, the defendant learned of the mistake and got the
painting back from the other buyer. On December 28, when the
defendant arrived at the attorney's office with the framed painting, the
attorney refused to accept it.

The attorney instituted an action against the defendant on December 29
seeking specific performance of the November 1 agreement. With
respect to the attorney's demand for specific performance, a court is
most likely to find for

(A) the defendant, since the attorney refused to accept delivery of the

painting on December 28.

(B) the defendant, since the attorney has already succeeded in investing

$4,000 in art for her office.

(C) the attorney, since the painting is unique.

(D) the attorney, since the defendant's sale to the other person was an

anticipatory repudiation of its contract with the attorney.

144. The seller was the owner of a lot and building that contained two

residential apartments. The seller resided in the upstairs apartment and
rented the downstairs apartment to a tenant and his family on a month-
to-month basis. The buyer was interested in purchasing the realty from

337

the seller. After negotiations, the buyer and the seller entered into a
written contract that provided that the seller would sell the house to the
buyer for $60,000 and that delivery of title was to occur on or before
August 1. The seller promised that at the time title was delivered, the
upstairs apartment would be vacant and that the downstairs apartment
would be vacant within three months thereafter. The buyer promised to
pay $58,000 upon delivery of title and the balance of $2,000 three
months after delivery of title. The contract provided that “The buyer's
obligation to pay $2,000 three months after delivery of title shall be
voided if the downstairs apartment has not been vacated by that time.”

The seller delivered title to the buyer on August 1, and as of
November 15, the downstairs apartment remained occupied by the
tenant. Which of the following statements best describes the buyer's
rights?

(A) The buyer is entitled to an order directing the seller to commence a
legal proceeding against the tenant for the purpose of evicting him
from the premises.

(B) The buyer is not required to pay the seller the additional $2,000.

(C) The buyer is entitled to rescind his contract with the seller,

reconveying title to her and receiving the return of his $58,000.

(D) The buyer may bring a legal proceeding for the purpose of evicting
the tenant from the premises, and, if successful, is required to pay
the seller $2,000 less the expenses he incurred in evicting the
tenant.

145. The buyer was a collector of antiques who had purchased many

expensive pieces from the seller, an antiques dealer. Knowing that the
seller was traveling to Europe, the buyer wrote to him on March 11,
“If you should come across a good piece in your travels, please
purchase it for me. I don't care about the cost.”

On April 17, the seller wrote to the buyer, “I have found an excellent
table. The price is $15,000, but I think it's a good buy. Are you still
interested? If so, let me know if the price is acceptable to you.” The
next day, for personal reasons, the seller decided he did not want to
sell to the buyer.

The buyer received the seller's letter on April 21, and, on that same

338

day, e-mailed the seller, “Fifteen thousand is OK. Buy the piece on my
account.”

The seller later sold the piece to another buyer who offered more
money.

In litigation between the buyer and seller, if a court determines that the
seller's letter of April 17 was an offer, was a contract formed between
the buyer and the seller?

(A) Yes, because sending an e-mail was a reasonable way for the buyer

to accept the seller's offer.

(B) Yes, because, as a merchant, the seller was obligated to act in good

faith.

(C) No, because an offer sent by mail may be accepted only by mail.

(D) No, because the seller changed his mind about the piece prior to

April 21.

146. A banking firm hired a computer-banking specialist to update its
computer network for $15,000. The specialist then went to work
installing hardware and writing special software for the firm. Soon
thereafter, to pay off a debt that the specialist owed to a computer
programmer, the specialist assigned to the computer programmer her
rights to receive payment under the contract. After the work was
completed, the firm refused to pay.

The computer programmer instituted a claim against the firm for
$15,000. Which one of the following additional facts or inferences, if
it were the only one true, would be most likely to lead to a judgment
for the firm?

(A) The programmer was not a specialist in the application of computer

technology to the practice of banking.

(B) The contract between the specialist and the firm did not contain a

clause permitting assignment.

(C) The contract between the specialist and the firm contained language
that stated, “This contract may not be modified except by a writing
signed by both parties hereto.”

(D) The firm paid $15,000 to the specialist prior to being notified of

339

the specialist's assignment to the programmer.

147. The defendant was a veterinarian who sometimes acquired exotic

animals from local zoos. The plaintiff was the owner of a large
livestock ranch.

On March 10, the defendant and the plaintiff agreed that the defendant
would sell the plaintiff an aardvark for $450, payment and delivery to
be on March 20. On March 15, the plaintiff called the defendant and
said, “When you deliver the aardvark, will you throw in a pig for my
daughter without charging extra for it?” The defendant said, “Yes,” but
when she delivered the aardvark on March 20, she refused to give the
daughter a pig. If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant
because of her failure to deliver the pig as promised, the court should
find for

(A) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff and the defendant were merchants

with respect to the sale of a pig.

(B) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff and the defendant were merchants

with respect to the sale of an aardvark.

(C) the plaintiff, because the plaintiff and the defendant were merchants

with respect to the sale of an aardvark and a pig.

(D) the plaintiff.

148. On January 3, a retailer of lumber ordered from a lumber wholesaler

1,000 2” × 4” fir boards, each 8 feet in length, for delivery by January
15. When the wholesaler delivered the fir boards on January 15, they
were received by the retailer's manager, who informed the retailer that
delivery was made but that the boards delivered by the wholesaler
were only 7 feet long. The retailer intended to notify the wholesaler
immediately but was busy and forgot to do so.

On January 16, economic conditions caused the price of lumber to
double, and on January 17, the retailer notified the wholesaler that the
boards were only 7 feet long, returned them to the wholesaler, and
demanded that the wholesaler furnish 8-foot boards at the contract
price. If the wholesaler refuses to do so, and the retailer asserts a
claim against the wholesaler for breach of contract, the court should
find for

(A) the retailer, in a sum equivalent to the difference between the

340

contract price and the fair market value of 7-foot boards on January
15.

(B) the retailer, in a sum equivalent to the difference between the

contract price and the fair market value of 8-foot boards on January
15.

(C) the retailer, in a sum equivalent to the difference between the

contract price and the fair market value of 8-foot boards on January
17.

(D) the wholesaler.

149. A pawnbroker occasionally sold used jewelry to the buyer, who

owned a jewelry store. On June 1, the pawnbroker sold the buyer a
ring for $2,500, representing the stone in it to be a diamond. On July
16, the buyer learned that the stone in the ring that he had purchased
from the pawnbroker was not a diamond but rather cubic zirconia,
making the ring worth only $300.

On July 17, the pawnbroker assigned to a retailer, for $1,500 cash, the
sales contract with the buyer. The retailer then requested payment from
the buyer. The buyer refused.

The retailer sued the buyer, but in defense, the buyer claimed the stone
was not a diamond, and the suit was unsuccessful. If the retailer brings
an action against the pawnbroker, the court should find for

(A) the pawnbroker, because an assignment does not imply a warranty

that the obligor will perform.

(B) the pawnbroker, because the assignment to the retailer caused the
retailer to step into the pawnbroker's shoes with respect to the
claim against the buyer.

(C) the retailer, because the buyer's defense existed at the time the
assignment was made by the pawnbroker to the retailer.

(D) the retailer, because an assignment for consideration implies a

warranty that the obligor will perform.

150. In anticipation of changing over to a more “upscale” restaurant, a

restaurant entered into a written agreement with a new butcher. Under
the agreement, the butcher would provide “as many top quality steaks
at $10 per pound as the restaurant decides to order.” A week later,

341

before the restaurant had made its first order, the butcher called the
restaurant and said that a sharp rise in the price of cattle feed meant
that it was impossible to provide “top quality” steaks for less than $15
per pound. The butcher said he was willing to provide lower quality
steaks if the restaurant wanted to keep the price the same. The
restaurant responded that it was already planning to host the National
Meat Eater's Convention and could only do so if it had top quality
steaks. The restaurant sued the butcher for breach.

How should the court rule?

(A) In favor of the restaurant, because of its detrimental reliance.

(B) In favor of the restaurant, because this is a valid requirements

contract.

(C) In favor of the butcher, under the doctrine of impossibility.

(D) In favor of the butcher, because the restaurant's promise is illusory.

151. On February 1, the landlord and the tenant entered into a written

contract. By its terms, the landlord was to rent the tenant a building for
use by the tenant as a “sports book,” which is an establishment where
bets are made on horse races and other sporting events. The tenant's
tenancy was to commence on April 1 and to continue for a period of
two years. Upon signing the contract on February 1, the tenant gave the
landlord a deposit of $2,000. At that time, neither party could have
reasonably anticipated that existing state law would be changed.

On February 1, existing state law permitted the operation of a sports
book, but on April 1, existing state law prohibited the operation of a
sports book. If the tenant sues the landlord for the return of his deposit,
the court should find for

(A) the landlord, because public policy prohibits the enforcement of

gambling contracts.

(B) the landlord, because the purpose of the agreement of February 1

has become illegal.

(C) the tenant, because he and the landlord were not in pari delicto.

(D) the tenant, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

152. In January, a farmer planted an orchard of apples that would be ready

for harvest in June. The farmer entered into a written contract with a

342

restaurant on March 2, wherein the farmer agreed to sell and the
restaurant agreed to buy 2,000 bushels of apples to be delivered during
the month of June.

In the first week of April, heavy rains inundated the farmer's orchard,
destroying part of her crop. As a result, she doubted that she would be
able to fulfill her contract with the restaurant. On April 15, she called
the restaurant and said that because of the storms, she would not be
able to deliver more than 1,000 bushels. The restaurant said, “I'll take
whatever you deliver, but I intend to hold you to the terms of our
contract.” However, immediately after the call, the restaurant
contracted to purchase from another supplier 1,000 bushels of apples
with delivery on June 15.

On June 15, the farmer delivered 2,000 bushels to the restaurant, but
the restaurant refused to accept any more than 1,000 bushels. If the
farmer sues the restaurant for breach of contract, the restaurant's most
effective defense would be based on the principle of

(A) novation.

(B) anticipatory repudiation.

(C) nudum pactum.

(D) impossibility of performance.

153. A developer entered into a written agreement with a farmer to buy the
farmer's farm for $500,000. The closing was scheduled for September
5. On September 1, the farmer called the developer and said, “I can't
go through with this. The farm means too much to me. Can we just
forget about the contract?” The developer, who was suddenly
interested in buying a different property, said it was fine if the farmer
wanted out. On September 2, the other property was sold to a
homebuilder. On September 3, the developer called the farmer back
and said, “Look, I want to go through with our original closing.” The
farmer said, “You agreed to cancel our contract, and I'm already
talking about selling to someone else for twice the price.”

If the developer sues the farmer for breach of contract, may she
recover?

(A) Yes, because any contract modification had to be in writing.

343

(B) Yes, because the farmer did not act in good faith.

(C) No, because the developer told the farmer it was fine if the farmer

wanted out.

(D) No, because the farmer acted in reliance on the developer's

statements.

154. A sporting goods store called a distributor and ordered 200 football

jerseys at $50 a piece. Three days later, the distributor sent the store a
signed letter marked “Confirmation.” The letter repeated the sales
terms from the phone conversation and said, “This confirms your order
of 200 football jerseys, total price $10,000.” The store received and
read the letter on January 3. The jerseys arrived on January 4. On
January 14, the store called and told the distributor, “We never agreed
to buy these jerseys. We're sending them back.”

Is the agreement enforceable?

(A) Yes, because the agreement is between merchants.

(B) Yes, because the distributor provided consideration by sending the

jerseys.

(C) No, because the agreement violates the Statute of Frauds.

(D) No, because the store told the distributor it didn't order the jerseys

within 14 days of receipt of the letter.

155. A woman's father earned his living as a fumigator, using a fleet of

trucks to fumigate office buildings with insecticides for a fee. When he
died, he left the business to his daughter. Although his daughter did not
know how to drive a truck and did not personally participate in
fumigating, she continued to run the business by hiring workers to
drive the trucks and fumigate the buildings. Soon after inheriting the
business, the woman entered into a business contract with a bank. The
terms of the contract required the woman's company to fumigate the
bank's building four times per year for a period of four years, at a total
price of $10,000 that the bank paid upon signing the contract.

The fumigation company performed as agreed for two years. At the
end of that period, the woman sold the entire business to a local
trucker, assigning to the trucker the balance of her contract with the
bank. All the daughter's employees agreed to work for the trucker.

344

The bank consented to the assignment, but the trucker subsequently
failed to perform as required by the contract. If the bank seeks the
return of the unearned portion of the money that it paid to the woman
on the signing of their contract, it may collect it from

(A) the woman only.

(B) the trucker only.

(C) either the woman or the trucker.

(D) neither the woman nor the trucker, because the bank's only remedy
is a judgment for the difference between the contract price and the
price that the bank would have to pay another for the same service.

156. During negotiations with a printing company, a publisher agreed to hire
the printing company president's wife as a cover artist for a year in
exchange for a lower rate on printing costs. The artist was thrilled and
immediately told all her clients that she wouldn't be able to work for
them. Six months later, after the president and the artist were divorced,
the president called the publisher and said that it could fire the artist if
it chose to do so, with no ramifications to the contract. The publisher
immediately fired the artist.

If the artist asserts a claim against the publisher for damages resulting
from breach of his promise to hire the artist for one year, the court
should find for

(A) the artist.

(B) the publisher, because the artist gave nothing in return for his

promise.

(C) the publisher, because his promise was not in writing.

(D) the publisher, because he and the president mutually rescinded their

contract.

157. After serving in the military for several years, a soldier informed her
father that she had gotten married and was retiring from military
service. Glad to hear the news, the soldier's father agreed to give the
soldier a house built on his land as a present. Thrilled with the gift, the
soldier cancelled her contract to buy another house.

The father and a builder signed an agreement to build a new house,
and the father showed the plans to the soldier. However, after

345

beginning the work, the builder discovered that the house could not be
built for what the father was willing to pay. Consequently, the father
and the builder agreed to a smaller plan for the house.

If the soldier asserts a claim against her father for changing the
building plans, which of the following would be the most effective
argument in support of her claim?

(A) The modification of the father's contract with the builder was

unsupported by consideration.

(B) The soldier detrimentally relied on her father's oral promise by
canceling the contract that she had already made to purchase a
home.

(C) The contract between the father and the builder was a writing

signed by the father.

(D) The soldier's marriage and retirement from military service was

consideration for her father's promise to give her a house built
according to the plans that he showed her.

158. On January 17, a storeowner agreed to sell a penguin-shaped ring to
the plaintiff for $2,000. However, when the plaintiff came to pick up
the ring on January 18, the storeowner refused to sell it to him. If the
plaintiff sues the storeowner, is the plaintiff entitled to specific
performance of the sale?

(A) No, because specific performance is not available as a remedy for

breach of a contract for the sale of personalty.

(B) Yes, because the storeowner is a merchant with respect to the sale

of a diamond ring.

(C) Yes, because the ring is highly unusual.

(D) Yes, because the storeowner could have obtained specific
performance in the event of a breach by the plaintiff.

159. The plaintiff was a retailer of home-gardening supplies. On March 1,
the plaintiff entered into a written contract with a wholesaler of seeds.
According to the terms, the wholesaler was to furnish the plaintiff with
pumpkin seeds in 10-pound bags at a specified price. The contract
provided that for a period of one year, the plaintiff would purchase all
its pumpkin seeds from the wholesaler and that the wholesaler would
furnish all the pumpkin seeds required by the plaintiff. It provided

346

further that the plaintiff would advise the wholesaler of its
requirements by the first of each month and that the wholesaler would
make delivery by the end of that month. The contract was silent about
the right to assign or delegate.

Upon signing the contract on March 1, the plaintiff notified the
wholesaler of its pumpkin seed requirements for that month. The
wholesaler made a delivery to the plaintiff on March 17. Prior to
April 1, the plaintiff notified the wholesaler of its pumpkin
requirements for April. On April 20, the wholesaler sold its entire
business to a new owner, including its contract with the plaintiff, and
notified the plaintiff of the sale the same day. On April 24, after the
plaintiff received notice of the assignment, the new owner delivered
the seeds that the plaintiff ordered from the wholesaler.

The next day, the plaintiff wrote to the new owner, enclosing a check
for the seeds that the new owner had delivered, and demanding that the
new owner assure the plaintiff that it would be able to meet the
plaintiff's pumpkin seed requirements in the future. On June 1, not
having heard from the new owner, the plaintiff notified the wholesaler
and the new owner that it was canceling the contract.

If the plaintiff asserts a claim against the wholesaler for breach of
contract, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff.

(B) the wholesaler, because the plaintiff impliedly consented to the

assignment by accepting delivery from the new owner.

(C) the wholesaler, because the plaintiff impliedly consented to the
assignment by demanding assurances from the new owner.

(D) the wholesaler, because its assignment of rights to the new owner

implied a delegation of duties.

160. The homeowner hired a painting contractor to paint the homeowner's

residence, entering into a valid written contract with the contractor that
fixed the price of the job at $5,000 and provided that the contractor
would deliver a “satisfactory result.” After the contractor finished
painting the house, he sent the homeowner a bill for $5,000. When the
homeowner received the bill, he called the contractor and complained
about the paint job, saying that he did not think it was “satisfactory” as

347

required by the contract. The paint job had many noticeable drips and
missed spots. He said, “I've got half a mind not to pay you at all, but if
you'll take $4,500, I'm willing to call it square.” The contractor
reluctantly agreed to accept $4,500, even though he thought the job was
just fine and the homeowner was not entitled to a reduction in price.

The contractor subsequently brought a claim against the homeowner
for $500 as the balance due on the agreed price for the paint job,
asserting that his agreement to accept $4,500 was unsupported by
consideration. If the homeowner defends by claiming that there was an
accord and satisfaction, the court should find for

(A) the homeowner, because the homeowner reasonably believed that 
the result was not “satisfactory” as required by the contract.

(B) the homeowner, because no consideration is required for an

agreement to modify a contract.

(C) the contractor, because the agreement to modify the contract was

not in writing.

(D) the contractor, because the contractor did not believe that the result
was not “satisfactory,” as required by the contract, or that the
homeowner was entitled to a reduction in price.

161. A home design store contracted with a manufacturer to buy 1,000

drinking cups made of glass. In response, the manufacturer sent 1,000
drinking glasses made of plastic. The store received the goods, paid
for them, but failed to discover the cups were plastic instead of glass.
A few days later, the store discovered the discrepancy. In the home
wares and design industry, a plastic cup is generally worth half as
much as a glass cup. At the time the cups were delivered, the cost of a
plastic cup was 50 cents, and the cost of a glass cup was $1. However,
due to a huge drop in the stock market, the market price for all
housewares dropped 50 percent. By the time the store could sell the
cups to a discount store, the price for plastic cups was 25 cents.

The home design store sued the manufacturer for damages. The court
should find for

(A) The home design store, for $500.

(B) The home design store, for $750.

(C) The home design store, for $1,000.

348

(D) The manufacturer.

162. A manufacturer needed a new factory and purchased a parcel of realty
on which he wished to have it constructed. After negotiation, the
manufacturer entered into a valid written contract with a licensed
builder. Pursuant to its terms, the builder was to construct a two-story
building on the manufacturer's realty according to specifications
furnished by the manufacturer, at a total price of $250,000, to be paid
in full upon completion of the building.

When the structure was partially completed, the manufacturer decided
to retire from the business and told the builder to stop work. The
builder had already spent $180,000 on materials and labor and would
have needed to spend another $35,000 to complete the building in
conformity with the specifications. Because of an increase in
construction costs, the value of the partially completed structure was
$300,000. If the builder asserts a claim against the manufacturer for
breach of contract, the builder should recover

(A) $265,000 (the value of the partially completed structure less the

cost of completing construction).

(B) $250,000 (the contract price).

(C) $215,000 (the contract price less the cost of completing

construction).

(D) $180,000 (the amount that the builder has expended).

163. The seller wanted to sell his accordion. Because four buyers had all

expressed interest in it, the seller wrote to all of them on May 1, telling
them he was selling his accordion, had told all four of them he was
doing so, and would sell it for a fair price.

On June 16, the seller received a letter from the first buyer offering to
buy the accordion for $1,000. On June 19, the seller received a letter
from the second buyer that said, “I received your offer of May 1. Will
$2,000 buy the accordion?”

On June 21, the seller wrote to the second buyer, “I accept your offer
and will sell you the accordion for $2,000. (signed).”

The seller's letter of June 21 is best described as

349

(A) an offer.

(B) an acceptance.

(C) an invitation to negotiate.

(D) an anticipatory repudiation of the seller's agreement with the first

buyer.

164. The buyer agreed to purchase steel beams from the seller by a written

contract. The beams were delivered by truck and were in a closed box.
Upon inspection, however, the buyer discovered the beams were iron
instead of steel. The buyer sent the seller a letter notifying him that the
beams did not conform to the contract. Even so, the buyer kept and
used the beams, even though iron beams were not as valuable as steel
ones. If the buyer asserts a claim against the seller for breach of
warranty, the court should enter judgment in favor of

(A) the buyer, for the difference between the value of steel beams and

iron beams.

(B) the buyer, for the return of the price that he paid.

(C) the seller, because the buyer used the beams.

(D) the seller, because he might have been able to sell the beams

elsewhere for a higher price.

165. On August 1, the homeowner entered into a written contract with a

buyer for the purchase and sale of the homeowner's home at a price of
$398,000, with title to close on December 1. On November 1, the
buyer informed the homeowner that he was severely ill, and that due to
the changes in his financial circumstances, he would not be going
through with the deal.

The homeowner instituted an action against the buyer for breach of
contract. Which of the following statements is most correct regarding
the legal relationship between the homeowner and the buyer?

(A) The homeowner is entitled to a judgment for damages resulting

from the buyer's refusal to complete the transaction.

(B) The homeowner is entitled to a judgment for specific performance

because every parcel of real estate is unique.

(C) The homeowner is entitled to a judgment for damages resulting

from the buyer's refusal to complete the transaction, and he is also

350

entitled to specific performance, because every parcel of real
estate is unique.

(D) The buyer is excused from performance because of impossibility.

166. Because he always wanted his nephew to live nearby, the landowner
offered to leave his nephew half of his estate if he agreed to move
back to the city. The nephew agreed. The nephew then asked his sister
if she would let him live in her apartment until the landowner died in
exchange for half of what he received from the landowner. The
landowner soon passed away.

The landowner's will left his entire estate to the nephew. The nephew
refused to share any portion of it with his sister. If there was an
enforceable agreement between the nephew and the landowner, his
sister is most correctly described as an

(A) intended creditor beneficiary of that agreement.

(B) intended donee beneficiary of that agreement.

(C) incidental beneficiary of that agreement.

(D) assignee of 50 percent of whatever rights the nephew has under that

agreement.

167. In exchange for use of his neighbor's boat, the homeowner hired a lawn

service to maintain his lawn and his neighbor's lawn for the next two
years. The homeowner and the lawn service signed a memorandum of
agreement, and the homeowner gave a photocopy of it to his neighbor.
The lawn service rendered services as agreed for six months. Then,
the lawn service notified the homeowner and the neighbor that it would
no longer be able to work on their lawns. The neighbor sued the lawn
service for breaching the agreement contained in the memorandum. The
court should find for

(A) the neighbor, because he is a creditor third-party beneficiary of the

contract between the lawn service and the homeowner.

(B) the neighbor, because the neighbor is a donee third-party

beneficiary of the contract between the lawn service and the
homeowner.

(C) the lawn service, because the neighbor is only an incidental third-
party beneficiary of the contract between the lawn service and the
homeowner.

351

(D) the lawn service, because there was no privity between the lawn

service and the neighbor.

168. On July 1, after hearing that the buyer was going to attend law school,
the seller sent the buyer a letter offering to sell his old law books. The
buyer wrote back on July 8 and told the seller he would buy the law
books for $100 if the seller delivered them to his apartment on
September 1. On August 1, the buyer decided that he did not want to go
to law school after all and wrote the seller a note telling him that he
was no longer interested in buying the law books. He was about to go
to the post office to mail it when the seller knocked at his door. As
soon as the buyer opened the door, the seller said, “I'll bring you those
law books tomorrow. I'll just have to borrow a friend's station wagon
to transport them.” The buyer said, “Never mind. I don't want them,”
and handed the seller the note that he had written but not mailed.

The seller's statement on August 1 that “I'll be bringing you those law
books tomorrow” was probably

(A) an offer.

(B) a ratification of the acceptance that was mailed on July 8 but was

never delivered to the buyer.

(C) an acceptance.

(D) commencement of performance.

169. A homeowner asked a builder to build a new pool in his backyard
while he was away on a three-week bus tour of Europe. The
homeowner and the builder signed a contract for 10 percent less than
the market price, and the homeowner signed a detailed work order for
the builder's work crew. Several days later, the work crew went out to
do the job described in the work order. By mistake, they installed the
pool in a neighbor's yard. Since the neighbor was on the same trip as
the homeowner, no one was around to tell the work crew they had the
wrong house. When the homeowner returned, he demanded the builder
perform the work as agreed. The builder refused, and the homeowner
sued.

Which of the following additional facts or inferences, if it was the
only one true, would most likely result in a judgment for the builder?

(A) There is another builder who will build a pool for the homeowner

352

for the same price.

(B) The original contract would have resulted in a loss for the builder.

(C) The homeowner had accidentally written the wrong address in the

work order.

(D) The builder was unsuccessful in collecting payment from the

neighbor.

170. After a fire destroyed a storeowner's store, the storeowner entered into

a contract with a builder to rebuild the store for $200,000. The
contract called for work to be completed by December 1. After taking
a closer look at the work that needed to be done, the builder contacted
the storeowner and said he could not take on the job for less than
$275,000.

The storeowner quickly found another builder who was willing to do
the job for $250,000. After the second builder began work, the
storeowner contacted him and said that if he could finish the building
by November 1, the storeowner would pay him an extra $25,000. The
second builder completed the work by November 1, and the
storeowner paid him $275,000. The storeowner then sued the first
builder for damages resulting from breach of the original construction
contract. A court would likely award the storeowner

(A) nothing.

(B) $25,000.

(C) $50,000.

(D) $75,000.

171. An entrepreneur entered into a contract with a seller to buy a new

office building for his new company. Prior to the date set for closing,
the entrepreneur contacted the seller and said he was no longer buying
the building because the necessary funding for the company had not
come through. The seller did not try to resell the office building. A
year later, the seller sued the entrepreneur for breach of contract.

In deciding the lawsuit, the court should rule in favor of

(A) the entrepreneur, because the seller did not try to resell the office

building.

353

(B) the entrepreneur, under the doctrine of impossibility of

performance.

(C) the entrepreneur, because he notified the seller prior to the date set

for closing.

(D) the seller, for a sum equal to the difference between the contract
price and the fair market value of the property on the date set for
closing.

172. On June 2, a truck manufacturer and an engine maker entered into an
agreement for the sale of a new engine for $1,000. In a telephone
conversation with the engine maker on June 5, however, the truck
manufacturer said that he would sue the engine maker for breach of
contract unless the engine maker agreed to accept $200 as payment in
full. Because business was poor, the engine maker agreed to accept
that sum, but then she subsequently rejected the truck manufacturer's
tender of $200. If the engine maker sues the truck manufacturer for
$1,000, the court should find for

(A) the truck manufacturer, because the original agreement was

modified in the telephone conversation of June 5.

(B) the engine maker, because her agreement to accept $200 was not

evidenced by a writing.

(C) the engine maker, because her agreement to accept $200 was

unsupported by consideration.

(D) the engine maker, because her agreement to accept $200 was made

under duress.

173. Important as a food commodity, pears are traded on the American Pear
Exchange. Although farmers are free to negotiate prices for the sale of
their pears, the price received by pear farmers on any given day is
generally determined by the American Pear Exchange price.

In January, a farmer planted an orchard of pears that would be ready
for harvest in June. Because she expected the harvest to yield more
than 5,000 bushels of pears, she entered into a written contract with a
buyer on March 1, wherein the farmer agreed to sell and the buyer
agreed to buy 2,000 bushels of pears to be delivered during the month
of June at the American Pear Exchange price as of June 15. On March
2, the farmer entered into an identical written contract with a
restaurant.

354

In the first week of April, heavy rains inundated the farmer's orchard,
destroying part of her crop. As a result, she doubted that she would be
able to fulfill her contract. The farmer than called the buyer. When she
explained the problem to the buyer, he said that he would accept 1,000
bushels instead of 2,000 if the farmer would agree to accept the
American Pear Exchange price as of May 1 instead of June 15. The
farmer said, “Well, you've got me over a barrel. I'll never be able to
deliver 2,000 bushels in June, so I accept your terms.”

On May 1, the price was $2 per bushel. On June 16, the price of pears
doubled. The farmer's harvest yielded 4,000 bushels. The farmer
delivered 1,000 bushels to the buyer on June 20. The buyer demanded
the right to purchase another 1,000 bushels at $2 per bushel, but the
farmer refused to sell him an additional 1,000 bushels at that price. If
the buyer institutes a claim against the farmer for breach of contract,
the court should find for

(A) the farmer, because farmers are free to negotiate prices for the sale

of their pears.

(B) the farmer, because her agreement to accept the American Pear
Exchange price as of May 1 was consideration for the buyer's
agreement to accept 1,000 bushels instead of 2,000 bushels.

(C) the buyer, because the agreement to modify his contract with the

farmer was not in writing.

(D) the buyer, because the farmer's harvest was sufficient to permit her

to satisfy her original contractual obligations.

174. In August 2012, a bar owner threatened to sue the student for $10,000,

claiming that the student owed him that sum for unpaid bar bills. The
student asked his mother to lend him money with which to pay the bar
owner. On September 1, 2012, the student's mother stated orally that if
the student promised to go to law school and to stop drinking for the
rest of his life, she would give him $10,000 on July 1, 2013. The
student promised that he would never drink alcohol again, and that he
would enroll in law school as soon as possible. On September 3,
2012, the student wrote to the bar owner, describing his agreement
with his mother and stating that if the bar owner did not sue him, he
would pay the bar owner the $10,000 as soon as he received it from
his mother.

355

The student began attending a law school two weeks later. In
December 2012, however, he withdrew from the school, deciding that
he did not like it.

On July 1, the student's mother paid her son $10,000, but the student
refused to pay the bar owner, denying that he owed unpaid bar bills. If
the bar owner asserts a claim against the student for breach of the
promise contained in the student's letter of September 3, which of the
following additional facts, if it were the only one true, would be most
likely to result in a judgment for the bar owner?

(A) The bar owner did not respond to the student's letter of September

3.

(B) On September 3, the student reasonably believed that he owed the
bar owner $10,000, but the bar owner did not reasonably believe
that the student owed him $10,000.

(C) On September 3, the bar owner reasonably believed that the student

owed him $10,000, but the student did not reasonably believe that
he owed the bar owner $10,000.

(D) On July 1, the bar owner's claim against the student for unpaid bar

bills was barred by the statute of limitations.

175. The homeowner hired a famous landscaper to fix up his lawn. The
landscaper's design owner's house and planted with aquatic plants.
Although the landscaper completed the rest of the job himself, he hired
an earthmoving subcontractor to dig the moat, which the earthmoving
subcontractor did in complete conformity with the landscaper's plan.
The entire job was completed in a reasonably workmanlike manner,
but the homeowner refused to make any payment under the contract.

The landscaper asserted a claim against the homeowner on account of
the homeowner's refusal to pay him for his services, and the
homeowner defended on the ground that the landscaper breached the
contract by hiring a subcontractor to dig the moat. In deciding the
claim, the court should find for

(A) the homeowner, because the landscaper hired the earthmoving
subcontractor to dig the moat around the homeowner's house.

(B) the homeowner, because the reason that the homeowner contracted
with the landscaper was that he wanted the job done by a well-

356

known landscape architect.

(C) the landscaper, because the moat was dug in complete conformity

with the landscaper's plan.

(D) the landscaper, because all contract rights are freely assignable.

176. In exchange for use of his neighbor's ski house, the homeowner hired a
lawn service to maintain his lawn and his neighbor's lawn for the next
two years, agreeing to pay the lawn service $50 per month for certain
specified services. The homeowner and the lawn service signed a
memorandum of agreement, and the homeowner gave a photocopy of it
to his neighbor. Two months later, the homeowner sold his house to a
doctor. At the closing of title, the homeowner handed the doctor the
original memorandum of his agreement with the lawn service and
executed an assignment to the doctor of his rights thereunder. The lawn
service continued rendering services as agreed for an additional six
months, receiving a check for $50 from the doctor each month. Then,
the lawn service notified the neighbor and the doctor that it would no
longer be able to work on their lawns.

The neighbor hired a gardener to continue performing the same
services on the neighbor's lawn for a fee of $25 per month. If the
neighbor sues the doctor for $400 ($25 per month for the 16 months
remaining in the term), the court should find for

(A) the neighbor, because the doctor's monthly payments to the lawn
service resulted in an estoppel-type waiver of his rights to deny
liability.

(B) the neighbor, because the homeowner's promise to provide lawn

maintenance services touches and concerns the land.

(C) the doctor, because he did not agree to pay for the maintenance of

the neighbor's lawn.

(D) the doctor, because the price of $25 per month to maintain the
neighbor's lawn was equal to one-half the price that the lawn
service charged for maintaining both lawns.

177. On April 1, a law firm hired a famous and uniquely skilled software

specialist to design and install new computer software specifically for
the firm. The new software was to be installed by October 1. On
August 15, after winning the state lottery, the specialist sold her
business to a computer dealer. The computer dealer agreed to fulfill

357

any existing contracts entered into by the specialist.

On August 16, the specialist informed the firm of her sale to the dealer,
stating that the software called for by the contract would be designed
and installed by the dealer and not the specialist. If the firm institutes a
claim against the specialist on August 18, the court should find for

(A) the firm, since the specialist's statement on August 16 was an

anticipatory repudiation.

(B) the firm, since the specialist's sale to the dealer did not impose on

the dealer an obligation to design software.

(C) the specialist, since design and installation of the software was not

required until October 1.

(D) the specialist, since her sale to the dealer implied a delegation of

all her obligations under her contract with the firm.

178. On May 15, a music store telephoned a guitar factory and ordered 50

guitars at a price of $200 per guitar. On May 16, the music store sent a
signed letter marked “Confirmation” that read: “This confirms our
order of 5 guitars.” On May 17, the factory shipped 50 guitars to the
store. On May 18, the factory received the letter from the music store.
On May 19, the factory sent a bill to the store for $10,000. On May 20,
the music store received the bill. On May 21, the music store sent back
the 50 guitars with a letter marked “Failure to Order” that read: “We
never ordered these.” On May 22, the factory received the letter. The
factory can make all of the guitars it has customer orders for, and it
makes a profit of $50 per guitar.

May the factory recover on the contract against the music store?

(A) Yes, for $10,000.

(B) Yes, for $2,500.

(C) Yes, for $250.

(D) No.

179. A local school held a charity auction where companies and other

members of the community donated items for the school to auction off.
A local guitar maker agreed to donate a new electric guitar valued at
over $1,500. During the auction, the plaintiff bid $50 and was
declared the highest bidder. The plaintiff gave the school a check for

358

$50. Because the guitar company was so embarrassed at the low price
paid for the guitar, it refused to deliver it to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff
asserts a claim against the guitar company for failing to deliver the
guitar, the court should find for

(A) the plaintiff, as an assignee.

(B) the plaintiff, as an intended third-party creditor beneficiary.

(C) the guitar company, because there was no agreement between it and

the plaintiff.

(D) the guitar company, because the agreement was not supported by

consideration.

180. A famous musician was scheduled to play a concert that would be

broadcast on national television. A music-streaming service that had
an exclusive agreement with the musician contracted with the
television network to run a 30-second advertisement on Saturday,
October 1, at 8:15 P.M. Although the contract did not state it
specifically, the understanding was that the advertisement would run
during the last 15 minutes of the concert. The advertisement was
designed to promote the music-streaming service by advertising the
musician's “surprise” new album that was exclusive to the site.

The day before the concert, the musician was killed in a car accident.
The television station offered to run the advertisement at the agreed
time for a 20 percent discount, but the music service declined, stating
that the entire advertisement and advertising campaign was built
around the concert occurring. If the television station sues the music-
streaming service for breach of contract, how should the court rule?

(A) For the television station, because the contract did not specifically

state the advertisement would run during the concert.

(B) For the television station, since there was nothing stopping it from

running the advertisement at the agreed time.

(C) For the music-streaming service, under the doctrine of

impossibility.

(D) For the music-streaming service, under the doctrine of frustration of

purpose.

ANSWERS TO 
CONTRACTS QUESTIONS

1.  D  The  plaintiff's  father's  offer  was  for  a  unilateral  contract  —  his
promise  to  pay  in  return  for  the  plaintiff's  postponing  the  wedding.
When  the  plaintiff  postponed  the  wedding,  he  accepted  his  father's
offer, and a contract was formed.

Some  cases  have  held  that  an  agreement  never  to  marry  violates
public policy, but there is no reason why an agreement to postpone a
marriage  would  do  so.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect
because  the  plaintiff's  father's  promise  was  to  pay  if  the  plaintiff
postponed  the  wedding.  His  language  did  not  make  payment
conditional  upon  the  plaintiff's  registration  for  a  second  year.
Although  an  offer  terminates  upon  the  death  of  the  offeror,  C  is
incorrect  because  the  plaintiff  accepted  the  offer  by  postponing  the
wedding, and, once accepted, an offer is no longer revocable.

2. D Since the dealer sold the chairs to another buyer at the same price that
the  decorator  had  contracted  to  pay,  the  dealer  sustained  no  damage.
Where there is no limit to the availability of the items sold, some cases
allow a seller to recover lost profits when a buyer cancels, reasoning
that  even  though  the  seller  resold  at  the  same  price,  he  or  she  would
have  made  two  sales  instead  of  one  if  the  buyer  had  not  breached.
Since  there  were  no  more  chairs  to  sell,  however,  the  dealer  lost
nothing.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  An  action  for  the  price  might  be  available
where traditional calculation of damages would be inadequate, but B
is incorrect because the dealer has suffered no damages. C correctly
states the remedy that would have been available to the decorator in
the  event  of  a  breach  by  the  dealer.  Because  the  fair  market  value
exceeds  the  contract  price,  however,  the  formula  expressed  in  C
bears no relationship to damages suffered by the dealer as a result of
the decorator's breach. C is therefore incorrect.

3. A If an event that was not foreseeable to the parties at the time a contract
was  formed  makes  performance  of  the  contract  impossible,  such
performance  is  excused.  In  the  absence  of  facts  that  specifically
suggest  the  contrary,  destruction  of  the  subject  matter  of  a  contract  is
usually  held  to  have  been  unforeseeable  by  the  parties  at  the  time  of

361

contracting.

At the time the fire occurred, the plaintiff was not in breach because
he  was  not  required  to  make  payment  until  the  garage  was  half
complete,  and  the  defendant  was  not  in  breach  because  he  was  not
required  to  be  half  finished  until  April  25.  B  and  C  are  therefore
incorrect.  It  is  usually  held  that  impossibility  excuses  performance
only  to  the  extent  that  performance  has  been  made  impossible.  D  is
incorrect, however, because the contract was not for labor until June
1, but rather for construction of the garage by June 1, and the fire has
made completion by that date impossible.

4. A The UCC provides that where there is no agreement to the contrary, a
buyer is entitled to inspect goods prior to making payment or accepting
them.  It  provides  further,  however,  that  the  parties  may  agree  that
payment is required before inspection. If so, failure to make payment
upon delivery of the goods is a breach.

Anticipatory  repudiation  occurs  when,  prior  to  the  time  when
performance is required, a party indicates by word or deed that he or
she will not perform. B is incorrect because the buyer's refusal to pay
occurred at the time payment was required, and therefore constituted
a  breach.  The  UCC  provides  that  even  if  payment  is  made  prior  to
inspection,  no  acceptance  occurs  until  after  the  buyer  has  had  a
reasonable  opportunity  to  inspect.  In  view  of  this  provision,  a
promise  to  pay  prior  to  inspection  is  not  unconscionable,  and  C  is
incorrect.  Since  the  seller  tendered  delivery  in  accordance  with  the
terms of the contract, D is incorrect.

5.  A  A  unilateral  contract  is  a  promise  to  perform  in  exchange  for  a
specified  act  by  the  promisee.  Since  the  company  promised  to  make
payment  to  the  employee  who  submitted  the  winning  design,  its  offer
was for a unilateral contract.

A bilateral contract is an exchange of promises, each given in return
for  the  other.  Since  the  company  promised  to  pay  only  if  the
modification design was actually submitted, and asked for no promise
in return for its promise to pay, B is incorrect. The company's notice
made clear its intention to pay only one prize and its obligation to pay
only upon receipt of a design that complied with its requirements. Its
promise,  therefore,  could  not  have  been  given  in  exchange  for  the
promise contained in the engineer's March 8 memo, even if that memo

362

had  been  received.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  key  difference
between an offer and an invitation to negotiate is that an offer creates
an immediate power of acceptance in the offeree. Since any employee
could have accepted the company's offer of a reward by successfully
designing  and  submitting  the  required  program  modification,  D  is
incorrect.

6. B If a promise not to assign a contract is enforceable, it is like any other
promise, in that damages may be available as a remedy for its breach.
An assignment made in violation of such a promise is usually regarded
as  valid,  however.  This  means  that  even  though  the  gardener  may  be
entitled  to  recover  from  the  owner  for  damages  resulting  from  the
owner's  assignment  to  the  plaintiff,  the  plaintiff  may  enforce  the
contract against the gardener.

C  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  is  incorrect  because  a  promise  not  to
assign  without  a  party's  consent  does  not  require  that  party  to  act
reasonably  in  deciding  whether  or  not  to  consent.  It  is  generally
understood  that  a  contract  involving  personal  services  is  not
assignable because an assignment of such a contract may increase the
obligor's  burden.  Since  the  contract  between  the  owner  and  the
gardener  specified  the  tasks  that  the  gardener  was  to  perform,  and
since a change in obligee (i.e., in the ownership of the condominium)
would  not  alter  those  tasks,  assignment  to  the  plaintiff  did  not
increase  the  gardener's  burden.  For  this  reason,  the  contract  should
not  be  regarded  as  one  calling  for  personal  services,  and  D  is
incorrect.

7.  C  Consideration  is  a  benefit  to  the  promisor  or  a  detriment  to  the
promisee that was bargained for and given in return for the promisor's
promise.  For  this  reason,  if  the  police  officer  did  something  that  he
was already obligated to do, his act could not be consideration for the
city's promise to pay since no new benefit was given to the city and no
detriment was sustained by the police officer in return for that promise.
A  police  officer's  obligation  to  his  employer  includes  the  duty  to
attempt  to  apprehend  criminals,  so  the  police  officer's  performance
was of a preexisting duty.

A is incorrect because establishing that the informant is entitled to the
reward  does  not  necessarily  establish  that  the  police  officer  (or
anybody  else)  is  not  entitled  to  it  as  well.  B  is  incorrect  because  a
guilty  plea  is  a  conviction.  Since  the  city's  promise  was  to  pay  in

363

return for information leading to a conviction, it was an offer to pay
for something of value, not an offer for a gratuitous cash award. D is
therefore incorrect.

8. D The parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence
of  prior  or  contemporaneous  agreements  offered  to  contradict,  vary,
or modify an unambiguous writing that the parties intended to be a full
and  final  expression  of 
their  agreement  (i.e.,  a  “complete
integration”).  Since  the  “dollar”  is  the  unit  of  currency  in  both  the
United  States  and  the  foreign  country,  the  contract  that  specifies  a
price of 9,000 dollars without identifying which country's dollars are
intended is probably ambiguous. The evidence offered by the plaintiff
would help explain and clarify the ambiguity. It is not barred by the
parol evidence rule since it does not contradict, vary, or modify the
writing.

A  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  Ambiguities  in  a  writing  are
frequently  construed  against  the  party  who  prepared  it,  but  only  if
they  cannot  be  clarified  in  some  other  way.  B  is  incorrect  because
parol evidence may be introduced to explain an ambiguity, no matter
who caused it.

9. D  The  man  made  no  express  promise  to  pay  for  the  fishing  gear.  There
was  no  implied  promise  because  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  the
plaintiff acted with the expectation of compensation or reimbursement
for her losses. The executor is therefore not bound to pay for her loss.

Quantum meruit is available to prevent unjust enrichment only where
services were rendered under circumstances such that the party from
whom payment is sought was aware of the other party's expectation of
payment. A is therefore incorrect. The phrase “danger invites rescue”
has  been  used  in  tort  cases  to  explain  why  one  who  creates  a  peril
owes a duty of care to a person attempting to rescue another from it.
B is incorrect, however, because the principle has no application in
contract problems. Since there is no indication that the man promised
to pay for the fishing gear, the fact that someone else in his position
would have is irrelevant, making C incorrect.

10.  A  Performance  of  one  of  a  series  of  mutual  promises  is  a  condition
precedent  to  others  in  the  series  if  the  circumstances  indicate  that  it
should  obviously  precede  the  others.  Since  the  writing  called  for
payment  of  $300  in  advance,  it  is  obvious  that  the  parties  intended

364

that  it  should  be  paid  before  the  work  commenced.  The  woman's
payment  of  $300  was  thus  a  condition  precedent  to  the  body  shop's
obligation  to  paint.  Since  the  contract  called  for  the  payment  of  an
additional  $400  after  completion,  it  is  obvious  that  the  parties
intended  that  the  paint  job  should  be  finished  before  payment  of  the
additional money was required. Completion of the paint job is thus a
condition  precedent  to  the  woman's  obligation  to  pay  the  additional
$400.

A condition subsequent is an event the occurrence or non-occurrence
of  which  operates  to  discharge  a  duty  that  had  already  become
absolute. Since the body shop was obligated to paint before receiving
the additional $400, and since it could not undo the paint job once it
was  completed,  the  woman's  payment  of  the  additional  $400  cannot
be  called  a  condition  subsequent  to  the  body  shop's  obligation  to
paint the car. B is therefore incorrect. Concurrent conditions require
the  parties  to  exchange  performance  simultaneously.  C  is  incorrect
because the language of the contract makes it obvious that the parties
intended  a  consecutive  order  of  performance  (i.e.,  the  woman  pays
$300,  the  body  shop  completes  paint  job,  the  woman  pays  $400).
Since  the  agreement  required  partial  payment  in  advance  and
completion of the job before the balance was due, D is incorrect.

11. C  In  an  action  for  breach  of  an  employment  contract,  a  non-breaching
employee is entitled to receive the full contract price for the balance
of  the  term  plus  consequential  damages,  less  damages  avoided  by
mitigation. Since the plaintiff mitigated damages by taking a job with
another  company  at  the  same  salary,  he  is  entitled  to  what  he  lost
between  the  discharge  and  the  beginning  of  his  new  job.  His
advertising expenses are collectible as consequential damages.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  reorganization  by  the  defendant  was
voluntary. An employment contract may require payment of severance
pay in the event of termination, but absent such agreement, there is no
such  legal  requirement.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect
because the plaintiff's work for the new company at the same salary
mitigated his damages.

12. A If the defendant's statement implied a promise to paint the cars, it was
an acceptance of the plaintiff's offer, thus forming a contract of which
the defendant's subsequent refusal to paint the cars would be a breach.
(Note:  Although  the  defendant's  statement  probably  was  not  a

365

promise,  the  question  requires  this  to  be  assumed  as  an  additional
fact.)

If, on the other hand, he made no promise to paint the cars, there was
no contract and could be no breach. This would be true even though
the  plaintiff  suffered  detriment  in  reliance  on  his  belief  that  the
defendant  would  paint  his  cars.  B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.
When  the  plaintiff  offered  $125  per  car,  he  rejected  the  defendant's
offer  to  paint  them  for  $150.  It  was  too  late  for  him  to  accept  that
offer on January 3, so D is incorrect.

13. D None of the reasons given to justify a victory for the defendant is a
good  one.  The  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose  may  excuse
performance  of  a  contract  when  an  unforeseen  event  destroys  its
underlying  purpose,  but  only  if  both  parties  knew  what  that  purpose
was.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  plaintiff  did  not  know  the  defendant's
purpose.  Impossibility  of  performance  discharges  a  contractual
obligation  when  an  unforeseen  event  makes  performance  vitally
different  from  that  reasonably  contemplated  by  both  parties  at  the
time the contract was formed. B is incorrect because the plaintiff was
unaware of the use contemplated by the defendant. When government
action  makes  the  subject  matter  of  a  contract  unlawful,  it  may  be
unenforceable  for  illegality,  because  of  frustration  of  purpose,  or
under  the  doctrine  of  impossibility  of  performance.  C  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  subject  matter  of  the  contract  between  the
defendant and the plaintiff was the rental of a motion picture theater,
and the showing of motion pictures was not made unlawful by the city
council's action.

14. D The Statute of Frauds requires a contract for the sale of goods with a
price  of  $500  or  more  to  be  in  writing,  but  it  does  not  apply  to  a
contract for services, even if goods are to be provided by the person
performing the services.

15.  B  Usually,  a  promise  is  unenforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration  is  a  bargained-for  exchange  of  value
given  for  a  promise  and  may  consist  of  benefit  to  the  promisor  or
detriment to the promisee. If an alleged debt is invalid, a person who
promises to pay a sum in settlement of it receives no benefit in return
for  his  or  her  promise.  Similarly,  if  a  person  who  receives  such  a

366

promise  does  not  honestly  believe  that  the  debt  is  valid,  he  or  she
suffers no detriment by agreeing to accept less in settlement. For this
reason, a promise to pay a sum of money to settle a claim for debt is
supported by consideration if the debt is valid or the person asserting
the  claim  believes  that  it  is.  Thus,  if  the  plaintiff  honestly  believed
that the defendant owed him $3,000, his agreement to accept $2,000
was  consideration  for  the  defendant's  promise,  making  the  promise
enforceable.

On  the  other  hand,  if  the  plaintiff  did  not  believe  that  the  defendant
owed  him  the  money,  the  plaintiff  suffered  no  detriment  and  the
defendant  received  no  benefit  in  return  for  the  defendant's  promise.
Since  the  promise  would,  thus,  be  unsupported  by  consideration,  it
would  be  unenforceable.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  and  D  are
incorrect  because  unless  the  debt  actually  existed  or  the  plaintiff
believed  that  it  did,  his  agreement  to  accept  $2,000  would  not  be
consideration for the defendant's promise to pay it.

16. A Although the parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic
evidence  for  the  purpose  of  modifying  the  terms  of  certain  written
memorandums, it does not prevent the admission of such testimony for
the  purpose  of  establishing  that  no  contract  was  ever  formed.  Since
the oral agreement made before execution of the writing establishes a
condition precedent to the formation of a contract, it is admissible.

An agreement to modify a contract is one that is made after formation
of the contract. B  is  incorrect  because  the  oral  agreement  regarding
the loan was made before execution of the written contract. Since the
defendant has not asserted that the written agreement is valid, there is
no  reason  why  he  should  be  estopped  from  denying  that  it  is.  C  is
therefore incorrect. D is incorrect because the oral agreement relates
to the formation of the contract and does not modify or contradict its
terms.

17. A The Statute of Frauds requires a contract for the sale of goods with a
price  of  $500  or  more  to  be  in  writing.  It  might  be  argued  that  the
agreement in A was divisible — really 15 separate agreements, each
for a single $100 purchase — and therefore not within the Statute of
Frauds. (Note: Since the agreement was for the purchase of a “series”
of figurines, it was probably not a divisible contract, but A is the only
one of the four fact patterns presented in which the Statute of Frauds
might prevent enforcement.)

367

UCC  §2-201  specifically  excludes  from  application  of  the  statute  a
contract for the sale of specifically manufactured goods if the seller
has made a substantial beginning in their manufacture. The Statute of
Frauds  would  be  inapplicable  in  B  since  the  plaintiff  had  already
completed the rough carving when the defendant attempted to cancel
the contract. Since UCC §2-201 specifies that the Statute of Frauds is
satisfied  by  an  admission  in  the  pleadings  of  the  existence  of  a
contract, the statute would not prevent enforcement in C. UCC §2-201
provides  that  between  merchants,  a  written  memorandum  of  a
contract that is sufficient to bind the sender binds the receiver also if
he or she fails to object to it within 10 days. Since both parties in D
are merchants, the writing prepared by the plaintiff and not responded
to by the defendant satisfies the statute.

18.  B  A  minor  may  disaffirm  a  contract  on  the  ground  of  incapacity.  If,
however,  the  disaffirming  minor  is  the  plaintiff  in  an  action  for
restitution, his or her recovery will be offset by the reasonable value
of  the  benefit  that  he  or  she  had  received.  Measuring  the  benefit  in
terms of reasonable rental value is a common judicial approach.

A is therefore incorrect. C  is  incorrect  because  the  damage  that  the
car sustained is not related to the benefit that the plaintiff received. D
is incorrect because it fails to recognize the minor's right to disaffirm
the contract.

19. C  An  offer  may  be  revoked  at  any  time  prior  to  its  acceptance  and  is
effectively  revoked  when  the  offeree  learns  of  an  act  by  the  offeror
that is wholly inconsistent with the offer. The seller's offer to sell the
tractor to the buyer was thus revoked when the buyer learned that the
seller had sold it to the other neighbor.

The  seller's  promise  to  keep  the  offer  open  until  March  15  was
unsupported  by  consideration  and  therefore  was  not  enforceable.
Although  UCC  §2-205  makes  certain  firm  offers  between  merchants
enforceable without consideration, A is incorrect because the seller
and the buyer were not merchants regarding the sale of the tractor. B
is  incorrect  because  the  revocation  took  effect  when  the  buyer
learned of the sale to the other neighbor. D is incorrect because the
letter of February 15 was an offer to sell the tractor and could have
given  rise  to  a  contract  if  accepted  by  the  buyer  before  the  seller
revoked it.

368

20. A A court may reform a contract to reflect the intentions of the parties if,
as  a  result  of  inadvertence,  the  writing  does  not  actually  reflect  the
intentions.  In  determining  the  intentions  of  the  parties,  the  court  may
admit whatever evidence is relevant and material.

B  is  incorrect  because  UCC  §2-201  declares  that  a  writing  may
satisfy  the  Statute  of  Frauds  even  though  one  or  more  terms  (except
the  quantity  term)  are  omitted.  The  Universal  Commercial  Code
(UCC)  provides  that  parties  may  conclude  a  contract  for  sale  even
though the price is not settled, and that if they do, the price is to be the
reasonable  price  at  the  time  of  delivery.  C  is  incorrect,  however,
because the seller and the buyer did agree on a price. D is incorrect
because  parol  evidence  may  be  admitted  for  the  purpose  of
determining what the parties intended the price to be.

21.  C  The  parol  evidence  rule  prohibits  the  introduction  of  extrinsic
evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements to contradict, vary,
or modify an unambiguous writing that the parties intended to be a full
and final expression of their agreement. It is generally understood that
in the absence of fraud or mistake, a clause in a written contract that
states that the writing is intended to be a complete integration of the
agreement  between  the  parties  establishes  that  it  is  a  complete
integration.  If  so,  the  agreement  in  C  would  be  barred  by  the  parol
evidence  rule  since  it  was  a  contemporaneous  agreement  that
contradicts a term of the writing.

The purpose of the parol evidence rule is to discourage litigation by
encouraging parties to put their entire agreement in writing. Since this
purpose would not be served by prohibiting parol evidence regarding
the question of whether or not the obligations created by the writing
ever  came  into  being,  parol  evidence  pertaining  to  a  written
contract's becoming effective is admissible. A is therefore incorrect.
Since  the  writing  requires  the  homeowner  to  pay  for  the  paint,  the
agreements in B and D  do  not  modify  any  obligation  created  by  the
writing  and  so  would  probably  be  admitted.  B  and  D  are  therefore
incorrect.

22. A An agreement for the sale of goods FOB a particular place requires
the seller to load the goods on board a carrier at that place. Once the
seller  has  done  so,  the  buyer's  obligation  to  pay  the  seller  for  the
goods  becomes  complete.  Under  UCC  §2-210,  a  seller  who  has
completely  performed  may  assign  its  rights  even  if  terms  of  the

369

contract  prohibit  assignment.  Since  the  seller's  rights  have  been
assigned  to  the  plaintiff,  the  plaintiff  now  is  entitled  to  collect  the
price from the defendant.

B  correctly  states  the  remedy  usually  available  to  the  buyer  in  the
event of the seller's failure to deliver, but it is incorrect as a statement
of  the  seller's  remedy.  Payment  by  the  defendant  might  enrich  the
plaintiff, but since the plaintiff has given value for the assignment of
the  air-conditioning  company's  rights,  the  enrichment  would  not  be
unjust.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  So  long  as  assignment  does  not
impose an additional burden on the obligor, an assignment of contract
rights is enforceable in spite of a clause prohibiting it. D is therefore
incorrect.

23.  A  A  contract  is  formed  upon  acceptance  of  an  offer.  An  offer  is  a
manifestation of present intent to be bound to specific terms. Since the
niece's  letter  of  August  1  clearly  expressed  her  willingness  to  sell
each  of  the  paintings  to  the  dealer  for  $2,000,  it  was  an  offer.  An
acceptance occurs when the offeree communicates to the offeror that
he or she agrees to the terms of the offer. Since the dealer's telegram
clearly expressed her willingness to pay $2,000 for painting Number
30, it was an acceptance. A contract for the sale of painting Number
30 at a price of $2,000 was thus formed. For this reason, the niece's
action  for  breach  of  a  contract  to  purchase  the  painting  for  $3,000
must  fail  unless  there  has  been  an  enforceable  modification  of  the
original contract. Under UCC §2-209(3), a modification of a contract
must be in writing if the contract as modified is within the provisions
of the Statute of Frauds. Since, as modified, the oral contract between
the  niece  and  the  dealer  calls  for  the  sale  of  goods  with  a  price  in
excess  of  $500,  it  violates  the  Statute  of  Frauds  and  will  not  be
enforced over the dealer's objection. A is therefore correct.

Since an increase in the fair market value of the painting would not
satisfy the requirement of a writing, B is incorrect. A promise that is
not  supported  by  consideration  or  one  that  violates  the  Statute  of
Frauds may be enforceable if the promisee justifiably relies on it to
his or her detriment. C is incorrect, however, because reliance alone
is  insufficient  to  have  this  effect  and  because  there  is  no  indication
that  the  niece  changed  her  position  (i.e.,  relied).  Since  the  niece's
offer  of  August  1  called  for  acceptance  by  telegraphed  order,  the
dealer's  telegram  on  August  2  was  an  acceptance  even  though

370

payment had not been made. D is therefore incorrect.

24.  C  Assignment  of  a  contract  transfers  all  the  assignor's  rights  to  the
assignee.  After  the  assignment,  the  assignor  has  no  rights  in  the
contract and cannot sue to enforce it.

A is incorrect because assignment does not discharge the assignor of
his  or  her  obligations  under  the  contract.  There  is  a  presumption,
however,  that  an  assignment  of  rights  under  a  contract  includes  a
delegation  of  duties  as  well.  B  is  therefore  incorrect  because,  as
assignee, the new homeowner is obligated to make payment as agreed
by the original homeowner. Unless there is a clear agreement to the
contrary, a promise not to assign without consent of the other party is
usually viewed as a covenant. An obligee who breaches that covenant
by  assigning  may  be  liable  for  damages  to  the  obligor,  but  the
assignment is valid in spite of the no-assignment clause so long as it
imposes  no  additional  burden  on  the  obligor.  Since  the  contractor's
obligation after the assignment is identical to his obligation before the
assignment  (i.e.,  to  install  aluminum  sliding  on  the  outside  of  the
building),  there  is  no  reason  to  hold  the  assignment  invalid.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

25. B  The  UCC  treats  a  modification  of  a  contract  as  a  new  contract.  For
this reason, if the contract as modified falls within the provisions of
the  Statute  of  Frauds,  the  modification  must  be  in  writing.  UCC  §2-
209(3). Since the modification resulted in an agreement to sell goods
with a price of $500 or more, the Statute of Frauds requires a written
the  contract
memorandum.  The  absence  of  a  writing  makes 
unenforceable over the objection of the retailer.

A  contract  is  unconscionable  if  one  party  is  so  deprived  of  free
choice  that  he  or  she  is  forced  to  make  a  one-sided  bargain  that
favors  the  other  party.  Since  the  free  enterprise  system  sometimes
results in different prices being set by different suppliers of the same
commodity,  the  mere  fact  that  the  merchandise  was  available  at  a
lower price than that requested by the wholesaler is not sufficient to
make the agreement to pay the wholesaler's price unconscionable. A
is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because, under UCC §2-209(1),
an  agreement  to  modify  a  contract  may  be  enforceable  even  if  it  is
unsupported by consideration. D would be relevant if the wholesaler
attempted 
to  excuse  his  own  nonperformance  by  asserting
impossibility  or  frustration  of  purpose.  Since  the  retailer  agreed  to

371

the modification, however, the wholesaler's reason for requesting it is
irrelevant to its enforceability.

26. C  A  contract  is  formed  upon  acceptance  of  an  offer.  Since  the  buyer's
order identified the subject of the transaction, specified the quantity,
set forth price and terms, and called for shipment, it conferred upon
the  seller  the  power  to  create  a  contract  by  accepting  and  was,
therefore,  an  offer.  Under  UCC  §2-206(1)(b),  an  order  to  purchase
goods  for  prompt  shipment  calls  for  acceptance  either  by  prompt
shipment  or  prompt  promise  to  ship.  Since  the  seller  shipped  (i.e.,
accepted the offer) on April 28, the contract was formed on that date.

Catalogs  of  the  kind  used  by  the  seller  are  mere  invitations  to
negotiate because they are sent to a large number of buyers and do not
refer to specific items for sale but rather to types  of  items.  For  that
reason, the buyer's order could not constitute an acceptance. A and B
are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  contract  had
already been formed when the goods were shipped.

27.  A  Under  UCC  §2-314,  an  implied  warranty  of  merchantability
accompanies  every  sale  by  a  merchant  unless  disclaimed  by
unequivocal  language.  UCC  §2-316(3)(a)  specifically  provides  that
the phrase “as is” may be used to disclaim the warranty.

B is incorrect because the implied warranty may accompany the sale
of  a  used  product  as  well  as  a  new  one.  C  is  incorrect  because
liability  for  breach  of  warranty  does  not  depend  on  negligence  or
fault by the seller. Under UCC §2-315, an implied warranty that the
product  is  fit  for  the  buyer's  particular  purpose  accompanies  a  sale
only if the seller knows the buyer's purpose and knows also that the
buyer is relying on the seller's judgment in furnishing a product to suit
that purpose. D is incorrect, however, because the implied warranty
of merchantability does not require reliance on the seller's judgment.

28.  B  In  the  absence  of  an  agreement  to  the  contrary,  one  who  seeks  the
services  of  another,  knowing  that  the  other  expects  to  be  paid  for
those services, impliedly promises to pay for the services by availing
himself  or  herself  of  them.  Although  the  doctor  agreed  to  wait  for
payment  and  to  bill  the  defendant's  insurance  company  directly,
nothing  in  the  conversation  between  the  doctor  and  the  defendant
indicates  that  the  doctor  was  willing  to  look  solely  to  the  insurance
company for payment.

372

If  the  benefit  that  a  contract  confers  on  a  noncontracting  party  was
intended  to  satisfy  a  preexisting  obligation  owed  by  one  of  the
contracting  parties,  the  person  on  whom  the  benefit  is  conferred  is
called a creditor third-party beneficiary. Since the defendant's debt to
the doctor did not exist at the time the insurance contract was made,
the doctor could not have been a creditor beneficiary. A is therefore
incorrect. C and D are incorrect because, as noted above, nothing in
the conversation between the doctor and the defendant indicates that
the  doctor  agreed  to  look  solely  to  the  insurance  company  for
payment.

29. C When either party to a contract breaches it, the other party is excused
from further performance. Since the landowner breached by refusing
to  make  payment  as  required,  the  contractor  may  refuse  to  perform
any further work.

In addition, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages consisting
of the losses that he or she sustained as a result of the breach. This
may  include  profits  that  he  or  she  would  have  earned  if  the  breach
had not occurred. D is therefore incorrect. Ordinarily, lost profits are
measured by the balance of the contract price less whatever it would
have  cost  the  builder  to  complete  performance.  Since  the  amounts
specified  in  A  and  B  are  not  necessarily  based  on  this  measure,  A
and B are incorrect.

30. A An option is a promise to keep a particular offer open for a specified
period  of  time.  If  it  is  supported  by  consideration,  it  is  a  separate
contract  and  is  enforceable  during  the  specified  period.  Since  the
document  stated  that  the  landowner  received  $20  in  return  for  her
promise  to  keep  the  offer  open,  her  promise  was  supported  by
consideration  and  is  therefore  enforceable.  Many  cases  hold  that
consideration that is cited in a writing, but which was never actually
given  or  received, 
that  sham
consideration does not support a promise. A is correct in spite of this,
however, because the facts do not indicate that the landowner did not
receive  $20  from  her  son,  and  because  none  of  the  other  answers
listed could possibly be correct.

is  “sham  consideration,”  and 

An  attempted  testamentary  substitute  is  an  attempt  by  a  person  to
dispose of his or her property after death without the formality of a
will. Since all jurisdictions have statutes that impose certain formal
requirements  on  wills,  a  testamentary  substitute  that  fails  to  satisfy

373

these requirements is ineffective. Thus, if the document signed by the
landowner is an attempted testamentary substitute, the result would be
a judgment for the administratrix. B is therefore incorrect. To avoid
interfering  with  the  freedom  of  contract,  courts  do  not  ordinarily
inquire  into  the  adequacy  of  consideration.  This  is  particularly  true
where parties to a contract are related to each other, or where there is
some  other  reason  why  one  of  them  might  be  willing  to  accept  less
than  actual  value  from  the  other.  For  this  reason,  C  and  D  are
incorrect.

31. D A minor may disaffirm his contract on the ground that he or she lacked

capacity, but the party contracting with him or her may not.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Detrimental  reliance  is  sometimes
given  as  a  reason  for  enforcing  a  promise  that  was  unsupported  by
consideration.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  defendant's  promise  was
supported by consideration (i.e., the plaintiff's promise), making the
plaintiff's reliance irrelevant.

32. C Under the Statute of Frauds, a contract for the sale of any interest in
real  estate  must  be  in  writing,  and  the  writing  must  contain  all  the
essential  terms.  The  price  is  an  essential  term  in  a  contract  for  the
sale  of  realty,  since  the  court  will  be  unable  to  fashion  a  remedy
without it.

Although  UCC  §2-305(1)  makes  special  provision  for  contracts
between  merchants,  providing  that  a  contract  silent  as  to  price  is
presumed to be for a reasonable price, these provisions apply only to
the sale of goods and not to the sale of realty. A and B are therefore
incorrect. Since this contract does not satisfy the requirements of the
Statute of Frauds, it is unenforceable over objection, even though oral
evidence might establish the intentions of the parties with respect to
missing terms. D is therefore incorrect.

33. C Consideration requires a bargained-for exchange. Since the husband
did  not  ask  the  rescuer  to  save  his  wife,  the  rescuer's  doing  so  was
neither bargained for nor given in exchange for the husband's promise.

The  fact  that  a  promisor  calls  something  “consideration”  for  his  or
her promise does not make it so. A is incorrect because the service
was not given in exchange for the promise. Even though the service
rendered by the rescuer may have materially benefited the husband, it
is  not  consideration  for  the  husband's  promise  because  it  was  not

374

performed  in  exchange  for  the  promise.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  A
service  given  in  return  for  a  promise,  however,  would  be
consideration for the promise even if the value of the service cannot
be specified. D is therefore incorrect.

34. C  A  beneficiary  may  sue  the  promisor  only  if  the  beneficiary  was  an
“intended”  beneficiary.  The  test  for  an  “intended”  beneficiary  is
whether the circumstances show that the promisee intended to give the
beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance. Here, the woman
(the promisee) intended to give her niece the benefit of the value of
her house. Consequently, the niece can sue the woman's husband (the
promisor) for his failure to live up to his promise to his wife. A and

Restatement's  change  to  the  terms  “intended”  and  “incidental”

the

35. D The seller's obligation under a contract of sale is to deliver goods that
conform in every way to the terms of the contract. Since the contract
called for delivery of 500 pens, delivery of anything less is a breach.
Since the seller failed to perform as promised, the buyer is entitled to
the  return  of  all  money  already  paid.  In  addition,  since  the  seller
breached the contract, the buyer is entitled to damages resulting from
the breach.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  buyer  is  not  required  to  accept  a
nonconforming tender. If a buyer chooses to accept a nonconforming
tender, he or she must pay the contracted price but is entitled to sue
for damages resulting from the seller's defective performance, so long
as he or she notifies the seller of his or her intention to do so. B is
therefore incorrect. On the other hand, if the tender does not conform
to  the  seller's  promise,  the  buyer  may  reject  it.  Having  done  so,  the
buyer is entitled to damages that resulted from the seller's breach. C
is incorrect because return of the buyer's advance payment may not be
sufficient to compensate the buyer for other damages that it sustained.
(Note: Damages are traditionally measured by the difference between
the contract price and the “cover price” or the fair market value of the
goods involved.)

36. D A party who wishes to make a contract may make statements that are
not offers but rather solicitations of bids. These bids are the basis of

375

preliminary  negotiations  and  cannot  be  accepted.  Here,  the  man
saying  “I  would  consider”  shows  his  statement  to  be  a  mere
solicitation  of  bids,  and  not  a  true  offer.  Consequently,  the  friend
cannot accept and no contract is formed. This makes A incorrect. B is
incorrect because detrimental reliance usually refers to the other party
beginning  performance  or  making  costly  preparations  in  anticipation
of  a  contract.  Here,  the  friend  buying  motorcycle  equipment  and  a
shed  is  unlikely  to  rise  to  this  level.  C  is  incorrect  because  a
statement of future intention is an announcement by a person that he or
she  intends  to  contract  in  the  future.  The  man's  statement  that  he
wanted  to  sell  his  motorcycle  did  not  show  that  he  necessarily
intended to make any contract in the future.

37.  B  Under  the  brokerage  contract,  transfer  of  title  was  a  condition
precedent to the defendant's obligation to pay a commission. There is
always an implied agreement, however, that a party will not willfully
prevent  the  performance  of  a  condition  to  his  or  her  obligation.  If
transfer of title was prevented by the defendant's willful breach of his
contract  with  the  buyer,  the  defendant  thus  violated  the  implied
agreement with the plaintiff and may be held liable for damages (i.e.,
the unpaid commission) that resulted.

Although  real  estate  brokerage  contracts  frequently  require  payment
of  the  commission  when  the  broker  procures  a  ready,  willing,  and
able  buyer,  A  and  C  are  incorrect  because  this  contract  was
conditioned  on  the  transfer  of  title.  “Frustration  of  purpose”  may
excuse performance of a contract where an unforeseen event destroys
the  underlying  reasons  for  performing  the  contract.  D  is  incorrect
because  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose  never  results  in
liability but rather excuses a party's failure to perform.

38. A An accord is a new obligation intended to take the place of an existing
one.  To  be  enforceable,  it  must  be  supported  by  consideration.  To
discharge  the  original  obligation,  it  must  actually  be  performed.
Performance of the new obligation is known as “satisfaction,” and it
is the satisfaction rather than the accord that discharges a contractual
obligation. The agreement of May 21 constituted an accord, but since
the buyer did not pay $45,000 in cash by May 25, there has been no
satisfaction and thus no discharge of his obligation to pay $50,000 as
originally agreed.

While a promise to perform a preexisting obligation is not valuable

376

consideration, B is incorrect because the buyer's original contractual
obligation was to pay before June 14, and his May 21 promise was to
pay by May 25. A novation is an agreement to substitute a third party
for  one  of  the  parties  to  the  contract.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is
incorrect  because  accord  without  satisfaction  does  not  work  to
discharge contractual obligations.

39.  C  Under  the  mailbox  rule,  an  acceptance  is  effective  when  sent.
However, if the offeror never receives the acceptance, the acceptance
has  to  be  properly  dispatched  in  order  to  create  a  contract.  Here,
since the facts state that the writer put the correct address and proper
postage  on  the  acceptance,  the  mailbox  rule  applies.  This  makes  A
and B incorrect. D is incorrect because even if the writer mailed her
acceptance, the mailbox rule would not apply if the acceptance was
not properly dispatched (i.e., she put the wrong address on it).

40. C Most jurisdictions agree that an offer for a unilateral contract cannot
terminate  once  the  offeree  begins  performance.  The  plaintiff's  extra
efforts  to  earn  “A”s  while  her  mother  was  alive  would  thus  have
prevented  her  mother's  death  from  terminating  the  offer.  Earning  the
“A”s  constituted  acceptance  of  the  offer  and  entitled  the  plaintiff  to
the promised bonus.

A is incorrect because there is no rule of law requiring a law student
to  use  his  or  her  best  efforts  while  in  law  school.  B  is  incorrect
because the plaintiff's efforts would have prevented termination of the
offer until she had a reasonable opportunity to complete performance.
Since her mother's promise was not made until after the plaintiff got
into  law  school,  and  since  the  plaintiff  did  not  apply  to  law  school
with any expectation of compensation from her mother, the plaintiff's
law  school  enrollment  was  not  relevant  to  the  enforceability  of  her
mother's promise. D is therefore incorrect.

41. B UCC §2-104 defines a merchant as a person who deals in goods of the
kind  involved  in  the  transaction,  one  who  by  his  or  her  occupation
holds  himself  or  herself  out  as  having  knowledge  peculiar  to  the
goods involved in the transaction, one to whom such knowledge may
be attributed by his or her employment, or a person who by his or her
occupation  holds  himself  or  herself  out  as  having  such  knowledge.
Since  the  buyer  in  B  is  not  in  the  bicycle  business,  does  not  hold
himself  or  herself  out  as  having  special  knowledge  of  bicycles,  and
does not employ a person who does so, he or she is not a merchant

377

under UCC §2-104.

The  seller  in  A  is  in  the  bicycle  business  and  therefore  deals  in
bicycles.  The  buyer  in  C  is  a  bicycle  mechanic,  and  as  such  holds
himself  out  as  having  special  knowledge  of  bicycles.  Special
knowledge  of  bicycles  may  be  attributed  to  the  buyer  in  D  because
she employed a bicycle mechanic to assist in making the purchase.

42. D A prospective inability to perform occurs when a party to a contract
has,  by  his  or  her  own  conduct,  divested  himself  or  herself  of  the
ability  to  perform.  A  party  who  justifiably  relies  to  its  detriment  on
another party's prospective inability to perform is discharged from its
obligations under the contract. Since the hotel executives learned that
the plaintiff had enlisted, and since this would make it impossible for
the plaintiff to perform, they were justified in hiring another caretaker.
Since the hotel ordinarily employed only one winter caretaker, hiring
the  new  caretaker  was  sufficiently  detrimental  to  excuse  it  from
performing its contract with the plaintiff.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  the  hotel  justifiably  relied  to  its
detriment  on  the  plaintiff's  prospective  inability  to  perform  when  it
hired the new caretaker upon learning of the plaintiff's enlistment. An
anticipatory repudiation occurs when a party refuses to perform even
though he or she is able to do so. C is incorrect because the plaintiff
never refused to perform.

43.  B  Ordinarily,  when  unforeseeable  circumstances  make  performance
impossible,  that  performance  is  excused.  When  this  occurs  after
performance has begun, the party who has performed is not entitled to
contract remedies, since there has been no breach by the other party.
In  construction  contracts,  if  the  contractor  is  hired  to  repair  an
existing building rather than build a new one, the contractor is entitled
to  recover  in  restitution  for  the  reasonable  value  of  the  work  done
prior to the destruction of the building. In contracts involving building
a  new  building,  contractors  are  not  permitted  any  recovery  in
restitution  for  the  work  that  was  destroyed,  because  no  benefit  was
conferred on the owner.

A and D are incorrect because the plaintiff did not fully perform, such
performance having become impossible without fault by either party.

44.  B  An  assignment  transfers  the  assignor's  rights  to  the  assignee,  thus
extinguishing  the  assignor's  rights  under  the  contract.  Since  the

378

plaintiff  has  assigned  his  rights  under  the  contract,  he  can  no  longer
enforce them.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  lack  of  contractual  capacity
makes a contract voidable only at the option of the person who lacked
it, and second, a minor has capacity to contract in connection with his
or  her  own  business  interests.  An  assignee's  failure  to  notify  the
obligor that an assignment has been made may result in a discharge of
the obligor's obligation to the assignee to the extent of payments that
the obligor made to the assignor. C is incorrect, however, because the
assignee's  failure  to  notify  does  not  alone  discharge  any  obligation
owed by the obligor. In some jurisdictions, an assignment of wages is
invalid.  D  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  if  the  assignment  is
invalid,  the  defendant  is  liable  to  the  plaintiff,  and  second,  the
assignment was of royalties, not of wages.

45. A The Statute of Frauds requires that a contract to create an interest in
land be in writing. Most states agree that this requirement applies to a
promise  to  create  a  leasehold  interest,  so  it  would  apply  to  both
promises made by the daughter.

The Statute of Frauds also requires a writing if the contract is one that
by its terms cannot be performed within one year. The promise that
the daughter made to her mother could be performed within one year
if her brother died during that period. The promise that the daughter
made to her brother could be performed within one year if their aunt
died  during  that  period.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  UCC  §2-201(1)
requires that a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or
more be in writing. C is incorrect, however, because a house is realty
rather than goods, and because the requirement of a writing is based
on  the  price  rather  than  the  value  of  goods  sold.  Consideration  is
something  of  value  given  in  return  for  a  promise,  but  it  is  not
necessary  that  the  consideration  flow  from  the  promisee  to  the
promisor.  D  is  incorrect  because  the  woman's  conveyance  to  her
daughter was consideration for her daughter's promise to the woman,
and  because  her  brother's  promise  to  share  the  inheritance  was
consideration  for  his  sister's  promise  to  him.  In  addition,  D  is
incorrect  because  the  lack  of  consideration  does  not  relate  to  the
assertion that an oral promise is unenforceable.

46. B  As  long  as  neither  party  has  fully  performed  a  contract,  the  parties
may agree to cancel the whole contract. Such an agreement is called a

379

mutual  rescission.  However,  when  parties  agree  to  a  mutual
rescission, most courts hold that neither party is obligated to pay for
any  benefits  already  received  under  the  contract.  A  is  incorrect
because  it  is  irrelevant  who  asked  to  get  out  of  the  contract  first.  C
and D are incorrect because parties are not obligated to pay for any
benefits they received under the contract before the mutual rescission.

47. A UCC §2-209(3) provides that an agreement to modify a contract must
be in writing if the contract as modified is within the provisions of the
Statute of Frauds. Since the contract as modified calls for the sale of
1,000  widgets  at  $10  per  widget  for  a  total  price  of  $10,000,  and
since  the  Statute  of  Frauds  requires  a  contract  for  the  sale  of  goods
with  a  price  of  $500  or  more  to  be  in  writing,  the  contract  as
modified falls within the provisions of the Statute of Frauds. Since it
is  not  in  writing,  it  is  not  enforceable  over  the  objection  of  the
plaintiff.

C  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  UCC  §2-209(1)
provides  that  an  agreement  to  modify  an  existing  contract  may  be
enforceable  without  consideration.  An  accord  is  an  agreement  to
substitute a new obligation for an existing one. To be enforceable, an
accord, like any other agreement, must be supported by consideration.
Since consideration is a detriment suffered in exchange for a benefit
received, and since the defendant suffered no detriment in return for
the reduction in his obligation, the agreement to accept 1,000 widgets
instead of 2,000 as originally required by the contract is unsupported
by consideration. D is therefore incorrect.

48. A Although the defendant breached his contract with the plaintiff, he is
not  liable  unless  the  breach  resulted  in  damage.  If  there  are  equally
competent gardeners in the area who will perform the same work at
the same price, the plaintiff has sustained no damage as a result of the
defendant's failure to perform.

An increase in the costs of labor and materials would not excuse the
defendant  from  performance,  since  such  increases  are  usually
regarded as foreseeable to the parties at the time they contract. B is
therefore incorrect. The agreement between the man and the plaintiff
may have motivated the plaintiff to contract with the defendant, but C
is incorrect because the defendant's obligation does not depend on the
validity  of  the  plaintiff's  motivation.  A  party's  inability  to  perform
does  not  excuse  performance  unless  the  inability  was  unforeseeable

380

at the time the contract was made. Since the likelihood that one of the
parties  to  a  contract  will  become  ill  is  generally  regarded  as
foreseeable, D is incorrect.

49. D The note that the contractor sent on September 5 demanding $325 was
a rejection of the homeowner's offer to pay $300. An offeree who has
killed an offer by rejecting it does not have the power to resurrect it
by  a  subsequent  acceptance.  The  contractor's  note  of  September  12
was thus no more than a new offer. Since an offer may not make the
offeree's silence an acceptance, the contractor's offer of September 12
was never accepted because the homeowner did not respond to it.

A is therefore incorrect. Since there was no existing offer that could
be  accepted  by  performance,  the  contractor's  commencement  of
performance  on  September  28  could  not  have  resulted  in  the
formation of a contract, making B incorrect. Since the homeowner did
not know that the contractor was installing the screens, and since the
contractor did not have a reasonable expectation of compensation at
the  time  he  installed  them,  the  contractor  has  no  quasi-contract
remedy, and C is incorrect.

50. B Parties to a contract may make an explicit agreement as to what each
party's  remedy  for  a  breach  of  contract  will  be.  However,  such
“liquidated damages clauses” are invalid if they act as a penalty. The
purpose of damages is to put the plaintiff in the same position he or
she  would  have  been  in  had  the  contract  been  fulfilled.  It  is  not  to
punish the defendant for breach. Importantly, where a damage clause
is  keyed  to  the  plaintiff's  lost  gross  revenues,  lost  profits,  or  other
figure not necessarily tied to actual losses, the court is likely to find it
an unenforceable penalty. Here, the clause is an unenforceable penalty
because the plaintiff gets paid the same amount regardless of whether
it  had  to  do  any  work,  and  thus  regardless  of  whether  it  incurred
operating costs in performing the work. Consequently, the clause has
no  connection  to  the  nature  of  the  breach,  and  is  an  unreasonable
estimate  of  potential  losses  to  the  plaintiff.  A  is  incorrect  because,
although the clause is a poor estimate of actual losses, a court will not
enforce it because it rises to the level of an unenforceable penalty. C
is incorrect because the clause was not a reasonable estimation of the
damages. D is incorrect because there is no indication this agreement
is  so  complicated  or  the  industry  so  volatile  as  to  make  damages
difficult to calculate.

381

51. D Even if parties do not expressly exchange an offer and acceptance, if
they indicate by their conduct their understanding that a contract was
formed,  an  implied-in-fact  contract  exists.  Importantly,  if  an  offeree
silently receives the benefit of the offeror's services, a court will hold
that the offeree accepted a contract for those services if he or she had
a  reasonable  opportunity  to  reject  them  and  knew  or  should  have
known that the offeror expected to be compensated. Here, the woman
had a reasonable opportunity to reject the writer's services (they met
each other for an hour over four weeks), and she knew that the writer
was  usually  compensated  at  $50  an  hour  for  writing  lessons.
Consequently, an implied-in-fact contract was formed for the lessons
at  the  writer's  usual  rate.  A  is  incorrect  because  an  implied-in-fact
contract was formed under these facts. B is incorrect because market
value is irrelevant to the analysis. C is incorrect because there is no
fact  indicating  that  the  writer  was  intending  to  make  a  gift  of  her
services.

52.  D  Ordinarily,  a  promise  to  perform  services  implies  a  promise  to
perform  them  in  a  satisfactory  manner,  judged  by  an  objective
standard. A specific agreement that personal satisfaction is required,
however,  is  usually  understood  to  call  for  subjective  satisfaction  so
long  as  the  party  whose  satisfaction  is  required  acts  in  good  faith.
Thus, if the mayor actually believed that the statue was too small, and
he  was,  therefore,  not  subjectively  satisfied  with  it,  the  town  is
discharged of its obligation under the contract.

A is therefore incorrect. If the mayor liked the statue but rejected it
because  he  feared  embarrassment  resulting  from  a  conviction,  the
town would be in breach because the rejection would not be in good
faith.  If  he  genuinely  did  not  like  the  statue,  however,  the  incidental
fact that he feared embarrassment if the boxer was convicted would
not be relevant. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Although  the  clause  called
for subjective satisfaction, it did not create an absolute right to reject
the  work  since  such  an  agreement  is  understood  to  mean  that  the
decision as to whether or not the work is satisfactory must be made in
good faith. C is therefore incorrect.

53. A Promissory estoppel is used by the courts to enforce promises when
the promise induces the promisee to rely on it to his or her detriment.
Here, the plaintiff relied on the promise to her detriment because she
retired when she could have gone on working based on her belief that

382

she  would  receive  a  pension.  Consequently,  the  promise  can  be
enforced  through  promissory  estoppel.  B  is  incorrect  because  “past
services are not valid consideration for a promise.” Consequently, the
plaintiff's years of service prior to the awarding of the pension were
not consideration for the pension. C is incorrect because, although she
worked a few more years after receiving the pension, it was clear this
service  was  not  a  bargained-for  exchange  for  the  pension.  D  is
incorrect  because,  although  there  was  no  consideration  for  the
pension, it could still be enforced through promissory estoppel.

54. C UCC §2-512(2) specifically provides that where a contract calls for
payment  prior  to  inspection,  such  payment  does  not  constitute
acceptance and does not impair the buyer's right to inspect.

The requirement of payment prior to inspection is not an uncommon
one, and therefore not unconscionable, making A incorrect. B and D
are 
incorrect  because  UCC  §2-512(2)  prevents  preinspection
payment from having these effects.

55.  A  Since  the  promise  to  keep  the  offer  open  is  unsupported  by
consideration, it is a gratuitous one, and therefore unenforceable.

Although  UCC  §2-205  makes  certain  “firm  offers”  between
merchants  enforceable  without  consideration,  at  common  law,  an
option (i.e., promise to hold an offer open) is not enforceable without
consideration.  B  is  incorrect  because  it  is,  thus,  based  on  an
inaccurate  statement  of  the  law.  C  is  incorrect  because  UCC
provisions relating to “firm offers” apply only when they are made by
merchants. D is incorrect for these reasons and also because nothing
in  the  language  of  the  buyer's  letter  indicates  that  the  buyer's
beginning  law  school  is  a  condition  for  any  of  the  obligations  that
might  result  from  the  transaction.  It  clearly  was  not  a  condition
precedent  because  performance  was  to  take  place  prior  to  the
beginning of law school in mid-September.

56. B Although the Statute of Frauds might require a contract for the sale of
goods with a price of $1,000 to be in writing, the question asks only
if  the  neighbor's  promise  can  be  viewed  as  consideration  for  the
man's promise. Consideration is something of value that is bargained
for and given in exchange for a promise. Since the neighbor's promise
to  deliver  fire-fighting  equipment  is  of  obvious  value  to  the  man,  if
given in return for the man's promise of payment, it is consideration

383

for it.

A is incorrect because the neighbor's prior services were not given in
exchange for the man's promise. C is incorrect because the doctrine
of  promissory  estoppel  may  make  a  contract  enforceable  in  the
absence of consideration, but although detrimental reliance may take
the  place  of  consideration,  it  is  not  consideration  unless  bargained
for.  Although  the  kind  of  written  memorandum  referred  to  in  D
sometimes satisfies the requirement of a writing, it is not relevant to
the question of consideration or the lack of it.

57. C  UCC  §2-306  states  that  “a  term  which  measures  the  quantity  by  the
output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual
output  or  requirements  as  may  occur  in  good  faith,  except  that  no
quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the
absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable
prior  output  or  requirements  may  be  tendered  or  demanded.”
Comment 2 to §2-306 states that requirements and output contracts do
not  “lack  mutuality  of  obligation  since  under  this  section,  the  party
who  will  determine  quantity  is  required  to  operate  his  plant  or
conduct  his  business  in  good  faith  and  according  to  commercial
standards of fair dealing in the trade so that his output or requirements
will  approximate  a  reasonably  foreseeable  figure.”  Under  a
requirements contract, the buyer promises that he or she will buy all
of his or her requirements from the seller. This promise, coupled with
the  buyer's  good  faith  obligation  to  order  reasonable  quantities,
constitutes consideration for the seller's counter-promise to meet the
buyer's needs. Here, the airline bound itself to act reasonably and in
good  faith  in  estimating  the  quantities  of  fuel  it  required.  Since  the
airline was bound, the supplier's return promise was not void for lack
of mutuality of obligation. Consequently, B is incorrect. A and D are
incorrect because part of the purpose of a requirements contract such
as  this  one  is  to  receive  goods  at  predictable  price.  Thus,  wars
pushing up prices and other price increases are likely foreseeable.

58. B An assignment is effective only if the assignor has given up all rights
under the assigned contract. Thus, if the singer has made an effective
assignment, he no longer has any rights against the defendant.

A  is  incorrect  for  several  reasons:  First,  since  the  contract  was  for
the  singer's  business,  the  singer's  infancy  is  probably  irrelevant;
second, even if the singer's infancy at the time of his contract with the

384

defendant  is  relevant,  it  makes  the  contract  voidable  at  the  singer's
option,  not  the  defendant's;  and,  third,  if  the  singer's  infancy
invalidated  the  assignments,  the  defendant  would  not  benefit  in  the
singer's action against it. C is incorrect because the agreement was to
pay  for  the  recording  session  whether  or  not  a  record  was  ever
released. D is incorrect because the singer was probably a contractor
rather  than  an  employee  and  because  if  the  assignments  were  held
invalid, the defendant would have to pay the singer.

59.  C  A  condition  precedent  is  an  event  that  must  occur  before  a  party's
obligation  to  perform  under  a  contract  becomes  absolute.  Since  the
agreement provided that the defendant would be under no obligation
to  pay  unless  he  was  satisfied  with  the  product,  satisfaction  was  a
condition precedent to his obligation to accept and pay for the door.
Ordinarily,  a  contract  making  a  buyer's  satisfaction  a  condition
precedent to his or her obligation is held to require that the goods be
satisfactory  to  the  reasonable  person  (i.e.,  objective  satisfaction).
However, where the agreement calls for the design of something to be
personally identified with the buyer, as here, it is more likely that the
parties intended the buyer's own personal satisfaction (i.e., subjective
satisfaction)  to  be  the  standard.  If  so,  the  defendant's  dissatisfaction
with  the  product,  so  long  as  it  was  based  on  good  faith,  would
prevent  the  defendant  from  being  obligated  to  purchase  the  door.
While it is not certain that a court would come to this conclusion, the
argument  set  forth  in  C  is  the  only  one  listed  that  could  possibly
support the defendant's position.

A is incorrect because the Statue of Frauds does not apply to goods
that are specially designed for the buyer and which, therefore, would
not be readily salable in the regular course of business. A unilateral
contract is one in which the promisor has agreed to do something in
return for a specified act by the promisee (i.e., a promise for an act),
and, therefore, one in which only one party is bound to perform. B is
incorrect  because  the  agreement  between  the  defendant  and  the
plaintiff  was  an  exchange  of  promises,  each  party's  promise  being
given  in  exchange  for  the  other  party's  promise  (i.e.,  a  bilateral
contract). If the plaintiff were able to sell the door to another buyer,
her  damages  might  be  mitigated  to  some  extent.  D  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  mere  possibility  that  damages  might  thus  be
mitigated is not sufficient to defeat the plaintiff's substantive rights.

385

60. B Even if a defendant can show that a plaintiff never overtly bargained
for  the  defendant's  promise  to  do  something,  as  long  as  a  court
concludes that the defendant's promise induced the plaintiff's promise
or performance, the fact that the defendant didn't expressly bargain in
return for that promise doesn't matter. Here, there was consideration
because  the  landfill  offered  the  plastic  for  free  because  it  wanted
someone else to come remove it, and thus save the landfill the cost of
disposing of the plastic itself.

A is incorrect because there is no fact showing that the construction
firm  detrimentally  relied  on  the  landfill's  promise  (e.g.,  buying  a
special  machine  for  the  plastic,  etc.).  C  is  incorrect  because  the
“bargain”  theory  of  consideration  does  not  mean  the  parties  must
actually bargain over the terms of the agreement — it just means the
promise made by the defendant and the detriment to the plaintiff must
induce each other. D is incorrect because this was not a gift situation.
The landfill wanted to have the plastic hauled away for free, and the
construction firm wanted the plastic and agreed to do so.

61. A Specific performance is a remedy that may coexist with the remedy of
damages. Thus, its availability does not depend on the availability of
damages — liquidated or otherwise.

B  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect,  since  specific
performance  is  available  as  a  remedy  for  the  seller's  breach  of  a
contract for the sale of realty.

62. B The parol evidence rule prohibits the admission of extrinsic evidence
of  a  prior  or  contemporaneous  agreement  to  contradict,  vary,  or
modify  the  terms  of  an  unambiguous  written  contract  that  the  parties
intended  to  be  a  final  and  complete  expression  of  their  agreement.
Almost  all  jurisdictions,  however,  permit  extrinsic  evidence  to  be
used to establish that the writing is ambiguous, and, if so, to explain
the ambiguity.

A is incorrect since it does not recognize that oral testimony may be
used to explain the ambiguity. C is incorrect for the same reason, in
spite of a general rule of construction that requires the resolution of
unexplained ambiguities against the party who drafted the contract. D
is  incorrect  since  even  if  the  writing  was  a  complete  expression  of
the  parties'  agreement,  oral  testimony  is  admissible  to  explain
ambiguities.

63.  D  A  promise  to  forbear  or  abandon  a  civil  claim  in  return  for  some
payment by the promisee is referred to as a compromise. The promise
to  forbear  is  sufficient  consideration  for  the  promisee's  promise  to
pay if the claim could have been asserted in good faith. Although the
facts do not indicate whether the plaintiff believed in good faith that
he  had  a  claim  against  the  mother,  D  is  the  only  theory  listed  that
might have any prospect of success.

A is incorrect since the husband's promise was given in exchange for
the  plaintiff's  “promise  to  make  no  claim,”  and  a  unilateral  contract
involves a promise that is given in exchange for an act rather than a
promise.  B  is  incorrect  since  the  facts  do  not  indicate  any  unjust
enrichment,  and  since,  even  if  they  did,  unjust  enrichment  is  not,
alone,  enough  to  result  in  liability.  C  is  incorrect  since  promissory
estoppel  requires  detrimental  reliance  by  the  promisee,  and  there  is
no fact indicating detrimental reliance by the plaintiff.

64.  A  An  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract  involves  an  offer  to  exchange  a
promise  for  an  act.  Since  the  notice  offered  a  prize  to  the  student
achieving the highest Grade Point Average and did not ask students to
make  any  promise  or  agreement  that  they  would  do  so,  it  was  a
promise offered in return for an act.

B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect since the offeror has the sole
power  to  decide  whether  its  offer  can  be  accepted  by  an  act  or  a
promise. D  is  incorrect  since  once  the  student  achieved  the  highest
GPA  in  her  class,  there  was  nothing  further  for  her  to  do,  and  so  it
could  not  be  said  that  she  was  now  obligated  to  perform,  as  she
would be under a bilateral contract.

65. B A promise to pay for services received in the past is usually held not
to be supported by consideration. Here, since the plaintiff's services
were  not  given  at  the  defendant's  request,  the  promise  was
unsupported by consideration and could not be enforced as a contract.
Thus, A  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  the  defendant  received
the  plaintiff's  promise  to  pay  after  he  nursed  the  son  back  to  health.
Consequently,  he  could  not  have  detrimentally  relied  upon  it.  D  is
incorrect because there is no moral obligation to treat the injured for
free.

66.  B  Even  if  a  claim  is  invalid,  a  promise  to  abandon  it  may  be
consideration  for  another's  promise  of  payment  if  the  claim  could

387

have been asserted in good faith. If the plaintiff did not believe that it
was entitled to the patent rights, it could not have asserted its claim in
good faith, and its promise to abandon the claim would not have been
consideration for the defendant's promise.

If the plaintiff's claim was asserted in good faith, abandonment of the
claim  was  consideration  for  the  defendant's  promise  of  payment,
regardless of whether the employment contract was enforceable. A is
therefore incorrect. C is incorrect since it indicates that the plaintiff's
promise to abandon the claim was made in good faith, which would
make it good consideration for the defendant's promise. D is incorrect
because abandonment of an invalid claim may be consideration for a
promise to pay, so long as the person abandoning the claim believes
in good faith that it is a valid one.

67. C The term FOB requires the seller to deliver the goods on board the
carrier at the place specified, and the risk of loss does not pass to the
buyer until the seller has done so. Since this contract was “FOB the
defendant's factory,” the plaintiff's obligation was to deliver it there,
and the risk of loss did not pass until she did so.

A and B are therefore incorrect. D is incorrect for two reasons: First,
the term “public enemy” refers to a person, group, or nation waging
war against the United States, and second, because while interference
by a public enemy might relieve a seller of the obligation to deliver,
it does not pass the risk of loss to a buyer.

68. D When a promise is made with the intent that its benefit flow to a third
person, that person is an intended beneficiary of the promise. When
that benefit is intended to satisfy an obligation that the promisee owes
to the third party, the third party is an intended creditor beneficiary.
According  to  the  Restatement  2d,  a  promise  is  enforceable  by  an
intended creditor beneficiary when he or she relies upon or assents to
the arrangement. Since the beneficiary is presumed to have assented
when  notified  of  the  contract,  and  since  the  contractor  notified  the
plaintiff, the plaintiff may enforce the contractor's son's promise even
though there is no privity between them.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,
because  non-assignability  would  prevent 
from
recovering but could not be raised as a defense by that assignee, and
second,  because  obligations  under  a  construction  contract  may

the  assignee 

388

generally  be  assigned  to  any  competent  contractor.  C  is  incorrect
because  the  preexisting  obligation  that  the  contractor  owed  the
plaintiff,  and  which  the  contractor's  contract  with  his  son  was
designed to satisfy, made the plaintiff a creditor rather than a donee
beneficiary.

69. A Since a contract is a meeting of minds, a person who does not know
the  legal  consequences  of  his  or  her  act  is  incapable  of  contracting.
Where  the  incapacity  results  from  intoxication,  some  jurisdictions
require  proof  that  the  other  party  was  aware  of  the  intoxication  and
the  resulting  incapacity.  Although  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  buyer
was sufficiently aware of the seller's incapacity, the additional fact in
A is the only one listed that could help the seller's defense.

So  long  as  the  seller  knew  the  legal  consequences  of  her  act,  her
motivation  is  irrelevant.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  So  long  as  the
consideration given for a promise has value, courts, recognizing that
contracting parties may be motivated by factors other than monetary
worth,  do  not  usually  inquire  into  the  sufficiency  of  that  value.  For
this  reason,  C  is  incorrect.  Although  an  offeror  may  withdraw  an
offer at any time prior to acceptance, D is incorrect for two reasons:
First,  such  withdrawal  is  not  effective  until  communicated  to  the
offeree,  and  second,  the  facts  suggest  that  a  contract  was  formed
when  the  napkin  was  signed,  making  a  subsequent  attempt  at
revocation ineffective.

70. C Although a court may reform a contract by filling in a missing term in
accordance with the manifest intent of the parties, it may not create a
contract  where  the  writing  fails  to  indicate  that  the  parties  had  the
intent of creating one. The January 5 document leaves the price term
to  subsequent  agreement  after  determining  reasonable  value.  It  does
not  indicate  that  reasonable  value  will  be  the  price  or  set  forth  any
method  by  which  the  sale  price  is  to  be  determined.  It  is  an
“agreement to agree,” and as such, it does not manifest an intention to
be bound to any particular terms.

A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Specific  performance  may  be
available in an action for breach of a contract for the sale of a chattel
if  the  chattel  is  unique.  Since  a  trained,  talking  bird  is  probably
unique, D is incorrect.

71.  C  Losses  that  are  normal  but  not  inevitable  results  of  a  breach  of

389

contract (e.g., the plaintiff's claim of lost business resulting from non-
delivery  of  the  station  wagon)  are  called  “consequential  damages,”
and they may be recovered if they were foreseeable to the parties at
the  time  the  contract  was  made,  and  if  they  could  not  have  been
mitigated by the aggrieved party. If the plaintiff could have traveled to
the  customers'  premises  by  renting  a  car  or  by  using  one  of  the
company  pickup  trucks,  the  defendant  would  not  be  responsible  for
damages resulting from his failure to mitigate consequential damages
by doing so.

A is incorrect because the plaintiff had advised the salesperson that
he needed to use the station wagon for his business, making business
losses  foreseeable.  B  is  incorrect  because  impossibility  excuses
performance only if it results from factors not within the reasonable
contemplation  of  the  parties  at  the  time  the  contract  was  formed.
Here, both parties knew that the defendant was planning to order the
station wagon from the manufacturer and could have anticipated that
the  manufacturer  might  not  deliver  the  car  on  time.  D  is  incorrect
since consequential damages are available in actions for breach of a
sales contract.

72. A Even though no contract exists, a party can recover from another on a
quasi-contract (i.e., a contract implied-in-law) theory when he or she
rendered  a  service  to  the  other  with  the  reasonable  expectation  of
compensation.  Thus,  if  the  doctor  had  a  reasonable  expectation  of
payment at the time she rendered medical services to the pedestrian,
she may recover on a quasi-contract theory.

A  contract  is  implied-in-fact  when,  although  the  parties  have  not

circumstances.  Since  the  pedestrian  remained  unconscious  for  the
entire period during which the doctor rendered services, he could not
have  acted  in  a  way  that  manifested  the  intent  to  make  a  binding
contract.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  quasi-
contract  recovery  is  usually  based  on  the  value  of  the  detriment
sustained  by  the  plaintiff,  rather  than  that  of  the  benefit  received  by
the  defendant.  Where  they  exist,  “good  Samaritan”  statutes  protect
physicians  against  negligence  liability  in  connection  with  treatment
that  they  render  without  expectation  of  compensation  at  accident  or
other  emergency  scenes.  Although  “good  Samaritan”  statutes  do  not

390

extend  this  protection  to  a  physician  who  charges  for  his  or  her
services, they do not prevent him or her from doing so. D is therefore
incorrect.

73. C A contract for the lease of realty is not illegal even though the lessee
might have an illegal activity in mind when he or she enters into the
lease.

Ordinarily,  the  courts  will  not  aid  either  party  to  an  illegal  contract
unless  the  party  seeking  relief  was  not  equally  guilty  (i.e.,  in  pari
delicto)  with  the  other  party.  A  and  B  are  incorrect,  however,
because the contract to lease realty did not have an illegal purpose. D
is  incorrect  because  impossibility  excuses  performance  only  if  it  is
brought about through no fault of the breaching party.

74. A Even in equitable claims, courts judge the adequacy of consideration
as of the time the contract was made, not as of the time the contract
was  allegedly  breached.  Thus,  if  it  appeared  fair  at  the  time  of
contracting,  a  court  will  find  it  enforceable.  Here,  at  the  time  of
contracting, the plaintiff gave up her job and promised to take care of
the defendant, a job of unknown difficulty and duration. Consequently,
the defendant's promise will be enforced, and the plaintiff is entitled
to specific performance. B  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  question
here regarding the defendant's intent to gift the property. C is incorrect
because  even  though  the  house  and  farm  were  worth  more  than  the
services actually performed by the plaintiff, the contract as it stood at
the  time  of  contracting  was  not  grossly  unfair  or  inequitable.  D  is
incorrect because the issue is the agreement between the plaintiff and
the defendant, not the will.

75. A  An  offer  is  a  manifestation  of  willingness  to  be  bound  to  specified
terms  that  gives  an  offeree  the  power  to  create  a  contract  by
accepting.  Since  an  advertisement  rarely  does  this,  it  is  usually
regarded as a mere invitation for offers rather than as an offer unless
the  circumstances 
the
advertisement did so with the intent of empowering another to turn it
into a binding contract simply by accepting it. Usually, such an intent
is found only where the advertisement indicates the number of items
on sale and contains words indicating an intent to be bound. Here, the
phrase  “While  they  last”  makes  clear  that  a  reader  of  the
advertisement  does  not  have  the  power  to  turn  it  into  a  binding
contract  by  accepting  and  therefore  indicates  an  intent  not  to  be

the  party  who  published 

indicate 

that 

391

bound.

B,  C,  and  D  are  incorrect  because  the  language  used  in  the
advertisement indicates an intent not to be bound to any person who
responds.

76. D Under the pre-existing duty rule, if someone does or promises to do
something that he or she is already legally obligated to do, or if he or
she forbears or promises to forbear from doing something he or she is
not  legally  obligated  to  do,  he  or  she  has  not  incurred  a  sufficient
detriment to count as consideration. Most courts hold that where one
party  promises  another  that  he  or  she  will  do  what  he  or  she  is
already  legally  obligated  to  do  for  that  person,  the  promise  is  not  a
detriment  sufficient  for  consideration.  Specifically,  courts  want  to
discourage behavior where a party takes unfair advantage of another
party  by  threatening  failure  to  fulfill  his  or  her  obligations.  A  is
incorrect because of the pre-existing duty rule. B is incorrect because
this  is  not  a  situation  where  parties  are  renegotiating  based  on  any
change  in  conditions.  C  is  incorrect  because  while  the  captain  was
likely  under  some  sort  of  duress  when  he  agreed  to  the  higher
salaries,  the  agreement  will  not  be  enforced  because  of  the  pre-
existing duty rule, making D a better answer.

77. D A condition subsequent is an event which, by agreement of the parties,
discharges  a  duty  of  performance  that  had  already  become  absolute.
The  language  of  the  sales  agreement  makes  it  clear  that  the  seller's
promise  to  have  the  downstairs  apartment  vacated  was  to  be
performed prior to payment by the buyer. Since it could not be undone
once  it  was  performed,  there  can  be  no  condition  subsequent  to  it.
Thus, D is an inaccurate statement.

A, B, and C are accurate statements since performances that are to be
exchanged  simultaneously  are  usually  found  to  be  concurrently
conditioned on each other.

78.  A  UCC  §2-102  provides  that  “this  Article  applies  to  transactions  in
goods.”  Although  many  of  the  sections  of  Article  2  create  special
rules for transactions involving merchants, many other sections apply
to all transactions in goods, whether the parties are merchants or not.
Therefore, B  is  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  many  commercial
transactions (e.g., sales of realty) are not “transactions in goods” and,
therefore,  are  not  covered  by  Article  2.  D  is  incorrect  because

392

transactions in services are not covered by Article 2.

79. C A promise that is unenforceable for lack of consideration or because
it  fails  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the  Statute  of  Frauds  may
nevertheless  be  enforceable  under  the  doctrine  of  promissory
estoppel  if  the  promisee  justifiably  relied  upon  it  to  his  or  her
detriment.  If,  however,  no  express  or  implied  promise  was  made  to
the plaintiff, then promissory estoppel is not applicable. Although it is
not  certain  that  the  trier  of  fact  would  find  that  no  promise  was
implied, the argument in C is the only one listed that could possibly
support the wife's position.

A  person  who  acts  without  having  been  asked  to  and  under
circumstances  such  that  his  or  her  action  was  not  called  for  by  the
situation is sometimes referred to as an “officious intermeddler” and
is prevented from receiving compensation for his or her performance.
A is incorrect because the wife asked for help, and also because the
emergency  called  for  the  plaintiff's  action.  In  a  claim  based  on
promissory  estoppel,  the  promisee's  recovery  is  not  based  on  the
value received by the promisor, but on either the promise made by the
promisor or the detriment sustained by the promisee. Thus, the value
of  the  pilot's  life  is  not  relevant  to  the  plaintiff's  claim,  and  B  is
incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  under  the  doctrine  of  promissory
estoppel, a promise may be enforceable without consideration.

80. C An offer is a manifestation of the offeror's willingness to enter into a
contract  on  the  terms  specified.  It  is  sometimes  said  that  a
communication is an offer if an acceptance is the only thing necessary
to turn it into a binding contract. The language used by the seller —
“Are  you  still  interested?”  —  leaves  some  doubt  about  whether  the
letter  expressed  a  willingness  to  be  bound.  Some  courts  might  find
that it does; some courts might find that it does not. But if a court held
that the letter was not an offer, C is the only reason listed that would
justify that conclusion.

An acceptance is an unconditional manifestation of willingness to be
bound by the terms of an offer, and is, therefore, the last step that must
be  taken  to  form  a  contract.  The  seller  obviously  did  not  intend  his
letter to result in a contract since he asked the buyer to let him know
whether he was still interested and whether the price was acceptable.
Thus, even if the buyer's letter of March 11 was an offer — which is
doubtful  —  the  seller's  letter  of  April  17  could  not  have  been  an

393

acceptance of it. For this reason, A is incorrect. Under the UCC, the
omission  of  terms  in  what  would  otherwise  be  a  contract  implies
reasonable  terms.  Specifically,  the  omission  of  a  payment  term
implies  that  full  payment  is  to  be  made  at  the  time  and  place  of
delivery.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Similarly,  an  offer  that  fails  to
indicate how acceptance should be made implies that acceptance may
be made by any reasonable means. D is therefore incorrect.

81.  A  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration  is  something  that  is  bargained  for  and
given in exchange for the promise. Although consideration frequently
is found in some benefit conferred upon a promisor in exchange for a
promise,  it  is  generally  understood  that  a  detriment  suffered  by  the
promisee is sufficient consideration for a promise if it was bargained
for  and  given  in  exchange  for  that  promise.  Since  the  defendant
desired  for  the  plaintiff  to  be  near  him,  he  promised  to  give  her  a
franchise if she would move to the city and live near him. Whether or
not  the  defendant  gained  any  benefit  from  her  move,  the  plaintiff
suffered  the  detriment  of  moving  from  her  home  to  the  city.  This
detriment, having been bargained for in exchange for the defendant's
promise, is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of consideration.

A  promise  that  is  unsupported  by  consideration  may  be  enforceable
anyway  under  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  if  the  promisee
justifiably  relied  on  it  to  his  or  her  detriment.  B  is  incorrect,
however,  because  the  defendant's  promise  was  supported  by
consideration,  and  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  applies  only
in the absence of consideration. It is sometimes argued that where a
promise  is  made  to  confer  a  benefit  on  another  person  in  return  for
some act that is of no benefit to the promisor, the promise is one for a
conditional  gift  and  is  therefore  unenforceable.  This  argument  does
not  apply,  however,  where  the  detriment  suffered  by  the  promisee
was something that the promisor wanted and was an inducement for
the promisor's promise. Since the defendant desired for the plaintiff
to live near him in the city, and since it was this desire that motivated
his promise to her, C is incorrect. Affection is not enough to support a
promise  and  cannot  serve  as  consideration  because  it  is  not
something  bargained  for  in  exchange  for  a  promise.  D  is  incorrect,
however, because the promise made by the defendant was given not
merely  out  of  affection  for  the  plaintiff  but  to  induce  the  plaintiff  to
move to the city.

394

82. D  UCC  §2-601  provides  that  if  goods  delivered  fail  in  any  respect  to
conform to the contract of sale, the buyer may reject the whole, accept
the whole, or accept any commercial units (i.e., quantities that may be
sold  commercially  without  substantially  impairing  their  value)  and
reject  the  rest.  UCC  §2-607  provides  that  acceptance  does  not  of
itself  impair  any  other  remedy  for  nonconformity.  Finally,  UCC  §2-
714  permits  a  buyer  to  recover  damages  resulting  from  the
nonconformity of accepted goods.

83.  D  If  the  circumstances  that  resulted  in  destruction  of  the  structure
excused performance by the builder, his refusal to continue was not a
breach.  Since,  however,  he  did  not  perform  as  promised,  his  only
remedy  would  be  in  quasi-contract.  If  the  circumstances  did  not
excuse  performance  by  the  builder,  his  refusal  to  continue  was  a
breach. Even a breaching builder may be entitled to a quasi-contract
remedy, however, if the owner of the premises received some benefit
as a result of his or her work. In either event, the builder's recovery
would  be  limited  to  the  value  of  the  benefit  received  by  the
landowner.  Since  this  was  a  contract  for  a  new  structure,  and  the
structure  was  completely  destroyed,  the  landowner  received  no
benefit from the builder's work. The builder is therefore not entitled
to any recovery.

A seller's damages for the buyer's breach of a contract for the sale of
goods  may  consist  of  the  difference  between  the  contract  price  and
the market value of the goods. The measure of damages expressed in
A seems to be based on this rule, but it is incorrect because it is not
an accurate statement of that rule and because this is not a contract for
the  sale  of  goods.  B  and  C  are  incorrect  because  quasi-contract
damages are measured by the benefit received by the defendant, and
the landowner received no benefit at all.

84. D A condition precedent to a contractual obligation is an event that must
occur  before  a  party  will  be  under  a  duty  to  perform.  Real  estate
brokerage  contracts  frequently  make  the  broker's  commission  due
upon producing a buyer who is “ready, willing, and able” to purchase
on the agreed terms. In the contract by which the defendant agreed to
pay a 6 percent commission to the plaintiff, however, there were two
express  conditions  precedent  to  the  defendant's  obligation  to  pay.
First, the commission was due only if the house was sold to a buyer
who made an offer during a two-month period beginning September 1.

395

Second,  the  commission  was  due  only  upon  the  closing  of  title.
Although  the  plaintiff  found  a  buyer  during  the  agreed  period,  the
house was not sold to that buyer. In addition, title did not close. Since
there  was  a  failure  of  these  conditions  precedent,  the  defendant's
obligation  to  pay  the  plaintiff's  commission  never  became  absolute,
and the plaintiff is entitled to no recovery from the defendant.

A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

85.  B  Under  Rest.  2d  §89(a),  a  modification  is  binding  if  it  is  “fair  and
equitable  in  view  of  circumstances  not  anticipated  by  the  parties
when  the  contract  was  made.”  Here,  the  modification  was  fair  and
equitable, voluntarily entered into, and motivated by events that were
not  anticipated  at  the  time  the  original  contract  was  created.
Specifically,  an  additional  $10,000  per  year  does  not  seem
unreasonable in the face of an “explosion” of new development. A is
incorrect  because  the  modification  is  not  necessarily  enforceable
simply because the city council agreed to it. C is incorrect because of
the  rule  regarding  modification.  D  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no
indication  in  the  facts  that  the  collector  took  unfair  advantage  of  the
city.

86. A One who will derive a benefit from a contract to which he or she is
not  a  party  is  a  third-party  beneficiary  of  that  contract.  If  the
contracting parties meant for their contract to benefit the third party,
he  or  she  is  an  intended  third-party  beneficiary.  At  some  point,  an
intended  third-party  beneficiary  may  acquire  the  right  to  enforce  the
contract  even  though  he  or  she  was  not  a  party  to  it.  Some
jurisdictions  hold  that  he  or  she  acquires  that  right  upon  learning  of
the  contract;  others  hold  that  he  or  she  acquires  that  right  upon
justifiably  and  detrimentally  relying  on  the  contract;  and  still  others
hold  that  he  or  she  acquires  the  right  either  upon  relying  or  upon
assenting  to  the  contract.  All  agree,  however,  that  justified  and
detrimental reliance by an intended third-party beneficiary gives him
or  her  the  right  to  enforce  the  contract.  If  the  plaintiff  relied  on  the
agreement between his parents by cancelling his contract to purchase
a  residence,  he  is  entitled  to  enforce  the  agreement  against  the
defendant's estate.

If the benefit to a third party was intended to fulfill an obligation that
one of the contracting parties owed him, the third party is referred to
as  a  creditor  beneficiary.  Otherwise,  the  third  party  is  a  donee

396

beneficiary.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  distinction  is  based  on  the
intentions  of  the  contracting  parties  at  the  time  the  contract  was
formed  and  because  neither  parent  owed  the  plaintiff  an  obligation
that was to be satisfied by leaving him the realty. The plaintiff was,
thus,  a  donee  beneficiary  of  the  contract  between  his  parents.  C  is
incorrect,  however,  because  a  donee  beneficiary  may  enforce  a
contract if the contracting parties intended to confer a benefit on him
or  her  (subject  to  the  above  rules  regarding  the  rights  of  intended
third-party beneficiaries). If, by its terms, an agreement is not capable
of being performed within one year, the Statute of Frauds requires a
writing.  Since  the  agreement  between  the  plaintiff's  parents  was  in
writing,  its  enforceability  does  not  depend  on  whether  it  could  be
performed within one year. D is therefore incorrect.

87.  B  All  courts  agree  that  a  plaintiff's  promise  to  waive  a  valid  claim
constitutes sufficient consideration for the defendant's promise to pay
a settlement. Additionally, most modern courts would probably hold
that the waiver of an invalid claim constitutes sufficient consideration
for  a  settlement  if  the  plaintiff,  at  the  time  of  settlement,  had  a  bona
fide subjective belief that the claim was valid, and this belief was not
unreasonable.  Here,  the  plaintiff  had  a  subjective  belief  that  the
defendant was the child's father, and it was likely reasonable, as the
defendant was willing to pay a settlement to avoid a paternity suit. A
is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  evidence  of  detrimental  reliance  on
the part of the plaintiff. C  is  incorrect  because  forbearance  to  bring
suit  can  count  as  consideration  for  a  settlement.  D  is  incorrect
because the plaintiff had a bona fide subjective belief that the claim
was valid, and her belief was not unreasonable.

88.  B  An  effective  assignment  transfers  all  the  assignor's  rights  to  the
assignee. If the specialist made an effective assignment of her rights
under  the  contract  with  the  firm,  she  can  no  longer  enforce  those
rights, and the court must find against her.

Since the contract called for payment of $5,000 within 30 days after
installation  of  the  hardware  and  did  not  require  design  of  the
software  until  several  months  later,  the  parties  could  not  have
intended  design  or  its  commencement  to  be  conditions  precedent  to
payment.  A  is  therefore  not  an  effective  argument.  C  is  incorrect
because the contract apportioned $6,000 to the value of the hardware,
making the obligation to pay (at least the initial $5,000) unrelated to

397

fulfillment  of  other  obligations  under  the  contract.  A  divisible
contract  is  one  in  which  separate  obligations  are  regarded  as
separately enforceable agreements. If this contract was divisible, then
the obligation to pay for the hardware already delivered would not be
dependent  on  any  other  obligation.  D  is  incorrect  because  this
argument would hurt, rather than help, the firm's cause.

89.  D  Ordinarily,  an  order  to  buy  goods  for  current  shipment  will  be
deemed  accepted  if  the  seller  ships  conforming  or  non-conforming
goods. However, “such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not
constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that
the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.” UCC
§2-206(1)(b).  Importantly,  when  a  seller  makes  an  accommodation
shipment,  the  shipment  is  treated  as  a  counteroffer  of  the  goods  that
have  been  shipped  as  they  are.  When  the  buyer  receives  the
nonconforming  goods,  he  or  she  can:  (1)  keep  the  nonconforming
goods, in which case there is a contract for the goods as they are, at
the  price  the  seller  has  indicated  he  or  she  will  charge  for  them;  or
(2) the buyer can reject the shipment and thus prevent a contract from
coming  into  existence  at  all.  However,  the  buyer  cannot  hold  the
seller in breach for having shipped nonconforming goods or demand
conforming goods. Under the facts here, based on the manufacturer's
notice, the manufacturer's shipment of the 50 vials was a counteroffer.
Consequently, there was never a contract for the other 950 vials, and
the distributor is not entitled to specific performance. Thus, A and B
are incorrect. C is incorrect because the issue is whether there was an
accommodation,  not  anything  regarding  the  distributor's  business
practices.

90.  C  Ordinarily,  a  promise  is  unenforceable  unless  supported  by
involves  a  bargained-for
consideration.  Since  consideration 
exchange, a preexisting obligation cannot serve as consideration for a
new  promise,  since  it  was  not  given  in  exchange  for  that  promise.
Except for the $250 per month that the plaintiff was already obligated
to  pay  the  defendant,  the  plaintiff  gave  nothing  in  return  for  the
defendant's promise to deliver the tiger. Thus, the defendant's promise
was unsupported by consideration and is therefore unenforceable.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  UCC  defines  the  term
merchant in terms of the sale of goods, not services, so there can be
no merchant as to the sale of services, and second, the requirement of

398

consideration is not suspended when one of the parties to a promise
is  a  merchant.  UCC  §2-209  provides  that  an  agreement  modifying  a
contract under UCC Article 2 needs no consideration to be binding. B
is incorrect, however, because under UCC §2-102, Article 2 applies
only to transactions in goods. Since the original contract between the
defendant  and  the  plaintiff  was  for  veterinary  services,  it  does  not
come under Article 2. Therefore, UCC §2-209 does not apply to the
attempted  modification.  D  is  incorrect  because  an  agreement  to
modify  a  contract  need  not  be  in  writing  to  be  valid  unless  the
contract,  as  modified,  comes  within  the  provisions  of  the  Statute  of
Frauds. Since the Statute of Frauds requires a contract for the sale of
goods with a price of $500 or more to be in writing, and since this
agreement  —  even  as  modified  —  called  for  services  and  goods
without a price of $500 or more, it does not fall within the provisions
of the Statute of Frauds.

91. A Under UCC §2-606, acceptance occurs when the buyer fails to make
an effective rejection. Under §2-602, rejection must be made within a
reasonable  time  after  delivery  and  is  ineffective  unless  the  buyer
seasonably  notifies  the  seller.  Since  the  retailer  was  aware  of  the
nonconformity the day the boards were delivered but failed to notify
the  wholesaler  of  the  nonconformity  until  the  wholesaler  sued  him
four  months  later,  he  accepted  the  boards.  Ordinarily,  a  buyer  who
accepts  the  nonconforming  goods  may  claim  damages  as  a  setoff
against the contract price. Under UCC §2-607, however, a buyer who
accepts delivery of nonconforming goods and fails to notify the seller
within  a  reasonable  time  after  discovering  the  nonconformity  is
barred from any remedy.

B  is  incorrect  because  a  buyer  who  notifies  the  seller  within  a
reasonable  time  may  revoke  his  or  her  acceptance  or  may  use
damages resulting from nonconformity of the goods as a setoff against
the  contract  price.  Although  the  boards  did  not  conform  to  the
contract  of  sale,  C  is  incorrect  because  the  retailer  failed  to
seasonably notify the wholesaler of the nonconformity. D is incorrect
because it has no basis in existing law. Even if the seller could have
avoided the nonconformity by making a reasonable inspection, he or
she  is  entitled  to  collect  the  contract  price  of  goods  that  the  buyer
accepts without notifying him or her of the nonconformity.

92. D Consideration usually consists of some legal detriment suffered by the

399

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

promisee that is given in exchange for the promisor's promise. Since
the manufacturer gave nothing in return for the engine maker's promise
to  keep  the  offer  open,  her  promise  was  not  supported  by
consideration.

Under  UCC  §2-205,  an  assurance  given  by  a  merchant  in  a  signed
writing that an offer regarding the sale of goods will be held open is
called a “firm offer,” and may be enforced without consideration. A
is incorrect, however, because although such an offer may be binding
without consideration, it is not supported by consideration unless the
offeree suffers some detriment in exchange for it. B is incorrect for a
similar  reason.  Sometimes  justified  and  detrimental  reliance  may
make  a  promise  enforceable  even  though  it  was  not  supported  by
consideration,  but,  although  detrimental  reliance  may  serve  as  a
substitute  for  consideration,  it  is  not  consideration.  Although  a
subsequent  purchase  by  the  manufacturer  might  constitute  legal
detriment,  it  could  not  be  consideration  for  the  engine  maker's
promise because the engine maker did not require it in exchange for
her promise. C is therefore incorrect.

93.  C  Ordinarily  a  promise  is  not  enforceable  unless  there  was
consideration (i.e., something given in exchange for and to induce the
promise)  for  it.  Since  the  assistant's  service  had  already  been
rendered without expectation of payment, it was not given in exchange
for the promise and is not consideration for it. Some cases have held,
however,  that  a  promise  to  do  that  which  the  promisor  is  morally
obligated  to  do  should  be  enforceable.  Since  this  is  an  infrequently
applied  exception  to  the  requirement  of  consideration,  it  is  unlikely
that a court would come to this conclusion. C is the only one of the
arguments  listed,  however,  that  could  result  in  a  victory  for  the
assistant.

A  is  incorrect  because  an  otherwise  unenforceable  promise  is  not
made  enforceable  simply  because  it  is  in  writing.  Sometimes,  a
promisee's  justified  and  detrimental  reliance  makes  a  promise
enforceable,  serving  as  a  substitute  for  consideration.  Detrimental
reliance  means,  however,  that  the  promisee  changed  his  or  her
position  for  the  worse  because  he  or  she  believed  that  the  promise
would be kept. B is incorrect since there is no fact indicating that the
assistant relied on her promise by changing his position because of it,
or that he was worse off as a result. When a person confers a benefit

400

on another with a reasonable expectation of payment, an implied-in-
fact contract may result. D is incorrect, however, because there is no
fact indicating that the assistant had any expectation of payment when
he  rescued  the  defendant,  particularly  because  he  thought  the
defendant was dead when he leaped into the shaft.

94. B If, at the time a contract is formed, the parties to it are operating under
a mutual mistake, the resulting lack of mutual agreement excuses non-
performance  by  either  party.  Thus,  if  both  the  buyer  and  the  dealer
mistakenly believed that the painting was painted by the famous artist,
the buyer's non-performance would not constitute a breach.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the  Statute  of  Frauds
requirement that the writing be signed by the party to be charged may
be satisfied by the buyer's check, and second, delivery by the seller
the  Statute  of  Frauds.  UCC  §2-302(1)  (and  some
satisfies 
jurisdictions  in  non-UCC  cases)  hold  that  if  a  contract  was
unconscionable  at  the  time  it  was  made,  the  court  may  refuse  to
enforce it. C is incorrect, however, because the equality of bargaining
positions in a contract between experts (such as an art dealer and an
art  collector)  prevents  a  voluntary  agreement 
from  being
unconscionable unless one of them deliberately withholds knowledge
from  the  other.  To  avoid  interfering  with  the  freedom  to  bargain,
courts  rarely  consider  the  adequacy  of  consideration,  except  in
consumer  contracts  when  equitable  relief  is  sought.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

95.  B  A  contract  that  had  an  illegal  purpose  when  it  was  made  is
unenforceable  by  either  party.  Of  course,  the  fact  that  one  of  the
parties had an illegal objective in mind when he or she entered into
an  otherwise  lawful  contract  is  not  enough  to  make  that  contract
illegal.  These  facts  indicate,  however,  that  both  parties  knew  the
illegal  purpose  for  which  the  premises  were  to  be  used,  that  the
landlord  agreed  to  equip  it  specifically  for  that  purpose,  and  that
computation  of  the  rent  was  based  on  the  tenant's  profits  from  his
unlawful  activity.  Under  the  circumstances,  the  contract  was  an
agreement  to  engage  in  an  unlawful  activity.  Even  though  the
operation  of  a  “sports  book”  subsequently  became  lawful,  the
illegality  of  the  contract  at  the  time  of  its  formation  makes  it
unenforceable.  Although  refusing  to  require  the  return  of  the  tenant's
deposit is likely to benefit the landlord, public policy considerations

401

justify  such  refusal.  When  asked  to  enforce  a  contract  with  an
unlawful purpose, the court will leave the parties as it found them.

The contract between the landlord and the tenant was not a gambling
contract since none of the obligations depended upon the outcome of
an  event  over  which  neither  had  control.  A  is  therefore  incorrect,
even though public policy does prohibit the enforcement of gambling
contracts. Sometimes the courts will come to the aid of one party to a
contract with an unlawful purpose, arguing that he or she was not in
pari delicto (i.e., equally guilty) with the other party. C is incorrect,
however,  because  the  fact  that  two  parties  were  in  pari  delicto  is
never  used  to  justify  granting  relief  to  one  of  them.  When  an
unforeseeable  change  in  circumstances  makes  a  contract  fail  of  its
essential purpose, the parties to it may be excused from performance
under  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose.  D  is  incorrect  because
the  change  in  circumstances  in  this  case  did  not  interfere  with  the
essential purpose of the contract but rather aided it.

96. C Generally, a buyer's damages for a seller's non-delivery consist of the
difference between the contract price and the market price on the day
of  delivery.  Since  the  market  price  and  the  contract  price  are
identical, the restaurant has sustained no real damage as a result of the
farmer's non-delivery of 1,000 bushels. (Although the restaurant may
be entitled to incidental  damages,  which  include  the  cost  of  finding
another  seller,  C  is  still  correct  because  of  its  emphasis  on  the
restaurant's lack of “substantial” damage.)

Ordinarily,  a  circumstance  that  prevented  a  party  from  performing
will  excuse  non-performance  only  if  its  occurrence  was  not
foreseeable  to  the  parties  at  the  time  of  contracting.  This  is  true
whether  that  circumstance  is  described  as  an  Act  of  God  or  not.
(After all, almost everything a farmer does depends on Acts of God.)
Since  there  is  no  fact  indicating  that  the  April  storms  were
unforeseeable,  A  is  incorrect.  A  breach  of  contract  is  not  excused
simply because the breaching party gave notice in advance that there
would be a breach. There is a rule that one who treats an anticipatory
repudiation as an immediate breach is required to mitigate damages.
That  rule  is  inapplicable  here,  however,  because  the  restaurant  did
not  treat  the  farmer's  statement  as  an  immediate  breach,  taking  no
action  until  the  farmer's  non-delivery.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The
rights  of  contracting  parties  are  not  ordinarily  relative  to  the

402

obligations  that  they  may  owe  under  other  contracts.  Thus,  the  fact
that  the  farmer  owed  obligations  to  the  buyer  under  a  separate
contract  would  not  affect  the  obligations  that  she  owed  to  the
restaurant under her contract with it. D is therefore incorrect.

97.  B  A  unilateral  contract  is  one  in  which  only  the  offeror  promises  to
perform,  and  only  if  the  offeree  performs  a  specified  act.  Since  the
homeowner's  offer  was  to  pay  $1,000  to  the  person  who  “finds  the
thief,”  he  has  made  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract.  As  with  any
offer,  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract  does  not  become  binding
unless  it  is  accepted  before  it  is  effectively  revoked.  Since  an  offer
for  a  unilateral  contract  can  be  accepted  only  by  performing  the
required act, the bar owner could accept the homeowner's offer only
by  catching  the  thief  before  the  homeowner  effectively  revoked  the
offer. (Note: Many authorities hold that an offeror may not effectively
revoke after substantial performance by the offeree in reliance on the
offer.)

Some  jurisdictions  hold  that  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract
becomes  irrevocable  after  an  offeree  substantially  commences
performance.  The  bar  owner  did  not  commence  performance,
however,  so  his  statement  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  make  the
homeowner's  offer  irrevocable  even  in  those  jurisdictions.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  A  bilateral  contract  is  one  in  which  the  parties
exchange  promises,  each  promise  serving  as  consideration  for  the
other.  Although  the  bar  owner's  statement  might  be  construed  as  a
promise, the homeowner's offer made clear that acceptance could be
made  only  by  catching  the  thief.  For  this  reason,  the  bar  owner's
promise  (if  it  was  a  promise)  could  not  be  an  acceptance  of  the
homeowner's offer, and no bilateral contract could have been formed.
C  is  therefore  incorrect.  An  offer  is  a  manifestation  of  the  offeror's
intention  to  enter  into  a  contract  with  the  offeree  on  the  terms
specified,  which  raises  in  the  reasonable  person  an  expectation  that
nothing more than acceptance is required to create a contract. Since
the homeowner's statement expressed an intention to pay the specified
amount to any person who performed the specified task, it is an offer.
D is therefore incorrect.

98. C  A  liquidated  damages  clause  is  a  provision  in  a  contract  fixing  the
amount of damages should a breach occur. Courts enforce liquidated
damages  clauses  so  long  as  the  amount  set  is  reasonable,  the  actual

403

damages  are  difficult  to  ascertain,  and  the  contract  tailors  the
liquidated damages to the circumstances. If any of these requirements
is unfulfilled, the clause is unenforceable as a “penalty.” In that event,
the parties may collect only the actual damages that resulted from the
breach.  The  purpose  of  an  agreement  as  to  liquidated  damages  is  to
eliminate  the  problems  that  may  arise  in  establishing  or  defending
against  actual  damage  claims  in  certain  circumstances.  For  this
reason,  if  the  liquidated  damages  clause  is  enforceable,  it  provides
the only damage remedy. It does not, however, prevent the wronged
party  from  seeking  other  non-damage  relief.  Thus,  even  if  the
liquidated  damages  clause  did  not  establish  a  penalty  (i.e.,  was
enforceable),  the  builder  may  be  entitled  to  the  equitable  remedy  of
specific performance. C is therefore correct.

99.  B  The  standard  measure  of  damages  for  a  buyer's  breach  of  a  sales
contract  is  the  difference  between  the  price  that  the  buyer  agreed  to
pay and the reasonable market value or price received by the seller
upon resale in a commercially reasonable manner. Under the standard
measure  for  damages,  the  dealer  would  not  be  entitled  to  recover
from  the  first  buyer  since  it  sold  the  car  to  the  second  buyer  at  the
same price that the first buyer agreed to pay. UCC §2-708 provides,
however, that where the standard measure of damages “is inadequate
to  put  the  seller  in  as  good  a  position  as  performance  would  have
done,” the seller may recover the profit that it would have made from
full  performance  by  the  buyer.  If  the  first  buyer  had  performed  as
agreed, the dealer would have made one profit from the sale of a car
to  the  first  buyer  and  a  second  profit  from  the  sale  of  a  car  to  the
second buyer. As a result of the first buyer's breach, the dealer made
only one profit — the one derived from its sale to the second buyer.
The standard measure of damages is thus insufficient to put the dealer
in  as  good  a  position  as  if  the  first  buyer  had  performed  as  agreed.
For this reason, the dealer is entitled to the profit that it would have
made upon selling the car to the first buyer. Since its profit consists of
the difference between the wholesale price and the retail price, B is
correct.

A and C are incorrect for the reason discussed above. In addition to
being incorrect for this reason, D is incorrect because it is not based
on any of the existing rules for measuring damages, and also because
it bears no logical relationship to damages actually resulting from the
first buyer's breach.

404

100. B A contract may make the happening of a particular event a condition
precedent  to  the  performance  of  a  contractual  duty.  If  so,  the
obligation  to  perform  that  duty  does  not  become  absolute  until  the
condition  precedent  is  fulfilled.  Thus,  if  the  plaintiff's  remaining  in
law  school  was  a  condition  precedent  to  his  mother's  obligation  to
pay,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  withdrew  in  December  2012  would
relieve  his  mother  of  that  obligation.  A  condition  precedent  may  be
express (i.e.,  stated  in  words  or  a  substitute  for  words)  or  implied
(i.e.,  not  stated,  but  capable  of  being  reasonably  inferred  from  the
conduct  or  language  of  the  parties).  The  fact  that  the  plaintiff's
mother's  promise  was  not  to  be  performed  until  July  1,  2013,  might
justify  the  inference  that  the  plaintiff's  remaining  in  law  school  until
that  time  was  a  condition  precedent  to  his  mother's  obligation.
Although it is not certain that such an inference would be drawn, B is
the only argument listed that might support his mother's position.

Since it might take longer than one year to complete law school, and
since  the  plaintiff's  mother  promised  to  pay  within  one  year,  it  is
obvious  that  completion  of  law  school  could  not  have  been  a
condition  precedent  to  the  plaintiff's  mother's  obligation.  A  is
therefore  incorrect.  Consideration  may  consist  of  some  legal
detriment  suffered  by  a  promisee  in  return  for  the  promisor's
obligation. A person suffers a legal detriment when he or she does or
undertakes  to  do  something  that  he  or  she  is  not  already  under  an
obligation to do. Since the plaintiff was not legally obligated to stop
drinking or to go to law school, his promises and undertakings to do
so  were  legal  detriments,  and  therefore  may  serve  as  consideration
for his mother's obligation. For this reason, C is incorrect. The Statute
of Frauds makes an oral contract unenforceable over objection if, by
its  own  terms,  it  cannot  be  performed  within  one  year.  Although  the
agreement between the plaintiff and his mother required the plaintiff
to go to law school and to stop drinking for the rest of his life, these
obligations could have been fully performed within one year since the
plaintiff could have died within that period. D is therefore incorrect.

101.  C  A  transfer  of  contract  rights  is  called  an  assignment;  a  transfer  of
contract duties is called a delegation. In general, contract duties are
delegable  so  long  as  delegation  would  not  prevent  the  obligee  from
getting  what  he  or  she  bargained  for.  Duties  that  involve  personal
services (i.e., that depend upon the obligor's special skills, training,
or expertise) are not delegable because an obligee who bargained for

405

the  obligor's  special  abilities  would  not  be  receiving  them  if  the
obligor's duties were performed by another. Whether crop-dusting is
an  activity  that  depends  on  the  unique  skills  of  the  crop-duster  (i.e.,
calls for personal services) is uncertain. But even if it is, the fact that
the defendant did not herself participate in the activity would indicate
that the plaintiff probably did not bargain for and certainly would not
have  received  her  special  skills  anyway.  Thus,  the  delegation  to  the
pilot  would  not  deprive  the  plaintiff  of  what  he  bargained  for,  and
would therefore not be a violation of the plaintiff's rights.

Although the statement contained in A is an accurate one, it would not
provide  the  defendant  with  an  effective  response  to  the  plaintiff's
claim because if a contract duty requires personal services, it is not
delegable.  If  a  contract  duty  requires  the  personal  services  of  the
obligor,  it  is  generally  understood  that  the  obligee  bargained  for  its
performance by the obligor himself or herself. B is incorrect because
such  a  duty  may  be  non-delegable  even  if  the  delegatee  possesses
skills  equal  to  or  greater  than  those  of  the  delegator.  In  general,
contract  rights  are  assignable  so  long  as  the  assignment  does  not
increase the burden of the obligor's performance. Although it requires
the obligor to pay a different person than the one he or she agreed to
pay,  an  assignment  of  the  right  to  collect  money  usually  does  not
increase  his  or  her  burden  since  it  does  not  change  the  amount  of
money that the obligor must pay. D is incorrect, however, because the
plaintiff  has  not  objected  to  the  defendant's  assignment  of  rights  but
rather to the defendant's delegation of duties.

102.  B  Ever  since  1677,  the  Statute  of  Frauds  has  required  a  promise  to
answer  for  the  debt  of  another  to  be  in  writing.  Since  the
shareholder's  promise  was  to  pay  the  debt  of  the  corporation,  it
would be unenforceable over the shareholder's objection if it was not
in writing.

Although a promise made under duress (i.e., induced by an improper
threat)  is  void,  economic  duress  rarely  justifies  avoidance  of  a
promise.  In  addition,  for  any  duress  to  make  a  promise  void,  the
duress  must  have  resulted  from  some  improper  threat  made  by  the
promisee.  Since  the  economic  distress  of  the  corporation  did  not
result  from  any  conduct  or  threat  by  the  bank,  and  since  the  bank's
refusal to lend money without a personal guarantee was not improper,
the  economic  fears  that  induced  the  shareholder's  promise  will  not

406

result  in  its  avoidance.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  A  promise  is
generally not enforceable unless it is supported by consideration. But
consideration  may  consist  of  either  some  benefit  conferred  upon  the
promisor or some detriment incurred by the promisee. Since the bank
lent money to the corporation in return for the shareholder's promise,
the  bank  incurred  a  detriment  that  satisfies  the  requirement  of
consideration even if the shareholder gained no benefit from it. C is
therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  a  surety  becomes  liable
immediately upon default by the principal debtor and is not entitled to
have  the  creditor  proceed  first  against  the  principal  debtor's  assets.
(Even without applying this principle, however, D can be eliminated
because  the  shareholder  promised  to  pay  if  the  corporation  did  not,
and the corporation did not.)

103. A Novation is the substitution by mutual consent of a third person for a
party  to  a  contract.  By  assigning  to  the  woman,  the  tenant  agreed  to
substitute the woman for him. It may be argued that by accepting rent
from the woman with the knowledge that the tenant had assigned to the
woman,  the  landlord  was  also  consenting  to  the  substitution  of  the
woman  for  the  tenant  as  a  party  to  the  contract.  Although  it  is  not
certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  that  conclusion,  the  argument  set
forth  in  A  is  the  only  one  that  could  possibly  be  effective  in  the
tenant's defense.

An accord is an agreement by which a new obligation is imposed on
one  of  the  parties  to  a  contract  in  place  of  one  that  the  contract
originally  created.  Satisfaction  occurs  when  the  party  on  whom  that
obligation  was  imposed  fulfills  it.  A  party  who  satisfies  the  new
obligation  imposed  upon  him  or  her  as  a  result  of  the  accord  is
discharged from the performance of the original obligation for which
the new one was substituted. Since the landlord's accepting rent from
the woman did not result in the imposition of any new obligation on
the tenant, it was not an accord. Therefore, there could have been no
satisfaction.  For  this  reason,  B  is  not  an  effective  argument  in  the
tenant's  defense.  Consent 
is
willingness  that  the  reasonable  person  would  gather  or  infer  by
observing  the  conduct  of  a  party.  Since  the  landlord  accepted  rent
directly  from  the  woman  knowing  that  the  tenant  had  assigned  the
balance of the lease to the woman, the reasonable person might gather
or  infer  that  the  landlord  was  willing  for  that  assignment  to  take
place.  It  might,  thus,  be  correct  to  conclude  that  the  landlord

is  willingness.  Implied  consent 

407

impliedly consented to the assignment. C is not an effective argument
in  the  tenant's  defense,  however,  because  after  an  assignment,  the
assignor  remains  secondarily  liable  for  performance  under  the
contract.  This  is  so  even  when  the  other  party  has  consented,
expressly  or  impliedly,  to  the  assignment.  The  word  alienation  is
sometimes  used  to  mean  the  transfer  of  an  interest  in  real  property,
and since an assignment is a transfer, a prohibition against assigning a
leasehold  interest  is  a  restraint  against  alienation.  Since  the  courts
look  with  disfavor  on  restraints  against  alienation,  they  are  strictly
construed.  D  does  not  present  an  effective  argument  in  the  tenant's
defense,  however,  for  two  reasons:  First,  restraints  on  alienation,  if
properly drawn, are enforceable, and second, the secondary liability
of an assignor as described above makes the question of whether the
assignment  was  a  valid  one  irrelevant  (i.e.,  if  the  assignment  was
invalid,  the  tenant  would  be  primarily  liable;  if  the  assignment  was
valid, the tenant would be secondarily liable).

104.  A  A  promise  is  ordinarily  not  enforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Thus,  a  promise  to  make  a  gift  is  not  usually
enforceable.  Once  a  gift  has  been  completed,  however,  the  donee's
rights do not depend on the donor's promise. Thus, although a promise
to make a gift may be unenforceable, a completed (or executed) gift
creates  an  irrevocable  right  in  the  donee.  The  completion  of  a  gift
requires an intent to create a property right coupled with delivery and
acceptance of some symbol of that right. It is clear that the defendant
intended  to  create  a  right  in  the  plaintiff.  Delivery  and  acceptance
probably  occurred  when  the  plaintiff  was  advised  of  the  publisher's
promise.  While  it  is  not  certain  that  a  court  would  come  to  that
conclusion, A is the only argument listed that could possibly provide
the  plaintiff  with  an  effective  response  to  the  defendant's  defense  of
no consideration.

An assignment is a transfer from assignor to assignee of the assignor's
right  to  receive  performance  under  a  contract.  Since  the  defendant's
contract with the publisher did not give the defendant the right to be
hired  by  the  publisher  as  a  book  illustrator,  the  benefit  that  the
plaintiff  received  could  not  have  been  received  by  assignment.  B  is
therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because the law of contracts does
not  recognize  any  special  rule  about  consideration  in  agreements
between husband and wife. Although D addresses consideration that
the publisher received for his promise, it is incorrect because it does

408

not  address  the  defendant's  defense  (i.e.,  that  there  was  no
consideration for the defendant's promise to the plaintiff).

105.  D  An  offer  can  ordinarily  be  accepted  at  any  time  prior  to  its
termination. An offer terminates, however, when the offeree becomes
aware  that  the  offeror  has  acted  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  the
offer. When the buyer learned that the seller had sold the painting to
someone else, the seller's offer terminated, depriving the buyer of the
power to accept it. This is true even though the buyer did not learn of
the offer's termination directly from the seller.

A is therefore incorrect. Since the buyer gave nothing in return for the
seller's promise to keep the offer open until February 2, his promise
was unsupported by consideration. Ordinarily, a promise to keep an
offer  open  for  a  specified  period  of  time  is  unenforceable  unless
supported by consideration. Under UCC §2-205, a written promise by
a merchant to hold an offer open for a specified period not to exceed
three months is a “firm offer,” enforceable without consideration. B is
incorrect, however, because there is no fact indicating that the seller
was  a  merchant.  The  standard  remedy  for  breach  of  contract  is  a
judgment for damages. Although specific performance is available in
the  case  of  a  contract  for  the  sale  of  a  unique  chattel,  the  wronged
party may still choose to seek a judgment for damages. C is therefore
incorrect.

106. D UCC §2-202 provides that a writing intended by the parties to be a
final expression of their agreement cannot be modified by evidence of
a prior or contemporaneous agreement. It further provides, however,
that  its  terms  may  be  explained  by  usage  of  trade.  UCC  §1-205
defines the term “usage of trade” as a practice or method of dealing
that  is  so  regularly  observed  in  a  trade  as  to  justify  the  expectation
that it will be observed in a particular transaction. Since the seller's
testimony would show that calling scmods “rock lurgid” is a usage of
trade, it should be admitted to explain the meaning of that term.

A is therefore incorrect. Since the law of contracts does not require
contracting  parties  to  agree  to  the  market  price,  B  is  incorrect.  A
contract  is  supposed  to  be  interpreted  according  to  the  intentions  of
the  parties.  For  this  reason,  usage  of  trade  is  admissible  because  it
tends to show what members of a particular trade intended by the use
of certain language. If one of the parties to a contract was unaware of
a particular trade usage, he or she may attempt to prove this to a court

409

or jury to convince it that the trade usage meaning was not what he or
she intended. Since the trade usage may still be evidence of what the
other  party  intended,  however,  it  should  be  admitted.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.

107. D Contracts frequently benefit persons other than the contracting parties
(i.e., third-party beneficiaries). In general, contracts can be enforced
only  by  parties  to  them.  Under  some  circumstances,  however,
intended third-party beneficiaries can enforce contracts to which they
are  not  parties.  Whether  a  third-party  beneficiary  is  an  “intended”
beneficiary  depends  in  part  on  whether  the  contract  called  for
performance to be made directly to that third party. If not, he or she is
merely  an  “incidental”  beneficiary  and  has  no  right  of  enforcement.
Although the defendant knew that the plaintiff's father intended to give
the  house  to  the  plaintiff,  the  defendant  may  argue  that  the  plaintiff
was  not  an  “intended  beneficiary”  because  the  contract  did  not
require the defendant to perform directly for the plaintiff (i.e., the lot
was the plaintiff's father's). A court might rule differently, but D is the
only argument listed that might be effective in the defendant's defense.

When performance is not designed to satisfy a preexisting obligation
to  a  third-party  beneficiary,  that  third-party  beneficiary  is  a  donee
beneficiary.  However,  when  performance  is  designed  to  satisfy  a
preexisting  obligation  to  a  third-party  beneficiary,  he  or  she  is  a
creditor  beneficiary.  Because  there  is  some  question  about  whether
the plaintiff's father owed the plaintiff any obligation as a result of his
oral promise to her, it is difficult to determine whether she is a donee
or creditor beneficiary. A and B are both incorrect, however, because
both  donee  and  creditor  beneficiaries  may  be  able  to  enforce
contracts  to  which  they  are  not  parties.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
facts indicate that the plaintiff cancelled a contract to buy a house as a
result of the plaintiff's father's promise.

108. B An offer is an expression by the offeror of willingness to enter into a
http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond
contract with the offeree on specified terms. A valid offer creates in
the  offeree  the  power  of  acceptance.  To  determine  whether  a
particular communication qualifies as an offer, it is thus necessary to
decide  whether  the  reasonable  person  in  the  position  of  the  offeree
would  believe  that  nothing  more  than  his  or  her  acceptance  is
required  to  form  a  contract.  Although  the  storeowner's  letter  of
January 5 used the word “offer,” it indicated that it was being made to

410

four different people. Since he had only one diamond ring for sale, it
must  have  been  obvious  to  each  of  the  people  who  received  the
storeowner's letter that someone else might purchase it first. For this
reason, none of them could reasonably have believed that his or her
acceptance  was  all  that  was  necessary  to  form  a  contract.  The
storeowner's  letter  was,  therefore,  not  an  offer  but  merely  an
invitation  to  negotiate.  At  best,  then,  the  first  buyer's  letter  was  an
offer. Since the storeowner did not accept it, no contract was formed
between the storeowner and the first buyer.

A  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  as  explained  above,  the
storeowner's letter to the first buyer was not an offer, and second, if it
had been an offer, it could not have been revoked after the first buyer
accepted  it  by  his  letter  of  January  14.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
storeowner's letter was not an offer. Since the storeowner was under
no  obligation  to  sell  the  ring  to  the  first  buyer,  the  date  of  his
negotiation  and  agreement  with  the  second  buyer  is  irrelevant  in  the
first buyer's case. D is therefore incorrect.

109.  C  UCC  §2-609  provides  that  when  one  party  to  a  contract  has
reasonable  grounds  for  insecurity  about  the  other's  performance,  it
may  demand  assurances  and  suspend  its  own  performance  until  they
are  received.  The  section  also  provides  that  failure  to  furnish  such
assurances  is  a  repudiation  of  the  contract.  Since  UCC  §2-210
provides  that  a  delegation  of  contract  duties  is  a  reasonable  ground
for insecurity, the wholesaler's sale to the plaintiff gave the defendant
the  right  to  demand  assurances  from  the  plaintiff.  Since  the  plaintiff
failed  to  provide  assurances,  the  defendant  was  entitled  to  suspend
performance and did not breach by doing so.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  UCC  §2-210
specifically  provides  that  delegation  of  contract  duties  provides  the
other  party  with  reasonable  grounds  for  insecurity.  D  is  incorrect
because  UCC  §2-210  provides  that  (except  under  the  special
circumstances  set  forth  in  that  section)  a  party  may  perform  its
contract obligations through a delegate.

110. D When parties to a contract agree that one of the benefits of the contract
will  flow  directly  to  a  non-contracting  party,  that  person  is  an
intended  third-party  beneficiary.  If  the  agreement  was  made  for  the
purpose of satisfying an obligation that one of the contracting parties
owed  to  the  third-party  beneficiary,  he  or  she  is  a  creditor

411

beneficiary. Otherwise, he or she is a donee beneficiary. Once his or
her  rights  have  vested,  a  donee  beneficiary  can  enforce  the  contract
even though he or she was not a party to it. Some jurisdictions hold
that  a  donee  beneficiary's  rights  vest  when  he  or  she  learns  of  the
contract; others hold that his or her rights vest when he or she relies
on the contract to his or her detriment. All agree, however, that until
his  or  her  rights  vest,  the  parties  may  modify  the  contract  without
incurring any liability to the donee beneficiary. Since the daughter did
not  learn  of  the  contract  until  after  the  parties  had  modified  it  to
eliminate the benefit to her, she has no right to enforce it.

111. C A non-contracting party who will benefit from a contract between two
other  persons  is  a  third-party  beneficiary.  If  the  contracting  parties
intended that the benefit flow to him or her when they contracted, he
or  she  is  an  intended  beneficiary.  If  they  did  not,  he  or  she  is  an
incidental  beneficiary.  Although  an  intended  beneficiary  may  be
entitled,  under  certain  circumstances,  to  enforce  the  contract,  an
incidental  beneficiary  is  not.  In  determining  whether  a  third  party  is
an  intended  beneficiary,  courts  usually  consider  whether  a  statement
to  that  effect  was  made  during  negotiations  or  in  the  contract,  and
whether performance or payment is to flow directly to the beneficiary.
Since the contract between the landowner and the defendant called for
the  construction  of  a  house  on  property  that  belonged  to  the
landowner, and since there was no mention made of any contract right
flowing  to  the  daughter,  the  daughter  is  probably  an  incidental
beneficiary  and  not  entitled  to  enforce  the  contract  against  the
defendant.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Although  a  contract  calling  for  personal
services  is  not  ordinarily  assignable,  B  is  incorrect  because  the
landowner  has  made  no  attempt  to  assign  to  his  daughter  his  rights
under  the  contract  with  the  defendant.  A  donee  beneficiary  is  an
intended third-party beneficiary to whom neither party was under an
obligation at the time the contract between them was formed. Even if
the  daughter  were  a  donee  beneficiary,  however,  D  would  be
incorrect because a donee beneficiary may have rights to enforce the
contract.

112.  A  Ordinarily,  no  promise  is  enforceable  without  consideration.
Consideration  consists  of  some  legal  detriment  suffered  by  the
promisee  in  return  for  the  promise.  Since  the  plaintiff  suffered  no

412

legal detriment in return for the defendant's promise to keep the offer
open, the defendant's promise is unenforceable.

UCC  §2-205  provides  that  a  promise  to  keep  an  offer  open  for  a
specified period of time is binding without consideration if made by a
merchant, in a signed writing, and the transaction involves the sale of
goods. This kind of offer is known as a “firm offer.” The section also
provides that the maximum time for which a firm offer is binding is
three months. B, C, and D are all designed to trap examinees who are
confused about UCC §2-205. All are incorrect because UCC §2-205
applies  only  to  transactions  in  goods  and  has  no  application  to  the
sale  of  realty.  In  addition,  B  is  incorrect  because  the  section  sets  a
time  limit  of  three  months  rather  than  30  days.  D  is  also  incorrect
because  the  section  requires  only  that  the  offeror  be  a  merchant  and
fixes no such requirement about the offeree.

113.  A  An  assignment  transfers  the  assignor's  rights  to  the  assignee  and
extinguishes  those  rights  in  the  assignor.  Thus,  if  the  plaintiff  has
made a valid assignment of his rights to another person, the plaintiff
no  longer  has  those  rights  and  cannot  enforce  them  against  the
defendant.

A non-contracting party who will benefit from the contract is a third-
party  beneficiary.  If  the  contracting  parties  intended  him  or  her  to
benefit, he or she is an intended third-party beneficiary; if not, he or
she is an incidental beneficiary. If they intended him or her to benefit
to satisfy an obligation that one of the contracting parties owed him or
her,  he  or  she  is  a  creditor  beneficiary;  if  not,  he  or  she  is  a  donee
beneficiary.  Since  the  agreement  between  the  landscaper  and  the
defendant  specified  that  part  of  the  price  was  to  be  paid  directly  to
the plaintiff, the contracting parties clearly intended that the plaintiff
benefit  from  the  contract.  For  this  reason,  he  was  an  intended
beneficiary.  Since  they  did  so  to  satisfy  a  debt  that  the  landscaper
owed the plaintiff, the plaintiff is a creditor beneficiary. B and D are
incorrect  because  a  creditor  beneficiary  may  enforce  the  contract
even though he or she is not a party to it. C is incorrect because the
plaintiff is an intended rather an incidental beneficiary.

114. B Ordinarily, the damages remedy is designed to put the parties in the
position  in  which  they  would  have  been  had  the  contract  not  been
breached.  If  the  builder  had  not  breached  the  contract, 
the
to  his
manufacturer  would  have  a  building 

that  conformed 

413

specifications  at  a  price  of  $250,000.  To  make  the  manufacturer
whole, then, the builder should be required to pay the cost of making
the building conform to the specifications.

Although the building has the same value that it would have had if it
conformed  to  the  specifications,  it  is  not  the  building  that  the
manufacturer  contracted  for,  and  it  would  cost  the  manufacturer
$12,000 to make it so. Since damages should place the parties in the
position for which they bargained, A is incorrect. Since it would cost
only  $12,000  to  make  the  building  conform  to  the  bargained-for
specifications,  it  would  be  unjust  to  permit  the  manufacturer  to
receive  a  windfall  by  making  the  builder  pay  damages  based  on  the
difference  between  the  building's  value  and  the  value  that  resulted
from an increase in construction costs. C is therefore incorrect. D is
incorrect  because  the  manufacturer  has  received  some  value  and
should not be permitted to keep it without paying for it.

115. B An offer is a manifestation of present intent to be bound to specified
terms. One of the tests of whether a statement should be construed as
an  offer  is  whether  a  reasonable  person  in  the  shoes  of  a  person
receiving it would believe that only his or her expression of assent is
necessary  to  form  a  binding  contract.  Since  each  of  the  recipients
knew that there were three other recipients, each knew that his or her
own  expression  of  assent  might  not  result  in  a  contract  because  it
might not be the highest offer. Also, since the seller's letter referred to
the responses that he expected to receive as “offers,” a court would
probably  hold  that  it  was  nothing  more  than  an  invitation  for  offers.
While it is not certain that a court would come to that conclusion, B is
the only option listed that could possibly be correct.

Under UCC §2-205, a “firm offer” is a written promise by a merchant
to  hold  an  offer  to  buy  or  sell  goods  open  for  a  specified  period  of
time. Since there is no indication that the seller was a merchant, his
letter  could  not  have  been  a  firm  offer.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  An
option is an agreement to hold an offer open for a specified period of
time,  and  (except  for  the  provisions  of  UCC  §2-205)  is  not
enforceable without consideration. Since none of the recipients of the
seller's  letter  gave  anything  in  return  for  it  (i.e.,  consideration),  it
could not have been an option. C is therefore incorrect. An auction is
a  public  sale  of  property  to  the  highest  bidder  conducted  in  the
presence of all prospective buyers or their agents. The seller's letter

414

could not have been an auction because it was not a public sale and
because the bidders were not present. D is therefore incorrect.

116.  D  Since  quasi-contract  remedies  are  essentially  designed  to  prevent
unjust  enrichment,  they  are  usually  unavailable  against  a  non-
breaching defendant who has received no benefits from the plaintiff's
work.

A,  B,  and  C  are  therefore  incorrect.  In  addition,  A  is  incorrect
because its formula bears no reasonable relationship to the value of
either  the  benefit  received  by  the  homeowner  or  the  detriment
suffered by the first builder. C is incorrect for the additional reason
that quasi-contract recovery is based on reasonable value rather than
on the contract price.

117. C UCC §2-606 provides that unless the buyer does some act inconsistent
with the seller's ownership, acceptance of goods occurs only after the
buyer has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods and either
notifies the seller of his or her intention to keep them or fails to reject
them.  Thus,  payment  did  not  constitute  acceptance  because  it  was
made before the buyer was given a reasonable opportunity to inspect
the screws.

A, B, and D are incorrect because the UCC provides that acceptance
does not occur until after there has been a reasonable opportunity to
inspect.

118. B Under the Restatement of Contracts, Second, an offer for a unilateral
contract cannot effectively be withdrawn once the offeree has begun
performance. Since the designer began working on the design prior to
the  manufacturer's  attempt  to  withdraw  its  offer,  the  manufacturer's
offer will be held to be irrevocable.

A bilateral contract is an exchange of promises. Since the designer's
performance  was  complete  upon  his  submission  of  the  design,  no
bilateral contract was created by the submission because no promise
by  the  designer  resulted  from  it.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is
incorrect because an offer for a unilateral contract can be withdrawn
at any time prior to the offeree's commencement of performance. D is
incorrect  for  the  same  reason,  and  because,  under  the  UCC,
“unconscionability”  only  prevents  enforcement  of  a  contract  that  is
found as a matter of law to have been unconscionable at the time that
it was made.

415

119.  C  Usually,  a  promise  is  unenforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration,  which  requires  a  bargained-for  exchange.  Since  the
climber's promise was made after the hiker rendered a service with
no apparent expectation of compensation, the service was not given in
exchange  for  the  promise  and  the  promise  is  not  supported  by
consideration. For this reason, the majority of jurisdictions would not
enforce it. Although some courts might enforce a promise to fulfill a
“moral obligation,” C is the only answer that could be correct in any
jurisdiction.

“Good Samaritan” statutes, where they exist, protect from liability for
negligence those who render emergency aid at an accident scene. The
statutes  do  nothing  more.  A  is  incorrect  because  they  have  no
application  to  contract  problems.  B  is  based  on  an  inaccurate
interpretation of the facts: Since the hiker did not change her position
after  receiving  the  climber's  promise,  she  did  not  rely  on  it,
detrimentally  or  otherwise.  D  is  incorrect  because  if  something  of
value has been given in return for a promise, the promise is supported
by consideration even though the value of that consideration may be
uncertain.

120.  A  Upon  breach  of  the  sales  contract,  the  non-breaching  party  is
ordinarily  entitled  to  compensatory,  incidental,  and  consequential
damages.  A  buyer's  compensatory  damages  consist  of  the  difference
between  the  contract  price  and  either  the  fair  market  value  or  the
“cover”  price  (i.e.,  actual  cost  of  replacement,  so  long  as  it  is
reasonable). If the cover price (or fair market value) is less than the
contract price, the buyer is not entitled to compensatory damages, but
the saving is not credited to the breaching seller. Incidental damages
consist  of  the  reasonable  costs  of  repurchasing.  Consequential
damages  are  those  that  foreseeably  arise  from  the  special  needs  or
position of the buyer that result from the breach (e.g., the seller's non-
delivery  causes  the  buyer  to  go  out  of  business).  The  collector
sustained  no  consequential  losses,  and  since  the  collector's  cover
price  was  less  than  the  contract  price,  he  can  receive  no
compensatory damages. However, since the repurchase involved $20
in reasonable expenses, he is entitled to $20 as incidental damages.

B  is  incorrect  because  it  bears  no  reasonable  relation  to  the
collector's loss. C is incorrect because it would award the collector
the  entire  contract  price  in  addition  to  incidental  damages.  D  is

416

incorrect  because  it  would  credit  the  dealer  with  the  savings  that
resulted from his breach.

121.  B  A  donee  third-party  beneficiary  of  a  contract  may  enforce  it.  The
parties are free to modify that contract, however, any time prior to the
donee beneficiary's detrimental reliance on it. Since the daughter did
not  learn  of  the  contract  until  after  it  had  been  modified,  she  has  no
right to enforce the terms that existed prior to the modification.

A  is  incorrect  because  a  third-party  beneficiary  of  a  contract  may
enforce  it  even  though  he  or  she  has  not  given  consideration.  C  is
incorrect because the rights of a donee beneficiary do not vest until he
or she learns of or relies upon the contract, and the daughter did not
learn about or rely on the contract until after it had been modified to
exclude  her.  An  assignment  of  contract  rights  is  ineffective  until  the
assignee learns of and accepts it. D is incorrect because even if the
written  contract  between  the  homeowner  and  the  builder  was  an
assignment  to  the  daughter,  the  daughter  did  not  learn  of  her  father's
intent to create  rights  in  her  until  after  he  eliminated  those  rights  by
modifying his contract with the homeowner.

122. B In an FOB contract, the risk of loss passes to the buyer as soon as the
goods are loaded on a carrier at the place specified. This means that
once  the  air  conditioners  were  loaded  onto  the  trucking  company's
truck,  any  loss  not  resulting  from  the  fault  of  the  seller  became  the
university's. The university is thus not entitled to damages due to non-
delivery resulting from such loss.

A  is  incorrect  because  assignment  does  not  free  the  assignor  from
obligations under the contract, even if the obligee has consented to the
assignment.  As  between  parties  to  a  contract,  one  of  them  always
bears the risk of loss. The fact that a third (i.e., non-contracting) party
may also have become liable for such loss does not affect the rights
that  contracting  parties  have  against  each  other.  C  is  therefore
incorrect.  After  a  contract  is  formed,  if  a  change  in  circumstances
occurs  that  was  not  contemplated  by  the  parties  at  the  time  of
formation  and  which  makes  a  party's  performance  impossible,  that
performance  is  excused.  D  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the
destruction  of  a  particular  shipment  of  air  conditioners  does  not
necessarily make it impossible for the seller to deliver other units that
would satisfy its obligation under the contract.

417

123. C Since the seller's offer was for the sale of any or all of the comics, the
dealer  could  accept  by  promising  to  purchase  any  or  all  of  them.
Since  her  telegram  specifically  agreed  to  the  purchase  of  only  one
comic, the seller may successfully argue that she rejected the seller's
offer to sell the others.

A is incorrect for several reasons. Specific performance is available
as a buyer's remedy when the subject of the contract of sale is unique
because  no  amount  of  money  can  replace  it.  The  fact  that  the  dealer
was a comic book dealer does not establish that she was buying the
comics for resale. Even if she was, damages might not be an adequate
remedy since the uniqueness of each comic (they were the only copies
in  existence)  makes  it  impossible  to  determine  what  her  damages
were. B is incorrect because the seller and the dealer are merchants,
and  under  the  UCC,  a  promise  between  merchants  to  keep  an  offer
open for a specified period of time may be enforceable even without
consideration.  Since  the  language  of  the  seller's  letter  made  it  clear
that the dealer could create a binding contract for the sale of any or
all  of  the  comic  books  simply  by  e-mailing  her  order,  the  seller's
letter was an offer, and D is incorrect.

124. D Since the shop owner's order constituted an offer, and the shipment by
the  importer  constituted  an  acceptance  of  that  offer,  the  terms  of  the
offer became the terms of the contract on July 30. The shop owner is
thus entitled to the discount for which she contracted.

If  there  is  a  discrepancy  between  printed  words  in  a  contract  form
and  typed  words  on  that  form,  the  typed  words  are  presumed  to
control.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  Although  the  importer's  catalog
made clear his unwillingness to apply a 10 percent discount to any but
COD  shipments,  the  shop  owner's  offer  was  to  purchase  at  discount
with  payment  within  10  days.  When  the  importer  accepted  by
shipping,  his  pre-offer  unwillingness  became  irrelevant.  B  is
therefore incorrect. An open account is an arrangement between seller
and  buyer  whereby  the  buyer  regularly  purchases  on  credit  without
executing  notes  or  security  agreements.  C  is  incorrect  because  the
existence  of  an  open  account,  while  relevant  to  credit  terms,  is  not
relevant to price terms in a contract.

125.  D  When  a  builder  commits  an  anticipatory  repudiation  of  a  building
contract, the person who hired him or her may be entitled to rescind
and  be  free  of  all  obligations  under  the  contract.  A  is  incorrect,

418

however,  because  the  builder  is  then  entitled  to  an  offset  based  on
quasi-contract (i.e.,  the  reasonable  value  of  his  or  her  services)  for
work  already  performed.  If  the  landowner  rescinds,  the  builder's
quasi-contract  remedy  might  exceed  the  amount  that  he  has  received
from  the  landowner.  If  so,  the  builder  is  entitled  to  credit  for  the
excess as a setoff in the landowner's action for the cost of completion.
On the other hand, if the landowner does not rescind but instead sues
the  builder  for  the  standard  remedy,  he  is  entitled  to  the  difference
between  the  contract  price  and  the  cost  of  completion.  Since  the
landowner still holds $50,000 of the contract price, this sum should
be deducted from the standard remedy. B  is  therefore  incorrect.  For
the same reasons as A and B, C is incorrect.

126.  C  Under  UCC  §2-511,  a  contract  that  is  silent  as  to  the  manner  of
payment  calls  for  payment  in  any  manner  current  in  the  ordinary
course of business. The seller is entitled to demand payment in cash,
but  if  he  or  she  does  so,  the  buyer  is  entitled  to  a  reasonable
opportunity to procure the necessary cash.

A is incorrect for the reason stated above. B is incorrect because the
buyer is entitled to a reasonable time to procure cash. D is incorrect
because a seller may demand cash.

127.  D  Under  UCC  §2-209(1),  an  agreement  to  modify  a  contract  is
enforceable  even  though  unsupported  by  consideration.  Since,  as
modified,  the  agreement  does  not  fall  within  the  provisions  of  the
Statute  of  Frauds,  it  need  not  be  in  writing.  Thus,  if  the  committee
agreed  to  accept  475  bobbleheads  instead  of  500,  the  company's
delivery of 475 bobbleheads would not be a breach.

The company's inability to obtain the necessary materials would not
excuse performance unless that inability resulted from circumstances
that were not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the
time the contract was formed. Since there is no indication that this is
so, A is incorrect. A buyer who accepts a nonconforming tender may
recover damages only if it notifies the seller of its intention to sue. B
is  incorrect,  however,  because  no  notice  is  required  if  the  buyer
rejects  the  tender.  Since  the  contract  called  for  delivery  of  500
bobbleheads, tender of any fewer is a breach in spite of the fact that
the  committee  may  not  have  actually  needed  500.  C  is  incorrect  for
this reason (and incidentally, because there is no indication that it was
to  each
the  committee's  plan 

to  give  only  one  bobblehead 

419

conventioneer).

128. C The brokerage contract made transfer of title a condition precedent to
the  homeowner's  obligation  to  pay  the  broker.  Since  title  was  not
transferred,  the  condition  had  not  been  met,  and  the  homeowner's
obligation to pay the commission never came into being.

A is not a good defense because the homeowner voluntarily accepted
the  $98,000  offer,  thus  waiving  the  price  condition  that  appeared  in
the  brokerage  contract.  Since  the  contract  for  sale  between  the
homeowner and the buyer was formed on August 1, within the period
of the broker's exclusive right to sell, B is not a good defense. Since
the  contract  between  the  broker  and  the  homeowner  granted  the
broker  the  exclusive  right  to  sell  the  homeowner's  home,  the  broker
would  be  entitled  to  a  commission  upon  the  transfer  of  title,  even
though  the  sale  was  made  without  the  broker's  participation.  D  is
therefore not a good defense.

129.  B  Under  the  Statute  of  Frauds,  a  promise  that  by  its  terms  cannot  be
performed  within  a  year  must  be  in  writing.  Since  the  mother's
promise to buy books for a two-year period could not be performed
within a year, it violated the Statute of Frauds.

Even  if  the  offer  made  by  the  mother  was  divisible,  the  plaintiff's
successful  completion  of  her  first  year  of  law  school  would  have
been  an  acceptance  of  both  its  parts.  A  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is
incorrect because there is no special rule governing a promise to pay
a  cash  bonus;  such  a  promise  is  enforceable  according  to  the  rules
that  govern  the  enforceability  of  promises  in  general.  Since  the
mother's  offer  to  pay  for  the  plaintiff's  books  was  an  offer  for  a
unilateral  contract  (a  promise  for  an  act),  the  plaintiff's  successful
completion of her first year was both an acceptance of the offer and
consideration for her mother's promise. D is therefore incorrect.

130.  B  Before  the  obligor  learns  of  an  assignment  by  the  obligee,  if  an
obligor and obligee agree in a commercially reasonable manner to a
valid modification of the contract, the modification is effective as to
rights  that  the  assignee  has  acquired  against  the  obligor.  Thus,  the
plaintiff  is  bound  by  the  modification.  An  obligor's  duty  under  a
contract  is  discharged  to  the  extent  of  payment  made  to  the  obligee
before learning of the obligee's assignment. Thus, the company should
receive  credit  for  any  payment  that  the  company  made  to  the  man

420

prior to notification of the assignment. Since the company's payment
of  $50,000  to  the  man  completely  discharged  the  company's
obligation under the contract as modified, and since the modification
and  payment  took  place  prior  to  notice  of  the  assignment  to  the
plaintiff, the plaintiff's claim will fail.

131.  D  Ordinarily,  no  promise  is  enforceable  unless  it  is  supported  by
consideration.  Consideration  consists  of  some  legal  detriment
sustained by the promisee in return for the promisor's promise. Since
at the time the sister promised her brother that she would let him live
on the farm, she was already obligated to do so, her promise to him
was not a legal detriment to her and thus could not be consideration
for his promise to share their aunt's estate with her. For this reason, D
is correct.

Even without consideration, a promise many be enforceable under the
doctrine of promissory estoppel if the promisee justifiably relied on it
to his or her detriment. A is incorrect, however, because there is no
indication that the sister relied on her brother's promise to share the
estate. B is incorrect because the brother's promise was unsupported
by  consideration.  Since  the  brother  was  unaware  of  his  sister's
promise  to  their  mother,  it  could  not  constitute  an  implied  condition
precedent to the brother's obligation. C is therefore incorrect.

132. D The assignee of contract rights is entitled to enforce them to the same

extent the assignor would have been.

The defendant's breach of his contract with the homeowner gives the
plaintiff,  as  the  homeowner's  assignee,  a  cause  of  action  against  the
defendant.  A  and  B  are  therefore  incorrect.  Contract  rights  are
ordinarily  alienable,  as  are  other  chattels.  Since  any  chattel  or  right
may  be  the  subject  of  a  gift,  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  gave  no
consideration for the assignment of the homeowner's rights would not
prevent it from taking effect. C is therefore incorrect.

133. A An insurance contract involves an agreement by the insurer to pay the
insured  upon  the  occurrence  of  an  event  not  within  the  control  of
either.  The  payment  agreed  upon  need  not  bear  any  relationship  to
damage  that  results  from  the  event  (although  many  policies  require
that there be such a relationship). Since the insurance company agreed
to pay $50 per day in the event of destruction or substantial damage to
the house by fire, it is obligated to do so.

421

B  is  therefore  incorrect.  The  insurance  company's  agreement  to  pay
$50 per day is not a liquidated damages clause since it does not fix
liability  in  the  event  of  breach  by  the  insurance  company.  C  is
incorrect because it attempts to apply to an insurance contract the rule
that  determines  the  validity  of  a  liquidated  damages  clause.  The
insurance  policy  fixes  the  insurance  company's  liability  for  the
homeowner's  living  expenses  at  $50  per  day  without  regard  to
whether or not she actually incurred such expenses. D is incorrect for
this reason.

134. A An anticipatory breach occurs when, before performance is required,
a party to a contract says or does something that indicates that he or
she will not perform as required. When an anticipatory breach occurs,
the other party need not wait until the time for performance is passed
but may immediately avail itself of remedies for breach of contract.

Since  the  sculptor's  obligation  under  the  contract  was  to  submit  a
statue  for  approval  by  the  mayor,  her  failure  to  do  so  is  a  breach
whether or not the statue would have met with the mayor's approval
when  submitted.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  C  is  incorrect  because  a
breach  occurs  when  a  party  fails  to  fulfill  his  or  her  contractual
obligations, whether or not he or she profits from such failure. Since a
contract  calling  for  a  party's  personal  satisfaction  is  understood  to
require  good  faith,  that  party's  promise  to  pay  if  satisfied  is  not
illusory. D is therefore incorrect.

135. C  Ordinarily,  non-delivery  by  the  seller  entitles  the  buyer  to  damages
consisting of the difference between the contract price and either the
“cover  price”  or  the  reasonable  market  value  of  the  undelivered
goods.  Here,  because  the  eggs  delivered  did  not  conform  to  the
agreement,  the  bar  owner  was  entitled  to  return  them.  Since  he  has
already  paid  the  contract  price  and  has  received  nothing  for  his
money,  he  is  entitled  to  the  return  of  what  he  paid  in  addition  to
damages.

Specific performance, as suggested by A, is available only where the
subject  of  the  sales  contract  is  unique  or  cannot  otherwise  be
obtained.  Here,  there  are  no  facts  to  suggest  that  this  is  so.  B  is
incorrect because it is the measure of damages for breach of warranty
and is obviously insufficient to compensate the bar owner, since the
small eggs have been returned but paid for. D is incorrect because it
does  not  permit  recovery  for  damages  resulting  from  the  farmer's

422

breach.

136. D The buyer's offer was for a unilateral contract. According to its terms,
it could be accepted only by performance consisting of delivery of the
books  to  the  buyer's  home.  An  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract  can  be
withdrawn  at  any  time  prior  to  the  offeree's  performance  or
commencement of performance.

A  is  incorrect  because  an  offer  for  a  unilateral  contract  binds  only
one party (the promisor) until accepted by performance. B and C are
incorrect because an offer for a unilateral contract cannot be accepted
by any means other than performance.

137. C A liquidated damages clause is enforceable (and does not constitute a
penalty)  if  the  amount  specified  is  reasonable  in  light  of  what  the
parties contemplated at the time the contract was formed, if the actual
damages would be difficult to ascertain, and if the liquidated damages
agreed  to  are  tailored  to  the  circumstances  of  the  contract.  Since
living expenses would be difficult to ascertain, and since the clause
calling for liquidated damages was tailored to the contract, the clause
is  enforceable  if  $75  per  day  was  reasonable  in  light  of  what  the
parties contemplated at the time the contract was made.

A  and  B  are  incorrect  because  if  the  liquidated  damages  clause  is
enforceable,  the  buyer  need  not  show  that  he  actually  sustained  or
could not have avoided or mitigated the damage. D is incorrect since
a liquidated damages clause does not constitute a penalty just because
one of the parties hoped that it would encourage the other to perform
on time.

138.  B  Although 

the  administrator's  forbearance  might  have  been
consideration  for  the  husband's  promise  to  pay,  the  question
specifically  asks  whether  the  doctor's  services  are  sufficient
consideration. Consideration involves a bargained-for exchange, and
since the husband did not ask the doctor for the services, they cannot
be  said  to  have  been  “bargained  for.”  (Note:  Although  some  cases
allow recovery on another theory for services like those rendered by
the doctor to the extent necessary to prevent injustice, such services
are not “consideration” unless bargained for.)

The services rendered may have imposed a moral obligation upon the
husband, but A is incorrect because it is generally understood that a
moral  obligation  is  not  sufficient  consideration  for  a  promise.  C  is

423

incorrect  because  even  a  material  benefit  is  insufficient  to  serve  as
consideration  unless  it  was  bargained  for.  D  is  incorrect  for  two
reasons:  First,  courts  do  not  generally  inquire  into  the  adequacy  of
that  which  was  given  as  consideration,  and  second,  since  there  was
no  bargain,  it  does  not  matter  whether  the  services  rendered  were
adequate.

139. D Although an offer can ordinarily be withdrawn by the offeror at any
time prior to its acceptance, the Restatement rule is that an offer for a
unilateral contract cannot be withdrawn once the offeree has begun to
perform. Thus, if the student began making extra efforts in an attempt
to  win  the  prize,  the  company  was  prevented  from  withdrawing  the
offer.

A and B are therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because an offer for a
unilateral contract can be accepted only by performance, making the
student's letter irrelevant.

140. A If a contract is made with the intention of benefiting a third party to
whom neither of the contracting parties owes any obligation, that third
party is referred to as an intended donee beneficiary of the contract.
Since  the  landowner's  intention  was  to  give  a  wedding  gift  to  his
daughter and the contractor's son, the contractor's son is an intended
donee  beneficiary.  In  some  jurisdictions,  a  donee  beneficiary  may
enforce only a promise on which he or she has detrimentally relied. In
others,  he  or  she  may  enforce  it  if  he  or  she  has  assented  to  it.  The
Restatement view is that he or she may enforce it if he or she relied
or assented. But if, as here, he or she has done neither, he or she has
no right to enforce the agreement.

A  condition  precedent  is  an  event  that  must  occur  before  a  party's
obligation to perform becomes absolute. Ordinarily, it results from an
express  or  implied  agreement  between  the  parties.  Since  the
contractor's  son's  agreement  to  paint  the  house  was  made  after  the
landowner's agreement to convey, the contractor's son's performance
could  not  have  been  intended  to  be  a  condition  to  the  landowner's
obligation. B is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect because when the
landowner  entered  into  the  January  1  contract  with  the  contractor,  it
was for the purpose of giving a wedding gift to the contractor's son as
well  as  his  daughter.  D  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  the
agreement between the landowner and the contractor probably did not
create  any  fiduciary  relationship  between  them,  and  second,  the

424

contractor's agreement with the builder was not inconsistent with any
right or benefit to which the landowner was entitled.

141. A Specific performance of a sales contract will be granted where money
damages  that  would  accurately  compensate  cannot  be  measured
because the subject of the sale is rare or unique. Since the guitar was
a rare one, specific performance might be available. Although it is not
certain  that  a  court  would  decide  to  grant  such  relief,  A  is  the  only
remedy listed that could possibly be granted.

If  a  court  awarded  damages,  they  would  be  based  on  the  difference
between the contract price and the fair market value of the guitar. B is
incorrect  because  it  does  not  accurately  measure  the  damages.  C  is
incorrect  because,  while  the  buyer  may  elect  damages  or  specific
performance, she may not receive both. D is incorrect since there is
no relationship between $500 and the damages sustained by the buyer.

142. A By its terms, the UCC applies to all transactions in “goods,” which
are defined as any things that are movable at the time of the sale.

The UCC provides approaches for filling in certain missing terms, but
the absence or presence of any particular terms in a contract does not
determine whether the UCC applies. B is therefore incorrect. C and D
are incorrect since nothing in the UCC definition of “goods” excludes
living  creatures  or  consumer  items  (i.e.,  items  purchased  for  the
buyer's own use).

143. A Although the attorney's refusal to accept the painting is excused by her
reinvestment  of  the  money  in  reliance  on  of  the  defendant's
prospective inability to perform, her refusal of the defendant's tender
discharges the defendant from further obligation to perform.

B  is  incorrect  since  the  defendant's  obligation  to  deliver  is  not
dependent on the attorney's reason for making the purchase. C and D
are incorrect since the attorney's refusal to accept delivery constitutes
a waiver of any specific performance rights that she otherwise might
have had.

144.  B  When  a  contract  calls  for  performance  by  one  party  prior  to
performance  by  the  other,  the  first  party's  performance  is  generally
held to be a condition precedent to the other party's performance. A
condition  precedent  is  an  event  without  which  a  party's  obligation
does not become absolute. Since the contract provided that the buyer's

425

obligation  was  void  if  the  downstairs  apartment  was  not  vacant
within  three  months  after  the  transfer  of  title,  vacancy  of  the
downstairs  apartment  was  an  express  condition  precedent  to  the
buyer's  obligation  to  pay  the  additional  $2,000.  An  obligor's
obligation is discharged upon failure of a condition precedent to it.

A is incorrect since the seller is no longer the owner of the premises
and therefore lacks standing to bring a proceeding to evict the tenant.
C  is  incorrect  because  the  contract  specifies  that  in  the  event  the
apartment  remained  occupied,  the  buyer's  remedy  is  to  avoid  his
obligation  to  pay  the  additional  $2,000.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
contract  specifically  provides  that  the  buyer's  obligation  to  pay  the
additional $2,000 is nonexistent if the apartment is not vacant within
three months after the passage of title.

145. A A contract is formed upon acceptance of an offer. Thus, if the seller's
letter of April 17 was an offer, a contract was formed if the buyer's
acceptance was effective before the offer was revoked. Ordinarily, an
acceptance  is  effective  upon  dispatch  if  communicated  in  a  manner
authorized by the offer. Since an offer that does not specify a means of
communicating  acceptance  authorizes  acceptance  in  any  reasonable
manner, a contract was formed on April 21 when the buyer dispatched
the  e-mail  since  sending  an  e-mail  was  a  reasonable  way  of
communicating acceptance.

Good  faith  means  honesty  and  fair  dealing.  B  is  incorrect  because
there is no indication that the seller failed to act in good faith. C  is
incorrect  because  an  offer  not  specifying  a  means  of  acceptance
authorizes  acceptance  in  any  reasonable  manner.  Revocation  of  an
offer  is  effective  when  notice  is  received  by  the  offeror.  Since  the
seller did not notify the buyer of his change of mind, it could not have
effected a revocation. Thus, D is incorrect.

146. D An obligor is discharged of liability to the obligee's assignee to the
extent of any payments made to the original obligee prior to notice of
the assignment. Thus, if the firm paid $15,000 to the specialist before
being  advised  that  the  specialist  had  assigned  her  rights  to  the
programmer,  it  could  not  be  required  to  pay  that  sum  to  the
programmer.

Since the $15,000 in question was payment for work that had already
been delivered, the fact that the programmer might not be capable of

426

carrying  out  the  obligations  under  the  contract  is  not  relevant  to  her
right to collect. A is therefore incorrect. In general, all rights under a
contract are assignable, so a contract that is silent about the right to
assign  impliedly  permits  assignment.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  A
modification of a contract occurs when the parties agree to change the
performance required. An assignment is a transfer of contract rights.
Since assignment of a right does not change the performance required,
the  right  asserted  by  the  programmer  was  not  the  result  of  a
modification. C is therefore incorrect.

147. D Under UCC §2-209, an agreement to modify a contract for the sale of
goods needs no consideration to be binding. Since a contract for the
sale of an aardvark is a contract for the sale of goods, the agreement
that the defendant made to “throw in a pig” for the plaintiff's daughter
is binding and may be enforced by the plaintiff.

A, B, and C are incorrect because the provisions of UCC §2-209 do
not  distinguish  contracts  between  merchants  from  contracts  between
non-merchants.

148.  B  A  buyer  who  rightfully  rejects  nonconforming  goods  is  entitled  to
damages for non-delivery. Under UCC §2-713(1), these consist of the
difference between the contract price and the market price at the time
when the buyer learned of the breach. Since the retailer learned of the
nonconformity on January 15, B is correct.

C is therefore incorrect. A would be the correct measure of damage if
the  retailer  had  kept  the  7-foot  boards  but  is  incorrect  because  he
returned  them  to  the  wholesaler.  Rejection  of  nonconforming  goods
may be made within a reasonable time after receiving them. Although
the 
the
nonconformity,  the  return  of  the  goods  two  days  later  was  probably
within a reasonable time. Even if two days was not a reasonable time,
however,  the  wholesaler's  agreement  to  their  return  would  prevent
him from making that assertion. D is therefore incorrect.

immediately  upon  discovering 

retailer  did  not  act 

149. C  Although  an  assignment  does  not  imply  a  warranty  that  the  obligor
will perform, an assignment for consideration does imply a warranty
that at the time of the assignment, the obligor has no defenses. Since at
the time of the pawnbroker's assignment to the retailer, the buyer had
a  defense  based  on  the  nonconformity  of  the  ring  delivered  by  the
pawnbroker,  the  pawnbroker's  implied  warranty  to  the  retailer  was

427

breached. The pawnbroker is therefore liable to the retailer.

A and B are incorrect because there has been a breach of the implied
warranty that the obligor has no defenses. D is incorrect because no
warranty  that  the  obligor  will  perform  is  implied  by  an  assignment,
even for consideration.

150. D A party's promise is illusory if that party's promise has not created a
binding  obligation.  If  each  party  has  not  agreed  to  a  binding
obligation, the agreement is not enforceable. Under the agreement, the
butcher  agreed  to  provide  meat  at  $10  per  pound,  but  the  restaurant
didn't  actually  promise  to  do  anything.  The  restaurant  could  order
meat from another supplier or not order any meat at all since it only
agreed  to  order  as  much  meat  as  “the  restaurant  decides  to  order.”
Consequently, the agreement is not enforceable.

A is incorrect because the restaurant hasn't actually done anything to
suggest it detrimentally relied on the butcher's promise. The restaurant
only said that it needed top quality steaks for a “planned” convention.
It didn't say it decided to host the convention based on the agreement,
or  that  it  was  actually  going  to  have  the  convention  at  all.  B  is
incorrect  because  the  restaurant  did  not  bind  itself  to  buying  meat
from  the  butcher.  Under  a  valid  requirements  contract,  a  promisor
agrees  to  buy  from  a  supplier  all  that  he  or  she  requires,  and  the
supplier agrees to supply that amount. If the restaurant had agreed to
buy as much “top quality” steaks as it required, it would have been a
the  UCC.  Impossibility  of
valid  requirements  contract  under 
that  was
performance  excuses  performance  when  an  event 
unforeseeable  at  the  time  of  formation  occurs  prior  to  the  time  of
performance,  making  performance 
incorrect
because,  although  it  would  be  costly  for  the  butcher  to  provide  the
steaks, it would not be impossible.

impossible.  C 

is 

151. D When an unforeseeable change in circumstances makes a contract fail
of  its  essential  purpose,  the  parties  to  it  may  be  excused  from
performance  under  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose.  The
essential purpose of the contract between the landlord and the tenant
was the operation of a “sports book.” Since an unforeseeable change
in  state  law  made  that  activity  illegal,  the  contract  has  failed  of  the
essential  purpose  contemplated  by  both  parties  at  the  time  it  was
formed.  The  tenant  is,  thus,  excused  from  performance  under  the
doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose.  Since  his  non-performance  is,

428

therefore, not a breach, he is entitled to the return of his deposit.

A  is  incorrect  because  the  agreement  between  the  landlord  and  the
tenant  was  not  a  gambling  contract.  B  is  incorrect  because  the
subsequent  and  unforeseeable  illegality  of  the  contract's  purpose
makes  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose  applicable.  “In  pari
delicto”  means  “equally  guilty.”  C  is  incorrect,  because  at  the  time
the contract was formed, neither party was guilty.

152. B An anticipatory repudiation occurs when a promisor makes a positive
statement  to  the  promisee  that  he  or  she  will  not  perform  his  or  her
contractual duties. An anticipatory repudiation by a promisor may be
treated as an immediate breach by the promisee. One who repudiates
before the time for performance may withdraw his or her repudiation
unless the other party relied upon it. Since the restaurant relied on the
farmer's repudiation by making other arrangements for the purchase of
1,000  bushels,  the  farmer  is  prevented  from  withdrawing  her
repudiation, and the restaurant is relieved of its obligation to her with
respect to 1,000 bushels.

Novation is the substitution by mutual consent of a third party for one
of  the  original  parties  to  contract.  Since  there  has  been  no  such
substitution, A is incorrect. Nudum pactum is a phrase that refers to a
promise that is not supported by consideration. Since the promises of
the farmer and the restaurant were each given in return for the other, C
is incorrect. Impossibility of performance excuses performance when
an event that was unforeseeable at the time of formation occurs prior
to the time of performance, making performance impossible. Its effect
is to relieve both parties of their obligations under the contract. The
doctrine 
inapplicable  here  because  performance  was  not
impossible  for  either  the  farmer  or  the  restaurant.  D  is  therefore
incorrect.

is 

153.  C  The  Statute  of  Frauds  applies  to  land  sales,  so  any  land  sale
agreement  has  to  be  in  writing.  However,  under  Rest.  2d.  §148,  so
long  as  a  contract  does  not  involve  a  sale  of  goods,  it  can  be
rescinded  orally  even  if  the  original  agreement  was  in  writing.
Consequently,  even  though  the  original  contract  had  to  be  in  writing
(since  it  involved  land),  the  agreement  was  validly  rescinded  when
the  developer  orally  said  it  was  fine  if  the  farmer  wanted  out.  A  is
therefore incorrect.

429

B and D are incorrect. While the farmer seems to have lied when he
stated he was “talking about selling,” there's no indication he actually
did  anything  regarding  the  resale  of  the  property  or  that  those
statements  caused  the  developer  to  do  anything.  Consequently,  his
statements wouldn't change the analysis.

154.  A  Under  UCC  §2-201(2),  “between  merchants  if  within  a  reasonable
time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the
sender  is  received  and  the  party  receiving  it  has  reason  to  know  its
contents, it satisfies the requirements [of the Statute of Frauds] against
such  party  unless  written  notice  of  objection  to  its  contents  is  given
within  10  days  after  it  is  received.”  Under  UCC  §2-201(1),  a
confirmation letter is sufficient against the sender if it is “sufficient to
indicate  that  a  contract  for  sale  has  been  made  between  the  parties
and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.” Here,
since both parties appear to be merchants, the confirmation letter was
sufficient to bind the sporting goods store when it did not send written
objection  within  10  days  of  receipt.  Importantly,  the  store  read  the
letter and the only thing the store has done is phone the distributor. C
is therefore incorrect.

B is incorrect because the issue here concerns the oral nature of the
original agreement and its apparent violation of the Statute of Frauds,
not any potential failure of consideration. D is incorrect because the
store  did  not  send  written  notice  of  objection  within  10  days.  The
store merely called the distributor 11 days after it received the letter.

155. C Although an assignment of contract rights divests the assignor of those
rights, a delegation of contract duties does not have the same effect,
even  when  consented  to  by  the  obligee.  For  this  reason,  the  woman
will remain liable to the banker for any breach of their contract. On
the other hand, a delegatee of contract duties also becomes liable to
the  obligor  for  breach  since  the  obligor  is  an  intended  third-party
creditor beneficiary 
of the contract of delegation. For this reason, the bank may be entitled
to collect from either the woman or the trucker.

A and B are therefore incorrect. The standard measure of damage for
breach of contract is the difference between the contract price and the
reasonable market value of the services contracted for. In the event of
a major breach, however, the wronged party may elect the remedy of
rescission  and  restitution.  Rescission  involves  cancellation  of  the

430

contract.  Restitution  requires  the  return  to  the  wronged  party  of  any
unearned benefit that he or she conferred on the breaching party. Since
the trucker's refusal to perform is obviously a major breach, the bank
may  seek  rescission  and  restitution.  D  is  therefore  incorrect  for  this
reason,  and  because  it  fails  to  account  for  the  fact  that  the  bank  has
paid the woman.

156. A Contracts frequently benefit persons other than the contracting parties.
Such  persons  are  called  third-party  beneficiaries.  If  the  contracting
parties meant for those persons to benefit from the contract, they are
intended beneficiaries; otherwise, they are incidental beneficiaries. If
a  promisor's  performance  is  intended  to  satisfy  a  preexisting
obligation owed by the promisor to the third-party beneficiary, he or
she is a creditor beneficiary; if not, he or she is a donee beneficiary.
Once  an  intended  third-party  beneficiary's  rights  have  vested,  the
contracting parties are no longer free to modify or rescind the portion
of their contract that benefits him or her. Since the president and the
publisher intended that the artist benefit from the publisher's promise
to employ her, and since this was not intended to satisfy a preexisting
obligation that the president owed the artist, the artist is an intended
donee  beneficiary.  In  some  jurisdictions,  the  rights  of  a  donee
beneficiary vest as soon as he or she learns of the contract. In other
jurisdictions, his or her rights vest only when he or she detrimentally
relies  on  the  contract.  In  other  jurisdictions,  his  or  her  rights  vest
when  he  or  she  detrimentally  relies  or  expresses  assent.  Since  the
artist learned of the contract, assented to it, and detrimentally relied
on it by notifying other clients that she could not work for them, her
rights  have  vested  in  all  jurisdictions,  and  she  may  succeed  in  her
claim against the publisher.

B is incorrect for two reasons; First, consideration for the publisher's
promise was furnished by the president's giving him a low rate, and
second,  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  makes  the  artist's
detrimental  reliance  a  substitute  for  consideration.  The  Statute  of
Frauds requires a promise that cannot be performed within a year to
be in writing. C is incorrect because the publisher's promise was to
employ the artist for one year and was therefore not required to be in
writing.  D  is  incorrect  because  after  the  donee  beneficiary's  rights
have vested, the contracting parties may not rescind without his or her
consent.

431

157. B  In  attempting  to  enforce  the  father's  promise,  the  soldier  faces  two
problems. First, the Statute of Frauds requires a writing for a promise
to convey an interest in real estate, and the father's promise was oral.
Second,  a  promise  is  not  ordinarily  enforceable  if  made  without
consideration,  and  the  soldier  gave  nothing  in  return  for  her  father's
promise.  The  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  might  solve  both
problems,  making  the  soldier's  detrimental  reliance  on  the  father's
promise a substitute for both a writing and consideration. To be more
precise,  the  soldier's  reliance  might  cause  her  father  to  be  estopped
from raising either the lack of a writing or the lack of consideration as
a defense. Since the soldier's cancellation of the contract that she had
already made could subject her to liability and will cause her to lose
the  benefits  of  her  previous  bargain,  it  could  qualify  as  detrimental
reliance.  In  any  event,  B  is  the  only  argument  listed  that  could
possibly support the soldier's claim.

that 

The  argument  in  A  is  not  that  modification  violated  the  soldier's
rights,  but 
the  modification  was  unenforceable  without
consideration. It is generally understood, however, that the parties to
a  fully  executory  bilateral  contract  may  agree  to  rescind,  the
necessary consideration being furnished by each party's giving up the
right  to  the  other's  performance.  The  parties  are  then  free  to  make  a
new  contract  by  exchanging  new  promises.  Thus,  the  absence  of
consideration  would  not  invalidate  the  new  agreement  between  the
father and the builder. A is therefore incorrect. C is incorrect for two
reasons: First, the writing did not contain any promise to the soldier,
and second, even if the Statute of Frauds is satisfied, the problem of
consideration for the father's promise to the soldier remains unsolved.
Consideration  is  something  given  in  return  for  a  promise.  Since  the
soldier had married and decided to retire from the military before her
father's promise was made, her marriage and retirement could not be
consideration for his promise. D is therefore incorrect.

158. C Although the usual remedy for breach of a sales contract is a judgment
for  damages,  specific  performance  is  available  to  a  buyer  if  the
subject  of  the  contract  was  unique  or  highly  unusual.  This  is  nearly
always true of contracts for the sale of realty, because every piece of
realty  is  regarded  as  unique.  Though  not  as  common  in  the  sale  of
chattels, specific performance may be granted in the event of a breach
by one who has agreed to sell a highly unusual chattel.

432

A is therefore incorrect. B is incorrect because the award of specific
performance  does  not  depend  on  whether  or  not  the  parties  to  the
sales  contract  are  merchants.  Since  a  seller  can  usually  resell  a
chattel upon the buyer's breach and recover as damages the difference
between the contract price and the resale price, specific performance
is not usually available to a seller. D is incorrect for this reason.

159. A Ordinarily, a party to a contract may assign its rights or delegate its
duties  to  another.  UCC  §2-210  provides,  however,  that  delegation
does  not  relieve  the  delegator  of  contract  duties  or  of  liability  for
breach.  Since  the  wholesaler  delegated  its  duties  to  the  new  owner,
and since the new owner breached those duties by failing to provide
assurances as required, the wholesaler (as well as the new owner) is
liable to the plaintiff for the breach.

An agreement to substitute the performance of a third person for that
of  the  obligor  accompanied  by  a  specific  agreement  to  release  the
obligor from its contractual duties is a “novation,” which relieves the
released  obligor  of  any  further  obligation.  The  plaintiff's  consent  to
the  wholesaler's  assignment/delegation  would  not  have  that  effect,
however,  because  the  plaintiff  did  not  specifically  agree  to  release
the  wholesaler.  B  and  C  are  incorrect  for  this  reason.  C  is  also
incorrect  because  UCC  §2-210  provides  that  a  party  who  demands
assurances  from  a  delegatee  does  not  thereby  prejudice  its  rights
against the original obligor. Although an assignment of rights implies
a delegation of duties, D is incorrect because the assignor/delegator
is secondarily liable upon breach by the delegatee.

160. A  An  accord  is  an  agreement  to  substitute  a  lesser  obligation  for  that
which existed under a contract. Like any other agreement, it does not
ordinarily  have  binding  effect  (i.e.,  does  not  discharge  the  original
contract obligation) unless supported by consideration. Consideration
usually  consists  of  some  legal  detriment  suffered  in  return  for  the
benefit  received.  The  benefit  received  by  the  homeowner  was  a
reduction in the price of the paint job. If the homeowner did not give
anything  in  return  (i.e.,  consideration)  for  this  reduction,  the
contractor  would  be  entitled  to  collect  the  balance  due.  If  the
homeowner did not reasonably believe that the contractor's work was
not  “satisfactory,”  he  was  not  entitled  to  seek  damages  under  the
contract  and  gave  up  nothing  in  return  for  the  reduction  in  price.
However, if he did reasonably believe that the contractor's work was

433

not “satisfactory,” he had a right to seek damages under the contract.
Here,  the  numerous  drips  and  missed  spots  likely  made  his  belief
reasonable. By giving up this right, he has given consideration for the
reduction in price. B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

161. A  If  a  buyer  accepts  defective  goods,  that  buyer  generally  can  sue  for
breach  of  warranty.  Here,  by  taking  the  cups  and  reselling  them,  the
home  design  store  accepted  the  goods.  Under  §2-714(2),  the  usual
damages  for  breach  of  warranty  are  the  “difference  at  the  time  and
place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the
value  they  would  have  had  if  they  had  been  as  warranted,  unless
special  circumstances  show  proximate  damages  of  a  different
amount.”  Consequently,  the  home  design  store  is  entitled  to  the
difference in value at the time of the shipment, or 50 cents times 1,000
($500). Although the drop in the stock market caused the home design
store to lose even more money when it resold the cups, this does not
affect the damage calculation. B and C are therefore incorrect. D  is
incorrect  because  the  manufacturer  sent  defective  goods,  and  the
buyer of defective goods is entitled to recover under the UCC.

162. C If the manufacturer had not breached his contract, the builder would
have  collected  $250,000,  from  which  he  would  have  had  to  pay  the
costs of completing the building. Since the damages remedy should be
designed  to  place  the  parties  in  the  positions  for  which  they
bargained, the builder should receive the contract price less the cost
of completing the building.

A is incorrect because the builder did not bargain for and should not
receive the benefit of a windfall resulting from increased construction
costs. B is incorrect because it fails to take into account the expenses
that  the  builder  would  have  had  in  earning  the  contract  price.  A
builder who commits a substantial breach may have no remedy other
than quasi-contract for the detriment that he or she has suffered. Since
the  builder  has  not  committed  a  breach,  however,  he  should  not  be
restricted to this remedy. D is therefore incorrect.

163. A An offer is a manifestation of present intent to be bound to specified
terms.  Since  the  seller's  letter  expresses  an  unequivocal  intention  to
sell the accordion to the second buyer for $2,000, it is an offer.

C is therefore incorrect. An acceptance is an agreement to be bound
to the terms of an offer. The seller's letter could not be an acceptance

434

unless the second buyer's letter was an offer. Since Baker's letter did
not  actually  say  that  he  would  pay  $2,000  (i.e.,  did  not  express  a
willingness  to  be  bound),  but  rather  asked  whether  the  seller  would
accept $2,000, it was not an offer, and the seller's response could not
have  been  an  acceptance.  B  is  therefore  incorrect.  Since  the  seller
never agreed to sell the accordion to the first buyer,  his  offer  to  the
second buyer could not be a repudiation of an agreement with the first
buyer. D is therefore incorrect.

164.  A  Under  UCC  §2-313,  a  warranty  is  made  by  any  description  of  the
goods that is given by the seller and which is part of the basis of the
bargain. The seller thus warranted that the beams delivered would be
steel. Under UCC §2-714, a buyer who has accepted nonconforming
goods  and  who  notifies  the  seller  of  the  nonconformity  within  a
reasonable time is entitled to damages. The measure of damages for
breach of warranty is fixed by UCC §2-714 as the difference between
the value that the delivered goods had at the time of acceptance and
the value that conforming goods would have had at that time.

B  is  incorrect  because  it  would  entitle  the  buyer  to  keep  the  beams
without  paying  anything  for  them.  C  is  incorrect  because  it  would
allow  the  seller  to  collect  the  price  of  steel  beams  although  he
delivered iron beams. Although the seller might have been better off
selling  the  beams  to  another  buyer  at  a  price  higher  than  they  were
worth, he has breached his warranty that the beams delivered would
be  steel  and  will  be  required  to  compensate  the  buyer  for  what  the
buyer has lost. D is therefore incorrect.

165.  A  Since  the  buyer  contracted  to  purchase  the  homeowner's  home,  his
failure  to  do  so  is  a  breach  that  entitles  the  homeowner  to  any
damages that result. A is therefore correct.

A  buyer  can  frequently  obtain  specific  performance  of  a  contract  to
sell  realty  because  the  uniqueness  of  a  given  parcel  of  realty  makes
money  damages  an  inadequate  remedy.  B  is  incorrect,  however,
because there is nothing unique about the money that the homeowner
was  to  receive  under  the  contract,  making  money  damages  an
adequate remedy for the seller. Consequently, C is incorrect as well.
Impossibility excuses performance only if the circumstance that made
performance  impossible  was  unforeseeable  at  the  time  the  contract
was formed. The subsequent illness of a party is usually regarded as
foreseeable, making D incorrect.

435

166.  D  An  assignment  is  a  transfer  of  a  right  to  receive  the  benefits  of  a
contract. If there was an enforceable agreement between the nephew
and the landowner, the nephew's promise to share some of the rights
that  he  received  under  that  contract  could  be  called  an  assignment.
Although  it  is  not  certain  that  the  nephew's  conversation  with  his
sister resulted in a valid assignment, A is the only answer that could
possibly be correct.

The difference between an assignee and a third-party beneficiary of a
contract is that an assignee's right is transferred to him or her after a
contract  has  been  created,  while  a  third-party  beneficiary's  right
(whether  an  intended  or  an  incidental  beneficiary)  is  created  by  the
contract  itself.  Since  the  agreement  between  the  nephew  and  the
landowner did not require either the nephew or the landowner to give
anything  to,  or  do  anything  for,  the  sister,  the  sister's  right  was  not
created by it. A, B, and C are therefore incorrect.

167.  A  Although  a  contract  is  not  usually  enforceable  except  by  one  in
privity,  a  third-party  beneficiary  may  enforce  it  if  the  parties  to  the
contract intended that it should benefit him or her. This is true whether
the  intended  third-party  beneficiary  is  a  creditor  beneficiary  or  a
donee  beneficiary.  A  creditor  beneficiary  is  one  whom  the  parties
intended to benefit to satisfy a preexisting obligation owed by one of
them.  The  neighbor  is  a  creditor  beneficiary  since  the  homeowner
made the contract to satisfy an obligation that he owed the neighbor.

A  donee  beneficiary  is  one  whom  a  contracting  party  intended  to
benefit  even  though  he  or  she  owed  him  or  her  no  obligation.  B  is
incorrect  since  the  homeowner  owed  the  man  an  obligation  under
their  previous  agreement.  An  incidental  beneficiary  is  one  who
derives  benefit  from  a  contract  not  made  with  the  intention  of
benefiting  him  or  her.  Thus,  C  is  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  since  the
man  was  an  intended  beneficiary  of  the  lawn  service  and  the
homeowner's contract.

168.  A  An  offer  is  an  expression  of  willingness  to  be  bound  to  specified
terms. Since both parties were aware of the price and terms set forth
in  the  buyer's  letter,  the  seller's  statement  could  be  construed  as  an
offer to sell the books to the buyer under those same terms.

B and C are incorrect because the buyer's letter of July 8 bound him
to purchase only if the books were delivered to his home, so nothing

436

but delivery could be regarded as acceptance. D is incorrect because
the performance required is delivery of the books, and the seller has,
by his statement, made no efforts toward such delivery.

169. C A condition is an event that must occur before the performance of a
contractual obligation is due. Because the builder could not build the
pool  until  the  homeowner  identified  where  it  should  be  built,  the
homeowner's failure to indicate the correct address could be seen as
a failure of the condition. Until necessary conditions are fulfilled, an
obligor is entitled to suspend performance. If it is too late to fulfill the
condition, the obligation is discharged. Here, since the contract called
for the pool to be completed before the homeowner returned home, it
was too late for the homeowner to fulfill the condition by identifying
the correct address and the builder's obligation was discharged.

The  standard  measure  of  damages  for  breach  of  a  contract  for
services  is  the  difference  between  the  contract  price  and  the  market
price.  Since  the  standard  price  was  10  percent  higher  than  the
contract  price,  the  homeowner  could  still  recover  the  difference
between the market price and the contract price. This is true whether
another  builder  was  willing  to  build  the  pool  for  the  same  price  or
not.  Consequently,  A  is  incorrect.  The  law  of  contracts  does  not
guarantee  a  profit.  B  is  incorrect  because  if  the  builder's  obligation
was  otherwise  enforceable,  the  fact  he  would  lose  money  does  not
relieve him of his obligation. D is incorrect because the fact he could
not  collect  payment  from  the  neighbor  is  irrelevant  to  the  contract
between the builder and the homeowner.

170.  C  The  standard  measure  for  damages  for  a  builder's  breach  of  a
construction contract is the difference between the contract price and
the owner's actual cost of completing the building as agreed. Here, the
original agreement was $200,000 for construction to be completed by
December 1. The second builder agreed to complete the building by
December 1 for $250,000. Consequently, the damages caused by the
breach of the contract were $50,000. Although the storeowner agreed
to pay an extra $25,000 if the work was completed sooner, this would
not be part of the standard calculation for damages. Consequently, B
and D are incorrect.

A  is  incorrect  because  although  the  project  ended  up  costing
$275,000 (which was the amount the first builder said he could do the
job for), this fact does not excuse the initial breach of contract.

437

171. D  The  standard  measure  for  damages  for  breach  of  a  sales  contract  is
the difference between the contract price and the fair market value on
the date performance was required.

It  is  generally  understood  that  a  non-breaching  party  has  a  duty  to
mitigate damages after a breach. This means that he or she cannot sit
by  and  watch  those  damages  increase  when  reasonable  conduct
would  have  prevented  damages  from  increasing.  Here,  the  seller's
failure  to  attempt  to  resell  the  building  has  done  nothing  to  increase
the damages he has suffered due to the breach of contract. Thus, A is
incorrect.  Although  unforeseeable 
that  make
performance  of  contractual  duties 
impossible  may  excuse
performance of a contract, the failure of the company's funding did not
make  the  purchase  of  the  office  building  impossible  (maybe
inconvenient or foolhardy, but not impossible). Thus, B is incorrect.
C  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  the  entrepreneur  informed  the  seller
prior to the date set for closing did not excuse the breach.

circumstances 

172.  A  UCC  §2-209  provides  that  the  modification  of  a  sales  contract  is
valid,  even  without  consideration.  The  engine  maker's  agreement  to
accept  $200  as  payment  in  full  is,  therefore,  enforceable  as  a
modification of the original contract.

B is incorrect because a modification need not be in writing unless,
as modified, the contract comes under the Statute of Frauds. Since the
modification  set  a  purchase  price  of  $200  (i.e.,  less  than  $500),  the
fact  that  it  was  not  written  does  not  affect  its  enforceability.  C  is
incorrect  because  UCC  §2-209  specifically  dispenses  with  the  need
for consideration. Duress is a compulsion or constraint that deprives
a party of the ability to exercise free will, and it generally involves
physical threats. Economic pressures do not constitute duress unless
the one exerting them brings about a desperate economic situation of
the  other  party.  Even  then,  most  jurisdictions  refuse  to  call  such
pressure duress. D is therefore incorrect.

173. C Under UCC §2-209, a modification of a contract is valid even though
unsupported by consideration. That same section provides, however,
that the Statute of Frauds applies to a contract which, as modified, is
within its provisions. Since the agreement made on April 15 between
the buyer and the farmer called for the purchase of 1,000 bushels at
the American Pear Exchange price as of May 1, and since that price
was  $2  per  bushel,  the  contract  called  for  the  sale  of  goods  with  a

438

price  of  $2,000.  Since  the  Statute  of  Frauds  applies  to  the  sale  of
goods  with  a  price  of  $500  or  more,  this  oral  contract  as  modified
falls  within  its  provisions,  and  is  therefore  unenforceable  over  the
objection of the buyer.

Although farmers are generally free to negotiate prices for the sale of
pears, the farmer is bound by the price that she already negotiated. A
is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  no
consideration is required for the modification of a contract under the
UCC, so the fact that each promise was consideration for the other is
irrelevant, and second, the Statute of Frauds requires this contract to
be in writing, whether it is supported by consideration or not. Since
liability  for  breach  of  contract  is  imposed  regardless  of  fault,  a
party's liability is not dependent on his or her ability to perform. D is
therefore incorrect.

174. C Under modern law, forbearance to assert a claim against another party
is consideration for the other party's promise to pay money if the party
who forbears reasonably believes his or her claim to be valid. Thus,
if the bar owner reasonably believed his claim for unpaid bar bills to
be valid (whether or not the student believed this), his forbearance to
assert that claim is valid consideration for the promise to pay that the
student made in his letter of September 3. Under these circumstances,
that promise would be enforceable.

A  unilateral  contract  is  one  in  which  a  party  exchanges  his  or  her
promise for the other party's act. An offer for a unilateral contract can
be accepted only by performing the act for which the offeror called.
Since the student's letter offered to pay if the bar owner would refrain
from  suing  him  (i.e.,  to  exchange  the  student's  promise  for  the  bar
owner's act of forbearance), it was an offer for a unilateral contract.
As  such,  it  could  be  accepted  only  by  the  bar  owner's  performance
(i.e., forbearance to sue). For this reason, the bar owner's failure to
respond  to  the  student's  letter  would  not  be  relevant  to  the  issue  of
whether  or  not  the  student's  offer  was  accepted.  A  is  therefore
incorrect. If the bar owner did not reasonably believe that the student
owed  him  $10,000,  he  suffered  no  legal  detriment  by  forbearing  to
assert a claim for that sum. His forbearance could not, therefore, be
consideration for the student's promise. The student's promise would
thus be unenforceable, and B is therefore incorrect. The bar owner's
claim is not based on the promise the student made when he incurred

439

the alleged bar bills, but on the promise that the student made in the
letter of September 3. If that promise is enforceable, it is independent
of  the  original  claim  for  unpaid  bar  bills.  For  this  reason,  the
enforceability  of  the  claim  for  unpaid  bar  bills  is  not  relevant.  D  is
therefore incorrect.

175. C In general, contract obligations are freely delegable unless the obligee
has a special interest in having the obligations performed personally
by  the  obligor.  It  is  usually  held  that  construction  contracts  are
delegable,  since  any  reputable  builder  can  construct  whatever  was
contracted  for  if  provided  with  the  proper  plans.  Since  a  moat  is
simply a hole in the ground, and since the earthmoving subcontractor
completed  the  moat  in  complete  conformity  with  the  landscaper's
plans, the landscaper's delegation of the digging work was probably
not a breach of contract.

A  is  therefore  incorrect.  B  is  incorrect  because  the  homeowner's
interest in having the job done by a well-known architect is probably
satisfied  by  the  fact  that  the  landscaper  designed  the  plan  and
executed most of the work himself, coupled with the fact that the moat
was  dug  in  complete  conformity  with  the  landscaper's  plan.  D  is
incorrect  for  two  reasons:  First,  contract  rights  are  not  freely
assignable  if  the  assignment  would  impose  an  additional  burden  on
the  assignor's  obligor,  and  second,  a 
transfer  of  contractual
obligations is a delegation, not an assignment.

176.  C  Since  the  doctor  did  not,  by  word  or  deed,  express  or  imply  a
willingness  to  pay  for  the  maintenance  of  the  neighbor's  lawn,  he  is
under no obligation to do so. (Note: It is generally understood that an
assignment  of  contract  rights  includes  a  delegation  of  contract
obligations.  Since  the  homeowner  assigned  to  the  doctor  his  rights
under the contract between the homeowner and the lawn service, the
lawn service would have been entitled to enforce against the doctor
any  rights  that  the  lawn  service  had  under  that  contract.  Since  the
homeowner  did  not  assign  to  the  doctor  any  rights  under  the
homeowner's  contract  with  the  neighbor  and  did  not  delegate  to  the
doctor any obligations under his contract with the neighbor, however,
the neighbor may not enforce those rights against the doctor.)

A  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  indication  that  the  neighbor  has
suffered any detriment as a result of reliance on the payments made by
the doctor to the lawn service. A covenant contained in the record of

440

title  to  realty  may  be  enforceable  against  subsequent  owners  of  the
realty  if  it  touches  and  concerns  the  land  involved.  B  is  incorrect,
however, because there is no indication that the homeowner's promise
was noted in the record of title to his realty. As has been noted above,
the  doctor  is  not  liable  to  the  neighbor  because  the  doctor  made  no
express  or  implied  promise  that  would  be  enforceable  by  the
neighbor. Although D correctly concludes that the doctor is not liable
to  the  neighbor,  it  suggests  that  the  reason  is  that  the  neighbor
sustained  no  damage.  This  is  incorrect,  however,  because  the
neighbor  is  now  paying  $25  per  month,  while  previously  he  was
paying nothing.

177. A An anticipatory repudiation is an unequivocal statement that he or she
will not perform made by a party before performance is due under a
contract. Upon a party's anticipatory repudiation, the other party has
an immediate right to sue for breach of contract. In general, all duties
under  a  contract  are  delegable  except  those  that  call  for  personal
services  or  special  skills.  Since  the  design  of  the  software  program
required special skills and knowledge, the specialist lacked the right
to delegate that duty to the dealer, and the specialist continued to be
under an obligation to perform. Her statement on August 16 was, thus,
an  anticipatory  repudiation,  giving  the  firm  an  immediate  right  of
action against her.

B is incorrect because an assignment of all rights under a contract is
generally understood to delegate all duties under that contract. Since
anticipatory  repudiation  results  in  an  immediate  right  of  action,  the
fact that performance is not yet due does not prevent a suit for breach
on  that  ground.  C  is  therefore  incorrect.  D  is  incorrect  because  the
duty  to  design  a  program  involved  personal  services  and  special
skills, so even though it was delegated by the specialist's sale to the
dealer, the delegation did not relieve the specialist of her duties under
the contract.

178. C Under UCC §2-201(1), a contract can be enforced against a party if
that party has sent the other party a memorandum. To be enforceable,
the  memorandum  has  to  be  a  “writing  sufficient  to  indicate  that  a
contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the
party  against  whom  enforcement  is  sought  .  .  .  A  writing  is  not
insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon
but  the  contract  is  not  enforceable  under  this  paragraph  beyond  the

http://barbeyond.taobao.com  QQ&Wechat: 1014347461  email: barbeyond@vip.qq.com  Skype ID: barbeyond

441

quantity of goods shown in the writing.” Nearly all courts have held
the absence of a price term does not make a memorandum insufficient.
Here, the music store's “confirmation” letter is sufficiently complete
to serve as a memorandum. However, since the letter says “5 guitars,”
the  factory  can  only  enforce  the  agreement  to  this  amount.  Thus,  the
factory is entitled to the profit it would make on selling five guitars,
or $250. Importantly, the facts state that the factory can make all of the
guitars  ordered  by  its  customers,  so  it  is  not  losing  anything  except
profits on this failed sale.

A, B, and D are, therefore, incorrect.

179. A In an assignment, the assignor transfers to an assignee the assignor's
right  to  receive  a  benefit  from  a  third  person.  Here,  the  company
promised  to  give  the  school  a  guitar,  and  the  school  transferred  its
right  to  receive  it  to  the  plaintiff  when  the  plaintiff  submitted  the
highest bid. Importantly, the company made a promise to the school to
donate  the  guitar.  That  promise  was  supported  in  one  of  two  ways.
Either  there  was  consideration  because  the  guitar  company  would
receive free publicity by donating the guitar, or there was detrimental
reliance because the school “sold” the guitar. Consequently, because
the school can enforce the guitar company's promise, the plaintiff can
also enforce the promise as the school's assignee.

B is incorrect because an intended third-party creditor beneficiary of
a contract is a third party to whom one of the contracting parties owed
a  preexisting  debt  and  to  whom  the  other  party  therefore  agreed  to
render  performance.  Here,  there  is  no  indication  the  school  owed  a
debt to anyone. C  is  incorrect  because  although  there  was  no  direct
agreement between the guitar company and the plaintiff, the plaintiff
can enforce the guitar company's promise to the school as an assignee.
D  is  incorrect  because  the  promise  was  likely  supported  by
consideration, as stated above.

180.  D  Under  the  doctrine  of  frustration  of  purpose,  a  party  may  be
discharged  from  a  contract  if  the  party's  purpose  is  completely  or
almost completely frustrated by events that destroy the party's purpose
in  entering  the  contract.  The  television  station  could  broadcast  the
advertisement, but since the music-streaming service's primary reason
for running the advertisement at that particular time was to reach the
musician's  audience  with  its  musician-themed  ad  and  exclusive
content, and since that purpose has been frustrated by the musician's

442

death,  the  music-streaming  service  will  be  discharged  from  the
contract. Importantly, the musician's death was an unforeseeable event
that  occurred  through  no  fault  of  the  music-streaming  service.
Consequently, B is incorrect.

A is incorrect because the understanding between the parties was that
the ad would run during the concert, and the doctrine of frustration of
purpose would still apply. C is incorrect because it is not impossible
for the ad to run, it is simply that the purpose for running the ad has
been  completely  frustrated  by  the  musician's  death  and  lack  of  the
televised concert.

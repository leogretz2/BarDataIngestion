Question 1701 - Civil Procedure - Appealability and Review (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A citizen brought suit in federal court, alleging that a police officer violated her Fourth Amendment rights. The citizen
asserts that the officer illegally entered her home, conducted an unlawful search, and wrongfully seized her property.
The case went to trial and the verdict was for the citizen on her unlawful search and wrongful seizure of property
claims but for the police officer on the illegal entry claim. Judgment was entered on the verdict. Each side timely
appealed.  

 In the trial court, the citizen never made a motion for judgment as a matter of law on her illegal entry claim, but on
appeal she argued that she should have won the illegal entry claim, as a matter of law. Although, in the trial court, the
citizen failed to file motion for judgment as a matter of law on her illegal entry claim, she did timely object to the court's
admission of some evidence relevant to that same claim and to a jury instruction that the district court gave as to that
same claim.  

 When addressing the citizen's timely filed appeal, may the appellate court entertain the citizen's assignments of error
with respect to the admission of evidence and the jury instruction to which the citizen objected and reverse the
judgment against the citizen on her illegal entry claim and find the trial court erred in these decisions?  

A: No, any errors in the admission of evidence or in the challenged jury instruction were rendered harmless in view of
the citizen's waiver of her argument for judgment as a matter of law. 
B: No, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction over these alleged errors. 
C: Yes, the citizen's waiver of her argument for judgment as a matter of law on the illegal entry claim leaves her free
to argue that the verdict should be vacated and the judgment reversed because of the errors that the citizen has
identified in the admission of evidence and in the jury instructions, and the appeals court may reverse the judgment
against the citizen on her illegal entry claim if it finds prejudicial error in these trial court decisions. 
D: While the appellate court may entertain the citizen's assignments of error with respect to the admission of evidence
and the jury instruction to which the citizen objected, it may not reverse the judgment unless the court finds that the
trial court committed "plain error" in these decisions. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The assigned errors were not rendered harmless in view of the citizen's waiver of her argument for
judgment as a matter of law. Even if the illegal entry claim properly went to the jury, errors in the admission of
evidence and in jury instructions can be prejudicial errors that entitle a plaintiff to relief from the judgment (and
presumably to a new trial).  

 B is incorrect. The appellate court does not lack jurisdiction over the alleged errors. On timely appeal from final
judgment, the court has jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory orders that are merged in that judgment, as these
orders would be, and the question states that plaintiff timely objected to the evidence and the jury instruction in
question.  

 C is correct. Because the citizen waived her argument for judgment as a matter of law, the citizen can now argue that
the trial court's verdict be reversed as a result of the errors that the citizen asserts the trial court committed with
respect to the admission of evidence and in the jury instructions. The appellate court has jurisdiction over these errors
and may reverse the trial court's decision if it finds prejudicial error in the trial court's decision.  

 D is incorrect because "plain error" is the standard of review that applies to matters, jury instructions in particular, that
the appellant did not timely or properly complain about in the district court; that is not the situation here.

Question 1790 - Civil Procedure - Appealability and Review (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

Recipients of fax advertisements sued a management company in federal court under the federal Telephone
Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), alleging that the company sent unsolicited junk fax ads in violation of the TCPA.
The district court certified a class action, defining the class as the recipients of the unsolicited junk faxes sent by the
management company. The management company sought leave to immediately appeal the order certifying the class,
arguing that the potential damages were so great in relation to the management company's assets that, if the class
certification order stood, the management company would be forced to settle, even though it has a strong case on the
merits. The management company did not include in the record any information about its assets, nor did it
demonstrate a significant probability that the class certification was erroneous in its appeal.  

 Should the appellate court grant the petition for leave to appeal?  

A: Yes, in order to protect the management company from being forced to agree to a catastrophic settlement when it
has a strong case on the merits. 
B: Yes, because petitions for leave to appeal from a class certification were created to give appellate courts the
opportunity to review class certification decisions that otherwise might forever escape appellate scrutiny due to the
likelihood that such suits often settle. 
C: No, because the management company made no evidentiary showing of its assets or that the potential damages
were so great that, in light of those limited assets, the management company would feel compelled to settle if the
class certification stood. 
D: No, because the management company did not make a showing that the certification order was erroneous, there is
no question of law to be decided.  

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Even though some appellate courts are inclined to grant a petition for leave to appeal from a class
certification to protect a defendant from being forced to settle (even if it has a strong case on the merits), to avoid the
risk of a catastrophic judgment, appellate courts will not do so absent an evidentiary showing that supports the
argument.  

 B is incorrect. Even though the general proposition concerning the motivation to grant a petition for leave to appeal
from a class certification were created to give appellate courts the opportunity to review class certification decisions
that otherwise might forever escape appellate scrutiny, that does not provide adequate reason to grant this type of
petition. More is required.  

 C is incorrect. Although the information in C is correct, it alone is not enough. The decision to grant an appeal of this
kind is discretionary. D is a better answer here because the management company failed to demonstrate that the
class certification order was erroneous.  

 D is correct. Here, the management company should provide evidence that both the class certification was erroneous
and that the management company would be subjected to great pressure to settle in light of the potential damages.
The question does not reveal any other reason for granting the appeal, such as the appeal raising an important
question of law, a decision of which by the appellate court would be beneficial to other persons.

Question 1795 - Civil Procedure - Appealability and Review (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A man filed suit against a captain in state court for negligence and for allegedly violating federal employment law. The
man's suit was then removed to federal court. While the suit was pending in federal court, the federal court held the
man in civil contempt for violating a protective order that had been enacted as a safeguard against the reveal of
confidential information. Following this, the federal court dismissed the federal employment law claim against the
captain and remanded the negligence claim to state court from which the claims were initially removed from. The man
then filed a notice of appeal from the district court's civil contempt order in the federal appellate court located in the
same territory as the district court. The captain then moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  

 Should the appellate court grant the captain's motion to dismiss?  

A: No, because the remand is a final order, giving the appellate court jurisdiction over previously entered interlocutory
orders including the civil contempt citation. 
B: Yes, because the remand is not a final decision and no other basis for appellate jurisdiction over the civil contempt
citation exists. 
C: Yes, because the remand order is not reviewable on appeal since the federal appeals court lacks authority to
review the remand and lacks authority to review interlocutory orders that the district court entered before it remanded
the case to state court. 
D: No, because civil contempt citations are immediately appealable. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is correct. Firstly, remand is considered a final order because it effectively puts the litigants out of court with the
district court distancing itself from the case entirely by surrendering jurisdiction. Secondly, although the general rule is
that remand orders cannot be appealed because the appellate court lacks jurisdiction, there are exceptions. Remand
orders that are based on a defect in the removal procedure or a lack of federal jurisdiction cannot be appealed.
However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the discretionary choice of a district court not to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction is not a remand based on lack of jurisdiction but rather a remand based on discretion. In this case, the
state law claims came into federal court through supplemental jurisdiction attached to the federal claims. Once the
federal claims were dismissed, the court had the discretion to keep the supplemental claims or remand them back to
state court. Because the remand was discretionary, the Supreme Court has held that such remands may be reviewed
on appeal for abuse of discretion.  

 B is incorrect. In this case, the district court's remand of the man's state claims is regarded as a final decision
regarding the man's civil contempt order under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 since it puts the case out of federal court. Therefore,
the appellate court does have jurisdiction over the man's claim.  

 C incorrect. An order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed typically is not reviewable on
appeal. However, 28 U.S.C. § 2-314 1447(d) does not preclude the appeal of discretionary remands such as this; it
precludes review of remands for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for defects in removal procedure. See Carlsbad
Tech., Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc., 129 S.Ct. 1862 (2009).  

 D is incorrect. Civil contempt citations are not immediately appealable – criminal contempt citations are. Further, if the
civil contempt citation had been immediately appealable, this appeal would be untimely and hence beyond the
jurisdiction of the appellate court.

Question 1798 - Civil Procedure - Appealability and Review (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

Residents of a foreign country, Country A, brought suit against an American energy corporation in federal district
court. The residents asserted violations of a federal act based on human rights abuses committed in Country A by
Country A military personnel who had been hired by the American energy corporation. The district court found for the
energy corporation, and the residents of Country A appealed. On appeal after the final judgment, the energy
corporation argued for the first time that under the federal act, a corporation cannot be held liable. The residents of
Country A argued that the court of appeals should not address this new argument.  

 May the federal court of appeals consider the newly raised argument from the energy corporation?  

A: No, it is beyond the jurisdiction of the federal court of appeals to decide issues that were not presented to and
decided by the district court.  
B: No, the federal court of appeals may not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal so as not to usurp
the proper function of the trial court or encourage parties to withhold arguments which should be heard by the trial
court. 
C: Yes, despite the general reluctance of the federal court of appeals to consider issues that were not presented to
the district court, the appellate courts do have discretion to hear such issues. 
D: No, despite the discretion of the federal court of appeals to hear issues raised for the first time on appeal, there is
not an adequate factual record for the court to review this particular issue. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Federal appellate courts (and the Supreme Court) have held that appellate courts do have jurisdiction to
decide issues that were not presented to the district court.  

 B is incorrect. Although the policy arguments made in B frequently prevail, they do not always do so. Whether to
entertain issues raised for the first time on appeal is regarded as within the court's discretion. Appellate courts
frequently will hear new issues when they are issues of law as to which either no factual record is required or the
factual record already made is adequate.  

 C is correct. Here, the appellate court may consider the energy corporation's new argument because the energy
corporation has raised a question of law and the residents of Country A will not be prejudiced by this argument since
they will have an adequate opportunity to argue this issue to the court of appeals.  

 D is incorrect. In this case, the kind of facts that would be pertinent (legislative history, e.g.) could be brought in
through the parties' briefs; no factual record would be required or appropriate. Hence, C is a better answer than D.

Question 1792 - Civil Procedure - Appealability and Review (2/9/2017) 

The question was: 

A commercial landlord sued his former tenant in federal court, asserting that the tenant did substantial damage to the
leased premises resulting in $80,000 worth of damages. The landlord also asserted a claim for slander due to
allegedly defamatory remarks that the tenant made to prospective future tenants. The tenant counterclaimed for
slander, alleging the landlord made it difficult for the tenant to find a suitable new location for its operations. The
tenant also sought recovery of its security deposit. After discovery, the landlord and the tenant filed cross-motions for
summary judgment on the damage to the premises and security deposit claims. The court granted summary judgment
in the landlord's favor on both claims. The parties' respective claims for slander were set for trial. The landlord asked
the district court to immediately enter a final judgment as to the damages and security deposit claims so the landlord
could immediately collect the money due. The tenant opposed this request, providing evidence of the hardship she
would suffer if she had to pay the full amount of the damages now when that amount might be reduced by the
decisions on the respective claims for slander.  

 Should the court grant the landlord's motion for a partial final judgment?  

A: Yes, because the claims at issue have been fully heard and resolved on the merits.  
B: No, because the tenant made a showing of hardship coupled with the potential of the undue burden the appellate
court would face if it had to hear the case twice.  
C: No, because final judgment cannot be entered until all of the claims in a case have been fully adjudicated. 
D: Yes, because there is no just reason to delay the entry of a final judgment. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Although the court may enter a partial final judgment when there has been sufficient facts to resolve an
issue and the parties have been fully heard on the issue, it is within the judge's discretion to do so.  

 B is correct. The court here has several reasons to justify delaying entry of a partial judgment in this case, including
the possibility that the tenant may win damages on her slander claim against the landlord, thereby reducing the
amount of her liability, the tenant’s showing of hardship, and the potential for undue burden on the appellate court if it
had to consider this case twice. As a matter of policy courts dislike piecemeal appeals and will not enter partial
judgments if it seems likely that a piecemeal appeal could occur.  

  C is incorrect. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) permits a court to enter a final judgment on fewer than all of the
claims when a court expressly determines that there is no justifiable reason to delay entering the judgment.  

 D is incorrect because there are several reasons for the court to delay the judgment.

Question 1791 - Civil Procedure - Appealability and Review (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A painter brought suit against an art gallery in federal court. During the trial, the district court held that the art gallery
had waived its attorney-client privilege and therefore ordered the art gallery to produce documents as to which it
claimed the privilege. The court declined to certify its order for interlocutory appeal, so the art gallery timely filed a
notice of appeal, arguing that the production order was immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.  

 Should the court of appeals entertain the appeal pursuant to that doctrine?  

A: No, because the issue of attorney-client privilege cannot be separated from the merits of the case.  
B: No, because the issue may be dealt with on an appeal after the final judgment.  
C: Yes, because the issue of attorney-client privilege can be separated out from the merits of the case.  
D: Yes, because the issue would be effectively unreviewable on an appeal after the final judgment. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

The collateral order doctrine is a narrow exception to the finality requirement for appeals. Typically only final order are
reviewable by the appellate court, however under this doctrine a claim or issue may be immediately appealable if it is
too important to wait. There are three requirements: (1) the lower court must have conclusively determined the
disputed question; (2) the issue must be separate from and collateral to the merits of the main issue of the case; and
(3) the issue must be effectively unreviewable on an appeal from the final judgment.  

 A is incorrect. Here the issue of attorney-client privilege relates to documents being produced during discovery and
has nothing to do with the merits of the main legal claims of the case. Therefore the issue would be a collateral issue,
easily separated from the merits of the case.  

 B is correct. The issue does not merit an appeal because it does not meet the third requirement of the test: that the
issue must be effectively unreviewable on an appeal after the final judgment. The doctrine is meant to be used only for
extreme cases, and so far has only been applied to cases involving matters of immunity and double jeopardy, where
there exists such a right so as not to even stand trial. Here the defendant has other adequate means of vindicating its
rights such as by refusing to comply with the production order, suffering sanctions for so doing, and appealing from
the imposition of those sanctions, after final judgment.  

 C is incorrect. Even though, as stated above, the issue may be easily be separated, to merit an appeal all three
requirements of the test must be met.  

 D is incorrect based on the reasoning stated above.

Question 1787 - Civil Procedure - Appealability and Review (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

Owners of a trademark brought suit in federal district court, alleging that an electronic company was infringing its
trademark and engaging in unfair competition. The owners sought a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction
against the electronic company to preclude it from continuing to infringe the owners' trademark, and also sought
money damages. The electric company denied the allegations in the complaint. Sometime thereafter, the owners
moved for summary judgment requesting a permanent injunction on the electric company and money damages. The
district court denied the owners' motion. The owners timely appealed, contending that the denial of summary judgment
constituted an interlocutory order refusing an injunction.  

 Does the appellate court have jurisdiction over the appeal?  

A: Yes, because the district court did refuse an injunction when it denied the owners' motion for summary judgment,
and its decision was an interlocutory order, as the case will continue. 
B: No, because in an interlocutory order, a district court can rule only on a request for a preliminary injunction, and
such an injunction was neither requested nor ruled on; a district court can rule upon a request for a permanent
injunction only at the conclusion of a case. 
C: No, because the denial of summary judgment did not refuse the owners' request for an injunction on the merits; the
denial could not yet decide whether the requested injunction should issue. 
D: No, because the denial of summary judgment also rejected the owners' request for money damages, at least
temporarily, and no statutory authorization exists for interlocutory appeal of decisions that simultaneously deny both
monetary and injunctive relief. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Here, the appellate court should hold that it does not have jurisdiction over the appeal because the
denial of summary judgment did not refuse the owners' request for an injunction on the merits.  

 B is incorrect. An interlocutory order may deny a permanent injunction.  

 C is correct. Here, an appellate court would not have jurisdiction over the appeal because the district court's denial of
the owners' motion for summary judgment did not refuse the owners' request for an injunction on the merits, and the
denial could not yet decide whether the requested injunction should issue. See Switzerland Cheese Ass'n. v. E.
Horne's Market, Inc., 385 U.S. 23 (1966).  

 D is incorrect. There is no need for a statutory authorization for interlocutory appeal of decisions that simultaneously
deny both monetary and injunctive relief. § 2-314 1292(a)(1) authorizes the interlocutory denial of an injunction and
may be utilized as to the injunction denial even when an order also has the effect of temporarily denying monetary
relief.

Question 1800 - Civil Procedure - Appealability and Review (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A citizen brought suit in federal court against a police officer alleging that the officer violated her Fourth Amendment
rights. The citizen alleged that the officer illegally entered her home, conducted an unlawful search, and wrongfully
seized her property. The case went to trial and a verdict on the unlawful search and wrongful seizure of property
claims was returned in favor of the citizen.  A verdict for the illegal entry claim was returned in favor of the police
officer. Judgment was entered accordingly. Each side timely appealed. In the trial court, the citizen never made a
motion for judgment as a matter of law on her illegal entry claim, but on appeal she argued that she should have won
the illegal entry claim as a matter of law.  

 How should the court of appeals respond to the citizen's argument?  

A: The court should entertain the argument and grant the citizen a judgment as a matter of law on her illegal entry
claim if no reasonable jury could have rendered a verdict for the police officer on that claim. 
B: The court should refuse to consider the citizen's argument on the ground that federal statutory law denies
jurisdiction to the federal appeals courts to entertain post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law. 
C: The court should refuse to consider the citizen's argument on the ground that appellate courts are not permitted to
consider motions for judgment as a matter of law for the first time on appeal. 
D: The court should entertain the citizen's argument but deny the citizen's judgment as a matter of law on her illegal
entry claim as the appellate court has no authority to deprive a party of the benefit of a jury verdict in its favor. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Appellate courts do not directly review the actions of juries; they review a trial judge's assessment of the
work of the jury through a motion for judgment as a matter of law. Motions for judgment as a matter of law require
parties to make such a motion before a claim goes to the jury and to renew the motion after the verdict. See Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 50.  

 B is incorrect because there is no statute that restricts the jurisdiction of the federal appeals courts as described in B.  

 C is correct. Motions for judgment as a matter of law require parties to make such a motion before a claim goes to the
jury and to renew the motion after the verdict. Therefore, a party may not raise a motion as a matter of law for the first
time on appeal.  

 D is incorrect. First, the federal appellate courts do not directly review the actions of juries. Second, it is untrue that
federal appellate courts have no authority to deprive a party of the benefit of a jury verdict in its favor. In appropriate
circumstances, federal appellate courts may do just that.

Question 1616 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

An art collector in State A recently had a painting from his home appraised for $50,000.00. The art collector believes
he is the rightful owner of the painting; however, each of his two cousins, a historian from State B, and a teacher from
State C, also claim rightful ownership of the painting. The art collector would like to resolve, once and for all, who is
the true owner of the painting. Neither the historian nor the teacher has ever traveled outside the state where each
presently live.  

 Which of the following is true regarding the art collector's ability to bring suit against the historian and teacher in
federal court under the federal interpleader statute?  

A: The art collector can bring an interpleader action against only the historian in State B and that court's decision will
also be binding on the teacher. 
B: The art collector can bring an interpleader action against the historian and the teacher in federal court in State A,
even if State A's state court would not have had personal jurisdiction over the historian or the teacher under State A's
long-arm statute. 
C: The art collector would have been able to bring an interpleader action in federal court in State A against the
historian or the teacher if the painting had been appraised at more than $75,000. 
D: The art collector can bring an interpleader action against the historian and the teacher in federal court in State A,
but only if a State A state court would have had personal jurisdiction over the historian and teacher under State A's
long-arm statute. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The court's interpleader judgment will be binding only on those who have been made a party to the
action. Therefore, if the art collector obtains a judgment against the historian, that decision will not also be binding on
the teacher.  

 B is correct. Interpleader permits a person in the position of a stakeholder to require two or more claimants to litigate
among themselves to determine which, if any, has the valid claim where separate actions might result in double
liability on a single obligation. Interpleader is the appropriate way for the art collector to bring his suit against both
cousins at the same time. Additionally, interpleader is available under Fed. R. Civ. P. 22 or under the Federal
Interpleader Statute (28 U.S.C. 1335). Under the Rules, complete diversity is required. However, under the statute,
only minimal diversity is required: an amount in controversy of $500 or more and diversity between any two
contending claimants.  

 C is incorrect. Under the federal interpleader statute there is jurisdiction so long as at least $500 is in dispute and
there is minimal diversity among the claimants. This is unlike Fed. R. Civ. P. 22, which relies upon the normal rules of
subject matter jurisdiction.  

 D is incorrect. The interpleader statute allows for nationwide service of process.

Question 1606 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (6/20/2016) 

The question was: 

A pedestrian from State A sues a motorcyclist from State B in a State A court, seeking $100,000 compensation for
tortious injuries caused by the motorcyclist's allegedly negligent acts in State A. The motorcyclist then files a notice of
removal in the federal court for the Eastern District of State A.  

 Which objection by the pedestrian would be legally valid?  

A: Venue is incorrect if the accident occurred in the Western District of State A. 
B: Venue is incorrect if the state court in which the original lawsuit was filed was located in the Western District of
State A. 
C: Venue is incorrect if the motorcyclist resides in the Western District of State A. 
D: Venue is incorrect if the original lawsuit was filed in the wrong venue under state law. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

The correct answer is B. The federal removal statute specifies that any civil action brought in a state court may be
removed by the defendant to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place
where such action is pending. If the state court where the action was originally filled was located in the Western
District of State A, then removal would be proper to the Western District of State A, not the Eastern District of State A.  

 Answer A is incorrect because this is one of the venue criteria for suits originally filed in federal court. The federal
removal statute specifies that removal from a state court is to be made to the judicial district which embraces the court
where the state action is pending.  

 Answer C is incorrect because this is also one of the venue criteria for suits originally filed in federal court. The
federal removal statute specifies that removal from a state court is to be made to the judicial district which embraces
the court where the state action is pending.  

 Answer D is incorrect because this is an argument that should have been made in state court before a notice of
removal is filed. This is not an appropriate argument for the federal court to hear. 












Page 11

Question 1711 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (6/26/2016) 

The question was: 

A former employee sued a corporation, her former employer, in State A state court, alleging that she was illegally fired
for making a workers' compensation claim. The employee was a citizen of State B, the corporation was incorporated
in State C, had its principal manufacturing plant in State B and its second largest plant in State A, and was run by its
board of directors from State D. Plaintiff sought in excess of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs. Under State A
workers' compensation law, as interpreted by the State A courts, this is a claim "arising under" State A workers'
compensation law. The corporation removed the case to State A federal court, invoking diversity jurisdiction. Within 30
days after the filing of the notice of removal, the employee moved to remand back to state court.  

 How should the court rule on the motion?  

A: The court should deny the motion to remand because the court has diversity jurisdiction over the case. 
B: The court should grant the motion to remand because the court lacks diversity jurisdiction over the case. 
C: The court should grant the motion to remand because workers' compensation suits arising under the laws of the
state in which the action was filed may not be removed to federal court, notwithstanding the existence of diversity
jurisdiction over the suit. 
D: The court should deny the motion to remand because the motion was filed too late. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Pursuant to  § 1445(c), a civil action in any State court arising under the workers' compensation laws of
such State may not be removed to any district court of the United States. Therefore, it does not suffice that the federal
court has diversity jurisdiction over the suit and the court should grant the motion to remand.  

 B is incorrect. Diversity jurisdiction for removal is determined on the date of the removal. On the date of the removal,
the employee was a citizen of State B, the corporation was a citizen of State C and State D, and the employee sought
compensation in excess of $75,000. Therefore, because the parties were diverse when the action was removed, there
is diversity jurisdiction.  

 C is correct. Pursuant to § 1445(c), a civil action in any State court arising under the workers' compensation laws of
such State may not be removed to any district court of the United States, notwithstanding the existence of diversity
jurisdiction over the suit. Thus, the court should grant the motion to remand.  

 D is incorrect. A plaintiff must file a motion for remand 30 days after notice of the removal. Here the journalist timely
filed a motion to remand.

Question 1703 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (6/27/2016) 

The question was: 

A patient brought a negligence action in federal district court in State A against a dentist and a nurse following a root
canal procedure the dentist and nurse performed. The patient sought more than $75,000 in compensatory damages
from both the dentist and the nurse. The patient is a citizen of State A; the dentist is a citizen of State B; and the nurse
is a citizen of State A. The nurse then moved to dismiss the case for lack of complete diversity between the parties. In
opposition, the patient argued that the court can assert supplemental jurisdiction over her claim against the nurse.  

 Should the district court grant the nurse's motion to dismiss?  

A: No; the district court should deny the motion to dismiss because the patient's claim against the dentist is a civil
action within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts and the court can assert supplemental jurisdiction over the
claim against the nurse because it is part of the same case or controversy as the patient's claim against the dentist. 
B: Yes; the district court should grant the nurse's motion to dismiss because even though the patient's claim against
the dentist is a civil action within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts, the court does not have supplemental
jurisdiction over the claim against the nurse because it does not arise from the same case or controversy as the claim
against the dentist. 
C: Yes; the district court should grant the nurse's motion to dismiss because there is no diversity between the parties
and therefore the court lacks diversity jurisdiction. 
D: No; the district court should deny the motion to dismiss because the patient's claim against the dentist is a civil
action within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts and the judicial economy would be served by litigating the
patient's claims against the dentist and the nurse together. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The court lacks the power to grant supplemental jurisdiction over the patient's claim against the nurse
because doing so would destroy complete diversity.  

 B is incorrect. Here, the patient brought suit against the dentist and the nurse following a root canal procedure that
the dentist and nurse had performed. As such, the injured woman's claim against the nurse does arise out of the same
case against the dentist.  

 C is correct. The nurse's presence in the claim prohibits the court from having diversity jurisdiction over the patient's
claims against the dentist and the nurse. A plaintiff, generally, cannot use supplemental jurisdiction to overcome a lack
of diversity in a diversity case.  

 D is incorrect. An interests in judicial economy cannot justify the exercise of jurisdiction over a set of claims that does
not satisfy a grant of jurisdiction.

Question 1713 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

The rules of the courts of State X prohibit personal injury plaintiffs from alleging, in their complaints, the amount of
damages they seek. A janitor from State X brought suit in state court in State X against a mechanic from State A for
negligence. As alleged in the complaint, the janitor suffered multiple broken bones which required extensive surgeries
and suffered from brain damage. The janitor sought compensation for those injuries for pain and suffering and
reimbursement of medical expenses. The parties sought and received discovery from one another for over a year. A
year after the janitor filed his action, the mechanic received timely answers to interrogatories that, for the first time,
expressly indicated that the janitor sought $1 million in damages. The mechanic promptly filed with the local federal
district court a notice of removal citing that the janitor's interrogatory answer stated that the janitor sought $1 million in
damages. The janitor moved to remand the action.  

 Should the court grant the motion to remand?  

A: No; the court should deny the motion to remand because the federal court has diversity jurisdiction and the
removal was timely because the mechanic filed its notice of removal promptly after ascertaining from the janitor's
interrogatory answers that the janitor sought $1 million in damages. 
B: Yes; the court should grant the motion to remand because the mechanic's removal was untimely. 
C: No; the court should deny the motion to remand because even though the removal was effected more than a year
after the commencement of the action, the janitor deliberately failed to disclose the amount in controversy to prevent
the mechanic from removing the case to federal court. 
D: Yes; the court should grant the motion to remand because the mechanic failed to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The mechanic should have been able to determine from the nature of janitor's injuries, as described in
the complaint, that the jurisdictional amount was in controversy. Therefore, the interrogatory answers did not first put
the mechanic on notice that the jurisdictional amount was in controversy. Thus, the removal is untimely both in the
sense that it was effected more than 30 days after receipt of the complaint and in that it was effected more than a year
after commencement of the action.  

 B is correct. The mechanic should have been able to determine from the nature of janitor's injuries, as described in
the complaint, that the jurisdictional amount was in controversy. Thus, the removal is untimely both in the sense that it
was effected more than 30 days after receipt of the complaint and in that it was effected more than a year after
commencement of the action.  

 C is incorrect. The janitor did not deliberately fail to disclose the amount in controversy to prevent removal. State
court rules precluded the janitor from pleading the amount in controversy and nothing prevented the mechanic from
posing interrogatories to the janitor sooner, the answers to which would have disclosed how much the janitor was
seeking.  

 D is incorrect. The mechanic did not fail to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy
exceeded $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs; the problem is that the removal came too late.

Question 1719 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

In a hurry to get his case on file before the statute of limitations ran on his claim, a pilot from State A filed suit against
a radiologist from State C in the federal judicial district in State A, an extremely busy court. The radiologist does not
reside in State A and a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim did not occur in State A. The radiologist
moved to transfer the case to State B because he travels to State B often for work. The pilot happened to have family
in State B, so he consented to the transfer there. It remains up to the court in State A to decide whether to transfer the
case at all, and whether to transfer it to the federal court in State B, in particular.  

 How should the court rule on the motion to transfer?  

A: The court should grant the motion to transfer to State B because both of the parties have expressed their consent
to litigating the case in State B and transfers are permitted when all parties have consented. 
B: The court should grant the motion because the combination of the parties' consent and the extremely busy docket
of the federal court in State A combine to justify the transfer. 
C: The court should deny the motion because State B is not a district in which the action could have properly been
brought originally. 
D: The court should deny the motion because transfer is permitted only from one proper venue to another, for the
convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect.  Here, the case was initially filed in an improper venue.  When a case is filed in an improper venue
courts must either dismiss the case or transfer the case to a venue where the case could have initially been brought.
Transfers where the original venue is improper is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1406, not 28 U.S.C. § 1404, and the
former (unlike the latter) does not authorize transfer to a district to which all parties have consented.  

 B is incorrect.  Here, because the case was initially filed in an improper venue, the parties cannot simply consent to
transfer the case to a different jurisdiction.  Moreover, the court may not transfer the case to State B because State B
is not a court in which the action could have initially been brought.  As such, neither the parties consent nor the busy
docket of State A's federal court justifies the court to transfer the case to State B.  

 C correct.  Here, the court should deny the motion because State B is not a district in which the action could have
initially been brought.  When parties file suit in an improper venue, a court must either dismiss the case or transfer the
case to a venue where the action could have initially been brought.  Here, nothing indicates that the court in State B
would be a proper venue.  Therefore, the court must deny the motion to transfer.  

 D is incorrect.  Transfer is not permitted only from one proper venue to another for convenience, it also is permitted
as an alternative to dismissal for improper venue.

Question 1619 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A horse jockey from State A filed suit against an animal trainer from State B in federal court in State B seeking
$80,000 as compensation for damages to his race horse as a result of the trainer's alleged negligence. The horse
jockey mailed to the trainer a request for waiver of service, two copies of the waiver form, and a copy of the horse
jockey's complaint.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The trainer may waive service but would not be penalized for failing to do so even absent a showing of good cause
for failure to waive. 
B: The trainer should do nothing because there is no procedure to properly waive service.  
C: The trainer must waive service or will face penalties from the court absent a showing of good cause for failure to
waive. 
D: State law determines whether waiver is permissible since this is a diversity action. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The failure to waive service without good cause will result in costs being imposed on the defendant,
including the costs of service and reasonable expenses. Here, absent a showing of good cause, the trainer can be
penalized for failing to waive service.  

 B is incorrect. Fed. R .Civ. P. 4(d) specifically provides for waiver of service.  

 C is correct. The plaintiff may request the defendant to waive service of process. To request a waiver of service, the
plaintiff must mail the defendant a formal request to waive service, two copies of the waiver form, and a copy of the
complaint. The defendant has 30 days from the date that the request was sent to return the waiver. If the defendant
does not waive service of process, the plaintiff must serve him using one of the other approved methods (e.g.,
personal service, service at the defendant's usual abode, service upon an authorized agent, or service under a state
approved method). However, the defendant will be liable for the cost of such additional service if he does not have
good cause for failing to waiver service. Here, the horse jockey followed the correct protocol for waiver of service.
Therefore, absent a showing of good cause, the trainer must waive service or face the court imposed penalties, such
as costs of the additional service methods.  

 Answer D is incorrect. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d) provides the applicable service rules in all federal lawsuits.

Question 1620 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A chef from State A sues a butcher from State B in a federal court in State A, seeking $100,000 compensation for
tortious injuries caused in a car accident by the butcher's allegedly negligent driving while he was in State A. Apart
from the single day of the car accident, the butcher has not spent any time in State A, and the butcher does not want
to litigate there.  

 What course of action may the butcher's lawyer take?  

A: File a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the butcher does not have minimum contacts
with State A. 
B: File a motion to transfer the case to State B federal court to cure a defect in personal jurisdiction. 
C: File a motion to transfer venue due to the burden that would be imposed on the butcher if he were required to
litigate in State A. 
D: File a notice of removal in the federal district court of State B where the butcher resides. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Minimum contacts is relevant to personal jurisdiction, not subject-matter jurisdiction. Further, there
unquestionably are minimum contacts on these facts since the accident occurred in State A. There is also subject-
matter jurisdiction through diversity jurisdiction.  

 B is incorrect. As stated above, State A will have personal jurisdiction over the butcher because the accident occurred
in State A.  

 C is correct. For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any
civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought. Because the suit was originally brought in
a proper venue, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court may transfer the case by discretion. It is the
movant's burden to show how and why another venue would be more proper.  

 D is incorrect. Removal is a mechanism by which a defendant may move a case from state court to federal court.
Here, the case is already in federal court. The proper mechanism to move the case would be a motion to transfer
venue. 












Page 17

Question 1603 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A teacher, a citizen of State A, brought suit against a librarian, a citizen of State B, in a state court in State A. The
teacher seeks $100,000 as compensation for tortious injuries allegedly caused by the librarian's negligent acts in
State A. The librarian files a notice of removal in the federal district court of State B. The teacher files a timely motion
to remand.  

 How should the federal judge rule on the motion to remand?  

A: Remand because the court does not have personal jurisdiction. 
B: Deny because the federal court has diversity jurisdiction over the parties and the original lawsuit was not filed in
State B. 
C: Remand because the original lawsuit was filed in State A. 
D: Deny because the original lawsuit was filed in the state in which the teacher was a citizen and the librarian was not. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The removal statute calls for analysis of subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction. Challenges
to personal jurisdiction are properly made in the state court in which the suit was originally filed.  

 B is incorrect. The federal court does have diversity jurisdiction. However, the removal statute allows for removal only
to the district where the original action is pending. Since the original lawsuit was filed in State A, the lawsuit could only
be removed to State A federal court, not State B federal court.  

 C is correct. The removal statute allows for removal only to the district embracing where the original action is pending.
Since the original lawsuit was filed in State A, the lawsuit could only be removed to State A federal court, not State B
federal court.  

 D is incorrect. This is not a basis for removal under the removal statute. 












Page 18

Question 1708 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A client sued his former attorney in federal court for malpractice. The client had retained the attorney to file and
prosecute U.S. patent applications. The client alleged that if the attorney had not omitted from the client's patent
application a portion of the computer source code for the client's invention, the resulting U.S. patent would not have
been held invalid for indefiniteness. The malpractice claim requires analysis of U.S. patent law and proof of the
patent's invalidity. Claims arising under U.S. patent law are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. In
response to the former client's complaint, the attorney moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  

 How should the court rule on that motion?  

A: The court should deny the motion to dismiss because plaintiff's right to relief depends on the resolution of a
substantial, disputed question of federal law. 
B: The court should deny the motion to dismiss because federal patent law completely preempts the plaintiff's
malpractice claim. 
C: The court should grant the motion to dismiss because the claim cannot arise under federal law since it is a state-
law created claim. 
D: The court should grant the motion to dismiss because the claim does not sufficiently raise a substantial, disputed
question of federal law to support federal jurisdiction. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer D is the correct answer. Under 28 U.S. § 1338, federal subject-matter jurisdiction extends to any case in
which a well-pleaded complaint asserts either a cause of action that federal patent law creates or a state-law created
claim in which a plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent
law. Under Gunn v. Minton, 133 S.Ct. 1059 (2013), malpractice claims do not automatically invoke federal subject-
matter jurisdiction just because there is an underlying patent claim involved in the case. Instead a four-point test is
used: federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed,
(3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by
Congress. Here, the plaintiff’s right to relief does not depend on the resolution of a substantial, disputed question of
federal patent law. The claim is a state-law created malpractice claim, and the embedded federal issue is not
sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction because it presents only a hypothetical question (would inclusion
of computer source code in the patent application have prevented the patent from being held invalid for
indefiniteness?) and is fact-bound. Therefore, Answer A is incorrect.  

 Answer B is incorrect because federal patent law does not completely preempt the plaintiff's malpractice claim in this
case. The patent issue involved in the case is not a substantial, disputed question of federal patent law that would
support federal jurisdiction.  

 Answer C is incorrect because a state-law created claim could still arise under federal law in some instances. Not all
state-law created claims are automatically blocked from federal court. In this case, the claim is not allowed because
there is not a substantial, disputed question of federal patent law that would support federal jurisdiction.  











Page 19

Question 1716 - Civil Procedure - Jurisdiction and Venue (2/11/2017) 

The question was: 

A foreign machinery manufacturer made arrangements with distributors around the world, including those in Country
E. The manufacturer would sell to distributors the number of machines the distributors respectively ordered and would
ship the machines to distribution centers designated by the distributors. The distributors would then be responsible for
advertising, selling, delivering, and servicing the machines.  

 A company operating in State A purchased five machines from a State B distributor. Both states are in Country E.
The manufacturer was aware of this purchase and was pleased about it. An employee of the State A company was
seriously injured while using one of the machines. The employee sued the manufacturer in State A state court,
alleging design defects and negligent manufacture. The manufacturer timely moved to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction. In opposition to the motion to dismiss, the employee argued that similar machines made by the
manufacturer had been sold in State A over the last decade, generating significant profits for the manufacturer and
that the State B distributor had advertised, in State A, both the product and the State B distributor's services. The
State A long-arm statute authorizes the assertion of jurisdiction over the manufacturer. The only question is the
constitutionality of State A's assertion of personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer.  

 Should the court grant the manufacturer's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction?  

A: Yes, because the manufacturer's knowledge that its machines were being advertised, sold and delivered to State A
by a distributor did not amount to "purposefully availing itself" of the benefits and protections of State A's law or
market. 
B: Yes, because a state can assert personal jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer only where the manufacturer is
incorporated or has its principal place of business in the forum state, and the manufacturer was neither incorporated
nor had its principal place of business in State A. 
C: No, because a manufacturer is subject to personal jurisdiction in any state in which its product arrived through the
stream of commerce, was sold to the ultimate consumer, and caused injury. The manufacturer sought to derive
revenue from State A, could foresee being haled there to defend a lawsuit arising out of injury there, and suffers no
unconstitutional unfairness if required to defend there. 
D: No, because the manufacturer targeted Country E by establishing distributors there and thereby purposefully
availed itself of the laws and market of each state, including State A. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is correct. It cannot be said that the manufacturer purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of State
A's laws. Here, the manufacturer hired a State B distributor. Although the manufacturer was aware of the company's
purchase from the distributor, the purchases were made in State B, not State A. As such, the manufacturer designed
its machines in anticipation of sales in State B, but not State A. Moreover, the distributor was responsible for all
advertising, not the manufacturer. The manufacturer did not engage in conduct purposefully directed toward State A,
in particular. Thus, the court cannot assert personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer.  

   B is incorrect. This would not be an instance of general personal jurisdiction, as the claim arose out of a machine the
manufacturer made which arrived in State A through the stream of commerce. It is also not true that general personal
jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer may be exercised only where the manufacturer is incorporated or has its
principal place of business, although this usually is the case.  

 C is incorrect. A manufacturer submitting their machine into the stream of commerce is not alone sufficient to justify
personal jurisdiction in any state. Here, the manufacturer did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits and
protections of State A's laws. Instead, the manufacturer had a State B distributor, the sale of the machine was in State
B, and the manufacturer had no control over advertising, which was the distributor's responsibility. Therefore, the court
cannot exert personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer.  

 D is incorrect. The position taken here (that by targeting a country, a manufacturer targets each state within that
country) was rejected by the United States Supreme Court.

Question 1658 - Civil Procedure - Jury Trials (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

A woman, a citizen of State A, sued a State B corporation in a one-count complaint filed in the federal district court in
State B. The complaint alleged that the corporation breached its lease, demanded a jury trial under the Seventh
Amendment, and asked the court for a writ of ejectment. Lawyers for the corporation argue that the woman is not
entitled to a jury.  

 How will the judge rule?  

A: The woman is entitled to a jury because the Seventh Amendment applies only to suits at common law, and this is a
lawsuit at common law. 
B: The woman is not entitled to a jury because the Seventh Amendment applies only to suits at common law, and this
is a lawsuit in equity. 
C: The woman is entitled to a jury because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure eliminated the distinction between
law and equity. 
D: The woman is not entitled to a jury because the Seventh Amendment applies only to suits at equity, and this is a
lawsuit at common law. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is correct. Even though ejectment does not seek monetary damages, it was historically a writ at common law and
hence triggers the Seventh Amendment's jury guarantee.  

 B is incorrect. Even though ejectment does not seek monetary damages, it historically was a writ at common law.  

 C is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure eliminated the distinction between law and equity for many
purposes -- for instance, for purposes of pleading -- but not for purposes of the Seventh Amendment.  

 D is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment applies only to suits at common law. 












Page 21

Question 1758 - Civil Procedure - Jury Trials (6/27/2016) 

The question was: 

A patient sued a doctor, each a private party, in an action properly brought in the federal district court of State A.
Neither the patient nor the doctor filed a jury demand. Neither the patient nor the doctor served the opposing party
with a jury demand within 14 days after the last pleading was served.  

 Under these circumstances, the court is free to take each of the following actions except which one?  

A: On motion, order a jury trial on any issue for which a jury might have been demanded.  
B: In an action not triable of right by a jury, try any issue with an advisory jury.  
C: In an action not triable of right by a jury, on the motion of any party, try an issue to a jury whose verdict will have
the same effect as if a jury trial had been a matter of right. 
D: With consent from all parties, in an action not triable of right by a jury, try any issue by a jury whose verdict has the
same effect as if a jury trial had been a matter of right. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(a) allows parties to demand a jury trial on any issue for which a jury may have been
demanded.  

 B is incorrect. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 39(c), in an action in which a jury may not have been demanded, the court is
permitted to try any issue with an advisory jury.  

 C is correct. If an action is not an issue for which a jury might have been demanded, no rule permits a court to grant a
jury trial without the parties' consent.  

 D is incorrect. Fed.R.Civ.P. 39(c)(2) requires a court to obtain the parties' consent prior to trying an action that is not
triable of right by jury. 












Page 22

Question 1757 - Civil Procedure - Jury Trials (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A nurse filed suit against a medical company in federal court in State A asserting that a drug manufactured by the
medical company was the proximate cause of her injuries. The nurse filed timely and furnished the medical company
with a written request of the jury instruction on proximate cause that the nurse wanted the court to give. The court
informed the parties that it would not give the instruction that the nurse requested and told the parties the essence of
the instruction on proximate cause the court proposed to give. The court then gave the parties an opportunity to object
on the record and out of the jury's presence. The nurse objected to the court's refusal to give the instruction that the
nurse proposed and stated the grounds for her objection, but the nurse did not separately object to the instruction that
the court proposed to give. After the parties made their final arguments to the jury, the court instructed the jury on
proximate cause. The court's instructions to the jury regarding proximate cause were modified from the instruction that
the court had previously proposed to the parties. The nurse promptly objected to the judge's instruction on proximate
cause. Thereafter, the jury returned a verdict for the medical company, and the trial court entered judgment for the
medical company. The nurse filed a timely notice of appeal, arguing that the judge's proximate cause instruction was
erroneous and prejudicial.  

 Is the appellate court likely to find an assignment of error?   

A: No, the court will likely find the nurse's objection was untimely and that the alleged error should therefore be
reviewed under the "plain error" standard of review. 
B: No, the court will likely find the nurse's objection was untimely and that, as a result, the nurse waived the error,
such that the appeals court would not consider this assignment of error at all. 
C: Yes, the court will likely find the nurse's objection was made timely but was waived because the nurse did not
timely object to the instruction the court informed the parties that it proposed to give. 
D: Yes, the court will likely find that the nurse's objection was timely, that the nurse did not waive her objection, and
that the appeals court would rule on the merits of the nurse's objection to the instruction that the trial court gave to the
jury. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The nurse's objection in this case was not untimely because the nurse objected promptly once she
learned of the instruction that the judge gave. Moreover, even if the nurse's objection had been untimely in this case,
the appeals court would be required to review the instruction for plain error because the error would have affected the
nurse's substantial right. See Rule Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(2).  

 B is incorrect.  The nurse's objection in this case was not untimely and was made promptly after the nurse learned of
the instructions the judge gave to the jury. Therefore, the appeals court could find this an assignment of error.  

 C is incorrect. Here, the nurse's failure to timely object to the court's proposed proximate cause instruction should
have no bearing on the nurse's objection to the different jury instruction that the trial court in fact gave to the jury.  

 D is correct. The nurse's objection in this case was not untimely because the court did not afford the parties an earlier
opportunity to object to the jury instructions that the judge ultimately gave. The nurse objected once she learned of the
instruction that was given. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(2)(B).  












Page 23

Question 1662 - Civil Procedure - Jury Trials (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A man from State A sues a woman from State B in federal district court in State B. The man's complaint alleges that
the woman violated a federal statute. The statute authorizes private causes of action, but permits only injunctive and
declaratory relief. The statute entitles plaintiffs to demand a jury. In her answer, the woman requests a trial by jury.
The man argues that the woman is not entitled to a jury.  

 How is the court likely to rule?  

A: The woman is not entitled to a jury because injunctive and declaratory relief are equitable remedies, and the
Seventh Amendment prohibits juries in suits in equity. 
B: The woman is entitled to a jury because the federal statute authorizes jury trials in these circumstances. 
C: The woman is not entitled to a jury because the federal statute does not authorize jury trials in these
circumstances. 
D: The woman is entitled to a jury because the Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury in these circumstances. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment only guarantees a jury trial to what, historically, were suits at common law,
but does not prohibit Congress from statutorily granting a jury right to claims that fall outside the Seventh
Amendment's guarantee.  

 B is incorrect. Although Congress has the power to create statutory jury rights, it has not done so here; the statute
provides only that plaintiffs can demand a jury, and the Seventh Amendment does not guarantee a jury because the
plaintiff is seeking exclusively equitable remedies.  

 C is correct. The Seventh Amendment does not guarantee a jury because the plaintiff is seeking exclusively equitable
remedies. Although Congress has the power to create statutory jury rights, it has not done so here; the statute
provides that plaintiffs can demand a jury, but the woman is the defendant.  

 D is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment only guarantees a jury to what, historically, were suits at common law, and
the plaintiff's lawsuit seeks only equitable remedies. 












Page 24

Question 1752 - Civil Procedure - Jury Trials (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

Representatives of estates of individuals who died in an airplane crash in State A file suit in federal court against the
foreign manufacturer of the aircraft that crashed. Foreign manufacturers can only be sued in federal court as a result
of Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act ("FSIA"), which grants federal jurisdiction over foreign instrumentalities when a
foreign state engages in commercial activity. Prior to FSIA, foreign instrumentalities were not suable at common law.
The representatives contended that FSIA violates the Seventh Amendment because it requires suits against foreign
state instrumentalities to be tried by a judge, rather than a jury. The representatives demanded a jury trial. The
representative's claim is a wrongful death action that seeks money damages and exemplifies the types of legal actions
tried by juries. The foreign manufacturer moved to strike the representatives jury demand.   

 Should the court strike the jury demand?   

A: No. The court should not strike the jury demand because the representatives' right to a jury trial under the Seventh
Amendment stems from the fact that the representatives' wrongful death claim exemplifies the types of claims tried by
juries. 
B: No. The court should not strike the jury demand because the representatives' right to jury trial under the Seventh
Amendment stems from the nature of the representative's claims and the FSIA's grant of federal jurisdiction over
foreign instrumentalities.  
C: Yes. The court should strike the jury demand because, to warrant protection under the Seventh Amendment, the
claims must not only be legal; they must also be asserted against the type of defendant suable at common law in
1791. A sovereign was not properly a defendant in a suit at common law in 1791.  
D: Yes. The court should strike the jury demand because providing a Seventh Amendment jury would violate the
FSIA.  

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Although the representatives' claims exemplify the types of claims tried by juries, this does not, in and of
itself, make the representatives' wrongful death claim determinative of the representative's right to a jury trial under the
Seventh Amendment. The determination of whether the Seventh Amendment preserves the right to a jury trial is
historical and turns on whether the claim or relief was available in 1791. Because foreign instrumentalities were not
the type of defendant that was suable at common law, the representatives' claim was not available in 1791.  

 B is incorrect. FSIA's statutory grant of federal jurisdiction over foreign instrumentalities does not add to the
representative's claim that FSIA violates the Seventh Amendment. Here, the representatives' claim and relief against
the foreign manufacturer was not a claim at law recognized in 1791. Therefore, despite FSIA's grant of federal
jurisdiction, the nature of the representatives' claim does not satisfy the Seventh Amendment's jury trial requirements.  

 C is correct. The Seventh Amendment's right to a jury trial requires that claims be both legal and be asserted against
the type of defendant that was suable at common law in 1791. Foreign instrumentalities were not suable at common
law in 1791. As such, the representatives' claims do not satisfy the Seventh Amendment's requirements right for a jury
trial.  

 D is incorrect. The mere fact that providing a Seventh Amendment jury would violate FSIA is not determinative of the
representatives' right to a jury trial if the FSIA's denial of a right to jury trial violates the Seventh Amendment.  














Page 25

Question 1657 - Civil Procedure - Jury Trials (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

An employer, a citizen of State A, sues an employee, a citizen of State B, in State B state court. The one-count
complaint seeks an injunction that would prevent the employee from accepting a job that the employer claims would
violate a valid covenant not to compete. The employee answers the complaint, in which he demands a jury trial under
the Seventh Amendment.  

 Will the court require a jury on the employee's legal theory?  

A: No, because the Seventh Amendment has not been incorporated against the states. 
B: Yes, because the Seventh Amendment only applies to suits at common law, and this is a suit in law since it
involves interpretation of a contract. 
C: No, because the Seventh Amendment only applies to suits at common law, and this is a suit in equity since it seeks
an injunction. 
D: Yes, the Seventh Amendment applies here because the injunctive relief has more than de minimus value. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is correct. The Seventh Amendment is only applicable to federal courts, not state courts. State law determines
whether parties have a right to a jury in state courts.  

 B is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment is only applicable to federal courts, not state courts. State law determines
whether parties have a right to a jury in state courts. Moreover, this would be deemed a suit in equity because it seeks
only an injunction, a form of equitable relief.  

 C is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment is only applicable to federal courts, not state courts. State law determines
whether parties have a right to a jury in state courts.  

 D is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment is only applicable to federal courts, not state courts. State law determines
whether parties have a right to a jury in state courts. Moreover, equitable relief is not monetized to satisfy the Seventh
Amendment's amount in controversy requirement.

Question 1658 - Civil Procedure - Jury Trials (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A woman, a citizen of State A, sued a State B corporation in a one-count complaint filed in the federal district court in
State B. The complaint alleged that the corporation breached its lease, demanded a jury trial under the Seventh
Amendment, and asked the court for a writ of ejectment. Lawyers for the corporation argue that the woman is not
entitled to a jury.  

 How will the judge rule?  

A: The woman is entitled to a jury because the Seventh Amendment applies only to suits at common law, and this is a
lawsuit at common law. 
B: The woman is not entitled to a jury because the Seventh Amendment applies only to suits at common law, and this
is a lawsuit in equity. 
C: The woman is entitled to a jury because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure eliminated the distinction between
law and equity. 
D: The woman is not entitled to a jury because the Seventh Amendment applies only to suits at equity, and this is a
lawsuit at common law. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is correct. Even though ejectment does not seek monetary damages, it was historically a writ at common law and
hence triggers the Seventh Amendment's jury guarantee.  

 B is incorrect. Even though ejectment does not seek monetary damages, it historically was a writ at common law.  

 C is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure eliminated the distinction between law and equity for many
purposes -- for instance, for purposes of pleading -- but not for purposes of the Seventh Amendment.  

 D is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment applies only to suits at common law.

Question 1636 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (6/26/2016) 

The question was: 

A soldier from State A filed suit against a defendant from State B in a federal court in State B seeking $100,000 in
damages for injuries resulting from a car accident that occurred on an army base in State B. The defendant was not
negligent, and State B tort law allows recovery only upon a showing of negligence. There is no applicable federal
statute.  

 Which of the following statements is true?  

A: The court must dismiss the soldier's claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the
only possible source of a legal right would be state law or federal statute, and neither grants the soldier rights here. 
B: The soldier might have a viable claim, but only if the court were persuaded that there was a peculiarly strong
federal interest to create a federal common law of torts that applied to accidents involving servicemen on army bases. 
C: The court must dismiss the soldier's claim; although federal courts used to create federal common law before Erie,
that decision declared the end of federal common law. 
D: The soldier might have a viable claim, but only if federal choice of law rules determined that State A tort law applied
and if the soldier would have a valid claim under that State A law. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Federal common law is an additional possible source of law upon which a plaintiff's rights might be
grounded. Therefore, it is not true that there is no other potential source of relief for the soldier.  

 B is correct. Federal courts have the authority to create federal common law and may do so in areas of peculiarly
strong federal interest. Torts relating to servicemen is one such field where there is a peculiarly strong federal interest.
Therefore, the soldier may have a viable claim if the court were persuaded to create a federal common law of torts
relating to accidents involving servicemen on army bases.  

 C is incorrect. Although Erie declared the end of "federal general common law," federal courts continue to create
federal common law in areas of peculiarly strong federal interest. Torts in relation to servicemen are one such field of
peculiarly strong federal interest.  

 D is incorrect. A federal court sitting in diversity (as this court would be, unless the soldier's claims were grounded in
federal common law) would apply the choice of law rules of the state in which the federal court is situated, not federal
choice of law rules.

Question 1635 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (6/26/2016) 

The question was: 

Plaintiff filed a diversity action, pressing business tort claims, against Defendant in federal court in State A. The State
A federal court dismissed Plaintiff's action "on the merits and with prejudice," in accordance with State A law, because
all claims fell outside State A's two-year statute of limitations. Plaintiff refiled the diversity action against Defendant in
federal court in State B. State B law treats dismissals on grounds of statute of limitations as dismissals without
prejudice. Defendant files a motion to dismiss, citing to the State A court's judgment.  

 What is the State B federal court likely to do?  

A: Deny Defendant's motion; the preclusive effect of the State A judgment is determined by State B law since this is a
diversity action. 
B: Grant Defendant's motion; the preclusive effect of the State A judgment is governed by federal common law, which
incorporates State A law. 
C: Deny Defendant's motion; to give prejudicial effect to a dismissal on statute of limitations grounds would violate the
United States Constitution. 
D: Grant Defendant's motion; the preclusive effect of the State A judgment is a substantive issue for purposes of Erie
and hence is governed by State A state law. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect because it is State A's law that determines the preclusive effect of the State A federal court's diversity
judgment, not State B's law.  

 B is correct. The preclusive effect of a federal court's judgment in diversity is determined by federal common law, but
federal common law incorporates the law of the state in which the federal court that issued the judgment is situated.  

 C is incorrect. There is no such constitutional limitation.  

 D is incorrect. The preclusive effect of a federal court's judgment is determined by federal common law, not state law.
The federal common law incorporates state law, but it still has the status of federal law.

Question 1629 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (6/27/2016) 

The question was: 

A geologist filed a diversity action against a farmer in federal court in State A, seeking recovery for the damage to her
very expensive sports car and the broken arm that she suffered as a result of a car crash with the farmer. At trial, after
two days of testimony, the jury returned a verdict for the geologist and awarded her $75,000 in compensatory
damages. Under federal law, a judge who believes compensatory damages are so excessive as to "shock the
conscience" can offer the plaintiff the choice between a new trial or remittitur of the excessive damages. Under
substantive State A law, the court can reduce a jury's awards by way of remittitur if it thinks damages are "excessive."  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The farmer should submit only a motion for remittitur, on the ground that the jury's damage award "shocks the
conscience." 
B: The farmer should submit a joint motion for new trial and remittitur, on the ground that the jury's damage award
"shocks the conscience." 
C: The farmer should submit only a motion for remittitur, on the ground that the jury's damage award was "excessive." 
D: The farmer should submit a joint motion for new trial and remittitur, on the ground that the jury's damage award
was "excessive." 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Under the Erie doctrine, a court is required to apply the substantive law of the state in which it is sitting.
Federal courts sitting in diversity apply the remittitur rules of the state in which they are situated. Therefore, the
appropriate remittitur standard is "excessive" rather than "shocks the conscience."  

 B is incorrect. Under the Erie doctrine, federal courts sitting in diversity apply the remittitur rules of the state in which
they are situated. Therefore, he appropriate remittitur standard is "excessive" rather than "shocks the conscience."  

 C is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment does not allow a federal court to disregard a jury's damages finding and
order remittitur. Instead, the court must offer plaintiff the choice between a new trial or the reduced award. A motion
for remittitur accordingly must be paired with a motion for a new trial – and that is why Answer D is correct.  

 D is correct. Under the Erie doctrine, federal courts sitting in diversity apply the remittitur rules of the state in which
they are situated; hence the appropriate remittitur standard is "excessive" rather than "shocks the conscience."

Question 1626 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A lumberjack properly brought a single-count complaint alleging medical malpractice against a doctor in the federal
district court of State A. The jury found for the lumberjack and awarded him $2.5 million in damages. Federal law
permits a judge to set aside a jury's verdict and order a new trial if the jury's award "shocks the conscience," whereas
State A's tort reform statute authorizes judges to order a new trial only upon a finding of "excessive damages."  

 Which of the following is most true?  

A: The federal court can order a new trial only if the jury's award "shocks the conscience;" the federal and state
standards for ordering a new trial are different, and the federal rule accordingly preempts the state rule under the
Supremacy Clause. 
B: The federal court can order a new trial if it determines that the jury awarded excessive damages; State A's tort
reform provision concerning new trials is substantive, and hence applies to this diversity lawsuit. 
C: The federal court cannot order a new trial simply because it thinks the jury awarded excessive damages because
doing so would violate the Seventh Amendment. 
D: The federal court can order a new trial if it determines the jury awarded excessive damages, but only if State A's
choice-of-law rules would indicate that State A law applies in this circumstance. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Pursuant to the federal law known as the Rules of Decision Act, federal courts are required to apply
state laws "in cases where they apply." Therefore, the fact that the "shocks the conscience" standard is federal does
not, on its own, mean that the federal court must apply it.  

 B is correct. Because this lawsuit is based on diversity jurisdiction, the question of which law is applicable is an Erie
question. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not explicitly enumerate the "shocks the conscience" rule, so the
appropriate analysis is Erie's constitutional test, which asks whether the potentially applicable state law is substantive
or procedural.  

 C is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment's re-examination clause does not inhibit the authority of trial courts to grant
new trials for any of the reasons for which new trials have previously been granted in actions at law in the courts of the
United States. Furthermore, the court's discretion includes overturning verdicts for excessiveness and ordering a new
trial.  

 D is incorrect. Here, the district court, sitting in diversity, must apply State A's choice-of-law rules to determine which
state's law should be applied, not to determine whether state or federal law is to be applied.

Question 1630 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A pharmacist filed a lawsuit against her employer, a hospital, in federal court in State A, claiming that the hospital
violated the pharmacist's rights under Title VII's employment laws during the two weeks the pharmacist worked for the
hospital. After two days of testimony, the jury returned a verdict for the pharmacist and awarded her $2,750,000 in
compensatory damages. Under federal law, a judge who believes compensatory damages are so excessive as to
"shock the conscience" can offer the plaintiff the choice between a new trial or remittitur of the excessive damages.
Under State A law, judges can order remittitur if the court thinks damages are "excessive."  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The hospital should submit only a motion for remittitur, on the ground that the jury's damage award "shocks the
conscience." 
B: The hospital should submit only a motion for remittitur, on the ground that the jury's damage award is "excessive." 
C: The hospital should submit both a motion for new trial and, in the alternative, a motion for remittitur, on the ground
that the jury's damage award "shocks the conscience." 
D: The hospital should submit both a motion for new trial and, in the alternative, a motion for remittitur, on the ground
that the jury's damage award is "excessive." 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The Seventh Amendment does not allow a federal court to disregard a jury's damages finding and order
remittitur. Federal courts instead must offer plaintiff the choice between a new trial or the reduced award, so a motion
for remittitur must be paired with a motion for a new trial.  

 B is incorrect. Because this is not a diversity jurisdiction lawsuit – but instead is based exclusively on federal law –
this question does not raise any Erie issues, and federal law alone governs. Therefore "shocks the conscience," not
"excessive," is the appropriate standard to apply.  

 C is correct. Because this is not a diversity jurisdiction lawsuit – but instead is based exclusively on federal law – this
question does not raise any Erie issues, and federal law alone governs. Therefore "shocks the conscience," not
"excessive," is the appropriate standard to apply.  

  D is incorrect. Because this is not a diversity jurisdiction lawsuit – but instead is based exclusively on federal law –
this question does not raise any Erie issues, and federal law alone governs. Therefore "shocks the conscience," not
"excessive," is the appropriate standard to apply.

Question 1623 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

An oboist from State A filed a diversity action against a band director in federal court in State A, pursuant to a contract
dispute in which the oboist sought $195,000 in damages. At trial, after four days of testimony, the jury returned a
verdict in favor of the oboist, but found compensatory damages of only $2.25. Under federal law, a judge who believes
compensatory damages are so excessive as to "shock the conscience" can offer the plaintiff the choice between a
new trial or remittitur of the excessive damages. Under State A law, judges can offer plaintiffs the choice of a new trial
or remittitur if the court thinks damages are "excessive," and offer defendant a choice between a new trial or additur if
the court thinks damages are "inadequate."  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The oboist can make a motion seeking a new trial or additur on the ground that the jury's damage award shocks
the conscience. 
B: The oboist can make a motion seeking a new trial or additur on the ground that the jury's damage award is
inadequate. 
C: The oboist should make a motion for remittitur on the ground that the jury's damage award shocks the conscience. 
D: The oboist's only option is to make a motion for new trial on the ground that the verdict is inadequate. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Although federal courts sitting in diversity apply the remittitur rules of the state in which they are
situated, the Supreme Court has held that additur violates the Seventh Amendment; the Seventh Amendment does
not apply to state courts, so states may have additur rules. Consequently, there are no federal additur rules and A is
wrong.  

 B is incorrect. Although federal courts sitting in diversity apply the remittitur rules of the state in which they are
situated, the Supreme Court has held that additur violates the Seventh Amendment; the Seventh Amendment does
not apply to state courts, so states may have additur rules. Consequently, there are no federal additur rules and a
federal court sitting in diversity does not apply the state's additur rules, therefore B is wrong.  

 C is incorrect. First, a federal court sitting in diversity would apply the state's remittitur rule, such that the standard
would be "excessive" rather than "shocking the conscience."  Second, remittitur is inapplicable to these facts.  

 D is correct. The oboist's only option is to file a motion for new trial on the ground that the verdict is inadequate.

the conscience. 
B: The oboist can make a motion seeking a new trial or additur on the ground that the jury's damage award is
inadequate. 
C: The oboist should make a motion for remittitur on the ground that the jury's damage award shocks the conscience. 
D: The oboist's only option is to make a motion for new trial on the ground that the verdict is inadequate. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Although federal courts sitting in diversity apply the remittitur rules of the state in which they are
situated, the Supreme Court has held that additur violates the Seventh Amendment; the Seventh Amendment does
not apply to state courts, so states may have additur rules. Consequently, there are no federal additur rules and A is
wrong.  

 B is incorrect. Although federal courts sitting in diversity apply the remittitur rules of the state in which they are
situated, the Supreme Court has held that additur violates the Seventh Amendment; the Seventh Amendment does
not apply to state courts, so states may have additur rules. Consequently, there are no federal additur rules and a
federal court sitting in diversity does not apply the state's additur rules, therefore B is wrong.  

 C is incorrect. First, a federal court sitting in diversity would apply the state's remittitur rule, such that the standard
would be "excessive" rather than "shocking the conscience."  Second, remittitur is inapplicable to these facts.  

 D is correct. The oboist's only option is to file a motion for new trial on the ground that the verdict is inadequate.

Question 1625 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

An instructor brought a successful single-count lawsuit against a charter school in State A federal court. The judge
found that the charter school had violated federal employment laws, and awarded money damages to the instructor in
the amount of $182,000. The charter school appealed and lost. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure permit an
appellate court to punish frivolous appeals by assessing extra costs. A State A statute automatically adds a 15%
penalty to an unsuccessful appeal of an award of money damages.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The appellate court must assess a 15% penalty to the charter school's unsuccessful appeal since the federal court
is situated in State A. 
B: The appellate court must apply Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, not the State A statute; the State A statute
clashes with the federal rule, and federal law prevails over inconsistent state law. 
C: The appellate court must assess a 15% penalty to the charter school's unsuccessful appeal, but only if the court
determines that the State A statute is substantive rather than procedural. 
D: The appellate court must apply Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, not the State A statute, because only the
federal rule applies in this circumstance. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The mere fact that the federal court is situated in State A does not mean that State A law applies.  

 B is incorrect. State A law does not apply simply because the federal court is situated in State A.  

 C is incorrect. This answer invokes Erie analysis, but is incorrect because this is a federal question case, not a
diversity lawsuit and, therefore, no Erie analysis is necessary because only federal law applies.  

 D is correct. Because this is not a diversity lawsuit -- but is a federal question case – no Erie issues are raised,
meaning that only federal law applies.

Question 1633 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A calligrapher brought a diversity action against an illustrator in federal court in State A. The calligrapher's single-
count complaint seeks damages for breach of contract. The contract that is the subject of the lawsuit has a clause
providing that "any lawsuits concerning this contract shall be brought in State C." A State A statute provides that forum
selection clauses are unenforceable. The illustrator then filed a motion to transfer with the federal court in State A
asking the court to transfer the action to State C.  

 What is the court likely to do?  

A: Deny the motion, because this is a diversity action and State A law provides that forum selection clauses are
unenforceable. 
B: Grant the motion, because federal law provides that forum selection clauses are enforceable. 
C: Grant the motion, because State A law is inapplicable since the contract has a choice-of-law provision, not a forum
selection clause. 
D: Consider the motion, because federal courts can weigh all factors, including the presence of a forum selection
clause, when deciding a motion to transfer under the federal transfer statute. This is true even when the lawsuit is
based on diversity jurisdiction. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has ruled that the federal transfer statute, which gives federal courts discretionary
power to grant transfer motions, is applicable even in diversity actions.  

   B is incorrect. There is no federal law giving automatic effect to forum selection clauses.  

   C is incorrect. The contractual provision is a forum selection clause, not a choice-of-law provision; it indicates where
the lawsuit is to be filed, not what state's substantive law is to be applied.  

 D is correct. The court should consider the motion because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a
federal court may weigh all factors when deciding a motion to transfer under the federal transfer statute.

D: The farmer should submit a joint motion for new trial and remittitur, on the ground that the jury's damage award
was "excessive." 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Under the Erie doctrine, a court is required to apply the substantive law of the state in which it is sitting.
Federal courts sitting in diversity apply the remittitur rules of the state in which they are situated. Therefore, the
appropriate remittitur standard is "excessive" rather than "shocks the conscience."  

 B is incorrect. Under the Erie doctrine, federal courts sitting in diversity apply the remittitur rules of the state in which

Question 1636 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A soldier from State A filed suit against a defendant from State B in a federal court in State B seeking $100,000 in
damages for injuries resulting from a car accident that occurred on an army base in State B. The defendant was not
negligent, and State B tort law allows recovery only upon a showing of negligence. There is no applicable federal
statute.  

 Which of the following statements is true?  

A: The court must dismiss the soldier's claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the
only possible source of a legal right would be state law or federal statute, and neither grants the soldier rights here. 
B: The soldier might have a viable claim, but only if the court were persuaded that there was a peculiarly strong
federal interest to create a federal common law of torts that applied to accidents involving servicemen on army bases. 
C: The court must dismiss the soldier's claim; although federal courts used to create federal common law before Erie,
that decision declared the end of federal common law. 
D: The soldier might have a viable claim, but only if federal choice of law rules determined that State A tort law applied
and if the soldier would have a valid claim under that State A law. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Federal common law is an additional possible source of law upon which a plaintiff's rights might be
grounded. Therefore, it is not true that there is no other potential source of relief for the soldier.  

 B is correct. Federal courts have the authority to create federal common law and may do so in areas of peculiarly
strong federal interest. Torts relating to servicemen is one such field where there is a peculiarly strong federal interest.
Therefore, the soldier may have a viable claim if the court were persuaded to create a federal common law of torts
relating to accidents involving servicemen on army bases.  

 C is incorrect. Although Erie declared the end of "federal general common law," federal courts continue to create
federal common law in areas of peculiarly strong federal interest. Torts in relation to servicemen are one such field of
peculiarly strong federal interest.  

 D is incorrect. A federal court sitting in diversity (as this court would be, unless the soldier's claims were grounded in
federal common law) would apply the choice of law rules of the state in which the federal court is situated, not federal
choice of law rules.

Question 1632 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A dancer filed a lawsuit against her employer, a ballet company, in federal court in State A, claiming that the ballet
company violated the dancer's rights under Title VII's employment laws. The ballet company is a small business, and
the dancer is concerned that the ballet company might not have sufficient assets to pay the judgment that the dancer
hopes to win. State A law provides a method for attaching property at the start of a lawsuit to secure satisfaction of
potential judgments. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 64 provides that "every remedy is available that, under the law of
the state where the court is located, provides for seizing a person or property to secure satisfaction of the potential
judgment."  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The dancer cannot make use of State A's attachment law in this case because this is not a diversity action. 
B: The dancer can make use of State A's attachment law in this case, even though the federal court is exercising only
federal question jurisdiction. 
C: The dancer can make use of State A's attachment law in this case, but only if she adds a state law claim to the
lawsuit. 
D: The dancer can make use of State A's attachment law in this case, but (1) only if she adds a state law claim to the
lawsuit, and with the added condition that (2) she can attach property only up to the expected value of her state law
claim. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The availability of state law remedies under FRCP 64 does not depend on the federal case being a
diversity action.  

 B is correct. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 64 incorporates state law, providing that every remedy is available that,
under the law of the state where the federal court is located, provides for seizing property to secure satisfaction of a
potential judgment.  

 C is incorrect. There is no requirement that there be some state law claim in the lawsuit.  

 D is incorrect. There is no such federal limitation on the value of the garnishment.

Question 1628 - Civil Procedure - Law Applied by Federal Courts (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A garbage man, a citizen of State A, sues a truck driver, a citizen of State B, in federal court in State B, seeking
$125,000 as compensation for injuries suffered in a car accident that occurred in State A. State B law does not permit
a court to order plaintiffs to submit to examination by physicians, but State A law does. The truck driver files a motion
with the court, challenging the garbage man's claimed injuries and requests that the garbage man be ordered to
submit to an examination by a physician.  

 Should the court grant the truck driver's motion?  

A: Yes; the court should grant the truck driver's motion, but only if State B choice-of-law rules indicate that State A tort
law applies in this case. 
B: No; the court should deny the truck driver's motion; State B law applies because this is a diversity suit and the
federal court is situated in State B. 
C: Yes; the court should grant the truck driver's motion; the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize courts to order
a physical examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner, and this federal rule applies in diversity cases. 
D: No; the court should deny the truck driver's motion; the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not authorize courts to
order physical examinations by physicians, and this federal rule applies in diversity cases. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is incorrect. Federal procedural rules govern this question, not state law.  

 Answer B is incorrect. Federal procedural rules govern this question, not state law.  

 C is correct. Fed.R.Civ.P. 35 specifically authorizes the court where the action is pending to order a physical or
mental examination of a party whose mental or physical condition, including blood group, is in controversy. That
federal rule is deemed procedural and, accordingly, is applicable even in diversity actions.  

 D is incorrect. Federal law permits courts to order physical examinations, as stated above.

The question was: 

A woman filed a diversity action against a man in federal court in State A, alleging that the man failed to pay a debt
due on a valid contract. The man has paid the debt, and has the cancelled checks to prove it.  

 What should the man's attorneys do?  

A: File a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, attaching an affidavit with the
cancelled checks. 
B: File an answer and then a motion for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit with the cancelled checks. 
C: File only a motion for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit with the cancelled checks. 
D: File a motion for judgment as a matter of law, attaching an affidavit with the cancelled checks. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The woman has stated a valid a claim in this case; it is simply a claim to which the man has a defense.  

 B is correct. The man has a valid defense, but it is not one of the defenses that can be asserted in a pre-answer Rule
12 motion to dismiss. Therefore, the man accordingly must file an answer. Because the man's defense relies on
material outside the pleadings, the man should file a motion for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit with the
cancelled checks.  

 C is incorrect. While a party may file a motion for summary judgment at any time until 30 days after the close of all
discovery, this does not prove to be the best course of action for the man's attorney.  

 D is incorrect. A motion for judgment as a matter of law is made at the time of trial, and there has not been a trial
here.

Question 1674 - Civil Procedure - Motions (6/27/2016) 

The question was: 

A handyman filed a diversity action against a homeowner in federal court in State A, alleging that the homeowner
failed to pay $150,000 due on a valid service contract between the parties for the handyman to install a bathroom in
the homeowner's home. Discovery concluded in March, and at October's one-day trial the homeowner disputed the
contract's validity, testifying before the jury that the handyman had installed the bathroom as a gift and that the
exchanged emails referring to a "contract" between the parties had been in jest. After the close of evidence, the court
gave instructions to the jury, the jury deliberated for 15 minutes, and the jury returned a verdict for the homeowner.  

 What should the handyman's attorney do?  

A: File a motion for judgment as a matter of law. 
B: File a motion for summary judgment. 
C: File a motion for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
D: File a motion for a new trial. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. A motion for judgment as a matter of law is not timely in this case because a motion for judgment as a
matter of law must be made after evidence has been presented but before the case has been submitted to the jury.  

 B is incorrect. A motion for summary judgment is not timely in this case because summary judgment is only available
within 30 days after the close of all discovery.  

 C is incorrect. The handyman cannot make a motion for lack of personal jurisdiction because by filing his suit in State
A, the handyman has submitted to the court's jurisdiction.  

 D is correct. Neither of the motions referred to in answers A and B are timely: A motion for judgment as a matter of
law must be made after evidence has been presented but before the case has been submitted to the jury. A motion for
summary judgment is only available within 30 days after the close of all discovery. Moreover, the handyman cannot
make a motion for lack of personal jurisdiction because by filing his suit in State A, the handyman has submitted to the
court's jurisdiction. Therefore, a motion for new trial is the only available motion. This motion could plausibly be
successful on these facts and may be granted if the judge finds the verdict to be against the great weight of the
evidence.

Question 1672 - Civil Procedure - Motions (6/27/2016) 

The question was: 

A composer's wife filed a diversity action in State A federal court against an insurance company to recover insurance
proceeds pursuant to the accidental death provision of the composer's life insurance policy. The evidence shows that
the composer was last seen on a business trip seven years ago, that he has not been heard from since, and that his
body was never recovered. Under State A law, the party seeking recovery under an accidental death policy has the
burden of establishing the insured's death. The insurance company files a motion for summary judgment. In her
memorandum in opposition to the motion, the wife includes an affidavit that recites the evidence stated above and
adds "To my knowledge, my husband is dead."  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The court should deny the insurance company's motion because the insurance company has not met its burden of
showing that the composer is alive. 
B: The court should grant the insurance company's motion because the party opposing summary judgment cannot
establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact simply by means of an affidavit. 
C: The court should deny the insurance company's motion because the wife's affidavit establishes that there is a
genuine issue of material fact. 
D: The court should grant the insurance company's motion because the wife's affidavit is not made on personal
knowledge. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The insurance company does not bear the burden of showing that the composer is alive; because the
wife will have the burden of showing that the composer is dead at trial, she also bears that burden to defeat the
insurance company's motion for summary judgment.  

 B is incorrect. Federal Rule 56 specifically provides that an affidavit based on personal knowledge can be used to
support or oppose a motion for summary judgment.  

 C is incorrect. The wife's affidavit fails to establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the
composer's death because (1) the affidavit is not based on personal knowledge and (2) it does not provide any
admissible facts but merely recites her inference from the other evidence already in the record.  

 D is correct. Federal Rule 56 allows parties to augment the record by affidavits, but affidavits must be made on
personal knowledge. Here, the wife's affidavit is not based on the wife's personal knowledge, and the other pieces of
evidence are not sufficient to establish the existence of the element essential to the wife's case, namely that her
husband is dead.

Question 1766 - Civil Procedure - Motions (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

An insurance company filed suit in federal court against a pharmacy alleging that the pharmacy engaged in fraud
when it submitted claims to be reimbursed for high-priced drugs when, in fact, the pharmacy had filled prescriptions
with lower-priced generic substitutes. The insurance company sought to recoup the excess amounts it had paid the
pharmacy as a result of these allegedly false claims. The complaint did not allege the pharmacy's state of mind in
submitting the allegedly false claims nor did it state the particulars of the various allegedly false claim submissions.
The pharmacy moved to dismiss the insurance company's complaint, alleging that the insurance company failed to
meet the requirements for this type of pleading.  

 Should the court grant the pharmacy's motion to dismiss?  

A: No, because the insurance company has met the requirements for this type of pleading by providing a short and
plain statement showing that the insurance company is entitled to relief. 
B: Yes, because complaints of fraud must be plead with particularity and the insurance company has failed to meet
this requirement. 
C: No, because the insurance company's complaint does meet the requirement for this type of pleading by providing a
short statement detailing the court's jurisdiction and showing that the insurance company is entitled to relief. 
D: Yes, because complaints of fraud require a party to provide specific allegations detailing malice, which the
insurance company failed to provide. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The general rule for pleadings simply requires parties to provide a short statement detailing (1) the
court's jurisdiction and (2) that the party is entitled to relief. However, claims of fraud are special pleadings that require
a party to state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud. Here, the insurance company's complaint failed
to meet the requirements for this type of pleading.  

 B is correct. Claims of fraud are special pleadings that require a party to state with particularity the circumstances
constituting fraud. Because the insurance company failed to meet the requirements for this type of pleading, the court
should grant the pharmacy's motion to dismiss.  

 C is incorrect. Claims of fraud are special pleadings that require a party to plead more than a short statement
detailing (1) the court's jurisdiction and (2) that the party is entitled to relief. Instead, for claims of fraud, a party must
plead with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud. The insurance company failed to do here, which is the
reason the court should grant the pharmacy's motion to dismiss.  

 D is incorrect. For claims of fraud, a party is only required to plead with particularity the circumstances that constitute
the fraud. Allegations of a mental condition, such as malice, may be plead generally.

Question 1671 - Civil Procedure - Motions (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A man's wife filed a diversity action in State A federal court against an insurance company to recover insurance
proceeds pursuant to the accidental death provision of her husband's life insurance policy. The evidence shows that
the man was last seen on a business trip seven years ago and has not been heard from since. His body was never
recovered. Under State A law, the party seeking recovery under an accidental death policy has the burden of
establishing the insured's death. The wife and the insurance company both file motions for summary judgment.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The insurance company's motion should be granted; the wife has the burden of proving at trial that the man is
dead, and she has failed to produce sufficient evidence to meet this burden. 
B: The insurance company's motion should be denied. Because the insurance company has moved for summary
judgment, it has the burden of proving that the man is alive, and it has failed to produce sufficient evidence to meet its
burden. 
C: The wife's motion should be granted. The wife has the burden of proving at trial that her husband is dead and she
has produced sufficient evidence to meet this burden.  
D: Both motions should be denied. Because both the wife and the insurance company have filed motions for summary
judgment, it would be improper for the court to grant summary judgment for either party. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is correct. Summary judgment is appropriately granted against a party who cannot sufficiently establish the
existence of an essential element that the non-moving party has a burden to establish at trial. Here, the wife has the
burden of proving the man is dead, and she has failed to meet this burden.  

 B is incorrect. The wife bears the burden of establishing the man's death in order to defeat the insurance company's
motion for summary judgment. The fact that the insurance company moved for summary judgment does not displace
the wife's burden.  

 C is incorrect. It is the wife who bears the burden of establishing the man's death to defeat the insurance company's
motion for summary judgment. The evidence provided in the facts is not sufficient to meet this burden.  

 D is incorrect. The fact that two parties simultaneously move for summary judgment does not mean that neither is
entitled to summary judgment. The court must ask which party bears the burden of proof at trial and then analyze the
evidence. Here, the wife has the burden of proof at trial and, on the facts provided, has failed to meet this burden.
Therefore, the insurance company's motion for summary judgment should be granted.

Question 1779 - Civil Procedure - Motions (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

An engineer brought a patent infringement action against a company in federal court in State A, which was tried by a
jury. During the examination of one of the company's representatives, the engineer's attorney asked whether the
witness's cousin was a "bottom-feeder who swims around buying, for next to nothing, the houses of people who got
kicked out." The court then warned the engineer's counsel against making such inflammatory remarks and issued an
instruction to the jury in an effort to have it ignore such statements. In his closing argument, the engineer's attorney
once again made several irrelevant and prejudicial remarks. The company's attorney objected to the irrelevant and
prejudicial remarks made in the closing, though it had not objected earlier, and moved for a new trial.  

 How should the court rule on the new trial motion?  

A: Deny the motion because juries can see through these patently biased kinds of statements and disregard them. 
B: Deny the motion because of the company's counsel's failure to object, prior to closing arguments, to the opposing
counsel's irrelevant and prejudicial remarks. 
C: Grant the motion for a new trial because it is likely that the jury was biased by these inflammatory remarks, and
manifest injustice would result from allowing the jury's verdict to stand. 
D: Deny the motion because instructions to the jury to disregard the inflammatory statements, noting that these
statements are not evidence, cures any harm otherwise done. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. A court cannot count on the jury not to be influenced by the remarks repeatedly made by the engineer's
attorney in this case.  

 B is incorrect. The company's counsel's failure to object to some of the irrelevant and offensive remarks should not
prevent the court from awarding a new trial where it was likely that the jury was biased by the inflammatory words, and
manifest injustice would result from letting its future verdict stand. Moreover, defendant did object to some of the
remarks.  

 C is correct. The court should grant the motion for a new trial because it is likely that the jury would be biased by
repetitive derogatory comments from the engineer's attorney.  

 D is incorrect. Where improper remarks are not single, isolated occurrences but are instead repeated reminders to
the jury, the court cannot and will not count on instructions to the jury to disregard such statements, nor will it count on
instructions to the jury that such remarks are not to be considered evidence. 












Page 46

Question 1676 - Civil Procedure - Motions (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A patient from State A filed a diversity action against an intern from State B in federal court in State A, seeking
$175,000 pursuant to a contract dispute. After the patient's lawyer completed presenting evidence to the jury, but
before the intern's attorney had presented evidence, the intern's lawyer submitted a motion for judgment as a matter
of law, which the court promptly denied. The jury returned a verdict for the patient in the amount of $1,000. The
intern's lawyer submitted a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and an alternative motion for new trial.  

 What should the judge do?   

A: Deny both motions; a lawyer cannot submit both simultaneously. 
B: Deny the intern's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law; the intern's earlier motion for judgment as a
matter of law was invalid because it was submitted prematurely. 
C: Consider the merits of the intern's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law; if it is granted, the judge should
not consider the motion for new trial. 
D: Consider the merits of the intern's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law; if it is granted, the judge should
then conditionally rule on the intern's motion for new trial. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. A judgment as a matter of law explicitly allows filing of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of
law in conjunction with a motion for new trial.  

 B is incorrect. The intern’s earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law was timely; the motion may be made any
time before the case is submitted to the jury, though it may be granted only after a party has been "fully heard on an
issue during a jury trial."  

 C is incorrect. Pursuant to Federal Rule 50(c), when a court grants a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,
the court must then also conditionally rule on the motion for a new trial. Therefore, C is incorrect because the court
must consider the intern's alternative motion.  

 D is correct. Federal Rule 50(c) requires a court to conditionally rule on a motion for new trial if and when it grants a
renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.  












Page 47

Question 1776 - Civil Procedure - Motions (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

A railroad brought an action for fraud against a group of personal injury lawyers in federal district court. The railroad
alleged that the lawyers engaged in a scheme with purported medical experts to inundate the railroad with cases
involving tortious exposure to asbestos which lacked any merit. The railroad presented various forms of circumstantial
evidence, including expert testimony which stated that several of the clients in the previous asbestos cases, who were
diagnosed by the purported medical experts as suffering from asbestosis, in fact had no asbestos-related disease.
Both the lawyers and the medical experts testified and denied the allegations against them. The railroad then moved
for a judgment as a matter of law which was denied.  

 After the close of the evidence, the jury returned with a verdict in favor of the personal injury lawyers. The railroad
then moved for a renewed judgment as a matter of law.  

 When the court rules on the railroad's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, which of the following should
it do?  

A: The court should view the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the
personal injury attorneys, the non-moving parties. 
B: The court should consider the credibility of the witnesses and resolve conflicts in testimony. 
C: The court should view the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the
railroad, the moving party. 
D: The court should order a new trial because of the policy against entering judgment as a matter of law against
attorney-litigants. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is correct. When ruling on the railroad's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court should review the
evidence in favor of the non-moving party.  

 B is incorrect. When ruling on a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court should not consider the
credibility of the witnesses or attempt to resolve conflicts in testimony. Instead the court is charged with determining
whether a reasonable jury would have a sufficient legal basis to find for the nonmoving party on the issue.  

 C is incorrect. When ruling on a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court must review the evidence
in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, not the moving party.  

 D is incorrect. There is no policy that prohibits courts from entering judgments as a matter of law against attorney-
litigants. 













Page 48

Question 1765 - Civil Procedure - Motions (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

A truck driver from State A filed a proper diversity suit against a manufacturer from State B in federal court. Before
answering the truck driver's complaint, the manufacturer timely filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction. The truck driver then filed an answer to the manufacturer's pre-answer motion, detailing the
manufacturer's minimum contacts in State A due to the manufacturer's selling of goods in State A. The manufacturer
then made a second pre-answer motion claiming improper venue.  

 Should the court consider the manufacturer's defense for improper venue?  

A: Yes, because a party may raise the defense of improper venue at any time. 
B: No, because the truck driver's answer establishes that the manufacturer has minimum contacts in State A and, as
such, the court may presume that venue is proper. 
C: No, because the manufacture waived this defense by not raising it its initial pre-answer motion. 
D: Yes, because a party does not need to raise the defense of improper venue in their initial pre-answer motion. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Federal Rule 12 forbids a defendant who makes a pre-answer motion from making a further motion
presenting any defense or objection which was available to him at the time he made the first motion and which he
could have included, but did not. Thus if the defendant moves, before filing his answer, to dismiss the complaint, he is
barred from making a further motion presenting the defense of improper venue if that defense was available to him
when he made his original motion. Here, the manufacturer should have raised the defense of improper venue in its
initial pre-answer motion. Because the manufacture failed to do so, it waived this defense.  

 B is incorrect. Even if a party has minimum contacts in a state, a court may still find that venue is improper. Moreover,
a court cannot simply presume that venue is proper for a party based on a motion from an opposing party.  

 C is correct. As stated above, the defense of improper venue is waived if not raised in a responsive pleading.
Therefore, the manufacturer should have raised this defense in its initial pre-answer motion. Because it failed to do so,
it waived this defense.  

 D is incorrect. As stated above, the defense of improper venue is waived if not raised in a responsive pleading.
Therefore, because it was not raised in the manufacturer's initial pre-answer motion, will has been waived. 












Page 49

Question 1767 - Civil Procedure - Motions (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

An investor sued a stockbroker in federal court on a federal statutory claim for securities fraud. The stockbroker's
attorney is trying to decide whether to file a preanswer motion or to merely file an answer to the complaint that
includes the stockbroker's defenses.  

 Which of the following is not a valid consideration in making this decision?  

A: Filing a preanswer motion will extend the time that the stockbroker has to answer the complaint. 
B: If the stockbroker simply files an answer, for a limited time the stockbroker will have the right to amend her answer
as a matter of course, whereas the Federal Rules do not provide for the amendment of motions and a failure to raise
some defenses in a preanswer motion will result in the waiver of those defenses. 
C: Unlike in filing an answer, by making a preanswer motion, the stockbroker does not need to concern herself with
certifying to the court that the motion is not presented for an improper purpose, that the allegations in the motion have
evidentiary support, and that the legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law. 
D: The stockbroker cannot request a more definite statement in her answer, but can include such a request in her
preanswer motion. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. This is a valid consideration because a preanswer motion will extend the time that the stockbroker has
to answer the investor's complaint. This consideration could affect a defendant's decision whether to file a preanswer
motion under Federal Rule 12 or instead to just file an answer to the complaint that includes defendant's defenses.  

 B is incorrect. This is a valid consideration. If the stockbroker were to file an answer without a preanswer motion, for a
limited time, the stockbroker would have the ability to amend her answer. By contrast, a party may not amend its
preanswer motions and if a party fails to raise a defense during those preanswer motions, except for the defense of
lack of subject matter jurisdiction, these defenses will be considered waived. This consideration could affect a
defendant's decision whether to file a preanswer motion under Federal Rule 12 or instead to just file an answer to the
complaint that includes defendant's defenses.  

 C is correct. This is an invalid consideration. Written motions, just as pleadings and other papers, are governed by
Federal Rule 11, which requires parties to certify that the information presented to the court is not being presented for
an improper purpose, that the allegations and factual contentions have evidentiary support, and that the legal
contentions therein are warranted by existing law.  

 D is incorrect. This is a valid consideration because a party has the ability to request a more definitive statement in its
preanswer motion but not in its answer. This consideration could affect a defendant's decision whether to file a
preanswer motion under Federal Rule 12 or instead to just file an answer to the complaint that includes defendant's
defenses.

Question 1768 - Civil Procedure - Motions (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A shopper brought suit against a grocer in federal court for violation of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act. In
its pre-answer motion, the grocer raised the defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and lack of subject matter
jurisdiction. Thereafter, the grocer realized that it arguably had available to it the defenses of improper venue and
failure to join a party.  

 If the grocer files a second pre-answer motion raising these two additional defenses, should the court consider
them?  

A: Yes, the court should consider whether each defense is a valid defense to the case at bar. 
B: The court should only consider whether failure to join a party is a valid defense to the case at bar, but it should
refuse to consider the merits of the defense of improper venue. 
C: No, the court should refuse to consider either of the grocer's additional defenses as being a valid defense to the
case at bar. 
D: The court should only consider whether improper venue is a valid defense to the case at bar, but it should refuse to
consider the merits of the defense of failure to join a party. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

The defenses that must be presented in the first pre-answer motion, or if there is no pre-answer motion then in the
answer, or else they will be waived are: lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, insufficient process, and
insufficient service of process. The defense of improper venue must be raised in the first motion or else it is waived.
However, the defense of failure to join a party is not one of the defenses that is automatically waived and may be
raised by a later motion. Therefore, B is correct.  

 A is incorrect. Here the defense of improper venue should not be considered by the court because it was not raised in
the first motion and consequently will be waived.  

 B is correct for the reasons listed above.  

 C is incorrect. The defense of failure to join a party is not a defense which must be raised in the first motion and
therefore may be considered by the court in a later motion.  

 D is incorrect. The court should only recognize the defense of failure to join a party, not improper venue, which in this
case has been waived. 













Page 51

Question 1675 - Civil Procedure - Motions (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

An electrician from State A filed a diversity action against an actress from State B in federal Court in State A, alleging
that the actress failed to pay the electrician $150,000 due on a valid service contract to install a kitchen in the actress’
home. The actress disputed the contract's validity, testifying before the jury that the electrician installed the kitchen as
a gift and that exchanged emails referring to a "contract" had been in jest. During trial, the electrician's attorney
became increasingly concerned that the jury did not like his client.  

 What, if anything, should the electrican’s attorney do after the close of evidence?  

A: File a motion for judgment as a matter of law. 
B: File a motion for new trial on the ground of juror misconduct. 
C: There is nothing that the electrician's attorney can do at this point. 
D: File a motion for summary judgment. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is correct. The electrician's attorney should file a motion for judgment as a matter of law, in which he plausibly might
argue that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient basis to find that there had been no contract.  

 B is incorrect. Filing a motion for a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct would be premature; it can be made
only following the jury's verdict.  

 C is incorrect. It is not true that there is nothing the electrician's attorney can do. Instead, as A shows, the electrician’s
attorney may file a motion for judgment as a matter of law.  

 D is incorrect. Motions for summary judgment are pre-trial motions that are available only until 30 days after
completion of discovery.  












Page 52

Question 1678 - Civil Procedure - Motions (2/9/2017) 

The question was: 

A grocer from State A filed a diversity action against a supplier from State B in federal court in State B, seeking
$195,000 pursuant to a contract dispute. There was conflicting evidence as to whether there was a valid contract.
During the course of the trial, the grocer's attorney submitted a motion for judgment as a matter of law, which the court
ultimately denied. After the jury returned a verdict for the grocer in the amount of $1,500, the grocer submitted a
motion for judgment as a matter of law and an alternative motion for new trial.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The court must reject the grocer's motion for judgment as a matter of law because the jury found for the grocer. 
B: If the court rejects the grocer's motion for judgment as a matter of law, it also must reject the grocer's motion for
new trial. 
C: The court could both reject the grocer's motion for judgment as a matter of law, and grant the grocer's motion for
new trial. 
D: The court cannot grant the grocer's motion for a new trial because there was evidence for the supplier.  

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect.  The fact that the jury technically found for the grocer does not mean a Rule 50 motion for judgment as
a matter of law cannot be brought where, as here, the verdict returns substantially less than what the grocer sought.  

 B is incorrect. The fact that the jury found for the grocer does not mean that a motion for a new trial cannot be
brought where, as here, the verdict returns substantially less than what the grocer sought. A motion for a judgment as
a matter of law and a motion for a new trial have different requirements.  

 C is correct. Motions for judgment as a matter of law and motions for new trial have different requirements, so
circumstances can justify a court granting the latter but not the former. For example, there might be sufficient evidence
for a judge to deny a motion for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that a reasonable jury could find for the
other party (FRCP 50), yet a judge could grant a motion for new trial if she thought the jury's verdict was deeply flawed
(FRCP 59).  

 D is incorrect. A motion for new trial can be granted where the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, i.e., even
when the party against whom the motion is granted had some evidence to support her claim. 












Page 53

Question 1781 - Civil Procedure - Motions (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A buyer filed suit against a seller in federal court in State A. The federal district court entered a default judgment in
favor of the buyer. Within one month after entry of the default judgment, the seller made a motion seeking relief from
the judgment on the ground of excusable neglect. The seller made a prima facie showing that it had a meritorious
defense to the buyer's claim and that the buyer would not be unfairly prejudiced by the setting aside of the default
judgment. However, the record also showed that the seller had been served with the summons and complaint and
knew of the action in time to appear, plead or otherwise defend against it, but failed to do any of those things.  

 Should the court grant the seller's motion seeking relief from judgment?  

A: Yes, because the seller has demonstrated what is necessary to obtain relief from a default judgment: that its
motion is timely, it has a meritorious defense to the action, and the plaintiff would not be unfairly prejudiced by having
the default judgment set aside. 
B: No, because seller's failure to appear, plead or otherwise defend against the lawsuit does not constitute a form of
excusable neglect. 
C: Yes, because courts liberally grant relief from default judgments. 
D: No, but the court should set aside the entry of default. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. While all the matters noted in answer A are necessary for the seller to get a default judgment vacated
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60, they are not sufficient in this case because the seller knew of the
lawsuit and failed to appear, plead, or defend themselves in the lawsuit. Such action, as indicated in answer B, is not
a form of excusable neglect.  

 B is correct. Here the seller failed to take any action to the buyer's claim despite the seller's awareness of the suit
filed against him. Such behavior does not justify a court from relieving the seller from the final judgment entered
against him.  

 C is incorrect. Although it is true that courts tend to be more liberal in granting relief from default judgments (in
comparison to other judgments), the mere fact that the judgment is a default judgment does not entitle the seller to
relief. Here, the seller's conduct did not amount to excusable neglect.  

 D is incorrect. Entries of default can be set aside under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) only before a default
judgment has been entered. After that, relief is available pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 for, among
other things, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

Question 1672 - Civil Procedure - Motions (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A composer's wife filed a diversity action in State A federal court against an insurance company to recover insurance
proceeds pursuant to the accidental death provision of the composer's life insurance policy. The evidence shows that
the composer was last seen on a business trip seven years ago, that he has not been heard from since, and that his
body was never recovered. Under State A law, the party seeking recovery under an accidental death policy has the
burden of establishing the insured's death. The insurance company files a motion for summary judgment. In her
memorandum in opposition to the motion, the wife includes an affidavit that recites the evidence stated above and
adds "To my knowledge, my husband is dead."  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The court should deny the insurance company's motion because the insurance company has not met its burden of
showing that the composer is alive. 
B: The court should grant the insurance company's motion because the party opposing summary judgment cannot
establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact simply by means of an affidavit. 
C: The court should deny the insurance company's motion because the wife's affidavit establishes that there is a
genuine issue of material fact. 
D: The court should grant the insurance company's motion because the wife's affidavit is not made on personal
knowledge. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The insurance company does not bear the burden of showing that the composer is alive; because the
wife will have the burden of showing that the composer is dead at trial, she also bears that burden to defeat the
insurance company's motion for summary judgment.  

 B is incorrect. Federal Rule 56 specifically provides that an affidavit based on personal knowledge can be used to
support or oppose a motion for summary judgment.  

 C is incorrect. The wife's affidavit fails to establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the
composer's death because (1) the affidavit is not based on personal knowledge and (2) it does not provide any
admissible facts but merely recites her inference from the other evidence already in the record.  

 D is correct. Federal Rule 56 allows parties to augment the record by affidavits, but affidavits must be made on
personal knowledge. Here, the wife's affidavit is not based on the wife's personal knowledge, and the other pieces of
evidence are not sufficient to establish the existence of the element essential to the wife's case, namely that her
husband is dead.

Question 1666 - Civil Procedure - Motions (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A woman filed a diversity action against a man in federal court in State A, alleging that the man failed to pay a debt
due on a valid contract. The man has paid the debt, and has the cancelled checks to prove it.  

 What should the man's attorneys do?  

A: File a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, attaching an affidavit with the
cancelled checks. 
B: File an answer and then a motion for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit with the cancelled checks. 
C: File only a motion for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit with the cancelled checks. 
D: File a motion for judgment as a matter of law, attaching an affidavit with the cancelled checks. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The woman has stated a valid a claim in this case; it is simply a claim to which the man has a defense.  

 B is correct. The man has a valid defense, but it is not one of the defenses that can be asserted in a pre-answer Rule
12 motion to dismiss. Therefore, the man accordingly must file an answer. Because the man's defense relies on
material outside the pleadings, the man should file a motion for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit with the
cancelled checks.  

 C is incorrect. While a party may file a motion for summary judgment at any time until 30 days after the close of all
discovery, this does not prove to be the best course of action for the man's attorney.  

 D is incorrect. A motion for judgment as a matter of law is made at the time of trial, and there has not been a trial
here.

Question 1645 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (6/20/2016) 

The question was: 

Plaintiff, a citizen of State A, sues the State B corporation for which he works in federal district court in State B.
Plaintiff works in the corporation's factory located in State B, and his one-count complaint seeks damages of $125,000
for the corporation's alleged violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, a federal law that requires that higher wages be
paid for overtime work. The corporation files an answer with a single counterclaim, alleging that Plaintiff took $2,500
worth of the corporation's tools in violation of State A's wrongful conversion statute. Plaintiff then files a motion to
dismiss the corporation's counterclaim.  

 Will Plaintiff's motion to dismiss be granted?  

A: Yes, the counterclaim runs afoul of pleading requirements because it does not arise out of the transaction or
occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action. 
B: No, because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow permissive counterclaims. 
C: Yes, because the federal court does not have jurisdiction over the corporation's counterclaim. 
D: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over this properly pled permissive counterclaim. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Although crossclaims are subject to this limitation, (see Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(g)) Federal Rule 13(b) allows
permissive counterclaims, which need not bear any relationship to the subject matter of the original action.  

 B is incorrect. Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit permissive counterclaims (see Fed.R.Civ.P.
13(b)), this alone does not defeat Plaintiff's motion to dismiss.  

 C is correct. The corporation has properly pled a permissive counterclaim, but the federal court does not have
jurisdiction over it because there is neither diversity nor supplemental jurisdiction. There is no diversity jurisdiction
because the state wrongful conversion claim does not meet the $75,000 amount in controversy requirement. There is
no supplemental jurisdiction because the counterclaim is not "so related to claim in the action within such original
jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy." See 28 USC 1367(a).  

 D is incorrect. There is no supplemental jurisdiction because the counterclaim is not "so related to claim in the action
within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy." See 28 USC 1367(a).

Question 1721 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (6/27/2016) 

The question was: 

In federal court, a model filed suit against a photographer for breach of contract alleging breach of contract and asking
for damages. The sole defense available to the photographer was that he was a minor at the time he entered into the
contract. Under applicable state law, minors may not make enforceable contracts.  

 Which of the following is the photographer's best course of action?  

A: The photographer should answer the model's complaint, denying liability and, at trial, introduce evidence of his age
at the time he contracted with the model. 
B: The photographer should move to dismiss the model's complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted. 
C: The photographer should plead his age at the time he entered into the contract as an affirmative defense. 
D: The photographer should move for a more definite statement, requiring the model to allege, in her complaint, the
photographer's capacity to enter into an enforceable contract. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Incapacity to contract is an affirmative defense that will be waived if not timely raised. Although
incapacity to contract is not listed in Federal Rule 8(c), that rule is not exhaustive. The photographer's position
essentially is that even if everything the model alleges is true, the photographer is not liable because his minority
status rendered him incapable of entering into a binding contract. This is an affirmative defense. If the photographer
fails to plead the affirmative defense, the model could object to the photographer's evidence of his age at the time the
contract was made.  

 B is incorrect. Even though this defense is "absolute," a 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief
can be granted will not properly be granted if the photographer's age at the time of contracting did not appear on the
face of the complaint. There is no indication that it did so.  

 C is correct. Incapacity to contract is an affirmative defense that will be waived if not timely raised. Although
incapacity to contract is not listed in Federal Rule 8(c), that rule is not exhaustive. The photographer's position
essentially is that even if everything the model alleges is true, the photographer is not liable because his minority
status rendered him incapable of entering into a binding contract. This is an affirmative defense.  

 D is incorrect.  The model may not know whether the photographer had capacity to contract; the photographer is in a
better position to know that, and it's simply not necessary or particularly useful to require the model to make that
allegation. Also, the court might not grant the motion.

Question 1649 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (6/27/2016) 

The question was: 

A man, a citizen of State A, is the class representative of a valid class action lawsuit in federal court in State B against
a State B corporation. The lawsuit claims that the corporation breached the terms of its sales contract by failing to
notify consumers after the corporation became aware of certain problems with its product. The class representative
and the corporation agreed to settle the case, which would bind all members of the class and provide each member
with coupons worth $250 towards the future purchase of any product sold by the corporation. With a class of 100,000
members, the coupons' total value is $25 million, and attorneys' fees were set at 10% ($2.5 million).  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The class representative and corporation may, but need not, seek court approval of the settlement agreement. 
B: The court must allow absent class members to opt out of the settlement agreement. 
C: Attorneys' fees must be approved by the court, and this award will be approved. 
D: The court must hold a settlement hearing. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The Class Action Fairness Act ("CAFA") applies when (a) any class member is of diverse citizenship
from any defendant, (2) the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, and (3) there are at least 100 members in the
proposed class. Here, the elements for CAFA subject matter jurisdiction are met. The CAFA includes a number of
protections that apply to settlements in all class actions in federal court. One such protection concerns coupon
settlements. Pursuant to the CAFA, a court may only approve a coupon settlement after the court holds a settlement
hearing to ensure that the settlement is fair. Therefore, A is incorrect because it is not true that the parties need not
seek court approval for the settlement.  

 B is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure concerning class actions permit, but do not require the court to
afford class members an opportunity to opt-out of the settlement before the court approves the settlement. See
Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(4).  

 C is incorrect. CAFA provides that attorneys' fees may not be a percentage of the value of a coupon settlement;
instead, fees may be calculated on the basis of hours worked or may be a percentage of the value of the coupons that
are redeemed.  

 D is correct. The CAFA includes a number of protections that apply to settlements in all class actions in federal court.
One such protection concerns coupon settlements. Pursuant to the CAFA, a court may only approve a coupon
settlement after the court holds a settlement hearing to ensure that the settlement is fair.

Question 1642 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (6/27/2016) 

The question was: 

On June 1, 2012, a car manufacturer filed a lawsuit in federal court against a bolt manufacturer. The car manufacturer
uses the bolt manufacturer's bolts to secure the tires on the cars that it makes. The car manufacturer seeks
contractual indemnification for losses that the car manufacturer sustained from lawsuits concerning cars whose tires
detached during transit due to faulty bolts. State law provides a five-year statute of limitations for contract claims, and
a three-year statute of limitations for tort claims. Under state law, the statute of limitations for contractual
indemnification and tortious contribution lawsuits start to run when the car manufacturer first learns of the faulty bolts.
The car manufacturer first learned of the faulty bolts on August 1, 2009. Six months after filing its lawsuit, the car
manufacturer decided that it would like to also file contribution claim against the bolt manufacturer as a result of the
faulty bolts.  

 May the car manufacturer add a contribution claim?  

A: Yes, because the car manufacturer filed its lawsuit within the applicable five-year statute of limitations. 
B: No, because the car manufacturer did not file its contribution claim within the applicable three-year statute of
limitations. 
C: Most likely yes, because the car manufacturer's contribution claim relates back to the timely filed indemnification
claim. 
D: Most likely no, because the bolt manufacturer did not know, and should not have known, that the car manufacturer
would file a contribution claim against it. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The car manufacturer's contribution claim is subject to a three-year statute of limitations.  

 B is incorrect. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) the contribution claim relates back to the date of filing of the
indemnification claim, which was filed within the three-year statute of limitations, because the indemnification claim
arose out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out in the complaint. Therefore, it is not true that the car
manufacturer will not be able to add his contribution claim. Instead, the car manufacturer can most likely add the claim
but adding this complaint is contingent upon the car manufacturer getting the court's permission to amend its
complaint since more than 21 days has passed since the complaint was served upon the bolt manufacturer.  

 C is correct. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) the contribution claim relates back to the date of filing of the
indemnification claim, which was filed within the three-year statute of limitations, because the indemnification claim
arose out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out in the complaint. The car manufacturer can most
likely add the claim but adding this complaint is contingent upon the car manufacturer getting the court's permission to
amend its complaint since more than 21 days has passed since the complaint was served upon the bolt
manufacturer.  

 D is incorrect. The "knew or should have known" rule applies to changes of party, not to additional claims or defenses
asserted against existing parties.

Question 1738 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A valet brought suit against a bus driver in the federal district court of State A, alleging that the bus driver's negligent
driving had caused the valet injury. The bus driver denied negligence. In the course of discovery, the valet learned
that in the past ten years, the bus driver had been sued five times for negligent driving; all those suits, like this one,
involved allegations that the bus driver had "rear-ended" another driver’s car. All five plaintiffs had won verdicts. An
expert hired by the valet told the valet that psychiatrists had recently identified a syndrome in which certain persons
suffer an uncontrollable impulse to "bump" cars with their vehicle.  

 If the valet asks the judge to order the bus driver to submit to a mental exam, and supports her motion with
documents reflecting the above information obtained from the valet's expert, should the judge grant the valet’s
motion?  

A: Yes, because a mental exam involves no pain or suffering. 
B: No, because the bus driver did not place her mental state in controversy. 
C: No, because the bus driver’s past "rear endings" have no probative value as to whether the bus driver should be
held liable to the valet. 
D: Yes, because there appears to be good cause for the exam and the bus driver's mental state is in controversy. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The fact, if it is one, that a mental exam involves no pain or suffering, while relevant, is not a sufficient
reason to grant a mental exam in light of Federal Rule 35's requirements of good cause and that the condition to be
examined is "in controversy."  

 B is incorrect. It is not necessary that the bus driver have placed her mental state in controversy; another party can
do that.  

 C is incorrect. The bus driver's past "rear endings," and more particularly whether the bus driver suffers from
uncontrollable impulses to "bump" other cars with her vehicle, are relevant to whether she should be held liable to the
valet.  

 D is correct. The evidence of the bus driver's history of "rear endings" and the discovery of this syndrome put the bus
driver's mental state, in this regard, into controversy, and there is good cause for the exam given the relevance of the
evidence and the (apparent) absence of existing medical records on the matter of the bus driver's development of this
recently identified syndrome.

Question 1739 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

After the date for delivery had come and gone, a buyer sued the dealership that had promised to deliver to him, by
June 1, 2013, a new car meeting certain specifications. The suit was filed in federal court. The dealership timely
provided to the buyer the name, address and phone number of the dealership manager and of persons who worked at
the auto manufacturer who had information regarding the failed delivery. The dealership did not provide the name,
address or phone number of other persons who worked at the dealership who knew of the dealership's delay in
delivery because the dealership did not believe these individuals had additional discoverable information and the
dealership did not intend on calling these individuals as witnesses should the case proceed to trial. The buyer failed to
make a timely disclosure. The buyer then moved for an order compelling further disclosures from the dealership,
arguing that the dealership's initial disclosures were materially incomplete, and certifying that the buyer had, in good
faith, made attempts to confer with the dealership to obtain further disclosures without court action.  

 Should the court grant the buyer's motion to compel?  

A: No, because the dealership has no obligation to complete its initial disclosures until the buyer has made his own
initial disclosures. 
B: Yes, because the buyer's failure to make his own disclosures is no excuse for the dealership's failure to make
complete disclosure. 
C: No, because the dealership has no obligation to include in their initial disclosures information concerning
individuals who have discoverable information but whom the dealership does not intend to use in support of its
defenses. 
D: Yes, because the buyer's failure to make his own initial disclosures is no excuse for the dealership's failure to make
complete disclosure and the dealership breached its initial obligations in failing to identify the other persons who
worked at the dealership and who knew about the dealership's delay in delivering the car. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Federal Rule 26 requires parties to make initial disclosures to other parties without a discovery request.
Parties are not excused from making their initial disclosures because another party has not made their initial
disclosures. However, here, the dealership has not failed to complete their initial disclosures because a party is not
obligated to disclose information that the party does not intend to use to support its claims or defenses.  

 B is incorrect. Although this statement is true, parties are only required to disclose information that the party intends
to use to support its claims or defenses. Here, as the fact pattern indicates, the dealership does not intend to use the
information from the other persons from the dealership with information. Therefore, the dealership has not provided
incomplete initial disclosures and the court should not grant the buyer's motion to compel.  

 C is correct. Federal Rule 26(a) requires parties to disclose facts only about people whom the party intends to use to
support its claims or defenses. Here, as the fact pattern indicates, the dealership does not intend to use information
from the other persons that the dealership did not disclose.  

 D is incorrect. Although it is true that the buyer's failure to make his own initial disclosures is no excuse for the
dealership's failure to make complete disclosure, for the reasons stated above the dealership did not breach its
Federal Rule 26(a) obligations in failing to identify the persons whom the dealership did not intend to use in support of
its claims or defenses.

Question 1652 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A cyclist, a citizen of State A, sued a State B corporation with its principal place of business in State C that builds and
sells bicycles in federal district court in State C. The complaint asserted a single claim under State C products liability
law, alleging that the cyclist suffered in excess of $85,000 in damage to person and property when the wheel on his
bicycle detached in transit due to a defect in the bicycle's rear axle. The corporation purchased its rear axles from a
State A manufacturer. Concerned that any defects in the rear axle may have been the fault of the manufacturer, the
corporation wants the manufacturer to be part of the lawsuit.  

 What is the best course for the corporation's attorneys to follow?  

A: Move the court to order that the manufacturer be joined as a required party. 
B: Serve a summons and complaint on the manufacturer as a third party defendant. 
C: Join the manufacturer as a defendant under the federal interpleader statute. 
D: Nothing. The manufacturer cannot be joined in this lawsuit because doing so would destroy the court's diversity
jurisdiction. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The manufacturer does not qualify as a required party under Federal Rule 19 because the court can
accord complete relief without the manufacturer's presence, and resolution of the case would not, as a practical
matter, impair or impede the manufacturer's ability to protect its interests.  

 B is correct. The corporation can join the manufacturer in this suit as a third party defendant because the
manufacturer is or may be liable to the corporation for all or part of the cyclist's claim if the manufacturer is responsible
for the defective axle.  

 C is incorrect. These facts concern impleader, not interpleader; interpleader is available if two or more parties claim
legal rights in a specific piece of property.  

 D is incorrect. There would be supplemental jurisdiction over the corporation's claim against the manufacturer
because the claim is sufficiently related to the cyclist's claim in the action, thereby satisfying 28 USC 1367(a).

Question 1650 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A man, a citizen of State A whose pacemaker surgery was unsuccessful, sues the State B corporation that made the
pacemaker in State A federal court, seeking $125,000 in a single-count products liability complaint. The corporation
believes the surgeon who implanted the pacemaker committed malpractice. The state law that governs the claim
allows joint and several liability, and State A does not have personal jurisdiction over the surgeon.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The corporation can move the court to dismiss the action for failure to join a necessary party, and the court will be
required to dismiss the action. 
B: The corporation can move the court to dismiss the action for failure to join a necessary party, and the court will
have some discretion in determining whether to dismiss the action. 
C: The corporation will not be able to successfully move the court to dismiss the action for failure to join a necessary
party. 
D: The corporation can move the court to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction, because the court does
not have personal jurisdiction over the surgeon. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The Supreme Court has ruled that a potential defendant who might be jointly and severally liable is not
a necessary party for purposes of Federal Rule 19. Moreover, courts have some discretion whether to dismiss a suit
even in situations where a necessary party cannot be joined.  

 B is incorrect. The Supreme Court has ruled that a potential defendant who might be jointly and severally liable is not
a necessary party for purposes of Federal Rule 19.  

 C is correct. The Supreme Court has ruled that a potential defendant who might be jointly and severally liable is not a
necessary party for purposes of Federal Rule 19.  

 D is incorrect. The surgeon has not yet been made a defendant and therefore the corporation cannot make a motion
to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.

Question 1740 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

A patient who suffered from type 1 diabetes sought treatment at a local hospital. At the same time, a physician
employed by the hospital was doing laboratory research into diabetes and its effects on the human body. Some time
later, the patient died. The patient's estate then brought suit against the hospital for negligence in the patient's care.
The hospital retained the physician to work with its lawyers to prepare the hospital's defense. It later became clear to
the hospital's lawyers that the physician would not be a good witness, and they decided against calling him as an
expert at trial. Thereafter, lawyers for the patient's estate subpoenaed the physician for a deposition to inquire into the
laboratory research that the physician conducted prior to and after the patient's death. The hospital's lawyers objected
and moved to quash the subpoena.  

 Should the court grant the motion to quash?  

A: No, because the patient’s estate is entitled to disclosure of experts including their qualifications, their opinions to be
expressed, and the basis for those opinions. 
B: Yes, unless the patient’s estate can show exceptional circumstances under which it would be impracticable to
obtain facts or opinions by other means. 
C: Yes, unless the patient’s estate can show a substantial need for the material and undue hardship in obtaining it in
an alternative way. 
D: No, because the physician has nonprivileged information that is relevant to the patient’s estate for its claims or
defenses. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect because this is the general standard for discovery of a testifying expert. A party is entitled to disclosure
of experts including their qualifications, their opinions to be expressed at trial, and the basis for those opinions when
the expert is expected to testify at trial. Here, the physician will not be testifying for the hospital.  

 B is the correct answer. A party may depose testifying experts, those who are expected to be called at trial. However,
a party is not entitled to depose consulting experts, those who are retained in anticipation of litigation but who are not
expected to testify at trial. Disclosures from consulting experts are only discoverable upon a showing of exceptional
circumstances under which it would be impracticable for the other party to obtain facts or opinions by other means.
See Federal Rule 26(b)(4).  

 C is incorrect. This is the standard for discovery of work product. Work product of a party made in anticipation of
litigation is discoverable only upon a showing of a substantial need and undue hardship in obtaining the material in an
alternative way. When considering whether something falls under the scope of work product, the court may consider
who wrote the document, the content and context of the document, and the date the suit was filed. Here, the patient's
estate seeks to obtain information regarding the physician's research prior to and after the patient's death. This was
research the physician conducted prior to and outside of the hospital's litigation. Therefore, it cannot be said that the
physician's research qualifies as material produced in anticipation of litigation and thus would not qualify as work
product. Instead, the appropriate standard would be that regarding a consulting expert's opinion.  

 D is incorrect because this is the standard for discovery in general. The discovery of material from a consulting expert
requires a higher standard as stated above. 












Page 65

Question 1654 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

A man, a citizen of State A, files suit in federal court in State B as representative of a class against a State B
corporation, and thereafter files a motion to certify the class consisting of approximately 250 persons from across the
United States. The man claims that the corporation defrauded consumers under State B law by failing to refund taxes
it collected after State B reduced its sales tax. The man seeks compensatory damages of $77,000, though no other
member of the class is owed more than $100. The corporation urges the court not to certify the class.  

 What is the judge likely to do?  

A: Certify the class, because there is diversity jurisdiction since the man's claim exceeds $75,000 and the man and
the corporation have diverse citizenship. 
B: Not certify the class, because the man's claims are not typical of the claims of the rest of the class. 
C: Certify the class, because questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions
affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently
adjudicating the controversy. 
D: Not certify the class, because there is no jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act since the matter in
controversy does not exceed $5,000,000. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. There is diversity jurisdiction for this reason, but the existence of jurisdiction is not a sufficient basis for
certifying a class. The class certification requirements under Rule 23(a) are as follows: (1) it is impracticable to join all
members because the class is so numerous, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the named
party's interests are typical of the class, and (4) the named party will ensure the fair and adequate representation of
the interests of the absent members of the class.  

 B is correct. One of the requirements for class certification, as stated above, is that the named plaintiff's interests are
typical of the class. Here, this requirement is not satisfied because the man's damages of $77,000 are much greater
than the damage suffered by others in the class.  

 C is incorrect. These are not the only requirements that must be satisfied for a class to be certified. The fact that the
man's interests are not typical of the class (because the man's damages of $77,000 are much greater than the
damage suffered by others in the class) does not allow the judge to certify the class.  

 D is incorrect. It is true that the court lacks jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act for this reason, but the
court would have jurisdiction to hear this case under the diversity and supplemental statutes since the man and the
corporation are diverse and the man's amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. The obstacle to certification is not
jurisdiction, but Federal Rule 23's requirements.

Question 1720 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A plumber filed suit against a manufacturer in federal court in State A alleging that a widget negligently designed by
the manufacturer caused injury to the plumber. The manufacturer’s answer admitted that the manufacturer designed
the widget. Ten days after the manufacturer filed her answer, the statute of limitations ran on the plumber's claim. Five
days later still, the manufacturer filed an amended answer, denying that the manufacturer designed the widget that
injured the plumber. The plumber moved to strike the amendment to the answer.  

 Should the court grant the motion to strike the manufacturer's amended answer?  

A: No, the court should deny the motion to strike (permit the amendment to stand) because a court may only strike
redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous matter from a pleading. 
B: No, the court should deny the motion to strike (permit the amendment to stand) because the manufacturer may
amend her answer once "as a matter of course" within 21 days after it was served. 
C: Yes, the court should grant the motion to strike (strike the amendment) because the manufacturer is bound by all
admissions in the manufacturer's initial answer. 
D: Yes, the court should grant the motion to strike (strike the amendment) because the statute of limitations would
surely prevent the plumber from pursuing a claim against the true designer of the widget and the manufacturer lulled
the plumber into believing that he had sued the true designer of the widget that injured him. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Federal Rule 12(f) permits courts also to strike insufficient defenses, and courts strike pleadings for
reasons beyond those listed in Federal Rule 12(f).  

 B is correct. Pursuant to Federal Rule 15(a), a party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within 21
days after serving it. Here, 21 days had not yet passed since the manufacturer's service of its initial answer.  

 C is incorrect. The manufacturer is not so bound by admissions in her initial answer that it cannot correct erroneous
admissions, even without leave of court, within 21 days after service of the answer.  

 D is incorrect. The plumber can amend to add a claim against the true designer if the requirements of Federal Rule
15(c)(1)(C) are met.

Question 1727 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A firefighter brought suit against an entertainer in federal court even though the firefighter knew that he lacked an
evidentiary basis for a number of the allegations in the complaint against the entertainer.  In response to the
firefighter's complaint, the entertainer filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be
granted.  The entertainer then served a motion for sanctions on the firefighter.  Eighteen (18) days after the
entertainer's motion for sanctions, the firefighter withdrew his complaint.  The entertainer then filed a motion for
sanctions upon the firefighter with the court.  

 Should the court grant the entertainer's motion and impose sanctions on the firefighter?  

A: Yes, because the firefighter filed his complaint in bad faith and should be punished for such conduct. 
B: No, because the entertainer was required to file his motion for sanctions with the court prior to serving the
firefighter with the motion for sanctions. 
C: No, because it was improper for the entertainer to file a motion for sanctions with the court. 
D: Yes, because the mere filing of a complaint with no evidentiary support warrants that automatic sanctions be
imposed on a party. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Here, the firefighter timely withdrew his complaint after being served with the entertainer's motion for
sanctions (within twenty-one (21) days of the entertainer serving the firefighter with the motion for sanctions). Thus, it
was improper for the entertainer to file a motion for sanctions with the court.  

 B is incorrect. Pursuant to Federal Rule 11, a party wishing to file a motion for sanctions must first serve the motion
for sanctions on the opposing party. If the opposing party does not withdraw or correct the matter within 21 days, then
the moving party can file a motion for sanctions with the court. Therefore, B is incorrect because a party filing a motion
for sanctions is not required to first file his motion with the court.  

 C is correct. Pursuant to Federal Rule 11, a party wishing to file a motion for sanctions must first serve the motion for
sanctions on the opposing party. If the opposing party does not withdraw or correct the matter within 21 days, then the
moving party can file a motion for sanctions with the court. Here, the firefighter withdrew his complaint eighteen (18)
days after being served with the motion for sanctions. Therefore, it was improper for the entertainer to file a motion
with the court.  

 D is incorrect. Although parties have a duty to file pleadings and motions with good faith, when a party makes a timely
withdrawal of their bad-faith pleading after being served with a motion for sanctions, the party wishing to file a motion
for sanctions can no longer do so.

Question 1651 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

An athlete and a cyclist, both citizens of State A, jointly file a single lawsuit against a bike manufacturer, a State B
corporation, in federal court in State B. The complaint recites that the athlete was injured when the brakes of his
Model C bicycle failed to deploy. The athlete seeks $125,000 in damages. The complaint also recites that the cyclist
owns a Model D bicycle, and alleges that the manufacturer violated State A's fair trade act with misleading
advertisements for its Model D bicycles; advertisements stated the Model D bike weighs only 15 pounds, but the
cyclist's factory equipped Model D bike weighs more than 17 pounds. The cyclist seeks $98,000 in compensatory and
punitive damages. All relevant actions pertaining to the lawsuit occurred in State A, and the cyclist has never been to
State B.  

   Which of the following is the manufacturer's best option?  

A: File a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for misjoinder of parties. 
B: File a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, because there is not complete diversity of parties. 
C: File a motion to sever and order plaintiffs to bring separate lawsuits. 
D: File a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction over the cyclist. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Federal Rule 21 indicates that misjoinder of parties – what we have here – is not a ground for
dismissing the action.  

 B is incorrect. There is complete diversity of parties: both plaintiffs are from State A, and the manufacturer is from
State B. Complete diversity does not require that all plaintiffs hail from different states (or that all defendants come
from different states).  

 C is correct. The athlete and the cyclist cannot be co-plaintiffs because they do not satisfy Federal Rule 20's
requirement that co-plaintiffs must assert a right to relief jointly or assert claims that arise out of the same transaction,
occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.  

 D is incorrect. The cyclist has consented to State B's personal jurisdiction over him by filing the lawsuit in State B.

Question 1644 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A woman met with her doctor on January 1, 2005 for a consultation and description of the cosmetic surgery the doctor
would provide. The woman agreed to have the surgery on a date exactly one week later. Unhappy with the results, the
woman sued the doctor in federal court in a single-count complaint, filed on December 25, 2007, which asserts that
the doctor failed to obtain informed consent. Applicable state law provides a three-year statute of limitations for tort
claims. Two weeks after serving the complaint, the woman's attorneys amended the complaint to add a negligence
claim on the theory that the doctor was intoxicated while he performed her surgery.  

 Can the woman amend her complaint?  

A: Yes, because the negligence claim relates back to the date of the original complaint, which was filed timely, and
the woman can amend the complaint as a matter of right. 
B: No, because the negligence claim does not relate back to the original complaint. 
C: Yes, because the doctor knew or should have known that the woman would have brought a negligence claim
against him, but for a mistake. 
D: No, because the three-year statute of limitations for tort claims expired on January 1, 2008, and the woman did not
file the negligence claim before that date. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The woman's negligence claim does not relate back to the original complaint under Federal Rule 15(c)
because the doctor's alleged negligence during the operation did not arise out of the same conduct, transaction or
occurrence set out in the original pleading. The alleged failure to obtain informed consent concerned the doctor's
failure to adequately describe the risks and likely outcomes of the operation, while the negligence claim concerns his
performance during the actual operation. Therefore because the second claim does not arise out of the same
transaction or occurrence as the first claim, it cannot be added.  

 B is correct. The woman's negligence claim does not relate back to the original complaint under Federal Rule 15(c)
for the reasons set forth above.  

 C is incorrect. The "knew or should have known" requirement applies to amendments that add new parties, not to
additional claims against existing parties.  

 D is incorrect. This answer suggests that relation-back is never permitted. However, Federal Rule 15(c) allows claims
to be filed after the statute of limitations normally would have run when the requirements for relation-back are
satisfied.

Question 1746 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (2/9/2017) 

The question was: 

A baker brought suit against a restaurant in federal court. The baker's federal court case has been pending for five
years. Two weeks before the trial was to begin, the baker's attorney discovered a person whom she wished to call as
a witness at trial. There was no compelling reason why the baker's attorney had not discovered this person sooner;
the failure was simply due to an oversight by the investigator for the baker's lawyers. The district court already had
entered its final pretrial order. That order identified all of the witnesses that each side was to call at trial and all of the
documents that each side intended to offer into evidence. The newly discovered person was not listed as a witness in
the pretrial order. The baker's attorney thought that the newly discovered person could be important because his
testimony would corroborate the baker's testimony. The baker's attorney therefore moved the court to modify the final
pretrial order to permit the newly discovered person to testify.  

 Should the district court grant the motion to modify the final pretrial order?  

A: No, because it has no discretion to modify a final pretrial order once the order has been entered. 
B: No, because the baker has not presented circumstances that demonstrate that modification of the order is
necessary to prevent manifest injustice. 
C: Yes, because the philosophy of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is to freely grant leave to amend when justice
so requires. 
D: Yes, because even though the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure impose a high burden to justify modification of a
final pretrial order, the baker has shown justification for permitting the newly discovered person to testify. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The district court does have discretion to modify a final pretrial order, per Federal Rule 16(e).  

 B is correct. Under Federal Rule 16(e), the court should modify a final pretrial order only to prevent manifest injustice,
and that showing has not been made when the baker's attorney could have found this witness before the pretrial order
was entered and the newly discovered person appears to have testimony that will merely corroborate evidence that
will be presented by the baker.  

 C is incorrect. The described philosophy applies to the amendment of pleadings, not to the modification of a final
pretrial order.  

 D is incorrect. Here, the baker has not shown justification for permitting the newly discovered person to testify. Here,
the baker's attorney could have found this witness before the pretrial order was entered and the newly discovered
person appears to have testimony that will merely corroborate evidence that will be presented by the baker.

Question 1654 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A man, a citizen of State A, files suit in federal court in State B as representative of a class against a State B
corporation, and thereafter files a motion to certify the class consisting of approximately 250 persons from across the
United States. The man claims that the corporation defrauded consumers under State B law by failing to refund taxes
it collected after State B reduced its sales tax. The man seeks compensatory damages of $77,000, though no other
member of the class is owed more than $100. The corporation urges the court not to certify the class.  

 What is the judge likely to do?  

A: Certify the class, because there is diversity jurisdiction since the man's claim exceeds $75,000 and the man and
the corporation have diverse citizenship. 
B: Not certify the class, because the man's claims are not typical of the claims of the rest of the class. 
C: Certify the class, because questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions
affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently
adjudicating the controversy. 
D: Not certify the class, because there is no jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act since the matter in
controversy does not exceed $5,000,000. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. There is diversity jurisdiction for this reason, but the existence of jurisdiction is not a sufficient basis for
certifying a class. The class certification requirements under Rule 23(a) are as follows: (1) it is impracticable to join all
members because the class is so numerous, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the named
party's interests are typical of the class, and (4) the named party will ensure the fair and adequate representation of
the interests of the absent members of the class.  

 B is correct. One of the requirements for class certification, as stated above, is that the named plaintiff's interests are
typical of the class. Here, this requirement is not satisfied because the man's damages of $77,000 are much greater
than the damage suffered by others in the class.  

 C is incorrect. These are not the only requirements that must be satisfied for a class to be certified. The fact that the
man's interests are not typical of the class (because the man's damages of $77,000 are much greater than the
damage suffered by others in the class) does not allow the judge to certify the class.  

 D is incorrect. It is true that the court lacks jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act for this reason, but the
court would have jurisdiction to hear this case under the diversity and supplemental statutes since the man and the
corporation are diverse and the man's amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. The obstacle to certification is not
jurisdiction, but Federal Rule 23's requirements. 












Page 72

Question 1649 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A man, a citizen of State A, is the class representative of a valid class action lawsuit in federal court in State B against
a State B corporation. The lawsuit claims that the corporation breached the terms of its sales contract by failing to
notify consumers after the corporation became aware of certain problems with its product. The class representative
and the corporation agreed to settle the case, which would bind all members of the class and provide each member
with coupons worth $250 towards the future purchase of any product sold by the corporation. With a class of 100,000
members, the coupons' total value is $25 million, and attorneys' fees were set at 10% ($2.5 million).  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The class representative and corporation may, but need not, seek court approval of the settlement agreement. 
B: The court must allow absent class members to opt out of the settlement agreement. 
C: Attorneys' fees must be approved by the court, and this award will be approved. 
D: The court must hold a settlement hearing. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The Class Action Fairness Act ("CAFA") applies when (a) any class member is of diverse citizenship
from any defendant, (2) the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, and (3) there are at least 100 members in the
proposed class. Here, the elements for CAFA subject matter jurisdiction are met. The CAFA includes a number of
protections that apply to settlements in all class actions in federal court. One such protection concerns coupon
settlements. Pursuant to the CAFA, a court may only approve a coupon settlement after the court holds a settlement
hearing to ensure that the settlement is fair. Therefore, A is incorrect because it is not true that the parties need not
seek court approval for the settlement.  

 B is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure concerning class actions permit, but do not require the court to
afford class members an opportunity to opt-out of the settlement before the court approves the settlement. See
Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(4).  

 C is incorrect. CAFA provides that attorneys' fees may not be a percentage of the value of a coupon settlement;
instead, fees may be calculated on the basis of hours worked or may be a percentage of the value of the coupons that
are redeemed.  

 D is correct. The CAFA includes a number of protections that apply to settlements in all class actions in federal court.
One such protection concerns coupon settlements. Pursuant to the CAFA, a court may only approve a coupon
settlement after the court holds a settlement hearing to ensure that the settlement is fair.

Question 1728 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A novelist wished to file suit against an editor for an alleged violation of copyright law. The novelist's attorney, a recent
law school graduate, drafted and filed on behalf of the novelist, a complaint that purported to state a claim for relief
under copyright law but, unbeknownst to the attorney, did not state such a claim. The attorney did not recognize the
defect, so she did not request an extension or modification of existing copyright law or articulate any theory that would
have supported an extension or modification of existing copyright law. The editor first moved to dismiss the complaint
for failure to state a claim. Thereafter, the editor made a motion for sanctions claiming that the novelist's complaint
was filed in bad faith because the legal contentions contained in the complaint could not be warranted by existing law.
The novelist's attorney did not withdraw or appropriately correct the complaint for more than 21 days, and editor then
moved for sanctions. The court held that the novelist's complaint was made in bad faith.  

 Of the sanctions listed below, which would be most appropriate?  

A: The court should impose monetary sanctions on the novelist himself and require him to pay the editor all of the
reasonable attorney's fees directly resulting from the violation. 
B: The court should hold the novelist's attorney and the novelist jointly liable to the editor for all of the reasonable
attorney's fees directly resulting from the violation, including the fees incurred by the editor in drafting the motion for
sanctions and supporting memorandum. 
C: The court should dismiss the novelist's complaint with prejudice. 
D: The court should lecture the lawyer on the need to do careful legal research before filing a complaint or any other
legal document with the court and require her to take a course in copyright law, but should impose no other sanction
because no more is needed to deter repetition of the conduct at issue. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Federal Rule 11(c)(5)(b) states that monetary sanctions cannot be imposed on a represented party
when the legal contentions contained in the pleading or motion are not warranted by existing law. Therefore, the court
may not impose monetary sanctions on the novelist for his attorney's conduct.  

 B is incorrect. Federal Rule 11(c)(5)(b) states that monetary sanctions cannot be imposed on a represented party
when the legal contentions contained in the pleading or motion are not warranted by existing law. Therefore although
the court could impose monetary sanctions on the novelist's attorney, the court may not impose monetary sanctions
on the novelist himself.  

 C is incorrect. Prohibiting the novelist from bringing a corrected copyright claim would be the most severe sanction
available against the novelist. Here, the novelist is a relatively innocent party as the issue with the pleading was
created by the novelist's attorney. Moreover, this may go beyond the court imposing a sanction that should be "limited
to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct."  

 D is correct. The court has discretion to impose sanctions "limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such
conduct." Here, this would best be served by requiring the lawyer to take a course in copyright law and by lecturing
the lawyer to be more diligent in conducting legal research prior to filing a complaint.

Question 1731 - Civil Procedure - Pretrial Procedures (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A group of foreign-born employees, now living in State A, brought suit against their corporate employer from State B in
federal court alleging that the employer discriminated against the employees on the basis of their national origin and
had denied them promotions and pay raises at the company. The employees sought damages in the amount of
$100,000 to remedy the harms they believed they had suffered. The employer made a motion to join additional
parties, arguing that the American-born employees of the same origin should be joined to the case because their
interests will be impaired if they are left out. Some of the American-born employees that the employer wishes to join to
the case are from State B. The employer insists that if the American-born employees cannot be added then the
foreign-born employees' lawsuit must be dismissed.  

 If the court finds excluding the State B American-born employees from the suit would impair those American-born
employees interests, must the court dismiss the foreign-born employees' suit?  

A: Yes; the court must dismiss the foreign-born employees' suit because a court must dismiss claims when necessary
parties cannot be added. 
B: No; if the court determines that excluding the State B American-born employees would only impair and not
prejudice the American-born employees then the court does not need to dismiss the foreign-born employees' suit. 
C: Yes; the court must dismiss the foreign-born employees' suit because courts must dismiss suits when the exclusion
of a potential party to the suit would impair that party's interest. 
D: No; the court does not need to dismiss the foreign-born employees' suit because courts do not need to dismiss
suits even when indispensable parties cannot be joined. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. When parties to the suit cannot be joined, if the case can continue depends on whether the parties that
cannot be joined are necessary or indispensable. If the party that cannot be joined is necessary, meaning that their
interests will be impaired should they be excluded, then a court may still permit the original claim to go forward despite
the impairment to the party that could not be joined. However, if the party that cannot be joined is indispensable,
meaning that their interests would be prejudiced should they be excluded, then the court must dismiss the original
claim should these parties not be joined.  

 B is correct. Here, the State B American-born employees cannot be added to the suit because their presence in the
suit destroys diversity jurisdiction. However, the court need not dismiss the foreign-born employees' suit because the
American-born employees are not indispensable parties to the suit.  

 C is incorrect. When a party's interest to a suit will be impaired if they are not joined, that party is only a necessary
party, not an indispensable party, to the suit. Indispensable parties to a suit are those parties whose interests will be
prejudiced should they not be joined to a suit. Here, the State B American-born employees are necessary not
indispensable parties to the foreign-born employees' claim. Therefore, because the State B American-born employees
are not indispensable parties, the court need not dismiss the foreign-born employees' claim.  

 D is incorrect. A court must dismiss a suit when an indispensable party to the suit cannot be joined.

Question 1688 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

A biker filed a lawsuit against a driver in state court in State A, seeking compensation for damages incurred in a
collision. The driver defended on the ground of contributory negligence, a full defense under State A law. The jury
rendered a general verdict for the driver, thereby not identifying its specific findings. A doctor, who was also injured in
the same collision, subsequently filed a jurisdictionally valid diversity lawsuit against the driver in State A federal
court.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The driver will be precluded from relitigating the issue of his negligence on account of the final judgment from the
first lawsuit. 
B: The doctor will be precluded from relitigating the issue of the driver's negligence on account of the final judgment
from the first lawsuit. 
C: There will be no issue preclusion on account of the first lawsuit, but there may be claim preclusion. 
D: There will be neither issue preclusion nor claim preclusion on account of the first lawsuit. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The first lawsuit will have no issue preclusive effects on the second lawsuit because it is unclear, by
virtue of the general verdict, what issue the jury decided: they either could have determined that the driver was not
negligent or that the biker was contributorily negligent.  

 B is incorrect for the reasons stated above. Additionally, issue preclusion can apply only to a party or its privies, and
the doctor was neither a party nor in privity with any of the parties in the first lawsuit.  

 C is incorrect. The doctor's lawsuit cannot be subject to claim preclusion because he was not a party in, nor was he in
privity with any party from, the first lawsuit.  

 D is correct. The doctor's lawsuit against the driver cannot be subject to claim preclusion because he was not a party
in, nor was he in privity with any party from, the first lawsuit. 












Page 76

Question 1697 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (6/27/2016) 

The question was: 

A politician, from State B, filed a lawsuit against a stockbroker, from State A, in state court in State A, seeking over
$75,000 as compensation for damages incurred in a car accident. The jury found, pursuant to a special verdict, that
the stockbroker had not been negligent, and awarded no damages to the politician. Six months later, an assistant,
who also had been involved in the car accident, filed a jurisdictionally valid lawsuit against the stockbroker in federal
court in State A.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The assistant will be precluded from arguing that the stockbroker was negligent. 
B: The assistant will not be precluded from arguing that the stockbroker was negligent. 
C: The assistant's lawsuit will be dismissed on grounds of issue preclusion. 
D: The assistant's lawsuit will be dismissed on grounds of claim preclusion. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The assistant will not be precluded from litigating the stockbroker's negligence because the assistant
was not a party in the prior lawsuit; non-mutuality collateral estoppel cannot be asserted against someone who was
not a party in the first lawsuit – doing so would violate due process.  

 B is correct. Here, the assistant will not be precluded from arguing that the stockbroker was negligent because the
assistant was not a party in the prior law suit.  

 C is incorrect. As explained above, issue preclusion is not applicable to these facts and, furthermore, issue preclusion
is not a sufficient reason on its own for a lawsuit to be dismissed.  

 D is incorrect. Claim preclusion (res judicata) only applies to a party (or its privies) in the first lawsuit, and the
assistant was neither a party in the first case nor was he in privity with the stockbroker.  












Page 77

Question 1689 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A plumber filed a jurisdictionally valid diversity lawsuit against a dentist in federal court in State A, which applies
traditional contributory negligence principles, seeking compensation for damages incurred in a car accident.  The
dentist defended on the ground of contributory negligence.  After a four-day trial, the judge instructed the jury to issue
a verdict and also to answer two written questions: (1) Was the dentist negligent and (2) was the plumber
contributorily negligent?  The jury answered "yes" to both and returned a verdict in favor of the plumber, awarding him
damages of $95,000.  None of the parties filed any post-verdict motions.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The court must enter the jury's judgment. 
B: The court may enter the jury's judgment. 
C: The court may enter judgment for the dentist. 
D: The court must order a new trial. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Here, the jury has entered an erroneous verdict due to its inconsistent determinations. When this
happens, Federal Rule 49(b)(3) gives the court the choice among only three options: (1) to approve an appropriate
judgment according to the answers, notwithstanding the verdict, (2) direct the jury to further consider its answers and
verdict, or (3) order a new trial. Thus, A is incorrect because under these facts, the court does not have to enter the
jury's judgment.  

 B is incorrect. The court may not enter the jury's judgment for the reason stated above.  

 C is correct. The court may enter a judgment for the dentist for the reason stated above.  

 D is incorrect for the reason stated above. The court may -- but need not -- order a new trial. 












Page 78

Question 1699 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (6/28/2016) 

The question was: 

A driver filed a lawsuit against a car manufacturer in State A federal court on the theory that the car manufacturer
violated federal laws by having misleading advertising on its vehicles. A jury found, pursuant to a special verdict, that
the car manufacturer's advertisements violated the law and awarded the driver damages. A delivery man
subsequently filed a lawsuit against the car manufacturer in State B federal court, seeking damages on the same
theory put forward in the driver's lawsuit.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The car manufacturer will be precluded from relitigating the question of whether it violated the law, but only if State
A law permits non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel in these circumstances. 
B: The car manufacturer will be precluded from relitigating the question of whether it violated the law, but only if State
B law permits non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel in these circumstances. 
C: The car manufacturer will be precluded from relitigating the question of whether it violated the law, but only if
federal common law permits non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel in these circumstances. 
D: The car manufacturer will not be precluded from relitigating the question of whether it violated the law because the
delivery man was not a party to the first lawsuit. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The first case in State A was a federal question lawsuit because the driver was asserting a federal claim
against the car manufacturer. Federal law (more specifically, federal common law since there is no applicable statute)
governs the preclusionary effect of the judgment of a federal court that exercised federal question jurisdiction.
Therefore, federal law, not State A law, governs here. Furthermore, federal common law does not incorporate the law
of the state where the first federal court was located; incorporation of state preclusionary law is found only where the
first federal court was exercising diversity jurisdiction.  

 B is incorrect. Federal law, not State B law, governs here for the reasons stated in A, above.  

 C is correct for the reasons stated in A, above.  

 D is incorrect. This answer wrongly suggests that federal law does not permit non-mutual offensive collateral
estoppel. 












Page 79

Question 1785 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (2/3/2017) 

The question was: 

An artist brought a breach of contract claim against a museum in federal court. After the suit was filed, the artist never
sought discovery and did not make any motions. Two years after the suit was filed, the court dismissed the artist's
claim for failure to prosecute the action. The court's dismissal order did not address the effect of that dismissal. The
artist had not previously dismissed a lawsuit with the same claim prior to the court's dismissal of this action.  

 What effects will the dismissal order have?  

A: The dismissal will be without prejudice to the artist's right to amend her complaint, re-assert essentially the same
claim and prosecute the action. 
B: Because the artist had not previously dismissed a lawsuit including the same claim, she will be able to re-assert the
dismissed claim in a newly-filed federal court action. 
C: Since the court did not rule on the merits, the court's dismissal of the artist's claim will not operate as an
adjudication on the merits that precludes her from re-asserting the same claim in a newly filed action. 
D: The dismissal will operate as an adjudication on the merits that precludes the artist from re-asserting the same
claim in a newly filed action. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Here, the court entered an involuntary dismissal of the artist's claim for failure to prosecute her claim.
Involuntary dismissals are with prejudice.  

 B is incorrect. It makes no difference whether the artist has or has not, prior to the federal court's dismissal, already
dismissed a lawsuit that included the same claim. This mixes up rules concerning voluntary dismissals pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(B) with involuntary dismissals.  

 C is incorrect. Involuntary dismissals are dismissals with prejudice and do operate as an adjudication on the merits.  

 D is correct. Involuntary dismissals are dismissals with prejudice and, as such, the artist will not be able to re-assert
this same claim in a newly filed action.

Question 1783 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A zookeeper filed a breach of contract suit against a seller in federal district court in State A seeking $80,000 in
damages. The seller answered the zookeeper's complaint by denying liability. She also raised res judicata as an
affirmative defense because the zookeeper had a previous complaint against the seller arising out of the same
occurrence which had been dismissed without prejudice by the local state court. Each party conducted discovery.
Neither the seller nor the seller's attorney appeared at trial. At trial, the zookeeper introduced evidence that supported
his claim that the seller breached their contract and also supported consequential damages of $200,000.  

 Which of the following judgments should the court enter?  

A: The court should enter a judgment for the seller because the zookeeper failed to properly prosecute his case. 
B: The court should enter a judgment for the zookeeper for $200,000. 
C: The court should enter a judgment for the zookeeper, but only for $80,000 because this is the amount the seller
thought was at stake when she defaulted. 
D: The court should enter a judgment for the seller because when the zookeeper failed to reply to the seller's res
judicata claim, the zookeeper admitted that the federal suit was precluded. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. A court may file an involuntary dismissal for several reasons, one of which is a party's failure to
prosecute a claim. But here, nothing indicates that the zookeeper failed to prosecute his claim. Therefore, a court
would likely not enter an involuntary dismissal on this basis.  

 B is correct. The court should enter a judgment in this case because the seller failed to rebut the zookeeper's
evidence that supported a damages award of $200,000. Thus, a judgment for $200,000 is warranted.  

 C is incorrect because the seller answered the complaint. Under Federal Rule 55, the failure to show up for trial is not
a default. Here, the seller answered and rebutted the zookeeper's complaint so the seller did not default under the
Federal Rules with respect to the $80,000 in damages. However, the seller did not show up to trial and did not rebut
the evidence of $200,000 worth of consequential damages.  

 D is incorrect. The zookeeper was not required to reply to the seller's answer. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 8(b)(6), when a response is not required, the allegation is considered denied or avoided, not admitted.

Question 1686 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (2/8/2017) 

The question was: 

A writer from State A filed a jurisdictionally valid diversity action against an editor from State B in federal court in State
A, seeking $125,000 damages for a contract dispute. The writer's lawsuit was involuntarily dismissed because the
State A statute of limitations for the writer's claim had run. The writer then timely refiled the lawsuit in State B, which
has a longer statute of limitations. The editor then filed a motion to dismiss.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The writer's lawsuit in State B unquestionably should not be dismissed because it is not time-barred under State
B's statute of limitations. 
B: The writer's lawsuit in State B should not be dismissed, but only if State A law does not treat dismissals on grounds
of statute of limitations as an adjudication on the merits for purposes of res judicata. 
C: The writer's lawsuit in State B should not be dismissed, but only if State B law does not treat dismissals on grounds
of statute of limitations as an adjudication on the merits for purposes of res judicata. 
D: The writer's lawsuit in State B unquestionably should not be dismissed because involuntary dismissals operate as
an adjudication on the merits. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. This answer ignores the fact that there was a prior judgment (from State A) and its preclusive effect
must be analyzed; that the second lawsuit is timely under State B's statute of limitations is necessary but not sufficient
on its own for the State B lawsuit to go forward.  

 B is correct. The preclusive effect of a federal court's involuntary dismissal of a diversity lawsuit is determined, as a
matter of federal common law, by the law of the state in which the federal court that issued the dismissal is located.
Therefore, the writer's lawsuit may go forward in State B only if State A's dismissal is not an adjudication on the merits
under State A law.  

 C is incorrect. The preclusive effect of a federal court's involuntary dismissal of a diversity lawsuit is determined, as a
matter of federal common law, by the law of the state in which the federal court that issued the dismissal is located.
Therefore, it is State A's preclusionary law that matters, not State B's.  

 D is incorrect. The writer's lawsuit may go forward in State B only if State A's dismissal is not an adjudication on the
merits under State A law.

Question 1699 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A driver filed a lawsuit against a car manufacturer in State A federal court on the theory that the car manufacturer
violated federal laws by having misleading advertising on its vehicles. A jury found, pursuant to a special verdict, that
the car manufacturer's advertisements violated the law and awarded the driver damages. A delivery man
subsequently filed a lawsuit against the car manufacturer in State B federal court, seeking damages on the same
theory put forward in the driver's lawsuit.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The car manufacturer will be precluded from relitigating the question of whether it violated the law, but only if State
A law permits non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel in these circumstances. 
B: The car manufacturer will be precluded from relitigating the question of whether it violated the law, but only if State
B law permits non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel in these circumstances. 
C: The car manufacturer will be precluded from relitigating the question of whether it violated the law, but only if
federal common law permits non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel in these circumstances. 
D: The car manufacturer will not be precluded from relitigating the question of whether it violated the law because the
delivery man was not a party to the first lawsuit. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The first case in State A was a federal question lawsuit because the driver was asserting a federal claim
against the car manufacturer. Federal law (more specifically, federal common law since there is no applicable statute)
governs the preclusionary effect of the judgment of a federal court that exercised federal question jurisdiction.
Therefore, federal law, not State A law, governs here. Furthermore, federal common law does not incorporate the law
of the state where the first federal court was located; incorporation of state preclusionary law is found only where the
first federal court was exercising diversity jurisdiction.  

 B is incorrect. Federal law, not State B law, governs here for the reasons stated in A, above.  

 C is correct for the reasons stated in A, above.  

 D is incorrect. This answer wrongly suggests that federal law does not permit non-mutual offensive collateral
estoppel.

Question 1695 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A journalist, a citizen of State A, filed a lawsuit against a grocer, a citizen of State B, in State B’s state court, seeking
compensation for damages to his antique automobile incurred in a car accident in State B. A jury found that the grocer
drove negligently and awarded the journalist $95,000. Six months later the journalist filed a lawsuit against the grocer
in federal court in State B, seeking $125,000 for personal injuries the journalist suffered in the same car accident.  

 What will likely happen?  

A: The grocer will lose; he will be precluded from re-litigating the issue of his negligence under the doctrine of
collateral estoppel. 
B: The journalist will probably lose; he likely will be precluded from bringing this lawsuit under the doctrine of res
judicata. 
C: The grocer may not lose; though he will be precluded from re-litigating his negligence, he can litigate whether and
to what extent the journalist suffered personal injuries in the accident. 
D: The journalist may lose; he will be prevented from litigating in federal court unless he pleads facts that tend to
establish that the expected value of his claim exceeds $75,000. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. This lawsuit will not go forward, because the journalist will likely be barred from bring this law suit on the
ground of res judicata. Additionally, even if collateral estoppel were applicable, it would not mean that that the grocer
would automatically lose the case; the grocer would be precluded from re-litigating his negligence, but he still could
challenge whether and to what extent the journalist suffered personal injuries in the accident.  

 B is correct. The journalist likely will be barred from bringing this lawsuit on the ground of res judicata (also known as
claim preclusion) because there is an earlier final judgment between the same parties on the same cause of action;
the federal court will apply the preclusionary rules of State B, and under most states' laws claims for personal and
property damage suffered in a single car accident will be deemed to be part of a single cause of action.  

 C is incorrect. This lawsuit will not go forward, for the reasons explained immediately above; answer C would be
correct if the lawsuit were not barred by res judicata.   

 D is incorrect. Although diversity jurisdiction requires an amount of controversy of more than $75,000, there is no
such pleading requirement. 












Page 84

Question 1689 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A plumber filed a jurisdictionally valid diversity lawsuit against a dentist in federal court in State A, which applies
traditional contributory negligence principles, seeking compensation for damages incurred in a car accident.  The
dentist defended on the ground of contributory negligence.  After a four-day trial, the judge instructed the jury to issue
a verdict and also to answer two written questions: (1) Was the dentist negligent and (2) was the plumber
contributorily negligent?  The jury answered "yes" to both and returned a verdict in favor of the plumber, awarding him
damages of $95,000.  None of the parties filed any post-verdict motions.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The court must enter the jury's judgment. 
B: The court may enter the jury's judgment. 
C: The court may enter judgment for the dentist. 
D: The court must order a new trial. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Here, the jury has entered an erroneous verdict due to its inconsistent determinations. When this
happens, Federal Rule 49(b)(3) gives the court the choice among only three options: (1) to approve an appropriate
judgment according to the answers, notwithstanding the verdict, (2) direct the jury to further consider its answers and
verdict, or (3) order a new trial. Thus, A is incorrect because under these facts, the court does not have to enter the
jury's judgment.  

 B is incorrect. The court may not enter the jury's judgment for the reason stated above.  

 C is correct. The court may enter a judgment for the dentist for the reason stated above.  

 D is incorrect for the reason stated above. The court may -- but need not -- order a new trial. 












Page 85

Question 1697 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

A politician, from State B, filed a lawsuit against a stockbroker, from State A, in state court in State A, seeking over
$75,000 as compensation for damages incurred in a car accident. The jury found, pursuant to a special verdict, that
the stockbroker had not been negligent, and awarded no damages to the politician. Six months later, an assistant,
who also had been involved in the car accident, filed a jurisdictionally valid lawsuit against the stockbroker in federal
court in State A.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The assistant will be precluded from arguing that the stockbroker was negligent. 
B: The assistant will not be precluded from arguing that the stockbroker was negligent. 
C: The assistant's lawsuit will be dismissed on grounds of issue preclusion. 
D: The assistant's lawsuit will be dismissed on grounds of claim preclusion. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. The assistant will not be precluded from litigating the stockbroker's negligence because the assistant
was not a party in the prior lawsuit; non-mutuality collateral estoppel cannot be asserted against someone who was
not a party in the first lawsuit – doing so would violate due process.  

 B is correct. Here, the assistant will not be precluded from arguing that the stockbroker was negligent because the
assistant was not a party in the prior law suit.  

 C is incorrect. As explained above, issue preclusion is not applicable to these facts and, furthermore, issue preclusion
is not a sufficient reason on its own for a lawsuit to be dismissed.  

 D is incorrect. Claim preclusion (res judicata) only applies to a party (or its privies) in the first lawsuit, and the
assistant was neither a party in the first case nor was he in privity with the stockbroker.  












Page 86

Question 1687 - Civil Procedure - Verdicts and Judgments (2/10/2017) 

The question was: 

An accountant filed a jurisdictionally proper diversity lawsuit against a car manufacturer in State A federal court,
seeking compensation under a negligence claim for damages he suffered when the ignition of his car malfunctioned.
After the accountant obtained many documents and emails through discovery that indicated the manufacturer's
longstanding awareness of ignition problems, the manufacturer stopped participating in the litigation. Shortly
thereafter, the court issued a default judgment against the manufacturer. After the default judgment was entered, a
teacher filed suit against the car manufacturer in federal court in State B. The teacher seeks damages on the same
theory put forward in the accountant's lawsuit against the manufacturer.  

 Which of the following is true?  

A: The car manufacturer will be precluded from litigating the merits of its negligence in the teacher's case since there
was a default judgment against the manufacturer in the accountant's case. 
B: The car manufacturer will not be precluded from litigating the merits of its negligence in the teacher's case despite
there being a default judgment against the manufacturer in the accountant's case. 
C: Whether or not the car manufacturer will be precluded from litigating the merits of its negligence depends on
whether State A law permits non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel. 
D: Whether or not the car manufacturer will be precluded from litigating the merits of its negligence depends on
whether application of non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel on these facts would be unconstitutional. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. There can be issue preclusion only with respect to issues that were actually litigated and determined in
a previous lawsuit. Here, because the car manufacturer stopped responding in the accountant's suit, issue preclusion
does not apply here because the issues were not actually litigated.  

 B is correct. There will not be collateral estoppel because the issue of the car manufacturer's negligence was not
litigated and determined in the first case. Rather, the court issued a default judgment against the car manufacturer.  

 C is incorrect. Here, the car manufacturer will not be issue precluded regardless of whether State A law permits non-
mutual offensive collateral estoppel, there is no issue preclusion on these facts for reasons apart from non-mutuality.  

 D is incorrect. Here, the car manufacturer will not be issue precluded regardless of whether non-mutual offensive
collateral estoppel would be constitutional on these facts.

Question 659 - Constitutional Law - Individual Rights (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

The constitution of a state authorizes a five-member state reapportionment board to redraw state legislative districts
every ten years.  In the last state legislative reapportionment, the board, by a unanimous vote, divided the greater
metropolitan area, composed of a large city and several contiguous townships, into three equally populated state
legislative districts.  The result of that districting was that 40% of the area's total black population resided in one of
those districts, 45% of the area's total black population resided in the second of those districts, and 15% resided in the
third district.  

 A registered voter, who is black and is a resident of the city, brings suit in an appropriate court against the members
of the state reapportionment board, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that would require the boundary lines of
the state legislative districts in the greater metropolitan area be redrawn.  His only claim is that the current
reapportionment violates the Fifteenth Amendment because it improperly dilutes the voting power of the blacks who
reside in that area.  

 If no federal statute is applicable, which of the following facts, if proven, would most strongly support the validity of the
action of the state reapportionment board?  

A: In drawing the current district lines, the reapportionment board precisely complied with state constitutional
requirements that state legislative districts be compact and follow political subdivision boundaries to the maximum
extent feasible. 
B: The reapportionment board was composed of three white members and two black members and both of the
board's black members were satisfied that its plan did not improperly dilute the voting power of the blacks who reside
in that area. 
C: Although the rate of voter registration among blacks is below that of voter registrations among whites in the greater
metropolitan area, two black legislators have been elected from that area during the last 15 years. 
D: The total black population of the greater metropolitan area amounts to only 15% of the population that is required
to comprise a single legislative district. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct. Race cannot be the predominant factor in drawing the boundaries of a voting district unless the
district plan can survive a strict scrutiny review. Although the strange shape of a district is not necessary for strict
scrutiny to apply, a district's bizarre shape can be used to show that race was the predominant factor in drawing the
district's boundaries. Answer A provides the strongest support for the validity for the argument because it provides an
alternate reasoning for the redistricting in which race is not a predominate factor, and would not trigger strict scrutiny.   

 Answers B, C, and D fail to provide any evidence that race was not the predominate factor in redrawing the state
legislative districts. Answer B is not correct because the racial makeup of the reapportionment committee does not
indicate that race was not used to redraw the voting districts.  Answer C is incorrect because the racial makeup of
elected legislators does not indicate that race was not used to redraw the voting districts.  Answer D is not correct
because the small size of the black population does not indicate that race was not used to redraw the voting districts.
Thus, B, C, and D are incorrect.

Question 703 - Constitutional Law - Individual Rights (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

A state has a statute providing that an unsuccessful candidate in a primary election for a party's nomination for elected
public office may not become a candidate for the same office at the following general election by nominating petition
or by write-in votes.  

 A woman sought her party's nomination for governor in the May primary election.  After losing in the primary, the
woman filed nominating petitions containing the requisite number of signatures to become a candidate for the office of
governor in the following general election.  The chief elections officer of the state refused to certify the woman's
petitions solely because of the above statute.  The woman then filed suit in federal district court challenging the
constitutionality of this state statute.  

 As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following is the proper burden of persuasion in this suit?  

A: The woman must demonstrate that the statute is not necessary to achieve a compelling state interest. 
B: The woman must demonstrate that the statute is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. 
C: The state must demonstrate that the statute is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest. 
D: The state must demonstrate that the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  Candidate qualifications need to be narrowly tailored to protect a compelling state interest to not
violate equal protection or the First Amendment right of association, and the state has the burden to prove that its
regulation meets strict scrutiny.  Answer A is incorrect because for strict scrutiny, the burden is not on the individual,
but rather on the state.  Answer B is incorrect because rational basis would not apply, since a fundamental right is at
issue.  Answer D is incorrect because rational basis doesn't apply, and if it did, the plaintiff would have the burden
under it. 










Page 89

Question 260 - Constitutional Law - Individual Rights (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

While the defendant was in jail on a pending charge, his landlord called the police because rent had not been paid
and because he detected a disagreeable odor coming from the defendant's apartment into the hallways.  

 The police officer who responded to the call knew that the defendant was in jail.  He recognized the stench coming
from the defendant's apartment as that of decomposing flesh and, without waiting to obtain a warrant and using the
landlord's passkey, entered the apartment with the landlord's consent.  The lease to these premises gave the landlord
a right of entry, at any reasonable hour, for the purpose of making repairs.  The police officer found a large trunk in the
bedroom which seemed to be the source of the odor.  Upon breaking it open, he found the remains of the defendant's
former mistress.  

 If the defendant undertakes to challenge the search of his apartment, he has  

A: standing, because the items seized in the search were incriminating in nature. 
B: standing, because he still has a sufficient interest in the apartment even while in jail. 
C: no standing, because his landlord authorized the search. 
D: no standing, because he was out of the apartment when it occurred and had not paid his rent. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

B is the correct answer.  The defendant has standing because he still has a sufficient interest in his apartment even
while he is in jail.  He has not abandoned it or the property inside.  A is incorrect because the injury for standing has to
be to the expectation of privacy, not just to the damage the seized items could do.  C is incorrect because the landlord
could not waive the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.  D is incorrect because even though he was not there and
had not paid rent, he still had a privacy interest in the apartment.

Question 9 - Constitutional Law - Individual Rights (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

A state requires licenses of persons "who are engaged in the trade of barbering."  It will grant such licenses only to
those who are graduates of barber schools located in the state, have resided in the state for two years, and are
citizens of the United States.  

 The requirement that candidates for licenses must be citizens is  

A: constitutional as an effort to ensure that barbers speak English adequately. 
B: constitutional as an exercise of the state police power. 
C: unconstitutional as a bill of attainder. 
D: unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

D is the correct answer. Under the Equal Protection Clause, a state statute which uses alienage as a classification
must pass strict scrutiny. Here, the classification fails strict scrutiny because the state cannot prove that limiting barber
licenses to citizens is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest.  

   A is incorrect because there is not a sufficiently close correlation between citizenship and language proficiency to
satisfy strict scrutiny. B is incorrect because exercises of police power may not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. C
is incorrect because this is not a bill of attainder, which is a legislative imposition of punishment without a judicial
proceeding. 










Page 91

Question 1574 - Constitutional Law - Individual Rights (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

A clerical employee of a city water department was responsible for sending out water bills to customers. His work in
this respect had always been satisfactory.   

The employee's sister ran in a recent election against the incumbent mayor, but she lost. The employee had
supported his sister in the election campaign. After the mayor found out about this, she fired the employee solely
because his support for the sister indicated that he was "disloyal" to the mayor. The city's charter provides that "all
employees of the city work at the pleasure of the mayor."   

Is the mayor's action constitutional?  

A: No, because public employees have a property interest in their employment, which gives them a right to a hearing
prior to discharge. 
B: No, because the mayor's action violates the employee's right to freedom of expression and association. 
C: Yes, because the employee has no property interest in his job since the city charter provides that he holds the job
"at the pleasure of the mayor." 
D: Yes, because the mayor may require members of her administration to be politically loyal to her. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. A public employee has a property interest in his or her employment if the employee can be fired only for
cause. Because the city's charter provides that "all employees of the city work at the pleasure of the mayor," the
clerical employee does not have a property interest in his employment.   

Nevertheless, the mayor's action is unconstitutional, because it violates the employee's right to freedom of expression
and association protected by the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the government may not
fire an employee because of the employee's political views or affiliations unless certain political views or affiliations are
required for the effective performance of the employee's job. The political views or affiliations of a clerical employee of
a city water department are not relevant to the employee's job, and thus the employee may not be fired because of
them.   

B is correct. The mayor's action is unconstitutional, because it violates the employee's right to freedom of expression
and association protected by the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the government may not
fire an employee because of the employee's political views or affiliations unless certain political views or affiliations are
required for the effective performance of the employee's job. The political views or affiliations of a clerical employee of
a city water department are not relevant to the employee's job, and thus the employee may not be fired because of
them.   

C is incorrect. It is true that the employee has no property interest in his job, and therefore he is not entitled to the
constitutional protections  of  procedural  due  process.  Nevertheless, the  mayor's  action  is  unconstitutional,
because it violates the employee's right to freedom of expression and association protected by the First Amendment.
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the government may not fire an employee because of the employee's  political
views  or  affiliations  unless  certain  political  views  or  affiliations  are  required  for  the effective performance of the
employee's job. The political views or affiliations of a clerical employee of a city water department are not relevant to
the employee's job, and thus the employee may not be fired because of them.   

D is incorrect. The mayor may require members of her administration to be politically loyal to her only if political loyalty
is required for the effective performance of the job in question. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the government
may not fire an employee because of the employee's political views or affiliations unless certain political views or
affiliations are required for the effective performance of the employee's job. The political views or affiliations of a
clerical employee of a city water department are not relevant to the employee's job, and thus the employee may not
be fired because of them. The mayor's action is unconstitutional, because it violates the employee's right to freedom
of expression and association protected by the First Amendment.

Question 1341 - Constitutional Law - Individual Rights (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

The United States government demonstrated that terrorist attacks involving commercial airliners were perpetrated
exclusively by individuals of one particular race. In response, Congress enacted a statute imposing stringent new
airport and airline security measures only on individuals of that race seeking to board airplanes in the United States.  

 Which of the following provides the best ground for challenging the constitutionality of this statute?  

A: The commerce clause of Article I, Section 8. 
B: The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
C: The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV. 
D: The privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct. The U.S. Supreme Court held, in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), that the equal
protection principles of the Fourteenth Amendment apply to actions of the federal government through the due
process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The new security measures presumptively violate equal protection because
they contain a racial classification: the new security measures apply only to individuals of one race. A court therefore
would uphold the new security measures only if the government could prove that they are necessary to serve a
compelling public interest, a standard that the government typically cannot meet. Thus, Answer B is correct.  

 Answer A is incorrect. The commerce clause grants Congress plenary power to regulate the safety of air travel
because airlines are instrumentalities of interstate commerce.  

 Answer C is incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV prohibits actions by states that improperly
discriminate against the citizens of other states. The clause does not apply to actions of the federal government.  

 Answer D is incorrect. The privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from
depriving individuals of the privileges or immunities of United States citizenship. The U.S. Supreme Court has never
applied the clause to actions of the federal government.

Question 1424 - Constitutional Law - Individual Rights (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

A protester entered an IRS office during business hours. He denounced the income tax and set fire to pages from his
copy of the Internal Revenue Code. The fire was extinguished before it caused any other damage. The protester was
arrested and charged with violating a state law that prohibited igniting a fire in a public building. He claimed that his
prosecution was unconstitutional under the First Amendment.  

 May the protester constitutionally be convicted?  

A: No, because he was exercising his right to freedom of speech by burning a copy of the code. 
B: No, because the copy of the code belonged to him, and thus burning it did not infringe upon a legitimate
government interest. 
C: Yes, because the burning of the code was conduct rather than speech. 
D: Yes, because the state law is narrowly drawn to further a substantial government interest in prohibiting the
noncommunicative aspects of the act in question. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer D is correct. The protester's burning of the tax code qualifies as expressive conduct protected by the free
speech clause of the First Amendment because (1) the protester intended to communicate a message and (2) the
audience was likely to understand the communication. But because the state's interest underlying the law that the
protester violated (preventing the burning of public buildings) is unrelated to the message communicated by the
burning of the tax code, a court will not subject the state law to strict scrutiny. Instead, the court will uphold application
of the law to the protester if the law is narrowly tailored to further a substantial government interest, a standard of
justification that this law should satisfy easily. Thus, Answer D is correct.  

 Answer A is incorrect. It is correct that the protester's burning of the tax code qualifies as expressive conduct
protected by the free speech clause of the First Amendment. However, as stated above, the statue under which the
protester will be convicted is not aimed at curbing free speech. Thus, the mere fact that the protester engaged in an
act of free speech will not prevent a prosecution under the statute. Likewise, Answer C is incorrect. Regardless of
whether the protester's actions are characterized as conduct or speech, the applicable statute in this case is not
designed to deter free speech.  

 Answer B is incorrect. The legitimacy (and substantiality) of the government's interest in preventing the burning of
public buildings is not undermined by the fact that the protester burned his own copy of the tax code.

Question 463 - Constitutional Law - Individual Rights (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

According to a state statute, a candidate for state office may have his name placed on the official election ballot only if
he files a petition with the appropriate state official containing a specified number of voter signatures.  A politician
failed to get his name placed on the state ballot as an independent candidate for governor because he failed to file a
petition with the number of voter signatures required by state statute.  In a suit against the appropriate state official in
federal district court, the politician sought an injunction against signature requirement on the ground that it was
unconstitutional.  

 Which of the following, if established, constitutes the strongest argument for the politician?  

A: Compliance with the petition signature requirement is burdensome. 
B: The objectives of the statute could be satisfactorily achieved by less burdensome means. 
C: Because of the petition signature requirement, very few independent candidates have ever succeeded in getting on
the ballot. 
D: The motivation for the statute was a desire to keep candidates off the ballot if they did not have strong support
among voters. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

B is the correct answer.  Regulations on access to the ballot must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling
governmental interest.  Therefore, if the objectives of the statute could be satisfactorily achieved by less burdensome
means, the statute is not narrowly tailored.  

 A is incorrect because a statute may be burdensome and still pass heightened scrutiny as long as it is narrowly
tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest.  C is incorrect because the fact that fewer candidates from
one political party make it onto the ballot is irrelevant if the requirement is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling
government interest.  D is incorrect because limiting the ballot to only those candidates who have strong support
might be a compelling government interest. 










Page 95

Question 307 - Constitutional Law - Judicial Review (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

As part of a comprehensive federal aid-to-education program, Congress included the following provisions as
conditions for state receipt of federal funds:  (1) Whenever textbooks are provided to students without charge, they
must include no religious instruction and must be made available on the same terms to students in all public and
private schools accredited by the state educational authority.  (2) Salary supplements can be paid to teachers in public
and private schools, up to ten percent of existing salary schedules, where present compensation is less than the
average salary for persons of comparable training and experience, provided that no such supplement is paid to any
teacher who instructs in religious subjects.  (3) Construction grants can be made toward the cost of physical plant at
private colleges and universities, provided that no part of the grant is used for buildings in which instruction in religious
subject matters is offered.  

 A federal taxpayer challenges the provision that allows the distribution of free textbooks to students in a private
school where religious instruction is included in the curriculum.  On the question of the adequacy of the taxpayer's
standing to raise the constitutional question, the most likely result is that standing will be  

A: sustained, because any congressional spending authorization can be challenged by any taxpayer. 
B: sustained, because the challenge to the exercise of congressional spending power is based on a claimed violation
of specific constitutional limitations on the exercise of such power. 
C: denied, because there is insufficient nexus between the taxpayer and the challenged expenditures. 
D: denied, because, in the case of private schools, no state action is involved. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

B is the correct answer. While taxpayers generally lack standing to challenge general spending statutes, a tax payer
will have standing where the spending violates the Establishment Clause. Because the taxpayer is alleging that the
provision is advancing religion, there is a possible violation of a specific limitation on Congressional spending and the
taxpayer will have standing. A is incorrect because taxpayers generally do not have standing to challenge
governmental expenditures. C is incorrect because in the case of Establishment Clause challenges, the taxpayer does
not need to show a special nexus in order to have standing. D is incorrect because the distribution of books paid for
by federal funds is state action.

Question 121 - Constitutional Law - Relations Between Federal and State Governments (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

In an effort to relieve serious and persistent unemployment in an industrialized state, its legislature enacted a statute
requiring every business with annual sales in the state of over one million dollars to purchase goods and/or services in
the state equal in value to at least half of the annual sales in the state of the business.  Which of the following
constitutional provisions is the strongest basis on which to attack this statute?  

A: The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 
B: The equal protection clause 
C: The commerce clause 
D: The privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 

The explanation for the answer is: 

C is the correct answer. By requiring certain businesses to spend a certain amount of money within the state, the state
is impairing interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause. A is incorrect because since there is no
fundamental right at stake, the statute would only have to pass rational basis review, and requiring a certain amount of
intrastate spending is rationally related to easing unemployment, which is a legitimate state interest. Likewise, B is
incorrect since wealth is not a suspect classification and would only trigger a rational basis review. D is incorrect
because the statute does not implicate any rights or privileges of national citizenship.

Question 589 - Constitutional Law - Relations Between Federal and State Governments (6/19/2016) 

The question was: 

An interstate bus company operates in a five-state area.  A federal statute authorizes the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC) to permit interstate carriers to discontinue entirely any unprofitable route.  The interstate bus
company applied to the ICC for permission to drop a very unprofitable route through the sparsely populated Shaley
Mountains.  The ICC granted that permission even though the interstate bus company provided the only public
transportation into the region.  

 A man is the owner of a mountain resort in the Shaley Mountains, whose customers usually arrived on vehicles
operated by the interstate bus company.  After exhausting all available federal administrative remedies, the man filed
suit against the interstate bus company in the trial court of the state in which the Shaley Mountains are located to
enjoin the discontinuance by the interstate bus company of its service to that area.  The man alleged that the
discontinuance of service by the interstate bus company would violate a statute of that state prohibiting common
carriers of persons from abandoning service to communities having no alternate form of public transportation.  

 The state court should  

A: dismiss the action, because the man lacks standing to sue. 
B: direct the removal of the case to federal court, because this suit involves a substantial federal question. 
C: hear the case on its merits and decide for the man because, on these facts, a federal agency is interfering with
essential state functions. 
D: hear the case on its merits and decide for the interstate bus company, because a valid federal law preempts the
state statute on which the man relies. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

D is the correct answer.  The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution requires that where a state law
conflicts with a valid federal law, the federal law preempts that state law.  And because regulating interstate carriers is
within Congress's commerce clause power, the federal law is valid.  Answer A is incorrect because the man has
standing.  He has an injury to his business that was caused by the federal action, and prohibiting the discontinuance
would remedy his injury.  Answer B is incorrect because states have concurrent jurisdiction to decide federal
questions, since state courts are courts of general jurisdiction.  Answer C is incorrect because regulating interstate
common carriers is not an essential state function; rather, it is a quintessential federal function.

Question 235 - Constitutional Law - Relations Between Federal and State Governments (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

Congress provides by statute that any state that fails to prohibit automobile speeds of over 55 miles per hour on
highways within the state shall be denied all federal highway construction funding.  One of the richest and most
highway-oriented states in the country refuses to enact such a statute.  

 The federal statute relating to disbursement of highway funds conditioned on the 55 mile-an-hour speed limit is
probably  

A: unconstitutional. 
B: constitutional only on the basis of the spending power. 
C: constitutional only on the basis of the commerce power. 
D: constitutional on the basis of both the spending power and the commerce power. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

D is the correct answer. Under the Commerce Clause, Congress may regulate the channels of interstate commerce,
which would include the federal highway system. Additionally, Congress may regulate through spending as long as
there is a nexus between the general welfare, the imposed condition, and the purpose of the federal funds. A speed
limit of 55 miles per hour is reasonably related to highway safety, and the funds are for highway repair. Therefore, the
statute is constitutional under both powers.   

   A is incorrect because the statute is constitutional. B is incorrect because the Commerce Clause gives Congress
broad power to regulate federal highways, a means of interstate commerce. C is incorrect because the spending
power gives Congress broad power to determine how federal funds are spent for the general welfare.   










Page 99

Question 139 - Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

The Federal Automobile Safety Act established certain safety and performance standards for all automobiles
manufactured in the United States.  The Act creates a five-member "Automobile Commission" to investigate
automobile safety, to make recommendations to Congress for new laws, to make further rules establishing safety and
performance standards, and to prosecute violations of the act.  The chairman is appointed by the President, two
members are selected by the President pro tempore of the Senate, and two by the Speaker of the House of
Representatives.  

 A minor United States car manufacturer seeks to enjoin enforcement of the Commission's rules.  

 The best argument that the car manufacturer can make is that  

A: legislative power may not be delegated by Congress to an agency in the absence of clear guidelines. 
B: the commerce power does not extend to the manufacture of automobiles not used in  interstate commerce. 
C: the car manufacturer is denied due process of law because it is not represented on the Commission. 
D: the Commission lacks authority to enforce its standards because not all of its members were appointed by the
President. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

D is the correct answer. Congress has the power to create agencies and to delegate power to those agencies.
However, Congress cannot appoint members of a body with administrative or enforcement powers. Since
enforcement is an executive power, the fact that some of the commission is appointed by Congress voids that power.
Thus, the best argument the car manufacturer has is that the appointments by Congress would prohibit the
Commission from being able to enforce its standards.  

   A is incorrect because Congress can delegate legislative power, and the statute provides sufficient guidelines to the
Commission. B is incorrect because the commerce power would clearly reach the manufacture of automobiles, which
are in the stream of interstate commerce. C is incorrect because business regulations will almost always be upheld,
and representation on the Commission is not required. 











Page 100

Question 1491 - Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

Congress passed a statute providing that parties could no longer seek review in the U.S. Supreme Court of final
judgments in criminal matters made by the highest court in each state.   

 What is the best argument supporting the constitutionality of the statute?  

A: Congress has the power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. 
B: Criminal matters are traditionally governed by state law. 
C: The proper means of federal judicial review of state criminal matters is by habeas corpus. 
D: The review of state court judgments is not within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct. The text of the exceptions clause of Article III does not limit congressional power to strip the U.S.
Supreme Court of its appellate jurisdiction to hear particular types of cases, and the Court's own decisions arguably
support the view that the exceptions clause grants Congress this power. Thus, Answer A is correct.  

 Answer B is incorrect. While it is true that criminal matters are traditionally governed by state law, a decision of the
highest court of a state in a criminal case is subject to appellate review in the U.S. Supreme Court if the case includes
a claim arising under federal law or if the case otherwise is within the federal judicial power.  

 Answer C is incorrect. A habeas corpus petition is not a means of direct federal judicial review of a state criminal case
but rather constitutes a separate civil suit for the release of a prisoner who has been unlawfully imprisoned.  

 Answer D is incorrect. While it is true that the review of state court judgments is not within the original jurisdiction of
the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court can review such judgments by exercising its appellate jurisdiction.

Question 592 - Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers (2/3/2017) 

The question was: 

A federal statute prohibits the construction of nuclear energy plants without a license from the Federal Nuclear Plant
Siting Commission.  The statute provides that the Commission may issue a license authorizing the construction of a
proposed nuclear energy plant 30 days after the Commission makes a finding that the plant will comply with specified
standards of safety, technological and commercial feasibility, and public convenience.  In a severable provision, the
Commission's enabling statute also provides that the Congress, by simple majorities in each house, may veto the
issuance of a particular license by the Commission if such a veto occurs within 30 days following the required
Commission finding.  

 Early last year, the Commission found that a particular energy company, met all statutory requirements and,
therefore, voted to issue the energy company a license authorizing it to construct a nuclear energy plant.   Because
they believed that the issuance of a license to the energy company was not in accord with the applicable statutory
criteria, a majority of each of the two houses of Congress voted, within the specified 30-day period, to veto the license.
On the basis of that veto, the Commission refused to issue the license.  Subsequently, the energy company sued the
Commission in an appropriate federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the Commission's refusal to
issue the license.  

 In this suit, the court should hold the congressional veto of the license of the energy company to be  

A: invalid, because any determination by Congress that particular agency action does not satisfy statutory criteria
violates Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution because it constitutes the performance of a judicial function by the
legislative branch. 
B: invalid, because Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution has been interpreted to mean that any action of Congress
purporting to alter the legal rights of persons outside of the legislative branch must be presented to the President for
his signature or veto. 
C: valid, because Congress has authority under the commerce clause to regulate the construction of nuclear energy
plants. 
D: valid, because there is a compelling national interest in the close congressional supervision of nuclear plant siting
in light of the grave dangers to the public health and safety that are associated with the operation of such plants. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  Article I, § 7, cl. 3 of the United States Constitution provides that any matter that the houses of
Congress can accomplish by majority vote must be presented to the President for signature or veto before it can have
effect.  As part of our system of checks and balances, Congress can act alone, without the assistance of the
Executive Branch when the Constitution allows it, and the Constitution allows Congress to act alone only when it can
command a super-majority.  

 Answer A is incorrect because Congress isn't reviewing the decision of the agency; rather, Congress is part of the
system deciding whether to issue the license at all.  Answer C is incorrect because, although Congress does have
authority under the Commerce clause to regulate the construction of nuclear energy plants, its action in acting by
majority vote alone was not valid.  Similarly, answer D is incorrect because Congress may have a compelling interest
in regulating nuclear siting for public health and safety, but its actions were invalid because it cannot act alone without
a super-majority.  Additionally, Congress would not have needed a compelling state interest to regulate nuclear siting,
because the facts present no deprivation of a fundamental right or classification based on a protected class.

Question 897 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties (7/23/2016) 

The question was: 

A flour wholesaler contracted to deliver to a producer of fine baked goods her flour requirements for a one-year
period.  Before delivery of the first scheduled installment, the flour wholesaler sold its business and "assigned" all of its
sale contracts to Miller, Inc., another reputable and long-time flour wholesaler.  The original flour wholesaler informed
the baked goods producer of this transaction.  

 Assume that the baked goods producer accepted Miller's delivery of the first installment under the flour wholesaler-
baked goods producer contract, but that the baked goods producer paid the contract price for that installment to the
flour wholesaler and refused to pay anything to Miller.  

 In an action by Miller against the baked goods producer for the contractual amount of the first installment, which of
the following, if any, will be an effective defense for the baked goods producer?  

A: The baked goods producer had not expressly agreed to accept Miller as her flour supplier. 
B: The baked goods producer's payment of the contractual installment to the flour wholesaler discharged her
obligation. 
C: The flour wholesaler remained obligated to the baked goods producer even though the flour wholesaler had
assigned the contract to Miller. 
D: None of the above.  

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer D is correct.  Under the UCC, a party may perform his duty through a delegatee unless the other party has a
substantial interest in having the original party perform the contract.  In other words, performance of the contract by
the delegatee ordinarily does not require the assent of the other party to the contract.  Because Miller is comparable to
the flour wholesaler in terms of reputation and experience, the baked goods producer should not have a particular
interest in having the flour wholesaler perform the contract.  When the flour wholesaler sold its business and assigned
its contracts of sale to Miller, the baked goods producer's agreement to the delegation was not necessary.  Therefore
A is incorrect.  

 B is incorrect because, once the other party to the contract (the baked goods producer) has received notice of an
assignment of rights, she can discharge her obligation only upon payment to the assignee (Miller).  Payment to the
assignor will not discharge the obligation.  C is incorrect because even though the flour wholesaler is obligated to the
baked goods producer, as the obligor the baked good producer must make payment to the delegatee, not the
delegator.

Question 813 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

Under the terms of a written contract, a builder agreed to construct for a homeowner a garage for $10,000.  Nothing
was said in the parties' negotiations or in the contract about progress payments during the course of the work.  

 After completing 25% of the garage strictly according to the homeowner's specifications, the builder assigned his
rights under the contract to a bank as security for an $8,000 loan.  The bank immediately notified the homeowner of
the assignment.  The builder thereafter, without legal excuse, abandoned the job before it was half-complete.  The
builder subsequently defaulted on the loan from the bank.  The builder has no assets.  It will cost the homeowner at
least $8,000 to get the garage finished by another builder.  

 If the bank sues the homeowner for $8,000, which of the following will the court decide?  

A: The bank wins, because the builder-homeowner contract was in existence and the builder was not in breach when
the bank gave the homeowner notice of the assignment. 
B: The bank wins, because the bank as a secured creditor over the builder is entitled to priority over the homeowner's
unsecured claim against the builder. 
C: The homeowner wins, because his right to recoupment on account of the builder's breach is available against the
bank as the builder's assignee. 
D: The homeowner wins, because his claim against the builder arose prior to the builder's default on his loan from the
bank. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  When contract rights are assigned, the assignee acquires a right against the obligor only to the
extent that the obligor is under a duty to the assignor.  In other words, the assignee acquires no greater rights against
the obligor than the assignor had.  When the builder (assignor) assigned his contract right to the bank (assignee), the
bank's right to payment remained subject to any defense that the homeowner (obligor) could raise against the builder.
Therefore, the builder's material breach of the construction contract is a defense that the homeowner can raise
against the bank.  

 Answer A is incorrect because the bank's rights remain vulnerable to any defense that the homeowner can raise,
regardless of whether the facts giving rise to the defense occur after the assignment or after the bank gives notice of
the assignment.  Answer B is incorrect because the rights the bank acquired are subject to the same defenses that
the builder's were.  Answer D is incorrect because the bank's status as the builder's creditor is irrelevant to whether
the homeowner can raise the defense of the builder's breach against the bank.

Question 180 - Contracts - Assignment of Rights and Delegation of Duties (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A painter, who has been in the painting business for ten years and has a fine reputation, contracts to paint a farmer's
barn.  The farmer's barn is a standard red barn with a loft.  The contract has no provision regarding assignment.  

 If the painter assigns the contract to a contractor, who has comparable experience and reputation, which of the
following statements is correct?  

A: The painter is in breach of contract. 
B: The farmer may refuse to accept performance by the contractor. 
C: The farmer is required to accept performance by the contractor. 
D: There is a novation. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct. Unless the contract provides otherwise, a contractual duty may be delegated to another unless
the other party to the contract has a substantial interest in having the original obligor perform. Typically the other party
will have a substantial interest where the contract is a personal services contract involving aesthetic taste and
judgment. Although the painter-farmer contract is one for personal services (painting), the item to be painted is a
standard barn and the work will be done by a painter of comparable experience and reputation. Therefore, the
painter's delegation of the duty was not a breach, even if it was done without the consent of the farmer, and if the
farmer refuses performance by the contractor, he will be in breach of contract. A and B are thus incorrect. D is
incorrect because the mere delegation of a duty, does not create a novation; a novation would require an express
agreement by all parties to substitute the contractor for the painter.    









Page 105

Question 395 - Contracts - Conditions (7/23/2016) 

The question was: 

On March 31, a seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement in which the seller agreed to fabricate and sell to
the buyer 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by the buyer.  The
contract provided that the buyer would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give the seller funds to
"tool up" for the work; that the seller would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that the buyer would pay the
balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that the seller would deliver the balance of the brake linings on June
30.  

 On May 10, the seller notified the buyer that it was doubtful whether the seller could perform because of problems
encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings.  On May 15, however, the seller
assured the buyer that the production difficulties had been overcome, and the buyer paid the seller the first 50 percent
installment of the purchase price.  The seller did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on May 31, or at any time
thereafter; and on June 10, the seller notified that it would not perform the contract.  

 Which of the following is NOT a correct statement of the parties' legal status immediately after the seller's notice on
June 10?  

A: The buyer has a cause of action for total breach of contract because of the seller's repudiation, but that cause of
action will be lost if the seller retracts its repudiation before the buyer changes its position or manifests to the seller
that the buyer considers the repudiation final. 
B: The buyer can bring suit to rescind the contract even if it elects to await the seller's performance for a commercially
reasonable time. 
C: The buyer can await performance by the seller for a commercially reasonable time, but if the buyer awaits
performance beyond that period, it cannot recover any resulting damages that it reasonably could have avoided. 
D: The buyer has a cause of action for breach of contract that it can successfully assert only after it has given the
seller a commercially reasonable time to perform. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer D is correct.  Under the UCC, when either party repudiates a contract for the sale of goods with respect to a
performance whose loss will substantially affect the value of the contract, the non-repudiating party may await
performance for a commercially reasonable time or immediately resort to remedies for breach of contract.  The non-
repudiating party, however, may not recover damages that he might have mitigated with reasonable effort.  The
repudiating party is still free to retract its repudiation unless the non-repudiating party has relied on it or otherwise
indicated that he considers the repudiation final. The seller's June 10 statement that it would not perform the contract,
when read in light of its earlier communications and failure to make a delivery when due, amounts to a repudiation that
gives the buyer the right to bring immediate action for breach. Therefore, D is the correct answer choice because the
buyer does not need to give the seller a commercially reasonable time to perform. A, B, and C are incorrect as each of
the statements are accurate.   










Page 106

Question 982 - Contracts - Conditions (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

On July 15, in a writing signed by both parties, a fixture company agreed to deliver to a druggist on August 15 five
storage cabinets from inventory for a total price of $5,000 to be paid on delivery.  On August 1, the two parties orally
agreed to postpone the delivery date to August 20.  On August 20, the fixture company tendered the cabinets to the
druggist, who refused to accept or pay for them on the ground that they were not tendered on August 15, even though
they otherwise met the contract specifications.  

 Assuming that all appropriate defenses are seasonably raised, will the fixture company succeed in an action against
the druggist for breach of contract?  

A: Yes, because neither the July 15 agreement nor the August 1 agreement was required to be in writing. 
B: Yes, because the August 1 agreement operated as a waiver of the August 15 delivery term. 
C: No, because there was no consideration to support the August 1 agreement. 
D: No, because the parol evidence rule will prevent proof of the August 1 agreement. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  A waiver is an excuse of the nonoccurrence or delay of a condition to fulfill a duty.  Under the
UCC, consideration is not required for a valid waiver.  When the fixture company and the druggist agreed to postpone
their delivery date under the contract from August 15 to August 20, in effect the druggist waived a non-material term of
the agreement and the waiver was enforceable even without consideration.  The druggist, therefore, was not justified
in refusing to accept or to pay for the cabinets.  

 A is incorrect because the July 15 agreement falls within the UCC Statute of Frauds, which requires a signed writing
in order to enforce a contract for the sale of goods of $500 or more.  C is incorrect because the waiver did not require
consideration to be effective.  D is incorrect because the parol evidence rule does not apply to promises made after
the adoption of a final written contract.  










Page 107

Question 959 - Contracts - Conditions (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A broker needed a certain rare coin to complete a set that he had contracted to assemble and sell to a collector.  On
February 1, the broker obtained such a coin from a hoarder in exchange for $1,000 and the broker's signed, written
promise to re-deliver to the hoarder "not later than December 31 this year" a comparable specimen of the same kind
of coin without charge to the hoarder.  On February 2, the broker consummated sale of the complete set to the
collector.  

 On October 1, the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid, sustained rise; on October 15 the hoarder wrote
the broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment.  The broker replied, "In
view of the surprising market, it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks."  

 After receiving the broker's message on October 17, the hoarder telephoned the broker, who said, "I absolutely will
not replace your coin until the market drops far below its present level."  The hoarder then sued the broker on
November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by the broker in February.  The trial
began on December 1.  

 If the broker moves to dismiss the hoarder's complaint, which of the following is the hoarder's best argument in
opposing the motion.  

A: The hoarder's implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in enforcement of the contract required her to mitigate her
losses on the rising market by suing promptly, as she did, after becoming reasonably apprehensive of a prospective
breach by the broker. 
B: Although the doctrine of anticipatory breach is not applicable under the prevailing view if, at the time of repudiation,
the repudiatee owes the repudiator no remaining duty of performance, the doctrine applies in this case because the
hoarder, the repudiatee, remains potentially liable under an implied warranty that the coin advanced to the broker was
genuine. 
C: When either party to a sale-of-goods contract repudiates with respect to a performance not yet due, the loss of
which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may in good faith resort to any
appropriate remedy for breach. 
D: Anticipatory repudiation, as a deliberate disruption without legal excuse of an ongoing contractual relationship
between the parties, may be treated by the repudiatee at her election as a present tort, actionable at once. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  Under the UCC, when either party to a contract for the sale of goods repudiates the contract with
respect to a future performance that will substantially affect the value of that performance, the non-repudiating party
may resort to any appropriate remedy for breach.  A repudiation is an unequivocal statement of inability or
unwillingness to perform.  The broker's October 17 statement that he "absolutely will not" replace the hoarder's coin
until the market drops manifests such an intent; therefore the hoarder is entitled to treat his statement as a total
breach of contract, even though performance is not due until December 31.  

 A is incorrect because an injured party must act reasonably to mitigate damages only after the other party commits a
material breach or repudiates the contract.  B is incorrect because, although the common law recognizes an exception
where the non-repudiating party owes no remaining duty of performance, the UCC rule (which governs the hoarder-
broker contract because it is for the sale of a good) provides for no such exception.  D is incorrect because
repudiation typically does not entitle the non-repudiating party to bring a tort action.

Question 855 - Contracts - Conditions (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

The owner of a fleet of taxis contracted with a dealer in petroleum products for the purchase and sale of the taxi fleet
owner's total requirements of gasoline and oil for one year.  As part of that agreement, the petroleum dealer also
agreed with the taxi fleet owner that for one year the petroleum dealer would place all his advertising with the taxi fleet
owner's wife who owned her own small advertising agency.  When the wife was informed of the owner-dealer contract,
she declined to accept an advertising account from the soap company because she could not handle both the
petroleum dealer and the soap company accounts during the same year.  

 During the first month of the contract, the taxi fleet owner purchased substantial amounts of his gasoline from a
supplier other than the petroleum dealer, and the petroleum dealer thereupon notified the wife that he would no longer
place his advertising with her agency.  

 In an action against the petroleum dealer for breach of contract, the wife probably will  

A: succeed, because she is a third-party beneficiary of the owner-dealer contract. 
B: succeed, because the taxi fleet owner was acting as the wife's agent when he contracted with the petroleum
dealer. 
C: not succeed, because the failure of a constructive condition precedent excused the petroleum dealer's duty to
place his advertising with the wife. 
D: not succeed, because the wife did not provide any consideration to support the petroleum dealer's promise to place
his advertising with her. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, where one performance will take a period of time
to complete while the other can be completed in an instant, completion of the longer performance is a condition
precedent to the shorter performance.  A party's obligation to perform a contractual duty is excused if the other party
fails to satisfy a condition precedent.  Implicit in a requirements contract for the purchase and sale of a good is the
buyer's obligation to purchase all of its requirements for the good exclusively from the seller for the duration of the
contract.  Because the taxi fleet owner agreed to purchase its total requirements for gasoline and oil from the
petroleum dealer for one year, its purchase of substantial amounts of gasoline from a competitor amounted to a
material breach, thereby justifying the petroleum dealer's repudiation of its obligation to place advertising with the
wife.  

 Choice A is incorrect because even if the wife was an intended beneficiary, the petroleum dealer can raise any
defense against her that he can raise against the taxi fleet owner (i.e., that the taxi fleet owner committed a material
breach).  Choice B is incorrect because the facts show that only the taxi fleet owner was party to the contract with the
petroleum dealer; the wife was, if anything, only an incidental beneficiary.  Choice D is incorrect because the
consideration supporting the petroleum dealer's obligation to the wife was the taxi fleet owner's promise pursuant to
the requirements contract.

Question 287 - Contracts - Conditions (2/11/2017) 

The question was: 

A building owner and a purchaser made a written contract pursuant to which the building owner promised to convey a
specified apartment house to the purchaser in return for the purchaser's promise (1) to convey a 100-acre farm to the
building owner, and (2) to pay the building owner $1,000 in cash six months after the exchange of the apartment
house and the farm.  The contract contained the following provision: "It is understood and agreed that the purchaser's
obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the
building owner has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking
area in the rear of said apartment house."  

 Which of the following statements concerning the order of performances is LEAST accurate?  

A: The building owner's tendering of good title to the apartment house is a condition precedent to the purchaser's duty
to convey good title to the farm. 
B: The purchaser's tendering of good title to the farm is a condition precedent to the building owner's duty to convey
good title to the apartment house. 
C: The purchaser's tendering of good title to the farm is a condition subsequent to the building owner's duty to convey
good title to the apartment house. 
D: The building owner's tendering of good title to the apartment house and the purchaser's tendering of good title to
the farm are concurrent conditions. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

C is correct.  This question deals with the distinction between conditions precedent, conditions concurrent, and
conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate
performance arises in the other party. Conditions concurrent are conditions that can occur together with both parties
bound to perform at the same time. Therefore, each condition acts as a condition precedent to the other. Finally, a
condition subsequent is one which cuts off an existing duty of performance when it occurs.   

   Here, the building owner must convey the apartment to the purchaser, and at the same time the purchaser must
convey the farm to the building owner, or no further duty arises for either party.  After the purchaser conveys the farm
(but no more than three months after), the building owner has a duty to remove the shed behind the apartment.
Therefore, the building owner's conveyance of the apartment and the purchaser's tender of the farm are concurrent
conditions, and in effect each is a condition "precedent" to the other. Thus, A, B, and D are all accurate statements.   

    C is the least accurate statement because the purchaser's tendering of good title to the farm does not excuse the
building owner's duty to convey good title to the apartment house. Therefore, C is the correct answer.

Question 288 - Contracts - Conditions (2/11/2017) 

The question was: 

A building owner and a purchaser made a written contract pursuant to which the building owner promised to convey a
specified apartment house to the purchaser in return for the purchaser's promise (1) to convey a 100-acre farm to the
building owner, and (2) to pay the building owner $1,000 in cash six months after the exchange of the apartment
house and the farm.  The contract contained the following provision: "It is understood and agreed that the purchaser's
obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the
building owner has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking
area in the rear of the said apartment house."  

 The building owner's removal of the shed from the parking area of the apartment house is  

A: a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000. 
B: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000. 
C: a condition subsequent to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000. 
D: not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is the correct answer.  This question deals with the difference between conditions precedent, conditions concurrent,
and conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate
performance arises in the other party. Conditions concurrent are conditions the can occur together with both parties
bound to perform at the same time. A condition subsequent is one which cuts off an existing duty of performance
when it occurs. Here, the obligation to remove the shed will give rise to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000.
Therefore, it functions as a condition precedent to that duty. However, the condition is worded so the failure to remove
the shed by the three month deadline will extinguish the purchaser's obligation to pay the $1,000, making it a condition
subsequent in form. Thus, A is the appropriate response and B, C and D are incorrect.

Question 334 - Contracts - Consideration (7/23/2016) 

The question was: 

A man saved the life of his friend's wife who thereafter changed her will to leave the man $1,000.  However, upon the
wife's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety of the
husband.  The property had been purchased by the husband from an inheritance.  

 After the wife died, the husband signed and delivered to the man the following instrument: "In consideration of [the
man]'s saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I hereby
promise to pay [the man] $1,000."  

 Upon the husband's death, the man filed a claim for $1,000.  The husband's executor contested the claim on the
ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration.  

 With respect to the recital that the man had agreed not to file a claim against the husband's estate, what additional
fact would most strengthen the man's claim?  

A: The man's agreement was made in a writing he signed. 
B: The man reasonably believed he had a valid claim when the instrument was signed. 
C: The wife had contributed to accumulation of the real property. 
D: The man paid the husband $1 when he received the instrument. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct. A promise to surrender a legal claim is sufficient consideration to support a return promise even if
the claim turns out to be invalid, so long as the person surrendering the claim has a good faith belief in its validity. As
long as the man genuinely believed that he had a valid claim against the husband, his promise to relinquish such
claim provides sufficient consideration to support the husband's promise to pay the man $1,000.   

 A is incorrect because a writing would not excuse an absence of consideration. C is incorrect because the tenancy in
the entirety would preclude her devise to the man. D is incorrect because some courts will find that the payment of
nominal consideration in exchange for a promise is a "mere pretense" of a bargain and is not enforceable.

Question 333 - Contracts - Consideration (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

A man saved the life of his friend's wife who thereafter changed her will to leave the man $1,000.  However, upon the
wife's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety of the
husband.  The property had been purchased by the husband from an inheritance.  

 After the wife died, the husband signed and delivered to the man the following instrument: "In consideration of [the
man]'s saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I hereby
promise to pay [the man] $1,000."  

 Upon the husband's death, the man filed a claim for $1,000.  The husband's executor contested the claim on the
ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration.  

 In most states, would the man's saving of the wife's life be regarded as sufficient consideration for the husband's
promise?  

A: Yes, because the husband was thereby morally obligated to the man. 
B: Yes, because the husband was thereby materially benefited. 
C: No, because the husband had not asked the man to save her. 
D: No, because the value of the man's act was too uncertain. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by bargained-for consideration.
Consideration is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise.
Although the husband's promise states that it is given "in consideration of the man's saving" the wife's life, in fact it is
not sufficient consideration to support the husband's promise.  The husband did not make the promise to pay $1,000
in exchange for the man's act, nor did the man save the wife's life in exchange for the husband's promise.  

 A and B are incorrect because neither moral obligation nor material benefit alone is a sufficient basis for finding
consideration.  D is incorrect because the respective values of consideration exchanged is not relevant to whether
consideration is sufficient; what matters is whether the consideration was bargained for.

Question 64 - Contracts - Consideration (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile driven by
the woman.  Both the son and the woman were injured.  The father, erroneously believing that he was liable because
he owned the automobile, said to the woman: "I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a
result of the accident."  The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would
pay the bill.  

 The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries.  One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating that
the son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate.  The father
replied: "If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you."  

 The father honestly believed that he did not owe the creditor anything and at first refused to pay anything to the
creditor.  If the creditor, honestly believing that the father owed him $200, then accepts $150 from the father in
settlement of the claim, will the creditor succeed in an action against the father for the remaining $50?  

A: Yes, because the son's debt of $200 was liquidated and undisputed. 
B: Yes, because the creditor honestly believed that he had a legal right against the father for the full $200. 
C: No, because the father honestly believed that the creditor did not have a legal right against him for the $200. 
D: No, because the father was not contractually obligated to pay the creditor $200 in the first place. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct. The creditor will not succeed against the father because the original contract has been
discharged through accord and satisfaction. Partial payment of an original debt will satisfy as an accord and
satisfaction if there is a bona fide dispute about the validity of the claim. Here, the father honestly did not believe that
he owed the creditor. Therefore, the creditor's acceptance of $150 from the father "in settlement of the claim" is a valid
accord and satisfaction, resulting in the discharge of the original contract. Thus, the creditor is not entitled to the
remaining $50.  

   A is incorrect because the fact that the son's debt to the creditor was undisputed does not prevent the father's use of
accord and satisfaction if the father believes in good faith that he does not owe the creditor. B is incorrect because the
creditor's honest belief will not prevent the discharge of the original debt by accord and satisfaction if the creditor
accepts the payment without reservation. D is incorrect because if the creditor believed in good faith that his claim
against the son's estate was valid, then the creditor's forbearance of his legal right to sue was adequate consideration
for the father's promise to pay $200.  











Page 114

Question 779 - Contracts - Consideration (2/11/2017) 

The question was: 

On June 1, a widget manufacturer entered into a written agreement with a tool maker in which the tool maker agreed
to produce and sell to the manufacturer 12 sets of newly designed dies to be delivered August 1 for the price of
$50,000, payable ten days after delivery.  Encountering unexpected expenses in the purchase of special alloy steel
required for the dies, the tool maker advised the manufacturer that production costs would exceed the contract price;
and on July 1, the manufacturer and the tool maker signed a modification to the June 1 agreement increasing the
contract price to $60,000.  After timely receipt of 12 sets of dies conforming to the contract specifications, the
manufacturer paid the tool maker $50,000 but refused to pay more.  

 Which of the following concepts of the Uniform Commercial Code, dealing expressly with the sale of goods, best
supports an action by the tool maker to recover $10,000 for breach of the manufacturer's July 1 promise?  

A: Bargained-for exchange. 
B: Promissory estoppel. 
C: Modification of contracts without consideration. 
D: Unconscionability in the formation of contracts. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  Under the UCC, a modification to a contract for the sale of goods needs no additional
consideration to be binding if the modification was made in good faith.  Although the modification increasing the
purchase price under the tool maker-manufacturer contract was unilateral, and therefore not supported by
consideration, the modification was made in light of unexpected increased production costs, which suggests that it
was proposed in good faith rather than to coerce the manufacturer into paying a higher price.  Answer A is incorrect
because of the UCC rule dispensing with consideration for good faith modifications.  Answers B and D are incorrect
because the facts do not show either detrimental reliance or unconscionability.

Question 1518 - Contracts - Defenses to Enforceability (2/11/2017) 

The question was: 

In a telephone conversation, a jewelry maker offered to buy 100 ounces of gold from a precious metals company if
delivery could be made within 10 days. The jewelry maker did not specify a price, but the market price for 100 ounces
of gold at the time of the conversation was approximately $65,000. Without otherwise responding, the company
delivered the gold six days later.   

In the meantime, the project for which the jewelry maker planned to use the gold was canceled. The jewelry maker
therefore refused to accept delivery of the gold or to pay the $65,000 demanded by the company.   

Is there an enforceable contract between the jewelry maker and the company?  

A: No, because the parties did not agree on a price term. 
B: No, because the parties did not put their agreement in writing. 
C: Yes, because the absence of a price term does not defeat the formation of a valid contract for the sale of goods
where the parties otherwise intended to form a contract. 
D: Yes, because the company relied on an implied promise to pay when it delivered the gold. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect. Under UCC § 2-305, a contract may be enforceable in the absence of a price term so long as the
parties otherwise intended to enter into a contract. In this case, the dispositive issue is whether the parties' oral
agreement is enforceable. Under UCC § 2-201(1), a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or more is not
enforceable unless there is a writing indicating the contract that is signed by the party against whom enforcement is
sought. In this case, the absence of such a writing signed by the jewelry maker renders the parties' oral agreement
unenforceable. An exception to the writing requirement arises when a seller delivers goods that are accepted by the
buyer, but in this case, the jewelry maker did not accept the gold.   

B is correct. The parties failed to comply with the writing requirement of UCC § 2-201(1). Under that section, a
contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or more is not enforceable unless there is a writing indicating a
contract of sale that is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. In this case, the absence of such a
writing signed by the jewelry maker renders the parties' oral agreement unenforceable. An exception to the writing
requirement arises when a seller delivers goods that are accepted by the buyer, but in this case, the jewelry maker did
not accept the gold.   

C is incorrect. Under UCC § 2-305, a contract may be enforceable in the absence of a price term so long as the
parties otherwise intended to enter into a contract. In this case, however, the dispositive issue is whether the parties'
oral agreement is enforceable. Under UCC § 2-201(1), a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or more is
not enforceable unless there is a writing indicating the contract that is signed by the party against whom enforcement
is sought. The absence of such a writing signed by the jewelry maker renders the parties' oral agreement
unenforceable. An exception to the writing requirement arises when a seller delivers goods that are accepted by the
buyer. In this case, however, the jewelry maker did not accept the gold.   

D is incorrect. The dispositive issue in this case is whether the parties' oral agreement is enforceable. Under UCC § 2-
201(1), a contract for the sale of goods for a price of $500 or more is not enforceable unless there is a writing
indicating the contract that is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. The absence of such a writing
signed by the jewelry maker renders the parties' oral agreement unenforceable. An exception to the writing
requirement arises when a seller delivers goods that are accepted by the buyer. In this case, however, the jewelry
maker did not accept the gold.

Question 310 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

On November 1, the following notice was posted in a privately-operated law school:  

The faculty, seeking to encourage legal research, offers to any student at this school who wins the current National
Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500.  All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office
before May 1. A student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on
obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner.  The student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed
note saying, "I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer."  This note was inadvertently placed in a
student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally.  On the following April 1, the above
notice was removed and the following substituted therefore:  

The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. The student's
paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15.  On May 1, it was announced that the student had won the
National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000.  The law faculty refused to pay anything.  

 Assuming that the faculty's notice of November 1 was posted on a bulletin board or other conspicuous place
commonly viewed by all persons in the law school, such notice constituted a  

A: preliminary invitation to deal, analogous to newspaper advertisements for the sale of goods by merchants. 
B: contractual offer, creating a power of acceptance. 
C: preliminary invitation, because no offeree was named therein. 
D: promise to make a conditional, future gift of money. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter a bargain, which is made in such a way that the
offeree is justified in thinking that her assent will conclude a bargain.  Advertisements or announcements directed to
the public at large typically are construed as invitations to deal and not as offers, in part out of concern that an open-
ended offer to the public would expose the offeror to excessive liability.  This rationale will not apply, however, if the
language in the announcement is qualified with limiting language such as "first come first served."  Because the
faculty's $500 offer was limited to the winner of the competition, the public posting of the faculty's notice may
reasonably be construed to be an offer.  

 A and C are incorrect because, as explained above, an advertisement or announcement may be construed as an
offer where the language of the offer is sufficiently definite.  D is incorrect because the offer is not merely gratuitous
but seeks the return performance of competing in and winning the writing competition.

Question 431 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

On June 1, a manufacturer of men's neckties received the following order from a retailer: "Ship 500 two-inch ties,
assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34.  Delivery by July 1."  

 On June 1, the manufacturer shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at the retailer's place of business on June 3.
The retailer immediately telegraphed the manufacturer: "Reject your shipment.  Order was for two-inch ties."  The
retailer, however, did not ship the ties back to the manufacturer.  The manufacturer replied by telegram: "Will deliver
proper ties before July 1."  The retailer received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it.  

 On June 30, the manufacturer tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No.
V34, but the retailer refused to accept them.  

 Did the retailer properly reject the ties delivered on June 3?  

A: Yes, because the ties were nonconforming goods. 
B: Yes, because the manufacturer did not notify the retailer that the ties were shipped as an accommodation to the
retailer. 
C: No, because the manufacturer could accept the retailer's offer by prompt shipment of either conforming or
nonconforming goods. 
D: No, because the retailer waived his right to reject the ties by not returning them promptly to the manufacturer. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct.  The retailer satisfied its duty to promptly notify the manufacturer that the goods were rejected as
nonconforming.  

 B and C are incorrect because pursuant to UCC 2-206, a seller accepts whether it ships conforming or
nonconforming goods.  If the seller's shipment, however, is accompanied by notice that the goods are nonconforming
and are offered as an accommodation, the seller has not accepted but has made a counter offer, which the retailer
could have accepted or rejected.  The manufacturer's shipment without notice constituted an attempted acceptance
and simultaneously a breach of contract.  The retailer was entitled to perfect tender of the goods under UCC 2-601
and was free to reject goods that failed "in any respect to conform to the contract."  

 D is incorrect because the retailer did not waive his rights upon rejection and retention of the goods.  He was under a
duty to notify the seller and to hold the goods "with reasonable care at the seller's disposition for a time sufficient to
permit the seller to remove them."  UCC 2-602(2)(b). 













Page 118

Question 98 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

During 2006 a series of arsons, one of which damaged a huge store, occurred in a city.  In early 2007 the city's City
Council adopted this resolution:  

The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed here. The
foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week.  Subsequently, the store, by a
written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 "for each day's work you actually
perform in investigating our fire."  Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer
and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television
station having meanwhile ceased operations.  In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to
the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons.  The store's president thereupon paid the detective at the
proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward, of which the
detective had been previously unaware.  The detective immediately made the claim.  In December, 2007, as a result
of the detective's investigation, the store's employee was convicted of burning the store.  The city, which has no
immunity to suit, has since refused to pay the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's
repealer before claiming its reward.  

 In which of the following ways could the city reward offer be effectively accepted?  

A: Only by an offeree's return promise to make a reasonable effort to bring about the arrest and conviction of an
arsonist within the scope of the offer. 
B: Only by an offeree's making the arrest and assisting in the successful conviction of an arsonist within the scope of
the offer. 
C: By an offeree's supplying information leading to arrest and conviction of an arsonist within the scope of the offer. 
D: By an offeree's communication of assent through the same medium (television) used by the city in making its offer. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  The resolution is an offer of a reward made to the general public.  A reasonable interpretation of
its words and the circumstances surrounding its broadcast on television indicate that it is inviting anyone to provide
the information necessary to arrest and convict. Therefore, an acceptance of this offer made by the city would be any
information given that would lead to an arrest of the arsonist.  

   A is incorrect because the language of the reward and the nature of a reward indicate that performance is invited
and not promissory acceptance.  B is incorrect because it is not reasonable to interpret the words of the reward as
requiring actual arrest and participation in the prosecution of an individual when the offer of reward receives such
widespread broadcast to the general public.  D is incorrect because in order for an offer to require a particular mode of
acceptance, it must be clearly stated in the offer.  If the offer is silent as to mode of acceptance, a test of
reasonableness applies.  It would not be reasonable to require such an unorthodox and unavailable mode of
acceptance.  In this case, a reasonable interpretation of the offer is to require performance, not a promissory
acceptance.

Question 102 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

During 2006 a series of arsons, one of which damaged a huge store, occurred in a city.  In early 2007 the city's City
Council adopted this resolution:  

The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed here. The
foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week.  Subsequently, the store, by a
written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 "for each day's work you actually
perform in investigating our fire."  Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer
and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television
station having meanwhile ceased operations.  In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to
the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons.  The store's president thereupon paid the detective at the

of the detective's investigation, the store's employee was convicted of burning the store.  The city, which has no
immunity to suit, has since refused to pay the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's
repealer before claiming its reward.  

In a suit by the detective against the city to recover the $10,000 reward, which of the following, in light of the facts
given, most usefully supports the detective's claim?   

A: The city was benefited as a result of the detective's services. 
B: The city's offer was in the nature of a bounty, so that the elements of contract are not essential to the city's liability. 
C: The fact that the city attempted to revoke its offer only a few months after making it demonstrated that the
attempted revocation was in bad faith. 
D: Although there was no bargained for exchange between the detective and the city, the detective's claim for the
reward is supported by a moral obligation on the part of the city. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  If the reward were characterized as a government bounty, the detective's knowledge of the
reward after obtaining the confession and the earlier attempted revocation would not be determinative.  

 A is incorrect because although the city benefited, the detective had no reasonable expectation of payment from the
city due to his lack of knowledge of the offer, the prior revocation, and the fact that his expectation of payment was
from the huge store.  C is incorrect.  The city was free to revoke the offer for any reason so long as the city revoked by
means of general notification equal to that given to the offer.  D is also incorrect because even if the reward would
create a moral obligation, the city made no subsequent promise to pay the detective.  If the reward itself comprised
the promise upon which a moral obligation might arise, such an obligation would not arise for an individual who
remained unaware of the promise.

Question 766 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A wallpaper hanger sent a general contractor, this telegram:  Will do all paperhanging on new Doctors' Building, per
owner's specs, for $14,000 if you accept within reasonable time after main contract awarded.  

                                                                              /s/  the wallpaper hanger Three other competing hangers sent the
general contractor similar bids in the respective amounts of $18,000, $19,000, and $20,000.  The general contractor
used the wallpaper hanger's $14,000 figure in preparing and submitting her own sealed bid on Doctors' Building.
Before the bids were opened, the wallpaper hanger truthfully advised the general contractor that the former's
telegraphic sub-bid had been based on a $4,000 computational error and was therefore revoked.  Shortly thereafter,
the general contractor was awarded the Doctors' Building construction contract and subsequently contracted with
another paperhanger for a price of $18,000.  The general contractor now sues the wallpaper hanger to recover
$4,000.  

 Which of the following, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor's prospect of recovery?  

A: After the wallpaper hanger's notice of revocation, the general contractor made a reasonable effort to subcontract
with another paperhanger at the lowest possible price. 
B: The general contractor had been required by the owner to submit a bid bond and could not have withdrawn or
amended her bid on the main contract without forfeiting that bond. 
C: The wallpaper hanger was negligent in erroneously calculating the amount of his sub-bid. 
D: The general contractor dealt with all of her subcontractors in good faith and without seeking to renegotiate (lower)
the prices they had bid. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  Unless the promisor has given an option promise supported by consideration, generally an offer
is freely revocable until the time of acceptance.  However, an offer may be irrevocable to the extent necessary to
avoid injustice if the offeror should reasonably expect the offer to induce substantial reliance on the part of the offeree
and where there is reliance in fact.  The terms of the wallpaper hanger's offer suggest that the wallpaper hanger
expected the general contractor to rely on his bid by utilizing it in calculating the general contractor's overall bid, and
the general contractor in fact did rely on his bid.  The fact that the general contractor was required to submit a bid
bond to guarantee her bid demonstrates the substantial nature of the general contractor's reliance, because it shows
the general contractor cannot pass the additional wallpapering cost on to the owner.  Therefore this fact, if proved,
would most strengthen the general contractor's case for recovery.  

 A, C and D are incorrect because, although each of these factors (mitigation of damages, the wallpaper hanger's
negligence and the general contractor's good faith) may weigh in the general contractor's favor, the wallpaper hanger
revoked her bid prior to the general contractor's acceptance.  Therefore the general contractor cannot recover from
the wallpaper hanger for breach of contract unless she can demonstrate that the wallpaper hanger's bid was
irrevocable on a reliance theory.

Question 622 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A developer, needing a water well on one of his projects, met several times about the matter with a well driller.
Subsequently, the well driller sent a developer an unsigned typewritten form captioned "WELL DRILLING
PROPOSAL" and stating various terms the two had discussed but not agreed upon, including a "proposed price of
$5,000."  The form concluded, "This proposal will not become a contract until signed by you [the developer] and then
returned to and signed by me [the well driller]."  

 The developer signed the form and returned it to the well driller, who neglected to sign it but promptly began drilling
the well at the proposed site on the developer's project.  After drilling for two days, the well driller told the developer
during one of the developer's daily visits that he would not finish unless the developer would agree to pay twice the
price recited in the written proposal.  The developer refused, the well driller quit, and the developer hired substitute to
drill the well to completion for a price of $7,500.  

 In an action by the developer against the well driller for damages, which of the following is the probable decision?  

A: The developer wins, because his signing of the well driller's form constituted an acceptance of an offer by the well
driller. 
B: The developer wins, because the well driller's commencement of performance constituted an acceptance by the
well driller of an offer by the developer and an implied promise by the well driller to complete the well. 
C: The well driller wins, because he never signed the proposal as required by its terms. 
D: The well driller wins, because his commencement of performance merely prevented the developer from revoking
his offer, made on a form supplied by the well driller, and did not obligate the well driller to complete the well. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  An offer is a manifestation of a willingness to bargain that creates a capacity in the offeree to
form a contract by consent.  Since the form that the well driller sent to the developer stated that the proposal would
not be a contract until signed by both parties, it is not an offer because it does not manifest an intent to conclude a
contract upon mere signing by the developer.  However, after the developer signed the form, the form became an
offer that the well driller could accept either by signing the form or by manifesting assent in some other way (such as
by commencing performance).  

 A is incorrect because the developer's signing of the form amounted to an offer and not an acceptance.  C is incorrect
because the well driller manifested assent by commencing performance.  D is incorrect because the offer sought a
return promise, which the well driller implicitly made by commencing performance.

Question 844 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A son, who knew nothing about horses, inherited a thoroughbred colt whose disagreeable behavior made him a pest
around the barn.  The son sold the colt for $1,500 to an experienced racehorse-trainer who knew of the son's
ignorance about horses.  At the time of the sale, the son said to the trainer, "I hate to say it, but this horse is bad-
tempered and nothing special."  

 Which one of the following scenarios would best support an action by the trainer, rather than the son, to rescind the
sale?  

A: In his first race after the sale, the horse galloped to a huge lead but dropped dead 100 yards from the finish line
because of a rare congenital heart defect that was undiscoverable except by autopsy. 
B: The horse won $5 million for the trainer over a three-year racing career but upon being retired was found to be
incurably sterile and useless as a breeder. 
C: After the horse had won three races for the trainer, it was discovered that by clerical error, unknown to either party,
the horse's official birth registration listed an undistinguished racehorse as the sire rather than the famous racehorse
that in fact was the sire. 
D: A week after the sale, the horse went berserk and inflicted serious injuries upon the trainer that required his
hospitalization for six months and a full year for his recovery. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct.  A contract may be rescinded on grounds of mutual mistake where the mistake relates to a
fundamental assumption of the contract that has a material effect on the exchange, and where the party seeking
rescission is found by the court not to bear the risk of the mistake.  If in his first race after the sale, the horse dropped
dead of a rare, undiscoverable heart condition, the trainer could make a plausible argument that the contract be
rescinded on grounds of mistake.  The condition related to a fundamental assumption (the horse's suitability for
racing) that destroyed the subject matter of the contract, and since the heart condition was not expected or
discoverable, a court might find that the trainer should not bear the risk of the mistake.  

 B and C are incorrect because neither of these factors relate to a fundamental assumption of the contract, since the
facts suggest that the horse was purchased as a racehorse and not a breeder.  D is incorrect because the risk that the
horse might go beserk was one of which the trainer had notice, and was therefore a risk that he should bear.

Question 892 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A buyer faxed the following signed message to his long-time widget supplier: "Urgently need blue widgets.  Ship
immediately three gross at your current list price of $600."  Upon receipt of the fax, the supplier shipped three gross of
red widgets to the buyer, and faxed to the buyer the following message: "Temporarily out of blue.  In case red will
help, am shipping three gross at the same price.  Hope you can use them."  

 Upon the buyer's timely receipt of both the shipment and the supplier's fax, which of the following best describes the
rights and duties of the buyer and the supplier?  

A: The buyer may accept the shipment, in which case he must pay the supplier the list price, or he must reject the
shipment and recover from the supplier for total breach of contract. 
B: The buyer may accept the shipment, in which case he must pay the supplier the list price, or he may reject the
shipment, in which case he has no further rights against the supplier. 
C: The buyer may accept the shipment, in which case he must pay the supplier the list price, less any damages
sustained because of the nonconforming shipment, or he may reject the shipment and recover from the supplier for
total breach of contract, subject to the supplier's right to cure. 
D: The buyer may accept the shipment, in which case he must pay the supplier the list price, less any damages
sustained because of the nonconforming shipment, or he may reject the shipment provided that he promptly covers by
obtaining conforming widgets from another supplier. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct. Under the UCC, an order of goods for prompt shipment may be construed as inviting acceptance
by a shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods. However, if the seller indicates that the shipment of non-
conforming goods is offered as an accommodation to the buyer, the shipment will be construed as a counteroffer
instead of an acceptance. Because the seller's note indicates that he shipped red widgets to accommodate the buyer,
his shipment of red widgets was not an acceptance of the buyer's offer and therefore was also not a breach of
contract. A is incorrect because if the buyer rejects the shipment, there is no contract and the buyer has no right to
recover damages against the supplier. C and D are incorrect because the accommodating shipment is a counteroffer,
so there will be no recovery of damages against the supplier if it is accepted.

Question 221 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

On May 1 a lot owner telegraphed a buyer, "Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grover subdivision at $5,000 each.
Details will follow in letter."  The letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of payment, insurance,
mortgages, etc., and provided, "This offer remains open until June 1."  

 On May 2, after he had received the telegram but before he had received the letter, the buyer telegraphed the owner,
"Accept your offer with respect to lot 101."  Both parties knew that there were fifty lots in the Grover subdivision and
that they were numbered 101 through 150.  

 Assume that on May 6 the buyer telegraphed the owner, "Will take the rest of the lots," and that on May 8 the owner
discovered that he did not have good title to the remaining lots.  Which of the following would provide the best legal
support to the owner's contention that he was not liable for breach of contract as to the remaining forty-nine lots?  

A: Impossibility of performance 
B: Unilateral mistake as to basic assumption 
C: Termination of the offer by the buyer's having first contracted to buy lot 101 
D: Excuse by failure of an implied condition precedent. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  When the buyer accepted the owner's offer to buy lot 101 on May 2, he implicitly rejected the
offer to purchase the remaining lots, and his rejection terminated his power of acceptance as to the remaining lots.  A
is incorrect because at the time the contract was made on May 2, the owner either had reason to know that he did not
have good title to the remaining lots or he was at fault in not knowing, and thus his performance would not be excused
as impossible or impracticable.  B is incorrect because both parties were mistaken as to the owner's interest in the
property.  D is incorrect because, although the law does imply a condition into the agreement that the owner convey
marketable title, the owner's failure to do so allows the buyer to elect to either rescind or to take title with the defect
and to pay the full purchase price.

Question 722 - Contracts - Formation of Contracts (2/9/2017) 

The question was: 

A buyer ordered from a seller 500 bushels of No. 1 Royal Fuzz peaches, at a specified price, "for prompt shipment."
The seller promptly shipped 500 bushels, but by mistake shipped No. 2 Royal Fuzz peaches instead of No. 1.  The
error in shipment was caused by the negligence of the seller's shipping clerk.  

 Which of the following best states the buyer's rights and duties upon delivery of the peaches?  

A: The seller's shipment of the peaches was a counteroffer and the buyer can refuse to accept them. 
B: The seller's shipment of the peaches was a counteroffer but, since peaches are perishable, the buyer, if it does not
want to accept them, must reship the peaches to the seller in order to mitigate the seller's losses. 
C: The buyer must accept the peaches because a contract was formed when the seller shipped them. 
D: Although a contract was formed when the seller shipped the peaches, the buyer does not have to accept them. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer D is correct.  Under the UCC, an order to buy goods "for prompt shipment" is interpreted as inviting
acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by a prompt shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods.
Where the goods delivered fail to conform to the contract, the buyer may reject the goods if the rejection is made
within a reasonable time after delivery.  When the buyer ordered 500 bushels of peaches "for prompt shipment," the
seller accepted by shipping No. 2 (rather than No. 1) Royal Fuzz peaches, and therefore the buyer has the right to
reject them.  Answers A and B are incorrect because the prompt shipment will be interpreted as an acceptance even if
the goods are non-conforming.  Answer C is incorrect because although a contract was formed, the buyer has the
right to reject non-conforming goods.

Question 880 - Contracts - Impracticability and Frustration of Purpose (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

The manager of a state fair contracted with a renowned hog breeder to exhibit the breeder's world champion animal
for the three weeks of the annual fair, at the conclusion of which the breeder would receive an honorarium of $300.
Two days before the opening of the fair, the champion animal took sick with boarsitis, a communicable disease among
swine, and, under the applicable state quarantine law, very probably could not be exhibited for at least a month.  

 Upon learning this, the manager can legally pursue which of the following courses of action with respect to his
contract with the breeder?  

A: Suspend his own performance, demand assurances from the breeder, and treat a failure by the breeder to give
them as an actionable repudiation. 
B: Suspend his own performance and recover damages from the breeder for breach of contract unless the breeder at
once supplies an undiseased hog of exhibition quality as a substitute for the champion animal. 
C: Terminate his own performance and treat the animal's illness as discharging all remaining duties under the
contract. 
D: Terminate the contract, but only if he (the manager) seeks promptly to obtain for the exhibit a suitable substitute for
the champion animal from another hog owner. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  A contract may be rescinded on grounds of supervening impracticability where a party's
performance is made impracticable without his fault due to the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which
was a basic assumption on which the contract was made.  Such event may include the destruction or deterioration of
a specific thing necessary for the performance of a duty or the necessity to comply with a governmental order.
Because the breeder undertook to exhibit his world champion animal(and not any other hog), the animal's availability
for exhibition is a basic assumption of the contract.  The animal's illness, which requires him to be quarantined for a
month under state law, renders the breeder's performance impracticable.  Therefore the manager should treat both
parties' obligations under the contract as discharged.  

 A, B and D are incorrect because the animal's illness provides a basis for excuse of the breeder's obligation.
Specifically, as explained above, the breeder is not obligated to provide a substitute hog because the contract only
contemplated exhibiting the champion animal.

Question 1137 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

A computer company contracted in writing with a bank to sell and deliver to the bank a mainframe computer using a
new type of magnetic memory, then under development but not perfected by the computer company, at a price
substantially lower than that of a similar computer using current technology.  The contract's delivery term was "F.O.B.
the bank, on or before July 31."  

 Assume that the computer company tendered the computer to the bank on August 15, and that the bank rejected it
because of delay.  

 If the computer company sues the bank for breach of contract, which of the following facts, if proved, will best support
a recovery by the computer company?  

A: The delay did not materially harm the bank. 
B: The computer company believed, on the assumption that the bank was getting a "super deal" for its money, that
the bank would not reject because of the late tender of delivery. 
C: The computer company's delay in tender was caused by a truckers' strike. 
D: A usage in the relevant trade allows computer sellers a 30-day leeway in a specified time of delivery, unless the
usage is expressly negated by the contract. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer D is correct.  Under the UCC, any trade usage that is observed with sufficient regularity in a place, vocation,
or trade so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it can be introduced to interpret the
parties' agreement, so long as the usage can be reasonably construed as being consistent with the express terms of
the contract.  Indeed, the UCC defines "agreement" as including the parties' express terms as well as those that are
implied by applicable trade usage.  Although the written contract between the computer company and the bank called
for delivery "on or before July 31," the trade usage that the computer company seeks to introduce suggests that
buyers should allow for up to 30-days' leeway beyond that date.  If the contract were construed in light of this usage,
then the August 15 delivery would not be a breach of the contract and the bank would be in breach for refusing to take
delivery on that date.  The fact that buyers and sellers typically negate the usage with express language if the delivery
date is to be construed strictly suggests that the trade usage is fairly persuasive evidence of the parties' intent.  

 A is incorrect because even an immaterial delay in delivery would entitle the bank to reject delivery of the computer.
B is incorrect because such an inference would not be reasonable if the contract is literally construed as requiring
delivery "on or before July 31."  C is incorrect because a truckers' strike would not justify excuse on grounds of
impracticability, because the facts do not suggest that the availability of ground shipment is a basic assumption on
which the contract was made.

Question 1542 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

A buyer purchased a new car from a dealer under a written contract that provided that the price of the car was
$20,000 and that the buyer would receive a "trade-in allowance of $7,000 for the buyer's old car." The old car had
recently been damaged in an accident. The contract contained a merger clause stating: "This writing constitutes the
entire agreement of the parties, and there are no other understandings or agreements not set forth herein." When the
buyer took possession of the new car, she delivered the old car to the dealer. At that time, the dealer claimed that the
trade-in allowance included an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance company for damage to the old
car. The buyer refused to provide the assignment.   

The dealer sued the buyer to recover the insurance payment. The dealer has offered evidence that the parties agreed
during their negotiations for the new car that the dealer was entitled to the insurance payment.   

Should the court admit this evidence?  

A: No, because the dealer's acceptance of the old car bars any additional claim by the dealer. 
B: No, because the merger clause bars any evidence of the parties' prior discussions concerning the trade-in
allowance. 
C: Yes, because a merger clause does not bar evidence of fraud. 
D: Yes, because the merger clause does not bar evidence to explain what the parties meant by "trade-in allowance."  

The explanation for the answer is: 

A is incorrect.  A  buyer's  mere  acceptance  of  goods  does  not  waive  its  potential  claims  against  a  seller.  The
dispositive issue here is whether the parol evidence rule will allow the proffered evidence. Under that rule, a merger
clause does not conclusively determine that an agreement is completely integrated. Moreover, a finding that  an
agreement  is  completely  integrated  does  not  necessarily  bar  the  admission  of  extrinsic  evidence. Although
extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to supplement or contradict the express terms of a completely integrated
agreement, such evidence is admissible to explain the terms of an agreement. In this case, evidence of the  parties'
discussions  during  their  negotiations  is  admissible  to  aid  in  explaining  whether  they  intended "trade-in
allowance" to include an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance company.   

B is incorrect. Under the UCC's parol evidence rule, a merger clause does not conclusively determine that an
agreement is completely integrated. Moreover, a finding that an agreement is completely integrated does not
necessarily bar the admission of extrinsic evidence. Although extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to supplement or
contradict the express terms of a completely integrated agreement, such evidence is admissible to explain the terms
of an agreement. In this case, evidence of the parties' discussions during their negotiations is admissible to aid in
explaining whether they intended "trade-in allowance" to include an assignment of the buyer's claim against her
insurance company.   

C is incorrect. The UCC's parol evidence rule allows the introduction of extrinsic evidence to establish fraud even if an
agreement is completely integrated. Because there is no indication of fraud in this case, the fraud exception is
irrelevant. The dispositive issue here is whether the parol evidence rule will allow the proffered evidence. Under that
rule, a merger clause does not conclusively determine that an agreement is completely integrated. Moreover, a finding
that an agreement is completely integrated does not necessarily bar the admission of extrinsic evidence. Although
extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to supplement or contradict the express terms of a completely integrated
agreement, such evidence is admissible to explain the terms of an agreement. In this case, evidence of the  parties'
discussions  during  their  negotiations  is  admissible  to  aid  in  explaining  whether  they  intended "trade-in
allowance" to include an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance company.   

D is correct. Under the UCC's parol evidence rule, a merger clause does not conclusively establish that an agreement
is completely integrated. Moreover, a finding that an agreement is completely integrated does not necessarily bar the
admission of extrinsic evidence. Although extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to supplement or contradict the express
terms of a completely integrated agreement, such evidence is admissible to explain the terms of an agreement. In this
case, evidence of the parties' discussions during their negotiations is admissible to aid in explaining whether they
intended "trade-in- allowance" to include an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance company.

Question 1020 - Contracts - Parol Evidence and Interpretation (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A buyer contracted in writing with a shareholder, who owned all of XYZ Corporation's outstanding stock, to purchase
all of her stock at a specified price per share.  At the time this contract was executed, the buyer's contracting officer
said to the shareholder, "Of course, our commitment to buy is conditioned on our obtaining approval of the contract
from our parent company."  The shareholder replied, "Fine.  No problem."  

 The shareholder is willing and ready to consummate the sale of her stock to the buyer, but the latter refuses to
perform on the ground (which is true) that the parent company has firmly refused to approve the contract.  

 If the shareholder sues the buyer for breach of contract and seeks to exclude any evidence of the oral condition
requiring the parent company's approval, the court will probably  

A: admit the evidence as proof of a collateral agreement. 
B: admit the evidence as proof of a condition to the existence of an enforceable obligation, and therefore not within
the scope of the parol evidence rule. 
C: exclude the evidence on the basis of a finding that the parties' written agreement was a complete integration of
their contract. 
D: exclude the evidence as contradicting the terms of the parties' written agreement, whether or not the writing was a
complete integration of the contract. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement where the prior agreement
contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely
integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the
parties' understanding).  An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to
prove that the written agreement is to take effect only upon the occurrence of a stated condition (even if the condition
is for only one party's benefit).  Because the buyer-shareholder agreement will only take effect upon approval by the
parent company, extrinsic evidence of this oral understanding is admissible notwithstanding the parol evidence rule.  

    A is incorrect because the condition appears to be an integral part of the contract of sale.  C and D are incorrect
because the exception to the parol evidence rule for conditions precedent applies regardless of whether the final
writing is partially or completely integrated and regardless of whether the extrinsic evidence may contradict the final
writing (although these facts fail to suggest any such contradiction).

Question 251 - Contracts - Remedies (7/23/2016) 

The question was: 

On March 2, a landowner and a builder orally agreed that the builder would erect a boathouse on the landowner's lot
and dig a channel from the boathouse, across a neighbor's lot, to a lake.  The neighbor had already orally agreed with
the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot.  The builder agreed to begin work on the
boathouse on March 15, and to complete all the work before June 1.  The total price of $10,000 was to be paid by the
landowner in three installments: $2,500 on March 15; $2,500 when the boathouse was completed; $5,000 when the
builder finished the digging of the channel.  

 Assume that the landowner paid the $2,500 on March 15 and that the builder completed the boathouse according to
specifications, but that the landowner then refused to pay the second installment and repudiated the contract.
Assume further that the absence of a writing is not raised as a defense.  Which of the following is correct?  

A: The builder has a cause of action against the landowner and his damages will be $2,500. 
B: The builder can refuse to dig the channel and not be liable for breach of contract. 
C: The builder can refuse to dig the channel, not be liable for breach of contract, and have a cause of action against
the landowner for which his damages will be $2,500. 
D: The builder can refuse to dig the channel but he will liable for breach of contract. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, an unequivocal statement of unwillingness or
inability to perform a future contractual obligation, if material, may be treated as a total breach of that obligation.  Once
a repudiation occurs, the non-repudiating party is discharged from any further performance under the contract and
may immediately recover damages for total breach.  When a contractor is injured due to an owner's total breach of a
construction contract, the contractor generally can recover his expected profit on the entire contract along with any
labor and material expenses incurred up until the time that he learned of the owner's breach, minus any progress
payments made by the owner.  Although the landowner repudiated the agreement just after the second $2,500
progress payment became due, the builder would be entitled to obtain as damages not only the progress payment but
also his expected profit on the entire contract.  Because these damages would exceed $2,500, answers A and C are
incorrect.  The builder is also entitled to withhold his remaining performance under the contract and will not be
considered in breach.  Therefore, answer D is incorrect, making B the correct answer.

Question 1369 - Contracts - Remedies (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

A collector bought from a gallery a painting correctly described in the parties' signed contract as a "one-of-a-kind self-
portrait" by a famous artist who had recently died. The contract price was $500,000 in cash, payable one month after
a truck carrier delivered the painting to the collector.   

The painting was damaged in transit. The collector timely rejected it after inspection, immediately notified the gallery of
the rejection, and told the gallery that the painting would be available for pickup. The gallery then sold the painting to a
third party. It informed the collector that it would pick up the painting within a couple of weeks. Two weeks later, before
the gallery picked up the painting, the collector sold and delivered the painting to an art admirer for $550,000 cash,
after notifying the admirer about the damage. The collector sent no money to the gallery.   

If the collector's sale of the painting was NOT an acceptance of the goods, what is the maximum amount that the
gallery is entitled to recover from the collector?  

A: $550,000 (damages for conversion). 
B: $500,000 (the collector-gallery contract price). 
C: $50,000 (the excess of the market price over the contract price). 
D: Only the allowance of lost profit to the gallery as a volume dealer. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct. The collector rightfully rejected the goods. However, the collector's exercise of ownership by
selling the painting, after his rejection, was wrongful against the gallery and constituted conversion. The remedy for
conversion is the fair market value of the goods at the time of the conversion. The collector's sale of the painting for
$550,000 provides credible evidence of the painting's fair market value at the time of the conversion. UCC §§ 2-601
cmt. 2, 1-103(b)   

Answer B is incorrect. The collector's exercise of ownership by selling the painting, after his rejection, was wrongful
against the gallery and constituted conversion. The gallery should not be limited to the contract price for determining
the value of the painting, because the remedy for conversion is the fair market value of the goods at the time of the
conversion, which occurred when the collector sold the painting for $550,000. UCC §§ 2-601 cmt. 2, 1-103(b)   

Answer C is incorrect. The collector's exercise of ownership by selling the painting, after his rejection, was wrongful
against the gallery and constituted conversion. The remedy for conversion is the fair market value of the goods at the
time of the conversion. The collector's sale of the painting for $550,000 provides credible evidence of the painting's
fair market value at the time of the conversion. UCC §§ 2-601 cmt. 2, 1-103(b)   

Answer D is incorrect. The collector's exercise of ownership by selling the painting, after his rejection, was wrongful
against the gallery and constituted conversion. The remedy for conversion is the fair market value of the goods at the
time of the conversion. The collector's sale of the painting for $550,000 provides credible evidence of the painting's
fair market value at the time of the conversion. In addition, the gallery is not a lost volume seller, because the painting
was a one-of-a-kind good, which means that the gallery was operating at full capacity. UCC §§ 2-601 cmt. 2, 1-103(b)

Question 188 - Contracts - Remedies (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

A buyer purchased 100 bolts of standard blue wool, No. 1 quality, from a seller.  The sales contract provided that the
buyer would make payment prior to inspection.  The 100 bolts were shipped, and the buyer paid the seller.  Upon
inspection, however, the buyer discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality.  The buyer thereupon tendered back the
wool to the seller and demanded return of his payment.  The seller refused on the ground that there is no difference
between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool.  

 Can the buyer resell the wool?  

A: Yes, in a private sale. 
B: Yes, in a private sale but only after giving the seller reasonable notice of his intention to resell. 
C: yes, but only at a public sale. 
D: No. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  Pursuant to UCC 2-711(3) and 2-706(3), the buyer had a security interest in the goods and had
a right to resell.  Thus, D is incorrect.  A is incorrect because the buyer's right to resell at a private sale exists only if
the seller is given reasonable notice.  C is incorrect because the sale may be either public or private - UCC 2-706(2).

Question 1030 - Contracts - Remedies (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

A tenant rented a commercial building from a landlord, and operated a business in it.  The building's large front
window was smashed by vandals six months before expiration of the tenant-landlord lease.  The tenant, who was
obligated thereunder to effect and pay for repairs in such cases, promptly contracted with a window company to
replace the window for $2,000, due 30 days after satisfactory completion of work.  The landlord was then unaware of
the tenant-window company contract.  The window company was aware that the building was under lease, but dealt
entirely with the tenant.  

 Sixty days after the window company's satisfactory completion of the window replacement, and prior to the expiration
of the tenant's lease, the tenant, then insolvent, ceased doing business and vacated the building.  In so doing, the
tenant forfeited under the lease provisions its right to the return of a $2,000 security deposit with the landlord.  The
deposit had been required, however, for the express purpose (as stated in the lease) of covering any damage to the
leased property except ordinary wear and tear.  The only such damage occurring during the tenant's occupancy was
the smashed window.  The window company's $2,000 bill for the window replacement is wholly unpaid.  

 Assuming that the window company has no remedy quasi in rem under the relevant state mechanic's lien statute,
which of the following would provide the window company's best chance of an effective remedy in personam against
the landlord?  

A: An action in quasi contract for the reasonable value of a benefit unofficiously and non-gratuitously conferred on the
landlord. 
B: An action based on promissory estoppel. 
C: An action based on an implied-in-fact contract. 
D: An action as third-party intended beneficiary of the tenant-landlord lease. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct.  Generally, a party that has made a contract with another cannot later disregard the contract and
bring suit in restitution against a third person, even if that third person has received a benefit from the contract.  For
example, where the window company has conferred a benefit (replaced the glass in the window) pursuant to its
contract with the tenant, it normally would not be able to recover in restitution from the landlord.  However, sometimes
recovery in restitution is possible, especially where the third person (the landlord) has not already paid someone else
for the work and the claimant's (the window company's) avenues to bring suit to enforce the contract have been
exhausted.  These and other factors suggest that restitution against the landlord would be just in this case: the tenant
is insolvent, the landlord collected on a $2,000 deposit that the tenant forfeited because of the broken window, and the
fact that the lease expressly contemplated the tenant fixing any damage to the property suggests that the landlord
would have requested the work if given the opportunity.  

 B is incorrect because the landlord made no promise on which the window company relied.  C is incorrect because
the landlord had no knowledge of the window company-tenant contract and therefore could not have implicitly
promised to do anything.  D is incorrect because on these facts, the window company would be, if anything, an
incidental beneficiary of the landlord-tenant contract.

Question 1356 - Contracts - Remedies (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

A buyer ordered a new machine from a manufacturer. The machine arrived on time and conformed in all respects to
the contract. The buyer, however, rejected the machine because he no longer needed it in his business and returned
the machine to the manufacturer. The manufacturer sold many such machines each year, and its factory was not
operating at full capacity.   

In an action by the manufacturer against the buyer for breach of contract, which of the following is NOT a proper
measure of the manufacturer's damages?  

A: The contract price of the machine. 
B: The difference between the contract price and the market price of the machine. 
C: The difference between the contract price and the price obtained from a proper resale of the machine. 
D: The profit the manufacturer would have made on the sale of the machine to the buyer. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct. The manufacturer does not have an action for the price. Such an action is available under three
circumstances, none of which is present here—(1) where the buyer has accepted the goods, (2) where the goods are
lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after the risk of loss has passed to the buyer, or (3) where the
buyer has returned or rejected the goods and the seller is unable after reasonable efforts to resell the goods. UCC §
2-709   

Answer B is incorrect. UCC § 2-708(1) gives a seller the right to recover the difference between the contract price and
the market price of goods when a buyer has wrongfully rejected the goods. Note, however, that because the
manufacturer is a lost volume seller, it would be better off seeking damages under UCC § 2-708(2), since it is unlikely
that a market differential formula will result in the recovery of any direct damages by the manufacturer with respect to
what appear to be standard goods.   

Answer C is incorrect. UCC &#2-706 allows a seller to recover the difference between the contract price and resale
price when a buyer has wrongfully rejected the goods. Note, however, that the manufacturer would be better off
seeking damages under UCC § 2-708(2), because it is a lost volume seller and it is unlikely that a resale will result in
the recovery of any direct damages by the manufacturer with respect to what appear to be standard goods.   

Answer D is incorrect. UCC § 2-708(2) provides the lost volume seller (a seller not operating at full capacity) with an
action to recover lost profit. A recovery under UCC § 2-708(2) would adequately compensate the manufacturer for its
direct damages.

Question 432 - Contracts - Remedies (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

On June 1, a manufacturer of men's neckties received the following order from a retailer: "Ship 500 two-inch ties,
assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34.  Delivery by July 1."  

 On June 1, the manufacturer shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at the retailer's place of business on June 3.
The retailer immediately telegraphed the manufacturer: "Reject your shipment.  Order was for two-inch ties."  The
retailer, however, did not ship the ties back to the manufacturer.  The manufacturer replied by telegram: "Will deliver
proper ties before July 1."  The retailer received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it.  

 On June 30, the manufacturer tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No.
V34, but the retailer refused to accept them.  

 Did the retailer properly reject the ties tendered on June 30?  

A: Yes, because the manufacturer's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was a present breach of contract. 
B: Yes, because the manufacturer's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was an anticipatory repudiation. 
C: No, because the manufacturer cured the June 1 defective delivery by his tender of conforming goods on June 30. 
D: No, because a contract for sale of goods can be modified without consideration. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct.  When the retailer rejected the ties, the agreed time for performance (July 1) had not expired.
Thus, the manufacturer, who had performed in good faith and who notified the retailer of an intent to cure by shipping
conforming ties, could do so as long as the conforming delivery was made within the agreed time.  UCC 2-508(1).  A
is incorrect because although the shipment on June 1 was a breach of contract, the manufacturer preserved the right
to cure before July 1. B is incorrect because anticipatory repudiation consists of an indication by the seller through
words or conduct that to contract would not be completed. Here, the manufacturer did the opposite and assured the
retailer that the proper ties would be delivered before July 1.  D is incorrect because the contract was not modified;
500 two-inch ties were delivered by July 1.

Question 410 - Contracts - Remedies (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A landowner owned Broadacres in fee simple.  For a consideration of $5,000, the landowner gave his neighbor a
written option to purchase Broadacres for $300,000.  The option was assignable.  For a consideration of $10,000, the
neighbor subsequently gave an option to his friend to purchase Broadacres for $325,000.  The friend exercised his
option.  

 The neighbor thereupon exercised his option.  The neighbor paid the agreed price of $300,000 and took title to
Broadacres by deed from the landowner.  Thereafter, the friend refused to consummate his purchase.  

 The neighbor brought an appropriate action against the friend for specific performance, or, if that should be denied,
then for damages.  The friend counterclaimed for return of the $10,000.  In this action the court will  

A: grant money damages only to the neighbor. 
B: grant specific performance to the neighbor. 
C: grant the neighbor only the right to retain the $10,000. 
D: require the neighbor to refund the $10,000 to the friend. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct.  An option promise is a promise not to revoke an offer to enter into a contract, and it requires
separate consideration to be enforceable.  When a party exercises an option, that party in effect accepts the offer and
binds himself to the contract.  The friend paid the neighbor $10,000 in exchange for the neighbor's promise not to
revoke his offer to sell.  When the friend exercised the option, he became obligated to purchase Broadacres for
$325,000, and his failure to consummate his purchase entitled the neighbor to pursue remedies for breach of contract.
 Specific performance generally will be awarded for breach of contract where an award of monetary damages would
be inadequate or impracticable.  Contracts involving the sale of land historically have been regarded as unique, and
therefore equitable relief traditionally has been allowed, even where the breaching party is the buyer.  Because the
obligation that the neighbor seeks to enforce is the friend's obligation to purchase Broadacres (a contract to purchase
land), specific performance will be awarded.  

 A is incorrect because the contract involves the sale of land, and therefore the neighbor will be awarded specific
performance.  C is incorrect because the neighbor not only is entitled to retain the option price, but he is also entitled
to a remedy for the friend's breach.  D is incorrect because the friend paid the $10,000 in exchange for the option.
Even if the friend failed to exercise the option, he cannot seek return of the purchase price once the option has been
given to him.

Question 187 - Contracts - Remedies (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A buyer purchased 100 bolts of standard blue wool, No. 1 quality, from a seller.  The sales contract provided that the
buyer would make payment prior to inspection.  The 100 bolts were shipped, and the buyer paid the seller.  Upon
inspection, however, the buyer discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality.  The buyer thereupon tendered back the
wool to the seller and demanded return of his payment.  The seller refused on the ground that there is no difference
between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool.  

 What is the buyer's remedy because the wool was nonconforming?  

A: Specific performance 
B: Damages measured by the difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of conforming goods 
C: Damages measured by the price paid plus the difference between the contract price and the cost of buying
substitute goods 
D: None, since he waived his remedies by agreeing to pay before inspection 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer C is correct because a buyer is entitled to reject nonconforming goods and to obtain damages pursuant to
UCC 2-712(2), which is calculated as the difference between the cost of cover for substitute goods and the contract
price.  A is incorrect because there are no facts to support a conclusion that blue wool No. 1 quality is unique or that
there are other proper circumstances pursuant to UCC 2-716(1), such as an inability to cover.  B is incorrect.  The
difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of conforming goods is the appropriate remedy
under UCC 2-714 for accepted goods.  This would be the remedy if the buyer kept the No. 2 wool; however, the buyer
tendered the goods back to the seller.  D is also incorrect because payment prior to inspection does not constitute an
acceptance or a waiver of any contract remedies under UCC 2-512(2).

Question 75 - Contracts - Remedies (2/7/2017) 

The question was:

On March 1, a computer programming company orally agreed with a department store to write a set of programs for
the department store's computer and to coordinate the programs with the department store's billing methods.  A
subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety:

  The department store will pay the computer programming company $20,000 in two equal installments within one
month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing
time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store's Zenon 747 computer; the computer
programming company to complete by July 1.  This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6,
the computer programming company demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done.  After the department
store denied liability, the parties orally agreed that the department store should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending
completion to the satisfaction of the department store's computer systems manager.  The escrow deposit was
thereupon made.  On July 5, the computer programming company completed the programs, having used an amount
of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs.  Tests by the computer
programming company and the department store's computer systems manager then showed that the computer
programs, not being perfectly coordinated with the department store's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47
percent.  They would, however, save the department store $12,000 a year.  Further, if the department store would
spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by the computer programming company,
the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58 percent, saving the department store another $8,000 a year.
The department store's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion.  The
department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the
computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs.

 Assume that the computer programming company's delay in completion did not give the department store the right to
renounce the contract and that the parties' escrow agreement was enforceable.  Is the computer programming
company entitled to recover damages for breach of the contract?

A: Yes, because the computer programming company had substantially performed.
B: Yes, because the program would save the department store $12,000 a year.
C: No, because shortening the processing time by one-half was an express condition subsequent.
D: No, because the department store's computer systems manager did not certify satisfactory completion of the
programs.

The explanation for the answer is:

Answer D is correct. For this question, it is assumed that the contract was not renounced because of the time delay
and that the escrow agreement was enforceable. The escrow agreement contained the express condition precedent
that the work must be completed to the satisfaction of the department store's computer systems manager. Generally,
failure to satisfy an express condition discharges performance.  However, when the condition is one of personal
satisfaction from one of the parties, and the contract involves personal judgment, the party whose satisfaction is
required must act honestly and in good faith. Here, the programming company performance was not to the satisfaction
of the store's computer systems manager, and the facts state that his refusal to certify satisfactory completion was
done in good faith. Therefore, the programming company failed to meet a valid express condition precedent and the
department store is excused from paying. Therefore, the programming company is not entitled to recover damages for
breach of contract, as the department store did not breach.

    A is incorrect because substantial performance will not satisfy as contract performance where an express condition
precedent has not been met.

    B is incorrect because the call of the question asks if the computer programming company can recover damages for
breach of contract, and there was no breach of contract by the department store. While the computer programming
company would be entitled to some compensation, possibly $12,000, in a quasi-contract action under the theory of
unjust enrichment, the question is asking about entitlement to damages based on breach of contract, not about
restitution where a contract has been held unenforceable.

    C is incorrect because the condition of shortening the processing time by one-half was waived when the parties
made the escrow agreement, and was replaced with the condition that the work be completed to the satisfaction of the
department store's computer systems manager.

Question 867 - Contracts - Remedies (2/11/2017) 

The question was: 

A woman owns an exceptionally seaworthy boat that she charters for sport fishing at a $500 daily rate.  The fee
includes the use of the boat with the woman as the captain, and one other crew member, as well as fishing tackle and
bait.  On May 1, a father agreed with the woman that the father would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for
himself and his family for $500.  The father paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the
deposit could be retained by the woman as liquidated damages in the event the father canceled or failed to appear.  

 At the time of contracting, the woman told the father to be at the dock at 5 a.m. on May 15.  The father and his family,
however, did not show up on May 15 until noon.  In the meantime, the owner of the boat agreed at 10 a.m. to take a
second family out fishing for the rest of the day.  The second family happened to come by and inquire about the
possibility of such an outing.  In view of the late hour, the owner of the boat charged the family $400 and stayed out
two hours beyond the customary return time.  The father's failure to appear until noon was due to the fact that he had
been trying to charter another boat across the bay at a lower rate and had gotten lost after he was unsuccessful in
getting such a charter.  

 Which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the rights of the parties?  

A: The woman can retain the $200 paid by the father, because it would be difficult for the woman to establish her
actual damages and the sum appears to have been a reasonable forecast in light of anticipated loss of profit from the
charter. 
B: The woman is entitled to retain only $50 (10% of the contract price) and must return $150 to the father. 
C: The woman must return $100 to the father in order to avoid her own unjust enrichment at the father's expense. 
D: The woman must return $100 to the father, because the liquidated-damage clause under the circumstances would
operate as a penalty. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct.  A party in breach generally is entitled to  restitution of any benefit that he has conferred in the
way of part performance in excess of the loss resulting from the breach.  Where the parties have agreed that the
breaching party's performance is to be retained as liquidated damages, the breaching party is not entitled to restitution
if the liquidated damages clause is reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual damages resulting from the breach
and the difficulty of proving damages.  Although the father may argue that the woman was unjustly enriched to the
extent that the deposit exceeded her actual loss, the woman should be able to retain the $200 deposit.  Damages
representing the inconvenience to the woman resulting from the father's failure to appear are difficult to estimate, and
$200 was a reasonable estimate of the anticipated opportunity cost to the woman of not taking other potential
customers.  

 B is incorrect because the common law rule on liquidated damages does not specify any maximum percentage.  C
and D are incorrect because the liquidated damages clause may be enforceable even if the amount of damages
specified in the clause exceeds the woman's actual loss.

Question 1111 - Contracts - Remedies (2/11/2017) 

The question was: 

On April 1, an owner and a buyer signed a writing in which the owner, in consideration of $100 to be paid to the owner
by the buyer, offered the buyer the right to purchase Greenacre for $100,000 within 30 days.  The writing further
provided, "This offer will become effective as an option only if and when the $100 consideration is in fact paid."  On
April 20, the owner, having received no payment or other communication from the buyer, sold and conveyed
Greenacre to a citizen for $120,000.  On April 21, the owner received a letter from the buyer enclosing a cashier's
check for $100 payable to the owner and stating, "I am hereby exercising my option to purchase Greenacre and am
prepared to close whenever you're ready."  

 Assume that, for whatever reason, the buyer prevails in the suit against the owner.  

 Which of the following is the buyer entitled to recover?  

A: Nominal damages only, because the remedy of specific performance was not available to the buyer. 
B: The fair market value, if any, of an assignable option to purchase Greenacre for $100,000. 
C: $20,000, plus the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of Greenacre on the date of the owner's breach
exceeded $120,000. 
D: The amount, if any, by which the fair market value of Greenacre on the date of the owner's breach exceeded
$100,000. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer D is correct.  Although breach of a contract for real estate typically would entitle the buyer to specific
performance, specific performance is not possible in this case because the property has been sold to the citizen.  As a
substitute for specific performance, the buyer may recover expectation damages, or damages that are intended to
give the injured party the value of the promise.  Damages to an injured buyer in a contract for the sale of real estate
are usually measured by the difference between the contract price and the market value of the property as of the time
that the buyer learned of the breach, plus any incidental or consequential damages.  So if the buyer prevails in her suit
against the owner, she may recover damages equal to the excess of the market value of Greenacre over the contract
price.  

 A is incorrect because the buyer is entitled to recover either specific performance or expectation damages.  B is
incorrect because the owner's breach ultimately has caused the buyer to lose Greenacre itself and not just an option
to purchase Greenacre.  C is incorrect because typically expectation damages are not measured by the better of the
contract price-resale price differential and the contract price-market value differential (although each of these is a
theoretically possible method of measuring expectation damages). 











Page 142

Question 242 - Contracts - Third-Party Rights (2/7/2017) 

The question was: 

A victim, injured by a driver in an auto accident, employed an attorney to represent him in the matter.  The victim was
chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment.  Accordingly,
the attorney wrote into their contract his promise to the victim "to pay from any settlement with the driver
compensation to any physician who provides professional services for the victim's injuries."  The contract also
provided that the attorney's duties were "non-assignable."  The attorney immediately filed suit against the driver.  The
victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at $1,000, from the doctor, but failed to inform
the doctor of the attorney's promise.  

 After receiving a bill from the doctor for $1,000, the victim immediately wrote the doctor explaining that he was unable
to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with the attorney.  

 The victim then asked the attorney about payment of this bill, but the attorney requested a release from their
employment contract, stating that he would like to refer the victim's claim to a colleague and that the colleague was
willing to represent the victim in the pending lawsuit.  The victim wrote a letter to the attorney releasing him from their
contract and agreeing to the colleague's representation.  A copy of this letter was sent to the doctor.  The colleague
subsequently promised the attorney to represent the victim and soon negotiated a settlement of the victim's claim
against the driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by the victim to creditors other than the doctor.  The
victim remains insolvent.  

 In an action by the doctor against the attorney upon the attorney's employment contract with the victim, if the attorney
attempted to use the victim's release as a defense, the doctor is likely to argue that  

A: the release was ineffective, because the doctor had impliedly assented to the victim-attorney contract. 
B: the release was ineffective, because the victim would thereby be unjustly enriched. 
C: there was no consideration for the victim's release of the attorney.  
D: the attorney's contract duties were too personal to be effectively delegated to the colleague.  

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended
beneficiary until the beneficiary's rights vest. Rights vest when the beneficiary: (1) manifests assent to the promise, (2)
sues to enforce the promise, or (3) materially changes position in reliance on the promise. Here, the doctor was an
intended beneficiary of the agreement between the victim and the attorney. Although the doctor received notice of the
promise before the victim and the attorney executed the release, he never expressly assented to the promise.
However, the doctor can argue that by not pursuing the victim and waiting to collect from the attorney, the doctor
impliedly assented to the contract and that assent made the release ineffective.  

   B is incorrect because unjust enrichment is not relevant to the question of whether the attorney was released, and
would only be relevant in a quasi-contract action against the victim. C is incorrect because the colleague's promise to
represent the victim supplied sufficient consideration to support the promise to release the attorney. D is incorrect
because the question of whether the attorney's duties may be freely delegated is irrelevant since the victim assented
to the delegation.

Question 1397 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons (7/22/2016) 

The question was: 

A state grand jury investigating a murder learned that the key suspect might have kept a diary. The grand jury issued
a subpoena duces tecum requiring the suspect to produce any diary. The subpoena made clear that the grand jury
was seeking only the diary and not any testimony from the suspect. The suspect refused to produce the diary, citing
the privilege against self-incrimination.   

Under what circumstances, if any, may the grand jury compel production of the diary over the suspect's assertion of
his Fifth Amendment privilege?  

A: It may compel production without granting immunity because the suspect was not compelled to write a diary. 
B: It may compel production only if the suspect is granted use and derivative use immunity from the act of production. 
C: It may compel production only if the suspect is granted transactional immunity. 
D: It may not compel production of a private diary under any circumstances. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer B is correct. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination protects only testimonial or
communicative evidence, and not real or physical evidence. Therefore, it protects acts of production that would have
testimonial significance by authenticating documents. Thus, Answer A is incorrect.  

 However, a criminal defendant may be compelled to produce documents that have testimonial significance if
immunity is granted to the defendant. There are two kinds of immunity that may be granted. The broader form of
immunity is "transactional immunity." Transactional immunity completely protects the witness from future prosecution
for crimes related to his or her testimony. "Use and derivative use" immunity is narrower--it prevents the prosecution
only from using the witness's own testimony or any evidence derived from the testimony against the witness.
However, should the prosecutor acquire evidence substantiating the supposed crime--independently of the witness's
testimony--the witness may then be prosecuted for the same.  

 Here, Answer B is correct because use and derivative use immunity sufficiently protects the constitutional privilege
against self-incrimination in this situation. Thus, Answer C is incorrect because the prosecution does not need to grant
the suspect transactional immunity--use and derivative use immunity sufficiently protects the constitutional privilege
against self-incrimination.  

 Answer D is incorrect because the suspect's privilege against self-incrimination may be overcome if the suspect is
granted use and derivative use immunity. 












Page 144

Question 1323 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons (7/23/2016) 

The question was: 

A federal grand jury that was investigating drug trafficking in the jurisdiction subpoenaed a witness to testify. The
prosecutor advised the witness that he had a Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify if he so chose. The witness
asked that his attorney be allowed to advise him inside the grand jury room, but the prosecutor refused to allow the
attorney inside. After speaking with his attorney outside the grand jury room, the witness decided to testify. During his
testimony, he made self-incriminating statements.   

The witness was subsequently indicted for drug crimes. The indictment was based on the witness's grand jury
testimony and on evidence seized in an unconstitutional search of the witness's home.   

The witness has moved to dismiss the indictment.   

Should the court dismiss the indictment?  

A: Yes, because the witness was denied his constitutional right to advice of counsel. 
B: Yes, because the indictment was based upon illegally seized evidence. 
C: No, because the witness waived his constitutional rights by testifying. 
D: No, because the witness had no right to counsel inside the grand jury room and the illegally seized evidence did
not affect the validity of the indictment. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer D is correct. A grand jury witness does not have a constitutional right to counsel inside a grand jury room.
See Connecticut v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 292 (1999) (citing United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564 (1976)).
Thus, Answer A is incorrect. Also, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to federal grand juries and
is not a basis upon which a federal indictment can be dismissed. United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338 (1974).
Thus, Answer B is incorrect, and Answer D is correct.   

Answer C is incorrect. The issue here does not turn on waiver, nor do the facts demonstrate a waiver of any
constitutional rights. Rather, wholly apart from any waiver, none of the witness's constitutional rights were violated: a
grand jury witness does not have a constitutional right to counsel inside a grand jury room, and the Fourth
Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to federal grand juries.

Question 1472 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons (7/23/2016) 

The question was: 

A defendant was charged with the capital offense of first-degree murder, for which the only available penalties were
death or life in prison without parole. During jury selection, the trial court, over the defendant's objection, granted the
prosecution's for-cause challenge of five prospective jurors who indicated upon questioning by both parties that they
personally were opposed to the death penalty and were unsure if they could ever vote to impose it. The jury convicted
the defendant and, following a separate sentencing hearing, sentenced him to death.  

 On appeal, the defendant's only argument was that excusing the prospective jurors violated his federal constitutional
right to be tried by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of the community.  

 How should the court of appeals rule on the conviction and the death sentence?  

A: Affirm both. 
B: Affirm the conviction, but reverse the death sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing before a different
jury. 
C: Affirm the conviction, but reverse the death sentence and remand for resentencing to life in prison. 
D: Reverse both. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

Answer A is correct. A trial court properly may excuse a juror for cause from serving in both the guilt and penalty
phases of a capital case if a juror's views regarding the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the juror
from impartially deciding whether the death penalty is warranted in that particular case. Exclusion of such jurors does
not violate the fair cross-section right of the Sixth Amendment. To establish such a violation, the defendant must show
the underrepresentation of a distinct and numerically significant group in the venire to show his jury trial right was
violated. Thus, Answer A is correct, and Answers B, C, and D are incorrect.

Question 619 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons (7/23/2016) 

The question was: 

Police received information from an undercover police officer that she had just seen two men (whom she described) in
a red pickup truck selling marijuana to schoolchildren near the city's largest high school.  A few minutes later, two
police officers saw a pickup truck fitting the description a half block from the high school.  The driver of the truck
matched the description of one of the men described by the undercover officer.  

 The only passenger was a young woman who was in the back of the truck.  The police saw her get out and stand at a
nearby bus stop.  They stopped the truck and searched the driver.  In the pocket of the driver's jacket, the police found
a small bottle of pills that they recognized as narcotics.  They then broke open a locked toolbox attached to the flatbed
of the truck and found a small sealed envelope inside.  They opened it and found marijuana.  They also found a
quantity of cocaine in the glove compartment.  

 After completing their search of the driver and the truck, the police went over to the young woman and searched her
purse.  In her purse, they found a small quantity of heroin.  Both the driver and the young woman were arrested and
charged with unlawful possession of narcotics.  

 If the driver moves to suppress the use as evidence of the marijuana and cocaine found in the search of the truck, the
court should  

A: grant the motion as to both the marijuana and the cocaine. 
B: grant the motion as to the marijuana but deny it as to the cocaine. 
C: deny the motion as to the marijuana but grant it as to the cocaine. 
D: deny the motion as to both the marijuana and the cocaine. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

The correct answer is D.  Under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, the
police may properly search a vehicle, including any containers contained therein, that might contain the evidence they
seek without first obtaining a warrant.  Therefore, if the police have reason to believe there is illegal contraband in the
car, they can search the entire car for the contraband.   

 Here, a police officer reported that the driver of the vehicle was selling marijuana, and gave a description of the truck
and the driver.  This information gave the two police officers the probable cause needed to search a vehicle matching
the description. The automobile exception allows the warrantless search of the vehicle, of any container in the vehicle
which may contain the evidence sought, and the belongings of the people inside the vehicle. The police were thus
constitutionally permitted to search the glove compartment, the locked toolbox, and the sealed envelope for more
evidence of marijuana. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because the automobile exception allows for a warrantless
search of the entire car and any compartment that might contain the marijuana as long as there is probable cause for
the search.

Question 661 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons (7/23/2016) 

The question was: 

A man entered the police station and announced that he wanted to confess to a murder.  The police advised the man
of his Miranda rights, and the man signed a written waiver.  The man described the murder in detail and pinpointed
the location where a murder victim had been found a few weeks before.  Later, a court-appointed psychiatrist
determined that the man was suffering from a serious mental illness that interfered with his ability to make rational
choices and to understand his rights and that the psychosis had induced his confession.  

 The man's confession is  

A: admissible, because there was no coercive police conduct in obtaining the man's statement. 
B: admissible, because the man was not in custody. 
C: inadmissible, because the man's confession was a product of his mental illness and was therefore involuntary. 
D: inadmissible, because under these circumstances, there was no valid waiver of Miranda warnings. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

The correct answer is A.  The exclusionary rule is a rule meant to deter police conduct that would violate the
protections afforded to the accused in the Constitution, and suppressing the evidence in this case would serve no
purpose in enforcing those constitutional rights.  Because there was no coercive police conduct in obtaining the man's
statement, the statement should not be suppressed, and the confession is admissible.  

 Answer B is incorrect because it ignores the non-coercive effect of the police conduct, and the man may well have
been in custody at the time of the interrogation.  Answer C is incorrect because the scope of the exclusionary rule
does not include the right of the defendant to confess to a crime only when totally rational and properly motivated.
There must be some type of coercive police activity necessary to find that the man's confession was not voluntary and
inadmissible.  Answer D is incorrect because the protections of Miranda, as well as the exclusionary rule, will only
apply to cases involving police misconduct; the confession was voluntarily given here.  This analysis derives from the
United States Supreme Court case of Colorado v. Connelly.

Question 1164 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons (7/23/2016) 

The question was: 

FBI agents, without a warrant and without permission of Mexican law enforcement or judicial officers, entered Mexico,
kidnapped an American citizen wanted in the United States for drug smuggling violations, and forcibly drove him back
to Texas.  Thereafter, the agents, again without a warrant, broke into the Texas home of a woman wanted as a
confederate of the kidnapped person, and arrested her.  

 The kidnapped person and the woman were both indicted for narcotics violations.  Both moved to dismiss the
indictment on the ground that their arrests violated the Fourth Amendment.  

 The court should  

A: grant the motions of both the kidnapped person and the woman. 
B: grant the motion of the kidnapped person and deny the motion of the woman. 
C: grant the motion of the woman and deny the motion of the kidnapped person. 
D: deny the motions of both the kidnapped person and the woman. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

The correct answer is D.  An unlawful arrest does not serve an adequate reason to dismiss an indictment.  Although
the kidnapped person and the woman may have been arrested in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the remedy for
that violation is not the dismissal of the indictment against them.  Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because the
remedies for an unlawful arrest do not include the dismissal of an indictment against properly charged defendants.
Regardless of the propriety of the arrest, a court will not dismiss an otherwise properly obtained indictment.

Question 1107 - Criminal Law - Constitutional Protection of Accused Persons (7/24/2016) 

The question was: 

A defendant entered a guilty plea to a charge of embezzlement.  Her attorney hired a retired probation officer as a
consultant to gather information for the preparation of a sentencing plan for the defendant that would avoid jail.  For
that purpose, the consultant interviewed the defendant for three hours.  

 Thereafter, the prosecution undertook an investigation of the defendant's possible involvement in other acts of
embezzlement.  The consultant was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury.  The consultant refused to answer any
questions concerning her conversation with the defendant.  The prosecution has moved for an order requiring her to
answer those questions.  

 The motion should be  

A: denied, on the basis of the attorney-client privilege. 
B: denied, due to the absence of probable cause to believe the interview developed evidence relevant to the grand
jury's inquiry. 
C: granted, because the consultant is not an attorney. 
D: granted, because exclusionary evidentiary rules do not apply in grand jury proceedings. 

The explanation for the answer is: 

The correct answer is A.  The attorney-client privilege extends not only to discussions between the attorney and the
client, but also to any who are advised of confidential information at the direction of the attorney, including consultants
and investigators.  The information the consultant obtained was confidential information gathered at the direction of
the defendant's attorney and in the preparation for a criminal case, and is thus privileged.  The consultant cannot be
ordered to divulge privileged information.  

 Answer B is incorrect because there is no requirement that there exist probable cause to believe the evidence is
relevant before the inquiry can be made before the grand jury.  Answer C is incorrect because the attorney-client
privilege extends not only to the attorney, but also to confidential information garnered at the attorney's request.
Answer D is incorrect because some evidence rules, including allegations of privilege, do apply to grand jury
proceedings.

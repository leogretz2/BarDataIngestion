Tammy Fayray had been a hardworking and
loyal employee of Staged Entertainment
(Staged), an organization that produces pup 
pet shows, for over 28 years. Tammy was
the leading puppeteer for Baker and was well
known for her work entertaining people of
all ages with a puppet she created, named
"Jimmy." After receiving Tammy's sudden
and unexpected notice of retirement, Mr.
Baker, the owner of Staged, promised
Tammy $500.00 per month for the rest of
her life, in appreciation of Tammy's "28
years of outstanding creative efforts and
skills" for Staged. Tammy cried out, "Thank
you, this is the biggest surprise I've ever
gotten!" Tammy knew, during her employ 
ment with Staged, that it never had any re 
tirement plan for any of its employees.

Intending to splurge on herself, Tammy im 
mediately went out and purchased a lynx fur
coat. She incurred an installment payment
of $600.00 per month for 10 years, after ap 
plying her entire savings of $20,000.00 as a
down payment. Tammy would never have
purchased the coat had Mr. Baker not prom 
ised to pay her the money for life. Mr. Baker
disapproves of personal indulgence and
stopped the payments to Tammy after he
discovered Tammy's purchase of the coat.
Mr. Baker had sent Tammy the funds for 18
months at the time he discontinued his pay 
ments to Tammy.

Mayor and the Governor are making the fi 
nal arrangements to move the state hockey
team, the "Knuckleheads," to City. The
ten-acre proposed site is very close to 1st
and Meridian. Various general contractors
are submitting bids to construct the sports
complex. Girkin spends a large amount of
money hiring marketing consultants and
improving the restaurant at 1st and Merid 
ian. After spending nearly all his savings,
Girkin is invited to the Governor's mansion.
Very late into the evening, he notices the
Governor and Mayor engaged in a serious
discussion. Girkin gets within earshot to
hear, "Well, now that the sport complex deal
has been finalized, let's start our downtown
renovation program." Girkin gets himself
into the conversation and excitedly exclaims,
"It's finally going to happen!" Both the
Mayor and the Governor nod yes. GK, Inc.,
one of the general contractors, is awarded
the contract to build the sports complex by
Mayor. SK Enterprises is an electrical sub 
contractor who provided a subcontracting
bid upon which GK, Inc. 's bid is based.

21.

If SK Enterprises fails to perform, can
Mayor sue GK, Inc.?

A. No, because Mayor had no do 
native intent towards the SK En 
terprises.

B. No, because Mayor would be a
creditor beneficiary if she had
advanced salary to GK, Inc.

C. Yes, because Mayor would be a

creditor beneficiary.

vested rights in the contract be 
tween SK Enterprises and GK,
Inc.

as the general contractor is not
responsible for the breach of sub 
contractors.

subcontractor, is the obligor.

C. Yes, if Mayor and GK, Inc. have
a valid enforceable contract.

D. Yes, if GK, Inc. and SK Enter 
prises had a valid enforceable
contract.

23.

fire, and there is a lack of adequate in 
surance because of Mayor's negligence,
can Girkin sue as a third party benefi 
ciary?

A. Yes, if the negligence of the two

tortfeasors are proven in court.

CONTRACTS m

B. No, because Mayor is an offi 

cious intermeddler.

C. No, Girkin did not have the right

to receive any duty.

D. No, the agreement of Mayor and
GK, Inc. can vitiate any vested
rights Girkin had.

24. SK Enterprises completes work accord 
ing to the sub-contract. Mayor does not
pay GK; so GK does not pay SK. SK
Enterprises sues Mayor. What is the
most likely outcome?

A. Mayor's damages will be offset
by any breach of GK, Inc.

B. Mayor's damages will be offset
by any breach of SK Enterprises.

C. SK Enterprises has suffered a

"legal" detriment.

beneficiary to the Mayor/GK,
Inc. agreement.

25. Mayor proposes that the business
around the sports complex area be
painted with a color scheme coordi 
nated to that of the Knucklehead's uni 
forms. Because this would mean that
Girkin's restaurant would have to re 
paint and change all of the food pack 
aging, Girkin is opposed to the Mayor's
renovation plan for the sports complex
area. In a 6-to-1 decision, the city coun 
cil votes in the Mayor's plan. Does

mative nod he received at the party and
the reliance upon it?

A. Yes, Girkin has suffered a bar 
gained-for legal detriment.

B. Yes, Girkin has reasonably re 

lied.

C. Yes, mayor should have known
by Girkin's exclamation that he
would rely.

D. No, the communication between
the parties has not yet reached a
point where vesting could occur
in Girkin.

ciate delivery of 25 cases in October and 25
cases in November, if possible."

40. According to the facts, could Canco

would remain open.

B. No, because both parties are

merchants.

C. Yes, because there was no con 
sideration for keeping the offer
open.

D. Yes, since Grocer relied to its

detriment.

41. Grocer's fax on September 1 had the

following effect:

III CONTRACTS

A.

B.

It had no legal effect because the
mode of acceptance was not the
same as Canco's offer.

It operates as a reflection of the
offer and creates a counter-offer,
since Grocer changed the terms.

C. A contract for 50 cases of com

was formed.

D. A contract for 50 cases of com
was formed for delivery in Oc 
tober and November.

Questions 42 - 43 are based on the
following facts:

Shoe Heaven ordered 1000 pairs of
children's shoes in specified sizes and styles
from Cobbler Distributing. Delivery was
requested on May 1, with payment to be due
30 days from delivery. Cobbler found it
could only fill the order to the extent of 900
pairs. Without communicating with Shoe
Heaven, Cobbler shipped the 900 pairs of
shoes. On receipt of the shoes on April 30,
Shoe Heaven rejected the shipment.

42. Assuming that Cobbler is now suing
Shoe Heaven for breach of contract,
which of the following is the most likely
outcome?

A. Judgment will be for Cobbler
because he substantially per 
formed.

B. Judgment will be for Cobbler,
but Shoe Heaven will be entitled
to set off any damages attribut 
able to the non-delivery of the
100 pairs of shoes.

C. Judgment will be for Shoe
Heaven because Cobbler had not
filled the order according to its
specified terms.

D. Judgment will be for Shoe
Heaven, but only because a 10%
deficiency in the amount deliv 
ered would be considered a sub 
stantial failure of performance.

CONTRACTS iii

43. Assume for this question only, that Shoe
Heaven accepted the shipment of 900
pairs of shoes and gave notice to Cob 
bler that the shipment was incomplete.
Upon receiving no reply, Shoe Heaven
brought suit against Cobbler for dam 
ages caused by Cobbler's failure to de 
liver the remaining 100 pairs of shoes.
Which of the following is the most
likely outcome?

A. Shoe Heaven will recover dam 

ages against Cobbler.

B. Shoe Heaven will recover, but
only if Cobbler's failure to de 
liver the remaining 100 pairs of
shoes could be considered a ma 
terial breach.

C. Shoe Heaven will not recover
because it waived Cobbler's
breach by accepting the 900 pairs
of shoes.

D. Shoe Heaven will not recover
because Cobbler shipped the
shoes it had.

44. Liz, owner of Fabco, and Sally, man 
ager of Silk Creations, had a phone con 
versation, during which an agreement
was reached that Sally would buy 500
yards of silk at $10 per yard from Liz.
Liz then sent a signed letter to Sally to
confIrm the transaction. The letter omit 
ted the price term. A month later, Liz
called to confirm the date of delivery,
but was told by Sally that she did not
need the order. Assuming that Liz sues
Sally for a breach of contract, what is
the most likely outcome?

A. There will be judgment for Sally
because the written confirmation
was not signed by the party to
be charged.

B. There will be judgment for Sally
because the confirmation was
insufficient since the price was
omitted.

C. There will be judgment for Sally
because Liz did not verify the
order with Sally within 10 days
of sending the confirmation.

D. There will be judgment for Liz
because both parties are mer 
chants.

m CONTRACTS

45. Robin is considering buying a 4-wheel
drive truck, but is concerned about
rollover safety. She asks Cal about the
rollover safety of the new Forge truck.
Cal assures Robin that all Forge trucks
have always come with an integral
rollbar built into the cab structure, as
shown in Forge's brochure. The bro 
chure explains that the cab provides
complete rollover protection.

Robin's friend, Martin, rolled an iden 
tical Forge truck the prior week when
she was off-roading and was seriously
injured when the cab was completely
crushed. Robin knew of Martin's acci 
dent, but purchased the Forge truck,
because she thought Cal was a convinc 
ing salesman. Robin rolls her truck and
is also injured. She sues Forge for her
injuries, who prevails?

A. Robin, since Forge made an ex 
press warranty on which she re 
lied.

B . Robin, since her car was totaled.

C. Forge, since Robin could not
have relied on the affirmation in
entering the contract.

D. Forge, since Cal actually made
the representations to Robin.

46. Smith, a commercial real estate broker,
traveled quite frequently in order to
consummate real estate sales. Late one
night, while returning home to Califor 
nia from a business trip, in which Smith
had sold a $2.1 billion dollar commer 
cial building, he left his brief case in
the baggage claim area at the airport.
The next morning, Smith realized that
he had left his brief case at the airport.
He phoned the airport to see if anyone
had turned in his brief case, but the se 
curity desk told Smith nobody had
turned his brief case in to "Lost and
Found." Smith, desperate to get his brief
case back, since it had all the legal pa 
pers from his $2.1 billion dollar sale,
posted flyers all around the airport. The
flyers stated:

"Lost - one black brief case,
contains the name 'Smith.' Will
pay $500.00 to anyone for its
return. Call (213) 555-2645."

Early that evening, Ethel, who had just
arrived to California, read the flyer
posted in the arriving area while she was
waiting, for some friends to pick her up.
After an hour of waiting, she went to
the baggage claim area to claim her lug 
gage. Her friends were in the baggage
area waiting her arrival. Ethel, retrieved
all her bags and noticed the black brief
case described on the flyer on the lug 
gage carousel. She picked up the brief
case, tore a lost flyer off the wall and
left the airport with her friends.

CONTRACTS iii

A few days later, Smith realized that he
had put those legal papers in his suit 
case. Since he had found the papers and
the brief case was worth less than
$500.00, he decided that he did not need
the return of the brief case. As Smith
was on his way out the door to go to
the airport to take down the posted fly 
ers, Ethel called regarding the brief case
that she had found. She asked Smith,
"Did you lose a black brief case at the
airport?" Before anything else was said
by Ethel, Smith replied, "I thought I had
left important legal papers in the brief
case that I was working on, but I've
found the papers." He further stated that
he was just leaving to pull all the flyers
from the airport in cancellation of the
reward offer. If Ethel claims the $500.00
reward from Smith, she will:

A. Recover, because a contract was
formed when she called Smith to
return his brief case.

B. Recover, because Smith created
a unilateral contract upon the
posting of the flyers, and once
Ethel performed, it became irre 
vocable.

C. Not recover, because no contract

following facts:

On September 1, X wrote a letter to Y, an
acquaintance of his, stating, "I'm in need of
a truck for transportation for my business
and will buy your 'YO' truck for $10,000,
upon you bringing it to my office at 1313
Capitol Street in Anaheim, on or before Sep 
tember 6." On September 3, Y received the

truck for $7,000. Y replied to Z that he would
think about his offer of purchase and would
get back to him in a few days.

On September 6, at 9:00 a.m., Y arrived at
X's business, but X was not there. At 11 :00
a.m., X arrived and refused to buy Y's truck,
because he already purchased a truck and
had no need for two trucks. Y sues X for
breach of contract.

was formed.

47. What legal effect did Y's letter have?

letter.

C. The letter had no legal effect, al-
lowing X to revoke his offer.

D. The September 2nd letter would
only be an acceptance had X re-
ceived Y's letter.

48. What is the legal effect of Z's conver-

sation with Y?

A. There is no legal effect because
X's offer was irrevocable.

B. There is no legal effect because
Z was making an offer to pur-
chase Y's truck.

C. Z's conversation with Y termi-
nated X's original offer, and op-
erated as an offer for Z to pur-
chase Y's truck for $7,000.

D. The conversation operated as a
termination of Y's power of ac-
ceptance of X's offer.

Questions 49 - 50 are based on the
following facts:

Jack, a retired Olympic swimmer, decided
to follow through with his long-time dream
to build a large indoor swimming pool for
the purpose of training youngsters for com 
petition. Dan orally contracted with Jack on
March 10 to build the pool, spectator bleach 
ers and a parking lot. Bill has already orally
agreed to permit the building of a parking
lot on his property that is adjacent to Jack's
property. Dan agreed to begin work on the
project on March 20, and to complete the
work by June 15, in time for summer. The
total price of the job is $28,000, to be paid
in three installments: $13,000 on March 20,
$5,000 when the pool and bleachers are com 
pleted, and $10,000 when Dan finishes with
the parking lot.

49. Assume that Jack tendered the $13,000
on March 20, and that Dan refused to
accept it, or perform. If Jack sues Dan
for breach of contract, which defense(s)
can Dan successfully use?

A. The Jack-Bill agreement was not

in writing.

B. The Jack-Dan agreement was not

50. Assume that Jack paid the $13,000 on
March 20, and that Dan completed the
pool and bleachers, according to speci-
fications. However, Jack then refused
to pay the second installment, and re-
pudiates the contract. Which of the fol-
lowing is correct?

A. Dan has a cause of action against
Jack for $5,000 in damages.

B. Dan can refuse to finish the park-
ing lot, and not be liable for
breach of contract.

C. Both A and B.

D. Neither A nor B.

51. Bar Candidate orally agreed to sell his
bar materials to Student for $1,500. Bar
Candidate explained to Student that he
was only interested in selling the mate-
rials to Student if Bar Candidate passes
the bar exam. For that reason, the par-
ties also agreed that the transaction
would not take effect unless Bar Can-
didate passed his bar exam. After two
weeks had lapsed, Bar Candidate and
Student reduced their agreement into a
writing, but no mention was made that
the sale would be contingent upon Bar
Candidate passing his bar exam.

In an action by Student against Bar
Candidate for breach of contract, how
should the court rule on Bar Candidate's
offer of proof that he did not pass his
bar exam?

72 CONTRACTS

A. The evidence is admissible be-
cause Bar Candidate's purpose of
the contract was frustrated.

B. The evidence is admissible be-
cause the final writing was not a
full integration of the parties oral
agreement.

C. The evidence is barred because

of the Statute of Frauds.

D. The evidence is barred because
the oral agreement contradicts
the written agreement.

52. Seller, contracted in writing to deliver
to Buyer, 10,000 cartons of milk on
May 1 at $ 1.00 a carton. Because the
farmers who supplied Seller with his
milk did not deliver enough milk, Seller
only had 9,000 cartons of milk to ful-
fill his contract with Buyer. If Seller
tenders only 9,000 cartons of milk to
Buyer on May 1, and Buyer refuses to
accept, or pay for any, which is the best
statement regarding their contractual
relationship?

A. The doctrine of impossibility of
performance excuses Seller from
performing the contact.

B. Seller can sue Buyer since he
substantially performed the con-
tract.

C. Buyer is obligated to give Seller

time to cure. 


D. Buyer has a cause of action
against Seller for Seller's failure
to deliver 10,000 cartons of milk.

53. Miller started a car wash in Columbus,
Ohio. He leased his equipment from
Americo in 1987, under a five-year
lease which was renewable for 3
one-year periods. At the end of eight
years, Americo would "abandon" the
equipment to Miller (he would have
paid for it in full). In May 1991, Miller
defaulted. Americo repossessed and re 
sold the equipment. Americo claims it
is owed $2,000 by Miller, under a lease
provision which provides that Americo
could collect 10% of the equipment's
total cost in the event of any default.
Miller claims the liquidated damages
clause is invalid. Is the liquidated dam 
ages clause valid?

A. Yes, because there was a meet 

ing of the minds.

B. Yes, because it is to determine
whether or not Miller would de 
fault at the inception of the lease.

C. No, because a 10% liquidated
damages clause in any contract
is unconscionable as a matter of
law.

D. No, because the damages to
Americo would not be difficult
to ascertain.

Questions 54 - 55 are based on the
following facts:

In a written contract, Manufacturer agreed
to deliver to Baker, 200 described chairs at
$100 each EO.B., at Manufacturer's place
of business. The contract provided that "nei 
ther party will assign the contract without
written consent of the other." Manufacturer
placed the chairs on the carrier on August
31. On September 1, Manufacturer in a
signed writing, assigned to Wheeler all his
rights under the Manufacturer-Baker con 
tract. On September 3, the chairs were de 
stroyed by fire while in transit.

54.

In an action by Wheeler against Baker
for breach of contract, Wheeler will re 
cover:

A. $20,000, the contract price.

B. The difference between the con 
tract price and the market value
of the chairs.

C. Nothing, because the chairs had

not been delivered.

D. Nothing, because the Manufac 
turer and Baker contract forbid
an assignment.

55.

In an action by Baker against Manufac 
turer for breach of contract, Barker will
probably:

A. Succeed, since the risk of loss

was on Manufacturer.

CONTRACTS &I

57. The Bank of Commerce Inc. ("BCI")
loaned the Bombay Company $1 mil 
lion for the manufacture of a new type
of computer chip. As a condition of the
loan, Wendy Wonder, a majority share 
holder in Bombay, agreed in writing to
personally guarantee the loan. There 
after, Bombay defaulted on the loan and
entered into a repayment agreement
with BCL This agreement provided that
BCI would "use maximum efforts in
selling Bombay's assets at the highest
possible price." BCI proceeded to sell
Bombay's assets, discharging the in 
debtedness of the Bombay Company.

Later, it was ascertained that BCI did
not realize the "highest possible price"
in administering the sale of Bombay's
assets. Consequently, Wendy was
forced into bankruptcy and lost her en 
tire investment in the Bombay Com 
pany.

Wendy brings an appropriate action
against BCI to recover her investment
in Bombay's stock. She will most
likely:

A. Not prevail, because Wendy was
an incidental beneficiary of the
BCI sale of Bombay's assets.

B. Not prevail, because BCl's sale
of Bombay's assets discharged
whatever contractual relation 
ship existed between Wendy and
the bank.

B. Succeed, since the contract was

not assigned.

C. Not succeed, since the risk of

loss was on Baker.

D. Not succeed, since the chairs
were destroyed making it impos 
sible for Manufacturer to per 
form.

56. Billy Joe, a disabled veteran, contracted
to purchase a certain piece of land from
Jermey. The property consisted of a
1.65-acre home site, and an 80-acre
tract of land containing the famous tour 
ist attraction, "Blue Lagoon". Billy was
excited because he could now be a ho 
meowner and receive income in order
to pay the land payments and his living
expenses. After BillyJoe purchased the
property, he discovered that the home
site was on Federal Reserve Land, and
that the income from the lagoon was
$36,000 rather than $39,000 as repre 
sented. Billy Joe sued Jermey. Billy Joe
can:

1. Recover money damages

only.

II. Rescind the contract.

A. I only.

B.

II only.

C. lor II.

D. Neither I nor II.

III CONTRACTS

C. Prevail, because BCI did not re 
alize the highest possible price
from the sale of Bombay's assets.

D. Prevail, because BCI breached
its fiduciary duty to Wendy un 
der the terms of the BCI-Bombay
contract.

Questions 58 - 59 are based on the
following facts:

On January 5, Prevention Company, a manu 
facturer of steel security blinds for homes,
received the following order from Lion
Homes: "Please ship 500 4' x 6' security shut 
ters. Delivery by March 10."

On February 10, Prevention shipped 500 4'
x 8' security shutters, which were received
by Lion on February 12. The following day
Lion's foreman, Dave White, sent the fol 
lowing fax to Prevention's president, John

is rejected. Order stipulated 4' x 6' security
shutters." The fax was received by John
Smallwood on February 15. Lion, however,
did not ship the nonconforming shutters back
to Prevention.

On February 16, Mr. Smallwood sent the
following telegram to Mr. White: "Will ship
conforming security shutters before March
1." This telegram was received by Mr. White
on February 17, but he did not respond to it.
On March 7, Prevention tendered the 500
shutters of proper size to Lion, which were
refused.

58. Did Lion properly refuse the first ship 
ment delivered on February l2?

A. No, because Lion waived its
right to reject the nonconform 
ing goods by not returning them.

CONTRACTS iii

Questions 60 - 61 are based on the
following facts:

Tom wanted to have a security system in 
stalled in his home. He contacted several
companies and had them submit bids for the
installation of the system. SecureCo, in tum,
requested bids from several wholesalers for
prices of burglar alarm components which
it planned to use if awarded the job. BurgCo
submitted a bid to SecureCo that was used
in computing the bid for Tom.

On October 1, SecureCo sent Tom its bid,
of $5,000 for the security system and its in 
stallation. On October 9, BurgCo notified
SecureCo that they would be unable to sup 
ply any burglar alarm components to
SecureCo. On October 11, Tom sent the fol 
lowing telegram to SecureCo, "I hereby ac 
cept your offer to install the security system
for $5,000."

SecureCo had to pay another wholesaler
$1,000 above the quoted price by BurgCo
for the burglar alarm components. As a re 
sult, SecureCo advised Tom that the total
price for the job would be $6,000. Tom re 
plied that he would hold SecureCo to the
price stated in the submitted bid. SecureCo
went ahead and installed the security sys 
tem.

60.

In an action by SecureCo against Tom,
SecureCo will be able to recover:

A. $5,000, because that was the con 

tract price.

B. No, because Prevention could
accept Lion's offer by prompt
shipment of either conforming or
nonconforming goods.

C. Yes, because the security shut 
ters were nonconforming.

D. Yes, because Prevention did not
notify Lion that the 4' x 8' secu 
rity shutters were for accommo 
dation only.

59. Did Lion properly reject the security

shutters delivered on March 7?

A. No, because, under the VCC, a
contract for the sale of goods can
be modified without consider 
ation.

B. No, because Prevention cured
the February 10 defective ship 
ment by tender of conforming
goods on March 7.

C. Yes, because Prevention's ship 
ping of the 4' x 8' security shut 
ters on February constituted an 
ticipatory breach.

D. Yes, because Prevention's ship 
ping of the 4' x 8' security shut 
ters on February 10 constituted
a present breach.

m CONTRACTS

B. $6,000, because of an unantici 
pated change of circumstances.

C. Only in quantum merit, because
SecureCo did not intend to oper 
ate at a loss.

D. Only in quantum meruit, because
by demanding $6,000 SecureCo
repudiated its contract with Tom.

61. What argument best supports the claim
for the additional $1,000 by SecureCo
against BurgCo?

A. BurgCo had made an offer to
SecureCo that was accepted
when it submitted its bid.

B. BurgCo had made an offer that
SecureCo accepted by using the
former's bid in computing the
bid it submitted to Tom.

C. BurgCo's bid was an offer that it
was obligated to hold open be 
cause of the fact that BurgCo and
SecureCo were merchants.

D. An option contract was created
when SecureCo used BurgCo's
bid.

62. Tony, a third year law student at Wazoo
Law School, was the captain of the
Moot Court team. One evening Tony
and a few classmates were drinking beer
at Texas Lucky's, a favorite Wazoo Law
School hangout. They were worried that
the Moot Court team, known as the
Litigators, would be forced to disband
because the law school had withdrawn
its sponsorship. While Ann was discuss 
ing the problem with her teammates,
Peter, the owner of the bar, approached
the group. Peter indicated that he was
interested in sponsoring the Moot Court
because he felt it would bring in more
business from the law school. During
their discussion, Peter agreed to spon 
sor the Moot Court team. They then
entered into a written agreement, which
provided that Peter would pay for all
the "usual sponsoring fees."

Peter had understood the agreement to
mean that he would supply the keg of
beer following each competition. Con 
versely, Tony thought that Peter would
be reimbursing the team for 1) trans 
portation costs, 2) research and mate 
rial costs, 3) the keg of beer, and 4)
plaques to the competition finalists. Did
a contract exist between Tony and Pe 
ter?

A. No contract exists.

B. Yes, a contract exists on the
terms understood by Tony.

C. Yes, a contract exists on the
terms understood by Peter.

CONTRACTS iii

D. Yes, a contract exists but only on
the consistent terms between the
parties.

Questions 63 - 65 are based on the
following facts:

On September 1, Oliva Co., an olive whole 
saler, sent Mario, the owner of an Italian res 
taurant in Los Angeles, the following signed
letter:

"Have 300 pounds oflarge fresh olives avail 
able at $3.00 per pound for October deliv 
ery. This offer will remain open for accep 
tance until October 1. Please reply if inter 
ested."

On September 30, Mario wired the follow 
ing telegram to Oliva Co., which it received
the next day:

"Please be advised that I hereby accept your
offer dated September 1. However, I would
appreciate your delivering 150 pounds in
October and 150 pounds in November if you
possibly can."

63. According to the given facts, is it pos 
sible that Oliva Co., could have revoked
the offer before October 1?

A. No, because it had given Mario
assurance that the offer would be
held open until October 1.

B. No, because Oliva Co. and Mario

are merchants.

C. Yes, because there is no consid 
eration to support an option con 
tract.

&I CONTRACTS

D. Yes, unless Mario detrimentally

relied on the offer.

64. Mario's telegram of September 30 has

which of the following effects?

A. It has no legal effect because the
mode of acceptance was not by
the same means as the offer.

B.

It operates as a rejection of Oliva
Co.'s offer, and a proposal of a
counteroffer.

C. It creates a contract for 150
pounds of olives for October de-
livery and 150 pounds of olives
for November delivery.

D. It creates a contract for 300
pounds of olives for October de-
livery.

65. Assume for the purposes of this ques-
tion only, that Oliva Co. delivered 150
pounds of olives to Mario during Octo-
ber and 150 pounds of olives during
November. However, 100 pounds of
those delivered in November were not
of merchantable quality. If Mario ac-
cepts the olives knowing of their defec-
tive condition, he probably has:

A. A remedy against Oliva Co.,
whether or not he gives Oliva Co.
notice of the breach.

B. A remedy against Oliva Co., pro-
vided he gives Oliva Co. notice
of the breach.

C)
0

cn

C. No remedy against Oliva Co.
because he waives whatever
claim he may have by accepting
the defective olives.

D. No remedy against Oliva Co.
because the risk of loss falls on
Mario due to the perishable na-
ture of the product. 

CONTRACTS 79


Questions 66 - 67 are based on the
following facts:

On March 1, 1993, Tromp entered into a
written contract with Leon wherein the lat 
ter agreed to remodel the penthouse suite of
Tromp's hotel for $2 million. According to
the terms of the agreement, Tromp prom 
ised to pay Leon $1 million when work was
to commence on May 1, 1993, with the bal 
ance payable upon completion of the job.

On April 1, 1993, Leon sent Tromp a letter
stating that the cost of building materials had
increased from his original estimate. Con 
sequently, Leon indicated that he did not
think he could perform the remodeling work
unless Tromp agreed to increase the price to
$2.5 million. Without notifying Leon, Tromp
went ahead and hired Ivan to perform the
remodeling for the price of $2.2 million,
which was the fair market cost of the work
to be done.

Ivan started renovating the penthouse on
April 26, 1993. On May 1, 1993, Leon
showed up at Tromp's hotel. Leon told
Tromp he reconsidered and was ready to
begin remodeling the penthouse at the origi 
nal contract price. Tromp then informed him
that he had hired someone else and dismissed
Leon from the job.

66. Leon brings suit against Tromp for
breach of contract. Judgment will be
for?

Ell CONTRACTS

A. Leon, because Tromp did not in 
form him before May 1 that he
was hiring someone else to per 
form the remodeling work.

B. Leon, because he attempted to
perform the remodeling work as
contractually agreed.

C. Tromp, because he hired Ivan for
$300,000 less than Leon de 
manded in his April 1 letter.

D. Tromp, because Leon's April 1
letter manifested his prospective
inability to perform, thereby jus 
tifying Tromp treating such as an
anticipatory breach.

67. Assume for the purposes of this ques 
tion only, that Leon is liable for breach
of contract in the previous example. In
addition, assume that Ivan completed
the remodeling of the suite at a profit
of $300,000. Tromp went ahead and
paid Ivan the contract price of $2.2 mil 
lion, plus an additional $80,000 so Ivan
would not lose any money. In a breach
of contract action by Tromp against
Leon, Tromp should recover:

A. $200,000, or the difference be 
tween Leon's contract price and
Ivan's contract price.

B. $500,000, or the difference be 
tween Leon's original contract
price and the amount he de 
manded in his April 1 letter.

C. $1,000,000, or the difference
between Leon's original contract
price and the amount Tromp paid
Ivan.

D. $280,000, the difference between
Tromp's payment to Ivan and
Leon's original price.

68. Brown is the owner of Blackacres, a
twenty-acre horse ranch. On December
1, Brown and Green both signed an
agreement that stated, "In consideration
of $1,000, receipt of which is acknowl 
edged, Brown hereby offers to sell
Blackacres to Green, for $150,000. This
offer is to remain open for thirty days
upon the signing by each party. All
terms are incorporated."

The property had a fair market value of
$165,000. Green failed to pay Brown
the $1,000 consideration upon the sign 
ing of the agreement. On December 20,
Brown sent Green a letter stating:

"Have offer for the purchase of
Blackacres from White for $160,000. I
hereby withdraw my offer to you for
the sale of Blackacres for $150,000,
signed Brown."

The next day, Green tendered $151,000
cash to Brown for the purchase of
Blackacres (which included the $1,000
unpaid consideration money) and de 
manded the deed to Blackacres. Brown
refused. Green brings an action against
Brown for specific performance.

Brown seeks to introduce the fact that
Green never paid the $1,000 consider 
ation as required per their written and
signed agreement dated December 1.
Upon Green's objection, will the trial
court permit the testimony?

A. Yes, because the parole evidence
doctrine permits contradictory
facts in the parties' agreement.

B. Yes, because the parol evidence
rule does not operate to exclude
evidence of contemporaneous or
subsequent oral modifications of
the written term.

C. No, because the written instru 
ment is a complete integration of
the parties' agreement.

D. No, because the doctrine of
promissory estoppel will only
apply if Green relied on the
Brown-Green agreement to his
detriment.

69. Willy owned and operated the Willy's
Ice Cream and Sandwich Parlor. The
parlor was located at the busy intersec 
tion of the Pacific Coast Highway and
Dover. Because of its prime location,
Willy's was a popular stop for tourists
and vacationers. In 1982, Willy leased
the Parlor to Dick under a written
ten-year lease. During the sixth year of
the lease, the city reconstructed the
Highway. The city expanded an exist 
ing bridge in order to correct the traffic
congestion problem. Because of the re 
construction, the highway now went
over the parlor. This caused a substan 
tial decline in Dick's business.

Neither party had knowledge of the
city's intent to change that intersection
at the time they entered into the lease
agreement. Dick contacted Willy and
told him of the circumstances. Dick
asked Willy to renegotiate the lease
agreement, but Willy refused. Because
of the decline in the parlor's business,
Dick was losing money. He decided to
abandon the parlor and refuses to pay
Willy any rent. Willy brings an action
against Dick to recover the unpaid rent.
Who will prevail?

A. Dick, because of the doctrine of
impossibility of performance.

B. Dick, because the parties in 
ferred, within their agreement,
the continued existence of the
heavily traveled highway.

m CONTRACTS

C. Willy, because Dick assumed the
risk of any change in circum 
stances when he entered into the
lease.

D. Willy, because both parties were
wrong in their judgment con 
cerning the road change.

70. Tony engaged Dawn, an inexperienced
actress, to do a small role in a new
Broadway play for a period of six
months at a salary of $ 1,000 a week.
Dawn turned down another role in a
Broadway play, in order to accept this
engagement. On the third day of the run,
Dawn was hospitalized with bulimia
and Betty was hired to do the part. A
week later, Dawn recovered, but Tony
refuses to accept her services for the
remainder of the run. Dawn brings a
breach of contract action against Tony.
Which of the following is Dawn's best
legal theory?

A. Her acting contract with Tony
was legally severable into
weekly units.

B. Her performance of the literal
terms of the contract was physi 
cally impossible.

C. She had relied on the engage 
ment with Tony, as shown by
declining another acting role.

D. Her failure to perform for one
week was not a material failure.

Questions 71 â€” 72 are based on the
following facts:

On March 5, Seller orally agreed to sell his
land, Parcel, to Buyer for $135,000, to be
paid on March 31. Buyer orally agreed to
pay $35,000 of the purchase price to Credi-
tor in satisfaction of a debt which seller owed
to Creditor.

On March 12, Buyer had his attorney, Law-
yer, put the agreement into a writing. Law-
yer omitted all the terms in reference to the
$35,000 payment to Creditor. Lawyer's sec-
retary mistakenly typed $134,000 as the pur-
chase price, rather than $135,000, while pre-
paring the agreement. Neither Seller nor
Buyer read the contract carefully before
signing it on March 20, and neither Seller
nor Buyer noticed the error in the price.
Neither Buyer nor Seller raised any ques-
tion concerning omission of the payment to
Creditor.

71. In an action by Creditor against Buyer
for $35,000, which of the following is
(are) correct?

I. Buyer could successfully
raise the Statute of
Frauds as a defense be-
cause the Buyer-Seller
agreement was to answer
for the debt of another.

II. Buyer could successfully

agreement was for the
sale of an interest in land.  

A. I only.

B. II only.

C. I and II.

D. Neither I nor II. 

72. If Buyer refused to pay more than
$134,000 for Parcel, in an action by
Seller against Buyer for the additional
$1,000, it would be to Seller's advan-
tage to try to prove that:

A. The writing was intended only as

a sham.

B. The writing was only a partial

integration.

C. There was a mistake in integra-

tion.

D. There was a misunderstanding
between Seller and Buyer con-
cerning the purchase price.

Questions 76 - 77 are based on the
following facts:

Fannland is a three-acre dairy farm with a
small residence upon it. Oliver, the owner
of Fannland, entered into a written lease with
Terry for the rental of Farmland on a month 
to-month basis, at a rate of $1 ,600 per month.
After Terry had been in possession for sev 
eral years, Terry and Oliver orally agreed that
Terry would purchase Farmland for $48,000
payable at a monthly rate of $1,600 (which
included principal and interest) for 30 years.

Further, it was agreed that Terry would pay
all future property taxes and the expenses
for insuring Farmland against fire loss.
Oliver agreed that after receiving $24,000
in payments, Oliver would tender the deed
to Farmland to Terry, and Terry in exchange,
would execute a note secured by a deed of
trust for the balance of the unpaid purchase
price.

Terry, now being a homeowner, made over
$2,000 in improvements on the property.
When Terry had tendered $24,000 to Oliver,
Oliver, although not denying the oral agree 
ment, refused to tender the deed to Farm 
land. Terry brought an action against Oliver
for specific performance.

76. If Oliver prevails, it is because:

A. Nothing Terry would have done
would have overcome the agree 
ment not being in writing.

B. The actions and payment of
Terry are consistent with her be 
ing a tenant.

C. Oliver has not received any un 
conscionable benefit, and there 
fore Terry is not entitled to equi 
table relief.

D. The Statute of Frauds controls.

77. If Terry prevails, it will be because of:

A. The improvements show that
Terry detrimentally relied on the
oral agreement.

B. The $24,000 received by Oliver
as payment towards the purchase
price.

C. Oliver would receive an unjust
benefit if the contract is not en 
forced.

D. The contract entered into be 
tween Terry and Oliver was sup 
ported by consideration.

78. Coiner, a retail coin dealer, purchased
a 1916 dime from Investor for $500.
The "D" stamped on the coin indicated
it had originated at the Denver mint,
making it a rare issue. Coiner's owner,
Barry, examined the coin before the pur 
chase. Coiner, resold the rare coin to
Denny, for $750. Denny later found out
that the coin was a counterfeit. Denny
sued to rescind its purchase of the 1916
dime from Coiner. The court will:

CONTRACTS Ell

A. Allow rescission of the contract
because of a misrepresentation.

Questions 79 - 80 are based on the
following facts:

B. Allow rescission of the contract
because there was mutual mis 
take.

C. Not allow the contract to be re 
scinded because there was no
warranty made.

D. Not allow rescission of the con

Ray Rogers Jr. purchased an automobile
from a car dealer, Auto, on August 15, 1992.
On that date, Rogers was 17 years old and
would be 18 on September 25, 1992. Ray
executed a purchase money security agree 
ment to finance $4,724, the balance due on
the purchase price of the automobile, pay 
able in thirty installments of $198.10 each.
Auto subsequently assigned the purchase
money agreement to Union Fed Bank.

After making 11 monthly payments, Rogers
voluntarily returned the automobile to Auto,
and defaulted on his payment obligations.
Upon default, Union Fed Bank reassigned
the purchase money security agreement to
Auto. Auto sold the automobile at public
auction for $1,400, leaving a deficiency of
over $4,510.

79. Auto now brings suit against Rogers to
recover the deficiency. Judgment will
be for:

A. Auto, because Rogers affirmed

the contract.

B. Auto, because a minor cannot
disaffirm a contract after reach 
ing the age of majority.

C. Rogers, because contracts en 
tered into by minors are void 
able.

Ell CONTRACTS

D. Rogers, because by returning the
car to Auto, Rogers properly
disaffirmed the contract.

81.

80. Assume in this question, that Rogers
disaffirmed the contract on September
24, 1992, without making any pay 
ments, and failed to return the automo 
bile. After nine months of investigation,
Auto finds the car parked in an aban 
doned lot. Auto takes possession of the
car and sells the car at a public action
for $1,200, leaving a deficiency. Auto
brings suit against Rogers for the
amount of the deficiency. Auto will:

A. Prevail, because Rogers did not

return the automobile.

B. Prevail, because the automobile
was not returned and was found
nine months later.

C. Prevail, because the automobile
was not found until after Rogers
reached the age of majority.

D. Not prevail, because a contract

by an infant is voidable.

In June 1992, Mrs. Fletcher was trans 
ferred by her employer from Denver,
Colorado to Lompoc, California. In
looking for a house for her family, she
consulted a local real estate agency. Mr.
Caldwell of that agency showed Mrs.
Fletcher several homes, including Mr.
Tibbs' home. Mr. Tibbs' property was
located a short distance from where
Mrs. Fletcher's new office was located.
The home obtained its water supply
from a well located on the property. Mr.
Tibbs received information indicating
that the well was contaminated after
Mrs. Fletcher had looked at the house.
Mrs. Fletcher had Mr. Caldwell write
up an offer for Mr. Tibbs' property. Mr.
Tibbs accepted the offer, and did not
disclose the information about the con 
taminated well. After escrow closed,
Mrs. Fletcher moved into the property
and discovered that the well was con 
taminated. Mrs. Fletcher now brings
suit to rescind the contract. The court
will find for:

A. Mr. Tibbs, because there was no
duty to disclose newly- discov 
ered information.

B. Mr. Tibbs, because escrow
closed, releasing him from any
further obligations.

C. Mrs. Fletcher, because Mr. Tibbs
failed to disclose the contami

82. Kemper submitted a bid to City to do
piping work for a sewer project. The
City requires that ten percent of the bid
price be posted as a bond, in favor of
the City, guaranteeing that the bidder
would do the job for the bid price if
awarded the contract. Kemper gave a
bid at $780,305. Three competing bids
were $1,049,592, $1,183,000, and
$1,278,895. Kemper discovered a few
hours later, after the bids were opened,
that there was a $301,769 error in his
computations, in which he relied upon
in making the bid. Kemper explained
the error to City and withdrew his bid,
but City accepted the bid anyway.

Kemper refuses to enter into a contract
with City at the mistaken bid price.
Kemper sued to rescind the bid. Kemper
will:

A. Prevail, because Kemper made

a material mistake.

B. Prevail, because City would be
unjustly enriched if Kemper has
to perform.

Questions 83 - 85 are based on the
following facts:

Bob purchased 100 bolts oflightweight wool
fabric of No.1 quality from Dan. Their con 
tract required Bob to pay for the fabric prior
to inspection. The 100 bolts were shipped,
and Bob made payment to Dan. Upon his
inspection, Bob discovered that the wool was
No.2 quality. Bob tendered back the wool
to Dan, and demanded return of his payment.
Dan refused on the ground that there is no
difference between No.1 quality wool and
No.2 quality wool.

83. Which of the following statements re 
garding the contract provision for
pre-inspection payment is correct?

A.

It constitutes an acceptance of
the goods.

B.

It constitutes a waiver of the
buyer's remedy of private sale in
the case of nonconforming
goods.

C.

It does not impair a buyer's right
of inspection or his remedies.

C. Not prevail, because City relied

on the bid.

D. It is invalid.

D. Not prevail, because once a bid
is submitted, it cannot be with 
drawn.

84. What is Bob's remedy because the wool

was nonconforming?

A. Specific performance.

mCONTRACTS

B. Damages measured by the differ 
ence between the value of the
goods delivered and the value of
conforming goods.

C. Damages measured by the price
paid, plus the difference between
the contract price and the cost of
buying substitute goods.

D. None, since he waived his rem 
edies by agreeing to pay before
inspection.

85. Can Bob resell the wool?

A. Yes, in a private sale.

B. Yes, in a private sale- but only
after giving Dan reasonable no 
tice of his intention to resell.

C. Yes, but only at a public sale.

D. No, because such an act is incon 
sistent with the claim such goods
were nonconforming.

Questions 86 - 87 are based on the
following facts:

Nancy and Melissa, both legal secretaries for
the Shiester & Shiester law film, enrolled in
the firm's voluntary computer program. This
program opted for each to purchase a com 
puter, for daily training during their lunch
hours. Nancy bought an inexpensive system.
Melissa spent $4,000 for the best system
available. After three months, Nancy discov 
ered that she enjoyed working on her com 
puter so much that she would even come in
to work on weekends. Melissa really wasn't
enthusiastic; in fact, Melissa only worked
on her computer about once a week. When
Melissa learned of how much Nancy enjoyed
working on the computer, she wrote Nancy
a memo offering to sell her computer. The
memo stated, "I am not a computer buff; if
you will pick up the computer at my office
before or after work, I will sell it to you for
$1,000. I will not revoke this offer."

Nancy knew a deal when she heard one, and
sent a letter to Melissa on Tuesday stating,
"I accept your offer and will pick up the com 
puter on friday at 7:00 a.m."

The next day, Melissa learns in her employee
evaluation conference, that if she becomes
competent on the computer, she will receive
a large salary increase.

Nancy comes to Melissa's office at 7:00 a.m.
on friday. Melissa refuses to sell Nancy the
computer.

CONTRACTS ED

86. Nancy brings an action for breach of
contract against Melissa. What is the
legal effect of Nancy's letter accepting
Melissa's offer to sell the computer?

A. It is an ineffective attempt by
Nancy to accept Melissa's offer.

B. A unilateral contract was created,
when Nancy mailed the letter.

C.

It constituted notice to Melissa
that Nancy would buy the com 
puter.

D. A bilateral contract was created
when Melissa received the letter.

87. What is the effect of Melissa's promise

not to revoke the offer?

A. It prevents Melissa from revok 

ing the offer.

B.

It has no effect because Melissa
did not state a date for termina 
tion.

C.

It has no effect.

D. It prevents any implied revoca 

tion.

III CONTRACTS

Questions 88 - 90 are based on the
following facts:

On April 1, Tim offered to sell his prize mare,
Midnight, to Marty for $10,000. Marty
handed Tim a $100 bill. In return, Tim
handed Marty a written statement which in 
cluded the offer and also included, that Tim
promised not to revoke the offer for a 60 
day period. Tim signed the offer. Both Tim
and Marty are in the horse breeding busi 
ness.

On April 5, 1993, Marty wrote a letter to
Tim which stated, "I cannot afford to pay
more than $8,000 for the mare. If you can 
not accept the $8,000, I cannot purchase the
horse."

Tim had already sold Midnight to Melinda
on April 4, 1993. Marty was unaware of the
sale.

On April 15, 1993, Marty discovered he
would receive a tax refund. He immediately
wrote to Tim. His letter stated, "I accept your
offer to purchase Midnight, your prize mare,
for $10,000."

88.

IfMarty sues Tim for damages, the most
likely outcome will be:

A. A contract was formed because
Tim was precluded from selling
Midnight to another party.

B. A contract was formed because
acceptance any time during the
60 days was effective.

C. Marty's letter of April 5, 1993,
prevented a contract from being
formed.

D. There was no formation of a con 
tract because Tim's prior sale of
Midnight to a third party, re 
voked his original offer.

89. Assume that Tim did not sell Midnight
to another party until April 10, 1993,
after receiving Marty's letter of April
5, 1993, and that Marty learned of the
sale on April 14, 1993. Marty's power
to accept the offer would be:

A. Good for 60 days, because Marty
paid $100 for a 60-day option.

B. Terminated on April 14, 1993.

C. Terminated, when Tim received
Marty's April 5, 1993 letter.

D. Terminated, when Tim sold Mid 

night.

90. What if Marty's letter dated April 5,
1993, contained a check for $10,000
and stated "I am going on vacation and
will pick the mare up in 30 days. I will
pay for any board and necessary care."
The letter is:

A. A counter-offer because it
changes the terms of the origi 
naloffer.

B. A counter-offer because it was

not definite.

C. An acceptance, and Tim must

board the mare.

D. An acceptance, and Tim may

refuse to board the mare.

91. Matt began working for Morrocam
Food Supply Company in 1969. Matt
agreed to work at a pay rate below union
scale, in exchange for a promise that
Morrocam would employ him "for
life." In 1987, Sansabar took over man 
agement of Morrocam Food Supply
Company. Sansabar assured Morrocam
employees that existing employment
contracts would be honored. Matt went
to a Sansabar supervisor and explained
the terms of his employment agreement.
The supervisor stated that he would
look into the matter, but never got back
to Matt. After 18 years of service, Matt
was fired by the new owners of the busi 
ness. Matt brings suit for breach of a
contract. Matt will most likely:

A. Win, because if the requirement
of consideration is met, there is
no additional requirement for
enforcing the contract.

B. Win, because Matt agreed to
work below scale in exchange
for lifetime employment.

C. Lose, because traditional law did
not uphold unilateral contracts.

D. Lose, because you cannot prom 
ise to employ someone for life.

92. Gil Glass Merchant and Wally Glass
Wholesalers had been doing business
with each other for 30 years. As was
his custom, Gil phoned Wally and
placed an order of 1200 glasses to be
delivered in sets of 100, one set each
month. The glasses were $5 each. Af 
ter Wally delivered the first set, Gil sent
Wally a check for $500 and a letter stat 
ing, "$5 a glass is too high; cancel the
remainder of my order, Wally." Wally
sues Gil for breach of contract. Gil
pleads the Statute of Frauds as a de 
fense. The most likely outcome will be
that:

A. Wally prevails, because 100
glasses have been received by
Gil.

B. Wally prevails, because the note
constituted a writing sufficient to
satisfy the Statute of Frauds.

Questions 93 - 94 are based on the
following facts:

Con, a general contractor, was commis 
sioned to build a new motel. Con took bids
from several sub-contractors for the plumb 
ing. John submitted a bid for $80,000. The
next lowest bid was $85,000. The remain 
ing bids ranged between $86,000 to $87,
500. Con gave the contract to John on March
1,1993. Work was to begin on April 1, 1993.
One week before John was to begin work 
ing, he discovered that he had made an error
in his calculations. John immediately called
Con and told him that he had made a mis 
take and the bid should have been $84,000,
instead of $80,000. John refuses to work,
unless Con agrees to pay $84,000.

93. Con refuses to pay the additional
amount to John and brings suit for
breach of contract. The court will most
likely rule for:

C. Gil prevails, because he repudi 
ated the remaining contract.

A. Con, because John is bound by a

valid contract.

D. Gil prevails, because the note
does not satisfy the Statute of
Frauds.

B. Con, but only if he neither knew
nor could have known of the
mistake in calculations of the bid.

C. John, because his obligation is

discharged.

D. John, because time of perfor 

mance was not due.

ED CONTRACTS

94. Assume Con, being in a hurry to get
the work started, stated to John he
would pay the additional amount. Af 
ter John completes performance, Con
gives John a check for $80,000 and re 
fuses to pay the additional $4,000. The
most likely result will be:

A. John will not prevail because of
the obligation to perform the
work for $80,000.

B. John will not prevail, unless Con
never intended to pay the addi 
tional $4,000.

C. John will prevail because he in 
tended to work only for the
amount of $84,000.

D. John will prevail because the
parties mutually agreed to the
second contract.

95. Sterling, a merchant, deals in rare coins.
Sterling took out an insurance policy
from "Gouge Em" Insurance Company,
covering the coins Sterling had in stock
in his coin shop. There was a written
provision in the policy which stated all
records describing the coins were to be
kept off the store premises in a place
where they would not be stolen.

Sterling was updating his records, since
he had received new inventory. He de 
cided to finish the records the next day.
He went home and left the records in
the coin shop. The shop was robbed that
night. All the coins and the records of
the coins were stolen. "Gouge Em" re 
fuses to pay on the policy. Sterling
brings suit to recover on the policy. He
will most likely:

A. Not prevail, because Sterling
breached the contract by leaving
the records in the coin shop.

B. Not prevail, because the policy
specifically stated the records
must be stored in a safe place.

C. Prevail, because the provision in
the policy regarding the records
has been reasonably satisfied.

D. Prevail, because of the unfairness

of the provision.

CONTRACTS m

D. Yes, because Jim's act of mail 
ing the signed contract was an
effective acceptance.

97. Assume that during the April 3, 1993
telephone conversation, Rod stated,
"I'm glad you aren't going to buy my
Model T Ford, I really don't want to
part with it; I cancel my offer." Does
Jim have an enforceable contract to
purchase the Model T Ford from Rod?

A. No, because Jim stated his intent
to rescind any contract, and Rod
accepted the offer to rescind.

B. No, because there was no mani 
festation of contractual intent.

C. Yes, because you cannot rescind

a contract.

D. Yes, because no valid consider 
ation for rescission occurred.

Questions 96 - 97 are based on the
following facts:

Rod and Jim have been friends for many
years. Both collect antique cars. Rod had
acquired a Model T Ford that Jim felt was
the most exquisite Model T he had ever seen.
Jim, on several occasions, asked Rod if he
could purchase it. Rod did not want to part
with the car. Jim then stated, "If you ever
decide to sell the car, I want to buy it." On
April 1, 1993, Rod realized he was short on
cash and would not be able to pay his taxes.
He drafted a contract for the sale of his
Model T Ford to Jim. He mailed the con 
tract to Jim the same day. Jim received the
contract on April 3, 1993. He was so excited
that he signed it, and mailed it back the same
day. Later that day, Jim's accountant in 
formed him that he was broke. Jim immedi 
ately called Rod and told him to ignore the
signed contract when he received it, because
he was no longer in the financial position to
purchase the car. Rod received the signed
contract in the mail on April 5, 1993.

96. Can Rod enforce the contract for the
sale of his Model T Ford to Jim?

A. No, because Jim communicated
his retraction before Rod re 
ceived the signed contract in the
mail.

B. No, because the mail is not a re 
liable source of communication.

C. Yes, because Jim made his re 
traction by phone instead of by
mail.

ED CONTRACTS

Questions 98 - 100 are based on
the following facts:

Homeowner wanted to have the exterior of
his home repainted. He got out the yellow
pages, and called a number of established
painting firms. He received bids ranging
from $6,000 to $7,500. While trying to de 
cide on whom to use, Homeowner received
a call from Renoir, who submitted a bid to
do the work for $5,500. Homeowner entered
into a contract with Renoir to have the exte 
rior of his home painted. The work was to
begin on January 1, 1993. On December 30,
1992, Renoir called Homeowner and stated,
"My foreman made a mistake in adding the
figures. I can't possibly do the work for less
than $6,100, or I will lose money."

98. If Homeowner sues Renoir for breach

of contract, who prevails?

A. Renoir, because he had not

started painting.

B. Renoir, because of the defense of

mistake.

C. Homeowner, unless he can still
accept the bid of the next lowest
bidder.

D. Homeowner, only if he had no
reason to know of Renoir's er-
ror.

99. Assume that Homeowner responded to
Renoir's statement of an error in his bid
by stating, "I'll pay the extra money,
but I really think it's unfair." After
Renoir finished painting Homeowner's
home, Homeowner tenders a check for
$5,500 to Renoir. If Renoir brings suit
for the additional $600, the court will
most likely rule for:

A. Homeowner, because he did not
put his promise to pay the extra
$600 in a valid writing.

B. Homeowner, because Renoir
was under a pre-existing duty to
paint the house for $5,500.

C. Renoir, because he detrimentally
relied on Homeowner's promise
to pay the additional $600.

D. Renoir, because public policy
enforcing

would mandate
Renoir's promise to pay.

100. Assume that Homeowner responded to
Renoir's statement of an error in his
bid by stating, "I'll pay the extra
money if you also paint the inside of
my garage and all the plant boxes in
the back yard." Renoir agrees. After
Renoir completes the painting of the
exterior of the home, the garage and
the plant boxes, Homeowner tenders
a check for $5,500, refusing to pay the
additional $600. If Renoir brings suit
for the additional $600, who will pre 
vail?

CONTRACTS III

A. Homeowner, because Renoir
was under a pre-existing duty to
paint the house for $5,500.

D. Lose, because contractor could
demand "assurance of perfor 
mance."

B. Homeowner, because the prom 

ise was not in writing.

e. Renoir, because there was a valid
modification of the contract.

D. Renoir, because he detrimentally
relied on Homeowner's promise.

101. Sub-contractor agrees to install the
plumbing in a motel being contracted
by Contractor. Three days before Sub 
contractor is to begin work, contrac 
tor learns that Sub-contractor's em 
ployees went on strike. Contractor de 
mands Sub-contractor to explain how
he will perform the plumbing work.
When Sub-contractor does not explain,
contractor withholds an advance pay 
ment due to Sub-contractor, under the
terms of the contract, and hires a dif 
ferent sub-contractor to perform the
plumbing work. Sub-contractor sues
contractor for breach of contract. Sub 
contractor will most likely:

A. Prevail, because the u.e.e. does

not apply to services.

B. Prevail, because he intended to

do the work himself.

C. Lose, because another sub-con 

tractor finished the work.

Questions 107 -109 are based on
the following facts:

In 1980, Isac took out a life insurance policy
for $100,000. The policy stated that the in 
sured had power to change the beneficiary
and to assign the policy. In 1990, Isac named
his wife as the beneficiary. Wife did not
know of the insurance policy. In 1991, Isac
changed the beneficiary from his wife to his
only daughter, from another marriage. Isac
wrote the daughter and informed her of the
policy. In 1992, Isac borrowed $10,000 and
assigned the policy to an assignee as secu 
rity. Isac died in 1993.

107. Wife learns of the insurance policy and
sues insurance company to collect the
proceeds. Wife will:

A. Not prevail, because she was not

the intended beneficiary.

B. Not prevail, because she was not

the incidental beneficiary.

C. Prevail, because public policy
would warrant a wife being pro 
vided for.

D. Prevail, because Wife is a donee

beneficiary.

108. Daughter sues Insurance Company to

collect the proceeds. Daughter will:

A. Not prevail, because the wife
will be entitled to the insurance
proceeds.

B. Not prevail, because Isac bor 

rowed against the policy.

C. Prevail, because she is his only

daughter.

D. Prevail, as the donee beneficiary.

109. Assignee sues the insured for the
$10,000 that Isac borrowed. Daughter
intervenes. The court will most likely
hold for:

A. Daughter, because she is the
named beneficiary and thus pre 
vails over any assignee.

B. Daughter, because she is a donee
beneficiary; thus, a promisee can
not assign any part of the
beneficiary's right, once they
know of the contract.

C. Assignee, because Isac reserved
the right to change the benefi 
ciary and to assign the policy.

D. Assignee, because there was

the following facts:

Cathy and Tim operate a foreign car dealer 
ship under the name of Cat Imports. In Janu 
ary 1993, Jag orally agreed to supply Jaguar
automobiles at 15% below factory cost. Jag
immediately sent a written confirmation. Cat
Imports never received the written confir 
mation from Jag. In February 1993, Cathy
and Tim had several major disagreements.
Tim decided to terminate the business rela 
tionship. He executed a document assign 
ing all of his rights in Cat's Imports to Cathy.
Cathy, in return, agreed to be solely liable
for all of Cat's business obligations. Jag
knew of the assignment.

In May 1993, Jag sent Cat Imports an in 
voice showing a balance owing of $90,000.
Cathy sent Jag a check for $76,500, marked
"payment in full". Cathy also enclosed a let 
ter stating that Jag had not deducted the 15%
discount. Jag sent a letter demanding the
additional $13,500, but deposited the
$76,500 check into their account. Jag also
stated that the 15% agreement was invalid
because Tim had left the business.

112. Jag brings suit against Cat Imports for
$13,500, asserting the statute of frauds
as a defense. Jag will most likely:

A. Prevail, because Cat never re 
ceived the written confirmation
from Jag.

B. Prevail, because the sale of
goods in excess of $500 must be
evidenced by a sufficient writing.

C. Not prevail, because of the Pa 

rol Evidence Rule.

D. Not prevail, because Cat's pro 
test letter is a sufficient writing.

113. Assume that Jag brings a suit for
$13,500. Cat's best argument would
be:

A. Accord and Satisfaction.

B. Promissory Estoppel.

C. Novation.

D. Implied Novation.

114. Assume Jag sues Tim for the contract
amount still owing. Tim's best argu 
ment would be:

A. There was a valid accord and

satisfaction.

B. The Statute of Frauds was vio 

lated.

C. There was an implied novation.

D. None of the above.

115. Assume for this question, that Cat Im 
ports has orders for 10 cars at the dis 
counted price, and the court finds that
a valid contract exists, requiring Jag
to supply the cars at a 15% discount.
What are Cats' remedies:

tract with Bugsy to play piano at his new
night club for one year. Chopin was to re-
ceive $4,000 per month, beginning January
1. Bugsy's club was to open New Year's Eve.
Chopin is very popular, and Bugsy knows
he will pack the club with Chopin as the
headliner.

136. On December 29, Chopin calls Bugsy
and states he may not be ready to start
until January 10. Will the court allow
Bugsy to bring an immediate suit
against Chopin?

A. No, because a repudiation must

be in writing.

B. No, because there was no repu-

diation.

C. Yes, because there was a repu-

diation.

D. Yes, because Bugsy will lose
money and is entitled to dam-
ages.

137. Assume that after the December 26
agreement, no communication be-
tween the parties occurred. On Janu-
ary 1, Bugsy receives a telegram from
Chopin, stating that he will not start
until January 10. May Bugsy cancel
the existing contract?

A. No, because Chopin notified

Bugsy.

B. No, unless there was a material

breach.

C. Yes, because Bugsy will lose
money he has counted on.

D. Yes, because there was a mate-

rial breach. 

138. Assume that Chopin does not appear
for the month of January to play at
Bugsy's club because he was playing
at the Waldorf for $6,000. Bugsy, un-
aware of why Chopin is not at his ap-
pearance, hires Solaire at $5,000 per
month for 12 months. Bugsy files suit
against Chopin. What is the most likely
amount he will recover?

A. $1,000 damages.

B. $1,000 damages for the month of
January, and present value of the
$1,000 per month salary differ-
ence, for the remaining 11
months.

C. Nothing.

D. The full contract price of the

Bugsy - Chopin contract.

139. Builder entered into a contract with
Homeowner to build a pool
in
Homeowner's backyard for $10,000.
The price is to include all building ma 
terials. The week before performance
was to begin, Homeowner called
Builder and said, "I've changed my
mind, the deal is off." Builder brings a
cause of action against Homeowner for
breach of contract. Homeowner raises
the statute of frauds as a defense. What
will the court most likely rule?

140. On November 1, Cam and Ken agreed,
in writing, that Cam would purchase
Ken's 1990 BMW for $25,000. The
sale was to take place November 15.
On November 10, Cam tells Ken, "I
really can't afford the car, the deal is
off." Ken says, "Okay Cam, I'll let you
out of the deal." The next day, Ken tells
Cam he decided not to let him out of
the deal, because he needs the money.
If Ken sues Cam for breach of con 
tract, will he recover?

I.

If the building materials
were to exceed $500, the
contract is required to be
in writing.

II. The building of a pool is
a service, thus no writing
is required.

A.

I only.

B.

II only.

C.

D. Neither I nor II.

A. Yes, because contracts cannot be

rescinded orally.

B. Yes, because on November

there was a contract.

C. No, because Cam does not have

141. Cal has spent $100,000 in expenses
and wants to recover his expenditures.
His best theory of recovery will be
based on:

A. Quasi-contract.

B.

Impossibility of perfonnance.

C. Material breach.

D. None of the above.

142. What may Cal contractor recover?

A. No amount, because he is in ma

B. No amount, because he did not
complete perfonnance as prom 
ised.

C. Through restitution, he may re 
cover the $100,000 benefit con

146. Tom purchases a restaurant, secured by
purchase money financing. The restau 
rant needs a new air conditioning sys 
tem. Tom, short of cash, purchases the
air conditioning system from Earl's Air
Systems, on credit. Earl's takes a se 
curity interest in the equipment sold
to Tom and timely files a security in 
terest under Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code.

Tom fails to pay for the equipment and
goes bankrupt. Earl's claims a priority
interest in the system over Tom's other
creditors. The bankruptcy trustee
claims an interest in the system for the
benefit of all creditors. Whose interest
in the system has priority?

A. All the general creditors, because
they are owed money from Tom
for supplies sold to Tom on credit
for the restaurant.

B. Earl's, because any supplier of
fixtures sold on credit has a se 
cured interest in the fixture until
paid for.

C. Earl's, because of Earl's per 
fected security interest in the
equipment.

D. Neither Earl nor the creditors,

147. Sam's Sugar Company ("Sam") sells
Bob's Export Foods ("Bob") five thou

placed the order on his own order form
by filling in the description and quan 
tity of the goods. In the space for price,
Bob wrote: "FOB PLANT PER 100
POUND BAG $15.25."

Because the sugar was being shipped
overseas, Sam agreed to load up Bob's
shipping container with the sugar. The
loaded container was stolen from
Sam's plant before Bob's carrier was
able to pick it up. Sam sues Bob for
the contract price when Bob refuses to
pay. Who prevails?

A. Sam, since he had already loaded
up the shipping container for
overseas transport.

B. Sam, because the parties had
"agreed otherwise" to pass the
risk of loss at the time and place
the shipping container was
loaded.

C. Bob, because the risk of loss can 
not pass when identified goods
have been stolen - although nei 
ther party is at fault.

D. Bob, because the term "FOB
PLANT" requires delivery to the
carrier before the risk of loss
passes.

148. John collects antique cars as an invest 
ment. In 1992, John purchased a home
and assumes the existing mortgage
with Bank. Excited about his new
home, John purchases lumber on credit
from Hardware Store to build a larger
garage for his car collection.
Hardware's credit application states
that it has a secured interest in the lum 
ber until the goods are paid for.

After completing his new garage, John
defaults on his debts to Hardware and
Bank. Which party's claimed interest
in the lumber prevails?

A. Bank, if its secured interest in the

realty is first in time.

B. Bank, since the lumber was or 
dinary building materials.

C. Hardware, if it filed its security
interest in the lumber prior to
construction of the garage.

D. Hardware, because the lumber
became a fixture upon incorpo 
ration into the construction of the
garage.

A. FRU, because it filed its security
interest within the 21-day grace
period.

B. FRU, because a fixture financier
is entitled to a security interest

choice for that "bronzed look."
Hamilton George invested all his
money to open up a tanning salon sup 
ply store, to profit from the surge in
salon business.

George sold his tanning equipment on
credit, which he also installed for his

to the realty of his customers' busi 
nesses.

Questions 149 -150 are based on
the following facts:

Matt's Motel ("Matt") purchases a new fur 
nace on credit from Furnace R Us ("FRU")
which FRU installs the same day. There is a
preexisting mortgage on the motel through
Intrastate Bank ("Intrastate"). FRU files its
security interest in the furnace three weeks
after the sale to Matt. Matt then takes out a
second mortgage with Continental Bank
("Continental"). Matt defaults on all his
debts before they are repaid.

149. Whose interest in the furnace has pri 
ority between FRU and Continental?

A. FRU, because FRU's security
interest was filed before Conti 
nental recorded its mortgage.

B. FRU, because its security inter 
est was filed within the 21-day
grace period after installation of
the fixture.

C. Continental, since FRU did not
file its security interest within the
grace period, in order to have
priority over a subsequent inter 
est.

D. Continental, because the furnace
became realty which is subject
to a mortgagee's claim.

150. Whose security interest prevails be 

tween FRU and Intrastate?

discovering his error. Is the filing ef 
fective?

A. No, an erroneous filing is never

B. No, because unfamiliarity is no
excuse for George's mistake.

C. No, except as to the extent the

Questions 152 - 153 are based on

Chuck's Corvette Cafe was constructed on
a corner of Pacific Coast Highway,
in
Malibu. His indoor cafe was known for its
authentic Corvette-replica "booths", where
customers ordered and were served much
like the drive-up restaurants ofthe 60's. The
booths, were purchased from Bob's Booths
and were affixed to the restaurant building.
Bob properly files his security interest in the
booths.

Rock slides along the highway are a con 
stant problem for customers attempting to
reach the cafe and the cafe closes for lack of
business. Unable to pay his bills, Chuck de 
faults on his debt to Bob. Bob immediately
takes back the booths. Because the cafe
doors were too small to permit removal of
the booths, Bob smashes a large window to
extract the booths.

152. Were Bob's actions proper in repos 

sessing the booths?

A. Yes, he had timely obtained a
secured interest in the fixtures
prior to repossession.

B. Yes, because Bob had the right
to repossession without resort to
the judicial process.

C. No, because Bob breached the
peace in order to repossess the
booths.

Pam had Sam examined the next day
by a veterinarian, but no disease or de-
fect was discovered. However, 3 weeks

An autopsy of the toucan could not
identify the cause of death. Pam asks
Tina to replace her bird, but Tina re-
fuses. Pam sues Tina to recover her
purchase price. What is the most likely
result?

A. Tina loses, because she failed to
disclaim the implied warranty of
merchantability.

B. Tina loses, because the 72 hours
is not sufficient time to discover
defects or disease in a bird.

C. Pam loses, because she could not
prove Sam's cause of death.

D. Pam loses, because the implied
warranties of merchantability
and fitness for intended use were
expressly disclaimed.

3. D is the best answer. Tammy encoun 
tered no legal detriment; thus, she
would not prevail on this theory. A could
be an applicable theory for Tammy as
modern law holds that if a donative
promise induces reliance by the prom 
isee in a manner that the promisor
should reasonably have expected, the
promise will be legally enforceable. B,
although a good choice (the traditional
rule holds that a promise based on moral
obligation is unenforceable), is not the
best answer because the rule is pres 
ently, in a growing minority of juris 
dictions, modified. C is incorrect be 
cause in some circumstances the courts
have enforced a gratuitous promise that
foreseeably induced reliance.

4. A is the best answer. The general rule
is that a donative promise is unenforce 
able because there is a lack of consid 
eration. B is a correct statement, unless
the promise becomes enforceable and
is therefore, not the best answer. C is
an incorrect statement because there
was no bargained for exchange. D is an
incorrect statement of the law.

CONTRACTSANSWERS

1. D is the correct answer. A written letter
of confirmation, sent by a merchant
within a reasonable time after the oral
contract is made, will satisfy the statue
of frauds, if the receiving party is a
merchant and does not object to the
contents thereof within 10 days afterre 
ceipt. A is an incorrect statement be 
cause the parol evidence rule is only
applicable to alleged conditions of a
contract not included in the written con 
tract, itself. Such is not the situation
here. B is incorrect because the mer 
chant's exception, as discussed in D,
would make the statute of frauds inap 
plicable. C is an incorrect statement as
the merchant's exception does not re 
quire Jim's signature on the confirma 
tion form.

2.

0 is the correct answer. There was no
legal effect as to Tammy's exclamation,
since Mr. Baker had not made an offer
of any kind. A and B are incorrect be 
cause no offer was made, and there must
be a valid offer for there to be a bind 
ing acceptance or "meeting of the
minds." C is incorrect because no ex 
pressed qualifications were imposed
upon Tammy for her to receive the gift.

CONTRACTS am

7. C is the correct answer. A firm offer is
irrevocable without consideration for a
reasonable time, or for the time speci 
fied in the contract; but in no event for
a period of time longer than three
months. The offer must be made by a
merchant and involve the sale of goods.
A is incorrect since no consideration is
needed. B is incorrect, because the
u.e.e. holds firm offers open for three
months no longer. D is an incorrect
statement of law. Such is not required
by the u.e.C.

8. B is the correct answer. Dee's payment
of the lesser sum is not consideration
as the debt was undisputed. Therefore,
Mel's promise to accept the lesser sum
as payment in full is not enforceable. A
is an incorrect statement of law. C is
incorrect, because payment of the $400,
which was already owed, is not consid 
ered to be legal "consideration". D is
an incorrect answer for the same rea 
sons that B is correct.

5. A is the correct answer. Restatement
First Â§90 of Contracts, provides that a
promise which the promisor should rea 
sonably expect to induce action or for 
bearance and which does induce such,
is binding if injustice can be avoided
only by enforcement of the promise.
Here, it can be said that Mr. Baker
would have no reason to foresee the ac 
tion by Tammy; thus, his promise would
not be binding. D is incorrect because
it is not as concise as answer A. B is
incorrect because, whether or not Mr.
Baker intended reliance or not, is irrel 
evant to the applicable rule of law. C is
incorrect because it incorrectly states
the law. Tammy's conduct was not a
legal detriment and there was no bar 
gained for exchange.

6. B is the best answer. When a contract
calls for goods and services, the court
may apply the Predominant Purpose
Test. Under this test, if it is decided that
the predominant purpose of the contract
was for goods, then the Uniform Com 
mercial Code (U.C.e.) will apply. A is
incorrect because services are also in 
cluded; thus, the u.e.e. does not clearly
apply. C is incorrect, as the courts may,
under the Predominant Purpose Test,
decide that the u.e.e. applies. D is an
incorrect statement as the u.e.e. ap 
plies to goods, not services.

11m CONTRACTS

9. A is the correct answer. When there are
dealings between merchants, additional
or different terms become part of the
contract automatically after a reason 
able period of time, unless: 1) the offer
expressly limits acceptance to the terms
of the offer, 2) the additional or differ 
ent terms are a material alteration of the
offer, or 3) the original offeror notifies
the offeree that he objects to the addi 
tional or different terms within a com 
mercially reasonable period of time. B
is incorrect, as conduct by both parties
which recognizes the existence of a
contract, is sufficient to establish a con 
tract. C is incorrect for the reasons dis 
cussed in answer A. D is incorrect be 
cause the additional terms were likely
not significant to constitute a counter 
offer.

10. C is the correct answer. When a non 
merchant offeree proposes additional or
different terms in his acceptance, a con 
tract exists consisting of the terms
agreed upon, while the additional terms
are deemed a proposal for additional or
different terms. A is incorrect for the
same reasons that C is correct. B is in 
correct because the additional terms
would merely be considered proposals.
D is incorrect, since C is correct.

11. Under the U.c.c., D is the correct an 
swer. Where no place is specified for
delivery of the goods, the place of de 
livery is the seller's place of business,
or, if there is none, the seller's resi 
dence. Answers A, B, and C are all in 
correct for the reason stated in the cor 
rect answer D.

12. C is the correct answer. A unilateral
contract is one where an offer requires
performance of an act as bargained-for
consideration. The unilateral contract is
formed by doing the required act. A is
incorrect since a bilateral contract re 
quires an exchange of promises. B is
factually incorrect because the reward
was not intended as negotiation. D is
an incorrect statement, since a bilateral
contract requires an agreement prior to
the performance-which was not the case
here.

13. D is the correct answer. A reward offer
must be accepted by an offeree who
knows of the offer. Here, Annie did not
learn of the reward until after Fido's
return. A and B are incorrect for the rea 
sons discussed in correct answer D. C
is not correct because the issue is not
consideration, but whether or not the
offeree knew of the offer.

14. D is the correct answer. Anticipatory
repudiation does not apply in a contract
fully performed on the side of the
non-repudiating party.

CONTRACTS III

18. D is the best answer. Brent must notify
Selma of the rejection within a reason 
able time and must hold the goods with
reasonable care for a reasonable time
sufficient for Selma to remove the
goods. A is incorrect, as Brent is under
no obligation to send the roller blades
back. Answers Band C are incorrect as
Brent only need fulfill the requirements
discussed in correct answer D.

19. A is the correct answer. Incidental dam 
ages allow the buyer to recover any cost
or expense reasonably incurred which
are incidental to the seller's delay or
delivery of defective goods. Loss of
expected profit is not considered to be
an incidental damage and is, therefore,
not recoverable. Answers B, C and D
are all incorrect, as they all constitute
incidental damages and could be recov 
ered. CU.C.c. Â§2-8l5(l))

15. A is the best answer. The agreement
expressly stated that the motorcycle was
to be delivered on September 9. B is
not the best answer, since implied con 
ditions deal with fairness and justice. A
is a more concise answer. C is not the
best answer, since the delivery was not
an event which impliedly had to occur
to create an absolute duty to perform.
D is incorrect because the performances
were not mutually dependent.

16. A is the correct answer. u.C.C. Â§2-613
states that if the contract involves goods
that were identified when the contract
was made and the goods are destroyed
without fault of either party before the
risk of loss passed, the contract is
voided. B, C and D are incorrect for the
same reasons that A is correct.

17. D is the correct answer. A party bears
the risk of a mistake when he is aware
at the time that the contract is made,
that he has only limited knowledge with
respect to the facts to which the mis 
take relates-but treats his limited knowl 
edge as sufficient. In this case, Flint is
obligated to build the mall and pay the
increased costs. Flint assumed the risks
when it started the job. A is incorrect
because Flint's mistake will not excuse
its performance. B is incorrect, as
Rubble is not obligated to share in the
increased costs. C is an incorrect state 
ment. Although it will cut into Flint's
profits, the contract is not impracticable
to perform.

lEI CONTRACTS

20. C is the correct answer. An express
warranty can be created by any sample
or model which is made part of the ba 
sis of the bargain. Here, the demonstra 
tion would create an express warranty
that the curling iron shall conform to
the model used. Thus, the fact that it
took 2 minutes to curl her hair instead
of the 30 seconds, would be a breach of
the express warranty. A is an incorrect
statement oflaw. Under u.e.e. Â§2-318,
direct privity between the manufacturer
and the ultimate buyer is not required
for there to be a cause of action. B is
incorrect because this warranty requires
that the seller have reason to know of
the particular use of goods contem 
plated by the buyer, and the seller must
also be aware that the buyer is relying
on the seller's judgment. The facts do
not support the finding ofthose conclu 
sions. D is incorrect for the same rea 
sons that C is correct.

21. D is the correct answer. The mayor has
detrimentally relied. This satisfies the
requirement of vesting. A is incorrect
(although this answer could possibly
make sense if the subcontractor was
suing for the loss of use of some gift
arguably donated to him). B is incor 
rect because to be a creditor beneficiary,
there must be detrimental reliance or a
suit brought on the contract. An ad 
vancement of salary is not necessarily
detrimental reliance- it is consideration.
C is incorrect because it is not the best
answer.

22. D is the correct answer. For the general
contractor to be able to indemnify him 
self, there must obviously be a valid
contract between himself and the sub 
contractor. A is incorrect. A general con 
tractor is responsible for the breach of
independent contractors. Mayor can sue
general contractor. B is incorrect as the
subcontractor could be seen as an obli 
gor; however, this bears no relation on
whether Mayor can sue the general con 
tractor. C is incorrect, as this bears no
relation to the suit between the subcon 
tractor and the general contractor.

23. C is the correct answer. Girkin is an in 
cidental beneficiary. A is incorrect, as
Girkin is not an intended beneficiary.
B is incorrect. An officious inter 
meddler is a remedies issue- this answer
would make no sense here. D is incor 
rect. Rights of the third party benefi 
ciary can be cut off up to the time that
they have vested. Here, there are no
vested rights. Girkin is merely an inci 
dental beneficiary.

CONTRACTS IE

24. B is the correct answer. If the subcon 
tractor has made partial performance or
a substandard performance, Mayor had
the right to offset against any incom 
pleteness to the performance ofthe con 
tract. Also, Mayor could actually be
owed damages, if she has been placed
in a position that is worse than before
the subcontractor performed the duty
under the contract. A is incorrect. The
general contractor's actions are not re 
lated to the suit between Mayor and the
general contractor. C is incorrect as "le 
gal detriment" refers to action of the
promisee taken in reliance upon the
actions of the promisor. D is an incor 
rect statement of law.

25. D is the correct answer. The communi 
cation between the parties has not yet
reached a point where vesting could
occur in Girkin. A is incorrect. Girkin
has not bargained for legal detriment.
None of his actions show that he has
offered any consideration. Further, there
are no facts to indicate donative intent
exists toward Girkin. B is incorrect.
There was no promise on which Girkin
could reasonably rely. C is incorrect
because, if the parties know someone
has reasonably relied, there can be an
action for restitution, but no facts indi 
cate reliance in this case to be reason 
able.

1m CONTRACTS

26. B is the correct answer. Ped received
medical treatment from the doctor,
which implies a promise by Ped to pay
for the services received. Answers C
and D are incorrect because the status
of Doctor as a beneficiary would give
him the right to sue Axel, not Ped. C is
incorrect because quasi-contractual re 
covery is not the best recovery, and also
is not the best theory of recovery be 
cause an implied-in-fact contract exists.

27. A is the correct answer, because Doc 
tor could only proceed against Axel as
a third party beneficiary of the Ped-Axel
contract. B is an incorrect statement of
law. C is incorrect because Axel's det 
rimental reliance on Ped's release has
no relevance to Doctor's right ofrecov 
ery. D is an incorrect statement of law.

28. B is the correct answer. Grease only
promised to represent Ped. This prom 
ise did not confer third party beneficiary
status on Doctor. A is incorrect because,
whether Doctor's rights have vested or
not, is irrelevant to this fact-pattern. C
is incorrect because there are no facts
to support this contention. D is incor 
rect because Doctor is not a beneficiary
of Grease's promise.

29. C is the correct answer. A promise "not
to assign" will not prevent an assign 
ment. However, this does constitute a
breach of promise not to assign. For the
reasoning discussed in correct answer
C, A and B are both incorrect. D is in 
correct, since it is an incorrect statement
of law.

30. D is the correct answer (for Bar Exam
purposes). The Restatement II of Con-
tracts is followed where the terms
"creditor" and "donee" beneficiary (see
Restatement I) have been replaced with
the term "intended" beneficiary. (Note
that a majority of states still follow the
Restatement I, which results in a dif-
ferent answer.) A, B, and C are incor-
rect for the reasons D is correct.

31. B is the correct answer. Design Factory
is a beneficiary and, thus, subject to any
defenses which may arise. A is incor-
rect, as it misstates the law. C is incor-
rect because vesting is only at issue
when the original parties are trying to
change the beneficiary rights. D is an
incorrect statement of law.

32. C is the correct answer. There was no
enforceable rights at the time of the as-
signment because no enforceable con-
tract existed. Therefore, A and Dare
incorrect. B is incorrect because this
would not justify Soprano's recovery.

33. D is the correct answer. Whistler's as-
signment to Fork was a delegation of
his duty. Thus, when Fork performed,
Van Gogh's duty became absolute. A is
incorrect under these facts. B is incor-
rect because the assignment and delega-
tion act as a substitute for privity. C is
incorrect because that fact alone is not
enough to subject Van Gogh to liabil-
ity.

34. A is the correct answer. Every delega-
tion gives rise to a third-party benefi-
ciary contract. Therefore, Van Gogh has
a cause of action against Fork. B is in-
correct only because it is not the best
answer. C is incorrect because the facts
do not support the answer. D is incor-
rect because A is correct.

35. C is the correct answer. When a party
to a contract delegates their duty, they
remain liable as guarantor for the per-
formance of the delegatee. D is incor-
rect because there are not enough facts
to support this choice. A is incorrect be-
cause of the rule stated in answer C. B
is an incorrect statement of law.

36. B is the correct answer. Under UCC
Section 2-312, a warranty of title must
be disclaimed by specific language. The
provision for sale of "any right, title and
interest" is not an exclusion or dis-
claimer of the warranty of title. Further,
the provision disclaiming warranties is
ineffective as to title, for its failure to
disclaim the warranty of title specifi-
cally. A, C and D are incorrect for the
reasons stated in correct answer B.

37. A is the best answer. Ed made an ex-
press warranty to Joe, regarding specific
attributes of the boat that were not true.
B is incorrect because A is the better
answer. C and D are incorrect for the
reasons stated in the explanation to an-
swer A.

CONTRACTS IfD

38. A is the correct answer. Under uee
section 2-206, an offer may be accepted
by any reasonable medium. An offer
may be accepted by either a return
promise or by specific acts. Marine's
act of shipping the motors constituted
acceptance of Bill's offer. Band e are
incorrect because they are incorrect
statements of law. D is incorrect be 
cause Marine failed to give notice that
the shipment was an accommodation.

39. B is correct. uee Section 2-608 pro 
vides that a buyer may revoke or reject
the whole shipment, or accept any com 
mercial unit, and reject the rest. A is
incorrect because a buyer must give
notice within a reasonable time of re 
jection. e and D are incorrect state 
ments of law.

40. A is the correct answer. Under uee
section 2-205, an offer by a merchant,
in a signed writing which by its terms
gives assurances to keep the offer open,
is not revocable for a period not to ex 
ceed three months. B, e and D are in 
correct statements of law.

41. D is the correct answer. Under uee 2 
207(2), where parties to a contract for
the sale of goods are both merchants,
the proposed additional terms become
part of the contract unless: (1) the offer
expressly limits acceptance to the terms
of the offer; (2) the additional terms
would materially alter the contract; or
(3) the offeror notifies the offeree within
a reasonable period of time that he ob 
jects to the additional terms. Because
Grocer's response was an inquiry to
eanco's offer, the terms will be con 
strued as a proposal and will become
part of the contract. A, Band e are in 
correct for the reasons stated in correct
answer D.

42. e is the correct answer. uee 2-601 pro 
vides where goods or tender of deliv 
ery fails in any respect to conform to
the contract, the buyer may reject ten 
der (perfect tender rule). A is incorrect
because substantial performance does
not apply under the Uec. B is incor 
rect for the same reasons that answer A
is incorrect. D is incorrect because of
the perfect tender rule.

IE CONTRACTS

43. A is correct. uee 2-601 provides a
buyer may accept a non-conforming
tender. Under 2 -714, buyer's accep 
tance of partial tender does not operate
as a waiver and buyer can recover dam 
ages. B is incorrect because the materi 
ality of seller's breach is not decisive.
The buyer is entitled to recover dam 
ages for any unexcused failure. e is in 
correct because acceptance of partial
tender does not operate as a waiver. D
is incorrect because a non- conforming
shipment constitutes a breach.

44. D is the correct answer. As between
merchants, a written confirmation is
sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds,
unless written objection is given within
10 days of receipt. A, Band e are in 
correct statements of law.

45. e is the correct answer. Section 2-313
provides that any affirmation of fact or
promise, relating to the goods in which
a buyer could rely, creates an express
warranty. Since Robin had actual
knowledge of Martin's accident prior
to her purchase of the Forge, she could
not have relied on the express affirm 
ations by Forge in its brochure. A, B
and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in the explanation to answer C.

46. e is the correct answer. An offer of re 
ward is an offer for performance. Since
Ethel did not deliver the brief case, and
Smith effectively revoked the offer
when he informed Ethel that he was
canceling the reward, no contract was
formed. A is incorrect because Ethel
cannot orally accept the reward - a uni 
lateral contract can only be accepted by
performance and she has not returned
the brief case. B is incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in correct answer e. D is
incorrect because Smith effectively re 
voked the offer.

47. e is the correct answer. X's offer called
for acceptance by performance, so the
mailing of the letter by Y (a promise to
perform) had no legal effect. The mail 
box rule only applies to bilateral con 
tracts. When Y learned of X's prior pur 
chase, an indirect revocation took place.
Thus, no contract was formed. A is in 
correct since X's offer requires accep 
tance by performance. Band D are in 
correct for the same reasons that e is
correct

CONTRACTS 1m

48. D is the correct answer. An offeree's
power of acceptance is terminated when
the offeror takes definite action incon 
sistent with an intention to enter into
the proposed contract, and the offeree
has reliable information to that effect.
When Y learned of X's prior purchase
of the truck, Y had notice of X's con 
duct that was inconsistent with X's in 
tent to subsequently buy Y's truck. A
and B are incorrect for reasons stated
in correct answer D. C is an incorrect
statement of law because only an off 
eror has the power to terminate his of 
fer.

49. D is the correct answer. Because Dan
is not a party, nor an intended benefi 
ciary to the Jack-Bill agreement, Dan
cannot raise the argument that the Jack 
Bill agreement is not in writing as a
defense because he does not have stand 
ing to do so. Dan cannot assert the de 
fense that the Jack-Dan agreement is not
in writing because such agreement was
a construction/building contract that, by
its terms, could be completed within one
year, and otherwise does not fall within
the Statute of Frauds. A, Band Care
incorrect for the reasons stated in the
explanation to answer D.

50. C is the correct answer. The Jack-Dan
agreement calls for performance in
separate units making the contract di 
visible. Upon Dan's performance of
completing the pool and bleachers,
Jack's performance of paying $5,000
became due. By Jack repudiating the
contract, and failing to pay the second
installment, Dan may also sue for the
damages caused by Jack's repudiation
of the remainder of the contract. Dan
would be excused from any further ob 
ligation under the contract. A, Band D
are incorrect for the reasons stated in
the explanation to answer C.

51. B is the correct answer. The Parol Evi 
dence Rule provides that when parties
have placed their agreement into a writ 
ing, which they both agree and assent
to as their full and complete integrated
agreement, evidence of oral or written
terms will not be admitted to change or
vary the terms of the writing. However,
where the parties reduce their agree 
ment to a writing, without language that
the writing is fully integrated, parol
evidence is admissible to show there is
a condition precedent to the legal ef 
fectiveness of the writing. Since the
parties orally agreed that the sale would
occur only upon Bar candidate passing
his bar exam parol evidence of that con 
dition precedent is admissible. A, C and
D are incorrect for the stated reasons to
answer B.

lEI CONTRACTS

52. D is the correct answer. DeC Â§2-508
states that where any tender or delivery
by the seller is rejected because of
non-conformance, and the time for per 
formance has expired, the buyer may
properly reject the non-conforming ten 
der. Here, Buyer properly rejected
Seller's tender of the milk, that was
short 1,000 cartons, because the time
for Seller's performance had expired.
A is incorrect because the contract is
not objectively impossible to perform.
Band e are incorrect statements for the
reasons stated in the explanation to an 
swerD.

53. D is the correct answer. A liquidated
damages clause will be upheld where
the stipulated sum bears a reasonable
relation to the actual loss, actual dam 
ages are uncertain or difficult to ascer 
tain, and the contract, as a whole ,evi 
dences a conscious intention of the par 
ties to consider and adjust the damages
that might flow from the breach. None
of these factors are present, particularly
since Americo was able to resell the
equipment before seeking liquidated
damages, and thus was able to ascer 
tain its actual damages. A, Band Care
incorrect for the reasons stated above.

54. A is the correct answer. A shipment con 
tract was formed, since the contract re 
quired Manufacturer to deliver the
chairs. Once Manufacturer placed the
chairs upon the carrier, the risk of loss
passed to Baker because the contract
provided EO.B. at seller's place of busi 
ness. Since the risk ofloss was on Baker
and Manufacturer placed the chairs
upon the carrier, he is entitled to the
contract price despite the language in
the contract, Manufacture could assign
its right to collect from Baker. B is in 
correct, as stated in correct answer A.
e and D are an incorrect statements of
law per DeC Â§2-204.

55. e is the correct answer. The risk ofloss
passed, once Manufacturer placed the
chairs upon the carrier to Baker. Since
Baker has the risk, he is unable to re 
cover against Manufacturer. A, Band
D are incorrect for the reasons stated in
C.

56. e is the correct answer. Billy Joe will
not be limited to receive only damages;
he can rescind the contract because
Jermey misrepresented a fact that re 
lates to an essential part of the bargain.
A, Band D are incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in correct answer C.

CONTRACTS 1m

60. A is the correct answer. Tom accepted
SecureCo's offer at the price of $5,000,
creating a contract for that amount.
SecureCo bore the risk that his supplier
would not be able to provide compo 
nents at the price bid by the supplier.
B, C and D are incorrect for the reason
stated above.

61. D is the correct answer. Based on the
doctrine of promissory estoppel, when
a contractor detrimentally relies on the
bid of a subcontractor in making its own
bid on a project, the subcontractor is es 
topped from denying that an option con 
tract was created, to the extent neces 
sary to avoid injustice, when the con 
tractor was induced to rely on the
subcontractor's bid. When BurgCo
(subcontractor) failed to perform,
SecureCo (contractor) may enforce its
right to obtain the amount of its loss,
based on the reliance when BurgCo
would not fulfill its obligation. A, Band
C are incorrect for this reason.

62. A is the correct answer. There must be
a meeting of the minds (mutual assent)
between the parties in order to have a
binding contract. Since there was no
meeting of the minds in this example,
there was no contract. B, C and Dare
incorrect for this reason.

57. A is the correct answer. In order for a
third party beneficiary to recover for a
promisor's breach of contract, she must
be either a donee or creditor beneficiary.
Wendy's guarantee of the loan merely
made her an incidental beneficiary of
BCl's promise to obtain the higher pos 
sible price for the sale of Bombay's as 
sets. B, C and D are incorrect for the
reasons stated in the explanation to an 
swer A.

58. C is the best answer. UCC Â§2-601 re 
quires perfect tender such that if the
goods or tender of delivery are noncon 
forming in any respect, the buyer may
reject the whole delivery, accept the
whole, or accept part of the delivery and
reject the rest. Since the shutters were
nonconforming, the shipment was prop 
erly refused. A is incorrect because Lion
had the right to reject. B is incorrect
because Lion has the right to reject non 
conforming goods, despite Prevention's
acceptance. D is incorrect because Lion
still could reject non-conforming goods
even if sent as an accommodation.

59. B is the correct answer. Under UCC
Â§2-508, a seller may seasonably notify
the buyer of an intention to cure and
may make a conforming delivery within
the contract time if a non-conforming
tender or delivery is rejected. A, C and
D are incorrect because of the reasons
stated in the explanation to answer B.

11m CONTRACTS

66. B is the correct answer. Where a party
expressed a future inability to perform,
he has not repudiated the contract. An 
ticipatory repudiation occurs where one
party to an executory bilateral contract
repudiates the contract in advance of the
time set for performance, by stating
unequivocally that he will not perform
the contract. Thus, Leon did not breach
the contract by repudiation when he
stated he did not think he could perform
the remodeling work. A, e and Dare
incorrect for the above reasons.

67. A is the correct answer. Tromp is en 
titled to the damages he suffered as a
result of the loss of his bargain with
Leon. Loss of bargain damages are
measured by the difference between
contract price and market value of the
breached performance, at the time and
place the contract was to be performed.
Since Tromp contracted to pay an ad 
ditional $200,000 to Ivan to complete
the work, this is the difference between
the contract price and market value, i.e
is the amount recoverable by Tromp. B,
e and D are incorrect for the above rea 
sons.

63. A is the correct answer. The uee
Â§2-205 "firm offer" rule provides that
where a merchant makes a signed, writ 
ten offer to buy or sell goods that gives
assurances that it will be held open, such
is irrevocable, absent consideration,
during the stated period or, if no time is
stated, for a reasonable time (not to ex 
ceed three months). B, e and D are in 
correct under the above rule.

64. D is the correct answer. uee Â§2-207
provides that, between merchants, ad 
ditional terms become part of the con 
tract, unless they materially alter it.
Requesting delivery of 150 pounds of
fresh olives that could spoil, in Novem 
ber instead of October, materially al 
tered the terms of the contract. Thus,
the court will give effect to the original
terms of the offer. A, Band e are incor 
rect for the reasons stated in the expla 
nation to answer D.

65. B is the correct answer. Under uee Â§2 
607(3), a buyer who accepts tender of
goods from a seller, must notify the
seller of any breach within a reasonable
time after he discovers or should have
discovered the breach, or he is barred
from any remedy. Since Mario accepted
the non-conforming olives, he must
notify Oliva eo. oftheir non-merchant 
able quality, in order to have any rem 
edy against the seller. A, e and Dare
incorrect for the above reasons.

CONTRACTS lED

71. D is the correct answer. Answer I is in 
correct because Buyer was not answer 
ing for Seller's debt. Instead, the
Buyer-Seller agreement made Creditor
an intended third party beneficiary of
the agreement. Such need not be in writ 
ing to be enforceable. Answer II is in 
correct because, even though a contract
for the sale of an interest in land must
be in writing to be enforceable, parol
evidence is admissible to correct a mis 
take in the contract. A, Band C are in 
correct for the reasons stated in the cor 
rect answer D.

72. C is the correct answer. The parol evi 
dence rule provides when a written con 
tract is entered into between parties
where the writing is intended to be the
full and complete integration of their
agreement, evidence of prior or written
terms will not be permitted for the pur 
pose of changing or altering the writ 
ten terms. However, there are excep 
tions to the rule: fraud, duress, mistake,
illegality and lack of consideration.
Here, the secretary mistakenly put in the
term $134,000 instead of $135,000.
Thus, parol evidence could be intro 
duced to show the actual price for Par 
cel because of the mistake. A, Band D
are incorrect for the above reasons
stated in C.

68. C is the correct answer. Green and
Brown made a contract that was ex 
pressed in a writing, to which they both
assented to be a complete and accurate
integration. Parol evidence does not al 
low any terms made prior to or contem 
poraneously with, to vary or contradict
the terms of the writing. A is incorrect
for the reasons stated in C. B is an in 
correct statement of law. D is irrelevant
to the facts as stated.

69. D is the correct answer. Where there is
a mutual mistake, such as here, is no
defense to a breach of contract that the
mistake was one ofjudgment. Here both
parties erroneously thought there would
not be any change during the term of
the lease. Therefore Dick is liable to
Willy for his failure to pay his rent de 
spite the decline in business. A is in 
correct, because it is not objectively
impossible to pay the rent. B is an in 
correct statement of law. C is incorrect,
because D is the more precise answer.

70. D is the correct answer. Since Dawn
failed to perform first, if the court finds
that her failure was not a material
breach, Tony's duties would not be ex 
cused. A is incorrect because the con 
tract called for performance as a whole.
B is incorrect because her performance
is not objectively impossible. C is in 
correct because D is more precise.

lEI CONTRACTS

73. B is the correct answer. A contract is
not enforceable, unless it is supported
by consideration. Since the facts do not
indicate that Lisa gave any consider 
ation, no contract based upon the above
facts was formed. A and D are incor 
rect because B is the more precise an 
swer. C is incorrect because this would
not be the best defense. Rather, this
would hinder Allen's claim that the con 
tract is unenforceable.

74. C is the correct answer. Statement I is
correct because Allen told the doctor he
would pay his fees before Doctor
treated Lisa for her injuries resulting in
Doctor's reliance (i.e., this is a valid
substitute for consideration). Further,
statement II is correct because if Allen
had a contract with Lisa, Doctor would
be a third party beneficiary to the
Allen-Lisa contract. Upon Allen telling
Doctor he would pay, Doctor's rights
vested. A, Band D are incorrect for the
same reasons that C is correct.

75. A is the correct answer. Since Doctor
performed his services to Lisa for her
injuries, she received a benefit. To al 
low her to not pay would be contrary to
public policy. B is incorrect because it
is irrelevant. C and D are incorrect for
the reasons that A is correct.

76. B is the best answer. The Statute of
Frauds requires contracts be in writing:
(1) for the transfer of an interest in land
or, (2) which cannot be completed
within one year of the date of contract 
ing. While Terry will argue that her pay 
ments and improvements are part per 
formance of the contract, thereby tak 
ing it out of the Statute of Frauds, her
actions are also consistent with her prior
relationship with Oliver, as a month 
to-month tenant. A and D are incorrect
for this reason. C is an incorrect state 
ment of law.

77. B is the correct answer. The Statute of
Frauds requires a contract for the sale
of land to be in writing. However, par 
tial payments by Terry takes the oral
agreement outside the statute. A is in 
correct because it does not fall within
an exception to the Statute of Frauds.
C and D are incorrect for the reasons
stated in correct answer B.

78. B is the correct answer. Where parties
enter into a transaction under a mistake
regarding a fact assumed by each party
which is the basis of the bargain for
which they enter into the contact, it is
voidable by either party, if enforcement
would materially alter that which was
bargained for. Here, Denny bargained
for a 1916 "D" dime that turned out to
be counterfeit. Thus, the contract can be
rescinded. A, C and D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in correct answer B.

CONTRACTS lEI

82. Ais the correct answer. Kemper's omis 
sion of the $301,769 price from the
company's bid was a material, unilat 
eral mistake. A unilateral mistake is
grounds for rescission. B is incorrect
because it is an incorrect statement of
law. e is incorrect because it assumes
facts not given in the question. D is in 
correct because a submitted bid can be
withdrawn- prior to its acceptance, as
here.

83. e is the correct answer. Under the uee,
when the contract requires buyer's pay 
ment before he receives the goods, such
payment is not an acceptance of the
goods. Therefore, Bob has retained his
right to inspect the wool despite his pay 
ment for the goods. A, Band D are in 
correct for this reason.

84. e is the correct answer because it is a
correct statement of the amount of dam 
ages recoverable to a buyer when the
seller has tendered nonconforming
goods. Bob will seek damages in the
amount of the price paid, plus an
amount for reimbursement of the price
to purchase substitute (No.1 quality)
goods. A, Band D are incorrect for the
same reasons that e is correct.

79. A is the correct answer. A contract en 
tered into by a minor, except for neces 
sities, are voidable at the election of the
minor, and may be disaffirmed by the
minor during minority or within a rea 
sonable time after reaching majority.
The continuing payments and use of the
car by Rodgers after reaching the age
of majority constituted affirmation of
the contract. B is incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in correct answer A. e is
incorrect because not all contracts en 
tered into by minors are voidable (e.g.,
necessities). D is incorrect because,
under the majority rule, a minor does
not have to return the merchandise to
have a valid disaffirmance.

80. D is the correct answer. A contract en 
tered into by a minor is voidable and
can be disaffirmed up until majority, or
a reasonable time thereafter. A is incor 
rect because the majority rule does not
require the minor to return the merchan 
dise. Band e are incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in correct answer D.

81. e is correct because a seller has a duty
to disclose any information involving
latent dangerous conditions on the prop 
erty. Mr. Tibbs had knowledge of the
contaminated well, and failed to dis 
close. This amounted to a fraudulent
misrepresentation. A and B are incor 
rect because it incorrectly states the law.
D is incorrect because fraudulent mis 
representation is a basis to rescind a
contract.

lEI CONTRACTS

85. B is the correct answer. Under the uee,
if a seller does not give the buyer in 
structions on how to dispose of non 
conforming goods, a buyer may resell
the goods, store the goods, or reship the
goods back to seller. If the buyer intends
to resell the goods at a private sale, he
must give the seller reasonable notice
of his intention to do so. A, e and Dare
incorrect for the reasons stated above.

86. A is the correct answer. Melissa's offer
was for a unilateral contract, which can
only be accepted by the doing of the
act requested in the offer and not by a
return promise. B is incorrect because
a unilateral contract would only be
formed when Nancy performed the re 
quired act of coming to the office be 
fore or after work, not by mailing an
acceptance. e is incorrect because it is
an untrue statement of fact. D is incor 
rect because Melissa's offer was for a
unilateral contract.

87. e is the correct answer. Under u.c.c.
Â§2-205, a firm offer applies only to an
offer made by a merchant. A, Band D
are incorrect because the common law
rule is that a promise of irrevocability
must be supported by consideration.

88. B is the correct answer. Marty had an
option for 60 days. His counter-offer of
April 5, 1993, did not terminate that
option. A is incorrect because it is not
the best answer. Although a contract
was formed, it was breached because
of Tim selling Midnight to an innocent
third party. e is incorrect because
Marty's counter-offer does not termi 
nate his option. D is incorrect because
it is an incorrect statement of law.

89. D is the correct answer. Although the
counter-offer, in an option contract,
does not terminate the power to accept
the offer, if the optionor (Tim) detrimen 
tally relies upon the rejection, the power
to accept terminates at the time of reli 
ance. Here, the time of reliance would
have been when Tim sold the mare. A
is incorrect because of the reasoning
stated in correct answer D. B is not the
best answer, although Marty was aware
of the sale of Midnight on this date. e
is incorrect because the option to ac 
cept was for 60 days. The counter-offer
would not terminate the option contract.

CONTRACTS 11m

93. B is the correct answer. For Con to win,
it must be shown that he neither had
actual nor constructive knowledge of
the miscalculation. A is incorrect be 
cause John would not be bound by the
contract if Con knew of the miscalcu 
lation. C is an incorrect statement of
law. D is incorrect because there was
an anticipatory breach of contract.

94. A is the correct answer. John was un 
der a pre-existing duty to do the work
for $80,000. There is no consideration
to support Con promising to pay the
additional $4,000. B is incorrect be 
cause whether or not Con intended to
pay the additional amount is irrelevant.
C is incorrect because of the pre-exist 
ing duty. D is an incorrect statement of
fact.

95. C is the correct answer. Sterling had
essentially complied with the provision,
and only had the records at the store for
inventory purposes. Thus, he reason 
ably satisfied the insurance provision.
A is incorrect because Sterling had at 
tempted to fulfill his performance un 
der the contract. B is incorrect because
the facts do not indicate that the provi 
sion was an express condition. D is an
incorrect statement of law.

90. C is the correct answer. Under U.e.e.
Â§2- 207, proposed new terms in a con 
tract between merchants do not termi 
nate the offer and become part of that
contract, unless: (1) the offer is limited
to its own terms; (2) the terms materi 
ally alter the contract; and (3) the off 
eror objects within a reasonable time.
These three conditions were not met. A
and B are incorrect because Tim and
Marty are both merchants; thus, u.e.e.
Â§2-207 would apply. D, although a cor 
rect answer, is not the best answer be 
cause D, without justification, assumes
that Tim objects to the terms.

91. B is the correct answer. A bilateral con 
tract consists of a promise in exchange
for a promise. Here, Morrocam Com 
pany agreed to give Matt lifetime em 
ployment in exchange for a reduced
wage. A, although a correct statement
of law, is not the best answer. C and D
are incorrect, because they misstate the
common law.

92. B is the correct answer. All of the nec 
essary terms needed to satisfy the re 
quirement of a sufficient memorandum,
under the u.e.e., are contained in Gil's
note. A is incorrect because, without the
memo, Gil is only liable for the glasses
he has accepted. C is incorrect because
a repudiation by one party, does not ter 
minate a valid contract. D is incorrect
because the note does satisfy the Stat 
ute of Frauds.

1m CONTRACTS

96. D is the correct answer. When the of 
feree dispatches an acceptance and
changes his mind and dispatches a re 
pudiation, when such repudiation
reaches the offeror first, there is, nev 
ertheless, a valid contract - unless the
offeror relies to his detriment on the
rejection. A is incorrect because of the
reasoning in correct answer D. B is an
incorrect statement of law. e is incor 
rect because the telephone is a reason 
able method of communication, under
these circumstances.

97. A is the correct answer. The parties to a
valid bilateral contract, which is partly
unperformed on each side, may agree
to a discharge of all remaining duties.
The consideration is provided by each
party's discharge of the other's duties.
B is incorrect because there was mu 
tual assent when Jim accepted Rod's
offer. e and D are incorrect for the same
reason that A is correct.

98. D is the correct answer. Only if Home 
owner had known that Renoir's bid was
made through error, could he not re 
cover. A is legally irrelevant. Band e
are incorrect statements of law.

99. B is the correct answer. Renoir was
under a pre-existing duty to paint
Homeowner's home for $5,500. Fur 
ther, Homeowner's promise to pay an
additional $600 was not supported by
consideration. A is incorrect because
there is no reason that the promise to
pay additional money be in writing. e
is incorrect because the detrimental
reliance does not cure the lack of con 
sideration. D is incorrect because it is
an untrue statement of law.

100. e is the correct answer. Traditionally,
the pre-existing duty rule, and the
promise for increased performance,
could not be enforced, due to lack of
consideration. Modernly, courts permit
the modification, where it is fair and
equitable. A is incorrect for the reasons
stated in correct answer e. B is incor 
rect because the promise did not need
to be in writing. D is incorrect because
"detrimental reliance" is used where a
substitute for consideration is required.
Here, there was a valid modification
supported by consideration.

10 1. A is the best answer. The U.e.e. would
not apply to this contract, since it in 
volves services. B is incorrect, because
it is irrelevant. e is an incorrect appli 
cation of law to fact. D is incorrect.
Although v.c.e. Â§2-609 permits a
party to a sales contract to demand "as 
surance of performance," the V.e.e.
would not apply to this fact pattern.

CONTRACTS lEI

105. D is the correct answer. Where the in 
ducement of a party's promise is a past
event or benefit, the past consideration
is not sufficient to render the party's
promise enforceable. A is incorrect
because the consideration was past
consideration. B is an incorrect state 
ment of fact. C is an incorrect state 
ment, as applied to these facts.

106. B is the correct answer. An assignee
takes a contract subject to defenses
against his assignor. If Roofer has not
properly performed, this defense could
be used by Pet Shop. A is incorrect be 
cause it is irrelevant whether or not Mr.
Nail is capable of applying a roof. C is
incorrect because an agreement not to
assign destroys the right, but not the
power to assign, e.g. the right to re 
ceive payment. D is incorrect, because
Mr. Nail is not claiming to be a third
party beneficiary, but rather is claim 
ing to be an assignee.

107. A is the correct answer. Wife had no
vested rights under the policy, since
any rights were expressly subject to
Isac's power to change beneficiaries.
B is an incorrect application of the
facts to the law. C is an incorrect state 
ment of law. D is incorrect because,
although at one time she was a donee
beneficiary, Isac used his power to
change beneficiaries and made his
daughter the sole beneficiary.

102. B is the best answer. In a bilateral con 
tract, each party's promise supplies
consideration. Thus, if one party's
promise does not subject him to a le 
gal detriment, it does not supply the
requisite consideration, and the other
party's promise is not enforceable. A
is incorrect because an illusory prom 
ise generally arises where one party
makes a promise in exchange for a
promise that does not limit the other's
future options. Here, Betty made no
promise in exchange for Harley's
promise so no issue of illusory prom 
ise arises. C is incorrect because the
Statute of Frauds is not applicable to
this fact pattern. D is a correct state 
ment of fact but B is the better answer.

103. C is the correct answer. Statement I is
correct because Harley's promise in
advance of the doctor's performance
would give rise to detrimental reliance.
Statement II is correct because the
Harley-Betty contract could make the
doctor an intended third party benefi 
ciary

104. D is the correct answer. There is a
bargaine-for-exchange under these
facts. Harley will pay, if Creditor will
not file a claim. A is incorrect because
one can bring a claim against the es 
tate of a deceased person. B is incor 
rect because there was consideration.
C is incorrect because promissory es 
toppel is not applicable to these facts.

11m CONTRACTS

108. D is the correct answer. Isac named his
daughter as a donee beneficiary. A is
an incorrect statement of law. B is in 
correct because borrowing against the
policy would not extinguish the
daughter's rights as a donee benefi 
ciary. C is incorrect because public
policy, as presently interpreted, does
not so mandate.

109. C is the correct answer. The assign 
ment would be viewed as an exercise
of the power inherent in the contract.
A and B are incorrect statements of
law. D is incorrect since, even if the
assignment were gratuitous, the out 
come would be the same.

110. D is the correct answer. The general
rule is that the assignee is subject to
the same defenses that the obligor has
against the assignee. If Eva had not
performed properly, Elva would have
a defense against her, and could use
this defense against Flora. Although
the facts do not stipulate this derelic 
tion in performance, the answer does.
As a general strategy with multistate
questions, it is better that all of the facts
appear in the fact pattern. Neverthe 
less, when the three remaining options
are clearly incorrect, as here, this kind
of answer is correct. A is incorrect be 
cause Flora is an assignee, not a ben 
eficiary. B is incorrect because it is le 
gally immaterial to these facts. C is a
correct statement of law; however, fur 
nishing the flowers would not be
deemed to be a personal service, and
thus the special services rule would not
be applicable. That is, C is an irrelevant
statement of law.

111. D is the correct answer. A new prom 
ise to perform an obligation which is
voidable, will be enforced so long as
the new promise is not voidable for the
same reasons. The new promise is
called a ratification. A and B are in 
correct for the same reasons that D is
correct. C is incorrect because the writ 
ing itself is not at issue based upon
these facts.

CONTRACTS am

112. D is the correct answer. The u.e.e.
Statute of Frauds requires that the sale
of goods priced at $500 or more to be
in writing to be enforceable. Although
the original agreement was oral, a writ 
ten confirmation between merchants
may be binding on the party to be
charged, without signing, ifthe receiv 
ing party fails to object within 10 days
of receipt. While, the first written con 
firmation was not received, Cat will
assert that the protest letter, a second
confirmation, identifies the existence
of a contract, and therefore is suffi 
cient. A and B are incorrect for the rea 
soning stated in correct answer D. C,
although a correct answer, is not the
best answer, under the prevailing in 
terpretations given to the u.e.e.

113. A is the correct answer. When a check
marked "payment in full" is cashed for
a disputed debt, the courts generally
regard it as evidencing an accord and
satisfaction with the debtor. Therefore,
no further rights to additional payment
exist. Answers B, C and D are non 
sensical and irrelevant, when applied
to these specific facts.

114. C is the correct answer. An implied
novation occurs where: there has been
(1) an effective delegation; (2) the ob 
ligor repudiates liability to obligee
(Jag); and (3) the obligee accepts per 
formance of the delegatee (Cathy),
without reserving rights against the ob 
ligor. All of the above elements have
been satisfied, under the given facts.
A is an incorrect application of law. B
is incorrect because it is not a good ar 
gument for Tim, but a good argument
for Jag. D is incorrect for the same rea 
sons that C is correct.

115. B is the correct answer because only
Choices I and II are correct. Cat Im 
ports will be entitled to "cover" dam 
ages. Thus, it can purchase substitute
automobiles from another dealer, and
recover the difference in price from
Jag. Therefore, Choice I is correct. Cat
may also request specific performance,
Choice II. The u.e.e. provides that a
buyer may receive specific perfor 
mance, where the goods are unique (or
in other proper circumstances). If Cat
Imports is unable to locate the cars, Jag
may be required to deliver. Choice III
is incorrect because reformation is
clearly not an appropriate remedy
when a court has found that a valid
contract exists - as here stipulated. A,
C, and D are incorrect for the same
reasons that B is correct.

am CONTRACTS

116. B is the correct answer. There was an
agreement between Playgoer and Dr.
Othello based on the offer to pay later
for help from Doctor. A is an irrelevant
statement of law, because there was no
need to look for an implied contract
based on the rationale for answer B. C
and D are incorrect statements of law.

117. A is the correct answer because it pre-
sumes Matt was not incapacitated by
his drinking. A reasonable person
would have found Matt's statement to
be an offer, whether or not he made it
in jest. Therefore, the court will find a
valid contract, and Eileen can most
likely sue for specific performance. B
is incorrect because the court will en-
force the contract- most likely through
specific performance and A is the bet-
ter answer. C is incorrect because be-
ing drunk will not automatically act as
a defense. D is incorrect because
whether or not Matt's statement was
made in jest, a reasonable person
would find his statement to be an of-
fer and such is the correct legal stan-
dard.

118. A is the correct answer. The buyer's
remedy for non-conforming goods is:
damages measured by the contract
price differential, or by cover price. B
is incorrect, since it misstates the law,
regarding the measure of damage. C
is incorrect, since it is a misstatement
of law. D is incorrect because specific
performance would only be applicable
where the goods were unique or where
damages would be inadequate.

Il9. C is the correct answer. V.C.C.
Â§Â§2-711(3) and 2-706(2), (3), state that
when a buyer has paid for goods,
which are nonconforming and buyer
demands repayment, seller may resell
the goods either at a private or public
sale. However, if it is a private sale,
reasonable advance notice must be
given to the original buyer. A and B
are incorrect since they are incomplete
answers. D is an incorrect statement
of the law of the u.e.e.

120. D is the correct answer. Vnder V.e.e.
Â§2-512(2), pre-inspection payment
does not act as a waiver of inspection
or remedies. Answers A, Band Care
incorrect statements of law.

121. B is the correct answer. The personal
services appear to be routine, rather
than unique - thus, the duty will be
found delegable. A is incorrect since it
is unsupported by any facts. C and D
are incorrect applications of the given
facts to the law.

122. A is the best answer. Although a del-
egatee may be also be liable to the ob-
ligor/delegator, he is personally liable
for the performance to the obligee
(here, Candace), who is a creditor
beneficary of Tumi's promise. An-
swers Band C are therefore incorrect,
because they are incomplete. D is a
misstatement of the law.

CONTRACTS III

123. B is the correct answer. The offer was
a manifestation of an intent to be
bound. It was very specific. It de 
scribed the subject matter (skis) the
amount ($250), and was directed to a
specific group, (first come first serve.)
A is incorrect, since it is an offer - not
merely an invitation to deal. C is an
incorrect statement of law. D is incor 
rect, for the same reasons that B is cor 
rect.

124. D is the correct answer. The contract
stipulated EO.B., Seller's place of
business. Thus, the risk of loss passed
to Buyer. Seller would be entitled to
the contract price. Therefore, Son, as
the assignee, would be entitled to the
contract price. A is incorrect, because
the contract stated EO.B. Seller's place
of business. B is incorrect because
most contractual provisions, stating
that rights may not be assigned, is in 
effective. C is incorrect, since it mis 
states the law which is appropriate to
this fact pattern.

125. Ais the correct answer. The risk ofloss
had shifted to Buyer. B is incorrect,
because Seller had already delivered
the boats to the carrier. C and Dare
incorrect statements of law.

126. B is the correct answer. The typo was
a unilateral mistake. Further, Maestro
would have known of the mistake,
since he is an accomplished musician
and would know that a Stradivarius is
worth over a million dollars. A is in 
correct since it is not the best answer.
Specific performance is equitable in
certain situations; however, it is not in
this situation. C and D are incorrect for
the reasons stated in correct answer B.

127. A is the correct answer. A valid con 
tract was not formed because Sub gave
Builder a counter-offer rather than an
acceptance. B is incorrect because ac 
ceptance must be made by a reply, not
conduct. C is incorrect because if the
writing had been an acceptance, the
mailbox rule would apply. D is incor 
rect because at that stipulated time, Sub
no longer had the power to accept the
original offer.

128. D is the best defense. The Statute of
Frauds is applicable since the agree 
ment, by its terms, could not be per 
formed within one year of the making
thereof. Ais incorrect since Uncle Jed's
death is irrelevant to any agreement
between Elly Mae and Jethro. B is
likely factually incorrect and is also in 
correct because D is a better answer.
C is factually incorrect because argu 
ably some manifestation of intent
could be found between the parties.

11:1 CONTRACTS

129. D is the correct answer. Elly Mae's aca-
demic hard work would constitute
valid consideration. A is incorrect be-
cause there is consideration, as dis-
cussed in correct answer D. B is an
incorrect application of law. C is in-
correct because promissory estoppel is
a more appropriate argument when
there is a lack of consideration.

130. B is the correct answer. Pete is entitled
to sue on the basis of his bilateral con-
tract with Heather. A, although a cor-
rect statement, is not the best answer
because it fails to give legally appro-
priate reasons. C is incorrect because
it is irrelevant. There was a bargained-
for-exchange; and there are no issues
of fraud, etc. relevant here. D is an ir-
relevant statement of law, under the
given facts. There was an enforceable
contract

131. A is the correct answer. The offer was
an offer for an act (a unilateral con-
tract). Band C are incorrect because
the notice constituted contractual in-
tent. D is incorrect because the faculty
was, in fact, bargaining- by trying to
encourage moot court participation.

132. C is the correct answer. Laura in-
creased her efforts in reliance of P.D. 's
offer. Her intensified efforts would
constitute sufficient part performance.
A is incorrect because of the reason-
ing in correct answer C. Band Dare
incorrect and legally irrelevant state-
ments.

133. C is the correct answer. The offer con-
stituted a unilateral contract, since only
the act of winning the competition
would constitute the acceptance. A, B
and D are incorrect because of the rea-
soning in correct answer C.

134. A is the correct answer. P.D. 's prom-
ise was conditioned on the occurrence
of Laura winning. Band Care mis-
statements of law. D is incorrect for
the same reasons that A is correct.

135. D is the correct answer. Laura's death
would not terminate the offer because
she has already performed (turned in
the winning brief). A and Bare incor-
rect legal statements. C is incorrect be-
cause it misses the mark - there is no
reason to rely on promissory estoppel
principles.

136. B is the correct answer. Chopin's state-
ment that he might not be ready to start,
would not constitute an "unequivocal"
repudiation. A is incorrect because a
repudiation does not have to be in writ-
ing. C is incorrect because there was
not a definite repudiation. D is an in-
correct statement of law, as applied to
these facts.

CONTRACTS III

140. D is the correct answer. Under mod-
em law, a contract can be rescinded
orally. A is incorrect for the reasons
stated in correct answer D. B is an ir-
relevant factual statement, based on the
above law. C is incorrect because it is
legally irrelevant.

141. A is the correct answer. Although Cal
is in material breach, he may recover
in quasi-contract. B is an incorrect ap-
plication of the doctrine of impossibil-
ity. This doctrine requires there be
more than a mere shortage of funds. C
is incorrect because it is Cal who is in
material breach. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that A is the correct an-
swer.

142. C is the correct answer. Although Cal
is in material breach, he may recover
in quasi-contract. His recovery will be
based on restitution. A and B are in-
correct because of the analysis stated
in correct answer C. D is incorrect be-
cause Cal's breach was not willful.

143. B is the correct answer. Public policy
finds adhesion contracts unenforce-
able, since they represent gross in-
equality of bargaining position. A, al-
though a correct statement of fact, is
not a legal reason for recovery. C and
D are incorrect for the same reason that
B is correct.

137. B is the correct answer. An aggrieved
party is relieved of his obligation, only
where a material breach occurs. A 10-
day delay would likely not constitute
a material breach. A is incorrect be-
cause notification, under these facts,
does not constitute an anticipatory re-
pudiation. C is incorrect because such
is not a justifiable legal reason, stand-
ing alone, by which a contract is per-
mitted to be canceled. D is incorrect
because it is most likely that there was
no material breach, under their contract
and these facts.

138. B is the correct answer. Bugsy is en-
titled to be placed in the position he
would have been in, had Chopin fol-
lowed through with the contract. A is
incorrect because it does not account
for the other 11 months. C is incorrect
for the reasons stated in correct answer
B. D is incorrect because the damages
are $1,000 a month, not $4,000.

139. B is the correct answer because only
Choice II is correct. The Statute of
Frauds requires contract for the sale of
goods for $500 or more to be in writ-
ing. Choice I is incorrect because the
Statute of Frauds does not apply to a
contract for services, unless perfor-
mance cannot be completed within one
year of the making thereof. That is not
the situation here. A, C and Dare in-
correct because they either do not con-
tain correct Choice II, or contain in-
correct Choice I.

III CONTRACTS

144. A is the correct answer. Under u.e.e.
Â§2-206(l)(b), an offer to buy goods for
prompt shipment can be acceptable by
notice or by actual shipment. B is an
inapplicable statement oflaw. C is fac 
tually incorrect because the shipment
had already occurred before revoca 
tion. D is incorrect because it is legally
irrelevant.

145. D is the correct answer. Under U.e.e.
Â§2-206(1)(b), shipment is a legal ac 
ceptance, even if the goods shipped are
non-conforming. However, the ship 
ment of non-conforming goods is a
breach of contract. Thus, Buyer can re 
ject the goods. Answers A and B are
incorrect for the reasoning stated in
correct answer D. C is incorrect be 
cause Manufacturer did not state that
the non-conforming goods were only
accommodations.

146. C is the correct answer because Uni 
form Commercial Code (UCC) section
9-313 allows Earl's to prevail over any
person becoming a lien creditor, after
the security interest became perfected
by Earl's timely filing of the security
interest in the air conditioning system.
A is an incorrect statement of law. B is
incorrect because a secured interest is
not automatically perfected, absent a
filing. D is incorrect because, upon a
proper filing of a secured interest in
fixtures, that party is protected from
other creditors claiming an interest in
the fixture.

147. D is the correct answer. The FOB term
is a delivery term - even if only used
in conjunction with the price; thus, re 
quiring delivery from the seller to the
buyer's carrier to shift the risk of loss.
The risk of loss did not pass because
the container was merely loaded, not
delivered, at the time it was stolen. A
is incorrect because Sam did not de 
liver the goods by merely loading
Bob's shipping container. B is incor 
rect because there are not facts to sup 
port this contention. C is an incorrect
statement of law.

148. B is the best answer. UCC section
9-313(2) provides that no security in 
terest exists in ordinary building ma 
terials incorporated into an improve 
ment on land. Once John used the lum 
ber to construct the garage, Hardware
was prevented from having a security
interest in the goods. A is incorrect
because it is not as concise as B. Cis
incorrect because of the reasons stated
for answer B. D is an incorrect state 
ment of law, as it applies to ordinary
building materials such as lumber, dry 
wall or window glass.

CONTRACTS III

149. A is the correct answer. VCC section
9-313(4)(b) provides that, between a
fixture financier ("FRV") and a sub 
sequent real estate interest ("Continen 
tal"), the first secured party to file or
record prevails. Because FRV filed its
interest before Continental, FRV pre 
vails. B is incorrect because it is an in 
correct statement of the law. C is an
incorrect statement of the law as ap 
plied to a subsequent realty interest. D
is incorrect because Article 9 permits
fixture financiers to have a secured in 
terest in chattels affixed to realty.

150. D is the correct answer. VCC section
9-313(4)(a) permits a fixture financier
to defeat a pre-existing realty interest
when: (1) the fixture security interest
is a purchase money security interest,
(2) the fixture security interest is per 
fected by a fixture filing, (3) the filing
is made before the goods become fix 
tures or within twenty days thereafter,
and (4) the debtor has a recorded in 
terest or possession of the realty. Since
element 3 is missing, FRV's priority
claim against Intrastate is defeated. A
is incorrect because the grace period
is only 20 days. Band C are incorrect
because of the rule stated in the expla 
nation to answer D.

151. C is the best answer. VCC section
9-401(2) provides that an improper fil 
ing which is made in good faith is ef 
fective: (1) to the extent of the collat 
eral for which the filing was proper and
(2) against any person who actually
knows the contents of the financing
statement. Since part of George's de 
scription was proper, the filing is ef 
fective as to the properly-described
collateral. A, Band D each are incor 
rect statements of law.

152. C is the best answer. Although a se 
cured party may remove his collateral
upon default without resort to the ju 
dicial process, unless otherwise
agreed, he must do so without a breach
of the peace. Bob's smashing of the
cafe window was a breach of the peace
which is not permitted under Article
9. A, Band D are incorrect for the same
reasons that C is correct.

153. D is the correct answer. A secured
creditor of fixtures may remove his
collateral upon default, but he must re 
imburse any party, except the debtor,
for the cost of repair for the physical
damage caused by the fixture removal.
A, Band C are incorrect for the rea 
sons stated in the explanation to an 
swer D.

am CONTRACTS

154. A is the best answer. The implied war 
ranty of merchantability must be dis 
claimed by use ofthe term "merchant 
ability." The language in Tina's con 
tract made no mention of disclaiming
the implied warranty of merchantabil 
ity. Band e are incorrect because they
neglect to consider the attempted dis 
claimer of warranty. D is incorrect for
the reason stated in the explanation to
answer A.

155. D is the correct answer. Under uee
2-312, a seller of goods warrants that
she is conveying good title, that her
title is rightful, and that the goods will
be delivered free of security interest
or other liens. Paula did not have good
title at the time she sold the stereo to
Tracee, so she breached the warranty
of title to Tracee. A, Band e are in 
correct for the reasons stated in the
explanation to answer D.

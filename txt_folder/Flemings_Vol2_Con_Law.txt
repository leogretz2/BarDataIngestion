CONSTITUTIONAL LAW
QUESTIONS

2. If Quail is able to file the case in federal
court rather than in state court, on which
constitutional clause will he rely?

Questions 1 — 4 are based on the
following facts:

Junior attends Riverdale Public High School.
Riverdale is an affluent community, and
the Riverdale High School is known for
its innovative course offerings. Among the
Riverdale courses are Eastern Philosophy,
Comparative Religion and Comparative
Philosophy. In order to facilitate understand-
ing between all people and to integrate the
Riverdale offerings into all aspects of the
school, each year an official of one of the
world's major religions or philosophies is
asked to lead a prayer/affirmation before the
season's first football game. Quail, a would-
be law student, enrolled in Riverdale's pre-
law program, files suit to enjoin an Islamic
monk from offering a benediction at the
opening football game this year.

1. If Quail files the suit against the state,
on what constitutional clause will he
rely?

A. First Amendment Freedom of

Religion.

B. First Amendment Freedom of

Speech.

C. Fourteenth Amendment Due

Process.

D. None of the above.

3. Will Quail's state suit prevail?

A. Yes, because the prayer exces-
sively entangles a religion with
public schooling.

B. Yes, because Quail's own reli-
gion is being interfered with.

C. No, because all religions are be-

ing treated equally.

D. No, because Quail's claim is not

in earnest.

A. First Amendment Non-Establish-

ment of Religion.

B. First Amendment Freedom of

Speech.

C. Fourteenth Amendment Due

Process.

D. None of the above.

4. Assume for this question only, that it
is not Riverdale high which offers the
benediction, but is instead the River-
dale School Board which offers such,
before their weekly meetings (where
no students are present). Which of the
following propositions are correct?

I. The First Amendment is

irrelevant. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 153

II. There may be fewer First
Amendment protections
than in Question 1.

III. The purpose of the prayer
needs to be discerned.

A. I only.

B. II and III only.

C. II only.

D. III only.

Questions 5 —10 are based on the
following facts:

The state of Columbia has made it a misde-
meanor for anyone to solicit voters within
75 feet of a polling place during election
day hours. Supporters of Libertarian Party
Presidential candidate, Andre Marrou, frus-
trated at the lack of media coverage given
their candidate and believing the public
would embrace their platform — but for the
governmental hassling — approach voters
within 50 feet of the polls on election day.
Their approach is moderate. Libertarian Don
Baggle approaches people entering the polls,
with the following soliloquy: "Hi. My name
is Don. Would you like to know what the
Libertarians stand for?" If the response is
positive, Don gives a five-minute descrip-
tion. If the response is negative, Don offers
a flyer.

Undercover officer, Wil Marsh, arrests Don
while he is in the process of offering a pam-
phlet. Subsequent to the arrest, one ounce of
marijuana is found on Don's person.

5. If Don challenges his misdemeanor ar-
rest, for soliciting voters within 75 feet,
on what constitutional clause or clauses
will he rely?

A. First Amendment Freedom of

Religion.

B. Fifth Amendment Due Process.

C. First Amendment Freedom of

Speech.

D. None of the above.  

154 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

6. If Don's claim is heard, it will be be-
cause which of the following threshold
requirements have been met?

I. Standing.

II. Ripeness.

III. Mootness.

IV. Don is a U.S. Citizen.

A. II only.

B. II and IV only.

C. I, II, III and IV.

D. I and II only.

7. Provided that Don's claim of a constitu-
tional violation is heard, which standard
of review will be utilized?

A. Strict scrutiny.

B. Reasonable basis.

C. The Intermediate Standard.

D. None of the above.

8. Will Don's claim prove to be success-

ful?

A. Yes, because the state had a ra-

tional basis.

C. No, because there was no rational

basis.

D. No, because there was a compel-

ling state interest.

9. Assume for this question only, that
although the state has had this law
on the books for 50 years, they have
never enforced it — although several
individuals have violated it. In order to
attempt to gain more political coverage
for the Libertarians, Don sues the state
to have the law overturned. If this suit
is dismissed, what will be the likely
reason?

A. Mootness.

B. Bad faith of Don.

C. Ripeness.

D. Independent state grounds.

10. Assume for this question only, that the
Columbia law is deemed unconstitu-
tional, can Don be prosecuted for the
drug possession?

A. Yes, because they are entirely

different laws.

B. Yes, because of the Drug Ex-
ception to the Warrant require-
ment.

C. Yes, because the arrest was le-

B. Yes, because there was no corn- 	

gal.

D. No.	

11. With the state of present technology,
the manufacture of nuclear-based en-
ergy has an unfortunate side-effect
— the production of unusable and toxic
nuclear waste. Because of the world
and nation's dwindling supply of oil,
the state of X has encouraged in-state
business to embark on the production of
nuclear energy. In order to give this en-
couragement "teeth," a 20% discount is
given to in-state corporations regarding
the disposal of their nuclear waste.

State X, itself, owns all of the nuclear-
disposal plants. (With that policy, it
ensures competent disposal).

Y Corp, a corporation in State Y (a state
bordering State X) is in the business of
producing nuclear energy. Much of the
energy it produces is sold to the citizens
and businesses in State X.

If Y Corp challenges State X for not
giving it a 20% discount on disposal,
its challenge will:

A. Prevail, because of the Com-

merce Clause.

B. Prevail, because of the Due Pro-

cess Clause.

C. Prevail, because of the Equal

Protection Clause.

D. Fail, because of the sovereignty

of state regulation.

156 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

Questions 12 —14 are based on the
following facts:

The city of Simmee is predominantly Cauca-
sian, middle-class and blue-collar. Because
of a recent jury trial verdict which was un-
popular with minority communities, Simmee
became a very popular spot for non-violent
civil rights demonstrations. The Simmee
Board of Directors, acting at the direction of
Simmee's Mayor Ringer passed an ordinance
requiring all of those who wish to parade or
demonstrate to apply for a permit and pay
a fee based on the approximate cost to the
city (regarding extra police, clean-up, etc.).
The Simmee ordinance directed the Board to
make an accurate tabulation of such.

Free Freedom Lovers (FFL), a group with
socialist learnings, applied for a permit to the
Simmee Board. The permit was granted, but
a $500 fee "to cover costs" was levied. FFL
never had their demonstration, but instead
requested a state court to restrain and enjoin
the Simmee procedure.

12. On what basis is the FFL suit most likely

based?

A. Freedom of Association.

B. Freedom of Speech.

C. Equal Protection.

D. Due Process.

13. Which of the following propositions are

true?  

I. The Simmee licensing	
	procedure was a prior

II. The Simmee licensing
	procedure was a reason-
able time, place and man-
ner restriction.

	III. The city's procedure was

not "state action."

A. I only.

B. II only.

C. III only.

D. II and III only.

14. If the Simmee procedure is declared
unconstitutional, it will be because of
which of the following reasons:

I.

It was not narrowly tai-
lored to meet the city's
interest.

II. It vested too much power

in the Board.

A. I and II only.

B.

I only.

C. II only.

The city of Dickens, because of its many,
naturally-occurring rivers, is always build-
ing bridges. Unfortunately, the city fails to
either train or warn its employees about the
dangers of this job. Bill Richards is on the
city payroll and dies in a bridge-related ac-
cident. Bill's widow, Sharon, sues the city
based on §1983 U.S. Code.

15. For a § 1983 claim to succeed, there

must be:

A. A tort on the part of the city.

B. A crime on the part of the city.

C. A violation of constitutional

rights by the city.

D. None of the above.

16. If Sharon claims that Bill's substantive
due process rights were abridged, her
suit will:

A. Prevail, because of the negli-

gence of the city.

B. Prevail, because there was a

§ 1983 tort.

C. Fail, because the city was not

negligent.

D. Neither I nor II.

D. None of the above.

17. The fictional state of Perotia has pro-
hibited all waste-disposal businesses in
the state from accepting waste products
produced out of the state. There is no
evidence that the refused waste is toxic.
Bushco, a waste-disposal business in
Perotia, challenges the Perotia regula-
tion. Will Bushco prevail?

A. No, because a state can refuse to

allow pollution.

B. Yes, because of the Commerce

Clause.

C. No, because this does not appear
to be economically-based.

D. None of the above.

158 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

Questions 18 — 25 are based on the
following facts:

John Wayne Airport, of Orange County Cali-
fornia, has just adopted a law, by the power
of the Orange County Port Authority, ban-
ning the solicitation of funds, the distribution
of literature, or the sale of written material
within the common areas of its airport.

The National Rifle Association (NRA),
angered by the rising tide of gun regulation
has targeted the Wayne Airport as a forum to
make their case that the Second Amendment
is losing its all-important meaning.

NRA volunteer Duke Hinkins hands out a
free small cactus inside the common areas of
the Wayne Airport. Then he asks for a small
contribution to "defray the costs of growing
and potting the cacti." Duke also offers to
sell two small books. One is on the Old West
and the other is on President Jefferson's
views on the Second Amendment. If the air
traveler is either unresponsive or if, at the
outset, the air traveler seems hurried, Duke
simply and only offers a free colorful flyer
entitled, "GUNS ARE FREEDOM."

On July 4, Duke is arrested by Officer Bart;
after offering Bart the cactus and asking
for a donation. Undeterred and back at the
airport, On July 6, Duke is again arrested,
but this time by Officer Cary, for attempting
to sell her the two books. On July 8, Duke
is back at the airport, and is again arrested,
but this time by Officer Darby, for offer-
ing her the free pamphlet. A few days later
Duke, through his lawyers, seeks to enjoin
the prohibition.

Questions 26 — 27 are based on the 	
following facts: 	

26. On what grounds will they most likely

base this challenge?

The year is 1999 and the U.S. has turned to
the use of nuclear energy, due to the dwin-
dling supply of its own oil, the Arab Oil
Embargo of 1996, and the development of
nuclear fusion energy (which produces only
low level nuclear waste).

However, many of the states have set up
barriers to the disposal of low level nuclear
waste in their state.

The effect of this state action is to create
a crisis situation regarding disposal of this
waste.

After much debate Congress has reacted to
the problem by enacting the Comprehensive
Waste Disposal Act of 1999. There are three
clauses:

1) States will receive federal mon-
etary incentives for providing for
such disposal;

2) States providing for such dis-
posal can surcharge states which
do not; and

3) If there are no waste programs
developed, states must take title
to their own waste and must pay
all "damages" if they do not take
title to their own waste.

The state of North California has challenged
the constitutionality of the Act.

A. Commerce Clause.

B. Tenth Amendment.

C. Ninth Amendment.

D. Just Compensation.

27. Will the North California challenge

succeed?

A. Yes, as to all clauses of the Act.

B. Yes, as to clauses 1 and 2, only

of the Act.

C. Yes, as to clause 3, only, of the

Act.

Questions 28 — 30 are based on the
following facts:

A. Yes, because the Au Natural
Party was treated unfairly.

The fictional state of Island requires, for
a new political party to be placed on the
electoral ballot, a showing of "significant"
public support. This has been interpreted
by the Island Supreme Court to require for
state-wide election either petitions signed
by no more than 1% of the voters, or a 5%
showing in a previous election.

The Island city of Corruptia, however, has
a more stringent requirement — 5% of the
eligible voters must sign a petition prior to
a party being placed on the ballot. The "Au
Natural" Party has met the state require-
ments and desires to run a candidate for
Mayor of Corruptia. However, the Corruptia
City Council has refused to allow Bob Nor-
ris ballot access — since he has not met their
requirements.

28. If Norris appeals to the Island State
Supreme Court, should he prevail?

B. Yes, because there is a "case or

controversy."

C. No, because the issue is moot.

D. None of the above.

30. Assume for this question only, that the
U.S. Supreme Court has accepted re-
view of Norris' case on the question of
the constitutionality of the Island ballot
access rules. Will he prevail?

A. Yes, if the state cannot prove that
the rules on new political parties
are necessary to serve a compel-
ling government interest.

B. Yes, if the state can show that the
rules on new political parties are
rationally related to a permissible
government interest.

Questions 31 — 36 are based on the
following facts:

The fictional state of Northeast, based on a
conservative swing in their citizens' poli-
tics, has enacted a comprehensive Abortion
Control Act. The Act is comprised of the
following clauses:

1) An abortion is generally not to
be allowed when the fetus is vi-
able.

2) A woman must receive informa-
tion at least 24 hours prior to the
abortion regarding alternatives to
abortion, including adoption.

3) A woman must give informed
consent to the abortion 24 hours
prior to the abortion, unless her
health is imminently in danger.

4) A married woman must furnish
proof at least 24 hours prior to
the abortion that her husband has
been informed.

5) An unmarried minor must ei-
ther furnish proof of one of her
parent's consent to the abortion,
or judicial-approval of her abor-
tion.

6) Those medical personnel and
clinics performing abortions
must keep records indicating
that clauses 1-5, above, were
complied with.

Abortion Clinic XYZ and Mary Coe chal-
lenge the Act. The Act is upheld by the
Northeast State Supreme Court. The appeal
is now pending before the federal courts.

31. Will Clause 1 be upheld?

A. Yes, because of Roe v. Wade.

B. Yes, because it has now been
held that a fetus is a human be-
ing.

C. No, because of the Right to

Life.

D. Yes, but for none of the above

reasons.

32. Will Clause 2 be upheld?

A. No, because it is a pre-viability
regulation contrary to Roe v.
Wade.

B. No, because abortion is a funda-

mental privacy right.

C. Yes, because a state is permitted
to regulate abortion, provided
the state does not entirely outlaw
it.

D. Yes, because the regulation does
not place an undue burden on the
right to abortion.

Questions 38 — 39 are based on the
following facts:

Late one evening Skin, a teenager, and two
of his friends trespassed onto the front yard
of Omar, a refugee from Iraq. Omar now
lives in the fictional state of Clintonia. Skin
built a Cross and burned it in Omar's yard.
Skin's two friends escaped, but Skin was
apprehended. As Skin was apprehended and
Omar watched, Skin yelled to Omar, "I'll kill
you, you bloody Arab, if you stay here!"

Skin is prosecuted in Clintonia, under their
new "Hate Crime Law." The law, in pertinent
part, reads as follows:

"It is a class 1 misdemeanor, to burn a cross,
display a swastika or state any racial epithet
for the purpose of expressing racial or ethnic
hatred in a public place or on private prop-
erty which is not in the lawful possession of
the suspect."

38. Will Skin's burning of the Cross on
Omar's lawn suffice to find him guilty
under the Clintonia Hate Crime Law?

A. Yes, because all of the elements
of the crime appear to have been
met.

B. Yes, because Skin's acts were
constitutionally unprotected.

C. No, because there was no mens

rea in the crime.

D. No, because the law was over-

broad.

39. Will Skin's post-arrest threat to Omar
suffice to find him guilty under the
Clintonia Hate Crime Law?

A. Yes, because all of the elements
of the crime appear to have been
met.

B. Yes, because these were fighting

words.

C. No, because there was no mens

rea in the crime.

D. No, because the law was facially

unconstitutional.

§208:

1) An individual is permitted to
write about his/her life. But if
the writing describes crimes
for which the individual has
been convicted; or crimes for
which the individual is formally
charged; or crimes which the in-
dividual admits to, but for which
he/she has not been formally
charged, all proceeds, profits and
royalties shall be turned over to
the Bronsonia Victim's Fund.

2) A publisher, co-author or lawyer
who participates in the publish-
ing of material delineated in
Clause 1, above, must furnish
all proceeds, profits and royalties
which would have been payable
to the author directly to the Bron-
sonia Victim's Fund.

3) Violation of either Clause 1 or
2 shall be punished as a Class 3
misdemeanor and violators shall
be fined $100,000 in addition to
the amount of profits, proceeds
or royalties not furnished to the
Bronsonia Victim's Fund.

40. Famed football star, Mike Toggle, was
convicted of rape in Bronsonia. In order
to set the record straight, he contracted
with Violence Press to write a book. In
the book, Toggle denied having raped
the victim, although he did admit to rap-
ing a female when he was 16-years-old.
Toggle brought up this point to indicate
how guilty he felt at that time and,
thus, why he would never commit this
crime. Violence Press paid Toggle an
advance of $5,000 and, to date, $2,333
in royalties. Which of the following
propositions are true?

I. Violence Press violated

§208.2.

II. Toggle violated §208.1.

A. I only.

B. II only.

C. I and II.

D. Neither I nor II.

41. Rotty has been convicted of several
"contract killings." Famed writer Jack
Junkins decides to write his story. He
interviews Rotty over a period of two
months. If Bronsonia prosecutes Junk-
ins under §208, they will:

A. Succeed, because he profited

from crime.

B. Succeed, because he wrote about

crime. 

C. Succeed, because he profited

from another's crime.

D. Fail, because Junkins was only

morally guilty.

42. Which of the following propositions are

true?

I. The Bronsonia statute is
unconstitutional since it
is not narrowly tailored
to further a compelling
state interest.

II. The Bronsonia statute is
unconstitutional since it
is overbroad.

III. The Bronsonia statute is
a kind of prior restraint
on the press and speech.

A. I, II and III only.

B. I and II only.

D. None of the above.

43. Due to migration to the Southern and
Western states, the fictional state of
Northwest has experienced a marked
decrease in population — particularly as
compared to the growth of population
in the Southern and Western states. In
order to facilitate proportional represen-
tation in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, Congress has increased the seats
available in these states, and decreased
the seats in Northwest, but not beyond
that accounted for by increased or de-
creased population. If Northwest chal-
lenges this reduction, it will:

A. Succeed, since states must be
given equal representation.

B. Fail, because states must be
given equal representation.

C. Fail, because the facts seem to
indicate an equal apportionment
method was used.

D. None of the above.

45. If Elizabethia's school administrators
are presently found to be in good faith,
are the U.S. Supreme Court and its
lower federal courts discharged from
supervising desegregation?

A. Yes, provided admission policies

are race-neutral.

B. Yes, because there is no more
that can be accomplished.

C. Yes, because of state's rights.

D. No.

Questions 44 — 45 are based on the
following facts: 

The year is 1993. As of 1954, in the land-
mark decision of Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation, 347 U.S. 483, the fictional state of
Elizabethia has had its primary, secondary
and post-secondary schools under the super-
vision of the local Federal District Court.
The supervision was based on Elizabethia's
former pattern of de jure segregation. In
that era, Elizabethia assigned students to
school solely depending on the race of the
student. As of 1993, all enrollments are open
at all schools. However, of the five state-run
universities, three remain overwhelmingly
Caucasian and two remain overwhelmingly
of African-descent.

44. Federal jurisdiction was established
in Brown v. Board of Education under
which of the following reasons and/or
theories:

I. Separate but equal
schools segregated by
race, are inherently un-
equal.

II. Privileges and Immuni-

III. Equal Protection viola-

tion.

IV. Due Process violation.

A. I and II only.

B. I and III only.

Questions 46 — 48 are based on the
following facts:

The city of Marblestone, in the fictional state
of Alfredia, has enacted a rent-control ordi-
nance. The ordinance is specifically aimed
at controlling the rent in mobile home parks.
The policy of the rent control ordinance
is to protect the lower-middle classes and
elderly — who are the most frequent tenants
of the parks. The ordinance at issue not only

Questions 54 — 58 are based on the
following facts:

Jessica Rabindra purports to follow an an-
cient Delphic Religion, which she, herself,
in psychic trance, has rediscovered. The
religion follows the so-called "goddess"
perception of cosmic reality. She has formed
a church called, "The Church of the Astral
Goddess." The Church is located on a one-
acre secluded ranch in the fictional state of
North Californ.

Membership in the Church is voluntary. But
each member, to be admitted, undergoes a
series of purification rites wherein the mem-
ber is purged of a chauvinistic view of the
world and is "put in touch with the power
of the earth's creative energy." Among the
aspects of the purification are an abstinence
from eating animal flesh, one day of fasting
per week and a voluntary sexual ritual with
Jessica.

The sexual ritual with Jessica, for males, in-
volves the performance of sexual intercourse
and cunnilingus with her. The sexual ritual
for females includes only the performance
of cunnilingus with her.

Jessica has written a book about her religion,
and this book has attracted many people to
join her church. Church dues are $400 per
month.

In the state of North Californ, the following
provisions are present in their penal code: 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 171

Q

§ 1111: It is a misdemeanor to offer
sexual intercourse or non-
intercourse sexual relations
for hire.

tion.

§1114: Cunnilingus and fellatio
are misdemeanors.

§2009: Solicitation occurs when
one person induces another
to participate in a crime,
intending that this person
so participate.

54. If Jessica is charged under § 1111, and
offers a First Amendment Freedom of
Religion defense, she will most likely:

A. Succeed, because she was exer-

cising a religion.

B. Fail, because the Freedom of
Religion does not protect against
prosecution for prostitution.

C. Succeed, because the adults con-

sented.

D. Fail, because her religion was

bogus.

55. Jessica's best argument against a pros-

ecution under § 1112 is:

172 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

A. There were other activities of the
church besides sex and the pay-
ment of money was not required
to have sex with Jessica.

B. She was the only priestess.

C. Other activities occurred in her

temple.

D. She was exercising the Freedom

of Religion.

56. If Jessica is prosecuted for a violation

of § 1114, her prosecution will likely:

A. Succeed, because there is no
right to extra-marital sexual pri-
vacy.

B. Fail, because the acts were pri-

vate and consensual.

C. Fail, because this crime does not

include sex-for-hire.

D. Fail, because there was no genital

penetration.

57. If Jessica is prosecuted for a violation
of §2009, based on the inducement to
join her church in her book, her best
defense will be:

A. Freedom of Religion.

B. Freedom of Speech.

C. The penumbra right to privacy.

D. Freedom of Association. 

58. If Jessica is prosecuted for initiating her	
own husband into the religion, under

63. Grade school student, Jeremiah, refuses
to salute the flag in his second grade
class. He is disciplined by his teacher,
Ms. Thomas; and sent to the principal,
Dr. Rehnquist, to serve 2 hours of deten-
tion. He had refused to salute the flag
based on his upbringing as a Jehovah's
Witness, that one's allegiance is owed
only to God. His mother, who happens
to be a lawyer, sues the school board,
seeking an injunction of forced flag-
saluting and also seeking unspecified
damages. Will Jeremiah's suit pre-
vail?

A. No, because this was not truly
prejudicial to his religion.

B. No, because the Constitution
protects family values, such as
saluting the flag.

C. Yes, because the Constitution
protects family values such as
a person's right not to be forced
to appear to support state-spon-
sored orthodoxy.

D. Yes, because the teaching of the
Jehovah's Witnesses was essen-
tially correct.

Q

Questions 61— 62 are based on the
following facts:

The fictional state of Rightwing has changed
the motto on their license plates to "JUST
SAY NO." Ted Paine is offended by this
since he believes it is contrary to the prin-
ciples of his Asian religion to demand others
behave in a certain way. So, Ted alters his
plate to read "JUST SAY NOT." The Righ-
twing State Police arrested Ted for defacing
public property (since the plates technically
belong to the state). Ted is convicted.

B. First Amendment Freedom of

Religion.

C. No, because he could still as-
sociate with members of his
religion.

D. None of the above.

Questions 64 — 65 are based on the
following facts:

The agrarian, back-to-nature sect called the
Followers of Landrew, believe that a child,
as of age 14, should not go to public school
and should begin to work the fields as part of
their farm life. Archon, the parent of Jedidiah
(who is 14) takes him out of the local public
junior high school. However, the school
district has a rule that children must attend
school until their sixteenth birthday.

64. Archon is ordered to re-enroll Jedidiah
in school, and is threatened with con-
tempt of court if he does not. If Archon
challenges this order, he will:

I. Prevail, because of the
parental right of priva-
cy.

II. Prevail, because, in ef-
fect, the district was
violating the Establish-
ment Clause of the First
Amendment.

III. Prevail, because the
school district was vio-
lating the Free Exer-
cise Clause of the First
Amendment.

A. I and II only.

A. Fail, because it is Jedidiah who

B. II and III only.

will lose out.

B. Succeed, based on the Free Ex-
ercise Clause and Privacy.

C. Fail, because there is a compel-
ling interest in the education of
minors.

D. Succeed, because the school

district lacks jurisdiction.

65. Assume for this question only, that in
response to the practice of the school
district, the Followers of Landrew form
their own private school, which teaches
the basics. If the school district enacts
a new rule to the effect that all students
must attend public school until the age
of 18 and the Followers of Landrew
challenge this, the Followers of Lan-
drew will:

C. I and III only.

D. I, II and III.

66. The religion of Funkamental, now
established for 50 years, has fallen on
hard times. In the eyes of Ron, Hub,
the present president, has allowed the
assets and membership of the religion to
drastically fall. But Hub will not give up
his presidency. So, Ron files suit in the
state court to order Hub to stand for a
democrat election. Will Ron prevail?

A. No, because of the Free Exercise

Clause.

B. No, because of the Establishment

Clause. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 175

C. No, because there is no case or	

controversy.	

Questions 67 — 71 are based on the
following facts:

D. Yes, if the facts establish Ron's

claim to be true.

The city of Puritania in the fictional state
of Hypocritia, troubled by the decay in the
moral fabric of its society, has enacted a
statute barring nudity in places open to the
public. The statute punishes such as a misde-
meanor. Nudity is defined as the "exposure
of female or male genitalia or the exposure
of female nipples or areola, when such is
done for the purpose of appealing to the
prurient interest."

67. On its face, is the Puritania statute un-

constitutional?

A. Yes, because there can be sym-
bolic speech aspects to both male
and female nudity.

B. Yes, because it is overbroad.

C. Yes, because it is vague.

D. None of the above.

68. The "Go For It" Bar, open only to those
over the age of 21, has a stage where
women dance topless. One evening the
owner, Paddy, and the offending fe-
males are arrested by the police. If they
appeal their conviction, they will:

A. Fail, because the Puritania law is

overbroad.

B. Succeed, because the Puritania

law is overbroad. 

176 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

C. Fail, because their conduct is
constitutionally unprotected.

C. Be convicted, because her acts

were in public.

D. Succeed, because the conduct

was symbolic speech.

D. Not be convicted, her conduct
was not lewd and lascivious.

69. One afternoon, Murphy Moe is arrested
for breast-feeding her infant child in a
frequented public park. Murphy hap-
pens to be a very beautiful woman. Her
act of breast-feeding included exposure
of her areola and one breast or the
other (while switching her baby from
breast-to-breast). Murphy was wearing
a button down shear blouse, and tightly-
fitting, high-cut shorts. A group of men
would frequently, in a clandestine way,
watch Murphy each afternoon during
their lunch break.

After her arrest, and after being given
proper Miranda warnings, Murphy ad-
mits that she knew several men were
watching her. She also admits that she
knew her actions were likely to sexually
arouse some of the men — that in fact,
she wanted, "to show men the beauties
of having babies and because I was
hoping to meet a new man." If Murphy
is prosecuted under the Puritania law,
she will likely:

A. Not be convicted, because the
elements of the crime have not
been met.

B. Be convicted, even though she
might claim her act was sym-
bolic speech.

70. Chipmunks, a club catering to adult fe-
males, offers erotic dancing by men. In
the dances, the men do a "strip tease", in
which they remove all of their clothing
but for a tight bikini-type bottom. The
brief is so tight that outlines of the male
genitalia are visible. In fact, many of the
men who work at Chipmunks arrange
"dates" with the customers after hours,
during which they perform sex for hire
contrary to another prostitution law of
Puritania.

The police are aware of the prostitu-
tion, but are unable to find any females
who are willing to testify against the
men. Thus, Chipmunks, and several
of the male dancers, are prosecuted
under the Puritania indecent exposure
statute, above. Will the prosecution be
successful?

A. Yes, because they were guilty of

prostitution.

B. Yes, because Chipmunks was
clearly contrary to Puritania's
community standards.

C. No, because the prostitution

could not be proven. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 177

72. The fictional state of South Kaliforn has
pictured on its flag a western gunslinger.
Because Duke finds not only guns, but
the whole gunslinger mentality patently
offensive, he calls a press conference
and publicly burns the South Kaliforn
flag. In South Kaliforn, it is a misde-
meanor to: "Purposely burn, destroy,
mutilate, defile, desecrate or dirty the
state or federal flag." Duke is pros-
ecuted and convicted in South Kaliforn.
Will his federal appeal succeed?

A. Yes, because the crime was strict
liability and, thus, overbroad.

B. Yes, because the state infringed
his First Amendment rights.

C. No, because the flag he burned

was a state flag.

D. None of the above.

73. The year is 2017, and you may assume
U.S. Constitutional law has remained
the same as it is at present — with one
notable exception. The U.S. Constitu-
tion has been amended to place an
outright and complete ban on the use of
alcohol, with the only exception being
for prescription drugs.

Father 0' Scalia, a Catholic Priest living
in Illinois, is prosecuted for using wine
during the Sacrament at his Church. If
he challenges the law based on First
Amendment grounds, he will: 

D. No, because there was no genital
"exposure" as under the relevant
Puritania statute.

71. Darby is a young woman out of work in
Puritania. She was an aerobics instruc-
tor at one of the city's health clubs;
but due to the recession the club has
closed down. So, Darby takes out a
vendor's license to sell hot dogs in one
of Puritania's open air malls. Unlike the
other vendors, however, Darby wears a
thong bikini. She is arrested for violat-
ing the Puritania statute. Will Darby's
First Amendment "symbolic speech"
argument succeed?

A. Yes, because she was doing noth-

ing unlawful.

B. Yes, because her sales approach
had artistic First Amendment
content.

C. No, because there was no speech
content to her acts or to the city's
prosecution of her.

D. No, because she was guilty of the

crime.

178 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

A. Succeed, because of the Free

Exercise Clause.

Questions 74 — 75 are based on the
following facts:

B. Succeed, because there is no

compelling state interest.

C. Succeed, because of the Freedom

of Association Clause.

D. Fail.

Sick and tired of the poor quality of ap-
pointees to the U.S. Supreme Court, both
houses of Congress pass a law whereby the
power to appoint U.S. Supreme Court judges

Questions 76 — 77 are based on the
following facts:

During a senate debate, U.S. Senator Tom

defamation, his best defense will be:

A. First Amendment Freedom of

Speech.

B. Article I Speech and Debate

77. Assume for this question only, that it
can be proven that Semand received a
$20,000 bribe from ABC University, the
competitor of XYZ University, for the
$150,000 grant. May Semand be sued
for taking a bribe in connection with the
federal grant application?

A. No, since there was sovereign

ers.

B. Fail, because the President's
power is limited to pardon for
political crimes.

B. Ripeness Doctrine.

C. Commercial Speech Doctrine.

D. Just Compensation Clause.

The fictional County of Lemon, in the fic-
tional state of Reagonia, has been plagued
by a series of advertisements from certain
segments of the garment industry. The ads
purport to offer the lowest prices. The ads
indicate that the prices are so low because
the goods are imported and "Not Made in
America." Incensed by the ads, Lemon
County makes it a misdemeanor to advertise
clothing in the state.

school. Junior again burns a U.S. flag.
What is Junior's best argument in ap-
pealing this suspension?

A. Procedural due process.

B. Substantive due process.

C. First Amendment.

D. None of the above.

Questions 92 — 94 are based on the
following facts:

Junior attends Jalonia Junior High School
in the fictional city of Jalonia, a city in the
fictional state of Prisonia. Junior is a po-
litical activist. Having kept up on the latest
and most important United States Supreme
Court pronouncements, Junior realizes it is
his constitutional right to burn a U.S. flag in
political protest. Attempting to exercise this
right, Junior burns the Jalonia Junior High
School's U.S. flag, in the main auditorium
of the junior high school, in the middle of
the entering class's ceremony.

92. If Junior is summarily suspended for
one month from Jalonia Junior High
School, his constitutional rights have
been:

A. Denied, because he was not

given a prior hearing.

B. Denied, because flag-burning is

a right.

C. Not denied, because it was not a

specific political protest.

D. Not denied, because it was like
shouting "Fire!" in a crowded
theatre.

93. Can Junior be criminally punished for

this act of flag-burning?

I. Yes, if he was punished
because it was not his
flag. 

186 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

95. Intent on restoring family values, the
state of Alabama has just enacted a
statute whereby illegitimate children
cannot sue in tort for the wrongful death
of their parents. Is this a lawful state
regulation?

A. Yes, because of the Tenth Amend-

ment.

B. Yes, because Alabama has a
permissible interest in so legis-
lating.

C. Yes, because Alabama has a ra-
tional basis in so legislating.

D. None of the above.

96. The fictional state of Columbia, pre-
cludes all individuals who are color
blind and dyslexic from working as
technicians in the state's nuclear power
plant because of safety concerns. It
has been shown that many of these
individuals are capable of performing
the technical work required. Never-
theless, they are precluded. One such
individual, Hal Sims, sues based on a
denial of Fourteenth Amendment Equal
Protection. Will Hal's suit prevail?

A. Yes, if he could perform the re-

quired work.

B. Yes, because in this case there
was no compelling state inter-
est.

C. Yes, because there was no

rational basis.

D. No, because there was a rational

basis.

97. The state of Hawaii legislature, still
angered at the gross inequities placed
on the many by the few old landown-
ers before the state made that conduct
illegal, pronounces a list of the twenty
worst offenders. It also fines them
$25,000 each and declares them guilty
of a "misdemeanor against the People
of the State of Hawaii." They are not
sentenced, however, to any time in jail.
Under which of the following consti-
tutional clauses will these individuals
have a successful claim?

I.

Just Compensation.

II. Fifth Amendment Due

Process.

III. The Bills of Attainder

Clause.

IV. The Ex Post Facto

Clause.

A. I, II, III and IV.

B. III and IV only.

C. II only.

D. None of the above, since no jail

time was imposed. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 187

98. Fictional President George, after a
highly difficult, but successful, re-elec-
tion campaign, feeling duly grateful to
his Chief of Staff Snaker, bestows upon
him the title of "Royal Knight." The
title has no significance whatsoever,
but there is an official ceremony at the
White House. Ned Rader challenges
this gesture in federal court. Will Rader
succeed?

A. No, because the title has no sig-

nificance.

B. Yes, because it is a title of Nobil-

ity.

C. No, because it is analogous to a

Presidential Medal.

D. No, because Rader has no stand-

ing.

188 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

Questions 99 — 100 are based on
the following facts:

Rawson is sentenced to death at the capital-
sentencing phase of his murder prosecution.
Over objection of the defense, the jury is
told that Rawson is a member of a white
supremacist group. Rawson is sentenced to
death and appeals the conviction based on
the prosecutor's allusion to his membership
in the white supremacist group.

99. What will Rawson's best constitutional

argument be?

A. That he is being subjected to
Cruel and Unusual Punishment.

B. That his Freedom of Association

Rights were abridged.

C. That his Free Speech rights were

abridged.

D. None of the above.

100. If Rawson's white supremacist group
did not advocate disobedience to the
law, and if both Rawson and the victim
are white, will Rawson prevail?

A. No, because Victim Impact state-

ments are admissible.

B. No, because the error was harm-

less.

C. No, because it was relevant.

D. Yes, because it was irrelevant. 

101. A story is written about movie star
Birdie Jones, in the tabloid, the Nation-
al Perspirer. In the story, it is revealed
that Birdie is infected with genital
herpes. If Jones sues the newspaper in
tort for defamation, she will:

A. Prevail, because such is damag-

ing.

B. Prevail, if the story was know-

ingly false.

C. Prevail, since she has a right to

privacy.

D. Fail, because she does not have

a right to privacy.

ND OF QUESTIONS 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 189

190 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW
ANSWERS 

1. A is the correct answer. Junior's claim is
one of the Establishment of Religion in
violation of First Amendment. B is in-
correct because it is not a Speech claim.
It is true that First Amendment claims
against a state entity are made applica-
ble against the state by the incorporation
of some of the Bill of Rights under the
Fourteenth Amendment. However, the
true basis of his claim is the Religion
Clause of the First Amendment, so A is
better than C. D is not correct because
A is correct.

2. Question 2 differs from question one
in that Junior files his case in federal
court rather than state court. However,
this difference makes no difference to
the question. The correct answer is A
for the answer given in #1 above.

3. A is the correct answer. The test of Lem-
on v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1970)
is controlling. To not violate the Estab-
lishment Clause, a state practice must
have a secular purpose, a religiously
neutral effect and must not entangle a
religion with the government. Under a
similar fact pattern in Lee v. Weisman,
112 S.Ct. 2649 (1992), a benediction
by a rabbi before a school graduation
was held violative of the Clause. B
is incorrect because no facts indicate
Quail was forbidden to practice his own
religion. Choice C requires a more dif-
ficult analysis. Although it reasonably
appears that all recognized religions are
being treated equally, non-recognized
religions and atheism are not. More fun-
damentally, as Justice Kennedy, in Lee 
v. Weisman, supra, indicated, what be-
gins as a good faith practice in the area
of religion, too often historically ends in
persecution and forced indoctrination.
D is incorrect because the motives for
a person suing are not relevant, the is-
sue is whether he has a good cause of
action. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 191

6. D is the correct answer, since only
bring a constitutionally-based claim, the
individual must have standing. Stand-
ing requires that the individual's own
rights were denied. See, e.g., Simon v. 
Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Or-
ganization, 426 U.S. 26 (1976). Here,
since Don was, in fact, arrested under
this statute, he clearly has standing.
Thus, choice I is correct. Choice II
is correct because this controversy is
"ripe." Ripeness requires that the chal-
lenged statute is either being enforced,
has a real danger of imminently being
enforced, or is dissuading individuals
from pursuing their constitutionally
protected liberties via its existence. See
generally, Epperson v. Arkansas, 393
U.S. 97 (1968). Obviously, since Don
is actually being prosecuted under the
statute, the controversy is ripe. Choice
III is incorrect for the same reason that
choice II is correct. Had Don not been
arrested and had the statute been anti-
quated and never enforced, there would
be a problem of mootness. But that was
not at all the situation here. Choice IV
is incorrect because although aliens do
not enjoy all of the rights of citizens,
they do enjoy many, if not most of the
constitutional freedoms in this country.
See generally, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118
U.S. 356 (1886).  

A

O

O

4. B is the correct answer because only
I is incorrect because whenever a state
sponsors religious activity, the Estab-
lishment Clause of the First Amend-
ment is implicated. (This Clause may
not require suspension of the activity,
but it is implicated.) Choice II is cor-
rect because significantly less First
Amendment protection is given when
it is adults, not school children, who
are subjected to the prayer/benediction.
See Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783
(1983) (where Nebraska's practice of
allowing a prayer before legislative ses-
sion was allowed). Although a school
board meeting is not identical to a leg-
islative session, it is likely that  Marsh
controls. Choice III is correct because
were the purpose of the school board's
prayer to indoctrinate school commit-
tee members, then there would be an
Establishment Clause violation.

5. C is the correct answer. Don was at-
tempting to influence the marketplace
of ideas. Thus, the Free Speech Clause
is implicated. Since political parties are
generally not considered to be religions,
choice A, which cites to the Freedom of
Religion Clause, is incorrect. Choice
B is clearly incorrect because the Fifth
Amendment Due Process Clause is only
federally applicable-and this is a state
case. D is incorrect for the same reason
that C is correct.

192 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

9. C is the correct answer. Constitutional
claims must be ripe. As a general rule, a
statute which has been on the books for
some time, which is openly disobeyed
and which is not enforced indicates
there is no real controversy. Poe v. Ull-
man, 367 U.S. 497 (1961). A is incorrect
because, since the law is still on the
books, the point being challenged has
not been legally settled — therefore, it
is, by definition, not "moot." B is incor-
rect because the motive of the litigant
in bringing a law suit is, generally, of
de minimis importance. D is incorrect
because it misconstrues the meaning
of the Tenth Amendment (Independent
State Grounds Clause). Although a state
is permitted to expand the rights of its
citizens under its own constitution, it is
not permitted to remove rights which
are federally-guaranteed. Free speech
is federally mandated to the states by
way of the Fourteenth Amendment Due
Process Clause. 

7. A is the correct answer. Restrictions
on freedom of speech based on content
are subjected to the most heightened
degree of scrutiny. Because the law is
concerned with the message or content
of Don's speech, a high standard will be
used. Since choices B and C use lesser
standards, they are incorrect. Since A is
correct, obviously D is incorrect.

8. D is the correct answer. Although con-
stitutional claims based on the Freedom
of Speech are strictly scrutinized, and,
thus, the state is required to show a
compelling interest for the restriction
to be in harmony with the Constitu-
tion, because of the particular danger
of intimidation of voters at the polls,
this is one regulation which will satisfy
the difficult Strict Scrutiny test. Histori-
cally, intimidation and fraud at the polls
has been a real and recurrent evil. Thus,
Columbia's statute is constitutional.
In Burson v. Freeman, 112 S.Ct. 1846
(1992) a similar Tennessee statute (re-
quiring a 100 foot distance from the
polls) was upheld. Since the statute was
lawful, and the proper state burden was
a compelling interest, choices A, B and
C are incorrect.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 193

A

O

O

10. D is the correct answer. Although this
question is technically one of Criminal
Procedure, it serves to show the broad
overlap between these two subjects.
Under the Exclusionary Rule of the
Fourth Amendment, if there was unlaw-
ful governmental activity and illegal
evidence is discovered as a result of
that activity, that evidence is generally
to be suppressed. See Wong Sun v. 
United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963). In
the case at hand, it is stipulated that the
law is unconstitutional. Since the arrest
and follow-up search were the fruit of
that, its result (the marijuana) is to be
suppressed. [Please note: although the
statute is, in law, constitutional, it is
"fair game" for a question to make a
stipulation which is ultimately incor-
rect. Therefore, students should avoid
reading questions on an exam and then
using them to go back and change the
answers on questions they have already
answered.] A is incorrect for the same
reasons that D is correct. B is incorrect
because there is no drug exception to
the warrant requirement. C is incorrect
because it disobeys the stipulation in
the call of the question.

11. A is the correct answer. The Com-
merce Clause mandates that a state is
not permitted to restrain the commerce
between itself and sister states. The
Clause essentially precludes economic
protectionism. Since State X's rule fa-
cially discriminated against State Y's
business, it is unconstitutional. The
language of the rule gave a "discount,"
as opposed to tacking on a surcharge,
is of no moment to the substance of
the regulation. See Chemical Waste
Management Inc. v. Hunt, 112 S.Ct.
2009 (1992). Since the Chemical Waste
case, supra, is directly on point, and
uses as its reason, the Commerce Clause
choices B, C and D are incorrect. D is
also incorrect because state sovereignty
falls to the requirements of the Com-
merce Clause.

12. B is the correct answer. The FFL ordi-
nance is a clear example of a facially
invalid ordinance in that it arbitrarily
restricts the freedom of speech. Since
the FFL, itself, was not outlawed, there
is no Freedom of Association claim.
Thus, A is incorrect. Since there are
no facts indicating the Simmee Board
treated other groups better, there is no
Equal Protection claim on these facts
and C is incorrect. Since it was speech
which was implicated, a more specific
claim would be phrased as "Speech,"
not "Due Process" so B is a better
choice than D.  

194 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

13. A is the correct answer because only
choice I is correct. Choice I is correct
because the Simmee Board and Mayor
were restraining the public speech in
advance of its occurrence. This, by defi-
nition, is a prior restraint. Choice II is
factually incorrect. Although a city may
place reasonable time, place and man-
ner restrictions on public speech; this
regulation is unlawful because it placed
too much power in the Board. See
Forsyth County v. Nationalist Move-
ment, 112 S.Ct. 2395 (1992). Choice
III is obviously incorrect because a city
government's regulation is considered
to be state/governmental action; it is the
official action of a government subdivi-
sion.

14. A is the correct answer because choices
I and II are correct. Choice I is correct
because although a city is allowed
to place time/place/manner limits on
public speech, such must be narrowly
tailored. The Simmee Board, in its
unchecked ability to set the cost, did
not utilize such a narrow restriction.
Choice II is correct because one of the
fears underlying the First Amendment
was governmental abuse of power used
to suppress speech. In Simmee, the
Board had too much power. It could
effectively drive out public speech by
setting an oppressively high licensing
fee. Choice III is incorrect because both
I and II are correct, B, C and D are not
correct answers.

15. C is the correct answer. In order for
there to be a § 1983 claim, there must
be a constitutional violation on the part
of the city. It is not enough that the city
committed a tort, choice A. Such tort
may give rise to a successful civil suit,
but not a § 1983 claim. See Collins v. 
Harker Heights, 112 S.Ct. 1061 (1992).
Choice B, although probably correct,
is not as good an answer as choice C.
Although most crimes committed under
the color of governmental authority
will also be violations of constitutional
rights, the true issue is whether there
was a constitutional violation — not
whether there was a crime. Since C is
correct, and since B is arguably correct,
D is incorrect.

16. D is the correct answer. A is incorrect
because mere negligence in the govern-
ing of a city does not in and of itself
create a successful constitutional due
process claim. Collins, supra answer
15, indicated such (on similar facts). B
is incorrect because it begs the ques-
tion. For there to be a successful § 1983
claim, there must be an underlying
constitutional violation. Such is not
indicated here. C is factually incorrect .
The city appears to have been negligent.
Sharon likely has a suit — but her suit
is not properly based on due process
grounds. Since A, B and C are all incor-
rect; D (none of the above) is the correct
answer. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 195

17. B is the correct answer. The effect of
the Perotia regulation was, in fact, eco-
nomic protectionism. Local waste-pro-
ducers are afforded an advantage over
out-of-state waste-producers. Thus, the
Commerce Clause prohibits such. See
Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill v. Michi-
gan Department of Natural Resources,
112 S.Ct. 2019 (1992). Although choice
A offers a correct statement that a state
can prevent pollution, it is incorrect if
the state violates the Constitution in so
doing. C is factually incorrect because
an economic advantage is given to in-
state waste-producers. D is incorrect for
the same reason that B is correct.

A

0

18. B is the correct answer. Duke was
essentially expressing ideas. Thus,
the First Amendment (by way of the
Fourteenth Amendment Due Process
Clause) is most at issue — when it is
his expressions which are being cur-
tailed by the state. Although choice A
is superficially appealing in that Duke
was expressing ideas about the Second
Amendment, in no way were his gun
rights then curtailed. Alternately stated,
the ordinance regulated not only those
expressing ideas about gun rights, but
also those expressing any ideas in the
airport setting. Thus, choice A is incor-
rect. Since Duke was not prevented
from associating with other believers
in the Second Amendment and since
he was free to organize Second Amend-
ment activities elsewhere, his Freedom
of Association rights were not abridged.
C is therefore incorrect. D is obviously
incorrect because in no way did these
facts indicate any restraint on interstate
commerce. If the student chose this
answer, he/she should remember that
previous questions on a multiple choice
exam do not influence the answers to
later questions ! 

196 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

19. D is the correct answer. As set out
in International Society for Krishna
Consciousness v. Lee, 112 S.Ct. 2701
(1992) [hereinafter, ISKC-I], airports
are not considered to be "public forums"
for First Amendment Free Speech pur-
poses. Airports are a new phenomenon
and will not be given the status of, e.g.,
a public park. Since sidewalks outside
the airport are available for exercising
speech rights and due to the hurried
nature of air travel, the most protec-
tive level of expression was held to be
inappropriate. A is incorrect because
the mere fact that the public is allowed
in a place, does not make that place a
"public forum." For obvious example,
the public is allowed within a courtroom
to watch trials, but the courtroom is
not a public forum. B is incorrect for
the same reasons that D is correct. C
is incorrect because some areas which
are privately-owned may become state
actors because of their relationship with
the government. Once they are treated
as state actors and government property,
they may then become public forums.
Moreover, no facts indicated the Wayne
Airport to be privately-owned.

A

20. A is the correct answer. Commercial
solicitation of funds in an airport can
be prohibited. Duke was asking for
money when arrested on July 4. The test
to be used is whether the limitation is
merely reasonable. In ISKC-I, supra, it
was held similar regulation was reason-
able. A compelling interest need not be
shown by the state — since airports are
not public forums. B is incorrect not
only because it misses the key issue (the
solicitation of funds), but also because
we know of no evidence indicating
the danger of small cactus plants. C
is incorrect because no facts indicate
the airport was privately-owned. D is
incorrect for the same reasons that A is
correct.

21. A is the correct answer. On July 6 he
was again attempting to solicit funds
— this time by selling books. Since the
county regulation was reasonable due
to the nature of an airport (it is not a
public forum), such can be prohibited.
See ISKC-I. B is incorrect because
if an individual is in a public forum,
although many will consider him/her
to be a "nuisance," such activity is
nevertheless protected. C is incorrect
because no facts indicate the airport
was privately-owned. D is incorrect
because the First Amendment Free
Speech Clause is subject to reasonable
time, place and manner restrictions. It
is not an absolute. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 197

A

O

cn
O

22. D is the correct answer. On July 8,
Duke was not soliciting funds. He was
giving literature away for free. Thus,
since there was no commercial activ-
ity, there is a heightened First Amend-
ment protection. In short, although it
is reasonable to restrict solicitation of
funds, it is not reasonable to restrict
disseminating literature at airports at
no fee. See Lee v. International Society 
for Krishna Consciousness, 112 S.Ct.
2709 (1992) [hereinafter, ISKC-II]. A
is incorrect because on July 8 he was
not soliciting funds. He was merely
giving away literature. Thus, the facts
distinguish this case from ISKC-I. B is
incorrect because if the U.S. Constitu-
tion enshrines a fundamental right, a
state pattern of abrogating that right
in no way shifts the inquiry to the
defendant regarding his assuming the
risk by continuing in his constitution-
ally-protected activity. If such were the
law, there would be nothing left of the
Bill of Rights — provided a state had
a pattern of disallowing its clauses. C
is incorrect because although a citizen
may have other options in exercising
her constitutional liberties, the state is
not permitted to use such as a defense
in curtailing those liberties.

23. D is the correct answer. As held in
ISKC-I and ISKC-II, airports are not
public forums. Thus, a county can
restrict speech activity there if such
restriction is reasonable in light of the
purposes of the forum and not an at-
tempt to suppress the speaker's view-
point. The stringent compelling interest
test is to be used only in public forums.
A is therefore incorrect because the fact
that the First Amendment is implicated
does not require always utilizing the
compelling interest level of scrutiny. B
is incorrect because Duke was not ar-
rested for a gun violation and because
the Second Amendment has not been
made applicable to the states. C is in-
correct for the same reasons that D is
correct.

24. A is the correct answer. As indicated by
ISKC-I and ISKC-II, the airports are not
public forums but non-public forums,
the reasonableness test is appropriate
as long as the regulation is not an at-
tempt to suppress the viewpoint of the
speaker. B, C and D are incorrect for
the same reasons that A is correct. 

198 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

25. D is the correct answer because only
choice I is correct. It is stipulated that
Duke's rights were, in part, violated.
The right violated occurred in the July
8 arrest by Darby. Duke's distribution
of free literature on July 8 was First
Amendment protected. A § 1983 suit
can be brought when there is such a
violation of civil rights. Thus, the gov-
ernmental body responsible for the ordi-
nance can be liable. The Port Authority
was that body, so choice I is correct.
Choices II and III are incorrect because
the arrests by Bart and Cary were for
commercial solicitation and, thus, were
valid under ISKC-I. Although Darby's
arrest was invalid, her (likely) good
faith is a complete defense to a § 1983
claim, so choice IV is incorrect.

26. B is the correct answer. The Congres-
sional Act may infringe on the Tenth
Amendment, which mandates that the
federal government not take powers
which were not expressly given to it,
by the Constitution. It is arguable that
in ordering the states to take title to
their own waste and pay damages, the
federal government is usurping state
power. Although in choice A there may
be some restraint on commerce, the re-
straint is by the federal government, so
the Commerce Clause is not implicated.
Although the Ninth Amendment might
be relevant in that it protects against
federal encroachment of unenumerated
rights, the history of that Amendment
indicates an unwillingness of the U.S.
Supreme Court to use it. B is incor-
rect. Choice D is viable, but not the
best alternative. It is difficult to see
how this could constitute a taking of
private property. Therefore, D is incor-
rect. Moreover, in New York v. United
States, 112 S.Ct. 2408 (1992) an issue
much like this was discussed. The High
Court chose to frame its analysis around
the Tenth Amendment. Therefore, since
there is a case directly on point, such is
controlling. The student should there-
fore note that success in Constitutional
Law depends as much on knowing the
key case holdings as it does on skill in
analysis. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 199

A...„..,,...,,.

27. C is the correct answer. This is a difficult
question, which, again, may require
knowledge of the case cited in answer
26. Our constitutional system sets up a
balance between the state and federal
governments. The federal government
can pre-empt state regulation which
is clearly contrary to federal interests.
But such jurisprudence falls short of
allowing the federal government to re-
quire the states to administer a federal
regulatory scheme. That would violate
the Tenth Amendment. In providing
incentives to the states to dispose of
waste, the Tenth Amendment has not
been violated. Thus, clauses 1 and 2
of the Act pass constitutional muster.
Therefore, choices A and B are in-
correct (because clauses 1 and 2 do
not violate the Tenth Amendment).
However, in mandating the states to
follow a regulatory scheme (clause 3),
Congress stepped over the fine line and
usurped states' rights. Therefore, C is
correct and D is incorrect. With this
analysis, the legitimate federal interest
in promoting waste disposal is allowed,
while the state government method is
not usurped.

28. B is the correct answer. The Island
Supreme Court should strike down the
more burdensome law of the city. A is
incorrect because freedom of association
is not the reason Norris will prevail. C
is incorrect because independant state
grounds is a doctrine on federal court
power to review state decisions. Bob
Norris' action is being brought in state
court. The doctrine of independent state
grounds does not apply.

29. D is the correct answer. Review of state
court decisions by the U.S. Supreme
Court is generally discretionary. It is
by petition on writ of certiorari. The
writ is granted when 4 of the 9 justices
wish to hear the case. Cases may be
accepted when there is confusion in
constitutional law, when there is a split
among the federal circuits or when the
justices desire to make a change in
the law. But, the point is, the decision
whether or not to review is in the hands
of the judges of the High Court. Thus,
choices A, B and C, which all indicate
the U.S. Supreme Court either must or
must not accept review, are incorrect.  

200 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

30. A is the correct answer. Under Illinois
State Board of Education v. Socialist
Worker's Party, 440 US 173 (1979),
the U.S. Supreme Court indicated that
the association rights implicit in the
First and Fourteenth Amendments are
infringed by ballot access rules. The
state must meet strict scrutiny to justify
their ballot restrictions. B is incorrect
because it states the rational basis test.
C is incorrect because this is not a fed-
eralism question, but an infringement
on fundamental federal constitutional
rights. Thus, the Tenth Amendment is
inapplicable. D is incorrect for the same
reason that A is correct.

31. A is the correct answer. Although in
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
Pennsylvania v. Casey, 112 S.Ct. 2791
(1992) [hereinafter Casey], the abor-
tion right was limited; such was not
over-ruled. Under Roe v. Wade, 410
U.S. 113 (1973), there was no right
to abortion when the fetus was viable,
i.e., in the third trimester because the
state's interest in protecting potential
life normally outweighed the mother's
right to terminate her pregnancy during
that time. Since this aspect of Roe has
remained intact, since Clause 1 did little
else than reiterate this and since the Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals must follow the
U.S. Supreme Court's pronouncements,
choice A is correct. Choices B and C are
incorrect because a first trimester fetus
has not been held to be a human. D is
incorrect for the same reasons that A is
correct.

32. D is the correct answer. Under Casey,
supra answer 31, the rigid trimester test
of Roe was abandoned. Under that test,
the woman had a right to abortion in
the First Trimester. Under Roe, there
could be no pre-viability regulation,
since the state's interests were not
compelling enough at that time. Under
Casey, however, a new "undue burden"
standard was created. Thus, pre-vi-
ability regulation is acceptable if such
does not place an undue burden on the
constitutionally-protected privacy right
of abortion. A one-day notice of alterna-
tives requirement, although a burden,
is not an undue burden — and, thus, is
constitutional under Casey. A is incor-
rect because the pre-viability regulation
aspect of Roe was abandoned. Although
B offers a correct statement of law,
abortion is not now... and even under
Roe, was not an absolute right. There
are and have been limitations. Choice C
is correct. However, D is a legally more
specific answer, and, thus, is the better
choice. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 201

35. A is the correct answer. When it is a
minor woman who wishes to have an
abortion, her decision may not be as
intelligently-made as that of an adult
female. Thus, under the Casey reason-
ing, supra answer 31, this limitation is
constitutional. Under the Casey analysis
as found by the Supreme Court, insu-
lation from others wishing to counsel
against the abortion is not required.
Thus, A is correct. Choices B, C and D
are incorrect under the law of Casey,
for the same reasons that A is correct.
B and C are incorrect because the rigid
trimester analysis of Roe has been aban-
doned. D is incorrect because the issue
is no longer open.

36. D is the correct answer. Requiring abor-
tion clinics and doctors to keep records
indicating that they have complied with
the constitutional aspects of a state's
law is legitimate. But, a clinic/doctor
cannot be compelled to keep a record
of something which they must not do.
The requirement of Clause 4 (husband
notification) places an undue burden
on the woman, Casey supra answer 31,
thus, choice D is correct. Since Clauses
1, 2, 3 and 5 are constitutional; choices
A, B and C, which each require excis-
ing one or more of these, are logically
incorrect.

A

33. D is the correct answer. All three aspects
of Clause 3 are constitutional under
Casey, supra answer 31, in that none
of them place an undue burden on the
woman seeking an abortion. The medi-
cal emergency aspect of Clause 3, in no
way limits the abortion right — thus, it
is certainly correct. The informed and
consent aspects of Clause 3, although
imposing a burden on the abortion right,
are little more than the requirement
that the woman be told of other options
prior. Thus, under the Casey test, they
are acceptable. Although choices A, B
and C all include approval of one aspect
of Clause 3, only choice D indicates all
three aspects of the clause are correct.
Thus, A, B and C are incorrect and D
is correct.

34. D is the correct answer. It may seem
that the requirement of notice to the
husband is no more burdensome than
the prior clauses, but the U.S. Supreme
Court held otherwise. The reasoning is
predicated on the fact that the women
so required are beyond the age of ma-
jority and that it is, thus, her decision
— not her husband's. Such clause would
prove to be an undue burden when,
for example, the husband and wife are
separated. Since it is the woman's inter-
est which is paramount, this clause is
unconstitutional. A is incorrect because
even notice to the husband is potentially
incendiary — and may be restrictive of
the abortion right. B is incorrect be-
cause the burden analysis focuses on the
woman — not her husband. C is incorrect
for the same reasons that D is correct.

202 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

37. B is the correct answer. The Commerce
Clause is violated when a state imposes
a use tax on a mail order business which
lacks a substantial nexus with the state.
Although selling goods in the state is
a sufficient minimum contact for Due
Process Clause analysis, it will not per
se satisfy the protections required by
the Commerce Clause. In fact, in  Quill 
Corp. v. North Dakota, 112 S.Ct. 1904
(1992), such a tax was held to violate
the Commerce Clause. Since choice A
utilized the inappropriate Due Process
test, it is incorrect. Since choices C and
D reached an incorrect conclusion (even
though the correct test was used), they
are incorrect.

A

38. D is the correct answer. The Clin-
tonia Hate Crime Law violates the
First Amendment Freedom of Speech
Clause (as applied to the states by the
Fourteenth Amendment Due Process
Clause). It is "overbroad" in that it goes
beyond the constitutional standard for
punishment in substantially all of its
applications. The law not only prohib-
its so-called fighting words, but also
prohibits the stating of views which,
though unpopular, are within the tra-
ditional domain of First Amendment
protection. For example, under the
Hate Crime Law as written, it would be
criminal to give a speech denouncing
one race. Of course such is offensive
— but traditional and present analysis
protects such — leaving it to the free
market of ideas to prove it wrong. See
R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, Minnesota,
112 S.Ct. 2538 (1992). Choice A is in-
correct because the fact that all of the
written elements of a crime are pres-
ent does not insulate the crime from
constitutional attack (or defense). B is
incorrect because although Skin's acts
were undoubtedly not constitutionally
protected, nevertheless, he must be
convicted under a legitimate, i.e., con-
stitutional crime. Thus, B is incorrect
for the same reasons that D is correct.
C is incorrect because although there
was no mens rea (mental state) in the
crime, this is not relevant to the Free
Speech question at issue. D is the better
choice. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 203

A

39. D is the correct answer. Although Skin
committed a criminal assault, to be
convicted he must be charged under
a constitutional crime. This crime
was facially unconstitutional in that
it prohibited not only unprotected
speech and action, but it also prohib-
ited protected speech. For example, it
prohibited a public forum racist/sexist
speech. Though such is distasteful, the
U.S. Supreme Court has realized that
it is a greater danger to prohibit such
than it is to allow it. Alternately stated,
the Hate Crime Law was overbroad.
A is incorrect because a conviction
is unconstitutional if the crime is un-
constitutional — regardless of whether
the defendant was proven to commit it
and regardless of whether there is an-
other, different, crime under which the
defendant should have been charged.
B is incorrect. Although Skin's threat
was a criminal assault — was "fighting
words" — the crime under which he was
charged is clearly unconstitutional. See
R.A.V. v. St. Paul, supra answer 38.
Although C is arguably correct, some
crimes can be "strict liability" — often
the court will read in a mens rea — but
more importantly, D is a better choice.
Thus, C is incorrect.

204 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

40. C is the correct answer, since both
choices I and II are correct. This ques-
tion does not call for a judgment wheth-
er the statute is constitutional. Rather,
it simply calls for statutory analysis.
Since the facts indicate that Toggle
was paid $7333 by Violence Press and
inferentially, that Violence Press did
not pay the Bronsonia Victim's Fund,
it is reasonable to conclude they vio-
lated §208.2. Thus, choice I is correct.
These same facts reasonably indicate
that Toggle kept this money — did not
pay it to the Bronsonia Victim's Fund.
Therefore, choice II is correct. Since
C alone includes choices I and II, it is
correct.

41. D is the best answer. Bronsonia adopted
a so-called "Son of Sam" law. The U.S.
Supreme Court examined a similar law
in Simon & Schuster Inc. v. Members
of the New York State Crime Victim's 
Board, 112 S.Ct. 501 (1991). In broad
statement, it was there held that such
laws violate the First Amendment Free
Speech and Press Clauses. Moreover,
paying close attention to the facts of
Question #41, it appears that Junkins
was not even in violation of the statute!
Junkins was neither the co-author nor
the lawyer. Therefore, choices A, B and
C are all obviously incorrect. Although
the reason why the prosecution would
fail (which is given in choice D) is
incorrect — or at the least incomplete
nevertheless, D is the best of the an-
swers given. 

42. B is the correct answer, since choices
I and II are correct. Choice I is correct
because, in order to limit First Amend-
ment Free Speech and Press on the
basis of content, the regulation must be
narrowly tailored to further a compel-
ling state interest. Choice II is correct
because in placing a burden on those
who merely admitted to crimes (but
who were not prosecuted or convicted),
§208.1 was overbroad. If First Amend-
ment freedoms are to be limited by the
law, the limitation must be narrowly
tailored. Choice III is false because the
Bronsonia procedure is an after-the-fact
punishment of speech and therefore
does not set up a prior resraint.

43. C is the correct answer. Article I, §2 of
the U.S. Constitution provides certain
rudimentary requirements regarding
the allotment to the states of Repre-
sentatives (e.g., no fewer than one).
However, constitutional jurisprudence
has essentially left the matter in the
hands of Congress. Since the early part
of this century, Congress has utilized
an "equal apportionment" method. In
United States Department of Commerce
v. Montana, 112 S.Ct. 1415 (1992), this
method was challenged. The High court
upheld it. A is incorrect because the
method of apportionment is essentially
within the domain of Congress. There-
fore, choices A and B, which make it
mandatory, are incorrect. C is correct
because Congress is within its legiti-
mate jurisdiction by using this method.
D is incorrect for the same reasons that
C is correct.

A

44. B is the correct answer because only
choices I and III are correct. State-run
(public) schooling is considered to be
state-action; and, thus, as in Brown v. 
Board, there are constitutional ramifica-
tions of such. In Brown, it was reasoned
that separate public schools, based on
race, are inherently unequal. Thus,
choice I is correct. In discerning which
aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment
was violated, that court logically chose
the Equal Protection Clause (since
similarly situated individuals were not
being treated in a like manner). Thus,
choice III is correct. Since the court did
not rely on other aspects of the Four-
teenth Amendment, choices II and IV
are incorrect.

45. D is the correct answer. As recently
held in United States v. Fordice, 112
S.Ct. 2727 (1992), the repercussions
of de jure segregation are in no way al-
leviated by an open admissions policy
(race-neutrality) that perpetuates past
discrimination. Thus, A is incorrect.
Similarly, if the effects of segregation
still exist, then, as a matter of law, there
is more that can be accomplished — so
B is incorrect. C is incorrect because
the state-applicable Fourteenth Amend-
ment specifically limits states' rights. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 205

46. B is the correct answer because choices
I, II and III are correct. Choice I is
correct because an individual cannot
utilize court process unless he or she
has a claim in which she is a party.
Here, Daniel lacks sufficient nexus to
the issue. There are no facts that he is
a mobile home park landlord, or that
he is trying to raise rents, or even that
he lives in Marblestone. Choice II is
correct because there is no justifiable
argument at present (see previous an-
swer on standing). More fundamentally,
choice III is correct because there is
no present controversy, nor is Daniel a
party to anything. Choice IV is incor-
rect because although Yee v. City of
Escondido, 112 S.Ct. 1522 (1992) held
there is no constitutional taking in this
situation, there is still a federal question
to be decided.

47. A is the correct answer. An individual
needs more than a mere possibility of
economic interest to have his case be
heard. Norris' "case" is not ripe. For
it to be ripe, he would have to buy the
park and attempt to raise the rent. As
Yee, supra answer 46 indicates, such
an ordinance is not a taking and, thus,
does not implicate the Just Compensa-
tion Clause. Therefore, choices B and
C are incorrect. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that A is correct.

48. A is the correct answer. For those stu-
dents choosing an incorrect answer, it
should be remembered that prior ques-
tions do not teach the law [i.e., Question
47 may have indicated incorrect law.]
As Yee, supra answer 46 indicated,
for there to be a governmental taking,
thus, implicating the Just Compensa-
tion Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments (via Due Process), there
must be a physical occupation/trespass/
invasion of the property or a regulatory
taking that goes too far. This kind of
rent control law does not implicate the
Clause. B is incorrect because the Just
Compensation Clause was selectively
incorporated into the state-applicable
Fourteenth Amendment Due Process
Clause. C is incorrect because the case
is ready for adjudication. D is incorrect
for the same reasons that A is correct.

49. D is the correct answer. As indicated in
Richmond Newspapers. Inc. v. Virginia,
448 U.S. 555 (1980), the public and
press have a First Amendment right
to have trial be open. Thus, open tri-
als are not only for the benefit of the
parties — but are also for the benefit of
society's perception of justice. Thus,
party consent is essentially irrelevant
and A is incorrect. Choices B and C are
incorrect for the same reason that D is
correct. 

206 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

50. D is the correct answer. Richmond
Newspapers, supra answer 49, indicates
that all trials must usually be open to the
press and public — regardless of party
consent. Thus, D is correct and A, B and
C are incorrect.

51. C is the correct answer. In Gannett
Co.. Inc. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368
(1979), it was held that in certain ex-
tenuating/prejudicial circumstances
the press and public could be barred
from pre-trial admissibility hearings
— provided that a transcript of the hear-
ing was made available to the press and
public soon thereafter. Thus, since there
is a diminished First Amendment right
in the fact-pattern of pre-trial, the press
and public do not have an absolute right
to be there. Therefore, A is incorrect. B
is incorrect because, as a general rule,
the press and public can be present at
pretrial hearings. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that C is correct.

52. D is the correct answer. It matters not
that the trial concerns an alleged victim
who is a minor. Richmond Newspapers,
supra answer 49, draws no distinction.
Thus, post-trial availability of a tran-
script does not cure the First Amend-
ment flaw. Therefore, choices A and C
are incorrect. Similarly, since the free
press right is not only for the parties, but
for the public at large, minor consent
is essentially irrelevant and B is incor-
rect.

53. C is the correct answer. Waller v. Geor-
gia, 467 U.S. 39 (1984), indicates that
cameras in the courtroom is a matter of
state decision. There is no constitutional
First Amendment Free Press right to
televise court proceedings. Some states
do and some do not. Interestingly, the
U.S. Supreme Court does not allow its
own proceedings to be televised. Noth-
ing in the Constitution mandates it, and
nothing prohibits it. Therefore, under
the Tenth Amendment (Independent
State Grounds Clause), such is within
the discretion of the states. For the same
(above) reasons that C is correct, A, B
and D are incorrect.

54. B is the correct answer. Under Em-
ployment Division v. Smith, the Court
stated that criminal statutes applied
evenhandedly towards religion may
regulate conduct arguably the subject of
a Free Exercise claim. Thus, if Jessica's
requiring $400 dues per month is con-
strued to be a fee for her sexual encoun-
ters, then she may well be found guilty
of prostitution. A is incorrect because
the Freedom of Religion Clause does
not protect all "conduct." C is incor-
rect because consent is irrelevant to the
crime of prostitution. D is incorrect for
two reasons. First, the U.S. Supreme
Court is loathe to adjudge the merits
or lack thereof of a religion. Cf. United
States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 (1944).
Second, even if a religion is legitimate
and traditional, nevertheless conduct of
its adherents can be regulated. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 207

55. A is the correct answer. Prostitution
is sex-for-hire. Obviously, if Jessica's
church had other functions and activi-
ties and if the payment of money was
not for sex with Jessica, she can argue
that the gravamen of her religion was
not sex-for-hire. These arguments may
not be accepted, but they are the best of
the offered answers. B is a weak answer
— there can be a house of prostitution
even if there is only one prostitute. C
might be correct, except that it is less
specific than A. Taken literally, C is a
poor answer — because even in a brothel
there are other activities besides sex
(e.g., presumably talking and sleep-
ing). D is incorrect because religious
conduct is not always First Amendment
protected, Smith supra answer 54.

56. Answer B is correct. The Court in Law-
rence v. Texas (2003) stopped just short
of holding that there is a fundamental
right of privacy to engage in non-mari-
tal sexual activity for all persons. That
case and Eisenstadt v. Baird, contained
much that casts great doubt on a state's
authority to criminalize consentual ex-
tra-marital sexual activity between two
persons. Thus, answer A is not correct
and answer B is closer to the sense of
Lawrence. Answers C and D are irrel-
evant.

208 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

57. B is the correct answer. Although the
First Amendment Freedom of the Press
will not allow the incitement of another
to imminent lawless activity, most any-
thing short of that is protected. Bran-
denburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969).
Writing a book on an unusual religion
and/or on unusual sex is certainly First
Amendment protected. A is arguably
correct, but it is not the best answer,
simply because the book appears to be
available to the general public. It does
not appear to be the dogma of Jessica's
church. C is incorrect because the pen-
umbra privacy right flowing from the
whole Bill of Rights is not the basis for
her claim. She is not engaging in this
behavior under this question, but writ-
ing about it. D is incorrect because the
book has little to do with association
and more to do with speech.

58. A is the correct answer. In Griswold
v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965),
it was held that making criminal the
use of contraceptives between a hus-
band and wife was unconstitutional in
that the marital right to privacy was
fundamental. Thus, what Jessica does
with her husband, in the bedroom, is
constitutionally protected. B is incorrect
because it misreads the facts, Jessica's
right to marry was not being questioned.
C is incorrect because religious conduct
is not always protected by the Free Ex-
ercise clause. Smith supra answer 54.
D is incorrect for the same reasons that
A is correct. 

59. D is the correct answer. In a long line
of cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has
upheld the validity of the so-called
Sunday closing laws. Were the Court
to have construed these laws as Estab-
lishing the Christian Sabbath, then, of
course, they would have been suspect.
However, they have been upheld on
secular grounds. That is, they promote
a uniform day of rest and repose in the
community. Such has been held to be a
valid state interest. McGowan v. Mary-
land, 366 U.S. 420 (1961); Two Guys 
v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582 (1961).
A is incorrect because the law in no
way limits Rex Bookstore's offering
of specific books or their availability
to be open on other days of the week.
B is incorrect because the Commerce
Clause is irrelevant to intrastate regu-
lation. It forbids states interfering with
commerce between their sister states.
C is incorrect because the Blue Laws
have been construed as non-religious in
content. Since A, B and C are incorrect;
D is the best choice.

A

r- 

60. D is the correct answer. Although this
question poses a more difficult query
than in Question 59, supra, the analysis
is the same. The Sunday closing laws
have been held not to be an establish-
ment of religion for the purpose of es-
tablishing the Christian Sabbath. Rather
they are for creating a uniform day of
rest. The purpose is secular — not reli-
gious. Thus, A is incorrect. Braunfeld v. 
Braun, 366 U.S. 599 (1961); Gallagher
v. Crown Kosher Market, 366 U.S. 67
(1960). B is incorrect because the exer-
cise of Judaism, itself, was not impeded
by the law. Some conduct motivated
by religion may have been made more
economically burdensome — but the law
was neutral on its face. C is incorrect
because the state, in fact, performed
no taking. It may have made business
more difficult — but such does not rank
as a taking. Therefore, since choices
A, B and C are incorrect, D is the best
answer.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 209

62. D is the correct answer. As indicated by
Wooley, supra answer 61, Ted's appeal
will be successful on First Amendment
grounds. A is incorrect because, even
though he did deface public property,
the First Amendment may still bar con-
viction for some crimes. B is incorrect
because, although there is a constitu-
tional distinction between belief and
conduct, not all conduct is automatical-
ly able to be regulated consistent with
the Free Exercise Clause. C is incorrect
because Freedom of Association is not
implicated by the problem. D is correct
for the same reasons that A, B and C are
incorrect. 

61. A is the correct answer. This question is
important in showing two points. First,
in constitutional analysis, it is always
important to discern which clause is at
issue. Second, the law is not always per-
fectly logical. Rather, the law is driven
by case decisions which are directly on
point. Thus, mastery of Constitutional
law requires knowing the holdings of
the basic cases. A correct answer to
this question requires knowledge of the
important case of Wooley v. Maynard,
430 U.S. 705 (1977). There, it was held
that a Jehovah's Witness had the right
to cover what he believed to be the
sacrilegious motto of New Hampshire's
license plate: "Live Free or Die".
Since the case precedent is couched
in terms of Free Speech and not Free
Exercise, A is the correct answer. Cur-
rently, Employment Division v. Smith
would make a free exercise claim much
weaker against a neutral state law of
general applicability, like the license
plate regulation. Since Wooley is con-
trolling, B is correct and A is incorrect.
Since no facts whatsoever indicate an
unlawful search or seizure, choice C
is obviously incorrect. Since no facts
indicate Ted's association rights were
in any way infringed, D is obviously
incorrect.

210 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

63. C is the correct answer. Although none
of these answers state the correct rule
of law with precision, C is the so-called
"best of the worst." In West Virginia
Board of Education v. Barnette, 319
U.S. 624 (1943), it was held that requir-
ing a grade school student to salute the
flag, when such impinged on his ability
not to be forced into supporting or ap-
pearing to support the viewpoint of the
government violated his Free Speech
rights. A is factually incorrect because
this act did infringe on his freedom
of religion and the Court should not
be in the position of judging what is
truly contrary to a person's religious
beliefs. B is incorrect because, in the
case at hand, Jeremiah's beliefs are be-
ing interfered with by the state. Thus,
family values are being infringed. D is
incorrect because adjudging the merits
(or alleged lack thereof) of a religion is
antithetical to the Free Exercise Clause.
Cf. United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S.
78 (1944). Although nothing in the
Constitution explicitly protects "family
values," C is, nevertheless, the "best"
answer, since it reaches the correct
conclusion without badly misstating the
law of the Free Speech Clause.

A

O

O

64. B is the correct answer. Although there
are certainly some limits as to when a
parent can take a child out of a public
school for due process Privacy reasons,
when this is based on religious reasons
the U.S. Supreme Court has been more
tolerant. Thus, in Wisconsin v. Yoder,
406 U.S. 205 (1972), a parent was al-
lowed to cease a child's education at 14
even though the state required educa-
tion until the age of 16. Since this case
is directly on point and corresponds to
the facts in this question, B is the correct
answer. Note, Yoder was reconfirmed
by the Court's opinion and  Employment
Division v. Smith, even after Smith
changed Free Exercise jurisprudence.
Although the child may "lose out," a
principle of our constitutional juris-
prudence is to not adjudge different
views on how religions conduct their
family affairs. Thus, A is incorrect. C
is partially correct and partially incor-
rect. The state does have a compelling
interest in the education of minors and
this interest will allow interference of a
parent in a minor's education but only
up to a point. In Yoder, supra, that point
was not met. So, essentially, C is legally
correct and factually incorrect. D is
clearly incorrect because public schools
have jurisdiction over their students.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 211

65. C is the correct answer. This issue was
directly addressed in Pierce v. Society
of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925). Pro-
vided that the private religious school
teaches the basics (reading, writing,
science), the state cannot forbid such
under Fourteen Amendment Due Pro-
cess. The Supreme Court used Privacy
to decide Pierce (choice I). Choice II,
Free Exercise, would also be correct
here under Yoder. However, there is
no claim that this is an establishment
clause violation, unless the state is try-
ing to make students attend school in
order to advance or inhibit religious
belief. There are no facts on that point
here. Thus, II is incorrect. Therefore,
C is correct and A, B and D are incor-
rect.

66. A is the correct answer. The Free Exer-
cise Clause of the First Amendment has
been interpreted to prohibit "meddling"
by the state or federal governments in
intra-church disputes (except those, of
course, which regard crimes). Serbian
Orthodox Diocese v. Milijevich, 426
U.S. 696 (1975). State interference
would compromise the Free Exercise
of that religion. Therefore, A is the
correct answer. Many religions are not
democratically run. Were the state to
impose its own notions of election on
the religion, there is a very unrealistic
argument that the state is choosing
one form of religion over another and,
therefore, an Establishment Clause
violation. But B is not a better answer
than A. Although there is a possible
case or controversy here, the Court has
refused due to Free Exercise questions
to have the federal courts hear these
types of cases. C is incorrect. D is also
incorrect. 

212 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

67. D is the correct answer. Although cer-
tain sexually explicit behavior is con-
sidered to be protected by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments, as "symbolic
speech"; nevertheless, the states are
permitted great latitude in regulating
public sexually explicit activity based
on their own community standards
— even if the activity is arguably artistic.
Recently, in Barnes v. Glen Theatre,
501 U.S. 540 (1991), the High Court
upheld the requirement that women not
completely bare themselves in an adult
club (breast "pasties" were a legitimate
requirement). Thus, since the Puritania
statute did little more than the regula-
tion in Barnes, it is not unconstitutional
on its face. A is incorrect because it
misunderstands the point that symbolic
speech is given some First Amendment
protection. B is incorrect because sexu-
ally explicit conduct can be regulated
— just as Puritania has done. C is incor-
rect because the statute is not vague (a
person of ordinary intelligence would
know what was prohibited and the stat-
ute does not give too much discretion
to the police). Since A, B and C are
incorrect, D is the correct choice.

68. C is the correct answer. As indicated by
Barnes, supra answer 67, a community
is permitted to prohibit topless dancing
at public places by females. A is obvi-
ously incorrect because were the law is
overbroad, then the defendants would
succeed. B is incorrect because com-
munities are permitted to regulate pub-
lic nudity without offending the First
Amendment. D is incorrect because
although there was arguably an artistic
and, thus, "symbolic speech" aspect to
the dancing, it has been held that requir-
ing some clothing is inoffensive to the
First Amendment Free Speech Clause.
Barnes, supra answer 67.

69. B is the correct answer. Although she
might claim that her actions were sym-
bolic speech, the question is not what
she intends as much as it is why the
government is prosecuting her. If they
were to prosecute her because of the
message of her conduct, she might have
a symbolic speech claim. That is not the
case here. A is incorrect. The elements
of the crime have been committed. C
is incorrect. The fact that her acts were
in public is relevant, but not the only
issue under the statute. D is incorrect
because her conduct was arguably lewd
and lascivious. 

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 213

70. D is the correct answer. A correct an-
swer here requires interpreting the plain
meaning of the Puritania statute. Since
nudity means a lack of clothing, and
since exposure is used in the context
of the statute, it is apparent that the
statute does not regulate the wearing
of tight and shear clothing. Such is not
"exposure" under the Puritania statute.
Therefore, D is correct. A is incorrect
because being guilty of a related crime
most obviously does not make one
guilty of another crime! B is incorrect
because although Chipmunks was prob-
ably quite contrary to Puritania's com-
munity standards, that, in itself, cannot
be and was not made a crime without a
law on the books. C is incorrect because
it is irrelevant. Prostitution was not the
crime which was charged.

71. C is the correct answer. This is a tricky
question. Clearly, Darby is not guilty of
Puritania's sexual nudity law, because
she was not nude under the language
of the statute. Thus, she has no need to
avail herself of the First Amendment
defense. However, the call of the ques-
tion was whether a First Amendment
defense would prevail. The interroga-
tory was not whether she was factually
guilty of the crime. Therefore, C is cor-
rect because there was no First Amend-
ment protection to her non-artistic sales
approach. A is incorrect only because
it is irrelevant. The query went not to
guilt — but rather to the applicability
of the First Amendment. B is incorrect
because no facts suggested Darby was
doing anything artistic while selling
the hot dogs. D is incorrect not only
because it fails to address the call of
the question (the First Amendment), but
also because she is likely not factually
guilty (since she was not nude).

72. B is the correct answer. Flag-burning, as
political protest, be it of a state or a fed-
eral flag, is considered to be symbolic
speech, and is, thus, First Amendment
protected. United States v. Eichman,
496 U.S. 310 (1990). Therefore, B is
correct. A is incorrect for the same
reason that B is correct; and is also
incorrect because the crime was not
strict liability (it included the mens rea
of "purposely"). C and D are incorrect
for the same reason that B is correct. 

214 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

73. D is the correct answer. In  Employment
Division of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S.
872 (1990), the U.S. Supreme Court
indicated that it was permissible to
withhold employment benefits from
a Native American who used the con-
trolled substance of peyote as sacra-
ment in his Native American religion.
His claim was, of course, that his First
Amendment Free Exercise of Religion
rights were abrogated. However, the
Court held that even if a law works to
the detriment of one religion, it does
not violate the First Amendment unless
that religion is singled out by the state
as an object of persecution. In dictum,
the Court also indicated that no compel-
ling interest need be shown — even if
the law works to the detriment of one
religion-provided the law is neutral on
its face. Since the facts of question 73
are directly on point to the Smith case,
Smith controls and the prosecution of
Father O'Scalia will succeed. A and B
are incorrect for the same reason that
D is correct. C is incorrect because Fa-
ther 0' Scalia was in no way impeded
from associating with members of his
church.

74. D is the correct answer. This is a simple
"black letter" question. Pursuant to
Article I, §7, both houses of Congress
can overturn a presidential veto by two-
thirds vote. Because no U.S. Supreme
Court has in any way modified the in-
terpretation of this clause, D is correct
and A, B and C are incorrect.

A

75. C is the correct answer because only
choice II is correct. Pursuant to Article
II, §2, the President — not Congress
— has the power of judicial appoint-
ment. Therefore, the act in question is
clearly contrary to the language of the
Constitution and is, thus, unconstitu-
tional. Cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S.
1 (1976). For this reason, choice II is
correct. Choice I, however, is incorrect
because the language of the Constitu-
tion (Article II, §7) indicates that such
appointment must be with the advice
and consent of the Senate. The power
of appointment is, therefore, not solely
a presidential decision.

76. B is the correct answer. Article I, §6,
clause 1 affords all U.S. Senators and
representatives immunity for their leg-
islative functions. Since on the facts
given Semand was simply debating
whether or not to give a grant, he has
complete immunity. Gravel v. United
States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972). A is not,
per se, incorrect. Rather, it is simply not
the best answer. The above-cited clause
gives far better protection. C is incor-
rect for the same reason that B is cor-
rect; and also because no facts indicate
XYZ University to be a public entity.
D is incorrect for the same reason that
B is correct, and also because the facts
indicate it was not the government, but
rather Semand who was being sued.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 215

77. D is the correct answer. The Speech and
Debate Clause (Article I, §6, clause 1)
does not protect a legislator from ex-
traordinary acts, such as taking a bribe.
United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501
(1972). A is incorrect since it was not
the government which was being sued.
B is inane because suits can be brought
even when the allegations are difficult
to prove. C is incorrect since bribe
taking is beyond the protections of the
Speech and Debate Clause. Since A, B
and C are all incorrect; D (none of the
above) is the best answer.

78. C is the correct answer. The presidential
power to pardon is broad. However, it
does not include the right to pardon for
state crimes. The language of Article
II, §2 is limited to crimes against the
federal government. Since C states the
limitation correctly, it is the correct
answer. A is constitutionally incorrect.
The pardon power does not attach to
state crimes. B is incorrect because
the power to pardon extends beyond
political crimes (which, in fact, may be
a meaningless term). D is incorrect for
the same reason that C is correct.

79. B is the correct answer. The President's
power to pardon is limited to pardon of
federal crimes. However, the pardon is
not prospective. Thus, the pardon does
not cover crimes committed after the
effective date of the pardon. Therefore,
B is correct. Article II, §2. A is incorrect
because Pilson may have committed
crimes while in office, but after the date
of the pardon. C is incorrect because it
is irrelevant whether the pardon-giving
president is still in office. D is incorrect
because the pardon power is not limited
to non-infamous crimes.

80. A is the correct answer. The U.S. Su-
preme Court has original and exclusive
jurisdiction over foreign ambassadors.
Article III, §2. Therefore, Oregon does
not have jurisdiction. Since it is a far
better defense to prove that the pros-
ecuting court lacks jurisdiction than that
an element of the crime was not met
(choice B) or that there is an available
affirmative defense (choice C), choice
A is superior to choices B and C. Since
a state, as a general rule, does have
jurisdiction over foreigners, choice D
is incorrect. 

216 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

81. D is the correct answer. This is another
question — so typical of the multistate
format where the answer which one
looks for is simply not there. Thus, one
has to choose among a series of answers
— none of which are perfect. There
is no constitutionally-conferred state
sovereign immunity. Cf. Fitzpatrick v. 
Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1979). Thus, A
is incorrect. B is incorrect because the
Eleventh Amendment grants immunity
to states for suits against a state in fed-
eral court initiated by a citizen of the
state when the citizen seeks damages.
But it does not grant immunity against
suits for injunctive relief or against state
officials in their individual capacity.
Fitzpatrick. C is completely incorrect in
that the powers not given to the federal
government are reserved to the states
under the Tenth Amendment. Since the
Constitution is silent on this point, this
choice is inapplicable. Since A, B and C
are all incorrect, D is the best of a series
of poor choices, since depending on the
facts of Moss's suit, it may or may not
be dismissed. But it can not be due to
the reasons stated in A, B or C. There-
fore, D is the most correct answer.

O

82. C is the correct answer. Although the
Congressional power to subpoena
is broad, it is not absolute. Thus, of
course, a subpoena cannot compel a
person to incriminate herself (as per
the Fifth Amendment self-incrimina-
tion clause). But, and more to point
here, the subpoena must be relevant. If
the subpoena is not reasonably-related
to the investigation, it is beyond the
legitimate power of Congress. Gibson
v. Florida Legislative Committee,  372
U.S. 539 (1963). A subpoena which had
required lists of "donors" or perhaps
lists of "other candidates" might have
been specific enough. However, this
subpoena was too broad, and, thus,
among other things (such as potentially
chilling First Amendment Freedom of
Association rights), it was irrelevant. A
is incorrect because there was neither
Executive nor Judicial function im-
paired by this subpoena. B is incorrect
because there was no state action. D is
incorrect for the same reasons that C is
correct.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

217

83. D is the correct answer. Although the
state is likely to lose this case and none
of the answers are particularly good, D
is the only one that is really possible
here. A is incorrect because of Law-
rence v. Texas (2003) which overruled
Bowers v. Hardwick (1986). Thus,
state laws on homosexual sodomy are
unconstitutional. B is incorrect because
whether or not there is a constitutional
right to marry, that is not the issue
— the racial classification is. Once the
state permits gay people to marry, they
cannot deny it on racial grounds. C is
incorrect because the statement as it
stands is false. The Court has found in
a number of cases that there is a right to
privacy. Although marriage regulations
are not totally within the state's power,
they are traditionally there. Thus, D is
the most correct of these choices.

84. D is the correct answer. A state may not
be required to permit marriage between
persons of the same sex, however once it
has done so, it cannot prohibit marriage
based on the race of the participants.
Race-based regulations are accept-
able only when there is a "compelling
state interest." Race-based regulations
are inherently "suspect." On the facts
given, it is unconstitutional for the state,
on the one hand, to allow homosexual
marriage, but on the other, to require
such occur only between members of
the same race. A is incorrect because
the Supreme Court has not held that the
constitutional right to privacy includes
homosexual marriage. B is incorrect
because the constitutional clause at
issue is not Due Process, but rather
Equal Protection (unequal treatment of
those who are similarly situated). C is
incorrect because the correct analysis,
when race is at issue, is not whether the
state regulation has a rational basis, but,
rather, whether it is necessary to achieve
a compelling state interest. 

218 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

85. C is the correct answer. McLaughlin
v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184 (1964) and
Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967),
together stand for the proposition that
a state cannot make crimes or marriage
depend on the race of the participants
absent a compelling government in-
terest. Otherwise there is a denial of
Equal Protection. Certainly a state is
not required to allow homosexual mar-
riage. However, once they allow it, they
cannot limit it to those of the same race
— without violating the Equal Protection
Clause. Therefore, the law is settled.
Just as in McLaughlin, supra, the state
was not required to allow sexual co-
habitation — but once the state allowed
it, the state cannot punish it differently
because of race. A and B are incorrect
because they miss the mark. There may
be a right to engage in private consen-
sual homosexual activity under the
Due Process clause, Lawrence v. Texas
(2003), but that is not relevant to this
question.

86. D is the correct answer because choices
I, II and III are all incorrect. Choice
I is incorrect because it misreads the
facts. The warrant was stipulated to be
"proper." Choice II is incorrect because
it also misreads the facts — the video
was "lawfully intercepted." Choice III
is incorrect because there is no right to
possess child pornography or obscenity
in the home. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S.
103 (1990).

87. C is the correct answer. Although
speech with a profit motive is not
given the same degree of protection as
political speech, it is nevertheless First
Amendment protected. Provided the
ad is truthful and not misleading, the
state can limit the ad only if there is a
substantial interest which is narrowly
tailored to meet that interest. Virginia
State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia
Citizens Consumer Council,  425 U.S.
748 (1976). The outright clothing ad
ban of Lemon County is certainly not
narrowly-tailored; no facts indicate the
ad to be deceptive; and the state-inter-
est is not shown. Therefore, the First
Amendment offers protection. A is
incorrect because a state's police pow-
ers do not include the infringement of
First Amendment rights. B is incorrect
because no legitimate state interest was
shown, and because the other prongs of
the commercial speech doctrine were
not met. D is incorrect because no facts
indicate a restriction of interstate com-
merce.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 219

88. A is the correct answer. The Supremacy
Clause of Article IV, §2 indicates that
a ratified treaty is the supreme law of
the land and that a state cannot interfere
with such. Nielson v. Johnson, 279 U.S.
47 (1929). On the facts given, it appears
that Lemon County is directly impeding
the free trade between the foreign coun-
try and the U.S. Therefore, A is correct.
B is incorrect because no facts indicate
that privileges or immunities of U.S.
citizens are being denied. C is incorrect
because it is so general an answer as to
be meaningless. Even the treaty power,
just alluded to, requires Senate ratifica-
tion. D is incorrect because the Tenth
Amendment only allows the states to
regulate in the areas of non-enumerated
federal powers. Treaties, however, are
a federal power, supra.

89. C is the correct answer. As Virginia
State Board of Pharmacy, supra answer
87, and Bates v. State Bar Of Arizona,
433 U.S. 350 (1977) indicate; ads by
professionals (be they by pharmacists,
lawyers, or, inferentially, doctors) are
given significant First Amendment pro-
tection, as under the so-called "Com-
mercial Speech Doctrine." The statute
may have some ambiguities in it, but it
is not so vague that a person of aver-
age intelligence would not know how
to conform his conduct to the law. If
you are a doctor or lawyer, you can not
advertise. Therefore, C is correct and
A is incorrect. B is incorrect because,
on the facts, it does appear that certain
individuals in Lemon County are pres-
ently affected. Since the controversy is
"ripe." B is incorrect. Since there was
no governmental taking, Just Compen-
sation Clause analysis is irrelevant and
D is therefore incorrect.

220 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

92. A is the correct answer. The procedural
aspect of due process requires that there
be notice and a hearing prior to the de-
privation of property rights. Attendance
at public school has been held to be a
property right. Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S.
565 (1975). Therefore, there was a de-
nial of due process in the case at hand
— because of the lack of a hearing. B is
incorrect because although flag burning,
in political protest, is a right — there are
certain limitations placed on that right.
Obviously, it must be your own flag (or
there is malicious mischief) and the flag
must be burned pursuant to reasonable
time, place and manner restrictions. C
is incorrect because the specificity of
a political protest is not relevant to the
issue. D is incorrect because it is non-
sense. The reference to shouting "Fire!"
in a crowded theatre is from Justice
Holmes and he said that the government
may punish sommeone for a FALSE
shout of "Fire!" in a crowded theatre,
meaning that there were restrictions on
speech permitted to the government for
the greater public good.

90. C is the correct answer. Pursuant to
Article I, §8, clause 4, Congress has
jurisdiction over the states regarding
the law of bankruptcy. Thus, since
Congress has established bankruptcy
laws (which allow individuals a new
beginning), a state cannot contravene
those laws by forever penalizing an
individual for a bankruptcy. Therefore,
C is correct. Choices A and B are also
correct answers, but they are not as pre-
cise as C. Moreover, state fact-findings
are given great deference on federal ap-
peal. Thus, attacking Barrier's factual
conclusions of a lack of moral fitness
and insufficient "rehabilitation" are far
more difficult hurdles than attacking the
law which they utilized to reach those
conclusions. D is incorrect for all of the
above reasons.

91. C is the correct answer. Although there
is some variance in the use of these
admittedly facially ambiguous terms,
the two aspects of due process are: 1)
fair procedures before life, liberty or
property is denied (procedural); and 2)
substantive rights without which society
would not be free (substantive). Since
choice C best approximates the above
definition, it is correct. The distinction
made in choice A has not been utilized
by the High Court; thus, it is incorrect.
Choices B and D are incorrect for the
same reason that choice C is correct.

93. A is correct because only choices I and
II are true. If he was punished because
the flag he burnt was not his own, that
is not punishment for speech purposes
and tested at a lower level. Similarly, if
the issue is time, place and manner re-
strictions, they too are for non-speech-
related purposes and teested at a lower
standard. Statements III and IV are ac-
curate as far as they go, but they do not
help resolve this problem, since those
issues are not involved here. Choice  III
is incorrect because it is irrelevant. The
issue here is not suspension from school
— it is criminal prosecution. Choice IV
is incorrect for the same reasons that
choice II is correct. Since only letter A
includes choices I and II, it is the correct
answer.

94. D is the correct answer. Since the facts
stipulated Junior's new school to be a
private school, there is no state action;
and, thus, the Fourteenth Amendment
Due Process Clause is inapplicable.
Therefore choices A, B and C are incor-
rect; and choice D is correct.

95. D is the correct answer. Although not
offered as a choice, the applicable
constitutional clause is Fourteenth
Amendment Equal Protection. Ille-
gitimacy has been deemed to require
intermediate scrutiny when a state
regulation adversely affects such status.
Moreover, Levy v. Louisiana, 391 U.S.
68 (1968), held a highly similar state
statute to be unconstitutional on these
grounds. Choices A, B and C reach the
wrong conclusion; so each is obviously
incorrect. Moreover, A is incorrect be-
cause there are no Tenth Amendment
independent state grounds. The state-
applicable Fourteenth Amendment
Equal Protection Clause is controlling.
Choices B and C are incorrect, not only
in reaching the wrong conclusion, but
also because they utilize the incorrect
level of scrutiny as required by the
Equal Protection Clause (which in this
case requires mid-level scrutiny). 

222 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

A

97. B is the correct answer since choices III
and IV are correct. Choice I is incorrect
because there was no governmental tak-
ing without compensation; the $25,000
is a fine, albeit an unconstitutional
one. If declared unconstitutional, the
money need not be paid. Choice III is
correct because there was a legislative
pronouncement meting out punish-
ment in the absence of a judicial trial,
contrary to Article I, § 10, clause 1 (the
Bill of Attainder Clause). Choice IV is
correct because this was punishment
for a crime which did not exist at the
time of its alleged commission. Such is
prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause
(Article I, §10, clause 1). Choice II is
incorrect because the Fifth Amendment
Due Process Clause is not applicable to
state citizens.

96. D is the correct answer. Mental and
physical impairment is not a suspect
classification under Equal Protection
Clause analysis, and, thus, the state
regulation need only meet the rational
basis test to be constitutional. City of
Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,
473 U.S. 432 (1985). Although there
is certainly a good argument that
the non-hiring of Hal was wrong; it
is, nevertheless, unprotected by the
Equal Protection Clause. Since it was
definitely implied that some individu-
als like Hal could not perform the work
and since it is common knowledge that
nuclear plants are ultra-hazardous; it is
quite clear that the state would meet
the minimal requirements of proving
a rational basis for their legislation.
Therefore, D is the correct answer. A
is incorrect because it ignores the ap-
plicable legal standard of analysis. B is
incorrect because it uses an incorrect
level of scrutiny (compelling interest).
C is incorrect because it misconstrues
the facts.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 223

98. D is the correct answer. Although,
before Article I, §9, clause 8 is quite
explicit: "No Title of Nobility shall be
granted by the United States", since this
is just what President George did, it is
clearly unconstitutional. However, B is
incorrect. The question asked whether
Rader suit will succeed. Even if a law
is unconstitutional, it can not be chal-
lenged by someone without standing
to sue. Rader 's claim is only that the
President has acted unconstitutionally.
The Court has stated in  Allen v. Wright
that such a claim is non-justiciable.
Thus, answer D is correct. Moreover,
that it has no significance is arguable.
It could foreshadow the beginning of a
monarchy — and even given that such
is insignificant, it is nevertheless un-
constitutional, but still irrelevant to the
question. Therefore A is incorrect. C is
incorrect because although it probably
is analogous to a Presidential Medal, it
is nonetheless expressly prohibited.

99. B is the correct answer. Dawson v. 
Delaware, 112 S.Ct. 1093 (1992), set
out a similar fact pattern. It was there
held that such a reference violated the
defendant's First Amendment Freedom
of Association rights. Association was
at issue because the defendant was be-
ing punished not for his criminal act, but
rather for the company he kept. There-
fore B is correct. A is incorrect because
it is a now long-standing principle of
constitutional criminal procedure that
capital punishment is not per se Cruel
and Unusual. C is not the best answer
because no facts indicate statements
or symbolic speech of the defendant
was used against him. It is also not the
best answer, because such is not how
the Court reasoned in Dawson, supra.
That is, there is High Court precedent
directly on point. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that B is correct. 

224 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

100. D is the correct answer. Since it was
stipulated that both Rawson and the
victim were white and that Rawson's
group advocated no related (or unre-
lated) crime, the statement of his mem-
bership is irrelevant. It infringed on
iiiiitng LI uin-iinuing. IL vJ aS
highly prejudicial, without being at all
probative. Dawson, supra answer 99.
Therefore, D is correct. A is incorrect
because it is totally irrelevant to the
given facts of this question. No facts
whatsoever indicated any prosecuto-
rial statements regarding impact to
the victim or his family. B is incorrect
because no facts were given which
would enable the student to discern
whether there was overwhelming other
evidence of guilt. Thus, although the
error could have been harmless, such
an analysis is extraneous to this ques-
tion's fact pattern. C is incorrect for
the same reasons that D is correct.

101. B is the correct answer. Under the
case of New York Times v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254 (1964), defamation suits
are limited by the First Amendment
— particularly when the allegedly
defamatory remarks concern a public

also be made knowingly or in reckless
disregard of their falsity. Since Jones
is a public figure, for there to be defa-
mation there must be knowledge or
recklessness (i.e., actual malice). Since
only choice B goes to this requirement,
though incompletely stated, it is the
best answer. A is incorrect because the
press often damages a person — but that
is the side effect of having free speech.
C is incorrect because the right to pri-
vacy essentially is only a limitation on
governmental conduct. D is incorrect
because it does not address any of the
elements of the New York Times v. 
Sullivan test.

2. Josey was convicted of false pretenses.
The judge instructed the jury as follows:

of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
Here, the prosecution must prove that
the defendant obtained title to property
of another by means of misstatement
of past or existing fact. If you find each
element proven by the facts, then the
defendant is guilty." The defendant was
convicted. His best ground of appeal,
based on the preceding, is:

a matter of law.

Q  

B. He has no grounds of appeal,
since the instruction was perfect.

look. After admiring it for some time, he
removed the ring and placed it back on the
table. As he settled down on the living room

pants off" Lionel Hart, the neighborhood
grouch. Their idea was to gain entry to Hart's
home and leap out at him as he was about to
enter upon returning home from work.

One evening about 9:00 p.m., Jesse drove
to Hart's house and, pushing open the al 
ready slightly-opened ground floor window,
they entered. While waiting for the moment
to arrive, Frank's eyes were attracted to a
small gold figurine standing on a bookcase.
Without Jesse's knowledge, Frank put it in

a charge of burglary would be:

A. That there was no breaking, since
the window was already open.

voluntary manslaughter would be:

A. The crime of manslaughter
merges with the greater crime of
burglary.

14. Ace and Don commit a bank robbery.
Don goes to his mother's and tells her,
"I am in trouble with the law. Hide me."

Questions 20 - 22 are based on the
following facts:

One hour after sunset, Cyrus Sinner set out
to enjoy himself. He had two fine Canadian
beers at a local bar, then decided he would
like a date. No one was interested. He then

a woman that night one way or another, even
if it had to be by force.

Cyrus decided to "create" a date with a
woman he had admired for months. He went
to Wanda's house and pushed her front win 
dow open with a crow bar. He put one foot
through and alarms went off. While running
away he was apprehended by Officer Tough,
who, while on patrol, was ordered by his
superior to investigate the alarms.

Tough placed Sinner under arrest, pursuant
to all legal requirements, but then, for good
measure, punched him in the stomach.

At trial, Sinner's attorney offered expert
medical testimony that Sinner was impotent.
Further, it was shown that Wanda was not
home that evening.

the jury, only one of which, the following,
however, has been appealed:

struct you on the requirement of intent nec 
essary for the crime of burglary. Such re 
quires an intent to commit a felony. No one
can truly know what goes on in another
man's mind. However, the subjective intent
required may be proven from an individual's

Otto was a "survivalist." He purchased a
semi-automatic Uzi machine gun at the lo-
cal gun shop. Even though he knew it to be
illegal, he modified the gun to be fully auto-
matic. The gun thus, at just one continuous
pull of the trigger, would keep on shooting
bullets.

Otto slept with the gun under his pillow. One
night, after Otto had anesthetized himself to
sleep (with a fifth of bourbon), Philip Pan-
ther broke into Otto's house. Although Pan-
ther was usually quite good at this kind of
thing, in this particular instance, he made a
tremendous racket entering. Otto's big 18 x
7 foot picture window overlooking the Pa-
cific was smashed.

Waking from his apocalyptical dream, Otto
grabbed his gun and ran to the scene of the
tumultuous entry. Panther was busily gath-
ering Otto's valuable cross-bow and arrow
collection. Otto, still legally intoxicated, and
in a blood rage, pulled the trigger. Otto be-
lieved he had to kill Panther to protect him-
self from Panther who had one cross-bow (a
deadly weapon) loaded and ready to fire.
Further, Otto wanted to kill Panther out of
the sheer joy of the kill. At Otto's one pull
of the trigger, fifteen bullets issued forth.
Thirteen of these entered the abdomen of
Panther.

torch, ran over to Otto's house, confronted
him through the smashed window, and
screamed, "I'll kill you, you crazy survivalist
nut! You killed my husband!"

Dumbfounded, Otto just stared at Mrs.
Sylvester. He then said, "Relax." Mrs.
Sylvester threw a makeshift torch at Otto.
The torch chipped a piece of glass away on
its way into the house. Otto ducked out of
the way. She fled. The torch ignited Otto's
home.

Otto called the fire department and waited
outside. Captain Ignite arrived in the city
firetruck. He knew Otto, and hated him. He
therefore purposely took his time in setting
up the hoses. His willful delay, in fact, caused
Otto's house to bum down.

Grunch then opened his own car. He had not
paid his law school for a gate card, but did
have several Chuck E. Cheese tokens, which

Questions 71 - 77 are based on the
following facts:

With the intent to steal all the belongings in
what appeared to be a fine beachfront house,
Jennifer picked the front door lock and
walked in. She was nervous, because it was
a full moon and she thought someone might
notice. However, there was nothing what 
soever in the house. Evidently, due to the
recent rain and landslides, the occupants had
moved out. The house was to be tom down
- as it was deemed to be on highly unstable
ground. Jennifer left.

Instead of driving home, however, she went
to a liquor store and picked out a $175 bottle
of Single Malt Scotch. While no one was
looking, she scraped off the price tag and
put on a price tag from a bottle of cheap
Scotch. That price tag read $7.99. Jennifer
paid the clerk $7.99 for the Scotch, put the
receipt in her purse and left.

She had a few quick gulps of the Scotch in
the car, felt a little "unsteady" from the al 
cohol, then drove home. It was a short drive
home, so Jennifer thought that there would
be no danger to herself or anyone. On her
way home, however, she missed seeing a
pedestrian (because of her intoxication) and
hit him. The pedestrian, Robert, was badly
injured and died from his wounds two weeks
later.

Miranda was prone to jealousy anyway, but
her new boyfriend, Stone, brought out the
worst in her. Although they supposedly had
a one-on-one relationship, Stone dated sev 
eral other women contemporaneously.
Miranda queried Stone about this, but he was
adamant and somewhat convincing in his
denials.

As a result of the above, Miranda decided to
"get Stone in a way that really hurt." One
late evening, Miranda called Stone up and
relayed to him the following ever-so-brief
conversation: "Come right over, Stone. I re 
ally want to make love."

Stone replied, "On my way." Stone jumped
into his car and made it to Miranda's apart 
ment in record time. He couldn't find the
key which Miranda had given him, so he
forced the front door open. He went to
Miranda's bedroom, found her naked in bed
and proceeded to have sexual relations with
her. However, soon after genital penetration,
Miranda said, "Stop. You're a heel and I'm
done with you. Get out of my house...now!"

totaled it as $3.59. The waiter gave Mason
the bill along with the food. Mason at once
observed that the bill was too low, and pon

with the waiter. While sipping the soft drink
and munching on the "Double Bypass" sand

with gun in hand, threatened to shoot Dick
immediately - ifhe did not leave. Dick said,
"Madam, I mean no harm; Ijust need a place
to sleep."

Marcia replied, "Two minutes, or you're
dead." Dick did not leave, and instead, said
to Marcia, "If you shoot that gun at me and
miss, believe me, you'll be sorry." Marcia
shot the gun at Dick and missed. Dick then

END OF QUESTIONS

2. C is correct. The jury instruction de 
fined a basic crime (false pretenses) but
left out any mens rea requirement. As a
general rule, true crimes should include
a mens rea and if they do not, there is a
possible due process violation. A is in 
correct because no facts whatsoever
were set out. Thus, one cannot reason 
ably conclude whether the evidence was
sufficient or insufficient. B is incorrect
for the same reason that C is correct. D
is incorrect because false pretenses re 
quires obtaining title, not "documentary
title." Documentary title is, in fact, not
a legal term of significance.

CRIMINAL LAW
ANSWERS

1. A is the "best" answer but it is not the
only correct answer. The Columbia stat 
ute punishes for substance addiction.
But, although the addict likely often has
a guilty mental state (the desire to have
the drug), he need not necessarily have
done any action whatsoever. Crimes
which so punish often violate due pro 
cess. They are called "status" crimes  
because they punish guilty status only.
Our system of justice requires that sta 
tus not be punished unless there also
occurs a guilty action (actus reus) and
guilty mental state (mens rea). Answer
A correctly, though briefly, states the
above reasoning. B is incorrect because
substance addiction, as a matter of law,
is considered to be voluntary intoxica 
tion only. Such is based on public policy
(to deter drug use) and because the first
use of the drug was voluntary. C is the
second best answer. This statutory
crime probably does not have a mens
rea, is therefore strict liability and strict
liability crimes are not preferred. How 
ever, answer A gives a more precise
description ofthe problem. D, although
arguably correct, is again far less pre 
cise than A.

CRIMINAL LAW I:Em

3. B is the correct answer. Solicitation to
commit burglary is enticing another to
commit burglary with the intent that the
other commit burglary. (Modernly, bur 
glary is the entry of the structure of an 
other with the intent to commit a felony
or petty larceny.) The facts stipulate that
Randy and Ready tried to get Able to
commit burglary and that Able declined.
Since there was a serious request to do
burglary, both elements of solicitation
are established. A is incorrect because
conspiracy requires that there be a meet 
ing of the minds and actual intent to do
a crime. Here, since Able declined, there
was no meeting of the minds and no
intent on the part of Able. C is incor 
rect because attempt requires that there
be a substantial step (dangerous prox 
imity to success), and here at the time
of the enticement the parties were not
nearly close enough to commission of
the crime. D is incorrect for the same
reason that B is correct - solicitation is
a crime and the enticement is a suffi 
cient actus reus (guilty action).

4. A is the best answer. Ready and Randy
had permission to borrow Able's car to
buy groceries - but not to commit a bur 
glary. This fraudulent misuse is an em 
bezzlement. Since they did not obtain
title to the car, Choice B is wrong. There
was no "false pretenses." Choice C is
wrong because there is no such crime
as "malicious trespass." Since Ready
and Randy did not have an intent to per 
manently deprive Able of his car (the
last element of larceny by trick) there
is no larceny by trick. Therefore, D is
incorrect.

5. B is correct. Ready and Randy entered
into a warehouse (walled structure) in 
tending to and committing a larceny.
Thus, all of the elements of modem bur 
glary have been satisfied. A is incorrect
because common law burglary requires
the breaking and entry occur at night
and to a dwelling house. Those two el 
ements are lacking here. C and Dare
incorrect for the same reason that B is
correct.

11m CRIMINAL LAW

6. C is correct. Larceny is the trespassory
(here, stealing) taking (stealing) and
carrying away (stolen from warehouse)
of the personal property of another (here
the painting) with the intent to perma 
nently deprive. The facts indicate that
all of the elements are present. Thus, a
larceny has been committed. A is incor 
rect because for there to be an em 
bezzlement, the defendant must be in
lawful possession of the property. Here,
Randy and Ready did not have lawful
possession of the painting. B is incor 
rect because false pretenses requires
that the defendant obtain title to the
property. Here, Ready and Randy did
not get title. D is incorrect for the same
reason that C is correct.

7. D is the best answer. Since Randy and
Ready were still in the process of hid 
ing the painting they were, arguably,
still in perpetration of the burglary. Use
of the felony murder rule, requires the
defendant to be in perpetration (includ 
ing, as here, flight from) of an inher 
ently dangerous felony (like burglary)
and that a death be the result. Use of
the felony-murder rule, at common law,
did not require that the defendant do or
even initiate the killing. Thus, Randy
can be found guilty of Ready's death,
even though it was a police officer who
did the killing. The killing was the re 
sult of the warehouse burglary. Thus,
D is the best answer. A is incorrect be 
cause, although the homicide could be
argued to be an involuntary manslaugh 
ter, there was absolutely no false pre 
tenses. That is, Randy did not obtain
title to the painting. B is incorrect be 
cause common law burglary requires
the breaking and entry occur at night
and to a dwelling. C is incorrect because
voluntary manslaughter also requires
there be "legally adequate provoca 
tion." Being upset because of resistance
to your burglary is objectively quite in 
adequate.

CRIMINAL LAW III

8. B is the best answer. Necessity or choice
of evils is a complete defense to all
crimes except murder and rape. Neces 
sity allows doing a criminal act in or 
der to avoid a greater calamity. Here,
since Sam was starving, stealing some
food (larceny) was better than his own
death. This, in fact, is a paraphrasing of
Sir Francis Bacon's famous maxim. A
is incorrect because when Sam took the
food (the actus reus), he intended to
steal it (the mens rea). Thus, the mens
rea and actus reus of larceny did con 
cur. C simply misreads the question.
The issue is not burglary here, but lar 
ceny of the ring. D is incorrect only
because it is imprecise. Due process or
"fundamental fairness" would be vio 
lated by punishing here, but the defense
of necessity is the more accurate legal
explanation.

9. A is correct. Attempt requires there be
a substantial step and that intent to do
the crime be present. Here, the facts
stipulate Sam did have the requisite in 
tent. However, after he formed the in 
tent he took no action - he simply took
a nap! Thus, there was not a substantial
step and the first element of attempt was
lacking. B is factually incorrect. Lar 
ceny is a crime against possession.
Here, however, the ring was not aban 
doned. It was still in possession of the
owner. It need not be on the victim's
person for there to be a larceny. Such
confuse the requirements of larceny
with those of robbery. C misreads the
question. The issue here is larceny of
the ring, not larceny of the food. More 
over, C is also incorrect because any
movement satisfies the carrying away/
asportation element. D is factually in 
correct. It is absurd to conclude that all
chattels in a summer home are "aban 
doned."

1m CRIMINAL LAW

10. C is correct. Burglary, at common law,
requires there be a breaking. This ele 
ment is satisfied when there is any
movement of the structure. Here, the
facts stipulate that the back door (where
Sam entered) was completely open.
Thus, there was no breaking. A is in 
correct because diminished capacity
was not a common law defense. B is
incorrect. Burglary is a crime against
habitation, but this was a habitation.
Having slept there and intending to
sleep there again is all that is required.
Since it was a summer home with quite
a few effects in it (food, ring, couch,
etc.), we can certainly infer the dwell 
ing requirements have been satisfied. D
is incorrect because the defense of com 
pulsion (or duress) requires that another
human threaten the defendant with im 
minent violence, so that the defendant
will commit a crime. There was no com 
pulsion here. This option confuses com 
pulsion with necessity.

11. D is the best answer. Frank, at 6 years
old, was irrebuttably presumed inca 
pable of committing a crime at common
law under the infancy defense. A is in 
correct because any movement of the
structure satisfies the breaking element,
and here the window was pushed open
wider. B is incorrect only because D is
a better answer. The boys' intent was to
assault, which was not a common law
felony. However, since B requires
weighing of facts and making infer 
ences, whereas D is obviously right be 
cause Frank's age is given, D is the bet 
ter answer. C is incorrect because it cre 
ates facts. No consent to enter was stipu 
lated or even implied.

12. B is the best answer. Conspiracy re 
quires there be an actual intent to do
the target crime. Involuntary man 
slaughter requires there be an uninten 
tional killing. There can, therefore, be
no conspiracy to do this crime. It is a
contradiction in terms. A is incorrect be 
cause manslaughter does not merge (is
not a lesser included offense) of bur 
glary. They are distinct crimes. C is in 
correct because guilt of "another crime"
does not relieve guilt. This statement is
silly. D is correct - there was no intent
to kill. However, B which dismisses the
validity of the whole charge, is a better
answer.

CRIMINAL LAW III

14. B is the best answer. An accessory af 
ter the fact or obstruction ofjustice, with
knowledge of the existence of a com 
pleted crime, helps hinder the arrest of
the perpetrator. Modernly, close rela 
tives, like the perpetrator's mother, are
often not prosecuted. Nevertheless, B
is the best answer, since the others are
entirely incorrect. Ais incorrect because
Don's mother did not agree with another
to commit a crime. C is incorrect be 
cause Don's mother was not a perpe 
trator of the robbery. D is incorrect be 
cause Don's mother was not involved
in the planning of the robbery.

13. A is the correct answer. Involuntary
manslaughter is the unintentional un 
lawful killing of a human with crimi 
nal negligence or when done in the per 
petration of a malum in se unlawful act.
Here, Jesse unintentionally killed Hart
by assaulting him. This action evi 
denced criminal negligence (Jesse
should have known of the risk) and also
satisfied the unlawful act-manslaughter
rule (assault is a malum in se unlawful
act). B is incorrect. Second degree mur 
der requires the presence of malice
aforethought. Here, there was no ex 
press malice (no intent to kill). Like 
wise, there was no intent to cause seri 
ous bodily injury and no conscious,
reckless disregard of the risk. Since
malice aforethought was lacking, there
was no murder in the second degree. C
is incorrect, factually and legally. This
was not an intentionallheat of passion
killing. It was an accidental killing.
Therefore, voluntary manslaughter is
incorrect, factually. Furthermore, it is
involuntary manslaughter and not vol 
untary manslaughter which is linked up
with the unlawful act-manslaughter
rule. C is, therefore, also legally incor 
rect. D is incorrect because accidental
killings certainly can lead to criminal
homicide convictions. Felony-murder
and involuntary manslaughter are two
such examples.

1m CRIMINAL LAW

15. C is correct. If a defendant commits a
crime while under the influence of
drugs or alcohol, even if the drugs make
him delusional, insanity is not available.
Only voluntary intoxication is relevant.
However, if the defendant has caused
himself brain damage by chronic use
of drugs - and is not then under the in 
fluence, insanity is relevant. Such is the
stipulated situation in this question.
Under the prevailing majority and com 
mon law M'Naghten insanity test,
Dugan had mental illness, a defect of
reason (the devil message) and did not
know this killing was wrong. Therefore,
M'Naghten is satisfied and Dugan is
legally insane. A is incorrect because
Dugan was not here intoxicated and is
also incorrect because voluntary intoxi 
cation cannot be a defense to a malice
crime like murder. B is incorrect. Al 
though Dugan did know what he was
doing (the nature and quality of his
acts), this element is only an option in
the M'Naghten test. M'Naghten can
also be satisfied if the defendant does
not know what he is doing to be wrong
- as here. D is incorrect because the
mistake of fact defense, for a malice
crime like common law murder, re 
quires the mistake to be objectively rea 
sonable. D is incorrect because it mis 
states the relevant law.

16. B is the correct answer. Battery is gen 
erally a low-grade misdemeanor. There
was certainly a battery here, as evi 
denced by the slaps. A and C are each
incorrect for two reasons. First, false
imprisonment and kidnapping are more
serious crimes. Second, it does not ap 
pear that there was a confinement  
thus, neither crime was committed. D
is incorrect because the negligent inflic 
tion of emotional distress is not a crime.
It is a tort.

17. B is the correct answer. Although it is a
close call, it appears that Bouncer com 
mitted two batteries: the initial shove
and the secondary slap. Thus, II is a bet 
ter choice. Moreover, since assault is a
lesser included offense of battery and
since there was an intentional scarring
(by way of the threat), III is also cor 
rect. Only answer B includes both II and
III.

18. A is the correct answer. The malice
aforethought element of murder can be
shown by an intent to kill. Vieux obvi 
ously possessed such. Since the other
elements of murder are present, such is
the correct crime. B is incorrect because
first degree murder was not a crime at
the common law. C is incorrect because
a requirement of voluntary manslaugh 
ter is that the killing follow immediately
upon the passion-provoking incident. A
day's wait is too long. D is incorrect
because involuntary manslaughter cov 
ers only unintentional killings, and this
killing was on purpose.

CRIMINAL LAW 1m

22. D is the correct answer. After a crime
has been committed, a crime by an of 
ficer does not retroactively limit the
guilt of the original perpetrator. Thus,
Tough's battery of Sinner is irrelevant.
A, Band C are incorrect for the same
reason that D is correct.

23. A is the correct answer. This is a very
tricky question. Since Smoak was the
manager, he was in more than mere cus 
tody and, thus, was capable of embez 
zling Tarno. Since he did not put
Chewer's money into the register, the
$6.88 he took out was Tamo's. Further,
he deprived Tamo of the $3.12. Thus,
he embezzled a total of $10. I is correct
and II is incorrect. Since it appears that
Smoak intended to steal Chewer's $100
before obtaining possession, the crime
is larceny (not embezzlement). Thus, III
is correct. II and IV are incorrect for
the same reasons that I and III are cor 
rect. Only choice A offers I and III.

24. D is the correct answer. In a slim ma 
jority of jurisdictions, an honest claim
of right negates the intent element of
the theft crimes. For that reason A, B
and C are incorrect.

19. C is the correct answer. Vieux had a
good faith but unreasonable belief that
the killing was necessary to protect her 
self- the exact requirement of this par 
tial defense. A is incorrect because
Vieux was the aggressor the following
evening -thus, self-defense is not avail 
able. B is incorrect because it was stipu 
lated that Vieux was legally sane. D is
incorrect because C is correct.

20. C is the correct answer. The entry ele 
ment of burglary is satisfied when any
part of the perpetrator's body penetrates
the dwelling. Since Sinner's foot pen 
etrated, C is a bad choice. A and Bare
incorrect because Sinner did intend to
rape, as stipulated in the facts. D is in 
correct because the jury instruction cor 
rectly defined the mens rea necessary
and correctly discussed whose burden
it was to prove such.

21. C is the correct answer. Attempted rape
requires that Sinner took a substantial
step toward rape (shown here by the
breaking and entering) and that he had
the intent to rape (shown here by the
facts). Thus, I and II are correct. Since
Sinner, in fact, intended to rape, and
rape is a crime, there was merely a fac 
tual impossibility - which is not a de 
fense. Thus, III is correct and IV is in 
correct. Only C offers I, II and III.

1m CRIMINAL LAW

25 . D is the correct answer. Deadly force is
never permissible when used merely to
protect property. Chewer's action was
larceny and Smoak used deadly force.
D, alone, states this relevant legal rule.
The guilt of the victim is irrelevant to
this question - thus, Band C are incor 
rect. Furthermore, A is incorrect be 
cause the earlier guilt of the perpetra 
tor is not relevant in this case.

26. B is the correct answer. Malicious mis 
chief covers the damaging of property.
A is incorrect because there was no dis 
membering. C and D are incorrect be 
cause there was no "taking" (control)
of any property.

27. C is the best answer. Often statutory
rape is considered to be strict liability;
thus, there are no defenses. However,
since such is not an option, we must
choose the "best" answer given. Cer 
tainly A is incorrect because consent is
not an element of this crime. Actually,
the alleviation of consent is the grava 
men of this offense. B is also totally
incorrect - Ted is obviously of age, so
the infancy defense is unavailable to
him. Since Ted in no way misunder 
stood the law, D is also incorrect. Thus,
we are left with C as the best choice.
Ted thought Jan was his wife and this
was a reasonable mistake under the cir 
cumstances.

28. B is the correct answer. Choice I is in 
correct because rape, at common law,
could not be committed by females.
Choice III is incorrect because for there
to be a burglary there must be "the in 
tent to commit a felony." Jan's intent
was, at worst, to commit the misde 
meanor of battery. Since Jan "offen 
sively" touched Ted, there is a battery.
Only II (and B) are correct.

29. Ais the best answer. Modernly, infancy
can be defined as under 18 years of age.
Jan is 17, so she might have such a de 
fense. B is incorrect since, literally, pub 
lic policy is not a defense. C is incor 
rect because Ted's consent was gained
by gross fraud/impersonation. Fraud in
the factum invalidates consent. D is in 
correct because in no way would the
equal protection clause mandate pref 
erential treatment of young women.

30. D is the correct answer. The sexual ag 
gressiveness of an underage female is
irrelevant to a charge of statutory rape.
Thus, choices I and III are incorrect.
Choice II is incorrect because the guilt
of the "victim" is not a defense at crirni 
nallaw. Choice IV is incorrect because
voluntary intoxication is not a defense
to a strict liability crime.

CRIMINAL LAW 1m

31. A is the correct answer. When Fawn
asked Jo to kill her, she was enticing Jo
to commit a murder. Thus, there was a
solicitation. Consent of the victim is no
defense to murder. Since Fawn did not
take a substantial step, there is no at 
tempt, and, thus, B is incorrect. Since
Jo did not agree, there is no conspiracy
and C is incorrect. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that A is correct.

32. D is the correct answer. Since Dr. Donna
only thought about killing Fawn: only
intended to kill. Thus, there was no
crime. Mens rea alone cannot be pun 
ished. Thus, A, Band C are incorrect.

33. C is the correct answer. When Ned used
the syringe on Fawn, there was an un 
lawful application of force - thus, I is
correct. When he decided to kill Fawn
and took the syringe and drugs, there
was a substantial step - and at that in 
stant there was the intent to kill. The
taking of the hospital's drugs and sy 
ringe was trespassory - thus, there was
a larceny. Only choice C includes I, II
and III.

1m CRIMINAL LAW

34. C is the correct answer. Note: the call
of this question is phrased in the nega 
tive. Since Donna died within a year of
the attack and from the attack, the "year
and a day" rule is inapplicable. So Jo
should not argue I (but I is correct be 
cause of the negative call of the ques 
tion). Although Jo was misinformed as
to who tried to kill her sister (it was
actually Ned), use of the mistake of fact
defense requires that: were the facts as
the defendant believed them to be the
conduct would not be criminal. But,
here, Jo's attack would still be unjusti 
fied. J0 should not make this argument
- thus, II is also correct. Since Fawn
was in no further danger, the imminence
element of defense of others is lacking,
so the argument in IV also should not
be made. Only choice C includes all of
these poor arguments. Since Jo was act 
ing under reasonable provocation, op 
tion III would be a viable argument.

35. C is the best answer. When an individual
is reasonably provoked (here by the at 
tempt on her sister's life), is actually
upset (stipulated in the facts), and has
insufficient time to "cool down" (the
attack occurred soon after the passion 
provoking incident) the rule of provo 
cation will mitigate murder to volun 
tary manslaughter. Although A, dimin 
ished capacity, is also a mitigation de 
fense, because it is such an extreme mi 
nority position, C is a better choice. B
and D are incorrect because they are not
mitigating factors. Rather, they are
complete defenses, excuses.

36. B is the correct answer. Since Joe was
in a managerial position, he had "law 
ful possession" of the money - not mere
custody. Since the other elements of em 
bezzlement are present, that is the cor 
rect choice. A is incorrect for the same
reasons that B is correct, i.e., there was
no trespass in the taking. C is incorrect
because, when there is a lawful posses 
sion, there is no trespass - which is a
requirement of larceny by trick. Al 
though there was a "trick," there was
no trespass - and, thus, no larceny by
trick. D is incorrect because title did not
pass, and such is a necessary element
of false pretenses.

37. D is the best answer. Clearly Joe com 
mitted a theft (based on embezzlement)
of Walls' accounts. Grand versus petty
theft is determined by fair market value
of what is stolen. A typical cut-off fig 
ure is $400. Although the facts are un 
clear as to the amount stolen, a reason 
able inference is that it was an "enor 
mous sum." Thus, D is better than C. A
is incorrect because no facts indicate Joe
received stolen property. B is incorrect
because fraud is not a crime.

38. A is the correct answer. Misprision is
the knowing concealment of the felony
of another. Walls' cover-up appears to
be such. B is incorrect because corpo 
rations can be found guilty of crimes.
C is incorrect because Joe likely com 
mitted a grand theft. D is incorrect for
the same reasons that A is correct.

39. D is the correct answer. I is incorrect,
since Mean neither threatened nor at 
tempted a battery. II is incorrect, since
Mean applied force to no one. III and
IV are incorrect, since they are torts, not
crimes. Thus, A, Band C, which include
I, II, III or IV, are incorrect.

40. B is the best answer. Since Shark and
Kerr reached a criminal agreement,
there was a conspiracy. Although Shark
also solicited Kerr, such merges in the
conspiracy. Therefore, A is not the best
answer. Since, at the time of hiring, no
substantial step was taken, there is no
attempt. C is incorrect. Similarly, at the
time of the hiring, no killing had oc 
curred - so there is no murder. D is in 
correct.

41. A is the correct answer. Since Shark
hired Kerr to kill Mean, such evidences
the premeditation and deliberation nec 
essary for first degree murder. More 
over, since Shark and Kerr were in
criminal combination, there was a con 
spiracy. Since only choice A includes
both of these crimes, it is the correct
answer.

CRIMINAL LAW 1m

45. B is the best answer. Note: The call of
this question is phrased in the negative.
We are looking for the worst argument.
Since ownership is not a requirement
oflarceny, this choice is truly poor. Al 
though this is a difficult, hair-splitting
question, it is somewhat typical of mul 
tiple choice exams. A is incorrect be 
cause the fact that property is lost can
sometimes preclude a conviction oflar 
ceny (if the intent to steal forms after
the taking), but sometimes is irrelevant
(if the intent forms prior to or at the time
of the taking). Thus, A is a mediocre
argument. C is incorrect because some 
times abandonment is a defense to lar 
ceny. Similarly, choice D is incorrect
because consent by the lawful posses 
sion is a defense to larceny.

46. D is the correct answer. Lott's taking
of the ring, which was then in lawful
possession, would amount to a grand
theft modernly (not a larceny - the com 
mon law term). Thus, II is correct and I
is incorrect. III is correct because a dam 
age to another's property is often, mod 
ernly, called "vandalism." Choice IV is
correct because, modernly, burglary
only requires an entry into a structure
with felonious intent. Only choice D
offers II, III and IV.

42. C is the correct answer. Kerr and Shark
were in criminal combination, thus,
choice I is correct. When Kerr killed
Mean, there was a premeditated intent
to kill, thus, satisfying the mens rea el 
ement of murder in the first degree.
Thus, choice II is correct. Modem law
burglary does not require the breaking
of a dwelling. Kerr broke into Mean's
office. Only choice C offers choices I,
II and III.

43. D is the best answer. Since when Lott
picked up the ring initially his intent
was neither to steal (larceny) nor to de 
fraud (embezzlement), A and B are in 
correct. C is incorrect for two reasons:
first, trespass is not a crime; and sec 
ond, even if it were, there is no trespass
when finding lost property provided
one's intent is to tum it in.

44. C is the correct answer. Choice I is cor 
rect because all of the elements of lar 
ceny are present (Lott took ring with
intent to keep it). Although one might
argue the "of another" element was
lacking, it was present. This element
refers to whether the "victim" (here the
police) had, at the time of the taking, a
lawful possession. They did. One can
commit larceny on property owned by
oneself. Choice II is also correct, be 
cause there was damage to the property
of another (the window) and, thus, there
was a malicious mischief. Since the
breaking and entering was not of a
dwelling, choice III (burglary) is not
present. Only choice C offers I and II.

Elm CRIMINAL LAW

47. C is the best answer. Mayhem includes
not only disfigurement; but also any
permanent damage to the body interfer 
ing with self-defense abilities. Paraly 
sis qualifies as such. Since the most
serious crime is always to be chosen
(unless the call of the question directs
otherwise), although there was a bat 
tery, such is not the best answer. There 
fore, A is incorrect. Choices Band D
are incorrect because John gave a con 
ditional consent - only and such is lim 
ited to the condition allowed. John did
not consent to the sleeper hold - he con 
sented to faking the sleeper hold.

48. B is the correct answer. Although this
is a close one, the involuntary intoxica 
tion defense would alleviate Snake's
guilt -since it was stipulated the hor 
mones were doctor-prescribed and that
they created a mental disorder (aggres 
siveness). A is incorrect for the same
reasons that B is correct. Although it
can be argued that Snake committed a
manslaughter, since his response to the
fan was based on words alone, the
provocation was insufficient. C is there 
fore incorrect. D is incorrect because
in order to utilize self-defense, there
must be an imminent attack and only
reasonable force may be used. Neither
situation here existed.

49. D is the best answer, because A, Band
C are incorrect. A is incorrect because
the gun was not "the property of an 
other" - an element of malicious mis 
chief. B is incorrect because there was
no sexual activity. C is incorrect be 
cause no aid was given to the enemies
of the state.

50. C is the correct answer. Panther fulfilled
all the elements of burglary. Moreover,
since Panther obtained control of at least
a cross-bow there was a larceny, as welL
Only choice C offers both burglary and
larceny.

51. B is the best answer. Otto used exces 
sive force per the statute. Thus, he is
responsible for Panther's injury. Al 
though the injury is likely more than a
battery, such is the best option listed. A
and C are incorrect for the same reason
that B is correct. D is incorrect because
Panther is still alive.

52. C is the correct answer. Either under the
misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, or
under the criminal negligence method,
Otto is responsible for the death of
Sylvester. Since the killing was unin 
tentional, all of the elements of invol 
untary manslaughter have been satis 
fied. There is no burglary at common
law, since there was no "breaking" and
no "intent to commit a felony." Thus,
A, Band D are incorrect. Additionally,
B is incorrect because there was no
malice, a requirement of murder.

CRIMINAL LAW Ell

53. A is the correct answer. Choice I is cor 
rect because there was a burning of
Otto's dwelling. Choice II is correct
because the torch not only broke the
window, but was also used to try to
complete the intended felony (murder).
Thus, legally there was an entry - even
though Mrs. Sylvester did not person 
ally enter Otto's home. Choice III is
correct because Mrs. Sylvester took a
substantial step toward completion of
murder with the intent to kill. Since Mr.
Sylvester was not then in danger, de 
fense of others is unavailable. Only A
offers I, II, and III.

54. D is the correct answer. This is a diffi 
cult question. More than one party can
be guilty of a single crime - even if they
were acting independently - provided
that both perpetrators were substantial
factors (causation), as here. Moreover,
if there is a legal duty to act and no act
is performed, the perpetrator is crimi 
nally liable under an omission theory.
Such was our situation. A is incorrect
because "willful delay" is not a crime.
B is incorrect because "culpable omis 
sion" is not a crime - it is merely a
method of proving causation. C is in 
correct because such is not a crime.

55. D is the correct answer. At the common
law, the inflicted wound must result in
death within "a year and a day." As
stipulated, the death here took two
years. Thus, all of the homicides: A, B
and C are incorrect. At worst, under
these facts, there would be a battery or
mayhem. These options were not of 
fered.

56. B is the correct answer. Choice I is in 
correct because the statute was highly
relevant, as shown by the following.
Choice II is correct because Otto did
willfully modify the gun. Choices III,
IV and V are correct because, by defi 
nition, use of such a weapon precludes
use of defenses which would otherwise
be available. Use of such a weapon is
a, per se, unreasonable use of force.
Only B includes choices II, III, IV and
V.

57. A is the correct answer. Since there was
a trespass in the taking of the car, and
the intent to permanently deprive
formed during the taking, there is a con 
tinuing trespass larceny. B is incorrect
since no facts indicate that Layla got
possession by trick. C is incorrect since
no facts indicate that Layla was en 
trusted (lawful possession of Eric's car).
D is incorrect because title to Eric's car
did not pass; thus, there can be no false
pretenses.

BiB CRIMINAL LAW

58. D is the correct answer. Since the mens
rea of burglary (intent to commit a
felony) must concur with the actus reus
(breaking and entering, etc.), and at the
time of the breaking there was no felo-
nious intent, there can be no burglary.
Thus, choice I is incorrect. Since Cindy
stole the food, there was a simple lar-
ceny; and choice II is correct. Since
Cindy was not entrusted in lawful pos-
session, of the food, there is no em-
bezzlement and, thus, choice III is in-
correct. Only D offers choice II alone.

59. D is the correct answer. For there to be
a burglary, there must be intent to com-
mit a felony in the dwelling. Mike did
not have the required intent. Thus, D is
correct. A is incorrect because it misses
this fundamental requirement. B is in-
correct because the issue is not whether
a felony was actually committed, but
rather was the intent felonious. C is in-
correct because entry by instrumental-
ity is valid if, as here, the instrumental-
ity is used to complete the felony. In
this case, the bullet was used to kill.

60. C is the correct answer. The killing was
a classic "depraved heart" killing. Mike
was aware of the substantial risk to hu-
man life, and ignored such. A and Bare
incorrect because they are modern
crimes. D is incorrect for the same rea-
son that C is correct.

61. D is the best answer. A correct answer
requires knowledge of a hairline distinc-
tion. Dogs were not personal property
at the common law, so technically this
was not a malicious mischief. Both B
and C were not common law crimes,
so D is the best answer.

62. C is the best answer. When the bullet
penetrated the roof, it probably dam-
aged something in Arnold's home -
thus, there was probably a malicious
mischief. Although this is not a "cor-
rect" answer, it is the "least worst" of
the alternatives. As such, this is a very
tricky question. Choices II, III and IV
are all incorrect because these crimes
required three perpetrator participants.

63. C is the correct answer. The killing was
a classic heat of passion killing. There
was provocation (the betrayal), passion
(Charles' anger), and insufficient time
to cool. Thus, II is correct and I is in-
correct. When Charles threatened and
chased Denise there was an assault; but,
since there was no application of force,
there was not a battery. Thus, III is cor-
rect and IV is incorrect. Only Coffers
the above.

64. D is the best answer. Since an acciden-
tal spilling of beer on a person evi-
dences no mens rea whatsoever,
Choices A, Band C are incorrect; and
D is the best answer.

CRIMINAL LAW E!S

65. A is the correct answer. This is a clas 
sic involuntary manslaughter, based on
the misdemeanor (unlawful act) theory,
Arnold committed a battery and Beth
died accidentally as a result of such.
Thus, choice I is correct and II is incor 
rect. Since Arnold was upset and sim 
ply "forgot" to pay for his food, there
was no specific intent to defraud or de 
prive; thus, choices III and IV are in 
correct. A, alone, includes only choice
I.

66. B is the correct answer. False Impris 
onment occurs when another is con 
fined without consent. Confinement
does not require there be a room. Thus,
in this fact pattern, Hannah's movement
was confined in the open fields - by
way of gun threat. A is incorrect because
Rape requires sexual penetration. C is
incorrect because Battery requires there
to be an application of force and none
was shown here. D is incorrect for the
same reasons that B is correct.

67. C is the correct answer. Battery is an
unlawful application of force to the per 
son of another. Gronch's touching of
Betty's hair was purposeful and cer 
tainly unapproved or "offensive." Betty,
in the facts, did say to stop. Of course,
had Betty consented, there would have
been no Battery. Therefore, although C
could have been more legally precise,
it is a correct answer - and, as it turns
out, the best of the group. A misreads
the facts - Betty told Gronch to stop  
therefore, it was offensive. B is legally
incorrect because a given act can be
both a tort and a crime. Such are en 
tirely separate issues. D is incorrect for
the same reason that C is correct.

68. D is the correct answer. Malicious mis 
chief is the malicious damaging of
another's property. Since Grunch
scratched (damaged) the car, since it
was Phil's and since he did it purposely
(thereby satisfying the malice element),
all the elements are met. A is incorrect
because nothing in the common law
crime of malicious mischief requires the
vandalism to be irreparable. B is incor 
rect because such is a tort, not a crime.
C is incorrect because there was no tak 
ing, carrying away... or for that matter
- there were few elements of theft
proven by the facts.

e CRIMINAL LAW

69. B is the correct answer. This is a very
difficult question. Choice I is incorrect
because forgery requires the making of
a false document. Although it is argu 
able the Grunch's token constituted a
document; it is quite clear, he did not
make it. Therefore, since one element
is missing, this crime is lacking. Choice
II, however, is probably correct. Utter 
ing only requires the using of a forged
instrument knowing it to be such. Al 
though a Chuck E. Cheese token, in the
context of going to Chuck E. Cheese,
is not false; using it as a token of value
somewhere else probably is. Moreover,
it was used to defraud the law school.
Thus, there probably was an uttering.
Choice III is incorrect, for two reasons.
First, false pretenses require the defen 
dant obtain title fraudulently. No facts
indicate Grunch to have obtained title
to the token, itself, fraudulently. Sec 
ondly, and more to the point, Grunch
received no title to anything of the vic 
tim law school. He simply borrowed a
parking space without paying. If the
intent to steal (defraud) forms prior to
obtaining possession, then the posses 
sion is not lawful and there can be no
embezzlement. In that instance, the
crime is larceny. Although the facts are
not perfectly clear, it appears that since
Grunch had the false token, he prob 
ably intended to use it prior to entering
the lot - so his possession of the park 
ing space was not in good faith. There 
fore, the crime is Larceny (choice IV),
not embezzlement (choice V). Since
only B includes just II and IV, it is the
correct answer.

70. B is the correct answer. Conversion with
fraudulent intent, by one with lawful
possession, constitutes the crime of
embezzlement. Since Grunch acciden 
tally took the tokens outside the restau 
rant, and since they were presumably
lent to him by the restaurant, he had the
requisite lawful possession. A is incor 
rect because for there to be a larceny
there must be an initial "trespass"  
here, there was none. C is incorrect be 
cause false pretenses requires there be
a passing of title; and there was none
here. D is incorrect for the same rea 
sons that B is correct.

71. C is the best answer. Note: the call
asked, which was the worst legal argu 
ment. Since no one has to be home, pro 
vided the house is a dwelling and the
perpetrator has felonious intent, choice
C is factually irrelevant. Choices A and
B, however, are actually good argu 
ments. Under the common law, aban 
doned houses are not considered to be
dwellings. So, there can be no common
law burglary of this stipulated-to-be
abandoned house. D is incorrect, for the
same reason that C is correct.

CRIMINAL LAW â€¢

72. D is the correct answer. Forcible entry
entails the willful trespass onto the land
of another by force. The force required
is not necessarily destructive force.
Thus, Jennifer's picking of the lock sat 
isfies this element. Moreover, she was
clearly trespassing onto land - so all of
the elements are met. A is incorrect be 
cause an abandoned dwelling is not a
"dwelling" for common law burglary
purposes. B is incorrect for the same
reasons that D is correct. C, though a
correct statement, is not as precise a
definition of the common law crime
here committed.

73. C is the correct answer. When title is
obtained fraudulently, the crime is false
pretenses. Here, the lie was in the act
of changing price-tags and title passed
with the passing of the receipt. A and B
are incorrect because there was no tres 
pass in the taking. D is incorrect because
Jennifer was in bad faith, not "lawful
possession" of the Scotch - and such is
a requirement of embezzlement.

74. D is the correct answer. Jennifer com 
mitted the crime of false pretenses, be 
cause she obtained title fraudulently.
The fact that the clerk was an accom 
plice, does not alleviate Jennifer's guilt.
Of course, the answer would differ had
the owner known and consented to
Jennifer's actions. A is incorrect be 
cause the consent needed was of the
store owner - and no facts indicate such.
B is incorrect because condonation is
not a defense to a crime, once it is com 
pleted. Although C is a correct state 
ment of law, it is irrelevant because tres 
pass is not an element of false pretenses.

75. A is the correct answer. There is an
embezzlement when a trusted em 
ployee, in lawful possession of a chat 
tel, fraudulently converts it. That was
the situation here. B is incorrect because
there was no trespass by the clerk; and
this is an element of larceny. C is in 
correct because conversion is not a
crime. It is a tort, only. D is incorrect
because the clerk's actions satisfied all
of the elements of embezzlement. It is
irrelevant whether it was good business.

â€¢

CRIMINAL LAW

76. C is the correct answer. Involuntary
manslaughter is essentially a criminally
negligent, accidental killing. Jennifer's
driving under the influence was such a
deviation from the reasonable standard
of care owed. Choices A and Dare in-
correct because they were not crimes
at common law (which is the stipulated
jurisdiction). Choice B is incorrect be-
cause murder requires malice afore-
thought. This mens rea can be proven
by an intent to kill (not present here),
intent to cause serious bodily injury
(also not present here), reckless/de-
praved heart (not present here because
Jennifer was unaware of the risk to life),
or felony-murder (not present here, be-
cause she was not in perpetration of a
dangerous felony).

77. D is the correct answer. At the common
law, the inflicted wound must produce
death within 12 months. This specific
rule of causation was called the "year
and a day" rule. Here, the death oc-
curred 13 months later. Choice A is in-
correct for the very same reasons that
D is correct. Choice B, though correct
analysis at common law, is far less spe-
cific than choice D. Thus, D is the bet-
ter answer. C is incorrect for the same
reasons that D is correct.

78. D is the correct answer. This is the case,
because A, B, and C were not crimes at
common law.

79. A is the best answer. Vandalism entails
the damaging of another's property.
Since the lockpicking was likely not
consented to, damage to the door is a
reasonable possibility. Band Dare
clearly incorrect because they were
crimes only at common law - and the
call stipulated [only] modern law
crimes. C is clearly incorrect because
no felonious intent (as required by bur-
glary) is indicated by a reasonable in-
terpretation of the facts.

80. A is correct. Under both the modem and
common law, the consent to engage in
sex can be withdrawn at any time - even
after sexual intercourse has com-
menced. B is a correct statement of fact,
but is irrelevant. C is incorrect for the
same reasons that A is correct. D is in-
correct, legally, because sexual penetra-
tion is all that is required for carnal
knowledge.

81. B is the correct answer. Malicious mis-
chief is the malicious damaging of the
property of another. Stone demonstrated
the requisite intent, and the smashing
certainly appears to be damage. More-
over, it was Miranda's picture. A and C
are incorrect because they were not
crimes at the common law. D is incor-
rect because uttering entails offering a
forged instrument- facts totally irrel-
evant here.

CRIMINAL LAW BiD

82. B is the correct answer. A killing, fol 
lowing a sexual betrayal, is the classic
voluntary manslaughter scenario. With
such, there is actual provocation, anger
and an immediate killing. A is incorrect
because when the elements of volun 
tary manslaughter are present, as here,
it takes precedence over murder. C is
incorrect because this crime requires the
killing to be unintentional. D is incor 
rect both legally and ethically.

83. D is the correct answer. A is incorrect
because there was no touching. B is in 
correct because there was neither a sub 
stantial step toward battery (there was
only "preparation"), nor was there an
intent to scare anyone. C is incorrect
because it requires reading in an essen 
tial fact not even hinted at, i.e., that it
was not his gun.

84. A is the correct answer. At common law,
malicious mischief included the dam 
aging of another's horse. Band C are
incorrect because they were not com 
mon law crimes. D is incorrect because
treason requires giving aid to the en 
emies of the state, and no facts suggest
this.

85. D is the best answer. There is a larceny,
provided the defendant intends to aban 
don the property in such a way that the
owner is unlikely to recover it. Although
these facts are amorphous on this point,
it is the best of the choices given. A is
an incorrect answer-many crimes in 
volve emotional outbursts - and such
is not a defense. B is incorrect because,
under the facts given, there was cer 
tainly a malicious mischief (vandalism)
and quite possibly a larceny. C is incor 
rect because Cereal was the "taker," not
the "receiver" of stolen property.

86. B is the correct answer. Cereal demon 
strated malice aforethought - by his in 
tent to either kill or seriously injure
Jane. Therefore, there was a second-de 
gree murder. A is incorrect because
there was no premeditation and delib 
eration regarding the killing of Jane  
and these are required elements of
first-degree murder. The anger Cereal
felt for Melody cannot be transferred
to reduce his crime on Jane. Thus, C,
voluntary manslaughter, is incorrect. D
is incorrect because the most reason 
able interpretation of the facts is that
Cereal either intended to kill or hurt
Jane seriously - thus, the more serious
crime of second-degree murder is
present. (The most serious homicide
committed will be the correct answer.)

â€¢

CRIMINAL LAW

87. A is the correct answer. At the time of
the killing, Cereal was likely mentally
deranged and may not have known right
from wrong. B is incorrect for two rea 
sons: Killing an uninvolved third party
is not legally adequate provocation; and
this Rule is not a complete defense. C
is incorrect because it misreads the facts
- Cereal admitted he had not mistaken
Jane for Melody. D is incorrect because
this was not a common law defense, and
also because it is only a partial defense.

88. D is the best answer. Cereal's mental
faculties were diminished because of
the earlier betrayal. Although dimin 
ished capacity is a minority position, it
is the best of the choices given. A is
incorrect because killing an innocent
third party who simply has a resem 
blance to your ex-lover, is not legally
(objectively) valid provocation. B is
incorrect because Insanity is not a par 
tial defense. C is incorrect, because
Cereal did not have the belief that he
was in imminent physical danger.

89. D is the correct answer. The criminal
law does not require good behavior. It
simply prohibits bad conduct. Mason's
leaving alone the old man was unethi 
cal, but not illegal in any way. Thus,
the crimes offered in choices A, Band
C are incorrect answers.

90. D is the correct answer. When Mason
paid up, he received title to the food,
fraudulently. There was false pretenses.
A is incorrect because larceny requires
a trespass in the taking- and Mason re 
ceived the food consensually. B is in 
correct because larceny by trick requires
tricking the victim into giving the chat 
tel- since Mason did not trick the waiter
into producing the food, this crime was
not present. C is a more difficult analy 
sis. For there to be an embezzlement,
the perpetrator must be in lawful pos 
session prior to his misappropriation.
Therefore, D is the better answer. Ma 
son probably did not have "lawful pos 
session," as required for there to be an
embezzlement.

91. B is the correct answer. Petty theft is
the fraudulent misappropriation of
property worth, as a general rule, un 
der $400. The food fell within this fair
market value, and Mason had the req 
uisite intent to underpay. A is correct,
but less specific than B, and, therefore,
B is the better answer. C is incorrect
because grand theft entails misappro 
priation of property over $400 - cer 
tainly not the case here. D is incorrect
for the same reasons that B is correct.

CRIMINALLAW lim

94. D is the correct answer. There is no
theory in which Mason could be held
criminally responsible for the death of
the pedestrian. A is incorrect because
he was not a substantial factor. B is in 
correct because it is a tort doctrine; and
irrelevant in any case. C is incorrect
because it goes to the mental state of
taking a reckless risk to human life.
Mason did not possess such.

95. C is the correct answer. Wharton's Rule
indicates that if a crime requires a set
and necessary number of perpetrators,
if only that minimum number is in 
volved, then the perpetrators cannot be
convicted of both the conspiracy and
the target crime. The definition which
was given for Breach of the Peace re 
quires four individuals. That was the
number involved - so there cannot be
conviction for both the Breach and the
conspiracy. A is a possibly correct an 
swer - but it requires reading in facts  
so C is better. Like A, B requires read 
ing in unlikely facts; so choice C is a
better answer. D is a misinterpretation
of obvious social mores, and is there 
fore incorrect.

92. A is the correct answer. Grand theft is
the fraudulent misappropriation of
property valued at, as a general rule,
over $400. Mason's car certainly ex 
ceeded that amount and Teena's con 
duct gives rise to the inference that not
only did she misappropriate the car  
but also that she intended to defraud. B
is incorrect because petty theft covers
stealing property of value under $400  
and the car here was worth much more
than that. C is incorrect because no facts
indicate damage to the car (and such is
required for there to be a vandalism).
D misreads the facts: Neither actual nor
constructive consent was given.

93. A is the correct answer. Involuntary
manslaughter can be proven by show 
ing that the defendant's killing occurred
while perpetrating a "malum in se" (bad
in itself) crime. Here, Teena was in per 
petration of a larceny (car theft) and this
will allow use of the so-called
"misdemeanor-manslaughter" rule. B is
incorrect because no facts indicate
Teena's driving to be a gross deviation
from the reasonable standard of care
owed. C is incorrect because sufficiency
of the evidence is an appellate or
post-trial procedural defense. The call
of the question asked for prosecution
arguments. D is incorrect because "de 
praved heart" is a method of proving
malice aforethought. It is not an element
of involuntary manslaughter, and, thus,
is irrelevant to this question.

BID CRIMINALLAW

96. C offers the best choice in a series of
poor answers. Although it does appear
Finn was in possession of the mari 
juana, perhaps it can be argued that
Nasty simply left it at Finn's home, and
Finn had not exerted dominion and con 
trol over it. A is incorrect because Finn
clearly knew the substance to be mari 
juana. B is legally incorrect because the
inducement to commit a crime must be
from a government agent - not a pri 
vate party, as here. D is also legally in 
correct because evil motives are not a
requirement for conviction of crimes.

97. A is the correct answer. Necessity, or
"choice of evils," is a defense when a
criminal act is performed, so as to avoid
a greater harm to the perpetrator. Al 
though, here, there may not have been
a legitimate necessity, of the given
choices, it is the best. B is incorrect
because Duress is only relevant when
one performs a crime at the imminent
threat of another. Both choices C and
D are incorrect because neither are de 
fenses at Criminal law.

98. C is the correct answer. Forcible Entry
requires there be force used in the tres 
pass. No force was evident here. A is
incorrect for the same reason that C is
correct. B is incorrect because the guilt
of the victim is not a criminal law de 
fense. D is legally incorrect - this was
a crime at common law.

99. A is the correct answer. On the facts
given, it appeared that in no way was
Dick attempting a burglary, arson or a
crime against Marcia's person. Thus,
Marcia utilized deadly force just to pro 
tect her property. The criminal law does
not allow this. [Note: The mere threat
of physical force is, however, allowed.]
B is a correct statement, but choice A is
a better answer, because it is more spe 
cific - it gives the legal reason. C is in 
correct for the same reasons that A is
correct - Marcia was not defending her
habitation. D is incorrect because the
guilt of the victim does not allow an
excessive use of force against that vic 
tim.

100. B is the best answer. The question did
not ask for reasons; instead it asked for
"affirmative defenses." Of the choices
given, only B is a true affirmative de 
fense. Moreover, B is a fairly good
choice, because one is permitted to do
an otherwise criminal act to avoid a
greater harm. Here, Marcia's deadly
assault was averted by Dick. Although
Dick ordinarily would have had no
right to take her gun, under these cir 
cumstances, it was acceptable. The
weakness with Dick's position is that
he was trespassing - and Necessity re 
quires substantial "innocence" on the
part of the defendant. It should also be
noted that Necessity requires ceasing
the necessary criminal ("evil") act, as
soon as the necessity ceases. In throw 
ing the gun in Marcia's garbage pail
and fleeing, Dick met most, if not all,
of the requirements of Necessity. A
offers an element of Self-Defense- but
it does not state that such is the rel 
evant defense. Therefore, B is a better
answer. Moreover, Self-Defense may
not be available - since Dick's pres 
ence was illegal (i.e., he was not "in 
nocent" as required by Self-Defense).
C is a correct statement, which dis 
proves the last element of robbery.
However, it has nothing to say about
the battery - and most importantly, it
is not an "affirmative defense" - as the
call of the question demands. D is in 
correct because, not only is Diminished
Capacity not a true affirmative defense;
it is also incorrect because no facts
whatsoever indicate that Dick's men 
tal clarity was significantly impaired.
